My sister said the hard area has decreased in size and i felt i too but not so certain. But i am confused as to why the hard area is not seen in mamogram or ultrasound? And why is the surgeon concerned when the radiologyst seemed to think it is part of the breast tissue? Thanks again!",

I am sure there will be treatments and you are going to be okay. May i ask what kind of biopsy did the doctor do? Because the surgeon wanted to do an open surgery biopsy as it was a big area and a core biopsy won't be sufficient. Does anyone know how much does it cost for an open biopsy? Thanks everyone. And Yuyueno, be strong! God Bless!",

      "Content": "renny85 wrote: Hi everyone! I am so worried about my sister who is 27 years old. About 2 years ago, she has a grape size lump at the 1 o'clock position on her left breast. She told me she went to the doctor and he said it was benign. About a month ago, my aunt noticed a hard lump more like a hard area at the 12 o'clock position on her left breast. I bought her health insurance and made an appointment at the UCLA breast center. The surgeon said she is more worries about the hard area at the 12 o'clock position compared to the small lump that has been there for 2 years. She ordered an ultrasound and mammogram and eventually a core biopsy guided by mammogram of the small lump. The ultrasound and mammogram both showed oly the small lump and not the hardened area. The radiologist seemed to think that the hard area is part of the breast tissue. The biopsy result of the small lump showed that it is fibroadenoma which is a huge relieve for us. It is about 3 weeks after the biopsy and the hard area seemed harder and the right side of her breast seemed to have a hard area too but not as big as her left. The surgeon wanted to do a open surgery biopsy of the large area but at that time my sister's left breast is still swollen because of the biopsy so we decided to wait a little. Is it something to be worried about when both the ultrasound and mammogram showed nothing at all on the large area? Is it considered fibrocystic codition? I am so so scared right now. Please share your thoughts. Thank you. God Bless everyone! Log in to post a reply",

Yuyueno please update me with your biopsy results. I think my sister's case is like yours. The insurance is only a month old. And we still have to pay $200 something and there's another bill for $200 something from UCLA. She first went to a free clinic but the doctor seemed to just not really care especially for women at her age. I tried calling the free clinic but the appointment is just way too long. My sister is really calm about her breast condition when she knew she had a lump. I was the one who is so worried. I am glad that the small lump turned out to be fibroadenoma. It had been there for 2 yaes. But the thickening hard large lump was recent i think. But it did not show up on ultrasound or mammogram. And she said it got smaller. I felt that it is a little smaller. I hope it is a good sign. And i think we can only pray for everyone here. God be with everyone! God Bless!",
