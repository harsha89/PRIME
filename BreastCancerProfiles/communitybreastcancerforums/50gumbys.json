    "Content": "50gumbys wrote: I had a biopsy last week to determine if Paget's is present. Tomorrow I see the surgeon for the results. Since there was slight weeping, tenderness, itching - all of these things, I'm thinking that cancer will be there. I first got to breast screening over a month ago and that's when everything started. Since then - and waiting for my biopsy - I've gone completely alkaline in my diet. I've been taking a natural medicine using reishi mushrooms - clean as a whistle! But tomorrow IS looming - I mean, once I hear the diagnosis and know that this really IS cancer; I can deal with it. I have a naturopath's appointment the following day and we'll start working on this straight away. I was wondering if there are any other women here who have gone through Paget's? I've heard it's a rare form of breast cancer and haven't come across anyone with it as yet. Give me a shout if you have! Many thanks. Lori Hughes Log in to post a reply",
