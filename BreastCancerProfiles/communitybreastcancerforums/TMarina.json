Google the brand or even prosthetics+your state and you may find some stores that sell items to help with breast cancer. My cami was stretchy enough to step into.  Unfortunately it didn't offer enough support for my remaining breast, so i couldn't use it in public.  I'd have one \"up high\" breast using the soft breast form I was given, and 1 naturally saggy breast.  I had to have my sis run to the store to buy a sport bra and some soft bras so i could go out in public (I stayed home for the first 5 days or so).  Next week maybe I'll be able to get a real prosthesis. I used a lanyard around my neck for my drain.  And when I left the house I just put in it in my pants pocket--worked perfect for me! If you are real nervous in the pre-op area, ask for something to calm you!   I stayed overnight 1 night, and luckily my hosp. has just been re-done and all the rooms are private!  Very nice!  I took percoset at home for a couple of days, then switched to ibuprofen.  Some people like to alternate ibuprofen and tylenol every couple of hours. Less than a week post surgery I didn't need any pain meds!  But I'm sure those having a bmx probably have more pain than a uni.  Its been difficult for me to remember not to use my left arm, esp. when getting out of bed (and holding my grandson!!), I can't imagine how hard that must be with a bmx!  My thoughts and prayers are with all of you ladies!  You are all strong women!  Soon you will be on the other side!

I think the oncs. have a standard treatment they start you out on, then they try different meds if the first ones don't work. The key is to take something at the first sign of nausea--don't wait to see how bad it gets.  And keep saltines or something similar on hand--I love those oyster crackers!  You don't want your stomach to get empty.

I did not know it can be addicting.  I don't use it often, just for stressful situations, like today, and for occasional nausea.  I don't need it for tests or anything, just the dang stress of being back in that stupid chair again!  I hope your \"problem\" gets resolved soon, w/o too much discomfort! gillyone-->thanks for popping in to give us some much needed encouragement! I just got back from my first AC treatment.  The whole thing, including labs, took about 3.5 hours.  Next time will be a bit longer because I'll see my onc. too.  I got Decadron and Zofran through my port  (seems to be the standard at my cancer center). Oh--because Emend worked well for me in the past, the nurse made sure I got some today, so I'm not sure if the doc was going to give it to me anyway, or just did because the nurse asked.  So before the infusion started I took an Emend pill, and then I'll take 1 a day for the next 2 days.  Emend helps with delayed nausea.  After the pre-meds, the nurse gave me the Andriamycin (red devil).  It was pushed in with a large syringe.  She pushes it very slowly so it mixes with the saline that is also going in.  Every couple of minutes she would pull it back to pull blood out to make sure my veins were ok.  She said problems are less likely to happen with a port, but they still take precautions.  I can expand on that more if there are questions.  She did 3 syringes of that @ 5 min. each.  Oh, and she gave me ice chips to help ward off mouth sores while I was getting the drug. Then she started the Cytoxan.  That bag took an hour. So, other than the nerves and upset stomach from being back at chemo, everything went well.  It helps that I'm familiar with the place, and the nurses know me.  I just am a little tired and blah feeling.  I've noticed most ladies here feel the worst a few days out, and the nurse agreed that that's what usually happens.  My throat seems a little scratchy too, hmmm.  Since I got enough steroids in the infusion, I won't take a pill until the morning.  Hopefully I can sleep tonight, but that is somewhat unlikely.  I'll probably end up in the recliner flipping through channels! Hope to hear from roosje and lizzyanne, to see how they did!  Praying it went well for them! Hoping all goes well for those soon to start too! T",

I asked my onc all my questions about low blood pressure, low wbc counts, fevers, etc., and basically, I survived so I'm good to go for the next round!  All my counts were back up thanks to the Neulasta!  I found out that Neulasta doesn't keep the counts from dropping, it just shortens the time that they are low.  We need to be very careful with handwashing, etc, but don't need to wear masks or seclude ourselves (unless that makes you feel more comfortable!).  My Neutrophils were so low that they showed up on the computer as 0!  But as long as they come back up, I guess that's acceptable.  The low bp/light-headedness could have been from lack of fluids, chemo se, getting sick, etc.  If I have another bad episode I need to call my onc.  And, of course, watch the temps. So, we'll see how this round goes!  I will try to drink more fluids next weekend--i know I drink a few glasses a day, but probably not as much as I need to. Hope everyone's elses se's are minimal!!!

I got a compazine pill, decadron infusion, and a bag of benedryl and prevacid.  Apparently the prevacid helps with allergic reactions too.  I got the Herceptin first ( a double dose the first time--took 90 minutes), then the Taxol.  The nurse started the Taxol super slow, then came back every 5 min. to increase the speed.  She did that 4 or 5 times, then I was up to normal speed.  The only se I had was the bottom of my feet got hot--like I had been walking on a hot sidewalk.  Maybe I had this reaction because I already have neuropathy?  Or maybe its just normal? The nurse wasn't too concerned, as long as everything else was ok.  The Taxol will take 3 hours each time.  For the 3rd and 4th txs they will cut the benedryl in half.  My onc told me this could make my neuropathy worse, and could make it permanent, or could take several months to a few years to fade away.  I am to let him know if it is getting worse, and be careful not to cut myself, etc. My MUGA went from 65% to 59%.  He said its still ok, although the drop is out of the range of the margin of error.  But he said there are lots of things that contribute to the score on any given day, so its not necessarily from the Adriamycin.  I will have my next scan in 3 months, unless I start having some problems before that.

I hope everything works out for you!  Hopefully if you get the right instructions and take the meds before you really need them, maybe you'll do better this round. You're in my prayers!! Tina",

I, too, am sorry some are having ins. trouble.  That's the last thing you need to deal with now.  I know that I am blessed to have such good ins.  We've hardly paid anything out of pocket.  There were a few things that needed pre-approval (like the neupogen shots), but other than that, not much trouble.  I'm one that is really afraid of the new healthcare--its def. gonna mess up the good thing we got going now.  For starters, they are taking away our ability to have an FSA--and we use that to pay our deductibles and such.  I'm going to start my own savings account to help pay for the big items--hopefully they won't find a way to keep me from doing that!

I do know that chemo causes these numbers to flucuate a little, so the docs don't worry too much unless something is really out of whack.  I hope you can get out and do something fun this week!  Our weather is going to be beautiful the next few days, and I plan on being outside enjoying it as much as I can!",

Kittycat-->Very nice pic!  Hope all goes well at work (and you're well rested!). Sherry-->Yes!  Stay here!  I had a bumpy, itchy little rash at the base of my thumb, and then a few days later some pimple looking bumps (sort of spread out--not touching each other) on the inside of my elbow.  Both cleared up with cortisone cream.  Weird!  I think it's our compromised immune system--lets these things crop up. Not only will it take 6-12 months to physically feel \"normal\" after tx, but it can take that long to emotionally be well.  Our friends and loved ones will expect us to be back to normal as soon as we are done with tx, but how can we be after all we've been through?  Many suffer more depression after tx, than during it!  It helped me a lot to be aware of this (I read many blogs of survivors, and saw what they went through) and not expect to be normal right away.  Give yourselves a chance to heal, and process all you've been through, and find someone to talk to, if needed!  And come here to share with others who know what you're talking about!

Sherry-->glad you were able to get tx, but I certainly understand the mixed feelings!  I hope the shot doesn't give you too much trouble.  I only get a little pain in my spine about a week after getting the shot.  I think you start the claritan the morning of, and take it for a couple of days.  I've also heard that taking Aleve with it works best.  Last year I had to get nuepogen shots, and they caused me a lot of pain.  I alternated ibuprofen and tylenol throughout the day and that helped me.  Your nurses might have some good ideas too.  We are all here cheering you on as you go through this chemo.  Soon you will be done too! Beau--> Tell your onc and nurses about your reaction to the Decadron.  I can only imagine how awful that felt without having the chemo to balance it out!  Hopefully that won't happen again, but if it does, maybe your doc can tell you what to do.  Maybe they can give you an infusion of Ativan or something.  The \"crash\" usually happens when the steroid is out of your body and you feel very fatigued and sleep alot.  That is my day today!  Last 2 days had the \"buzz\" and today is the \"crash\"!  At least its only one day for me with the Taxol. JFV--> Hope your day gets better :) I know I won't be leaving this thread!  Many of us have a lot to go through still--I have 6 weeks of rads, Herceptin until next Aug., and maybe recon next summer.  Besides, the \"after tx\" time can be difficult too, and we'll need each other to get through that.  And hopefully there will be more good times in our futures that we can share too!!",

It went from 65 to 59 after AC to 51 now (for those of you who know what the numbers mean).  Onc is going to put me on some blood pressure medicine, at a very low dose, and that is supposed to help.  If it doesn't, he said there are other things to try before we stop the Herceptin.  Now I have to watch for shortness of breath (seriously?  Does he know how out of shape I am now?), swelling ankles, and from the medicine I have to watch for light-headedness.  My Potassium is already a little high and the med can make it worse, so I have to have that tested weekly.  I somehow knew this wouldn't go smoothly for me. Oh well, it's not that bad. Also, because my clavicle area is so fried from rads we are going to do the 5 boosts now, and finish the rest after the boosts are done.  That will give that area time to heal.  The rest of the chest/armpit area is bright pink, but is holding up pretty well.

I finished rads today!!!  Yay!!  I brought in a big bowl of fresh fruit, and some homemade goodies,and I got lots of hugs.  Last year when I finished I told them I never wanted to see them again, and this year they told me that!!  I am very thankful I had such a wonderful team there.  And I shed a few tears once I got to the car! My hair feels like a really soft plush blanket.  It's starting to show some color (not sure whatt color yet tho).  My eyelashes are long enough to wear mascara, and my eyebrows are back too.  Seems I have hair EVERYWHERE now--like an overabundance!  I guess I always was a hairy person, it's just so light you can't really see it :) I am sooo tired lately (from rads).  Tomorrow will be the last day my daughter works, so it will be the last time she'll need me to watch my grandson.  I'll have him 3 days total this week.  That, plus rads, plus Christmas shopping are really wearing me out.  So, I plan on a few days of taking it easy!  My youngest will be home from college Sunday--can't wait to have her home!! Hope you all are staying warm, and taking time to enjoy the sights and sounds of the season!",

Take your demerol as prescribed, please don't be afraid to use it for the pain.  I take percocet for my pain from the Taxol.  Get something stronger if it doesn't work.

We sure have come a loooong way since last June!  I am SO PROUD of all my June gals--you ladies are AMAZING! latte--my rads onc gave me a break for a few days when my skin got real bad.  The clavicle area was especially bad, so he gave that area a break by doing my boosts a few days early, then finishing the regular rads after the boosts. My scar area peeled, and is now soft and pink, and the whole area healed great with very little soreness. Cheyenna--thinking about you!! I had another Herceptin infusion today (#13, I think).  My heart function has increased from the bp med I'm on, so it seems to be working, and I haven't had to miss any Herceptin infusions!  I will have my last one Aug 10. I will have a mammo and mri in April for the bc, and a ct scan and another MUGA Feb. 21st.  The ct scan is for the colon cancer.  Onc wants me to have them every 6 months for awhile.  He said I'm young and if any cancer comes back he wants to catch it as early as possible.  But then he said because we were so aggressive with treatment, he doesn't think I have to worry about it coming back :) After the bc tests in April, I won't need another mammo or mri for a year. The best news is I won't need another colonoscopy for 2 more years (3 years from last one) Hope everyone is having a great day!  Stay warm and safe!!",

I took a big step today and informed my school district and principal that I would like to extend my leave until the end of the year.  I stopped in to the school today to visit and everyone thought it was a good idea.  I won't be able to do recess until it warms up in March, and with the fatigue and heart issue, working would be difficult.  I know many women really want to get back to work because it helps them move on and feel normal (and I respect that greatly!), but I just want some time to heal and enjoy life a little.  I plan on going back next Fall, but I will be thinking about what I really want to do with my life and sort of re-evaluating things.  My oncologist and family all think it's a good idea.  My onc said he will support me in anyway he can by filling out forms or writing a letter. Have a great Monday!! Tina",

(18 months)  My dd and youngest dd will go back to the Ukraine on the 9th to bring my newest gs home. Her hubby is staying home this trip to work and care for his son. I'll babysit during the day.  On the 14th my new gs will be home!  Can't wait to meet him! My eyelashes have thinned quite a bit and are very short and stubby!  My eyebrows, leg hair, and armpit hair all stopped growing for a few weeks, but now things are picking up again.  Hopefully the eyelashes will grow quickly!  The hair on my head is really thick on top, and a little curly.  It's shorter at the temples, but almost covering my ears.  I might go in and get a trim.  Lots of people really seem to like it short.  it's very easy to care for--just a little shaping cream to tame down the waves. One year ago today I got the call from my primary doc that the biopsy found cancer. It showed DCIS with a micro-invasion.  The lumpectomy found a 3.5 cm IDC tumor, and the mx found more DCIS all through the breast!  That all seems so long ago! Sherry--those little ones sound cute!  Hope you are still feeling better! Sorry about the LE--stay on top of it!  Why are you waiting until the 21st? Do they know that there have been changes in your arm size?  Usually they want to get started on that asap! Dmom--It is so sad to hear of another loss--thinking of you! Oh crap!  now I forgot everything else I was going to say!  Chemo brain is definitely a problem for me!  Well, it's good to see that many of you are still checking in.  I think of you all often. As for the trip next Spring--sounds like fun, but I won't be able to make it.  I'm saving up for a big trip with my hubby.  He and I would like to start traveling a bit more--maybe go on one of those Alaskan cruises. love ya!

Kitty-hope you get your answers soon. And relief from the pain. Don't know who else I am missing--I can hardly remember what I just read!  My gs is sleeping, so I finally have time to catch up a bit--but I'm so tired!  He is doing well, and we are having fun, but there are times he really misses his parents.  Then I feel sad for him.  We were able to skype with his mom (my dd) earlier today, and he's not too sure what to think of that.  He was a little sad for awhile after.  His aunt is going to take him for awhile tomorrow, so I can get my Herceptin. Have a good evening everyone!",

Tomorrow morning my youngest and oldest DDs are leaving to go to the Ukraine to bring home my new grandson, Charles Gabriel. They will be home late next Thursday.  I will have my little buddy here all week during the day while his dad is at work.  I'm not sure he is going to like having a brother at first, but like any sibling, he'll grow to love him eventually.  I'll get to meet Charlie either Fri. or Sat.  Can't wait!

See how it goes the first round--I found it helped me to plan out food and activities (select funny vids to watch, music to listen to, etc.) ahead of time so I didn't have to think about much during those few bad days.  If I didn't plan it out I'd lay in bed and not know what to do or eat! Most likely you will have some fatigue, but probably not as bad as I had it--just want you to be prepared just in case!  Chew on ice while you are getting the Adriamycin, its supposed to help prevent mouth sores, also rinse your mouth with baking soda and water.  Your chemo nurse will probably tell you all this too.  I used baking soda toothpaste (instead of rinsing)and that seemed to help. Another thing you will probably be told is you have to drink LOTS of water after getting the cytoxin.  I think my nurse told me I should be peeing every hour!  Have a variety of liquids on hand, it might be hard to find something that tastes good.  I liked tart drinks, like orange juice and pink lemonade.  Also kool aid. Well, that's probably more than you wanted to know!  I hope some others will jump in here and tell you what worked for them! God is Good--all the time!!",

I had my 2nd taxol and Herceptin today.  Loooong day!  7 hours we were there.  I got a new scrip for more percocet to take for the pain.  Onc told me the pain is usually worse with the dd Taxol.  Onc nurse hadn't heard of using ice on nails, and I told her I didn't really want to mess with that anyway.  She said she was going to read up on it.  Neuropathy is a little worse, and the onc expected that.  My hemoglobin is finally starting to creep back up.  It was 10.2 today--up from 9.9 last time--I think it was 9.2 before that.  Platelets were fine too, so I can take ibuprofen, if needed. The benedryl hit me hard today!  Very woozy and a little nausea--like motion sickness.  Nurse said next time we will slow down the drip, even though I'll only be getting 1/2 the dose.  Only 2 more to go--this time I'm praying I'll NEVER have to have chemo again!!",

If its a shorter time than that, you can get a neupogen shot--actually its usually a series of 3 shots, 3 days in a row.  Both can give you bone pain, but its usually managed well with otc drugs.

If your neuropathy is really bothering you, then maybe you should skip the last tx, because, as I said, it will get worse before it gets better.  It's really up to you, and how you feel about the neuropathy, and finishing tx!  Good luck with your decision!!

I have had a port for over a year now (was treated for colon cancer last year).  Ask to get a \"power\" or \"smart\" port.  Then it can be used for ct scans and such.  It really saves the veins!  I don't even notice mine anymore, didn't take me long to get used to it.  I was given some \"happy\" drugs before surgery, and stayed awake for the whole procedure--altho I've heard some sleep through it.  Didn't hurt at all, but was sore for a few days.  Get a prescription for Emla cream.  Put it on the port an hour before and cover it with Glad Press n Seal to keep it off your clothes.  It makes a big difference--if I remember to use it I don't feel a thing when they access it.  Otherwise its a about the same as an iv stick--hurts a bit, but only for a min.  Some people don't feel anything after using it a few times, but I still do, (if I forget the cream).  I know a lady who has had hers in for 9 years now! I'll be waiting to hear how everyone handles the hair loss!  I'm not looking forward to it!  the first thing I told my onc when I found out the cancer spread to my nodes was \"after all I've bee through I still have to lose my hair!\"  It only thinned during my previous chemo. The cancer center I go to does chemo classes before starting chemo.  Its a good time to ask the nurse a lot of q's about side effects, because sometimes they know more than the docs!  One of my nurses had breast cancer a few years ago, so she'll be a big help. Here is a good website about chemo side effects:  www.chemocare.com I will get nausea meds in my IV before starting chemo (last time it was Zofran and Decadron, and an Emend pill), then I had a scrip for Zofran, Decadron, Compazine and Ativan at home.  Some of those were added after a few rounds. Everyone responds differently, but just know that if you have nausea there are different meds you can try.  If you get a scrip for Decadron (or generic dexamethasone) take it EXACTLY as directed--it is a steroid and will keep you up at night.  I once  took it for several days and was only supposed to take it for 3 days post chemo--lots of sleepless nights! Tell your docs EVERYTHING!  You'll be surprised at what they can help with. Let the fun begin! T.",

If you have ANY changes in bowel habits or blood in the stool then get one done regardless of age.  I was 45 when my tumor was found--I put off talking to my doc about it for 18 months, assuming it was IBS or colitis. If those of you that are younger have changes in bowel habits, don't let your doc assume it is something else due to your age.  Insist on getting a colonoscopy.  There are too many stories of people in their 20's and 30's who found the colon cancer too late because their docs thought they were too young.  Feel free to PM me with any questions or concerns!",

Some thoughts on anti-nausea meds--> I remember reading that some insurance companies wouldn't pay for Zofran (ondansetron) and Emend.  Often the ins. co makes you try less expensive drugs first, but if they don't work, they will allow the more expensive drugs.  My ins co sends me the expensive drugs from their own pharmacy. Also, for those that have morning nausea, or are vomiting, Zofran has a \"melt in your mouth\" pill that you can ask your doc for.  Again, due to cost, the docs don't usually prescribe it at first. I keep the pills at my bedside and take them first thing in the am--no water needed, they are berry flavored and just dissolve in your mouth.  I just looked at the box and they are called \"Ondansetron Orally Disintegrating Tablets\".  You take them 2x/day instead of 3x/day.  I'm grateful to my home nurse for mentioning them last year!

Mine is down to 9,6 and my onc said that could be contributing my tiredness that doesn't go away.  I've been telling everyone (docs, nurses, friends, etc) that the difference between this and my last chemo is that when I came out of the \"fog\" before, I felt really good--it was like I was on a high.  I was thrilled and excited about everything and had more energy.  With the AC I don't have any \"good\" days.  I have \"ok\" days where I can do what's necessary--shopping, church, etc--but barely!  I'm not out of the house long before I need to go back home and rest! grneyd5600-->wow!  bummer about your arm!  yes, please make sure you are doing everything your surgeon tells you--mine has a physical therapist that I would see if I had any swelling.  They can  do certain massages that help, and also fit for the sleeve.  I was told that working large muscles, like the thighs and butt help move fluid through the nodes all throughout the body--but you don't want to do that if the fluid is infected! Sherry--> much relieved to hear that you are feeling better--see? if you take those meds you really don't have to suffer as much.  Its a good testimony to others who might want to try to \"tough it out\"  (not that that's what you were doing!) Jenweg-->yes!  ask for a power port.  You will get a card or something to carry with you to let other's know that's what you have.  Then if you need a CT scan or other test they can use the port instead of you veins--it works great for that! RS711--> my nurse just told me today that my hair should start growing back as soon as I'm done with Taxol, but while still getting Herceptin.  I think I've read on some other threads here that sometimes it grows in slower while on Herceptin, but that doesn't happen to everyone. I found out today that since my neuropathy hasn't gotten better, I will be getting DD Taxol--that's every 2 weeks.  It will take 3 hours--actually a little longer the first time cause they give it slower.  I will get benedryl first--sounds like a big dose.  Plus, the Herceptin the first time takes longer too, so she switched my appt. to 8:30, because it will take most of the day.  She said instead of zofran, emend and decadron, I might get a compazine pill, and bag of decadron, then compazine at home.  There isn't as much nausea with the the Taxol.  She (my nurse Andrea) said that is the standard, but since I have had more nausea--even on my chemo last year, my onc might give me something more.  Then she said that there might be a little more nausea with the dd taxol too.  So, bottom line, we'll wait and see what the onc orders--I'm sure I can ask for zofran, or whatever I decide I would like to keep taking. I will also start weekly Herceptin at the same time as the Taxol. oh--I get a 4 week break!  I was going to wait 3 weeks to move dd to college, but the onc is gone that week so he said 4 weeks would be ok!  PARTY!   I told him I trust him to know what's best!  So I'll be starting taxol and herceptin on Aug. 23rd.  The week before I'll have another MUGA scan, an ekg, and finally meet with the radiation doc to see if I have to have that or not.  I had radiation last year for my colon cancer and had an AWEFUL time (and its the gift that keeps on giving!). I told the doc that I NEVER wanted to see him again (altho he is a great doc, and his nurse helped me through MANY problems)!! ok--I'm going on the steroid buzz now, so should probably stop yapping!  I talked to my oldest for an hour on the phone, then went out ot the garage and talked my hubby's ear off--all of a sudden he decided he REALLY NEEDED to finish mowing the lawn--I think it was so he could put his ear plugs ion and give them a rest! Lol!! Take Care ladies!  You will ALL be in my prayers tonight when I'm NOT sleeping!!

Did he say how the se's are different (between weekly and e/o week)?  I'm doing taxol every 2 weeks x 4 (and I do have to have the shot the next day, as do some others).  I was supposed to do weekly, but because of my neuropathy, the 2 week cycle is better.  Just wondering!  :)  Let us know how the first infusion goes!  Its supposed to be a long one!

I wanted to mention to those using a port for the first time--I forgot about the taste.  Some people can taste the saline flush, and some people it really bothers.  I never threw up with my other chemo, but felt nauseous alot, and the saline would set off that yucky feeling.  If I hold my nose I can't taste it.  Don't have to hold my breath, just plug my nose.  Some people bring a tea bag and smell that while getting the flush--I found it easier to plug my nose.  After several rounds of chemo I started getting sick from the alchol wipe they use on the port before accessing it--I had started to associate that smell with chemo.  Luckily it has faded now--for awhile I couldn't stand anything that smelled like alcohol!  But I supposed it will all come back to me...

Continue trying to get through to your onc.  I'm sure there is something he/she can do for you.  Or you could try your primary physician too.  My cancer center also has counselors we can talk to--have you tried that yet?  Maybe talking this through with a professional would help. Think of some things that make you happy--is there a favorite place you can visit?  A night out at a play or comedy club?  A girls weekend away?  I plan on getting out to some lunches next week before I start chemo again.  Also, reading Psalms really helps me alot.

Got my 2nd AC today.  My port wasn't working for the blood draw so they put some \"draino\" type stuff in that eats away the protein that can build up in there. That's happened to me before.  Worked fine after sitting in there for awhile. While that was doing its job, the nurse drew blood from my arm to do labs.  All my labs were great!  Told the onc about my pain a week after getting my Neulasta shot, and he confirmed that my neutrophils (wbc) were probably low at that time and the shot was doing its job!  I also asked him about vit B6 and glutamine, as I have neuropathy still from last chemo.  He said it wouldn't hurt...the studies aren't finished yet, so don't really know if it'll work.  I think I'll try them both.  My onc did test my B12 levels recently, and they were fine.  He seems to think this means I really don't need the B6, but like he said, it won't hurt anything. When I got there today, I was already feeling nauseated--started on the ride there (anticipatory nausea the onc called it).  I remembered I had an Ativan in my purse. I asked the nurse if I should take it and she said absolutely!  We talked about what a wonder drug it is!  I told the onc I had taken one, and he said I should take it everytime I come.  One thing I forgot--my Emla cream for the port--ouch!  Thankfully it only hurts for a minute.  The arm stick hurt a lot less. I asked for, and got, the orally disintigrating Zofran tablets.  I like them a lot better for the mornings. Other than that, just generally feel crappy!  But not too bad.  I'm waterlogged, and I'm eating some yummy cherries--trying to load up on fruit to help keep the bowels moving.  I will take a Senekot tonight for sure.

Sounds like you've been busy!  Let's hope you can stay out of the OR for awhile! Keep crackers handy, and don't let your tummy get hungry--nausea is worse then.  I keep applesauce cups on hand to eat in the am before I even get out of bed so I can take my pills right away (don't like to take pills on an empty stomach!).  I assume you've been told to drink lots of liquids?  And that you'll be peeing red for a few days?  Let you onc or the onc nurses know about any bad se's you have--they can help with almost anything. I'm hoping and praying we won't have any of the bad side effects!  I'll be thinking of you and Roosje tomorrow and hoping to hear from you both soon after! Take care!

I didn't start to black out in the shower like yesterday, but did feel woozy and laid down quickly in front of the fan.  The nurse wanted me to come to the ER, she was worried about heart trouble.  That moved me to the front of the line, and I got in quickly.  They did the usual vitals, ekg, chest x-ray and blood work up.  There was a lull where we didn't see anyone for about 2 hours.  We found out that my wbc's were so low that the lab was running them again, and getting something called a \"differential\".  Not sure which wbc number they were looking at exactly, but something shouldn't go below 200, and mine was 12.  Also, once when they took my blood pressure it was lower than its ever been, and my pulse was really slow, but the tech said it was strong, so he wasn't too worried.  So, after all that, the ER doc wanted to talk with an oncologist to see what to do.  Mine was unavailable, but his partner was on call.  He said it was ok for me to go home, if I felt ok, and watch for fever/infection.  I will talk to my onc. the morning.  Of course I am to go back if I pass out, or gt a fever over 100.4.  Don't know what is causing the light-headedness; we'll see what they say tomorrow. I feel better after having gone in, because my heart is ok, and that's what I was worried about.  I have a family history of heart disease, and I hate being on Adriamycin because of that (among other things!!).  I will take it easy tonight, and see what happens tomorrow! On another note...my DH cut my hair really short today (it is coming out by the handful!), and buzzed the back of it.  It was kinda fun--although he was real nervous at first!  Left it spiky, and even had a \"faux hawk\"!  I wore a scarf to the hospital, because its still falling out all over.  The scarf has a little hat attached underneath.  So it was my first day out in a scarf! Boy, we sure are the bunch with the tough se's!  Glad we have each other to talk to!!  Hope EVERYONE is feeling better tonight and tomorrow! Take care ladies! Tina",

My onc. nurses give me a cup of ice chips to chew on when they are giving me the Adriamycin.  I haven't had bad mouth sores, but the inside of my mouth starts to feel chewed up and rough about a week after chemo.  I haven't had the \"burned tongue\" feeling--so maybe it helps? Is there a cafe where you are? May you can get a cup of crushed ice?  Or fill a big insulated cup with ice chips--maybe some of them won't melt before chemo? ~T",

I finished chemo about 5 weeks ago, and I am noticing that I am starting to get sore again.  I just hope it doesn't get as bad as last time.  I'm not sure what causes it, but I've heard others complain of this too.  Maybe the scan will show inflammation or something.  Don't worry though!  Hopefully it will show what's causing it so you can get help! ",

Sugar is used in Pet scans because the cancer cells take it in, and then it can be seen on the scan.  Sugar is still bad for you, for many reasons, but at least I don't have to worry about it feeding my cancer (just my belly :P )!",

I've read that some are getting the herceptin and taxol separately--I'm getting mine on the same day, but was told it will be a very long day.  The next infusions won't take as long as the first one.  The week in between the taxol txs I'll get herceptin alone, and that will only take a half an hour. Anyone had radiation beforechemo?  I don't know if that ever happens, but I wanted to give you some info, just in case.  Or in case you have to have chemo again someday after rads.  I've been having problems with the skin on my \"bum\" from the radiation I had last year (colon cancer).  The area is super red and sore.  Yesterday I had to take percocet throughout the day because the pain was unbearable.  I had a similar (but not as bad) problem last winter while on chemo, and my onc mentioned something called \"radiation recall\".  Apparently chemo can \"recall\" the skin reactions that were casued by radiation--and I had a lot of problems with rads last year!  I did a little searching online (not really expecting to find anything), and Adriamycin and Taxol both seem to cause this recall more than other chemos!  Great!  A couple of articles mentioned that steroids might help, and that makes sense because I always hurt the worst the 2nd week of my cycle--the first few days I take Decadron.  So, I put in a call to my oncs office and we'll see what he says and if he'll give me some steroids.    Just thought I'd share that info with you. I'm not sure if I'll be able to make the 8 hour drive to KC on Sunday.  I'm too weak to help much with moving all my dd's stuff up to her 3rd floor room anyway.  I'm thinking of asking my other dd to go with instead...we'll see....Can anyone say CANCER SUCKS?  Thank you :) Love Tina",

Charlie (my newest gs) has a lot of medical appointments ahead of him, and eventually heart surgery, but now he is doing well, and learning the language.  He picks up on things very quickly!  Yesterday he wouldn't eat his applesauce and my dd figured out it was because it was in the little plastic container, but his brother was eating from a cereal bowl.  When she put the applesauce in a bowl, he ate it right up! Dmom--I think my blood pressure medicine might be one of those bad ones.  It's Enalapril.  But I'm not going to worry about it because I will only be on it until I am done with herceptin in Aug.  I don't have high blood pressure, I take it because my heart function decreased from the Herceptin and this medicine brought it back up.  Is it ironic that I'm taking it because of breast cancer?  Geez! Chey--you sound wonderful, little sister!  Did you ever think you'd get through all this and be able to help someone else through it?  You have such a big heart.  You are going through so much, but still worry about others!

That was so wrong of him to say that.  What was he thinking?  He should definitely know better--or he shouldn't be a radiologist!  I'd love to go back and tell him what dx I ended up with!

I've been having a lot of pain still from Taxol.  Ibuprofen doesn't touch it, so I've been taking percocet.  This morning I felt pretty good, and didn't need any pain meds, but by early afternoon it was really bad.  I took 1 percocet, then an hour later took another half of one.  I feel pretty good now, just a little achy.  I have to say that overall this chemo is MUCH better than the AC, or even the FOLFOX I had last year.  I have no nausea, and only 1 day where I felt tired all day (so far anyway).  I'm hoping the pain goes away soon, and I have some good days before the next round!",

Carrol--> That is a tough decision. Most of us that had AC had to have the shot the day after.  With the chemo I had last year (a combo called FOLFOX) the onc waited to see if the wbc dropped before giving me a shot.  I did have chemo delayed several times due to low wbc counts, (and once due to low platelets, but that's different).  I just learned to roll with it, and not plan anything! Keep in mind that even with the neulasta, your wbc can drop very low, but it comes back up quicker, so if you do get some bad germs, your body will be able to fight it--but it might be a few days later.  Mine once dropped to almost nothing, but a week later they were back up higher than normal (because of the shot).  I only had them checked that one time in between because I had a fever and chest congestion.  I'm assuming mine drop low every time--about a week after chemo, so I'm always more careful at that time.  The weird part is you never know for sure how low they get, unless the onc has a reason to check.  How are you doing Bon? And, yes, where is Sherry?",

I hope you can get some much needed r&r soon!  That's a bummer you are already having trouble with rads!  I had a lot of trouble last year, and my doc said this would be nothing like that--should be no problem at all--yeah, I'll believe that when it happens! :P Thinking of you all!

Kitty--let us know how the speech went--proud of you for doing it!  My pastor wanted me to speak at church the Sunday after Christmas.  He was speaking about how each day is a new day (God's mercies are new every morning).  He knows that cancer has made me see each day as a gift from God, and wanted me to share that with the congregation.  I told him I couldn't do it yet--speaking in front of people is just too stressful for me!  I just finished rads, and needed to get through the holidays and didn't need any more stress right now. But I hope to share some of my insights some day--maybe after the chemo brain has faded a bit! Dmom--hope all is going well with you--did your streets ever get plowed? Chey--remember we are here for you in the good and the bad!  You have a whole new year stretched out before you--praying that your mood improves and you can enjoy it!  Please keep checking in---wish there was something I could do to help... Hope you are staying warm and dry where you are. Hope those that are doing rads right now are doing ok.  I didn't have too much trouble with it, thanks to my rads onc giving me breaks and such.  Skin got nice and red, and a little itchy, but never painful.  I finished on 12/15, and it's still peeling around the scar, but most of it has faded to a tan. My hair is about a 1/4 of an inch.  Coming in gray and thick. A little longer and I might start going \"topless\". Eyelashes are still growing--they came in quickly, as did my eyebrows.  I have a lot of facial hair now (thankfully very light colored!).  That happened to me after chemo last year too, and finally most of the facial hair went away on its own--hope that happens this time too! :P Looking forward to tomorrow. I've had a nice week with my hubby, but it's time for him to go back to work so I can get something done.  I'm glad I made the decision to wait until next Fall to go back to work, but I have a lot of things I want to get done, and I don't want to get lazy and waste my days.  I told my dh that we should go on a little trip soon--maybe Branson, or someplace else within a days drive.  I need to get out and have some fun!! Take care everyone--you are all in my thoughts and prayers!",

I saw my gyno today--she hasn't seen me since before I was first dx with colon cancer, so we had lots to talk about!  I have some problems in \"that\" area from the colon radiation, so I have to have an ultrasound next week.  Then, depending on how everything looks, we might discuss having the ovaries removed.  I'm not sure this is necessary though, because I am not er+.  She did mention that she might refer me to a gyn-onc, depending on how everything looks.  We talked about testing for menopause. She said that isn't a very reliable test, but we might do it anyway because while it can't always tell if you are in permanent menopause, it can show if you aren't.  I've been menopausal since I had chemo and radiation a year and a half ago.  Anyway, the ultrasound will tell us more of what's going on with the uterus lining and ovaries (I had a cyst there a few years ago). So, add another test to my list of many upcoming tests!  Also I heard the dreaded line today \"because of your history...\" meaning we have to do every test possible to make sure you don't have any more cancer! Thoughts?  Comments? We aren't posting as much here these days, but any of you that are still going through rads, or whatever--we are still here for you!  And those that are finished--it's nice to hear what you are up to these days and how you are feeling too. One more thing--did any of you gals have one of the \"flap\" recons?  I've seen some pics and it made me more confused than ever.  They just don't look real(sorry--not trying to offend anyone!)--I don't know what I was expecting!  on the other hand, it would be nice to wear swimsuits, and not have to worry about whether my shirt is too low cut all the time.  The scars from the mx are so visible if I even slightly bend over.  I just am having a REALLY hard time deciding about recon!  Any thoughts are appreciated!

Bon--I see your signature says Herceptin X 18.  Is that a full year?  Have you had it every 3 weeks since the beginning?  I started it weekly then switched to every 3 weeks.  I just had #15, and I won't be done until Aug.  How are you doing on it?  any SEs?  I just get tired for a few days, but nothing like chemo.",

My primary doc didn't want me taking melatonin because it doesn't always mix well with other meds.  She was concerned about the Herceptin.  I had asked her about it because the bottle says not to use with endocrine or autoimmune problems, and I have an underactive thyroid, which is both. I told her I was looking for something that I didn't have to worry about getting addicted too, and she gave me Trazadol.  It's an anti-depressant, but is also used for sleeping.  She said I can use it as often as I want.  She started me on a small dose and explained how I can increase it if needed.  I only used it once, and I was a little groggy the next day, but the doc said that would go away as I continued using it. Had another Herceptin infusion today, and it has made me more tired than usual. And my tummy is kind of yucky too.  I'm so glad I only have 2 left!  Aug. 15th is my last one.  Tomorrow is going to be very hot, and my youngest has the day off, so we are going to stay in out of the heat and watch movies!  Just what the dr. ordered! ",

Colon cancer is generally slow growing, so 5 or 10 years is not unreasonable.  The important thing is that you get your colonoscopy at 50, if you have no bowel problems, or EARLIER if you have ANY changes in bowel habits.  Blood, mucus, frequency, narrow stools, etc.  I was 44 when dx, thank God my gp recommended a colonoscopy, I was already stage 3b.  Many docs don't--you have to push for it.  And that concludes my public service announcement....",

Other concerns--the big dent in my chest that is hard to keep covered.  Even if I wear a cami under my shirts, if I bend over even slightly, I feel like everyone can not only see the \"dent\", but the whole ugly scar (I call it a \"half an A\" cup, because the bs left a lot of skin behind in case I do recon).  So, I hope to hear from some others so I know I'm not alone in this!  Lets share problems, and solutions!

As for drinking lots of liquids, the cytoxin can cause bladder problems if you don't get it flushed out (hopefully your onc or nurse will tell you this).  My nurse told me I should be peeing every hour--even through the first night.  You'll be awake anyways from the steroids :) The hair comes out about 2 weeks after the first tx.  I cut mine short--had fun trying a new haircut.  I've worn scarves--hated the wigs.  I finished taxol in Oct. and I now have enough hair that I could go without a scarf if it was warm enough!  My head gets cold really easy!

Thundershowers--I understsnd why you are so upset--it's good you went with your gut and had the surgery!  BC is generally slow-growing though, and the dx probably wouldn't have been any different, but you don't know how many more cancer cells escaped and travelled throughout your body during that time.  Let's hope the chemo got them all!! From what I have heard, if cancer is in the nodes it is automatic chemo.  There is no way of knowing where the cancer cells have travelled, so we have to poison the whole system in hopes we get it all.  You can always refuse chemo, but that would be taking a big risk.  As for rads, I had 3 nodes and it was a \"gray\" area (4 nodes is a definite), but my RO thought there was enough reason to do the rads.   Since this was my 2nd cancer in a little over a year, and I'm only in my mid 40s, both my RO and MO wanted to hit me with everything they had.  There are SEs I'll have forever from it all, but hopefully no more cancer!!",

Starting about the 3rd day, I had about 5 days of hardly getting out of bed--total brain fog.  Then I felt a little better before the next round, but never fully recovered. I did, thankfully, recover fairly quickly after I was all done.  I then went on to Taxol, which caused a lot of pain, but Percocet took care of that.  Hopefully you will be one of the ones that gets through easily!  Exercise helps too! Good luck!",

Anyways--all this to say that I appreciate reading everyone's thoughts and experiences!",
