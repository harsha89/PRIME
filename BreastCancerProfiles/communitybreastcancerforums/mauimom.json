Since then, the pain isn't too bad but I feel like I tire easily and can tell if I overdo it and will need to rest up. Basically, I've been trying to do more each day but there have been some days that are frustrating. With three little ones, I have to consciously hold back a lot. I agree that the TE is uncomfortable since it was filled during surgery. I don't have my next until the beginning of the month thankfully. Keep us posted and hope the healing is progressing!",
