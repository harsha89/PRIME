She also said weather can cause achiness.  She recommends stretching and taught me some massages to the scar areas.  I don't have any swelling--and I exercise & stretch like crazy--so I'm fairly convinced its not LE.  But like so many of us--I keep a close eye on it.  Did you get your sleeve and glove--any relief?  Erin",

This leads women who take Tamoxifen to experience many of the same benefits and side effects as women who undergo estrogen replacement therapy. This can include irregular periods, early menopause, weight gain/loss, etc.  Don't despair you will feel better with time.  Hugs from Atlanta! Erin ",
