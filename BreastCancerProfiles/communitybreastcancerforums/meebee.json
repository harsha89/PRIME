Results came back with BIRAD 0. \"Although left axillary ultrasound appears benign, for an area of persistant increased density in the left axillary tail that does not have the typical appearance of a lymph node. MRI is characterization is still recommended. \" The health ins. company did not approve the MRI. Asked me to see a surgeon instead to do a biopsy. My questions are: 1. Going from \"recommended MRI\" to biopsy sounds serious. Is the findings so bad that it warrants a biopsy? I am freaking out. 2. How do you perform biopsy on an area of density that did not show up in the US?Will a hallow needle do the trick?  3. Should I just pay for an MRI first to see anything shows up? 4. I set an appointment with a surgeon and INITIAL consult wouldn't be till two weeks' time. Seems like it will be a long time before I can finally get a biopsy. Should I look for some one sooner ? 5. Is there such a place where you can just walk in with you films and report and get a biopsy there and then? Sorry for long post. I am lost and looking for some advices. Thanks.   Log in to post a reply",
