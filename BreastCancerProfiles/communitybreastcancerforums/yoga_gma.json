Woke up that morning and knew something was terribly wrong and I was on the operating table by noon. I have an excellent retina specialist luckily. Been off work since then. Had oil bubble and buckle 1st surgery. Cataract surgery about a year later. Last (hopefully) surgery in Feb to remove oil bubble and replace with gas. Legally blind in that eye and vision hasn't improved. Doc says it may take 3 more months b4 he can see end result. Can't imagine what you've gone thru since I at least have my 'good' eye andit's still been difficult and scary. I appreciate the responses to my post. Spoke with my doc today. She says it'll be much quicker to get the needle biopsy done than to have a consult with a plastic surgeon then have to wait for a surgery date. So that's what I'll do for now. Will def move forward (if feasible) in having implants removed.",

      "Content": "yoga_gma wrote: I had a lumpectomy about 13 years ago. Benign. A couple of years later I had silicone implants. I have been very good about having mammos every year (maternal grandmother had BC with double mastectomy). Last week I was having severe pain in my right breast, went to urgent care and they sent me to the ER. Had an ultrasound that evening. Saw my GP the next day and she ordered a mammo. Had that yesterday and they sent me immediately down the hall for another ultrasound. My GP just called to say that they found a nodule on my left breast (the severe pain had been in my right breast) and that the implant has ruptured. She is ordering a needle biopsy and will put me in contact with a plastic surgeon. At this point, I just want the implants out but can't afford to unless my insurance covers it (I've been on disability for a detached retina since right around the time of my lay off). Does it make sense that they would choose to do a needle biopsy instead of removing the implants (since at least one of them is ruptured) and biopsying the nodule once it's out? Am I missing something? Log in to post a reply",
