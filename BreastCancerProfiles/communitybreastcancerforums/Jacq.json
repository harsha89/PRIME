      "Content": "Jacq wrote: Hi, I just posted in the IBC area, but I thought I would post here too.  My mother has just been preliminarily diagnosed (biopsy) with IBC.  She is 83 years old and has a moderate dementia as well.  She is fairly stable medically, but this is a huge issue for her.  We will be seeing the onc tomorrow.  We don't have the tumor markers etc. as yet.  The surgeon who did the biopsy was offering a mastectomy and arimidex before he was sure it was IBC but he suspected it may be.  From what I read about IBC it would be impossible to get any results from that.  Considering her age and other issues, I can't imagine anyone would recommend aggressive treatment for her.  She is living a limited but relatively comfortable life at home with my 85 yr old dad and a caregiver.  She eats well, gets physical therapy and is fairly responsive and speaks. We expected that at some point she would disappear into her dementia and that would be how she would eventually pass away.  This is a huge blow to me because now I think she will have an aggressive cancer that will race throughout her body and be painful for her.  It is extremely rare and aggressive.  How the heck did this happen all of a sudden?  I have never heard of anyone her age in all the research I have done over the last few days.  I am extremely discouraged. I am a stage 1 IDC survivor, almost 3 years NED, and have been around this site for a few years, mostly lurking lately.  I am freaked out because it's my mom. Thanks for listening...
