      "Content": "Janejones wrote: After having a breast reduction in April 2015, I noticed some weird lumps in my breast. After a few mammo/US exams done in 2016 & 2017, it was determined that these lumps/issues are stemming from fat necrosis from my previous surgery. This past Oct, I noticed a lump in my armpit. I went to my PCP, assuming it was not breast related. She did a full work up (blood work/labs) and everything was normal. She suggested I monitor it for changes and come back in 6 weeks. 6 weeks later, it was still there so she suggested I have a Mammo/US done. Those came back normal so she said give it another 2 weeks and come back. It\u2019s now been over 2 months and the lump is still there. I\u2019ve also started to notice neck/shoulder pain and sporadic breast pain on the same side as the lump. It feels sore, like overworked muscles. She suggested I see a breast surgeon to have a biopsy done. I have an appointment with a breast surgeon next week, so hopefully he will be able to give me some insight. I\u2019m not sure if he will want to do a biopsy, but after doing research online I\u2019m starting to worry. This axillary lump (as my PCP defines it) seems to be something that appears after BC has spread to the lymph nodes. Could it be possible that the radiologists missed this in my last few exams? Should I be concerned about the lump and the breast/neck/shoulder pain? I\u2019m 36 and at every screening they tell me I\u2019m either \u201ctoo young\u201d to have cancer or \u201cit\u2019s probably nothing\u201d since it doesn\u2019t run in my family. I understand that they are professionals, but I would hate to think that my scans weren\u2019t read thoroughly because of their assumptions. Has anyone else experienced this before?

They scanned both breasts along with the area where the lump is after they did my mammo During the scan, the tech called the radiologist in because she saw something. The radiologist scanned me as well and they both pointed things out w/technical terminology, but they didn\u2019t explain what was going on. She just confirmed I have the lump and said to wait for my doctor to receive the report. I wasn\u2019t alarmed, but I did leave feeling like my questions went unanswered.",
