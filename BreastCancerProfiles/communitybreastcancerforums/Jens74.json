Today is much better, but my taste buds have taken a vacation and my nose decides with the fridid Temps and dryness, it might as well start bleeding if I bend my head over clean white laundry!!! Sometimes I think someone must be laughing when they deal out these SE cards for the day!",

I just put A C number 3 in the books yesterday and I Have a tip for anyone struggling with the ice chips during A. They were contributing to the nauseous feeling I would get during the push. Try using lemon Italian ice! My nurse was done in 20 minutes instead of the 30 last time. Hope this helps some others out there!",

I went out and shopped a bit, rested and doing great. Definitely eat when I am hungry and graze the rest of the time. It helps to keep the energy right. Really, a good day so far! Happy New Year!!!",

I took the Zofran and it is helping but it makes my face seem a little tingling? Yesterday my feet started to have some sensitivity. All these strange and new sensations! Ugh! But, I was able or get up and get my daughter off to school. AND made an omelet for breakfast. Going to rest awhile before I try to get that exercise in! Have a great day everyone! We got this!",

I can't lie, I have been tired this evening! Today,I really noticed the decline in my taste buds and my throats feels a bit irritated. Tea with honey is helping that! I never should have mentioned the bone achiness yesterday! It started around 6 last night, but Tylenol certainly helped! All and all a good day! I know I can do this. The S/E are no longer so scary. And, I still have my hair, at least for another week, and much shorter than I would typically have it! I have been taking Senna S pretty regularly (Sorry! Couldn't help that one!) I haven't needed the nausea medicine since day 5. And, I am still eating well. Today was the first decline in my appetite, probably finally free of the steroid effect The port gets very irritated when I drive! I need to make a mini pillow for the seatbelt! I will soon be off to bed! I am so looking forward to sleep tonight! Have a wonderful evening! Jens",
