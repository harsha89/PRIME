Lashes are still not visible, but they were pretty lightly colored before this. For those of us without lashes but want to have the appearance of lashes, check out blogger Eyelineher. She has some great tutorial videos on how to apply eyeliner to make it look like you have lashes without using the fake ones.",

She told me kno underwire until the LE goes away, and no tight band under the bra. I found an Under Armour bra that has cups (another thing she wanted, not just a sports bra), but the band was a little too tight. I went to JoAnn fabrics and bought a bra extender. They make them with two, three or four eyelets so they work with most all bras. She used two tools on my scar tissues, and a machine called a Physio-Touch on my LE, along with massage, and kinesio tape. I really think the suction from the physio touch machine has made a big difference. It made the fluid move from my breast, down into my ribs, where it eventually moves to the groin lymph nodes and gets sent to the kidneys. I had to fly while my rib skin was swollen, so she had me wear a compression camisole, during the flights. I found a Spanx camisole and wore it. I had increased rib pain after flying, and can\u2019t imagine what it would have been like without it. I showed her my camisole afterward and she wanted it tighter, and suggested putting a washcloth under it. I tried that, but I think adding the cloth to the unaffected side would have helped compress the after side more. Hope this helps someone else",

Angie, my first Swell Spot was too big, so I ordered a smaller one. I still don\u2019t like it because I feel like it cuts off the circulation under my arm. Need to go look up Trental.",
