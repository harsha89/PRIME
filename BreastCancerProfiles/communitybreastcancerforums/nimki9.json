So bad that it hurts if I touch it or when I lay down. Has anyone else experienced this? I had switched to baby shampoo cause my nurse said it would be gentler. I don\u2019t even want to look in the mirror now because it\u2019s so bad. I also broke out on my face and chest but not as bad and those don\u2019t hurt like my head.",

On a positive note, I'm meeting with someone from an organization called Village Project that delivers 3 healthy, freezable meals a week to people and their famil going through chemo treatments for free. Which will be great because I've had zero desire to cook at all. ElizB - I see you are in Cleveland and so am I. Have you heard of them? They only deliver to a few suburbs on the west side so far. GA Warrior - Enjoy your trip,",

I think the worst side effect I had was the bone pain from the Neulasta and that got better by the end of the first week. My hair really started falling out these last two days so I did the shave this evening and I think it looks pretty good. Turns out my head is not as misshapen as I always believed. Im hoping round two goes as smoothly as round one. Fingers crossed",
