    "Content": "Hannah941 wrote: I have been to the doctors this morning for a checkup due to both breasts being quite sore they have always been quite big so last few weeks I've been putting it down to weight gain & breasts getting larger, they found a lump in my left breast. I have an appointment in 2 weeks for a mamogram and ultrasound, im age 23 and to my knowledge have no breast cancer that run in the family. I also have a 3 year old (doc asked if i had children, if my birth was normal & im unsure if it makes a difference whether i am a mam or not I also ended up having an emergency c-section) I'm absolutely petrified. Keep crying & just want the date to hurry up.. I don't know much about cancer or other problems that can occur in the breast but I'm literally praying this isn't life threatening nor serious. Just very scared and don't know where to turn. Log in to post a reply",
