I do have a question, my face is red and super broke out, is this normal? Or could be an allergic reaction? Any suggestions on how to relieve it? You guys are so awesome at sharing. I appreciate each and everyone of you. I keep saying that cancer is bestowed on the strongest and you ladies are the strongest! Warrior on!!!",

I had my first treatment this past Weds, fairly uneventful beside my mini meltdown, but I got it under control. It was just fear of the unknown and my port was still a little tender. I took a blanket, IPad (although the center provides movies), my lunch (treatment is 3 1/2 hours). Try not to stress, you will do great!! The diagnosis info provided under names is updated in your profile and then you make it public Best of luck!!! You got this!!!    ",

I will be on a cocktail of taxol and Herceptin for 12 weeks, then Herceptin for 9 months. I had my port placement on 10/28 and it is extremely tender and somewhat still painful. Is this normal or maybe it's just me, everything about this diagnosis has been very difficult. Thanks for all the suppor",

My port placement was the hardest part so far. It was so painful and I was bruised from necklace to my nipple area, so I kind of freaked out. I finally got my head screwed on straight and everything went smoothly. Now I am anticipating the side effects. I have my nausea meds, so I am ready. Hope everyone had a great day!! 1 down 11 more to go!!!",

Number 2 (10 more to go) for me tomorrow, I am having a little anxiety even though I promised myself I would not. I have a prescription for a wig, should I just go and get one? When should I expect my hair to really start coming out? I also am interested in Medical Marijuana. Is that something you have to ask for or is based on symptoms, that your Dr prescribes it? I leave in AZ, so I know they do dispense. Have a wonderful, chins up!!!!",

I told my husband I was getting a long blonde wig and changing my name to Bambi ðŸ˜Š Sleepless-chemo brain is real!!! The forgetfulness, sense of confusion, it's crazy. My family did not believe me when I told them there was such a thing, they are now convinced. Hope everyone has a great day!! Warrior on!!!",
