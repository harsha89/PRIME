I only know (somewhat) my mom's side...I don't have/haven't had anything to do with him since I was a little girl. I would think it might be helpful to know but then again, look at all the people in the world that are adopted or who don't know their family history for whatever reason....it just means that the docs may have to do a little more work to diagnose you, right? I hope and pray you get answers soon too.",

I have an appt with an oncologist next month about the genetic counseling. I have to meet with an oncologist first, then he refers me to the genetic counselor and she submits info to the insurance company to see if it would be approved and then we would go from there....I'm having second thoughts about it though. Not sure if I really want to do that now or not.",

I was told that I had several cysts at 9 o'clock and at several other areas around my breast. My GYN asked me to come back in three months to follow up. I went in last week to follow up. I had another ultrasound done. I still have those same 'cysts' although the larger one at 9 o'clock has changed a bit in size and shape (it's a tad bit smaller). But now I have something at 6 o'clock that has caused more concern. On the report, it's written as 'hypoechoic area'....and I'm going to a general surgeon tomorrow to discuss whether I need to have a biopsy or not. Could cancer have grown within that three months? It wasn't there in July...what should I expect? My GYN says this surgeon doesn't like to do needle biopsies--thinks they miss too many diagnosis'. I'm also being referred to the HEM/ONC department in our hospital for genetic counseling. My aunt (mom's sister) was diagnosed years ago with breast cancer at age 39. She's been cancer free for many years now. A few days after my mammogram, my sister (age 42) was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer, had a large part of her colon removed and is now undergoing chemotherapy. Log in to post a reply",
