I am only taking tylenol extra strength now as I broke out into hives from the pain meds or antibiotics I was on. My drains are producing less and less each day. Hopeful they come out soon. I would say night time is uncomfortable and I prefer sleeping sitting up. My chest feels heavy and stretched if I lie flat. I stick a pillow under my knees and 3 pillows behind my back. My arm is sore too from having lymph nodes removed. My incision is wrapped in a tenser type dressing and I will not have it removed until the end of this week. I have not seen the incision or implant and I am very nervous about seeing my PS on Friday. I am thankful to find support in this group and would love to hear your experiences. I can not shower until these drains are out, but yesterday I went to a salon to have my hair shampooed and blowdry. It was heavenly and they were very gentle and accomodating.",

I am already out of the hospital and starting the at home physio recommendations. I still have two drains. One from my lymph nodes and one from my mastectomy site. I am so glad this step is over, but now to wait for the results from the pathology report. I know exactly how all of you ladies awaiting surgery feel and just remember one thing \"We are always given enough strength for the next step\". I just kept repeating that over and over on my surgery day and again during this recovery process. I am wishing you all strength and courage as you wait and recover from your surgery.",

I will get my drains removed tomorrow as they have been at least 2 days producing less than 30cc. I will go to the breast clinic where I had my surgery to get them removed. I have an appointment with my PS on Friday which will be a week and a half after my surgery. I have been wrapped in a dressing that is tight like a tenser bandage and I will have it removed by my PS on Friday. I am so nervous. It is frustrating and does make me a bit mad too. I guess they know what is best. It just seems strange not to be checked over sooner.",

I had my dressings removed and everything looks great. My PS said it can't get any better. My BS agreed. I feel very blessed having both looking after me. I also got my pathology report back. No cancer found in my lymph nodes. Yay!! I am a little concerned that it was a Grade 3 cancer and the report said \"lymphovascular invasion present\" and \"areas of carcinoma with micropapillary features\". I have another appointment with MO mid October to discuss further treatment. Not sure what to expect. I ordered an Amoena mastectomy camisole bra. Wish it had come in when I still had my drains because it had pockets for them which would have been handy. My PS want me in a bra 24/7 so I am glad I have something comfortable. I also have a knix bra that I have been wearing. It is supportive and comfortable. I am glad everyone us keeping us updated. It is so nice to hear from you.",
