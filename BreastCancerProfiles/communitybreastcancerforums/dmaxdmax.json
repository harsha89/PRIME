When I was pregnant 10 years ago they did an ultrasound that looked like the snow on an old B&W TV.  At the same time, a friend at another IVF clinic had one that looked like something from Star Trek - perfect digital 3D where you could see everything but the freckles.  We were particularly surprised since we were at one of the best clinics in the US and assumed it would have the best state of the art equipment.  (it didn't matter - we had/have healthy twin girls!) Might there be a similar situation with current screening equipment?  I can't imagine that every MRI or Ultrasound or Mammogram is done with the same set of Gizmos. If we get a second opinion it would be helpful to know if they have the latest and greatest technology - or at least no worse than what was used for the first opinion. Any ideas?  Thanks!
