I am almost 60 and I went through the whole schmeil and I still have my breasts, but all I can say is that I think life is more important than breasts...espec. when there are such good plastic surgeons around.

Got my answer today.  Everything is fine!!!  The tingling and itching around the scar are *normal.*  Nerves do regenerate after a period of time, and a lot of the numbness I have from surgery will go away. I also told the doctor about the blood vessels that break so easily in my hands and thumb when I sweep or vacuum, the lines of red bruises that follow the veins in my arms and legs occasional, and he says this is from chemo, that the chemo has thinned the vein membranes, and this will improve with time.  But this does not put me at risk for stroke because those are usually arterial (or so I HOPE so!!!)... Thanks for all your well wishes and I hope this helps those of you who have also been experiencing this problem. Linora",

The wire doesn't hurt...they numb you up first; the wire is inserted with the help of ultrasound, and it is there to point exactly where they find the abnormal tissue.  It isn't exactly fun to sit around for hours with that thing in your boob waiting for surgery,  but you can focus on other things and forget about it.The dye thing is pretty simple...mine was injected by two happy pregnant nurses who didn't seem the least bit worried about the radioactivity.  Bring a book.

Tell us more about your situation.  There are a lot of us who have been through BC and we've done just fine.",

Then suddenly, overnight,  I have severe itching and tingling around the scar and under my arm where the numbness was.  There is no visible irritation and I can't feel a lump, but the discomfort level is bad enough to keep me awake at night.  The only thing that seems to help is rub the area with a bristle brush...I know that sounds crazy but I was getting desperate.  This seems to spread out the tingling and leave me comfortable for a few hours. I am thinking of making an appointment to see my surgeon. Linora  \"Without art, the crudeness of reality would make the world unbearable.\" George Bernard Shaw.
