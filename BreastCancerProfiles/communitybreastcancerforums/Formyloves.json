March 23 I felt a lump in my left breast near my areola. I went to my gyno who mentioned it could be hormonal and to watch it 3 weeks later it was still there and it was recommended that I have a ultrasound. The Tuesday after mothers day I had the ultrasound done and they said it was a fibroadenoma which is a benign tumor. The radiologist said he could biopsy it, but again because of my age and lack of family history he wouldn't recommend it. He even stated that if I was a family member of his he wouldn't recommended. My mom kept pushing me to be more agressive and have a biopsy. I went to a general surgeon about 3 weeks after my u/s and he started me on antibiotics thinking maybe it was a breast infection since I was breast feeding. 6 weeks or so later on july 07 I had a lumpectomy. On July 11 I was informed I did indeed have breast cancer. Left mastectomy on july 11 with 22/40 lymph nodes positive. Not meaning to freak you out but make sure you are comfortable with your decision.",

My daughter was a month and a half shy of her 2 nd birthday when I was diagnosed and my son was going into kindergarten. Everyone tolerates chemo differently. Some people have a hard time and for some it's easier. I received chemo every 3 weeks and although day 2&3 I needed help because I was a little ill. Most days I was ok. Maybe a little tired, but it was manageable. I also learned quickly to take the nausea meds at the first sign of nausea I made it through and now am coming up to 1 year from diagnoses.
