    "Content": "Sep 2, 2017 03:43PM - edited Sep 2, 2017 03:45PM by GS2009 I am seven years out from a unilateral mastectomy with no reconstruction. I have always been small chested and did not want to go through reconstruction. I have worn a prosthesis for 7 years now and am so tired of dealing with trying to find tops that are high cut enough that my prosthesis won't show. And I'm sick and tired of wearing it! And don't even get me started on swim wear. Not to mention still having to get mammograms and worrying that it will appear in the remaining breast. If knew then what I know now, I wouldn't bat an eye....I'd have them BOTH taken off and live with a flat chest.",
