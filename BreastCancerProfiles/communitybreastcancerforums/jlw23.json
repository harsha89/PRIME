I went into see my doctor the next day and she said she could NOT feel any lump, but wanted to send me for a mammogram. Today I went in for my 1st Mammogram and ended up having to have an ultrasound done too.  The doctor told me that in my mammogram there was a cluster of calcium that were close to my nipple in my left breast. He wants me to have a Stereotactic Guided Biopsy done. The appointment has been set for the 27th of September, and I AM SCARED!!!  I feel like the doctor wasnt giving me enough information, and all I coming across online is how it is Cancer.... Does anyone have an advice or a similar story out there?????? Log in to post a reply",
