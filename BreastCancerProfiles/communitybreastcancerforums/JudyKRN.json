About a week or so ago, I began to have a horrendous sore throat (not when swallowing liquids or saliva, only solids.) I thought it was a side effect from Ibrance. I was given magic mouthwash but it didn't help. When I saw my radiologist, he thinks it's from the rads. I do have some redness at the neck, on my right side. Has anyone else experienced this?",

Xgeva helps with bone strength and blocks the action of the cancer in the bone. Personally, for me, the benefits outweigh the risks. I don't want to worry about possible fractures or paralysis, when I'm concentrating on being as well as I can. I have multiple bone mets and osteopenia. Now this is just my opinion, of course.....",

No organs are involved and the brain MRI was okay. I am being treated at Delnor Hospital, in Geneva Illinois. They are part of the Northwestern group. I went there for my initial treatment, 11 years ago. My surgeon is wonderful. I'm well aware of the potential dangers of NSAID's and Tylenol. And I'm sure that's why my oncologist is being very cautious with dosing. Next visit, at the end of the month, my oncologist will check my tumor markers. Hopefully the have decreased in number. Thanks! ",
