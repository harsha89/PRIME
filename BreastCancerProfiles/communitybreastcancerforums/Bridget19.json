This place has really helped me realize that life doesn't end with a stage iv dx. I started Kadcyla 6 weeks ago and just had my third dose last Wednesday. Was on Taxotere, Herceptin and Perjeta for 3,5 years and had a good run. Must say that I tolerate Kadcyla much better than THP. The only side effect is fatigue for 6-7 days after the infusion, but that's it. The food is tasting good again, no diarrhea and my hair starts growing back! The next scans are scheduled for october, but since the last blood result showed my CA 15-3 dropped from 60 to 36 and CEA from 26 to 6 I'm cautiously optimistic. ",
