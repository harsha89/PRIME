She said, yes, the third time.  I told her I just finished with 30 treatments on August 22. She said, \"one thing they don't tell you about radiation is how FOGGY it makes you feel,\" and I said OH THANK GOD! I was beginning to think something else was wrong with me!\"  I had to be out of town for treatment as I live 2 1/2 hours from the nearest treatment center. I went home and went back to work as soon as my treatments ended.  For some reason, I felt a little euphoric the last few days of my treatment.  Then the anxiety set in as I floundered around trying to establish a new routine now that the daily routine around treatment was over. I tried to work  full time and found that my brain didn't process information right in the afternoon when I became tired.  I leave letters out of words when writing, and can't proof read an article for beans. I do pretty well early in the mornings, but have just given up and gone home from the office after lunch to avoid making more mistakes. I'm two months out from radiation and am at least as tired as I was during treatment.  I know this isn't necessarily typical, but I believe it is more common than some of our doctors let us know. In fact, my doctor thought I should see a neurologist. But a friend of mine with cancer said it was normal and it would go away.",

I mentioned it to the radiation oncologist and the oncology nurses.  All of them said it wasn't a side effect of radiation. However, every other woman that I saw in the waiting room during that period of time said she was experiencing dizziness.  That made about six of us, so the nurse said it was probably a virus.  I had started a high protein diet and was told to stay well hydrated, and I actually began to feel less tired and the dizziness went away.  Now that treatments are over and I'm not making sure I have the same amount of protein and not drinking as much water as I should, I'm having some lightheadedness/ dizziness again.  Coincidence?  Maybe not. . . . ",
