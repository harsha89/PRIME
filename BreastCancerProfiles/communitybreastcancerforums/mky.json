She went through chemo and radiation and she's doing really well right now, but her family has a full history of breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer. She tested positive for BRCA2 and I did as well summer of 2012. At the time I was living in Japan (I got tested when visiting home) and knew that I wouldn't be getting anything done while living out of the country so I spent that entire year researching and reading blogs and came to the pretty solid decision that I wanted to DO something about it. When I moved back to the US this past August, freshly unemployed and happily single, I immediately (ended up being a 2-month process) got myself back on my parents' insurance and started setting up all the necessary appointments to speak with people. It seemed the general consensus was that tamoxifen wasn't really something anyone recommended for me because of my age at the side effects so: 1) surveillance or 2) Prophylactic surgery I didn't feel that surveillance was right for me. My priority wasn't catching cancer early, it was not getting cancer at all. So we started talking about surgery. It's important to note that I've always been pretty uninterested in having kids and those moments where I think I might someday want them usually involve me heavily considering adoption. In other words: Having biological kids has never really been a priority for me and getting to breastfeed is even lower on the list. And then, taking into account my currently unemployed/living with parents who've been through similar&WORSE/on my parents' insurance, it made sense to do it immediately when my life was already at this inbetween moment where all I needed to do was delay the job search for about a year. TL;DR My genetic counselor, ob/gyn, BS, and PS were convinced I had thought through everything thoroughly and agreed that a prophylactic double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction was the best choice for me. Everything moved really quickly for me. My MRI was on New Year's Eve and I got a phone call from my BS discussing the results on Jan. 7th & during that same call my PS had a cancellation so she scheduled me for my first surgery exactly a week later. My BS and PS decided that, because I was young, healthy, and had large and dense breasts (44DDD), a staged mastectomy/reconstruction would be preferable.  The agreed-upon procedure (highly recommended by both surgeons) was to first get a simple breast reduction to get size and shape and then when that healed ~3 months later they'd do a full mastectomy with direct-to-implant reconstruction. They called it a 'staged mastectomy' for the sake of insurance. This past Tuesday (Jan. 14th) I had the breast reduction completed and am feeling great. My surgeons are really thrilled and excited for me and the only sobering comments have so far been about the next step: my ovaries and tubes, but that's a decision for another time and I can only hope I'll feel as confident about it as I did about this.",
