I live a very happy life post-cancer, until something feels wrong and then a dark cloud covers me until I get an 'all clear' from my doctor. I hate how the fear of mets can dampen my happy times so completely, but it does. My doctor tells me that this will get better in time. I would prefer hearing that advice from someone who has walked the walk, but I appreciate his words all the same. All the best to your mom. She's lucky to have a daugher who takes the time to inquire about her. So, all the best to you too! During these past years of my life I can honestly say that it has been easier being the person with cancer than it has been watching a loved one have cancer. I'm sorry for you and I'm sorry this happened to your mom :(",

I am 550+ days breast cancer free (no I don't actually count, someone asked me the other day so I looked it up :) and have had a dry cough for over two months now. Hospital put me on steroids for a couple weeks, worked a bit but came back right after I stopped. GP has me back on steroids and an acid reflux drug, neither really working. We are going to go to CT scan next but I wanted to try everything else before I take the radiation hit. Here's the thing. Although I am paralyzed with fear right now, a feeling I don't have to explain to anyone on this site, it doesn't feel like a lung thing to me. It feels like a dry irritation in the lower back of my throat. I don't have shortness of breath. Can take a big breath without causing cough. If anyone has experience with a dry cough that ended either in a positive way or not, please let me know how you felt. My family is just getting back on our feet after losing my 33 year old sister in law to cervical cancer, I am terrified to put them through this again. I'm sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong place or if the question has already been addressed somewhere else.Â ",

I just checked out some posts by other tamoxifen users and it seems that they suffer with some dry coughs too. I won't know until I know but I appreciate your post. You've calmed me down a bit. I'm am so sorry to see your Dx. I wish you well. Thank you for being here.",
