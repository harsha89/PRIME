Around 2 years ago I found a lump in my right breast and sorta' just let it ride because I was scared. (Yes, I know that doesn't make any sense!) I've never been sick and hadn't needed to go to the doctor in quite a few years. Well, miracleously this lump just suddenly disappeared a few months later. I thought maybe since it went away it was nothing serious and went about my business. Around a year later I noticed another lump in the same breast just a different place. Ironically this happened to be October of LAST year and the Breast Cancer Awareness stuff on TV just scared the hell out of me so I just finally went for a full exam with my family doctor. She thought that the lump was fibroadenoma but to make sure she scheduled an ultrasound a week later. I went to our local hospital and had it done there. The techinican was completely cold to me and told me it had debris and it shouldn't be there. (Think so genius?) My mother who is a registered nurse decided to bring me to a breast center to see a specialist. Boy am I glad I went there. The ultrasound was done fairly quick (it felt like forever though) and the doctor came in. He said it was indeed fibroadenoma and that I had a second lump (apparently the one that went away but shrunk down in size making it impossible to feel). He said that it's very common and that I should go back in 6 months for a follow up.  Now, the appointment is next Wedesnday and I'm freaking out all over again. I keep thinking what if it got larger and I don't even know? What if I need surgery? All of these \"what ifs\" and I'm just driving myself nuts over this. I'm only 24 years old and traumatic thing that's happened to me is having my wisdom teeth surgically removed.  I want to allow myself not to worry and say everything is fine, but I don't want to go in there positive and get negative news. I'm usually so positive about things... I guess when it's you, it's different. Any advice or anything would be greatly appreciated.   Edit: I thought I should add I have no family history on either side of any types of cancer. I know I could still get cancer, but I guess it gives me hope I won't. Log in to post a reply",
