Maybe a bit sicker in myself. But am avoiding like crazy presenting at the hospital because I am due to go out of town tomorrow afternoon, and will see a PS, BS and Immnologist as part of that trip. So if I can just hang in there.... I don't think I am sick enough to be hospitalized, but can't risk it happening, because if I am, it'll be back to the same crazy merry-go-round of non-answers. And once I turn up there, they will refer me on to somebody down here for the to take an eternity to see me, let alone get any tests underway. Anyway, it's pointless now - I am out of town all week, hence setting up appts in another city The alternate explanation that Infectious Diseases has given me is either Lymphadema or some inflammatory reaction. I have appts with docs dealing with both on Tues and Wed, the PS tomorrow. Am thinking the PS will at least be able to give me a reassurance that it's OK for now, or be able to tell if it's not OK. I was originally meant to see him re next DIEP. But all that's gone out the window for now.  I honestly don't know now if it is 'worse' than it was on abx or not. I certainly feel 'hotter' in my chest area, and the heat in my back is new (it's also quite tender to touch in places). I don't know if it LOOKS any redder, and I don't have a temp at all. I felt pretty sick on the abx, and that hasn't changed.    I know I shouldn't be self managing, but in the absence of anyone else picking up the mantle, it's all I can do. I guess if I start to spike a fever or become much more unwell, I will have to front up. 24 Hours and counting...",

There are all sorts of human things that come into play that weren't there before -  guilt, denial, anger, a wish for it all to go away, the desire to pretend it's not happening or it hasn't happened or whatever...and those things can get in the way of you getting the care that you need in order to get better. Trust your gut instincts and do what is right for you.

So it is good to have support from yet another angle.  It is VERY frustrating when they try to pin it on emotional stuff when you so clearly know it is physical. I can absolutely feel the difference. I don't think they (mostly white, middle aged men, unfortunately) understand that it is possible to lose your breasts and not completely fall apart.

But both, at least, prepared to do something. Imm has recommended prednisone, other guy 6 weeks of lymphatic massage and THEN nail it with broad spectrum abx. I am just relieved to hear anything but 'it'snot an infection but we don't know what it is' and 'it'll go away on its own in time'. I will probably follow the advice of the infection guy (it just FEELS that way to me) and then jump on a plane to go and see him in 6 weeks or so. Given up on my PS, he just doesn't want to know and is convinced that it's just scar tissue/vascular. Went to see a physio yesterday who specialises in lymphatic massage, and she also reckons it is infection. She showed me how to do the massage and I will see her next week. So at the very least, I feel like SOMETHING is happening, and it is good for me to be able to do something. Still very tired and sore and fluey, though, and aware I just shoudn't be feeling like this. PS basically thinks that aspect is all in my head. But I have been clinically depressed before and medicated, ditto for anxiety, and it ain't ether of those. Yes, I am emotionally exhausted, but this is more than that. I've been dealing with that for 12 + years of kids and running a business and BRCA worries and fears and sick parents and a type-1 diabetic husband and a daughter with very major health concerns of her own. So I know emotional burnout, and this is not it.  What is going on is pissing me off and dragging me down, but it is firmly in my body. In my n-oob area, to be precise. ",

Given that all this has been going on for 4 months now, I am really surprised it has taken this long for my dormant anxiety to rear its ugly head.

The trick will be to find someone with enough experience in NZ in DIEP. It is such a new process here, and because the funding in our public health system is such a mess, lots of women don't even bother with recon - it's too hard to get chucked on a waiting list and keep on getting ditched off. So guessing that even those who do it aren't getting a wole lot of practice.  I am so scared by the thought of the long surgery, though. They say the implant failure rate due to infection is 2.5% - I wonder what the death/disabilty rate for DIEP is. I sort of feel like now I have joined the 2.5% club for this, what''s stopping other dreadful 2.5% things happening? God, what's to stop me being one of those people who go on to get invasive b/ca or peritoneal ca despite the (I thought at the time) prophylactic surgeries? I think it just opens up all different kinds of scariness. Susiered, have you thought about time frame for next surgery? I would love to reconstruct but I couldn't do it for a while - I need to focus on work for a bit, it's all been so destructive, and I really want time for my body to heal. Will you do implants again? I am going to get a bunch of different opinions next time around, I really think I didn't ask enough questions last time around. Which is just one of the hundred and one things I blame myself for. I am constantly beating myself up for all the things I could have/ should have done differently, and wondering if the outcome would have been different. Thanks, Barbara. I know I need to focus on just getting better. It is very comforting to know there are so many strong women here who don't feel the need to have mounds of fat on their chests to feel complete/female. I wish I was that pragmatic. But I am not (yet...). I think it will help when I can go prosthesis shopping - everything is closed here for the Xmas/NY break, so I don't even have the fluffies or whatever you guys call them. God knows where I would be without this/your site. They discharged me from hosp with no post op instructions/restrictions and not a mention of prostheses or whatever. I might as well have had a mole removed. Angela, my PS says the same - he wants DIEP next time around. Fortunately he doesn't do that surgery. I am pissed as hell with him, and I don't know why. Rationally I know this isn't his fault. But I am not in a particularly rational frame of mind right now. Feel like writing a self-help boo:\"When Good Implants Go Bad\". ",

Hopefully getting a clear and firm plan will help alleviate some of the anxiety I am experiencing (I think just another sign of absolute physical and mental overload). It is going to be a tough decision timing wise, as if I go back in for implants, I think it would need to be in a few months, but not too many months, as scar tissue etc forms. If it is DIEP, I need to ready my life, business and family for some pretty radical disruption (oh dear, here we go again!).  The most incredible thing happened the other day. I was feeling particularly down and anxious about the whole thing, and wondering how on earth I was going to find the  'top 3' surgeons in town I am determined to get opinions from, before a final decision, and I had this completely serendipitous experience. I had gone to a new place to have my nails done, and asked the girl to be esp careful re sterilising equipment, washing her hands etc because I had been v sick, and didn't want to pick up something else/pass on my bugs.  We got to talking and she said 'Oh, S does the nipples'. I was like, 'who's S?' and she said 'she owns the salon. She's out, but back in a minute'. Now, this is a very small town and nipple artistes are hardly on every corner. S is, as far as I know, the only person in a very wide geographic range doing them. And of course, she sees the work of practically every surgeon in town! She was fab. Gave me my list, talked about the benefits of autogenous vs implants, what kind o surgery works for which sort of people. And also gave me a gentle, but neeed 'get over yourself' talk about my fears of having to get dumped into the public health system to access a DIEP surgeon.  Isn't life funny?! ",

I spent some time over at Breastfree this am, thanks Barbara - it is so comforting to know that there other other options and people live through this, even though in my wildest dreams I would never have thought I would even consider no recon. I am not sure what I wll do, ultimately. Just need to get through this nightmare first. Susan, I am sorry you went through it twice. That would be my biggest fear, going through all this again and it still not working out. I am going to take some time out to think before deciding next steps. But for now I will get rid of both. I think it will be less weird that way, and I really have come to hate the implants, anyway. 2 hours til surgery time...I have to walk back down to the hosp shortly. My biggest fear is waking up and feeling terribly disfigured. I wish I could just move past it, but I can't seem to. 'No recon' was never on my list of options when I started down this path. And I am scared that it is now a possibility.  ",

The surgeon who does the DIEP here has trained and worked os. I haven't yet met him, I will be asking how many he has done. If he has worked in US/UK he may well have done a few. Keeping my fingers crossed! I am also going to suss out who is in Auckland, our main population base, as I figure by dint of numbers they must do more. I agree, the numbers really matter.  The other option might be Australia. Again, out of pocket for the recon but wouldn't be at such massive financial risk re the complications as I think we have a reciprocal agreement with them re public healths system",

The relief from physical pain and discomfort is quite immense, though I have been so sick from all the antibiotics, it is only now that I am stopping them, that I think I will start to come really right. I am not sure about the trip - I think I would have been fine 10 days out (today, for me) if I had not coped so badly with the antibiotics. You probably also have to be prepared to not be entirely healed - even 3 days ago they were worried that the infection hadn't fully cleared. Not needing pain relief, though, and just v tired from the anesthetic still. I got all the info re what to wear and buy etc on line, and then chased the info around locally (NZ). It seems like here, when you get a mastectomy w/out recon they come and talk to  you about prostheses and give you fluffies and stuff, but because my mastectomy was with immediate recon 3 months ago, I fell through the cracks.  Breast care nurse seems to have been the source of all wisdom on this for me. The nurse at the hospital was kind enough to arrange to have her come and talk to me when I went for my appt today.Oh - fluffies are like wee dacron filled pouches that you pin into your bra to make it look like you've got something in the interim, til you're healed enough for prostheses. In terms of whether to wait or not - 10, 20 days is a long time in the life of an infection, and you might find it turns on you while you are away, without your standard support systems and access to usual medical care etc. I def wouldn't risk it if it were me. Hope it all works out, keep in touch, and sorry you had to join the club :( ",

I just didn't want you hanging on on your own! I have never heard of birthmarks and bca being connected, but there is a lot of wisdom here and lots of people who might know. I have been told that the link between family history of bca and melanoma is not really, really strong. My family history on my mother's side is breast and ovarian cancer, which is an all-bad combination. My father had very serious melanoma in his 20s, but nobody seemed too worried about it in relation to the breast/ovarian thing. Though certainly, I get extra, separate screening for that  I do know that doctors have told me that my daughter doesn't need to worry about the breast/ovarian cancers til she is at least 25. From what I understand, under 20 is very young for this to be a concern. But again, others here will know a lot more than I do . You should decinitely get the area things checked out, anyway, especially with the scabbing and the lump. Is there any reason you wouldn't feel OK seeing a doctor about it? It sounds like it would certainly give you peace of mind, and it would be good for you to talk to somebody about your family history of skin cancer and what it might mean for you. Hope you get some reassurance on this. ",
