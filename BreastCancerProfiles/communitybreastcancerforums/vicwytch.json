Meeting oncologist on Monday to talk about whether I need the tamoxifen or not. Now I've developed a rash under my left arm -- from armpit running past the drain opening. I took off the surgical bra in case that was it before going to bed last night but that didn't help. No fever. Anyone else have this?? This tissue expander is HARD! wow. Didn't expect that!",

Had my first fill in the left tissue expander last Friday. Everything was ok this weekend but today the pain of stretching was not great to deal with--and I only had 50 cc's!! Started Tamoxifen mid-February and so far nothing major with that. I think it's because I take it at night before I go to bed so the worst may be happening when I sleep. It may also be the reason for some very vivid dreams!! People at work and my friends/family have been so incredibly supportive during this time. I hope you all are experiencing that as well. I'm ready to move on but my body is asking me to take it slow--so I guess I need to listen to it!!",

I have a question for you: will the hospital give me a 'bra' or some contraption to wear home after the surgery? I'm thinking I don't want to wear my own bra into the hospital if I won't need it coming home. Little things. I've got to admit as the day creeps closer, I'm getting a little nervous. Some gal friends of mine took me out for dinner last Friday and really treated me super. They all wore something pink, and brought me little gifts: candles, lotion, lip balm, fingernail polish, Magic Mike XXL (they know me well), checkout magazines, journals, etc. It was so unexpected and so nice! Made me cry. I've also gone out and bought a stool for the tub, and some de-stressor bath bombs to help this anxiety this week. Did you guys do anything special right before surgery?",

Although I should talk to them about Valium and see if that would interfere... Anyway, I decided to put on a mastectomy bra this afternoon and it has helped immensely. I think going braless was pulling on the drain spot and it was aggravating my side and back. Now I feel bound, but better. Hope it keeps the pain contained.",

I am done--they have one more fill to do next week (which will be the overfill) and so my size is fitting a nice B cup (350cc). The surgeon called today to schedule my implants on may 30th. When I get my implant on the left, they will augment and lift my right breast as well. I cannot wait until this hard, uncomfortable TE is OUT of my body. Hurts now that it is pretty large. I've been having quite a few hot flashes on the tamoxifen. And extreme dry mouth and skin. I go back to mo in May to check in. Since my cancer was mostly DCIS and very limited invasive, I wonder if it's even worth taking it for 5 years. And I have a few more months before my period will be gone for a year so maybe I can get them to switch me over to the post-menopausal medication.

I decided to do only the left breast cuz the right has been healthy and I'll be augmenting that one to match the left eventually. :-) My girlfriends are throwing me a party this Friday at our favorite watering hole to say bye bye to the boob and hope for good outcomes of the surgery. I've also started the work FMLA/medical leave paperwork too. I'm really curious for those who have had a unilateral mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy and with tissue expander as to what your leave time was off from work. I have a huge presentation that I am leading a WEEK AFTER my surgery. It is for a major competition in my company and I cannot let down my teammates. So I am very worried as to whether I will be able to go in for that. It's a 15 minute presentation and I know I will have to ask my husband to drive me and I'll need to wear clothes that can hide my drains. I do have a contingency plan in place however, in case I just cannot physically do it. But I am hopeful and positive until I have to make a decision.",
