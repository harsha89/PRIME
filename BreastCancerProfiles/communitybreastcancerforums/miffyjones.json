There is so much info online here - do a search and hopefully it can explain it better than I ever could. I am currently on a platinum drug called cisplatin, as well as avastin, and gemcetabine and am awaiting adding a PARP inhibitor via a possible clinical trial - this is a real aggressive treatment regimen that I am on and may not be right for you, but talk all this through with your oncologist - push hard for the info you need and don't stop asking questions until you are fully satisfied that you both come to the best course of action for your particular situation. I've attached some links on PARPs for you. http://forum.tnbcfoundation.org/parp-success-stories_topic6428_page10.html",
