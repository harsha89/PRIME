      "Content": "LynnMM wrote: This is my first post...I was diagnosed Stage IV in January 2013 with liver mets. I had a fabulous run with Tamoxifen, but since then things haven't been so great. My onco put me on co exemestane after I started to get bad side effects after seven months on Xeloda. He said if that didn't work or stopped working, the next step would be Faslodex. However, after about three months on co exemestane, I went back to see him. My tumour was protruding more, but my husband and I couldn't tell if it was overall bigger or not. My onco decided, without a CT scan, that the next step should be paclitaxol. He seems to have jumped quickly to an assumption that I am no longer ER+ or at least no longer responding to hormone therapy. My husband just sent him an email asking why the sudden change from thinking Faslodex was the next step, and isn't trying Xeloda again a possibility. I was under the impression that when one hormone drug doesn't work, you try another and that one not working doesn't mean the next one won't. I'm wondering if anyone out there has any experience with this and advice for me. Log in to post a reply",

It is a very grey day here in Ottawa, so your messages are a good pick-me-up. Aoibheann - did your doctor do another biopsy to see if you were still ER+, or just go from the assumption that you were?",
