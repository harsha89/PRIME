I have only seen one MO, but he polled several of his colleagues for me from other institutions. None of them gave a strong opinion. There were a lot of \"maybe\" there will be a small benefit to chemotherapy. It is considered by this group of MOsto be a patient preference up to a certain cut-off in the intermediate range, which is for some 20+ and for others 25+. I feel like, at this point, I would not benefit from a formal second opinion. As the decision seems to fall squarely on my shoulders, I have found the guidance from people in similar circumstances to be invaluable. So, thank you so much, ladies for continuing to contribute.",

The lump on my rib feels similar, but smaller and a little harder, almost like a small marble. My BS looked at it on ultrasound and said it is definitely a lymph node. Before my breast cancer dx, I would accept the benign explanation for things, thinking I am young and healthy so it is probably nothing. I guess that feeling is gone forever and I will now always jump to the worst case scenario. So, I guess it is pretty clear that I am feeling grouchy and down. I feel like there was a certain relief getting through major surgery without complications. Now that is wearing off and I am just plain scared that my future is uncertain.

I don't think you should push yourself, and I definitely do not think you should feel lazy for allowing your body to recover from major surgery! Obviously, I don't know your hubby, but if he is anything like mine, he is probably relieved to have a concrete way of helping you (taking care of the kids, picking up the slack at work). I think that type of support comes easier to some guys than sharing emotions. Continued thoughts and wishes for a speedy recovery!",

She said that she made a plan to do the surgery in the evening if she has to report to the court. Not sure how I feel about that. Last minute changes are throwing us for a loop! I am really nervous the whole thing will get postponed. I also confimed that the PS will try to perform direct to implant reconstruction, but may have to switch to A tissue expander if my skin is too thin. Has anyone heard about pros/cons of direct to implant reconstruction? Thanks for your insights, and I am most definitely keeping you all in my thoughts and prayers.  P.S. My husband has to tend to the kids so he won't be at the hospital to give me my bag after my surgery. Hospital is just going to have to deal with that and keep my bag safe for me!",

I made them give me Tylenol instead of narcotic pain management. The docs thought I was being overly ambitious, but Tylenol really is enough to take the edge off the pain for me. My major discomfort right now is that my nausea patch is making my vision blurry. I can't actually focus on the message I sm writing right now...so hopefully no typos. Sending good vibes to everyone!",

It is great that you are permitted to exercise. My PS permits nothing at all for 4 weeks, not even light housework. Don't get me wrong, I am contentto do no housework, but a walk would be awesome.",
