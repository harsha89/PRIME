I'm not only fighting breast cancer, I'm fighting having RSD for the rest of my life..... which is a whole different hell for some. I'm prepping for Radiation in 4 days. I'm afraid it will bring my RSD to the point of no return. If you know what RSD is you'll know what that means. No doctors seem to know or won't say what radiation will do. I'm scared to death of living in a wheel chair and in extreme pain the rest of my life. What they do say is..... don't you want to live? Haha easy for them to say if they don't have this horrific nerve disorder and the emmense pain that comes with it the longer you have it or the possibility of lymphedema and the debilitation of ones limbs and body through a lifetime of progression with RSD. A little about the situation. I am newly RSD diagnosed in the last 4 months from a leg fracture 8 months ago that must have damaged my sympathetic nerve but until I was out of an immobilized state the RSD didn't present obvious symptoms. I've had very little nerve pain from the RSD and refused to believe I had it till i was attacked by nerve pain. I'm still in a \u201cmay go into remission\" window with aggreasive PT that Im still engaged in throughout the bc diagnosis, making progress and recently graduating to a cane. Yay me! Since my dx just over a month ago, I've had multiple biopsies and lumpectomy surgery, removing a 1.3cm tumor invasive (DCIS) stage 1b and 11 SLN removals with 10 sentinel and 1 intramammary LN with micrometacell involvement. Onc dx score was at 12. Radiation therapy has been advised over both prior to OncDx score. SInce the above has taken place over a month ago, the area of removal of both the lumpectomy and LN removal is extremely painful, achy uncomfortable swollen, numb & tingly in arm pit and down back of arm and I'm getting a type of phantom pain in my opposite (good) underarm LN area as well. My inscions are 3 inches apart, 4 inches long on my r breast upper right quadrant and underarm. Any discomfort and pain now come from that general area. I'm just 5 weeks post op. Ive had 2 professionals check from afar for lymphedema signs and nope all looks fine. Well Great! But why does this feel wrong inside then? If it feels like this now, what will 21 radiation treatments do to me? Do I care at this point? I want to fight I want to live, I want to understand what is going to hurt my body, my future, my LIFE. Can anyone answer this or know where I can get real answers. Neurologist don't talk to the oncologist, and no one knows or deals with lymphedema that can be a direct result of RSD And the nerves being effected. This is possible nerve damage from the surgery that can be effecting the RSD And perhaps making this area the newer spot of where my rsd is attckingme. Thanks in advance Warriors!",
