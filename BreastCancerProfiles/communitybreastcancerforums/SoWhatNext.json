I deliberately didn't include my DX because my question is really a statistical one.  Having a straight answer to that (from my Onc I mean) would enable me to weigh up the risks v the benefits for me.  All I'm asking for is a fair idea of where I stand, instead of being scared into treatment with inflated risk assessments.  I know rads with lumpectomy is standard of care.  But it's still my right to work out whether my perceived benefit is worth the potential risk. To answer your question I had a lumpectomy, IDC 1.7cm, Stage 2a, Grade 2, ER/PR+ve, HER2-ve.  Big clear margins, 1/1 nodes with very small amount of cancerous cells at the bottom of the s/node indicating, according to my surgeon, that it was caught in the very early stages of moving.   My question to the forum is if I have a risk profile of 10% (is that correct, since it's based on the risk profile provided by the Oncotype?) and my Onc says my risk of recurrence is 30-50%, is that 30-50% of my 10% baseline?  Can I do rads and improve from 90% to 93% or 94% or 95%?  I clearly don't trust my onc very much - but that's largely because he said quite confidently that the Oncotype took into account radiation therapy, which they clearly don't!",

I'm new here (this is my first post) but I'm due to start rads on 31 January so I guess I qualify. BUT I'm still not mentally committed to doing rads.  I've had the planning and the tats but every time I think about submitting to a treatment called radiation therapy I go to goo.  I think the reason I'm so unsure is because I don't feel like my rad onc is being straight about my real risk of a recurrence and that he's just using scare tactics and plucking stats out of his a**.  So instead of just hovering around this forum I thought I'd ask for help.  Here goes: I had an Oncotype score of 15 which gave me a recurrence rate of 10%.  I know it's about chemo, but my baseline risk is 10% and if I have chemo my risk is still 10%.  I also did an online nomogram called IBTR! (stands for Ipsilateral Breast Tumour Recurrence) which also came back at 10% - without any RT I might add.  But my rad onc says my chance of a recurrence without RT is 30, 35 could be as high as 40% (and last visit it became 50%).  My question to him was How can I be as high as 50% in your office, but 10% on my Oncotype (hadn't done the IBTR! then)?  He said because the Oncotype assumed a course of RT because it's the standard treatment.   So I rang Genomic Health and they said they don't know anything about anyone's tumour size, age, type of surgery, treatment, etc etc - except for their explicitly stated assumption about hormone therapy.  They just test the tumour sample they're provided with. My question is: If my rad onc is saying I have a roughly 40% chance of a recurrence, is that 40% of the 10%?  Am I being asked to do rads for a maybe 3% - 5% benefit?  I can't get him to understand relative and absolute risk - he just blathers on about how there are no absolutes with BC (I know that) and that if I was his sigificant other he would insist on RT.  Or am I wrong to think my 10% recurrence risk on the Oncotype is relevant?  I'm assuming a 10% risk is a 10% risk is a 10% risk.  Sorry if my question is a bit garbled - I'm feeling pretty garbled at the moment. One last thing  - I'm in the process of getting a second opinion, but the only other onc on my little island works as a junior to my onc, so I don't hold out much hope that there'll be much disagreement between them.  Thanks for any help anyone can give me.",
