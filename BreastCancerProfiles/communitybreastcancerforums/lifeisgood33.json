In consultation with oncologists, surgeons -none had seen it before. I spoke with other medical providers ( as well as looking online) and i learned how rare this is. As a result, no one knew how to treat it. I requested and was given a consult to Mayo which included a PET scan. PET scan did not reveal any other 'hot'areas. After being seen there, the oncologist was of the opinion that this is just breast cancer but way out on the far end of the spectrum because of the neuroendocrine features. This was, in part, due to family history. both my mom and maternal gmother had bc. I'm now into my 6th week since my diagnosis. I saw my surgeon today and he is ready to do a lumpectomy with sentinel node. I'm trying to get one more review of the pathology slides to confirm one of the pending diagnoses. Any advice or thoughts? Anyone know of someone who has NET in the breast? I've looked at the forum for rare/different/unusual bc but didn't find much. Thanks for the forum.
