It's hard to push it out of my mind at night because there are no distractions. I'm reminding myself there are lots of things it could be besides cancer. My husband finally understood today when I explained how draining it is to have these worrisome symptoms and all people say is \"Don't worry it's nothing.\" or \"I bet it's just (fill in the blank).\" I think it's best for me to just not talk about it until I know for sure.",

My OBGYN then started me on antibiotics thinking it may be an infection but today she told me it's not.  She basically said she has no idea, maybe it could be my implants, but the mammo showed they are perfectly intact and they are also under the muscle so they shouldn't really be causing an issue like this. I called my OBGYN just now to see if she can send me for an MRI before I go see the specialist, that way I won't have to wait so long.  I'm very scared. I had to have my 2 yr old with me at the appointment and he sat on my lap when I was on the exam table.  I feel so bad cuz he got scared when I had to lay back.  I keep seeing him in my head with his little arms strectched out and his face looking very worried and him saying \"Mama! No Mama!\".  I'm so scared that I have cancer and since I'm young it's the more aggressive kind. It's been like 2 or 3 months since I fist noticed the nipple change/lump. What if it's advanced?  I can't not raise my son.  He's everything to me and he deserves to have a mommy. My friends/family keep saying it's nothing, it's impossible that it's cancer, etc. etc.  But it's actually MORE draining to hear that.  I feel like I have to re-explain to people my symptoms and justify the fact that I'm going to the Doctor. Anyway I'm just venting... Log in to post a reply",

My surgeon sent me for a 2nd US & this time they saw it. I'm getting a biopsy and frankly, you should be getting one too. From what I understand, if you have discharge, that can be biopsied as well. It's most likely not cancer for either of us, but a biopsy is the only way to know for sure. Contact a breast surgeon or your dr and ask for one.",

Since then it hasn't really grown, but the tissue around it has gotten harder. And my nipple has retracted more noticeably. After 1 mammo & 2 US's, I'm finally scheduled for a surgical biopsy in 2 weeks. But I'm scared that's too long to wait. I'm very thankful to have the surgery, but I've read women's stories olive where the cancer spread quickly. I'm scared that not only will it be cancer, but that by having to wait & do so many tests b4 a biopsy that it'll have spread. Especially cuz I'm 30 & in younger women cancer is more aggressive. I'm fine all day, but every night I cry thinking that I'm wasting valuable time & the cancer is going to spread through my body and take me away from my baby & husband. I'm being neurotic cuz there's been no diagnosis yet but I can't help it. I know this is mostly nervousness, but I can't sleep cuz I'm so worried! Log in to post a reply",

It's your health and it's better to  be proactive.  If the mammo & us came back clear that's a great sign.  But if you still have suspicious symptoms I don't see the point in waiting till November.  Ask your doctor for an MRI.  And maybe they can biopsy the area where the thickening is.  I'm not sure, but definitely tell your doctor your symptoms and specifically state you don't want to wait until November and would like further testing done now. That being said, it could just be you never saw yourself braless, at that particular angle, in that particular lighting.  Have you gained or lost weight recently? ",
