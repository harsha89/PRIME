I did the blue dyes and it was easy for the surgeon to find the sentinel nodes. Both were negative. Minimal exposure to radiation as compared to being outside in the sun. Very strong family history of breast cancer in maternal grandmother. My mom died at the 33 & my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 56. I'm relieved and after 14 breast biopsies starting at the age of 14, I can finally move on at the age of 55! My surgeon told me my risk of finding a hidden cancer was 20%\u2026I opted for the biopsies of sentinel nodes! Best wishes with your decision.",

Like you, I lost my mother in childhood. I was 2 years old when she died at the age of 33 from breast cancer. My older sister was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 at the age of 56. My maternal GM also died from BCi n her 70's. I have had numerous biopsies (my first one at age 14) and the most recent one showed ADH and ALH in the right breast and some ADH in the left breast. I am having implants, because it seems to be the least invasive procedure. I will be following your posts and keeping positive thoughts in the universe for you!",

Your daughter sounds like a gem. What a great support she must be for you. Your surgical team sounds very caring. Wow---200 cc in your TEs already. You must have quite a nice start to your foobs! Focus on the positive energy and healing thoughts that you have around you including those of us on this site.  Please get some rest and know that I am keeping you in my heart as I talk to God tonight.",

I have my doubts as I read some of the horror stories from persons who have had BMX with implants. I have no more energy left to play this psychological game with cancer. It is comforting to me to hear that your experience has been a good one. April 10th is not that far away. I am hoping for a good experience as well. Thanks again!",

Make sure they wait to give the local anesthetic time to work. I had this done in 2004 & 2012 at two different hospitals by different doctors. The first time, the idiot doctor was in a hurry and did not wait. I was so mad. The pain was awful. The 2012 biopsies were much better because they gave the local anesthetic time to work. Good wishes to you.",
