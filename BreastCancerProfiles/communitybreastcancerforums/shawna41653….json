My heart aches for her so badly I feel so lost and alone but she is with me always . she has gone to where rainbows never die. she fought stage 4 breast cancer for 6 and one half years . she is a survivor ... miss you momma I was truly blessed we held and sung to you as you left us . you were never alone..
