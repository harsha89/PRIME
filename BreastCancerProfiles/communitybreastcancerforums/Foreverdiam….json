My skin is red and itchy plus the skin under my breast has opened and the skin on my nipple/areola has peeled off. With the pain and burning I'm having a hard time just being in my skin. I have been doing everything my nurse tells me plus spending most of the day bra-less and airing out my left chest. Finding radiation emotionally harder than chemo, maybe because I thought I was done feeling like this when I finish chemo. So glad radiation is done for me on Friday. Hope everyone else walking down this road is having a little better day.",
