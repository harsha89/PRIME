I guess that I am hyper sensitive - if the rest of my life was great then I'd maybe cope better, but it's a battleground, work, relationship, trying to pay the rent, I just feel as though I don't have any strength left to fight this fight, if I have to. If I can't work I'll lose my home, and I have only just moved here........my previous landlord sold the house I was renting and so its cost me a lot to move again after only 18 months. I have no savings or other source of income. My divorce was a battle as my ex is an alcoholic - and my job is wearing out women 20 years my junior..........and the man I love is drifting away from me, although he tries hard to pretend that he isn't.............I feel broken......mind, body heart and soul. And scared that life may be about to get even harder than I have ever imagined...........",

Idon't have a lump to find, just this redness and pain with slight swelling............ thanks though, I appreciate your kindness in replying and I wish you well ",

I'm going to keep popping in here to see how you are all doing...........wonderfullymade - we're waititng that biopsy result on Friday.

      "Content": "maedmarion wrote: hello everyone - your posts have been such a comfort to me today.There are so many gutsy wonderful women out there - and the love and caring just floes out from the posts..... I'm really beside myself with fear - I don't have a history of BC but 16 months ago I had a recall from a routine mammogram - 24 hours of fear and imagination making it feel like a week.........but luckily the repeat mammogram and subsequent ultrasound found nothing more than cysts - black holes the radiographer called them - no treatment required and I was discharged to return for my next regular 3 year check. Since then I have had intermittent pain in both breasts, mostly the left one and recently swapped wearing bras for support tops, as the bras were getting so uncomfortable - they'd be ok first thing in the morning but by lunchtime they were tight and my breasts felt as though they'd swollen. Things are better with the support tops although my shape isn't as great - I'm a 38FF so they take some supporting, however its worth it not to get that painfull constricted feeling every day. Aweek or so ago I noticed that my left breast was hurting more frequently and I glanced at it one morning and thought that I must have lain on my hot water bottle as the top of the breast was really red - not really painful though. Anywaym I was in the throes of moving house - manically busy, plus supporting my middle son through a relationship break up, as well as working full time, so you hardly notice your body when you're so drained in every way, do you?  Over the last week or so the left breast got more sore and hot and felt tense and painful when I touched it, plus it looked blotchy red all down the left side  - so on Tuesday I went to my doctor who gave me antiviotics and did an immediate referral to the local Breast Clinic - she said don't worry its only precautionary because of the heat and redness but of course I googled the symptoms and have been crazy with fear ever since - I had never even heard of IBC before and now I'm terrified that I have it.............there's no nipple inversion, or itching and the swelling and redness  has lessened a bit since I started the medicine, I think - but as I haven't had a fever don't see how it can be an infection - am about half way though the 7 day course.  I am so hoping that my symptoms may be due to the fluid filled cysts swelling up but I have no experience of this so the IBC fear has the upper hand - I can't sleep or eat properly and I have wept buckets - don't know how to get through till Thursday - we have free healthcare here in the UK, but I have no sick pay at work ( we get 13 days per year and I used mine due to a kidney infection) and no insurance to pay my salary if I'm ill, so there are huge financial implications as well as all the physical and emotional ones........ please can anyone give me some advice and make me feel less alone?  thank you so much xx marion xx Log in to post a reply",

I had another sleepless night last night and am beginning to feel really spaced out and shaky - my left breast still looks mottled, more so than the right one - and there is still a pain - like I used to get when I wore a boned bra - kind of into my armpit as though a bra bone is pushing into the bit of my breast under my arm - can't find any glands up though, just the pain and slight redness -I'm so pale skinned that the redness shows up a lot.  Took me ages to get out of bed this morning, I so want to sleep all this away and I can't,....a couple of hours is the best I can do and then I'm awake in the dark on my own - it's a frightening time.
