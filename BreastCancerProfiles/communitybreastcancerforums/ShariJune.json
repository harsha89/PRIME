    "Content": "ShariJune wrote: Hello everyone. I've just discovered this community while looking for some answers to my worries. In October I found that my left nipple was bleeding. GP was amazing and I had an appointment with a specialist within the week. I then had mammogram, scans etc which so far have proved negative. However the bleeding has not stopped at all. I was booked in for a total duct excision at the end of October but was then contacted to say that my diabetes was not well enough controlled to go ahead with the operation. I was also told that as I am morbidly obese and use a CPAP machine it is likely that I will have to have a local rather than a general anaesthetic. I saw the specialist again today and have been told that it would be better to have a general as they prefer not to do this operation under local anaesthetic. My worries are two fold now. Not only am I worried about the results of the operation but I'm also worried that its too great a risk to have an anaesthetic. I can't seem to find anyone who has been in a similar position to me (being obese and using CPAP) who has undergone a general. My mum passed away from breast cancer 18 months ago and a bleeding nipple was her first sign (which she ignored for many months) so I'm getting myself in a bit of a state about it all. Many thanks for taking the time to read this. Shari xx Log in to post a reply",
