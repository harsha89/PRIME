Did you have a BX or is this surgery an excisional BX? You don't know what is in that lump yet. At this point  it can be b9. There was a time when women went into surgery blind and woke up minus their breast and LN's. I had 2 well respected sugeons tell me I needed a mx. THEY WERE PROBERBLY RIGHT. But I did go to a third surgeon(laser) and he was not as aggresive and I chose him to do my surgery. I told him if a LX was not an option to go ahead and do the MX. He did a partial mx and took 8 nodes, got clear margins and 2 years later I'm NED. You need to trust your surgeon and let your wishes be known, writen and verbal. Relax and get rid of that lump, and hope for a B9 outcome............xox",

It was aspirated back then and the Dr told me is was noithinfg to worry about???so I didn't. Later when i started mamo's it never showed up. It was very prominant, close to the surface and the size of a golf ball. but the b9 result I got stayed with me and I never questioned it again. Ignorant. During perimeno at the age of 54ish it started to change. It no longer came and went, it was there all the time and the skin started to dimple, still I ignored it for about 2 years til my pcp peeked at my clevage and told me to check it out. Mamo and BX, and that b9 finding I had 35 years ago gave me confidence til I was dx'ed. I was shocked. I felt stupid and I'm beating myself up everyday and feel I deserve my dx. I should have insisted it be removed or at least examined further .................anyway, remove that lump before it becomes invasive like mine did. I had a partial mast (10 by 8cm) and the cosmetic result is good, considering. i'm happy your being proactive and taking charge of your body. Hind sight sucks. I blame myself, not the mamo's or the drs. Good Luck, Maureen",

But the fatigue persists and is holding me back from normal daily activities. I got my modifinal last week, 200mg, and it does help for about 3-5 hours then I crash...........zzzzztime for a nap. I'm going to start making a better effort to exclude wheat from my diet. It is the logical approach to the fatigue issue. Pasta bread cookies ETC.

I never let it bother me. I did have several mammos but there was never a question about the lump. About 2 years ago I started to go through perimenapause and the lumb appeared and did not go away like it did before.  The skin did dimple and I still assumed it was menapause.  When I went to see my pcp 6 months ago he peeked at my cleavage and noticed the dimpled skin. went for testing. blahblahblah. IDC. path report DCIS. microcal of  IDC, 4.5cm. Most of which was IDCS. or grade 1. The combined total is grade 2. Has it been there a long time. Yes it has. Has it been cancer a  long time? no one knows I believe it was slow growing for a long time. Maybe 10-15 years???????????????????????  My oncodx came back at 28 Much higher than expected. . Intermediate, or the grey zone.",

Then I got into the bagel bus. & started a full line bakery. I was a self taught baker. Very successsful. Sugar was my main ingredient. Not a good place for a diiabetic. I loved that place. I still miss the aroma of the yeast working its magic. PHYSICALLY I was very fit. worked my ass off. Ate shit. The activity kept my health at bay???                I opened a Mediterranian rest after that and the menu was very healthy. Alot of veget. etc. I still ate shit.  I worked very long hours and did not take time to take care of myself. It was all work. Funny thing Now when I have a dinner party and create good food, I can't eat it. I sit and watch my guests enjoy and I just don't eat. A mental thing. Anyhow, I became disabled bout 3 years ago and thats when my diet went off. My glucose levels were out of control. NO ONE TOLD ME SUGAR FED CANCER. I didn't seem to care. As soon as I was DX'ed with the cancer and started to research I made the turn around. Too late????? Yes all the pesticide and chemicals and food choices that the government allows us to be exposed to is a real shame but can we feed the world without  them? Too many people to feed. The hormones that our meat supply is exposed to is the worst IMO  My son who was an athelete has remained a \"heath nut\" has been trying to transform my diet for years, advising me of supplements and food choices. OK Bruce, wheres my cake. He is right. He is my only advocate. My friends still bring me chocolate and BAD food. They are great and I appreciate them. They are learning. No more treats to make me feel better. Now I get flowers and small gifts. They are wonderful. Now if I can only get them to do the dishes and vacume. lol. I have never been angry about my CA dx, but the tx choises really piss me off!!! The only time I shed a tear was before accepting tx via radiation.It s all so toxic.

The first one offered a MX w removal of all LN's(befor the LN bx) the second one said I needed neo chemo and a MX. She ordered the LN bx. I finally settled on a surgeon who felt he can remove the tumor and a small amount of LN. He did! got clear margins and 8  'negative' nodes???? I was thrilled w the final path report. I opted out of chemo (my health is poor due to MS, diabetes, and CFS) I felt the chemo would put me under another foot. I had WB radiation w/o underarm rads due to the neg nodes and I was reluctant to try AI's. The fact that my nodes were clean dispite the possitive bx that concluded at least one was cancer weighed heavily on my mind. Where is it? and where did it go? I went back to the surgeon who found the Poss node looking for an answer. She did an US and lo and behold there it is. it had a clip in it so it was easy to ID. WTF. I'm scheduled for surgery in 3 weeks to remove more LN's. Am I eligable for rads to the LN's after the fact? Can I have chemo 8 months after the PMX? Did the node left behind increase my recuranse score (oncotype is 28)and chance of METS? Is my only hope the AI's? Should I have a MX? Is my sched reduction on the \"good\" breast a waste.

I found a surgeon who said he can do a Lx via co2 laser with oncoplasty. I have a 6\" scar across the top of my breast with a slight indent, for me no biggie. The PS wanted to revise the scar but I had enough surgery and have since covered the scar with a tattoo vine of chili peppers. I had rads and 6 mos. later had a reduction on the other side. A matching set! I am really pleased with the results of the oncoplasty. A 10x10cm chunk removed and if not for the scar it looks really natural.",

Maybe you should shop around for a PS who will give you your D's. If you have a lot of breast tissue left a D cup should be doable. Maybe with implants. Too late for oncoplasty but since you had lx's on both breasts insurance should cover the reductions??? My reduction was covered but it was for balance.

They do their art work with a marker all over the chest and breast and then tell you not to wash it off, UGH. tatoos and positioning. Easy. I wore a blouse that exposed my chest area and had to do some errands afterwards. Got some pretty weird looks. No explanations please. It didn't look like dirt. It is very unattractive. I did wash it off the next day after my tx. I hope they don't need to remark my chest. anyway, I'll PM you.  Maureen",

My tumor was fairly large,  but my breast was realativly large compared to the tumor. Logic told me a mast was over kill. I did have a nipple sparing partial mast.  I hope I made the right decision. The result is good, but lopsided. The right breast is a DDD and the left one is a C. I can't wear a bra but a sports bra works. Sounds vain but the drama of a mast was hard to handle for me. ALL you woman are so brave. I suppose that I may still need the mast  so I may have doubled my pain and time to get rid of the C. The rads have the potential of shriveling the breast like a raisin.

I used to love the beach and tanning.  I remember my first vacation in PuertoRico when I was 18 in the 70's and we met a guy who put iodine and baby oil w/a little water in a spray bottle to inhance his tan.

Show your RO or nurse next time you see them.   Kayce, My urine is also dark. I don't think it is a UTI because i have no pain. But the flow has slowed. I don't drink enough H2O so its proberbly dehydration.   This is starting to suck. I went to the healthfood store and they have no medicinal honey. I found it on line so i'll order it asap HANG IN THERE GIRLS.",

I was really pissed off when they delayed my tx but after reading about all the burns, itching and oozing I'm glad they did. The week off really calmed the skin. A little peeling and a hard nipple and really tan.  I feel for all of you in pain and dealing with the deteriorated skin. I  hope the week off will spare me from that.????????  J-Bug, CONGRATULATIONS on finishing this step.  I hope you heal soon. I want to thank you for reaching out to me!! i may not be hear if it wasn't for your concern and kindness.Feel better soon. Maureen",

Ralston, I hope your not suffering too much, but it sounds like the rads did some real damage. The healing will hopefully start now. I'm pretty much healed already except for the scar area. Hang in there and get everyone to cater to your every wish. (((())))",

Maybe I'll splurge on a slice of cake or even a cocktail in your honor. A great excuse to cheat on my diet. Keep the cancerversity's coming. Lets celebrate each milestone, end of treatment, ned's, or even the start of tx w tamox or AI. Just keep the good news coming so I can eat cake.lol According to my BS, my boob is still a bit swollan from the rads so I have to wait to see a PS for my rt reduction, but it seems the rads are behind me......cake...... I had a BAD day yesterday with fatigue. I took my Metformin before b'fast and started to feel tired and nausiated and had to lay down. I thought my BG was low. the day was wasted. When I went to take my 2nd dose I realized I took a painkiller that morming and not the diabetes med. I blamed the rads for the fatigue. careless. Keep the good news coming.....cake and Jack Daniels. love you all",
