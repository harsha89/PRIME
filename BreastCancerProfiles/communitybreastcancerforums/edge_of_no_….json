Getting the news for bc is a wholly different animal and i'm really gobsmacked to find this specific, bite-sized group of brave, smart, vibrant & witty wimmins. You guys are brilliant! i'll be under my bedcovers,tapping the iGizmo, listening carefully. god bless.",

      "Content": "Jan 13, 2017 11:57PM - edited Jan 14, 2017 12:24AM by edge_of_no_return thank you so much for starting this group. i had the lumpectomy & sentinel node removal 1/6/17; waiting for oncotype test results. was hospitalized twice at the beginning of 2016for suicidal ideation & was just starting to settle down when the dx arrived. i am blown away by all the mothers, wives, sisters, teachers & helpers going thru this who are so incredibly brave and have so much to live for. battling the irrational & shameful desire to end one's life while pretending to be valiantly standing up to the illness is almost laughably absurd. perhaps if i pay attention to the journeys this class of January 2017 is undergoing i'll learn how to love life a little more. god bless all of you.",
