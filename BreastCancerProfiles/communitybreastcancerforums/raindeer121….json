Upon my release they told me the radiologist found a 3mm nodular on my left lung. They said I should request a medical release and have my Dr's review the test. Tried to not worry all weekend but I did. I poked around the Mets IV site looking at signature i was stunned how many woman were node free/clear but had mets. Is this common?",

Even now its not horrible pain my hip or pelvic feels weak or unstable like my bone is brittle.  i do get pain \"flair ups\" . I tried to push it off as getting older (I am turning 37) and I am very active thinking i might be just feeling the woes of an  over and over used body that\u2019s still out of shape from winning the battle with the red devil. Well a few weeks ago I took a fall on my mountain bike and broke my pelvic bone (had a cat scan that found two Olvusion factures). The fall wasn\u2019t awful and it was at low speed so when the ER dr said I had broken my pelvic on the same area where I've been experiencing the hip pain for several months it surprised me and concerned me.    I\u2019ve taken way bigger and harder falls in the past and never broke anything. I received a call yesterday from my primary Dr saying she has contacted my Oncologist to \"consult\" on my hip pain.    I am going in for Xrays this week. When I took the bike fall they only did Cats can for softtissue so Mets wouldn\u2019t show up on the scan (is that true?)  I've read that X-rays don't always show bone mets either.    Guess I am just worried that being I am so young and I didnt have node involvement with my cancer that my Drs. will brush me off.   I am also getting shoulder pain too, which just started this week.   I am not on any hormone treatment, I opted to not take the drug for the side effects.  So the hip discompfort isn't drug related. Would you mind sharing your experiencewith Mets and your DX? My tumor was 1.9cm, with several smaller clusters (5 to be exact) of other cancer tumors.  The largest had vascular involement (not really sure what that means) but no node involvement. I am worried that the Xrays won\u2019t show the mets and myinsurance won\u2019t pay for a bone scan which i guess is much better at early detection.   I am feeling gun shy which I am sure is normal and I don't want to worry that every ache and pain is \"mets\" but I am feeling really uneasy.  Thank you for your time.

Very Much.  I should of clarified my Dr's words.  She said that IF its Mets the chemo plan that she had in mind is off the table and treatment course will change.  Not no treatment. She was implying no treatment till they can further evaluate.   She has opted to hold off on my originally planned Chemo Start Date which was the 16th until she can bring my scans to the Breast Cancer Board/Panel that meets on the 23rd.  She has not said it's mets.  She has said that she and the radiologist are \"concerned\" about what they see on the images as was the radiologist in CT that did my scan as I was visiting friends and landed in the ER with possible blood clot to my leg).  So thats three Dr's so far that were \"concerned\" My Dr is reaching out to the panel for additional review, which I am grateful for.   Sorry I didn't mean for my post to sound so daunting. I am worried and hate the idea of waiting two more weeks for what the panel sees, but really its a good idea to make sure all avenues have been looked at to make sure I am getting the correct kind of chemo.    Thank you for your fierce and protective replies!
