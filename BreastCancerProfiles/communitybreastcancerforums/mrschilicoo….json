It was two months from the time I had surgery to the time I had chemo.  Use those months to rest and relax as much as possible.  My cancer team said that there was very little chance that anything would happen during that time period.  I also had an anxiety attack.  My husband had died in May and I experienced my first (and only) anxiety attack.  When they diagnosed me with cancer in August 2008 I felt it coming on again.  The doctor gave me a prescription for Xanax which is an anti-anxiety drug without the potential side effects of Abiean CR (sp?).  It kept me level and somewhat sane thru the whole 3 months. As a matter of fact I'm still on it but down to 1 per day as I get thru a few other things. Also, I think your statistics may be old.  The cancer survival rate with chemo is much higher than you indicated.  If they gave you that weird chart like they did me, it is poorly explained and skewed. BTW: I also had triple neg. cancer.  Seems that it's the one that almost ALWAYS gets the nod with chemo.  It's done \"just in case\" something escaped into your system.  If your nodes were clear (and it sounds like they were), then the time your taking to heal is a good thing.  I had a lumpectomy due to the size and location (.67 mm and on the lower left breast very near the breast bone).  It was what the cancer team recommended and what my surgeon said he would recommend for his wife or mother.  So that was the route I took.",

In August I was diagnosed with BC.  I had a partial masectomy Sept. 2nd, followed by mammosite radiation ending on October 22nd.  I go in on Monday        Oct. 20th to have a port installed and begin 4 rounds, 21 days apart, of the two compound chemo (T/C?) on October 30th.   Needless to say, this has been a very tough year.    I'm actually okay with losing my hair (at least I am so far), I'm much more concerned about the long term affects to my brain, liver, heart, etc.  And the fact that cancer has, in some ways, postponed my grief.  I dread it coming back when this is over.  I'm finding this whole thing a bit barbaric that the only cure we have for wifes/mothers/daughters is to poison them.  But I'll do what I need to do and be stronger at the end of it for it.  We all will.",
