We now have lesions she can biopsy and I\u2019ve been talking with her about dna sequencing and the like since I am an innovator in my industry and look for this first but she doesn\u2019t seem to move forward Now she wants to go back to IV chemo with a drug called Gemzar. She had her PA call me Friday ar 6:00 to talk with me about it but I did not get to the phone quickly enough so I wait for tomorrow (Monday). I am disappointed the doctor did not call me herself and it almost sounded like this idea was something she thought of brand new after I left her office. The appointment I had with her was basically nothing more than her literally throwing her hands up in the air and said \u201cI would suggest a second opinion\u201d. Tomorrow I am going to call the MD Cancer Center in Houston. We have one here in Phoenix and I want to find out if the one here in Phoenix is just as innovative is the one in Houston. If so, the decision becomes very easy and I get a second opinion right here in Phoenix at MD cancer center. I am annoyed that firstly she didn\u2019t discuss this with me in her office during the appointment even though she knew I was supposed to IV chemo, as the physician she should have still spoken with me about this is an option because apparently the physicians assistant left a message over the phone and said \u201cthis will work\u201d. Secondly I am annoyed that she didn\u2019t call me herself but had her physicians assistant call that I saw once three years ago. You would think that this would be great news and she would want to impart that information to me personally and revel in the wonderfulness of the idea. This is a great way to catharticly move through this. Thank you for your help. ",

Core biopsy on the 2.1 cm mass - no change in size and an FNA on the lymph node. They re-did the entire ultrasound and could not locate the 7 mm mass at all. ?? They only saw it on the MRI. So, the doc said based upon the outcome of the biopsy on the 2.1 cm mass, I would be given the choice of saving the breast in which case she recommended a needle guided biopsy under MRI for the 7mm or a total mx if the 2.1 cm was cancer then the results of 7mm were moot. So I am waiting again until Weds now for my appt with surgeon the the results of today round. P.S. TOTAL PROCEDURES TODAY WERE 100% PAIN FREE in case any of you are waiting for yours.
