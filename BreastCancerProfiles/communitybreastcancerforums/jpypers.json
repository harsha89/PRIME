I did finally call my MO's office and spoke with the nurse who didn't seem concerned about it at all. Said I could investigate with my GP (maybe swab or chest X-ray) but it likely wasn't anything to do with the cancer.",

I have a very similar diagnosis to yours, around the same time as well, except I chose BMX and my Onctotype was 19. Feeling like you don't want to share this with those close to you I definitely understand. I'm tired of sharing my fear and tired of going to the doctor, for tests, etc. I've had a cough and some chest pain/pressure for a while now and feel like I need to wait a little longer before getting it checked. I'm so hyper-aware of how I feel now that I don't want to to call my Oncologist for every little thing, and everything I have had checked out turned out to be nothing. I understand how you feel. :)",
