My hair did not start to come out until after the 2 infusion which would have been around 28 days.  I had really healthy thick hair and it never did all come out, but very close to it.  I do wear a wig for special occasions and scarfs and hats for most of the other times.  But I agree with the others, my head did hurt and itch before it started to come out.",
