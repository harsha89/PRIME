They had to do a lot of work to reach the areas. Used the ultra sound and xray to guide them. It sound like a staple gun when they remove several pieces of solid tissue, the tumor was size of a pea. Three people working on me. After the collection they applied pressure to area for a certain amount of time. Then ice pack. This is standard, for this lab then, pressure and ice they sent me home with ice pack in bra. They did not hurt me even one time was not sore the next day. May you too have a good experience. Of course they called me in a couple of days with the bad news. I already new. The nurse gave it away it the look on her face as they were putting sample in tube. the best to you. stage1",
