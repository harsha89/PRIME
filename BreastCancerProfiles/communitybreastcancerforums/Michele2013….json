At the end of 2013, I was having some heart issues so I was referred to a cardiologist. I had an ultrasound and my ejection fraction was 50. Normal is 55-75. I was put on coreig. Fast forward to October I began getting short of breath and feeling like my heart was beating in my throat and ears. So cardio ordered another ultrasound and now my ejection fraction is 30-35. So next week I will be having a heart MRI. This is what confuses me because I was told it can be reversible at 50. Now there is talk of a defibrillator. Anyone experience this? Michele",

My ro told me to start the aquafor at the beginning, work proactively. Then the itching will come, the hydrocortisone works great. Just make sure if you use the itch cream to use the aquafor in conjunction, due to the drying of the cream. Hugs",

I take high BP meds, so normally with meds it's 130/70. I felt horrible and had a really bad headache. This is all from not drinking enough water and radiation. So embarrassed, should have known better. :)",
