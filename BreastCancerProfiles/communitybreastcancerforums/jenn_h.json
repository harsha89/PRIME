I guess in retrospect I wish I would have asked for a biopsy in the beginning, but I was scared it would hurt (it didn't at all by the way). This is certainly not typical, but just remember you know your body better than anyone else and if only for peace of mind you should at least get a second opinion.",

I finished chemo, had dbl mastectomy and lymph node removal and went on to radiation which I finished oct 2011. A routine Pap smear and ultrasound in November showed enlarged ovaries and this became my first mets. By summer 2012 my lungs and liver and bones were invaded. I have been on xeloda and avastin since, but today got news that 4 biopsies taken from lumps near my skin All over the place were positive. Have to wait to see docs tues and wed so I have no idea where I'll be heading next treatment wise.",

My worst issues are opening things like jars or water bottles (I find pampered chef bottle opener to work great), writing can be difficult. My feet hurt to the point that I cannot go barefoot anymore. I like to wear crocs around the house as they are nice and spongy. Good luck!",

Losing my hair was my biggest worry...seems so silly I know, we have cancer but we are mortified over losing our hair. However let me say that the whole anticipation of it was so much worse than it actually happenening! I have to say now that it is slowly growing back that it really wasn't bad at all...just think, never a bad hair day! It is so nice not to shave too! I had lots of cute hats and some nice scarves (I never wore a wig bc it just wasn't comfortable). If you do lose your hair I highly recommend a Survivor Buff (from the tv show, but they make them not for the show too), very comfortable! You will be amazed how fast the time goes!",

When I speak to anybody about BC or give any advice the first thing I recommend is this site, it has been a lifesaver for me!! I had chemo beginning last Feb, double mastectomy and ax. lymph nodes from one side in June and then the lymph nodes on other side last week. I have to do physical therapy for shoulder movement now and start radiation and then move on to tamoxifin...it's a long road, but it has gone kind of fast for me as I bet it will for you too.Â  Hugs and prayers go out to you during your journey!",

I have copies of all my paper work from my surgeon but I don't see this ER/PR or HER thing on there and don't even know what they mean. I guess my next step is getting the oncologist on board and starting chemo. The doctor has concerns bc the spot in the breast is so small. I am worried about the cancer being somewhere else. There is a wealth of info on here but so much to soak up and I'm so tired! Want to move on and kick this thing! Those of you who have had the chemo, did you all lose your hair (I know, such a silly thing to worry about...but it's there)",
