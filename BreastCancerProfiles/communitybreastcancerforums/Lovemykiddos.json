I saw my PCP yesterday and he felt it for a good amount of time and determined it was scattered fibrous glandular tissue (my breasts are usually very fatty) but he did order an US and a mamogram for me to put my mind at ease. They still have to call me with an appt but I am worried sick! I have no family history of any cancer on either side and I nursed both my kids till they were 9 months old. Just worried sick if they find something horrible Log in to post a reply",
