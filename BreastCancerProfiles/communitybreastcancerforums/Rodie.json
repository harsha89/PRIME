Other than my tumor being 1.5 we are a match. If it wasn't that my daughter is getting married in May this would not be a hard decision--go for it. But, I hate the thought of being hairless and maybe 20 pounds extra packed on. What will your chemo be? Onc. said mine would be A/C--if I decide to go that route. I'm suppose to get back to him tomorrow. I'm leaning toward going for it. My track record since June (diagnosed with Lymphoma) and now bc in Oct. is not the best.",

It took about 1 1/4 hours and recovery about the same time. Took Vicodin as needed. Today I had the bandages/needle removed and I'm set for Wednesday's AC treatment. Regarding blood draws, they took blood yesterday at the hospital and again today for tests. Oh well, what can one do? I understand they won't take blood from port but from veins. It was explained why but can't remember now.",

I'm not having shots--3 week schedule. Last week for treatment #2 I did need a shot because of the anemia. But, yesterday was able to skip it and blood count was okay. Any one have dark cuticles? Mine are turning dark on about 3 nails. I'm taking Nexium now for 10 days and will start again on session #3 because of acid reflux and rawish esophagus. Good news is I'm half done with this stuff!",
