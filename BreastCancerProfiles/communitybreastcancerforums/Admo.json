    "Content": "Oct 14, 2016 07:51PM - edited Oct 14, 2016 08:17PM by Admo I had a lumpectomy and reduction (oncoplasty) on 9/19/16. chloro prep rash started about 1 week later (surgeon thinks it was chlorprep because, as others have mentioned, the rash occurred where the prep was applied - neck, shoulders, chest and stomach). I was given a 5 day course of steroids but it still didn't get go away. I was then given a very strong topical steroid cream to use twice a day but that's also not working. The itchiness is unbearable and I'm now itchy everywhere, arms, legs etc. Dermatologist has me on12 day steroid. Monday is 4 weeks from surgery and 3 weeks From start of rash. Ugh",
