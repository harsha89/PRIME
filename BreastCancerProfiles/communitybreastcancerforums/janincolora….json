My BC dx was 3/17/09.  I had a lumpectomy 3/20 followed by a re-excision on 4/9.  Margins are not terrific, but acceptable.  I am part of a chemo clinical trial of Cytoxan & Taxotere for 4 cycles along with Herceptin weekly.  At completion of 4th cycle (7/10) now have Herceptin every three weeks for balance of a year. I found chemo to be pretty difficult for 4-5 days after each tx, but not much of a problem otherwise.  I have continued to work two jobs (one full-time, one part-time) throughout and intend to do so through rads as well.  We'll see - - - I am 5 weeks post chemo and anxiously looking for any sign of new hair growth. My hair has always grown painfully slow - imagine it won't be any different now",
