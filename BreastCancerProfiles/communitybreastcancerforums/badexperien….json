      "Content": "Dec 20, 2010 10:09PM - edited Aug 20, 2013 03:56PM by badexperience987 Both my surgeon and the radiation oncologist said that there is minimal pain associated with the Savi device. I found that to be untrue. The Savi device inside a small breast does hurt. After a couple of days of having the Savi device inside my breast I was told that my flesh had grown away from the wire whisk type device inside my breast, and since they were unable to readjust it, they told me I would have the old one removed and a new one inserted or the radiation would not be effective. Had they told me it wouldn't be 10-30% effective I would have opted to just leave in the one I already had, but the doctor made it sound as though it would not be 100% effective. I feel I was mislead as I found out later it still would have been partially effective. Let me mention that they charged my insurance company $14,000 for a 10 minute procedure to replace the device. The new device was a size larger and it was extremely painful. And not only when it was inserted, it was constantly painful. I could barely move and sleeping was almost impossible. The pressure on my chest was unbearable and I told them that but they insisted I stay with the treatment. They prescribed strong painkillers and put me on antibiotics. Let me mention that I have a very high tolerance for pain. I get cavities filled without Novocain and have had other surgeries with no pain and heal up really quickly. Not this time. While the radiation itself never hurt, the Savi device inside my breast hurt constantly and it pressed near my chest wall which is extremely painful. I had my treatment in Phoenix, Arizona and am fair skinned. I have small breasts, just a little larger than A cup size. No sooner had they finally removed the device (8 days total including the weekend)that my side near my abdomen started hurting really bad! I got the worst case of painful shingles as a result of the Savi device and radiation. I was literally sick in bed for three months, sick with the nerve pain and skin pain that was excruciating! I was unable to move my body comfortably and even lost my appetite. I thought I might even die. Then, after the fact, the radiation oncologist tells me that, yeah sometimes shingles can result as a side effect from the radiation. It would have been nice to know this upfront. At least then I could have gotten the vaccination beforehand or have made a better decision. Knowing what I know now I would have opted for the mastectomy with reconstruction. Be forewarned that sometime doctors are not fully forthcoming and they only see things from their perspective.",
