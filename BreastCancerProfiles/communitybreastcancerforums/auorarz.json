I was probably the most frustrated with the eyebrows, tried powders and pencils ended up with a combo of both. Within 8wks post Taxol eyebrows were back and stubby eyelashes. I use a product called rapidlash (I have no connection to the product at all) 49.00 compared to 120.00 for Latisse and I think it works , those puppies went from stubby to long in about 4 wks. My PS who told me to try Latisse ( her office sells it) said these products have to be used when lashes are in growth cycle and the chemical within the product sends some signal to the follicles to keep them within that growing cycle ( or something like that!)    I have also tried emu oil on scalp to grow hair and rogaine,3 months post Taxol I have 3/4inch, I d43don't know if that's good or bad...light downy hair came  before Taxol was done.",

I am also triple neg, post bilat mx ( had initial rt lumpectomy but BRCA1 )  and I have bilat expanders about 930cc with alloderm.I am to have 22 treatments to axilla , 6 to chest wall. I had quite a few pos nodes. Crossing my fingers the rad expander side holds up.  My rad onc said I can take supplements but none with extra antioxidents  is anyone else taking supplements? I would love to do the one glass of wine a day as the that study suggested but I am conflicted as I thought we were supposed to stay away from alcohol, I'll check with my doc.   Good Luck to us all for smooth sailing treatments",
