Very few are trained in manual lymph drainage, but you should ask your oncologist if someone in rehab services/physical therapy is trained at your med center.  The massage is time-consuming but often has good results. I can attest....and a properly fitted compression sleeve is a must.  I hope you can press your doctor to get you networked with folks who can help you with the lymphedema...take care.",

Doc wants me to go on tamoxifen and I am terrified of all the side effects and toxicity. Saw her today and she gave me the hard sell and is making me feel like I will die tomorrow if I dont take it! In the meanwhile I have been searching natural alternatives to tamoxifen and Estriol (E2) is being used as a treatment by alternative doctors. your MO will never be on board with this but the theory is that the estridiol is the one that causes BC. If the body has alot of the good estrogen vs the bad, the good estrogen (estriol) will occupy the estrogen receptors similar to tamox without all of the horrible side effects. I have an integrative Doctor that is willing to treat me with this but of course I have my MO in the back of my mind telling me how amazing tamox is. Its all so confusing. All I know is that we deserve to be happy while we are living!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My goodness!!! We dont have to suffer every day just because we had breast cancer!.. There are women on this forum who are on tamox and have a recurrence. there are no guarantees with anything. I for one have had enough toxic substances for now. And another gripe is how they want to ive you another pill if you have a problem or side effect!! Ok yes lets add more side effects to the mix! How is that helping??",
