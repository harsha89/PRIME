There is no fee to stay at a Hope Lodge, but you must live more than 50 miles from your treatment center. Also, many cancer centers that don't have Hope Lodges have made deals with local hotels, my treatment center had both. When the Lodge is full, the overflow is directed to a specific hotel -- the cost of which is predicated on a sliding scale which tops out at around $15-20/night.

There are many lawyers involved and over 2,400 women seeking redress. I\u2019m one of them. I usually hang out in the IBC forum and certainly have no stake as to which lawyer you chose if you have Taxotere induced hair loss. Having said that, after much research into various law firms, I chose Arentz Law. My lawyer, Andrew, has been very responsive. Again, I\u2019m not trying to fish for clients. It\u2019s just that after several sorry experiences with other law firms, I was relieved to find a good one. If you do have hair loss or thinning and you were given Taxotere, please do your own due diligence and join the lawsuit. Drug manufacturers SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO LIE TO US. And that is exactly what the makers of Taxotere did. Having cancer is bad enough, having drug makers put profit ahead of patient wellbeing is outrageous. After 3 years post treatment, my head hair is much, much thinner than it was and my eyebrows, eyelashes, and nasal hair are basically gone which means I now have to use eye drops because I keep getting stuff in my eyes that my eyelashes used keep out. I\u2019m also on meds to control sinus issues I didn\u2019t have prior to treatment. All because I was lied to. There are other, similar drugs to Taxotere that are just as effective. So yes, I\u2019m pissed off. And yes, I want the lawsuit to succeed. I know I\u2019m not likely to receive much recompense, if any. But, by god, people with cancer deserve to be informed of all of the risks and side effects of our treatment. We should not be victimized by profit-driven drug companies that knowingly LIE to us. bride Each friend represents a world in us, a world possibly not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born. ~Anais Nin Dx 12/2/2013, IBC, Stage IIIB, 0/12 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Hormonal Therapy 11/18/2014 Arimidex (anastrozole) Log in to post a reply",

Between your wife's triple negative status and the nature of her tumor, it sounds like her doctors are cautious and are wanting to make sure they eliminate all cancer. That may be the reason that they added on the radiation. I know things are very confusing and scary right now. Try not to panic -- IDC makes up 80% of breast cancers. You might want to call the American Cancer Society (if you are in the US) at 1-800-227-2345 and ask if they can provide you with a cancer navigator. The center that is treating your wife will have social workers who can help you with dealing with the doctors. The social workers can also help you find a second opinion.

The most common is the result of us being told to drink lots and lots of water and NOT telling us that water washes out sodium and potassium. If you've not had further blackouts, I'd suggest going over your labs to see if anything is wonky. Have you gone to http://cancer.ca ? I typed in Quebec and got a list of free transportation, sources of money, and a bunch of other stuff. You might find this useful. I, too, wanted a BMX. However, when I was knocked out for that surgery, my blood pressure fell to 60/40. Woke up to still having both breasts. Given that scare my surgeon didn't want to risk doing a BMX. I was already in a bad state from my sodium misadventure and really didn't want to crash in the OR. So I had a UMX. So far my appearance hasn't been an issue. Like you and Wren, I have PTSD. Mine is evidently well treated because I've had no additional problems during my BC saga. I use my GP (PCP) and my MO has my 2 main docs. Following the excellent advice I received here, I managed to retain some sense of control and have managed to keep my healthcare team on the same page.

For the first couple of days I had constipated diarrhea (??), then three days of nasty joint pain. Followed by a week of endless diarrhea. Worst of it was that I had the attention span of a gnat. Then I felt fine. It wasn't fun by any means, but it's manageable. I had gotten my hair cut short enough so that I could buzz it -- no way was I going to risk stopping up the drains in my old house. Still waiting for the shedding. It was one wild ride, but I believe those who have been through it that it does get less wild.  I realized something that I hope everyone here will come to understand about themselves: we really are strong and more resilient than we know. bride",

Since you also have pain in your extremities, it may not be cancer. But given your family history, the NHS should okay you being thoroughly checked out. I believe there's a really good but private breast clinic if I remember correctly is called Madsen. Having lived in London for a while, I understand how frustrating the NHS is. Please keep us posted.

Having said that, yes, BC can be missed on a mammo although the newer 3D mammos are very sensitive. A biopsy done by a breast radiologist will give you the most clarity. Given your family history and earlier biopsy, your PCP should be able to order one. If you run into problems (and seeing a dermatologist isn't a problem) call the American Cancer Society -- they can help in many, many ways. The best you can do is not assume the worst. Please don't convince yourself it's cancer -- take it one step at a time. brid",

All of them are more common than IBC. So please try to relax. If you do belong to the minority group of IBCers, remember IBC isn't a death sentence. The treatment is rough but it's something you can handle. I did, others did. Don't fall into despair. BCO is here for you and it's a great resource. bride",

But I think all of us would agree that you should keep pushing until you do have a diagnosis - hopefully one the eliminates IBC. If you can afford it, I'd recommend going to a non-NHS doctor.  You've clearly schooled yourself on IBC and I applaud you for doing so. Until IBC is ruled out even as differential DX, you have to hang in there and push for answers. You can win through and get a definitive DX but you may have to tell your GP to sod off and switch docs or go outside the NHS. Having said all that, I hope that this snippet of information might slightly ameliorate some of your fears: in the US, for 2013, over 260,000 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed. Only 11,800 cases of IBC were reported. At least statistically, the odds are in your favor. Wishing good things for you bride",

In my case, I had an ALND and when the three vessels that feed into my nodes were cut, they sort of merged and created a lump that reacts much like a ganglion cyst -- but you can't smack it with a heavy book. So the PT has to harass it until it breaks. Since I have IBC my surgeon wanted to be very thorough and she was. Even though I had a 100% response to chemo, my surgeon took most of my minor chest muscles and in doing so left my pectoral muscle really tight. Still, it is resolving. I checked more on my rad onc's recommendations for dealing with Sjogrens. Not much you probability don't already know: if you're not using a RX mouth rinse, biotene dry mouth rinse is very effective. And watch your eye lubrication, rads, especially in the cooler, dryer weather, can worsen dry eyes. My rad onc also suggests yoga or PT, though she is adamant about balancing that with the fatigue (I've had minimal fatigue).  The other bit to note is that chemo increases your risk for cataracts and that risk increases in the presence of Sjogrens. But basically, she said that rads shouldn't worsen your sjs. Let me know how you're doing, okay? bride",

I had to celebrate the smallest victories; one day yogurt really didn't taste like soured metal. My MO tried everything to ease my discomfort and nothing worked. There were times when I just wanted to walk away from all of it. Thankfully, I didn't and, in fact, had a 100% response to the chemo. You have the right to get the best medicine available. You also have the right to speak with mental health worker. Mine kept me afloat when I was sure I had sunk.  This may the most difficult thing you've had to endure.

I did 16 chemo infusions, then surgery, then 30 rads. I'm still getting Herceptin infusions every 3 weeks. I've had no side effects from the hormonal treatment though I was allergic to Taxotere, the chemo agent and got every known side effect. There can be excellent outcomes to what seems to be the worse possible situation: after my UM, my pathology report came back showing no evidence of disease. Your emotional response is perfectly normal. When you see your MO, ask her for a referral to both a support group and a mental healthcare worker. And, of course, this group is always here for you. Let me give you some advice I was given when I was first DXed. Get a large file and keep copies of every piece of paper you get. I have sections for labs, breast tests, other tests (Petscans, echograms, etc), chemo, rads, etc. I have a separate file for all my insurance stuff. If possible, please take someone with you to your appointments. They can take notes, ask questions, and, generally, ease some of the fear. Also, get a notebook to write down your questions. You wrote that you've had to drop out of college because of this. You might want to check whether you can continue your insurance if you pay the premium. If that's not possible, there are other ways to get help with your medical bills. And don't fret about dropping out of college: I taught college for 30 years and know that eventually going back to finish will not be a big deal. After a year during which I had little time for anything but dealing with my cancer, it still feels unreal at times. Disbelief, anger, fear, and bargaining are part of the emotional response we've all had. Despite all your emotions (mine felt out of control), you can do this. best, bride ",

My RO started me in therapy with a certified lymphedema therapist (CLT) while I was still in rads. I've been told to keep my BMI under 23, be wary of infections in the affected arm, and don't wear any jewelry on the bad side. Anyone who has had either a SLND or an ALND carries some risk of lymphedema forever. But 80% of those at risk don't develop it. Think of it as just another part of your treatment -- one you can have a bit of control over. Assume you will not have lymphedema or a recurrence, do what you can to make that true, and please believe there is no reason why you willhave more bad things happen. You're making it through a very bad thing right now. Yes, it's easy to fall into the slough of despair, but it's a lot more fun to enjoy life and remember the odds for good things are in your favor",

You can get Herceptin as part of your chemo and while you're doing rads. I'm having it as I take Anastrozole, I'm guessing you could take Tamoxifen while on Herceptin as well. Honestly, I'd be more active on the lymphedema-- I started with a CLT while still doing rads. But hopefully you'll not need Herceptin at all. bride",
