ANYWAY.... I have a biopsy on the small lump this coming week and on Friday, I began taking antibiotics for something else. I tried to find the lump this morning and it seems to have almost disappeared. Could it have been a solid ball of infection from nursing? Can't find much on internet. Log in to post a reply",
