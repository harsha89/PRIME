I had wonderful surgeons that were very concerned and made sure I understood everything. They also make sure you are very comfortable before and after surgery. I have 3 small grandchildren and that\u2019s very hard on me to not be able to hold them and love on them but I know if I wanna be here to see them grow up this is a necessary part of that. I hope everything goes well with your surgery and recovery. Prayers definitely going up for you.",

My treatment consisted of lumpectomy with chemo & radiation. That went good and I ha e been cancer free until December 2018. I actually just went in to my doctor for some routine blood work caz I had been feeling drained and thought my thyroid was out of whake. Well she starts asking about my cancer and I\u2019m like yes 11 years. And she\u2019s like so nothing is going on, ? Well actually I just just noticed a lump in my left breast (same breast as cancer was in before) and really didn\u2019t think a lot about it caz I had just had a mammogram in May and it was fine. Well she immediately says it\u2019s full and definitely needs to be checked out. So ultrasound. Mammo. Biopsy. CANCER!!!!!! AGAIN!!!!! I was completely in shock. Of course this time my only option for the left breast is mastectomy so I decided to just go ahead and have both done and reconstruction at the same time. So here I set tonight, 1 week post op with 2 drains out and 2 drains still in. Today has been a very emotional day for me. I guess it\u2019s all just getting a little overwhelming so I got online to look for some help. Anybody that can offer some words of support would be appreciated. I know I should be strong and know what to expect but I let my emotions get the best of me today. I just had to vent some I guess and I know that someone that\u2019s been there can understand so I\u2019m reaching out to y\u2019all. Thanks !!!! Log in to post a reply",

We are going to start my 1st post op injections on Monday if everything goes as planned I appreciate the support and I have a huge support team at home but sometimes it seems like you just need to talk to someone that's actually been where you are. My family has been catering to my every need and my church family makes sure I don't have to worry about food at all. They are all so very caring supportive and loving. They have my back and support my decision completely. I've had my friend taking care of my drains so I don't even have to worry about measuring or \u201cmilking\" them. I'm very thankful to have my support team and now to have this wonderful support system of survivors that can relate to my fears and emotions that I may not even understand at times Thanks again!!!",

They opted to wait another week to start my injections so I\u2019m anxious to see how that goes. My friends and family are all still bringing supper every night so we definitely aren\u2019t going hungry. I\u2019m still sleeping in the recliner but thinking seriously about going to bed tonight ü§ûüèª I got the results from the spot that was found on the mri they did before the mastectomy & turns out it was a 2nd cancer also so therefore I\u2019m headed to see my oncologist next week as well. I\u2019m hoping she doesn\u2019t wanna do chemo again, that was rough the 1st go around. But on a good note they took 5 lymph nodes and they all tested clear so I\u2019m thankful for that. Just wanted to post an update caz y\u2019all are so awesome to give me encouragement. Also I\u2019ve only had 1 more breakdown since my bad day Saturday",
