So far today I have eaten ham, cheese and salad. I'm craving a piece of chocolate or a yoghurt, or even a can of cola. I take it these are not allowed. Any suggestions about what I can eat? Is coffee allowed? I have to fast from midnight. Many thanks. IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Dx IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

That failed and i did navelbine for a while but that did nothing for me so now I'm back on the taxotere and my onc says it should work again. Tamoxifen also caused me to get lots of cysts on my ovaries. I'll find out next week if taxotere is working again. Best of luck with it. Let us know how it goes.",
