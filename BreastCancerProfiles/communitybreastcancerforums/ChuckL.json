I understand about the difference in testing tumors, places in the tumors etc. And I understand genetic testing is far, far from an exact science. Far enough really to be no science. But you did have treatment between the tests. I'm glad you're going with that interpretation and have decided upon a treatment going forward. Please keep us updated. I know you will!!",
