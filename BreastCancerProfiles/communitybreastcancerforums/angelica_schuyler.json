My last MRI at the end of January 2018 came back clean. At the end of September 2018, I felt a lump in my left breast. Gyno thought it was hormonal or a cyst and, as protocol, sent me for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. My appointment was scheduled for two weeks later. About five days before the scan, I noticed pink splotching/mottling on and around the lump site, taking up about 1/5 to 1/4 of my breast. This splotching/mottling fades when I'm exercising or laying down, and becomes darker, purplish, when sitting up. Aside from some slight discomfort under my left armpit, I have no other symptoms: no warmth, dimpling, itching, burning, swelling, nipple changes. I mentioned the redness to the tech when getting my mammo and ultrasound. The tech shrugged it off because the scans looked fine. I called my gyno to mention the redness to her. She said it sounded like bruising or a vascular issue, to leave it be and come in if it didn't get better or got worse in two weeks. Last Wednesday, I saw my dermatologist and pointed out the mottling to her. She, too, leaned toward a vascular issue due to the coldness of the skin on my left breast, the lack of other skin changes, and how the mottling varied from position to position. She offered me a return visit in a month to monitor or a punch biopsy that same day. Knowing I would be worried until I knew for sure, I took the biopsy. I sobbed, and dermo told me not to lose sleep over it, that she would be surprised if there were something bad but that surprises happen and we have to be vigilant. It's been a week since my biopsy. My results aren't due back for another 3-7 days. I'm beside myself with worry, despite the fact that my dermo didn't seem alarmed. She cited my clean mammo/ultrasound, lack of other symptoms, and the way I can make the mottling change with position. Heck, she had to switch the biopsy location because the color of my skin changed in front of her eyes. I'm having a hard time believing her and am terrified that I'm going to find out that I'm dying of IBC. I don't have kids yet. I was planning on marrying my fianc√© next November. I feel like my whole life is on hold while I wait for results. Has anyone else had these symptoms? What was your outcome? Does anyone have any advice? Thank you... Log in to post a reply",
