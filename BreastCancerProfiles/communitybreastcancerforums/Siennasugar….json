My therapist does exercises for stretching, and range of motion. She also massages my back to decrease the tenderness in those areas.Then applies ice to my back,sides, and torso area. It has helped so much with my discomfort, and today my PS removed my last two drains, So happy !!!",

Since I had my drains removed, I have an uncomfortable amount of fluid buildup in my sides & armpit area. My PS wrapped me in ace bandages (uncomfortable). They would not stay. I put on a camisole, and my post -surgical bra over it until my appt Monday. Hopefully they can aspirate some of it. Do you have fluid build-up ?",

I thought I would have a lumpectomy/radiation, and be done with it. The MRI showed other areas affected in the left breast. So I decided on a BMX, sentinel node biopsy, and immediate reconstruction-implants with anterior lat/dorsi flap. I had the surgery on 09/30, and I came home on 10/04 . The compession bra was killing me . I got a camisole with drain pouches by Amoena. It is so soft. Taking Vicodin,( - a little Benadryl for the itching from the Vicodin- ), Antibiotics,(- Zofran for the nausea from the antibiotics- ), and Colace- the constipation is a real issue. The drains are a pain. I have 4. I go to see my PS on Monday 10/07. I hope he removes them.The recovery is miserable, but doable. I have a great support system. I got a call from my BS yesterday saying that they sent the right breast tissue out to a second pathologist because they saw something on that tissue. That was the \"healthy\" breast. People were questioning my decision to remove it. I prayed before that decision. Thank God I listened.",

I had immediate reconstruction (Lat Flap with implants). So the tightness across my chest is really painful right now. Trying to fight this feeling of impatience. I really want to get back to life. This sitting here sucks. I went for a walk yesterday, and it was great to be outside. The swelling in my armpits is super annoying ,though.",
