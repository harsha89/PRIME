AND, the pathology did not come in.  Just thinking about it makes me start to perspire, so I'm done thinking about it as much as I can put it out of my head.... Thanks to all who have been so kind on this thread I feel I've hijacked.  Kleenex, I'm sorry.  I hope the info here has helped you as it has helped me. Hugs to all, Shari",

Everything I know so far about the tumor is in my signature line and derived from my biopsy (vacuum core sampling, not excisional) as well as the mammos, ultrasound, and MRI which preceded the lumpectomy. I don't have an appointment with my suregeon (and, same day, with my oncologist) until a week from yesterday (Monday 9/8).  By that time, the BRCA tests may be in, and decisions on treatment going forward will be made.  Although, tomorrow pathology comes back, and it could mean there's a no-brainer decision to move forward...  So tomorrow I guess I'll know more about the hormone receptors as well as if the fact that the 5 nodes \"appeared clear\" is true... The \"what ifs\" just SUCK right now. So off to work I go tomorrow, glad for the distraction, not looking forward to when the pathology results call may come from the surgeon, how I'll be able to handle the whole thing on my first day, when I'll break the news that I have a few doc appointments I could not reschedule that are coming soon, blah blah blah.  The job is office work, and I'll politely decline to lift cartons of copier paper if asked... So do you wait for the Oncotype score before deciding on treatment?  You're still in pre-decision hell, too? Hope your weekend was enjoyable.  It's nice to be in touch.  Thanks.",

That's my report.  Hope it helps someone out there. Happy weekend! Mel, thanks so much for thinking of me!  Warm wishes and thoughts out to Cathi...",

I'm SO much less stressed now.... Pardon my sarcasm...  Cathi, your strength is inspiring... you all are... Ulla with your studies and successes... Everyone dealing with all you are faced with.  I cried at my computer reading about Sue's cat... felt like it was my heart being ripped out... glad you're back safe and had a great trip and are still kicking bootface arse.  Hugs to all.",
