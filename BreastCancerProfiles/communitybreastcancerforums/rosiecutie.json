I don't think you can predict if Faslodex will work if the others failed, since you don't really ever know exactly why they failed. But I am reasonably sure that sometimes Faslodex will work. More opinions are always better than one. Also now the Ibrance combination, may be tolerated differently than Affinitor. Good luck.",

You can go back on Herceptin plus something else, like Taxol or lapatinib or capecitibine, and then go back to Herceptin alone or Herceptin/Perjeta, but whether that will work in an individual case is just not understood. You can find people with almost any outcome with different agents, and the best thing to do is gather information, talk to the doctors as many times as you need to, and as many as you want, and carefully consider the options. btw, Kadcyla is Herceptin attached to a chemo agent, so in effect the Herceptin is there. There is no data that I've seen looking at the efficacy of Herceptin alone after Kadcyla. You can also try writing to Roche to ask if they have any information. Best of luck.",

I have not seen anywhere that this is a side effect in the official information, but there are a lot of comments on various discussion boards. No idea really why this happened, I haven't had one of these since I was in college! In general, few side effects and blood work was pretty normal after the first round. It is not as tolerable as Herceptin, but not bad at all for me. Good luck!",
