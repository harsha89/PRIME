      "Content": "Snewl wrote: Hi all, Need some opinions on a job offer I have received. I had an axillary node dissection in 1/06 and had to have follow up radiation to the axillary (I think they did boosts also). Right now I work in an office part time and haven't had any (thank God) problems with my right arm. However, I was offered a job working in a large retail store doing merchandising which would involve some lifting during the day. I would only be 2-3 days a week. The man who did the interview said the lifting would involve cases weighing up to 30 lbs, but they could be broken down to weight less. I am concerned about this because I know how easy it is for lymphodema to come on. I woman I know got it just by pulling weeds in her garden this spring. So, as much as I am interested in the job and it seems like a great company, I don't want to do it if it is a risk and I don't want to take the job and then change my mind and put this company in a bind. Thanks for any advice.  Shirley Courage is just fear that has said its prayers. Log in to post a reply",
