Any benefit would be minimal.  One recommends ovarian suppression with the tamoxifen as a preference. Want to do all I can of course but there is no guarantee chemo will even help me.  There does appear to be some benefit to the ovarian suppression as it will stop the hormones.  Anybody doing that? Its a frustrating position to be in because the choice is not clear.  Diagnosis: 9/14/10, Stage II, 2cm, grade 2, ILC, 0 nodes, PR+/ER+/HER-, Onco type 25 Log in to post a reply",
