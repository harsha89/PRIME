Yesterday she was also started on 75mcq of Fentanyl pain patch. So many thoughts cross my mind at this point- yet I have to stay strong. You get to that point when you wonder just how strong you can continue to be. Eager to see what the Tumor Markers were from Yesterday considering we doubled up on the Xeloda, going from 7 days on 7 off to Continous without a break. Hope all is well!!! Log in to post a reply",
