Although I still have a question, do we ask him to refer us to an Oncologist or do we go find one on our own? Does a person have to be referred to an Oncologist?",

We are out here in California with no other family members (although we have another couple and their children who work for the same company who are VERY much like family, praise God)! Still, going through decision making, worrying family members back home and knowing how far to push the surgeon for help is a concern. He somewhat acts as though ADH is not a big deal due to the fact my mom or sister have never had BC, my dad's sister and her daughter both have.  Apparently if all the ingredients are not there I should not worry!!!   Basically the surgeon out here feels if the ADH was removed we should be good, but he also said my breast are sooooooooo hard to read because of the implants and such little breast tissue we would still have to do this every six months. I do not want anything to be worse when we see the surgeon tomorrow but if the BSGI comes back okay, how do surgeons typically react to their patient saying \"not good enough, I want to see an Oncologist\"? I do not want to over react but at the same time I do not want to under react and end up a year down the road with it turning into something else. Does a surgeon have to refer you to an Oncologist?  I have an HMO so I never have to get referrals but I do not know about how all this works really  ",

My implants are behind my muscles and the very little breast tissue I have looks like a pancake against the front of my breast. Starting in June a mammo was done then an ultrasound, MRI, Ultrasound guided biopsy then they removed (1) of three that were suspicious. The path report came back ADH. The surgeon did not feel she got it all and wanted me to see a surgeon when I moved to California (my husband and I move every 12 - 18 months with his job). The new surgeon did an MRI and then an ultrasound finding more suspicious places.  So they did a BSGI yesterday Oct 21st, the tech allowed me to look at the screen and again most of what is seen is my implants and the darker pancaked tissue!!! I see the surgeon Thursday and I am a little concerned, I would love to get some input on questions I need to ask the surgeon.  If they say it looks fine (which I pray) do I still push to see an Oncologist due to the ADH? Do I push to have everything removed so that I do not have to go trough this every six months from now on?  I have read that some women take Tomox for ADH, do I push for this? Really would love some input...... Thank you in advance Blessed Beyond Measure Log in to post a reply",
