Good to hear that you ladies agree. *the mass rests on my pectoral muscle & they nicked it* I have had 2MRI's in the 18 mo, that's actually how we found the mass. I will continue to have them yearly...the doc and my insurance agree that this is the best way to monitor. Again...thank you much for sharing your thoughts and experiences.:) I actually decided to seek the second opinion after visiting these boards and feeling empowered by what I read.",

I'm soon to be 39...my mother was dx with breast cancer the first time at 38...my aunt had it as well and passed away 3yrs ago. I have a complex fibroadenoma (dx through core needle biopsy, 18 mo ago)...that can't be felt and does not show up on mammo. *It is significant in size* I recently sought a second opinion on it...in a larger city with more options and it was decided that my unwanted relationship with this mass needs to come to an end. This mother of 5 will be spending Mother's Day weekend traveling and having surgery. :( What I am most anxious about is the wire being placed with a local and the actual surgery being done with sedation only. *eek!* I'm also wondering what recovery will look like? Any thoughts are sooo appreciated! it's amazing to me how emotionally charged this entire situation is. one day can be outstanding and the next...paralyzing. Log in to post a reply",

The bra advice is also appreciated...they advised buying 2 bras that I can wear: 24hrs day, support but no underwire, with wide straps....ideally not an over the head requiring me to lift my arm to get it on...to be worn for 3 weeks post op. Sounds like a tall order, glad to hear that my choice is important! I do remember the wt of my breast bothering me after the biopsy as well. As far as being put out for surgery...he assures me that the recovery is so much better w/sedation only. I'm trying really hard to trust him. I've been through a lot of medical junk w/my youngest 2.(one has heart disease and has had 6 surgeries including open heart surgery after being in failure. The other was born at 23weeks and has a shunt...he's had 7 surgeries...including 5 revisions) I had my gall bladder removed over the summer & i realized how much I HATE the sterile hospital settings. Ok...I realized w/my kiddos long before that! :) Not lifting my youngest was the hardest part last time...and will be again this time. :( he is 4 but he has CP and is still in a crib requiring much assistance due to his muscle tone & restriction of movement. 3weeks can feel like a long time when it comes to everyday stuff like that...just trying to get creative thinking of how to help him w/o hurting me. :) Thanks again guys....I like the step by step, what it looked like for you.",

Thankfully my insurance finds it necessary and pays 90%. ALSO....before we knew that, my doctor wrote a detailed letter about the importance of having it done...perhaps your insurance would respond well to a letter? Green tree...I would go with your gut on the second opinion. In my case, it made a huge difference...the opinion was quite different, down to the way they monitor me now. All the best!",

It has jagged edges and all the physical characteristics of cancer except that my biopsy came back as a complex fibroadenoma. I'm nearly 40 and have a strong family hx of breast cancer. *my mom x2 and my aunt lost her battle 2yrs ago* I feel like a CRAZY woman. From the very beginning I have wanted this thing out of my body. It rests on my pectoral muscle and the radiologist said it is significant in size. At the time I had a surgeon recommend the \"watch and wait\"...they said that as I get closer to 40 it should begin to shrink. I've just had another MRI *last week* and it is still there...same size. :( I have gone back and forth between wanting it cut out tomorrow and sitting tight being patient...I feel like I'm going mad. I'm suddenly emotional...and having trouble NOT thinking about it. *coming to tears just writing* I can't really talk to my husband about it as A. he worries about me B. he won't understand. To top it off, I was dx with Alopecia 7mo ago...large bald spots on my head. *stress anyone? ;)* I want this mass out of my breast and a head full of hair again. *dang it!* But I'm grateful to get on here and see that MANY of us are in flux...unsure of how to proceed. Thank you for being a sounding board...it is so needed. <3 Log in to post a reply",
