    "Content": "Hla76 wrote: Let me start by introducing myself....I'm a 36 year old mom of 2 amazing boys!!! A few months ago my left breast started hurting. I figured it was nothing. Well it finally got to the point I decided to go see my doctor. She did an exam and thought she felt something so decided it would be best for me to get a mammogram and ultrasound, which I kinda figured. I went last Thursday for them and I thought I'd hear it's just a cyst no worries....nope. Instead after my ultrasound the tech went to get the doctor who came in and said \"let's see what we're dealing with\". She found a 4cm mass deep in my left breast. She gave me the \"I don't think it's anything but I want a biopsy\". Ugh!!! She even went to see if they could do the biopsy right away....they couldn't. I had my biopsy on Friday so now I wait. I keep thinking she wanted the biopsy quick because she thinks it's something. Then I think that they just do it that way for everyone. I'm driving myself crazy!!! The surgeon said the mass was soft and I'm kicking myself for not asking if that was a good thing or not. I should have the results by Wednesday. My biggest fear is being told it is cancer and my husband being out of town this week. Ugh!!! Log in to post a reply",
