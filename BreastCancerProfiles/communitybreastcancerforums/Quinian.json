The doctor after the diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound was extremely forthright with her concerns about what she saw in the images. She sat down with me for quite some time showing me exactly what she saw and where her conclusions were coming from. I am prepared, I think, but just the waiting to be over. That truly is the hardest part. Thank goodness football season started :)",
