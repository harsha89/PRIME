My question is for my selfish research... ABT: 888 are Abbott Laboratories drug that many like Lynne (trip neg) and chemo resistant cancer hope is a breakthrough in research. We are trying to get Lynne into one of these studies; we have one tumor area in her left region attached to the chest wall that is so resistant to chemo..In fact chemo thus far has been a huge disappointment.  Avastin/Exoloda/Ixempra/Taxotere/Taxol/Carbo/AC and others. With Lynne's extensive treatment history since dx 05/07 she may be ineligible for this trial plus the line is a mile long.  I have to plan for our future and Abbott stock is looking good.  If I am not violating any protocols I would like to ask those of you currently on abt:888 how you are doing?  Lynne and I pretty much know now after 4 weeks if a chemo regiment is going to produce positive results. Lynne is actively looking into a new treatment location since leaving Kaiser last month.  We consulted with Rita Mehta UCI, Dr Ho Good Sam/MD Anderson, and have an appointment with COH on the 14th.  Dr Ho will maintain her current chemo, Carbo/Abraxane/Avastin until we get settled. Parp inhibitors probably won't be out in active treatment if successful for 5 or so years.  Any comments on how it's working would be appreciated. Thank you Paul Log in to post a reply",

OK now for your web name.......\"golfer 779\"  I have got that figured out. Golf - you're golfer and love golf 79                  - is 7 (handicap plus 72 par) = 79 = golfer779 I turned 50 this year and was set to play in several senior events in Texas when my wife Lynne received the word of IBC.  So we focus on the important things (LIFE) and I will do the golf later. Good Luck Get Well SOON.... Fellow Golfer Paul ps the kids get me a wider water ski each year",
