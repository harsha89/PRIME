Im 21 years old and I found a lump in my left breast and when I went to have it checked out I wasn't told much of anything. They did an US on the spot and then said I needed to come back right after my next period. I did that and they did another US, and then all my doctor said was that he was referring me to a hospital so a radiologist could look at it. He \"reassured\" me that most breast tumors come back benign, however I did not feel very comforted. I went in for the biopsy and they did another US before the biopsy. The radiologist said he recommended removal, so he didn't even biopsy it that day. I was scheduled for surgery and had a lumpectomy 1 week ago (Oct 2.13). I have been kind of left in the dark, other than the fact that it looks to be a Fibroadenoma. I get results tomorrow when I go in for my follow up. I'm a little nervous. Under the incision, which looks to be healing wonderfully, is a hardened area. I'm hoping this is just scar tissue. Good luck to everyone with their results, appts, etc. I wish you all the best.",
