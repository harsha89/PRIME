And just appreciate what you do have!  ",

I really don't need bloating and weight gain on top of hairloss and boob loss.  This is just so unreal.  I thought being 40 and aging was bad before.  Geesh.... I will be on Cytoxan and Adriamycin.  Because my tumor is so large, 9cm, he said I would be getting it every 2 weeks instead of the usual 3 weeks.  Any advice / warnings?  I did find one post about about those given these drugs, but more info would be appreciated.  I'm so horrified!   Dx 5/7/2009, IBC, Stage IIIC, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
