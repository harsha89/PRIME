IF it is cancer you will know soon enough - so not to worry until you do find out and know for sure, not to waste this precious time thinking it is. 2. AND IF it is, bad news travels fast - shaking up this present time you are now in. Most likely doable - not necessarily untreatable - but you WILL have time to research IF it is your diagnosis. Enjoy now until you hear the words cancer, and even then! Hoping the best for you. I too have been told bc grows slowly.",

I worked while I had RADS, and chemo. I went for my rads on my lunch hour and drove the distance fine, it doesn't take long and they gave me a tub of Aloe to slather on liberally every day I went there. I had tubs of Aloe coming out my ear, I had so many - and slather as much as I could, still had leftovers!!! All these years later I never noticed anything negative about my right lumpectomy side. RADS made me tired more easily, but that improved in time. Fast forward last Feb, dx other breast with DCIS, aggressive with small invasive, - and the option again: Lumpectomy or Mastectomy - if I chose Lumpectomy it would again be protocol for RADS - I chose not to have RADS again, even though it was not horrible, but because there are side effects that you can't see. I had mine all those years ago, who knows if they haven't changed things a bit - but I do know that personally 2 local PS told me that I would have a problem because the skin was radiated (even though I could see no outside problem) with reconstruction after the bmx I chose as my treatment. Then I went to have autologous reconstruction and saw after the surgery that there was a difference in the skin on the right vs the left breast. I have heard of other people in the reconstruction forums who have had problems with the radiated side as well. BUT I had no lymph node involvement - either time. This is your choice, a soft call, just giving you what I have experienced and heard about a side effect if you want to go forward with reconstruction. If I had it to do over again, I would have done the exact same thing I did. Lumpectomy, chemo, rads, and again the bmx with natural reconstruction. I chose not to go through continued lumpectomies with rads and would do the same now. I did have HBOT (hyperbaric oxygen treatments) for 20 sessions 2 hours a day for 4 weeks to build up the Radiated skin on the right side. Hope this helps. There is no easy answer when we ponder these things, but knowing what you may or may not be getting into sometimes helps, or at least I hope so! It's all doable, though, and hoping whatever your choice you have support!",

Or maybe was going to go away anyway - but that itching is horrific!!!! I too took either an ibuprofen or Tylenol thinking the itching is a pain response, but that only worked for a short period of time until I cut back the citric acid. Just a thought.",

I remember being in shock and not thinking this was really happening when I received my diagnosis of DCIS with micro invasion last February. I then gathered as much information as I could from books, from the library, from talking to other people and most especially from this site, breast cancer.org. I went to several plastic surgeons in the Atlanta area and was basically told the same options were available to me. But through my reading I decided that those options were not what I thought was going to be best for myself. My journey led me to have a double mastectomy and also to have natural reconstruction, that may not be your journey but it worked for me. I also started a caring bridge site blog/log so that I could keep up with all the people that I wanted to tell about what was going on in my life without having to repeat it every time I saw somebody that I hadn't seen a little bit. I found I had a lot of well-wishers that truly cared about my next steps. I chose who I wanted to include, very carefully making sure they would be positive. Again this is where my journey led me it may not be where you decide to go, though. My best advice would be to surround yourself with people who care about you. My understanding is DCIS is the best breast cancer to get as far as prognosis. However it still is Cancer and that in itself is something that hits our hearts and our heads pretty hard when we are diagnosed for the first time or even the second. But, it is doable and this site is tremendously helpful with wonderful caring ladies ready to give their time and experience to you. Best wishes for a healthy healing! Hugs",

However the dx this time didn't make me any happier - dx are hard, and I was in shock! I chose bmx because I just didn't want to go through rads, chemo, etc again - and again! I did it before it was time for a new game plan for me. Again,my plan may not be your plan - but good to know why some people chose bmx and why others don't. Hugs",

I had a lumpectomy to begin with then developed DCIS in the other breast years later. Another lumpectomy could have happened, but it seemed prudent to do the mx and get it 'over with'. The lumpectomy breast could have been spared, but seemed also prudent to do a two-for and not have to deal with the mammograms (after my lumpectomy - scar tissue formed and mammograms were very painful and frequent as my first bc was IDC and aggressive). I chose a bmx with reconstruction using my own tissue, because of complications I lost a flap and had to wait until my body healed to have another go at the replacing the failed flap. So in essense, I had one flap/breast and one flat side from May until January. In that time it was a challenge to me to make both sides look the same, the inserts either weighed too much and were painful or too light and traveled in my bra - now remember this is my story which may not be your experience, but wanting to let you hear both sides of it (no pun intended!). I was ever so grateful to have both sides feeling and looking matched when I finally finished my reconstruction. I had complications that usually don't happen to people, so my experience won't be the same in that regard, but I for one was happy that I chose to have a bmx and reconstruction. I was also happy with the lumpectomy except for the mammograms and the times it took wearing a padded bra to hide the defiency in that breast. Hope this helps, no matter what decision you make, when you do, don't look back, only know that you made the right decision for YOU and everyone needs to respect that! So very sorry you have had to join us Hugs Catie",

Then I copied my husband and he was able to send out updates when anything changed. I also did a Caring Bridge site for the more computer savvy people. Yes, it does sound a bit morose, but it doesn't have to be, and there are Caringbridge apps for those with iphones. The good thing about CaringBridge was that when I needed something I just had to put it on there and my needs would be met (I needed a couple of caregivers while I was in a different state in a hospital). I also made my daughter my point person for meals, etc. I absolutely know what you mean about not wanting to talk about it too much or repeat it over and over. What I do now is mostly try to update my 'peeps' before I go to a function so that the function can be fun instead of talking about my progress or lack of it! Works for me, hoping you find one that works for you! Hugs",
