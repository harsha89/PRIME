      "Content": "Robin_Brooke wrote: I finished chemo 12/19/12. About 6 weeks later I began juicing in the hopes of rebuilding my body at the cellular level since that's how it had just been destroyed. Two weeks into juicing I couldn't take the stomach pain any longer and had to stop. My stomach felt like it had ground glass in it. I also had some voiding issues, painful stools, watery, it ran the gamut. I was referred to a GI doc who did a colonoscopy...gave me a dx of IBS, internal and external hemorrhoids, and removed a polyp. Fast forward one year and my flare ups are worse than ever, ironically healthy foods (many fruits and veggies) cause me the most pain, but mild foods can do it too. I'm going back to see my GP tomorrow and I apologize for how long this is, but anyone else have something like this after chemo? I never had stomach problems prior and really don't want to take a rx for this. I'm trying probiotics and a few other things but any suggestions, ideas, thoughts, etc. would be most appreciated!
