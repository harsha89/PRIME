    "Content": "tanfor wrote: Hi, Just a quick post to ask all current users of this board to participate in this poll, so that we may have an idea of the number of active users on this site, and the average length of time they have been using it. There are no right or wrong answers, or judgements to be made, just purely a poll of interest. Please take the time to visit the debate section and answer the 3 simple questions under the heading \"Amount of Active Users and Length of participation.\" cheers, Tanya Log in to post a reply",
