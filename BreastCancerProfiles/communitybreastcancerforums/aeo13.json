I might look into genetic testing though. My mom and older sister had ovarian cancer in their early 30's and then my grandmother on my moms side with the breast cancer. I had to have a hysterectomy at 28 for precancerous cells, so I am freaking out I am just following in genetic footsteps lol. All you ladies are so brave and amazing and I am so glad I found this forum. Again Thank you and I am sorry for rambling lol.",

He then said he was sending me for an Ultrasound since I am under 40 and he said that a mammogram would be good to use right now. I have a family history of breast cancer at a young age, in their 30's. I am totally freaking out and hoping its nothing serious. I have had some tenderness and swelling in that breast, but I thought I was too young. My question is...... Why would he order an Ultrasound? Does it mean he felt something? Or is it just something that routinely is done at this age? I am glad I found this forum because I am having anxiety like crazy. Log in to post a reply",
