I had a lumpectomy on april 30th 2009 and 3 lymph nodes removed which were clean. I than started chemo in july and had 4 rounds of taxotere and cytoxan. I finished in august. I than proceeded to have radiation for 6 weeks starting in october. So now a year has passed I had a petscan which came out fine. I just went for my for my first mammography since I finished treatment and a sonogram and I get a call that they need to do a bilateral contrast mri. I feel like I am having de ja vu. I had the mri last thursday and now I am waiting for the results. Has anyone been throught this same type of routine? I am so scared that the cancer has come back. Is that possible? I read some of tyhe report and it said they found something outside of the scar tissue. which is scaring me to death any advice or anything I would appreciate. I have to wait until tuesday for the results I am going crazy. I can't function. thank you and god bless. Dx 3/23/2009, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I am now just waiting to get a wig from the american cancer society and hopefully my little bit of hair will hang in for a few more days. I have my next treatment on july 9 th. I had like a delayed reaction to the drugs I didnt get sick until this week. I felt a little tired for 2 days but that was it.
