I talk to friends and family about it, I research about it, and I read all of the incredible posts on here and yet I still have never cried. my mom says I'm stoic just like when my dh had a stroke 3 years ago at the age of 40. Maybe it's because I'm a nurse and my mind goes right to the medical side of things. I don't know. I joined a BC support group at my community hospital last week. It meets once a month. There were 6 woman there anywhere from 2-20 years post treatment and 10-40 years older then myself. I thought maybe being with them and away from my family I would be able to let my emotions out, but it didn't happen. The only way I can describe how I feel is numb.",

I have small dense breasts and the mass and therefore incision was below the nipple. The breast itself is still swollen (fullest it's been in years after BFing 5 kids) and the nipple is inverted a lot more then before the surgery. I also have the numbness in the back of my arm and axillary area- nervous to shave! The back of the arm also feels painful if it's touched, like TSB1, it feels sunburned. Another strange sensation I have is when I drink something cold. It feels like the ice cold fluid is filling my breast-it is so cold! It goes away after a few sips. I realize that nerves were cut and are regenerating, but it's such a weird sensation. Anyone else experience this?",

To those starting this week-you can do, we all can!! I agree that we have every right to complain! I still get pain from my lump and SNB and tried telling my younger sister about it. She said, \"that's nothing, when I had my breasts done...\". I was thinking, is she seriously comparing my breast CA to her boob job!!! She also thinks she knows more then me about BC because her friends have friends/family members that went through it. It took everything to bite my tongue. Laughing yoga sounds interesting,but like madismommy, my chest hurts still when I laugh. Looking forward to Date Night with my dh tonight. Going to see Train & Maroon 5 - FRONT ROW! (((Hugs)))",
