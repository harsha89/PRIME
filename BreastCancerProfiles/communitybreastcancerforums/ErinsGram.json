Today she also told me to mix equal amounts of peroxide and water and apply to the raw skin with a cotton ball - I suspect to help it dry out - and then when it's completely dry to apply the cream. I asked her today if this blistering was normal and she said 'Yep!' but when it gets to that point, they need to make a decision to continue or discontinue use of the bolus. They did not use it today and will not use it for my final zap tomorrow. My rad onc is thinking he won't start the boost Friday but instead wait till Monday to give the skin a 3-day break because they do use the bolus with the boosts.",
