So here i sit now, recovering from the additional surgery (and typing one handed - so please excuse :) ).  The risk is this... once its found outside the breast (in nodes) it indicates increased risk of future reoccurances.  Not sure what he meant by it being a possible result of the biopsy.  from what i understand, once it's found in a node, it means some cells escaped from the breast tumor.   It was a tough decision for me. I tried to find research that analysed the risk vs benefit of having the surgery or betting that chemo/radiation would take care of any cancer that may be in any other nodes.  That kind of research just isnt out there. From what i found, the risks of complications has a lot to do with the skill of your surgeon and i have a great one so that helped sway me.  I expect to have some issues and will just have to live with them. Yours is considered a 'micro' and these are often treated differently - less than 2mm not necessarily followed by surgery.  Even seems to be treated differently in different parts of the country.  In the end, the answer to your question is yours alone.  You will get various opinions from different folks and will just have to decide for yourself which risks you can accept and which you cant.   Just remember that lots of us have been right where you are now - worried, confused, and scared... then we bite the bullet and plow ahead.  we cant change what is, only how we deal with it.  Like my mom always says... \"Be strong like a woman\" LOL.  Take the time to get all your questions answered then make decisions that are best for you.  good luck!",
