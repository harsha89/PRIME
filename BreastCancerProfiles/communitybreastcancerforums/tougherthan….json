As annoying as the port is, I was glad to have it during my treatments.  The numbing cream does help (I forgot to put it on one time and I noticed a difference) so glob that shit on about an hour before and you will barely feel a thing. ",

Peppermint or ginger candies, or sour lemon candy to suck on may help, too.  I know it's not in season, but watermelon was refreshing for me to eat and helped me stay hydrated, because water tasted funny, too. Taxol was a piece of cake compared to DD A/C, IMO. Good luck!  I hope you find something that helps w/ the nausea.",

I was diagnosed early, but only because of my own poking and prodding of my body.  I had a baseline mammogram at 37, all ok.  Had another one at 38, also ok.  4 months later I feel a lump high on my chest, near my collarbone.  My thought is that it was there for the last mammogram, but because it was so high, It may not have made it into the compression plates.  I guess theorhetticly (sp?) I could have continued getting mammograms, the tumor would have grown and or spread, and it wouldn't have been \"caught early\".  But because I was aware of my body, the tumor was found by ME and not the mammo.  So my only advise for your daughter is to really know what feels normal in your own body.

Friday I felt a little better, but took a nap in the afternoon,  My sis-in-law came over to give me my Neulasta shot, and that was fine.  I did take a Claritin about an hour before and I plan to take another one today.  So far so good...no bone pain!  This  moring I felt a little nauseous, but after brushing my teeth/tounge, my gag reflex took over and I threw up again!  Unfortuately, I'm very familiar w/ this nausea/vomitting.  With both my pregnancies, I was nauseous around the clock, from moment one through delivery.  BOTH TIMES!  That really sucked!  I was throwing up 4-5 times a week, but my Dr. wouldn't give me any anit-nausea meds b/c I was gaining the minimun amount of weight. So I have to look on the bright side...This will be less time than a pregnancy, and hopefully will lessen as the week goes on (until next tx!).   We'll just have to see what meds will work for me.  My Dr. said for next tx we'll try EMEND.  Has anyone had success with this? and did you also have to take other pills at home/ (Zofran?)

I haven't posted in a while b/c I was feeling so shitty for the first 8 days or so from my AC tx.  Yesterday, I finally started to feel almost normal. Still a touch of nausea (but I can handle that from what I was coming from!)  My Onc will give me EMEND on Thurdsay before 2nd tx, so I'm praying that I have a better week than the first. I normally love my coffee, but couldn't really stomach it until this weekend!  When I tried it last week it tasted so strange!  I don't really like the way water tastes, either, so for now lemonade with a little iced tea mix added seems to be most palatable. I had my head shaved at my wig fitting last Thursday...thought I'd cry, but I didn't.  I actually have a decent head, and look pretty good with a buzz cut!  My wig is so realistic, too.  My kids had no idea it was a wig until several hours later when my husband spilled the beans!  Looks exactly like my old hair. Does anyone feel a little cyborg-ish?  Between buzz haircut, turbo tits, and alien port, I feel like a sexy,  tough-ass, in a way!  So weird!  But I kinda like it! Another question...does anyone know if massages are a no-no when you have/are being treated for cancer?  Massage therapists are always saying that during a massage, your lymphatic system is working harder. So if there is cancer there, should you avoid this?  I will email my onc to see if he's heard of this.  But I am long overdue for a massage, so hopefully it won't be a restriction. I hope you all are finding this Sunday afternoon a pleasant one! Be well. Sherrill",

Yes, the drains are a pain in the ass, and very much a nuisance.  I had them three times as well...two on each side after my BMX, two on the left side after surgery to clean up a huge hematoma, and also after my exchange surgery. (Can't remember if there were 2 or 4 the last time).  Right after my 2nd surgery, I attended my 20 year HS reunion and I wore a regular bra and stuffed the bulbs inside the bra cups.  Some people knew about my cancer diagnosis, but if they didn't, they wouldn't have been able to tell I had just had both breasts removed    Once the drains were removed, I was so much more comfortable.  If your boyfriend helps you strip them, I would suggest as someone else did, and hold the tube tightly near the stitches so incase he pulls too hard, it won't hurt. I know this is all very overwhelming for you.  We've all been there and we're here to help you. Sherrill PS: We have a very similar DX ( I'm from NJ also! )",

As far as the hair thing, I shaved it before it started falling out, and then about day 15 my pubes started falling out first!  Very strange.  Now I'm pretty thin in that region, and beginning yesterday, by stubbies on my head started falling out like crazy!  It's so annoying, b/c these little hairs are all over my neck and they itch.  It's like getting a haircut w/o  the cape.  I took a shower this morning, and they were all over the place.  I just want them all out, so I stuck my head in the sink a little while ago and gave myself a nice \"shampoo\"  to speed up the process.  I hope by the weekend I'll be totally bald Thinking of all of you and hoping you are feeling well Sherrill",
