The tissue expanders seem to shift around a little bit and sometimes they are uncomfortable but changing position or mild stretching helps with that.  I had 400cc's of saline put in each TE at the time of mastectomy.  I haven't had a \"fill\" yet which I've heard can be uncomfortable for a few days.  Other people have had extreme pain from the muscle spasms.  I guess it depends on the individual, the plastic surgeon, etc.  Overall it hasn't been too bad.  Just my experience - I know everyone is different. Best wishes and feel free to PM me if you have other questions.  Melissa",

Evani.  He's amazing and so nice.  He spent almost 2 hours with my husband and I prior to surgery going over all the details. I used a plastic surgeon who is new in Phoenix.  He's extremely good - his name is Lewis Andres, M.D.  I'm 3 1/2 weeks post surgery and haven't had any problems.  I've been very pleased with the care I had at the hospital, and all the follow-up.  If you google Dr. Andres, look at his credentials.  They're impressive and since he's new in Phoenix, he's still building his practice so is interested in taking on new patients.  He did some special training at Mayo in Rochester after his residency specifically for breast reconstruction.  I think he's the only surgeon in Phoenix that does some of the new \"flap\" surgery.   Don't know if your mom is having reconstruction but if so, I would definitely recommend him. Also, Dr. Evani's office staff is wonderful and they coordinated everything.  Your mom's primary care will still likely have to take care of getting the prior authorizations though.   Good luck and best wishes.",
