If thats true then just go on living your life. Your doctor can only give recomendations, it is up to you weather or not oyu follow them. Doctors don't just do biopsy to do them. If they could be 100% of malignancy by using imaging tests, then they would do them at all.There has to be something that looks like cancer. There are B9 things that look like cancer on imaging tests. No Doctor can be sure without the tests. Some woman are super healthy and in tune with their bodies but are still shocked when they get a cancer diagnosis. You can do everything right and still get cancer.",

If it weren't for having it over the last year, I would never have been able to have all tests I have had done. My lumps did not show on US or mammo so I ended up having an MRI. That showed my lumps. If you do get diagnosed with cancer, most states are not legally allowed to drop you when you are too old for your parents insurance. Also there are health care advocate who will find state and federal programs to cover most if not all of your treatment if you cannot afford to pay and do not have insurance. Right now you need to focus on finding out what the problem is and got from there. If it cancer then will be able to deal with it. I had a friend diagnosed with stage 4 leukemia. He and his wife moved from Alaska to Seattle so he could get treatment from SCCA. Their health care advocate got him on disability, found housing for his wife and found programs that covered %100 of his medical bills. He was in the hospital for months and had to be on disability for several years. He only started working again last year. He is now cancer free! He is still on meds and will be for the rest of his life. One of his yearly tests is over 100,000 but the health care advocate found a program that pays for it! If you have cancer there are ways of dealing with it. For right now you need to go to the doctor and get your lump checked so you know how to proceed from here. Don't let money get in the way of your health. Your life is far too important!!!!",

I can go on living in pain with a bleeding breast. To add insult to injury, he just left me in the room. Didn't tell me what I was suppose to do. I got dressed, waited 10 minutes and left.

Because my US kept coming back clear, they said nothing was there,even though we could all feel that there was something there. The only thing that showed my lumps was the MRI. My Doctor said it was up to me if I wanted them removed but he thought they were B9. I wanted them out so he made me an app with a surgeon who was a jerk. He told me I was fine and to \"live with it. Went back to my doc who told me to come back in 6 months. Finally the 6 month wait is almost over and I finally got my insurance company to change my doctor. I go back in in less then 2 weeks. I will probably have to repeat all my tests. I am going to once again try to have them removed. It has been a roller coaster waiting all year. I first went to the doctor last Aug for bloody nipple discharge. I had no idea I had a lump till the doctor told me it was there. I went home that day and did a self breast exam(had been putting in off for several years), which is when I felt it for the first time. There are more then one. I think that there is either a small cyst or an enlarged lympg node in the mist of my lumps. Its the only lump that feels different then the other lumps. Itsreally small and feels like I'm pushing on a pea,everything else is harder, lumpy and irregular in shape.  Don't be sorry about your anxiety. We all get it through this process, especially when we feel like we aren't being listen to. It get to a point sometimes where it just seems to consume you. I like to roller skate to get it all off of my mind or even just turn the music up.I also spend a lot of time on here just talking to people. Find something you can turn to whenthe worry get to be to much and use that.",
