I had DCIS stage 0 , 16 yrs ago & was treated with radiation following lumpectomy. In April, I had a total mastectomy followed by chemo (A,C,T). It was a new primary Stage 3A, E+ P+ Her2 - . I just finished chemo 3 days ago. I will be taking an aromatase inhibitor. My med onc suggested a consult with Rad Onc. Who suggested a full course of radiation to the entire area! He said he consulted with Sloan & Anderson R.Os. I feel like you do; I'm scared of heart damage & more cancer as well as potential side effects. I am supposed to see him again in 2 days, but I'm thinking of canceling . Dear Run4Us, have you learned anymore? If so, please share. Thank you.",
