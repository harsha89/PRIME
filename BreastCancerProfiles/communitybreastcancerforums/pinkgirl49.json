I had a lumpectomy and internal mammosite 1 week 2x radiation in May.  Beginning to feel better especially since I got a clean mammogram last week.  I am still dealing with the arm swelling and pain from lymph node removal.  I go to see my surgeon tomorrow to see what can be done for the swelling and slightly frozen arm.  I probably should have had some PT but I am going to see what I can do now. I modified my home signature will it show now?",
