There's a lot worse things than having to deal with a dent in a breast. No, it's not pretty, they didn't do it for pretty. It's never going to be the same, but it's there.  And if you read thru some of the other posts about surgeries and aftereffects, you'll see that we all feel violated and scarred for life. That a lot of women are just glad they still have a breast in that place. I\"m really glad I still have one, it's smaller and it's funny looking when I lean over or lay on my side, but the only other one who really sees it is my husband and he tends to 'favor' that side, like a wounded pet, sort of. The emotional side is difficult, but again, if you'll spend a little time reading in this site -under the vast list of forums and even larger lists of topics under each one, you'll find that you are in an exclusive group of incredibly supportive and wise women who have been thru or are still or even yet again going through a WHOLE LOT of worse stuff. It will help you put things in perspective. And you'll find that you have choices you can make, or not, and no matter what you choose or how you heal from this, this family will support you. I promise. ~Connie",

Judie, you should consider detective work, thank you for contacting her sister and thanks to the sister that helped this community breathe a collective sigh of relief. Now, I think is a great time to offer spiritual support from each of us in our own way, say a prayer, light a candle, meditate on healing vibes, in Elizabeth's name. She needs the universal support and I know, for sure, that she deserves at least that. And, of course, CAKE as soon as possible. She made me laugh so many times, in the beginning of our friendship in here and she supported me when needed the most. THANK YOU, KK, FOR THE LAUGHS! Your compassion and humor are unique. I'm, very concerned but know that helping hands are ready and waiting to help you. I pray and wish for you to have the strength to survive this episode from hell and come back to us. . . . . . Theres chocolate fudge 7 layer CAKE with your name on it so you have to be the first one to dip a piece into the virtual dark chocolate fountain, in the Grand Ballroom and we won't start without you! With love, Connie",

Damn Medical Doctors for not working with you in a more appropriate manner. I'm pissed off at one of mine. Saw him on the 18th March and he ordered MRIs of both hips. Well, the order finally got to the hospital but its wrong, doesn't specify contrast or not. Doctors office is moving, literally, this weekend. Their old number is disconnected and their new number is not yet posted. I will try to go by their new location, in the hospital, tomorrow and try to find the nurse or the office person and get it straight. Seems like they make it a challenge just to schedule an MRI.

If the radiologist can't see through the scar tissue and the whole purpose of a mammogram is to see through the breast then they should automatically recommend an MRI. Shouldn't they? For Christ's sake, isn't follow up supposed to follow up. this is so frustrating. No Doctor is any longer responsible for our whole-ness. I know I had read that a long time ago and asked for MRI and my BS, former BS, looked at me like I was crazy. Turns out, we think SHE is crazy. sort of anyway. She gave me no options and turns out there should have been options in 2007. She didn't suggest any dietary revisions. She didn't mention side effects, specifically scar tissue and LE. Last year a cyst appeared. She aspirated it and the whole area flared red and warm. It's STILL red there. She knew it was a cyst and that the fluid was b9 but weeks later did a punch biopsy anyway (because it was red) and suggested I may have a \"little\" LE. but she did nothing about it. Now I find that early detection is key to controlling LE and that it is a non curable, lifelong side effect. I'm seeing a new BS on Tuesday and will ask for LE eval. And now, maybe an MRI instead of a mammo that shows blotchy white spaces. I'm going on 4 years out and thought all this breast concern was behind me. Sadly, that's not the case. i wonder if it ever will. ~Connie",
