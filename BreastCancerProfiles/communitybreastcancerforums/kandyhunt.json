I told them I could feel the solution but of course I was \"crazy\" The PS used a different kind and he sewed the new ones in. I also had two big cavities on each side where the boob use to be. The indents were the reason that the expanders flipped or so he thinks. So I now have to to keep my drains in for longer in order to dry everything up in hopes the caves will not come back. I knew they were there because you could see them when I laid down. The PS added saline during surgery and 100 cc yesterday and said I could come in every week as long as I want to in order to catch back up. I really wanted to have replacement surgery done the first week in January. I was hoping I would be doing the exchange surgery in October but that ship sunk. I am feeling pretty good. Knowing what to expect has made this surgery easier. There was not as much pain as when I had the mastectomy. But I am back to sleeping in the recliner. that part sucks. SLL-- I am so glad you are getting your foobs. I can't wait to hear all about it. Michi_ Yeah for foobs being in and it sounding like you are doing well. Readyabout- I was thinking the same thing about if I have anymore issues I will think about going flat. This is crazy. And my primary doctor knows of a place that does tattoo boobs. they look like boobs but are just tattooed on your chest.

Actually you could count on one hand the number of times I slept in my own bed since my first surgery. It is different and I'm not sure about it yet. I feel discouraged at times when I remember how I was not a druggy. I now take all sorts of meds and before my diagnoses I didn't take anything. I was low on Vit D. I read a few articles about it. One of them pointed out the taking a daily dose will not help. It said you needed to take a lot of it over a long period of time to get it up. I took 5 5000mg pills for about a month, Now I take 3 5000. this seems to be the right amount for me. I just had my blood work done yesterday and see my GP next Tuesday.

The nurse said, \"950 so I could go up to 1000 cc\" I guess my face showed my reaction as she started to laugh. But I have also notice that I am feeling like I am getting the sunken chest again. So I was telling my niece that works for me about this and she says, \"Kahli (her sister) and my aunt have this issue. My aunt found out about it when she had a mastectomy last year on her right breast. My niece has known forever because she is very thin and when she lays down you see that her chest in concave. My niece says that they were comparing chests the last time she was out West visiting. So great now that I know this I will pass it on to the PS and hopefully my issues with my expanders will not prove I have that seem concave chest. LOL it would be my luck. Wishing everyone a happy Monday.",

I have plenty of time off available but my big boss keeps sending me emails that only I know the answers to which I don't because I've been out for 3 weeks. I've taken phone calls, signed checks, did payroll, signed a contract. So I haven't exactly been not available. I say all this because I know I will get better but the process sucks. ",

I know it can take time when things don't go exactly prefect. My daughter had breast reduction surgery a few years ago and she ran into all sorts of issues. It took her 3 months to get to where I am right now at 33 days out from surgery. It sucks when things go wrong. ",

It was not as bad as thought it would be. But i still have plenty of room in what I refer to as my empty ravioli shells that are sitting on my chest. My pain is mostly from the nerve issue in my arm caused by the On-Q pain pump used during and after surgery. No one seems to know what to do about it. My emotions have been all over the place. Up, down. But it does seem that when I have a good cry it helps. So I save the ugly cry's for when no one is around. My wounds are healing but I am still sleeping in the recliner. Taking the hormone (Anastrozole) has been good except I started having nightmares. I figured out the taking Melatona and my hormone drug do not mix. About back surgery vs BMX. I have had both. I had better drugs with the back surgery was allowed to stay in the hospital for 5 days and went home with good drugs. It was many years ago and I was much younger. This is worse. The back surgery, the doctor made the choice that I have it. As I did not have feeling from my waist down. I still suffer some from some pain and my bladder does not always work right. I have also passed kidney stones and have had kidney surgery. It was a breeze compared to the BMX. I have also had my right ankle and leg reconstructed with 13 screws and a 6 inch pin. The pain of impact was worse. I remember sitting in the shower and crying every day that I couldn't do it anymore. Not from the pain as much as living in a 3 story house with 2 small children, an abusive husband and told that I could not put any weight on the leg for 8 weeks. I had to move up and down my stairs on my butt as my hubby would not install stair-rails. My leg has healed and I even had a 2nd surgery 8 months later to remove the pin and screws as I am allergic to all metals including titanium. It has been 20 plus years. And still having issue with the bladder. Emotionally the broken leg was worse because of the background crap. The back surgery the same because of the background stuff. both of these surgeries were approximately one year apart. When I was told I had breast cancer I told myself that \"compared to all of the above I've got this\". The husband I have now is sweet, patient and very concerned about taking care of me. I don't even know if truly you can compare one illness or surgery over another. They are all different. I believe that this will be a blimp on my radar screen and I will move on with a story to tell. I am a survivor and believe that \"this too will pass.\" A funny story. I am planning on going up to Maryland to have Vinnie Myers do my tattoo nipples. My daughter told my son of my plans and he is freaking out that his old mom is going to get a tattoo and used CBD by vaping for the pain in the early stages of recovery. My daughters answer to his freaking was to say, \"she has had cancer and could maybe die she can do whatever she wants to make it better.\" Of course, I am going to die but not from breast cancer as my outlook is so wonderful. These are my bio children. We have been through thick and thin together. I pray for each of you in your own journey of this thing we call our new normal. ",

Since I am not allowed to fly according to my doctor.for 12 weeks after surgery. Crazy. This fill has not been too bad. I think I am getting the hang of it. I am working most days at the office. Yesterday I had to meet a handyman so I tool work home so after my fill I went to the house. when the handyman left I went and did a few errands and then went shopping for a few new tops.

I freaked. I told all my surgeons, plastic, breast and the oncologist that the only reason I was doing the BMX was because I was NOT going to do radiation. The oncologist said he understood. I asked what were the percentages of increase in survival if I did it. He said not much. I asked him to tell me what he would tell his mom. He said, I'd tell her to skip radiation unless there was above a 5% increase. So he is going to talk to a radiation oncology specialist and get back to me. I am not doing radiation.

But it is big cancer center so I am lucky that way. Is it your breat surgeon on vacation or the plastic surgeon? And even their whole office is closed? Don't they have another doctor taking their patients. After calling their service you don't get another person that can recommend a calleague.

I don't know how long it will take to schedule the surgery. And how far behind this will make me. My insurance year ends January 15th and I wanted all of this under this years deductible.
