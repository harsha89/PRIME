(My husband says that's all relative! :-) ) I just keep telling myself that this really isn't so bad, and it it's basically 4 weeks of yuck to get an extra edge against this, I'll pay that price. Still no nausea whatsoever, mouth sores have quieted, and I am getting taste back. Tired and need a nap many days, but am back doing fun things like me hammered copper jewelry projects. Pinkjellyrollz, welcome but sorry you need to be here. I am active on just 2 links, Lumpectomy Lounge and this chemo thread. I honestly don't think I could have kept my sanity without the compassionate intelligent women I've met. I don't feel at all isolated, and feel safe to discuss and ask questions. I am older than many of you (just turned 65) and am in awe of what you do. I am super active although retired, and very involved with art groups, classes, and family. But at the end of the day, I can just stretch out and not worry about playing, supporting, feeding, bedtimes, stories, homework, housework, and all the other myriad of responsibilities that go with being a mom or a working mom. We need a volunteer group for moms with bc with women who have been there and maybe could use a hand doing the little things. Some of you who have little ones or no spouse, etc. I'd be happy to pick up prescriptions, groceries, run errands. Maybe I'll look into that when I'm done with treatment. I feel like I'd like to give back, even for all I've already received from this site. Annie, you really are an inspiration! And congrats on your PhD! That is an accomplishment under any circumstances. Hope, it does seem like this is a hard week for many. I wonder if it all follows the progression of the chemo. We're all 1-2 weeks out; maybe the adrenaline we experienced to gear up for the first infusion is beginning to wane. My scalp is getting pretty sensitive so I'm wondering if I'll start shedding soon. I just hate the thought of going in to have my head shaved. People say it's better to be pro-active and feel it is me who is in control of my hair. (yea, right!) I have my scarves and a couple of hats and a wig ready to go. I laugh because my 9 yr old grandson keeps checking out my hair (surreptitiously) whenever he sees me. Kids are so funny. His parents have told him I'll loose my hair, but I think he doesn't want to ask. I really really believe that a positive attitude plays such a huge role in our recovery. I've tried to eliminate anything negative and focus on the future and all I want to do with my life. I've even unfriended a couple of people on FB because they were negative etc. Course, it's not a real convenient philosophy to have during an election year!! LOL. I'm not saying I don't have meltdowns, but I find the minute I start going down that road, I distract myself with something fun. Sorry this is a long post. It's cathartic to share with people who care. Thanks. Hope all the rest of you are having a great Wednesday! Dara",

Mine's still holding on, but my scalp is really sensitive. pinkjellyroll, such awesome pictures! And I think it's great your kids went with you to chemo! My son and DIL came to all my MO appts with me and we laughed because between them, me, my DH, the nurse practitioner, when the MO tried to open the door he could barely come into the room. I really think it helps to have others there, hearing what is said, seeing what goes on, so they can really be there to support you. Yesterday was a really good day. Energy came back (with the exception of a nap in the afternoon,) and I went out shopping for a couple of new scarves, went grocery shopping, and out to lunch with DH. Mouth is still tender, roof of mouth is peeling like when you have burned it, but taste buds returning so I feel more like eating. All else is great. The ladies I went to the jewelry making class with on Saturday are keeping me going finding supplies like torches and materials for us to continue. Meeting friends tomorrow before school starts for them next week. Thinking of everyone starting infusions today. I felt so much relief just knowing I was 1/4 done and knowing what to expect. For me the unknown is always the hardest. It's not fun, but it is doable. We've got this ladies!",

I'm looking for some simple solid colored square silk scarves, kind of the old fashioned ones. I find lots of huge be woven, cotton, printed scarves, but not the old silky soft ones. Anyone find a good place for those? I kept waking up last night thinking there was a bug on my face... nope just loose hairs. (sigh)",

I'll see how it goes with my two synthetic ones and may break down and get a human hair one. I figure with as slow as my hair grows, I\"m looking at a year to 18 months before I can use my own hair. I did buy one online... I think I mentioned the Christie Brinkley one??? Yea, wrong star. It came yesterday and I eagerly opened the box. No Christie Brinkley there, it was more like Tina Turner! I had ordered a medium brown with golden highlights... it was ORANGE and when I tried it on, it stuck up like Tina's used to. And sorry, Proud Mary I am not!!! I cracked up and put it back in the box and will ship it back tomorrow. I think I need to try them on and see the color. I've gotten two at a wig store for about $300 each but they are synthetic. They look pretty good and they are more my regular style so I'm hoping they'll work out ok. Well, I did it today, buzzed the old head. I thought it would be more traumatic, but I sat in the chair and my hairdresser was so sweet and asked if I wanted her to turn me away from the mirror. I said no just go for it. It didn't upset me like I thought it would and afterwards I looked at the hair on the floor and though, boy is that all there was? Then I plopped the wig back on and walked out feeling the same. I think sometimes it's harder for those who love us. I just figured that it's the next step in the process. Hope ajbclan and kz that all continues to go well! Kechla, I'm not sure about the icing so figure I may just suck on ice the whole time. Hope all are having a great day. Dara ",

It feels weird when I don't have anything on it. Also, try using a mouthwash of baking soda and warm water several times a day after infusion. They say it is the very bast to ward off problems. I got both thrush and the chemo sores, and I had my dental appt the week before I started and have gotten teeth cleaned every 4 months for years. I think the chemo just kills off the good bacteria in your mouth and allows the not so good to take over. I do find that my head gets cold at night. I tried a really soft cap I bought, but I find I just can't ave something around my head all the time. I'll do a wig, scarf, or hat during the day, but found at night I need a \"naked\" head. So last night I found a super cute, sexy new sleep look. I had a hand towel nearby and grabbed it and draped it over my head. My DH looked over at me during the night and said he thought I wasn't even in bed because he couldn't see any of me. :-) KZ, I've never felt sick after my infusion. The first SE was the bone pain after Neulasta. Then I got the mouth issues, then fatigue. By day 8 was was heading back to normal. Candy, hope your infusion is going smoothly today. Bebshart, welcome. I'm sure it's very frustrating to have bc back after 14 years. I know there are so many more treatments available now, and hopefully one will control the progression yet again. Kechla, sorry about the veins. I'm hoping mine hold up. They have to do everything in my right hand, so the poor thing looked terrible for the past couple of weeks. I know the drugs are pretty hard on our veins, but I'll try until they can't use them. It's my MO's recommendation also. Keeping fingers crossed for Monday's infusion. Fireheart, got my blow torch and haven't singed off what eyebrows I still have yet! It's a little torch! :-) Hope all else are good this morning.",

I'd read of a couple of you having the allergic reactions to the drugs. The nurse had just started the first drug Taxotere and I started feeling weird. I thought, am I feeling something or not? Then I felt like I was having a heart attack, with a tight band around my chest, and then couldn't breathe, then my head felt like it would explode or erupt with heat, and started coughing madly. I called the nurse immediately who stopped the IV, and ran to get stuff to counteract the reaction. Two other head nurses came in, but I was already feeling better with just stopping the IV. They pushed another bag of steroids and then the MO ordered 10 mg of benadryl. We had to wait 30 minutes before trying again. They pushed it very slowly and I had no reaction and was able to finish both drugs. I don't want anyone to be afraid, I was just so thankful I had read about the symptoms on this thread and could correct it RIGHT AWAY. Otherwise, I might have questioned if it was normal or just my imagination. Lisbeth, my MO said to avoid NSAIDs because they are much harder on the kidneys and when you are on chemo, you don't want anything to add to the harsh chemicals in the kidneys. My MO told me that the SEs I have the first go around, are most likely not going to be worse the rest of the time, but I didn't react last time to the taxotere either. He did say the fatigue is cumulative and will most likely get worse. I'll let you know. I also asked the chemo nose today about the whole immune system deal with chemo. She explained that if you are on a 3 week cycle, the second week after chemo you are at the most vulnerable with catching things. I'm also finding that my blood sugars are high because of the steroids. Nurse had no problems with the IV today, so that's good. I fear getting to the last cycle and them saying I need a picc line or port! I just make sure I'm ready to float away by the time infusion starts! Hope all are also good. Yes, still worried about Lori. Hope she's just busy but doing OK. I see Michelle has started a Sept thread so I think she's doing OK. Good luck this week if you're reading this Michelle. Hope all are doing ok tonight. Just sent my DH to drugstore for Miralax. Last time I started it the first night and need had any problems. Fingers crossed! 'Night, Dara",

Hugs to her! I've recovered from my allergic reaction yesterday, but the headache is just starting and I'm waiting for my Neulasta pod to go off! Such an exciting day! Hair continues to leave every part of my body, but my head is weird. Most is smooth but then there's a pattern where it feels like velvet. I'm waiting for an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe or someone else to appear! lol Ajbclan, I laughed (but felt badly) when I saw the post about your pup. I still remember one year when a cocker we had ate a whole Easter basket of one of the kids. I called the emergency vet and they said to give her straight hydrogen peroxide as she would hate the taste and it would make her throw up immediately. We got it into her mouth but nothing. Called the vet again, they said to give her more. Did it a couple of times, she never threw up and went around licking up the peroxide off the patio! She survived :-) Hope all are doing better today. Yes drink, drink, drink! Especially those of you with little ones, you're my heroes! Speaking of which, has Annie checked in lately? Hope she's doing OK also. So many of us here, I think I miss some people. I keep trying to update the list Michelle sent out. ",

I\"m wondering if the slow release body pod is easier than the regular injection? And it sure was great not to have to drive back the next day! Annie, so very glad you're doing OK. When is your little baby girl due? You are just amazing. Hope, I hope you're feeling better. Bladder infections can be so tiring, and on top of the chemo, you must be exhausted. I've thought of you often today as I was a bit queasy and have had to force fluids. Cali, did you recover from your reaction also? I think anyone who gets benedryl first doesn't have the allergic reactions. Ajbclan, sorry about your daughter's migraines. My SIL's brother had Guillane-Barr Syndrome his first year of college and it was very scary. I know it can have a very long recovery period. Hope everyone else is doing ok. Dara  ",

I understand completely why women try them, and my husband said if I really wanted to we'd buy them (there isn't enough time now to rent). But it looks like we need 5+ gel caps plus order the dry ice, etc. I know I'll lose my hair, but I think the hardest part is that it's a constant reminder of what we are going through.

That was scarier than what was going on in my own body! I am amazed at how low your neutrophil is. I checked my labs before infusion on Monday and mine were actually high -- 18.7. My blood problem yesterday was with lactic acidosis. It can be a symptom of an infection, but also can just be caused by the chemo drugs which is what I expect, and then was exacerbated by dehydration with the diarrhea. Karey, the neulasta is working great. My WBC is doing fine, even yesterday it was in the low normal range. Unfortunately, sometimes there are some other reactions to the drugs and that is what happened. I've read up on the lactic acidosis. It happens when people exercise strenuously and the muscles are deprived of oxygen. I've now watched some videos about using foam rollers to help break down the lactic acid and hopefully avoid the elevated numbers. Then I think I'll ask about something to avoid the intestinal issues next time, although it hit so very fast, I wouldn't have know to take something. It's crazy trying to walk the line between nausea, constipation, and diarrhea. So many people have an easy time, it's important to remember that we all react differently and just be on the lookout should something poke it's ugly head! Anyone doing great barbecues or fun dinners this weekend? I figure I can live vicariously through you! Although my DIL makes the most phenomenously great split pea soup and she's bringing some over this afternoon. It sounds delicious!",

The nurse was so cute and asked what I knew about the drug. I told her and said that I had already taken my Claritin! She was so surprised but very pleased as she said she has had so many patients swear by it with neulasta, but many doctors still pooh-pooh it. I asked her if she know about the pickle juice and she hadn't heard of it... so I enlightened her! Still doing good, just can't keep from yawning this afternoon. No nausea, and just the hint of a headache. Hi Annie Tater, and djm, so glad you're half way through. I didn't have the red devil, but had a similar reaction when the nurse said, OK, here we go. I laughed and said, oh I take it back, I changed my mind! Lorie, hope your good luck continues. Scarysadday, I thought the same this morning when my DH asked how I felt, and I said \"normal,\" I'm not sure that's a good thing... lol. I feel a little weird, like my eyes don't want to focus real clearly. Oh well, not bad at all. Karey, hope the leg cramps don't return. Take care everyone!",

Did you ever check out Wrapunzel.com for even videos on how to tie scarves? I had a terrible time the first time I tried to tie one and thought I looked more like the Taliban! Scary! LOL and then add a face mask to it and I'm really in trouble! Yesterday afternoon felt so much better. At least now I know that the afternoon of the 7th day, I seem to turn a corner and feel more like myself. Kechla, today I woke up with a bad headache. I was told NOT to take any Advil or NSAIDs as they are hard on the kidneys. And Advil is the only thing that really works for me for headaches. I get to a point where I finally will just take 2 Advil and then drink tons of extra water. It's finding the lesser of two evils! I have norco, but just Advil works the best. Hope all aches, pains, and SEs are few and mild today for everyone.",

Not bad so far, didn't sleep well last night again, but I'm now done with the post-infusion steroid. Headache has remained but not gotten any worse. Tastebuds still ok, and queasiness very mild. Several have said hair loss comes around day 17, so I have a little time. Moondust on another thread said the scalp tingles and then gets sensitive right before so you have an idea when it's going to happen. I am quite healthy also, and my MO gave me the option of having the neulasta or not, but warned that if you get even a hint of fever or illness I'd need to come in immediately and they'd put me in the hospital for a day or so to control while counts. With 5 grandkids and the new school year starting, plus, I'm not the type to stay home, I opted for the shot. The nurse yesterday said it helps repair the bone marrow and replace white blood cells. Welcome Melpub, sorry you are in here with us, but very glad you have joined us for support. I'm afraid I'm not much help as I went straight to lumpectomy, but then had to wait around for Oncotype and Prosigna test to come back for my plan. My sister did chemo first prior to mastectomy, and it is usually don't to minimize or shrink tumors which it seems one of yours did. You don't list your dx or treatment plan in the signature lines so not sure if you will do mx or lx. Good luck and keep us posted. I'm hoping all continue to have manageable SEs, and those starting the end of the week have similar experiences. I'm scheduled to take a jewelry making class at our art museum on Saturday and then go to a Vintage Alley sale after that so hope energy et al are good by then. I hear staying super busy, and active helps ward off the SEs even if we think we're too tired. Will ck in again later. Hugs to everyone... Dara",

I guess I'll talk to my MO about how to deal with all intestinal issues. This time I'm still having a quest stomach even this second week. Eyes are watering like crazy this morning. These SEs are nuts. If they'd just stay the same, I could figure out how to address them, but they keep changing. Gee, wonder what the 3rd round will bring? Tomorrow is the first anniversary of my sister's death so my younger sister is coming to visit. We plan to celebrate how incredible she was and do something she loved.... maybe go to a few garage sales! She was an artist and always looked for unique finds. I got to FaceTime with my daughter's children last night. It was crazy as it was bath time and all 3 were in the tub together. I think I've mentioned the issues with one of my grandsons who has disabilities and is struggling in kindergarten placement. Well, things aren't improving yet, and yesterday my daughter had to take the day off and meet with an attorney. It looks like it will be a difficult road ahead! Last night my grandson was so cute and kept signing could he come sleep at my house. Just love them all! Hope your Friday is good.

My MO recommended the TC regimen.\\; I think it seems to have some correlation to a woman's age. You are younger with small children. I just turned 65. I thought from the very beginning that I would just go straight to rads and bypass chemo. I was shocked a week ago when my Prosigna test came back high risk for recurrence. My nodes were all clear, my margins with surgery were clear, and my oncotype was 20. My MO explained that there is a trend away from Staging of cancer and looking harder at the grade. There can be tiny microscopic cells elsewhere in the body and if the grade of tumor cells are higher (mine were grade 2 and 3,) they really recommend chemo. My original tumor was only 1.5 cm, but my MO said it used to be anything over 1 cm got chemo. Now they have better testing available so they can really drill down and get to the actual genomes of the cells, and then mix the \"cocktail\" specific to the cancer. Many people I'm online with have done the TC and all have had hair come back and not horrific SEs. Don't let the scary stories or fear paralyze you. I've had so many many friends and relatives of all ages with bc and there are huge success stories everywhere. I took the approach that I would do whatever I need to do to make it, and even should it come back in the future, the goal is to be around when the new breakthroughs in treatments exist. So far, chemo is not that bad. I know I've only had one infusion, and I know my hair will fall out, but I'm keeping my eye on the end line. Are your girls still young? I have 5 grandkids and I just adore them. My 9 year old grandson came in yesterday and looked at me and said, \"Hi Grandma, so how was chemo?\" I laughed and said \"Just peachy!\" Kids are resilient and they certainly can be a huge help! My sister had stage 4 bc and never lost a nail! 1 or 2 got a little bruised looking, but it's so important to remember that EVERYONE is different, and just because someone experiences something, doesn't mean you will. These sites and women have really gotten my through this whole thing. the threads allow us to ask questions, vent, and feel so supported. I have the best family in the the world, but it's nice to talk about this with ought having them feel overwhelmed. Hang in and come back here often. Whatever you decide, people keep telling me to just embrace the decision and don't second guess or look back. Big hugs going back to you.",

It's to a point where regular reading is really a challenge. Elizabeth, hope the port went smoothly and doesn't cause you discomfort. I think it's smart. I'm still bruised from the elbow down after my trip to the ER. I think when you have to have multiple draws in a day as we do, it's smart to have the port of picc line.

I\"m have such a hard time eating anything with my mouth right now. Last night I tried just sucking on ice chips which were great while I was doing it, but then the pain came right back when I finished them. I will definitely bring ice chips and popsicles for my next infusion. I guess it's like cold capping for the mouth! Even my ears hurt because of my tongue. I see my MO tomorrow so will ask about the magic mouthwash. I've heard of it. I'm hungry, but everything is torture to eat. Lori, I get constipated after surgeries so went ahead and started using Miralax which my pharmacist recommended. I've had no problems at all using that. I'm trying to stay active right now, even if I don't feel like it. Went to a hammered copper jewelry class yesterday at our local art museum.

All of you who are working while doing this are my heroes! Maybe it's good to force yourself to get up and move, but boy you guys are just so strong! Tunegrrl, will you be having a port? It seems you get the metallic taste with the port. I\"m going straight into the vein, so no metallic taste. If you're also getting the Neulasta injection, be sure to start Claritin the morning of the injection to help ward off bone pain.

Jiffrig, my DD really fought to keep him in Carlsbad Unified (north San Diego Co) but the team (up to 32 people at one point!) felt it best to send him to an ASL school since Carlsbad wasn't willing to give him a full time one-on-one signing aide. He can hear with his hearing aids, but cannot communicate except for sign and some garbled speech. He spends 45 minutes on a bus each way to be bussed to Escondido. We all know very well he can be a total handful, with his autism. He is the opposite of what you normally think of as autistic, very outgoing, always wants to be the center of attention, oppositional defiance disorder, etc., etc. But he is also the most loving, sweet, adorable little guy you can imagine. And to think what he went through his first year of life, this teacher just makes my blood boil!. All he keeps signing to me is \"when can I come sleep at your house?\" I know it's going to get ugly, and I just wish I could be of more help to my DD!

The bone pain was debilitating, mouth sores came back also with a vengeance, dizziness was constant, and fatigue is unreal. Maybe the 3rd is the worst, I sure hope the 4th isn't worse! I find the only thing that helps the canker sores is to suck on ice chips. I bought some popsicles, but the flavoring irritates and burns my tongue. My MO had said the fatigue is cumulative, but the other SEs shouldn't be any worse than the first round. NOT! My bone pain is subsiding, but my legs are still so wobbly I can't stand for more than a couple of minutes. Do you have any pain meds? I found norco helped a little even with the mouth pain. My tongue had a deep slit up the middle that was a killer. Hope things ease up, and I agree, try and call your MO and let them know what's going on. I still have two more weeks before my next one. Hope all others are doing ok. I just want to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and pray it's not another oncoming train! Hugs to all, Dara",

The only co-pay I've made so far was my co-pay for my initial diagnostic mammogram. Has anyone found that they are being billed for a high co-pay?",

We're all finding that having access to ice chips (to suck on), bags of ice for hands or feet, and then a number of things listed on the \"Chemo Bag\" list is really helpful. Do you have a port? If so, you may want to try Lori's fix for metallic taste with the pickle juice. (We all laugh, but it does seem to help.) Our dx was just about the same time, but I had only a single lumpectomy.

The \"shedding\" continues today. I've been told to expect the worst around days 15-18. It's also been recommended when you know it's time, go ahead and buzz it so you feel that you're in control instead of the cancer. I'm sure that's not for everyone though. It's important to feel ok with yourself and all your decisions. Only YOU know what's right for you. Caligirl, I took Claritin also for the Neulasta, but I think next tie I'm going to switch to Allegra. I did experience quite a bit of deep bone pain for a couple of days after the injection. My MO said that basically whatever SEs we experience the first time, the only one that may get worse is the fatigue.

Let your MO know as there are meds that may help. For future treatments, people say to try to ice your feet to help with nerve problems. I've had just super short piercing needle feelings but then it goes away very quickly. Unfortunately, just one of our lovely SEs. Your sister sounds like an awesome cook. Especially that potato soup! I think carbs sound most appetizing to me. Problem is my taste buds aren't quite right so nothing has a lot of flavor. Satti, what an incredible company you worked with, and also a tribute to what they thought of you as both an employee and friend! Your infusion sounds so challenging. Hope the pain of it is short. My sister lives in the bay area and Stinson has always been her favorite beach! Kathie, do you get the neulasta pod or injection to help with the WBC? I had an option to get it or not but when my MO kept harping on how if I was around anyone and got sick, they'd have to put me in the hospital. I got the injection and when I went back in a week, my WBC had already rebounded to normal. I have a friend who had bc 17 years ago, went through 2 rounds of chemo and rads and never lost her hair. I think that's pretty unusual though. I get taxotere which I believe is one of the ones that causes hair loss. My MO started out right away saying I'd lose my hair. About 10 days after my first infusion, I started \"shedding\" like crazy and finally gave up and buzzed my head on day 15. I admit that even after 45 yrs of marriage, I was really self conscious of my bald head around my husband, at least until he came home two days later with his own head buzzed! I just love him! I'm really thinking this round of chemo I'm not having as many SEs as the first. I've been at least as tired as the first time, but so far, only mild aches and pains and no intense bone pain. Hope it keeps up! I'm working really hard to ward off any mouth issues also. Isn't watermelon the very best taste???? It's so cold and wet. A neighbor brought over a big tupperware bowl flu and I've devoured it. Kz, I know what you mean about the comments. Sometimes I don't want everyone to be so positive in their responses. I just want them to say, yea, it totally SUCKS! And I hate when someone says, well, I never had that happen, you'll do fine. Everyone is so different, and it's irritating to feel they minimize SEs. I guess maybe I should check out the rant thread! lol. Cali, so sorry about the hair, but sometimes a good cry is just what we need. It's not even the hair (but then again it is) it's just such a constant and visual reminder of what we're going through. So thankful we all have each other here!!! Dara",

I haven't been on meds for it for several years now, but after the steroids with each infusion, my sugars skyrocketed. Twice, the day of tx, they reached over 400! I took some Metformin and started riding my recumbent bike to bring them under 400! Crazy. So sorry about your neuropathy. I'd get sharp stinging sensations in bottom of my feet, but they didn't last but a few seconds, so my MO didn't worry about them. I think plenty of water is critical after the drugs. That really helped with my sugars also. Lyn, I ck'd my results on my blood work, and my neutrophil were actually high 90%+, it was my lymphocytes that was low. Did you get the Neulasta after your infusion? Marlene, people actually responded very positively to my FB post. I just really wanted people to realize that behind every pink ribbon is a real person. I sometimes feel like I'm invisible or don't really exist. I know it's not intentional, and I actually do appreciate all the awareness in October, but I worry that it's so commercialized that people get caught up with the hoopla and then don't want to see the real part.",

I just ordered $130 worth, but love the pouf under cap and all the scarves average $10, so mud cheaper than the stores, even places like Marshalls or Target! As for my allergist, I actually went to my dermatologist as my problem is auto immune with psoriasis. The MO was the one who told me that chemo suppresses the immune system to kill the cancer cells. Allergies spike the immune system to fight the allergens. Hence any like allergies or autoimmune diseases actually improve during chemo. As my sone says \"A silver lining to chemo!\" Sorry about the cold caps. It's why I decided not to even try. I don't think I could have done all that is required to use them. Good luck to others using them though! Annie, there's no way I can afford $2000 for a wig either. I bought one at a wig store in Laguna Beach that has a really good cap under it and they will cut, style etc, even resize it. I thought I was being extravagant paying $400 for it but know that real hair ones are $2000+ The thing is, I finger with as slowly as my hair grows I will need to wear something for about 18 months after I stop chemo. That's a LONG time! Yesterday I wasn't even on this link as I went to visit my daughter and 3 grandchildren for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday. It was so much fun, but then I crashed on the way home. Little ones expect me to play and be the same and I hate to let them think I'm \"sick.\" It just drives home to me what those of you with small children experience every day. I was never so happy to sit and play a game of Uno with my 7 yr old grandson! I had also tried to fix my own hair so I would look pretty much the same, but boy, being outside in the sun, I could feel my scalp burring almost immediately. Are most of you testing low for vitamin D? I'd read that studies are showing most with bc have low vitamin D. KZ, I've had someone with me every single appointment, but I agree with Jiffrig that I almost wish I could go sometimes by myself. My DH won't miss one appt. He's really good, but then I feel badly with him sitting in an uncomfortable chair all day. My son and DIL have gone to the MO appts also. It was like a big ol party the first time and the MO could barely open the door and come into the room! I have just taken the perspective that people want to help and there isn't a lot they can do, so if coming with me to support me helps, then it's OK. Luckily school is now starting and all my kids are teachers so my DH will be the only one coming. I did feel tired afterward, but I know people who even drive themselves. I just have 1 1/4 hr drive so it's nice to have a chauffeur.",

It was super soft and I could jet sleep in that. I went online and order a couple more (I think they were Jockey) but I found it wasn't long and I didn't need them. I really had complete mobility right after surgery, but just watched the restrictions they told me about. And then be prepared that they don't want you to have BP, injections, or blood draws from the arm where the nodes are removed. Some drs are more particular than others about that, but I just don't take the chance. As other on Lumpectomy Lounge mentioned small ice packs (I just used small bags of peas in a baggie) work the very best.

DH and I went down to see my Carlsbad grandkids and our daughter. The kids were so adorable and loving. Even our 8 yr old grandson just kept hugging us. We went to a park and had a great picnic lunch and then stopped for frozen yogurt. Great day all around. Our little guy with all the school issues has another IEP tomorrow. I think they are going to relocate him back to Carlsbad. He won't be in a signing (ASL) school, but should be assigned a signing aide. At this point, I just think it's in his best interest to have a fresh start with a teacher who doesn't hate him! Grrrrr! I plan to stay on this thread, just to check in on those still in treatment or who want to check in. I do frequent Lumpectomy Lounge and people are there on a daily basis for years. It's nice to know that those who helped me though one of the worst times of my life are still connected. I'd also like to help others in the same way I was helped. I honestly don't think I could have made it through chemo without all of you! I laugh at myself because I find myself constantly looking in my magnifying mirror to see if my hair is growing (like 5 times a day lol) I think it may be starting to grow a little, but has these crazy crinkly hairs randomly sticking straight up. So attractive! Hope all have a good week.",

I think for some, the treatment really is worse than the disease, and you just want to have as many good days as possible. All our love is sent to you and your family. Went today and picked up a wig I had ordered. I really like it, but scarves are still the most comfortable. A friend went with me and it was nice to get out. My taste buds have returned for the most part so we went for a great tortilla soup on the way home. So I have another question, I know many people get watery eyes (and runny nose), but do any f you feel like the edges of your eye lids are having mini twitches all the time? I was putting on makeup this morning and could even see it in my magnifying mirror. It's really driving me crazy! Cali, sorry about your granddaughters, but we need to be so careful right now. My MO said the second week after chemo we are at our most vulnerable. Does anyone who get \"D\" take anything to avoid it? After this last episode for me, I'm a bit worried about the next infusion. It's hard to walk the line between constipation and diarrhea. I wonder if it's the taxotere that wipes out our taste buds? I have taxotere and cytoxan. I think I want something, know exactly how it should taste, and then it tastes like dirt. It makes me still hungry because the taste hasn't been satisfied. By day 7 though my taste buds are beginning to come back. I think the baking soda rinses helped this time as I never got any canker sores, just the thrush. KZ, congrats on the blood count! Lori, hope your mom is doing better. Hugs to all else...",

Keeping fingers crossed for minimal SEs there also. Vicki, sure hope today went smoothly and you have little pain. Just remember the ice! Lyn, I did the same with stepping into bras once I moved away from the front close bras. I've had shoulder surgery so tend to pamper the shoulder a bit. Elizabeth, how are your blood counts doing?

I got it after my first treatment, but gagged so badly when I tried it that I haven't been able to use it since! Did you try sucking on ice chips during infusion? I was advised to do that and it helped with the canker sores; I still got thrush, but it only lasted 4 days. And thanks for the Blue Bunny tip! I hadn't heard of the little cups. After my first infusion with all my mouth issues, I did ask my DH to get some rainbow sherbet and it was the best! Leydi, I'll let the others chime in who are on AC. I'm on TC and my MO said that days 7-14 we are most vulnerable. Yesterday was day 12 for me, but I still went out to eat with my sister and then to a movie, but I wore a mask in the theater. That's not too bad since one week ago, I was in an ambulance going to ER for multiple side effects. I'm just really careful (at least as much as I can be.) My 3rd week is when I play the most after treatment. That week is coming up so I'm really looking forward to it. Kz, I'm glad you're OK with your shaved head. I\"m the same. I thought it would bother me a lot, but once it happened, I felt it just wasn't that big of a deal. I'm still not to a point of going out with a naked head, but like everything else, the anticipation was worse than reality! Janet, you've got some pretty strong hair follicles! I started shedding on day 11 and had to buzz it on day 17! I have two wigs now, but find I just can't wear them for very long. The only thing I can handle is scarves because my scalp is still sensitive and anything tight around my head gives me a terrible headache. (I seem to get a lot of headaches anyway.) One positive SE I've had is that all of my psoriasis is gone! I had to quit my medicine for it when I was diagnosed and thought I'd be miserable. But no, one tiny silver lining for this poison. Jiffrig, last week my bp in the ambulance was 85/53. I later asked my daughter how low BP can go. She chuckled and said, well, technically I guess it can go to 0! I did lose consciousness several times. This whole journey is pretty iffy at times. Hope you all have a safe 9/11, such a tragic day. I still remember exactly what I was doing when I saw the towers come down on TV. Take care... Dara  ",

Caligirl, My chemo nurse said that the breathing, chest pain, and flushing is due to the taxol or taxotere. It is common to react on the second infusion because your body recognizes the drug the second infusion and says Oh hell no, I don't like this! She said the most common reaction to the Cytoxan is sinus pressure and head cold symptoms. I was surprised they said I'd be also doing Pepcid. I said I thought that was for stomach and she said it has other advantages as well. Interesting huh? My pod alarm went off last night and the neulasta went in with no problems. Last time I woke up with terrible knee pain. This morning I'm still fine, so either I\"m not reacting yet or the Allegra worked better for me. Sure hope it continues. Still no nausea at all. Have never been sick once since my first infusion. Just a touch of constipation, but I always start right away with Miralax to avoid it. Also rinsing mouth about 5 times a day with baking soda. Again, I'm so thankful for the posts on this site. You all are so great about helping us recognize issues right away and offering things done to help alleviate the problems. I reacted on Monday really quickly, but my ruse had already left the room and was in the restroom, lucking right across the hall so I could see her come out. My DH was with me, but could only hold my hand. If anyone feels weird, be sure to speak up!! Hope all are doing ok today, especially those either having or getting ready for infusions.

My MO saw me 4 weeks after I started it so he could check blood work and see how I was tolerating everything. All was great and all bloodworm had returned to normal. He'll see me again in 2 months and redo bloodworm again, then he said we can stretch things out longer. The fatigue from radiation isn't from blood counts. Not exactly sure why it occurs though. On a happy I'm noticing hair coming in faster and it's finally turning dark. Cali, I've forced myself to wear a wig more now. I found whenever I went out, people were commenting on my scarf... in a good way and they all were trying to be supportive. Some shared that they had been on the same journey etc., etc. I found though that I didn't want to be seen as the \"cancer\" patient and really wanted to feel normal. Cali, I found a light terrycloth cap and then got a wide headband to put around the hairline. I find it's so much more comfortable and feels far more secure. Also, this morning I notices my eyelashes are already beginning to come back. I know I can lose them multiple times, but it's still encouraging. Thinking of you Kelly and JandJ!

I'm thinking maybe my bones are reacting more to the neulasta since I have already had several joint replacements due to psoriatic arthritis. Even during the night, I just had such deep aches in my butt, I had to get up and lay on a heated \"bio-mat\" my BIL gave me. MO gave me norco for the bone pain and I did finally took one last night. Very light-headed also this time, which I didn't get last time. Every time I'd stand up I got dizzy. I'm not sleeping during the day, but frequent;y feel like my eyelids are just too heavy and must keep them closed. So can I rant about something non-bc related? I'm not sure if I've posted that I have 5 incredible grandchildren. One is a love of my life whom my daughter adopted from Ethiopia at age 1. This little guy was lucky to have survived his first year, was malnourished, ill, had ruptured eardrums causing partial deafness, sensory deprivation, and has ultimately been diagnosed with many disabilities all related to the first year of life. He's loving, smart, but quite a challenge. He is now 5 and just started a special day class kindergarten in a signing school to which he is bussed 40 minutes each way. He has so much potential, and he and I have a very special relationship. He'd come and live with me if it was possible. Well, the new teacher, who is supposedly a trained SpecEd professional, hates our little guy. Not exaggerating, the teacher keeps calling saying what problems she has every day, and what possible goals could my daughter have for him? My daughter (also a teacher at high school) asked her if she could identify one positive thing she'd learned about my grandson since the start of the school year. It was dead silence and the teacher finally said she'd need more time. My daughter said fine, and kept her on the spot. The teacher finally said, \"Oh I know, he gets on the bus nicely to go home.\" He's been sad at home, and signing he wants to go to another school because his teacher is not happy with him. After 25 years in education, I just want to go flatten the teacher. This little guy has overcome so much and my DD is 100% his advocate, but shouldn't have to deal with with this, plus worry about me. OK, sorry about the rant.... Just amazes me how insensitive people can be, whether it's with us or with children/people who are different. sigh....",

Just stayed in bed most os the day and took norco. The pain bounced around from knees to shoulder to elbow. Just keep telling myself.... Just 1 more! At east no thrush this time, and (knock on wood) so far my taste buds are still in tact. So I just keep stretching out on my bio-mat on the couch. The heat does seem to help some. Cali, so sorry about the emotional hit this time. It's kind of crazy that each infusion seems to bring a little bit different set of SEs. Smile, all of my tx have been through IV in the back of my hand. Since I only need 4, my MO wanted to try without port. So far, so good. I wonder how some of our early chemo sisters are doing? I imagine it gets tough with all that's going on and then life tends to get in the way as well. Hope all are hanging in!",

This first cycle, I'll go back in to hops for my neulasta shot, but then I think I will request the pod. I have about an hour drive to get there and then 1 1/2 hr drive home. (yuck) I'm also wondering since, at least for this round, I won't have a port so I may not need the pickle juice. Pices, welcome, although sorry you have to be here. I, too had a hard time getting my head around chemo. I was told there was very little chance I'd need chemo, but then a genome test came back high risk, so here I am. We're all here for you, and certainly help each other both get ready for the process and commiserate if there are challenges. Fireheart, I too, decided to forego the caps. It seemed a big time commitment for not guarantee, and then you have to be so delicate with your hair, no blow drying etc., so I figured my hair that remained wouldn't look that great anyway. I ordered a few cute scarves, hat, and had bought a wig when first dx. All ...have a good Saturday, hope all feel OK this weekend.",

But, I think it's part of the \"perks\" of the monthly chemo threads. We're all on the same schedule, just a little before or after one another, so of course several of us start experiencing the SEs together. With each experience though, I find myself saying, OK, this totally sucks, but I can do it. My dad always used the expression, \"That which does not kill us makes us stronger.\" I guess I'll be ultra-strong when I'm done. I just hate that my kids and grandkids see me as sick. They have incredible role models with their parents though with how we care for our parents when something happens. We went through what many of you are going through with my DHs parents. They weren't super close by, but were in a great assisted living group home that could transition all the way to hospice. It's so hard to see those we always thought of as taking care of us, needing help themselves. Today is day 7 post 2nd infusion and I feel pretty good. Mouth is almost back to normal, tongue is still a little sensitive, but no canker sores this time. I think I went through a whole box of baking soda with rinses. A few mild intestinal issues, but no dizziness and haven't passed out since Saturday. (It's the little things that make me happy!!) My head still gets sensitive if I have a cap or something on it. Seq, I know what you mean about a husband's shaved head. I feel the same. My DH did his a couple of days after I did. While I totally appreciate the sentiment, it's a reminder for me, and I almost feel guilty putting on a scarf or wig since he can't (well could, but that would be totally crazy! lol) His hair is growing in quickly while mine is losing even the nubs. I do still have a few eyebrows and my eyelashes. I had one friend who didn't lose her hair to chemo. It was about 17 years ago so she was probably on the older protocol. She sailed through chemo and rads so keeps telling me, \"Well, I didn't have that SE so you won't!\" She's older and has had a hard life with polio so I cut her some slack. Does anyone use massage to help manage SEs? I'm thinking that really might help with the bone aches and pains. I've never been one to get massages other than when I had acupuncture but I feel like I have all this junk in my muscles that needs to be pushed out. My insurance won't cover acupuncture so until I see what sort of bills I have with this, I think I'll skip that. Hope all have a great day today. Don't labor too hard! ",

If it weren't for the bald head, I'd be able to go into denial about bc. But I've gotten used to the wig and get lots of compliments on my hair. The other night I was at a party and saw a former co-worker who didn't know about my dx. She went on and on about how much she liked my hairstyle. I finally laughed and said \"Well, thanks, but I'm actually bald and this is a wig!\" I thought afterwards it probably wasn't a nice thing to say, but oh well... Now it makes me think, oh crap, will my own hair look this good or will I need to wear a wig the rest of my life? lol. When I look back, I\"m with you, Kelly. It sucked going through the treatments, but I could do another one if it was required. We're really strong women and I think attitude is key, which is where this site came into play for me.

I'll ask about both tomorrow. I think taste buds are coming back a little. I could taste the chocolate in my protein shake a while ago. Yea! Hope, just take it one day at a time, and don't assume you'll get the same SEs. I would recommend bringing a thermos of ice chips though and sucking on those. Mouth problems suck!",

I thought at first your friend was your daughter (or sister:-) ) This last chemo, I was actually in one of the recliners, and found it so much more comfortable! Your day sounds really special and surrounded by people you love. Sorry I haven't been supporting all the way I wish I could have. Usually I am able to sit in my chair and have my laptop right next to me. Something will peak my interest and I'll even google, say what movies or show a certain actor was in. Well, since Wednesday, I've been pretty much probed out in bed and sleeping. SEs hit earlier this time, but at least I can tell myself that it's the last time for all (hopefully) except some fatigue. This time, every joint was so fatigued I couldn't even hold my cell phone, let alone type. I'd try to walk around the house, and my legs would give out, and dizziness hit when I'd stand. Today is getting a bit better. And the great thing is my mouth is improving very quickly. I got the white yuck on Thursday, but it's already going away and taste coming back. I had made a big pot of chicken corn chowder with bacon on Tuesday while I still felt ok (I know sounds really bad for me doesn't it!) but it was one of the few things I could still taste. That and rocky road ice cream! lol) I've been lucky in that my weight has remained the same since dx. I had been so good at first, eating organic, healthy, and no sweets, but then chemo hit! I have my RO consult on Oct. 26 and then will see my MO on Nov. 7 to start AIs while on rads. Fireheart, so nice to see you back again. I thinks e should all make a pact that no apologies are necessary for any absences, vents, rants, or fears. It's hard to live with this day to day and not be able to ever get away from it, especially when we look in the mirror! Someone mentioned about the neulasta ad and it's really been ticking me off lately. Couldn't they at least put her in a scarf or something? I've really gotten to hate the look of my bald body! I noticed a young woman in chemo with her nude head and she looked so beautiful! She just had the best shaped head and really looked good! I have a flat head in the back have a couple of really weird gray hairs growing on the side of my head... but only about 3! What's up with that???? Kelly and Marlene, we understand the fear about metastatic c. All of us, no matter what stage we're originally dx'd with, know that nothing is 100%. We learn to live a new normal life, but in the way back of our minds, we know there's a chance.... It surprises me when I hear about BC Survivors, because I worry that we never completely \"survive\" bc but have to stay vigilant that it doesn't come back. And if it does, we just hit it back down again. My sister used to call it \"Whack a Mole\" (remember that game at Chuck E Cheese?) I just know all the new drugs, studies, etc. that have come about and know that this battle will be won in the future. We can do this all... especially with all of your support! Love you all! Dara ",

Today I had an appt with MO to check how I'm doing, blood counts etc. All really good news. My white blood counts have completely rebounded after just a week thanks to the neulasta injection. I'm now 7 days out, and woke up today feeling like I was hit by a truck. No nausea or actual pain, just couldn't lift my arms or hold my head up. MO said that's completely normal and the worst should be behind me for this cycle. I talked to them about my mouth issues and got 2 prescriptions for that. One is the magic mouthwash, that they even call that in bc books. It's prescription, Kenzielulu, and when I got home I tried it. OMG! Gagged immediately because it tasted solo bad, but immediately numbed my whole mouth. Yea! Seems I'm lucky enough to get both mouth reactions, thrush, and reaction of chemo with canker sores. It's much better today and I was actually able to eat 1/2 rotisserie chicken sandwich on super soft bread. I've dropped almost 6 pound, but really can't afford to lose very much more. The PA said I need to eat, even if I can't taste anything or feel like eating. I'm still drinking lots and don't have problems with that. And I wouldn't stress about the margarita... I've had 2 since diagnosis. My MO said once in a while won't hurt us. I know what is meant by taking our hair into our own hands. This morning, I was almost wishing I was bald as I struggled to get dressed and ix my hair for dr appt. I just didn't have the energy for it. Tunegrrl, I don't have a port or picc line. My MO suggested I try it just straight into the vein and see how I do. I just really hydrated before and had no problems at all. I didn't even get a bruise, and I bruise super easy. Hope all are having a good start to the week. I know the anticipation for those started this week is high. I agree, it was no where near what I thought it would be.

I went on and found one that looks like my haircut and it can even take a blow dryer or flatiron. I find my scalp is getting a little tingly at the very top, but I wonder if I'm just imagining it???

The head teacher reported that they all believe that Camden is extremely smart, since January he has learned all the letters of the alphabet, learned their sounds in a week and a half, and has completely mastered all the sight words his classmates learned since September. They feel that in many ways he is more advanced than even regular grade level kids, needs to be in a transitional autistic 1st grade class next year. (My DD thought he would need to repeat K to try to catch up.) I've been learning sign language and he signs fluently and was so cute teaching me some words I didn't know! So I'm exhausted, slept 12 hours last night, and am still in my pajamas this morning! But I thought you'd like to see him again.

Re taxotere, my MO said the risk of permanent hair loss is super low (I read 3%) but the reason he chose it was that it is the least likely (at this time) to have any long term heart side effects. My onco score was 20 and I had still decided to forego chemo until my MO did another test, Prosigna, which is specifically for detraining genomes of cancers in the intermediate onco range. It came back high risk, so here I am. Is your MO doing a Mammoprint or other test to help define exactly which treatment is best?",

I go bald around the house, but when I go out it's usually in a scarf. I think I need to start wearing a wig more to just get used to it. It feels uncomfortable and I can't wait to pull it off. I hope others don't feel I'm betraying them. I haven't seen anyone going bald so I feel more comfortable when out or with people to wear something. Yesterday I panicked because I was stretched out on the couch (bald) and the doorbell rang. I grabbed for my scarf which already had a tie in it and quickly tried to pull it on without even a mirror. If it were a neighbor, I couldn't answer the door nude! Anyway, by the time I got to the door, someone was walking down the driveway with a clipboard in hand. We live on a private street with no solicitations allowed, but once in a while it still happens. I think the best thing is to be honest about who we are. I've never gone out without hair done, makeup on etc. That's been me since I was 2 years old. We lived in Connecticut and in the winter my mom would let me play on the front porch and she put me in overalls. She said I sat in a corner and cried until she brought me in and put me in a dress. I'm not a fanatic, but I still like to feel like me, so I still put on makeup, including painting on eyebrows blush, etc. If someone is natural and beautiful, more power to her! I guess at this point in my life, I'm more about accepting and thinking positive thoughts about people. We never know all the background behind their decisions and they are their decisions.

I go to the studio (about 1/2 hour away) 3-4 times a week. It really is both a social and productive time for me. I'm learning about new glazes and techniques and just having fun. Annie, I too have to get back to being better about eating healthy. It's not that I'm eating unhealthy, but I do eat more carbs than I should. I had done so well maintaining weight throughout chemo, but now on the estrogen blockers (and my poor will power) I've put on about 15 pounds. That definitely needs to come off. I've read so much about the effect of weight on cancer. You all are in my thoughts daily and I'm glad we're all on the \"other side\" of treatment now. But I also know as those first test roll around (and the second and third) nerves get rattled. Hang in. We're all (or many) still here for you! (Sorry about all the parenthesis! LOL. I'm in one of those moods :-) )",

I'm constantly struck, at the hospital, out shopping, and certainly here on this site, just how many of us are fighting the same fight. I just love though the people who are years out and still here posting, supporting, and encouraging! Thank you all! Yesterday I realized that my positive attitude had a little bit of a crack in it. I was out shopping and it was so nice because I realized that no one knew I have bc. Then I got back to the car, got a phone call, and while putting my hand through my hair, realized it is not coming out in clumps. I know no one wants to lose their hair, and it REALLY isn't that we are vain, I thought, no one knew today in the store that I have cancer, but the minute the scarf, the wig, or the hat goes on things change. I have a little birthday party tomorrow for my granddaughter who turns 2 and I really wanted to look normal for that. Not sure if I will wear my wig or try to fix my hair, but will probably go in to hairdresser and get it buzzed on Tuesday. Lisbeth and abjclan, I've tried the hat with halo, but didn't get it. I thought I looked silly. I bought a pretty good wig, but then I found some cute and much less expensive ones that are Christie Brinkley wigs. I'm sure I'll look JUST like Christie when I put one on!!! :-) LOL. My sister told me that sometimes she just wanted to not feel sick so she would put a wig on. It's hard this time of year though as it's still really hot here for at least another 6 weeks or so, and I fear the wig will itch or be hot. I haven't been able to find many smaller scarves lately so yesterday went to the fabric store and bought a couple of yards of soft thin fabric that I could use as head scarves. The pretty scarves I've found are super big and I'd have to wrap it several times around my head. I could stick fruit in it and dance around with castanets. Yesterday I was also SUPER BAD about diet. I rarely get depressed so to totally lift my spirits, I stopped at a wonderful bakery and had the biggest piece of chocolate mousse cake you've ever seen. And I sat down at a little table and ate every single bite! It was awesome. And then came home and had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for dinner! I've really been doing a lot of vegetarian, organic, healthy food, and couldn't believe what I did. Getting back to normal today, but it sure was good! Pinkjellyroll, Hope, Sherri, hope you're beginning to come out of the first week yuck with chemo. It took me 7 days and then really have felt good after that. I get tired at night, but nothing worse. To those starting this week, just remember, you've got this!",

I don't think it's the letrozole, but who knows. My right hip has been replaced twice and while it's not wearing the way it should, the dr can't tell if I have bursitis, psoriatic arthritis in it, or if the muscle has pulled away from the bone.

He said those protect cells, and while on chemo our bodies can't differentiate between good cells and cancer cells. Hence we don't want any cancer cells to be protected from the chemo. And of course drink as much water as possible to keep kidneys flushed. I read in one book that we should drink a minimum of 100 oz per day. Water tastes a little weird to me, so I add a tiny bit of raspberry crystal light to take the yuck out of it. Fireheart, Good luck on your first day! Are you at an elementary or high school? I taught high school for 17 years and then went into administration. The kids (even hs) were always coming up and coughing in my face, so cute! I loved the classroom but never had all the devices they have now. Technology has really changed so much in education and I think it's great. Our kids are so comfortable with it. My 2 yr old granddaughter, before she could even talk, could take my iPhone and knew how to get to her special apps to play games. Could you ever wear think latex gloves? Lisbeth, so sorry about the insurance. I get so frustrated with insurance, and especially the prescription part. I really have not paid for anything yet other than my first diagnostic mammogram, and just pray I don't get hit with some huge bill once everything catches up with billing and insurance. I think I mentioned that I looked up what the Neulasta shot most of us get would cost without insurance. Just the one injection would be $5000+. One drug I was taking, Otezla, isn't covered now that I changed insurance. It would be $2,645 PER MONTH out of pocket! Something needs to give. These products can't possibly cost that much to make. Candy and Mom, be sure to suck on some ice chips during chemo, just as a safeguard for mouth issues. I didn't and got both thrush and canker sores, plus totally lost all tastebuds for about 5-6 days. They came back, but others who used the chips said they had no problems. My 2nd infusion is Monday and I will bring a good supply of ice chips in a thermos! ajbclan and Kz, thinking of you today and want to hear all about your day and as you move into the days after. Hope any SEs are minimal. Caligirl, hope you get the heartbeat under control quickly. Yea, Michelle, so technically you're still in the August chemo group since you are sort of beginning the process at the end of the month. Lori, everything OK? Maybe I missed a couple of posts but haven't heard from you for a bit. Hope you're able to enjoy days now. Hi to everyone else. I'm thinking of everyone. This morning I'm off to my hairdresser to get my head buzzed! I'm tired of leaving a trail of hair wherever I go! Just need to jump in and embrace this!!! Love you all.

The breast portion of the surgery really didn't cause me much pain at all, just a little discomfort. The incision for the nodes was bigger and caused some discomfort, but I took pain meds the first day after surgery and lots of ice, and then just iced constantly. The week after surgery, I even took a 3 day photography class where we were out climbing down in a gully to photograph silhouettes . By the end of the evening, I was a bit sore in my arm pit from holding my camera in close to my body. Most everyone says the lymph node surgery causes more discomfort than the breast so just do your exercises you're given (they want you to start the very next day with some small stretches) and plan on just icing every few hours. I know some have issues, but personally I have done super well with it. I have had quite a few orthopedic surgeries over the last years, and know I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, but most feel the lx is not that bad. Your tumor is about the same size as mine was, so my surgeon didn't use a drain afterwards or anything like that. They start with the sentinel node, and if that is clear, my bs said they stop there. They wound up removing 5 nodes (some get kind of clumped together, and now I am just careful and don't let medicals take BP or blood from that arm. I do have a medic alert bracelet in case I'm not able to tell them about the node issue. And now I can barely see the scars (not that I care about 2 more scars lol) My tumor was right smack in the front of my breast, right above the nipple area, so I have a thin about 2\" scar. My bs said that will fade quite a bit after rads. Drop in to the Lumpectomy Lounge; there are several bc sisters who have just had surgery. Surgery is absolutely NOTHING compared to chemo!!! You've got this. Big hugs!",

So sorry for that added bonus! ajbclan, I actually took a picture of my tongue and showed it to my MO NP. She looked at it and said, yep you have thrush. It comes from the chemo killing off the good bacteria in your mouth, similar to post antibiotic if you've ever had a yeast infection. My MO said to use biotin or salt and warm water rinses and also baking soda and warm water rinses up to 8 times a day. I found the baking soda worked best. My NP said Biotene is basically baking soda. They also gave me a prescription for some rinse, and then I also got the canker sores so they gave me a horrible prescription that contains liquid lidocaine. Check with your MO and they should be able to give you something to help. I found the salt burned, but the baking soda did not. I was miserable for about 5 days. Lost all taste buds as well, and then my mouth felt like I burned it for an additional week. tishabe, we were all so very nervous for the first infusion. It's the unknown that was so hard. I think I can speak for most that all we anticipated and feared was far worse than reality. It certainly isn't fun, nor the aftermath, but once you have the first, you'll know what to expect and can check one off the list. I'm just think that after tomorrow I'm halfway done!

I always freak out because when my sister's bc metastasized, she started having bad back pain and it had gone to her spine.

I have so many friends and family who have gone through chemo and NONE have had ALL the SEs your class mentioned. For me, I've had two infusions, and they both have followed pretty much the same path, but a little less strong this second time. My backs of my legs have just ached for a couple of days, but I take norco and use a heating pad and it seems to help. I awoke with a totally whet tongue again yesterday, it doesn't really hurt, just don't have a lot of taste buds. Today it's already getting better. Yesterday my DH got me a chocolate shake and it was delicious and I could taste it! Seems savory is more dulled with flavor. Will you be getting the neulasta pod or injection post treatment? That is to help rebuild your WBC so you don't get sick. Other than the first 5 days or so post tx, I've met friends for lunch, gone to the movies, gone, shopping, and been around even my little grandkids, all without a mask! I just request that everyone wash hands a lot around me and I'm super careful of washing hands or using sanitizer. My MO said SEs shouldn't get worse as I go along, with the exception of fatigue. I don't have to work or take care of children though so I find I just take a nap and I'm fine. I've heard that exercise helps ward off SEs, but I'll be honest, I haven't been really good about that. I need to do better! I haven't thrown up once, and constipation hasn't been an issue as I start the day of tx and take miralax for the first 4 days or so. I'm off it completely and all is back to normal. It's the Zofran that is so hard with constipation I hear, and I've been lucky not to have to take that past the day of treatment. Absolutely no weight gain, in fact, I usually lose about 5 pounds the week after infusion. I'm still about 3 lbs lower than when I was first diagnosed. I'm careful about what I eat, but have certainly cheated with a few things. Today I feel a lot better, got a great night's sleep last night and bone aches seem to have subsided. It's a long weekend, so hope you all are doing OK. Probably not going to many parties or barbecues, but that's OK. Loaded up on a couple of Netflix and will just relax (gee like what else have I been doing???) Thinking of all and also getting steamed at all the stupid people in this world who say dumb things, and should know better! Cali, I just may take you up on your offer :-) No 5 yr old should say he's \"scared\" to go to school! Hope any of you in Hermine's path are safe and dry. Dara",

The back also has more curl coming in, but it's not long enough to be curls yet, so it looks like a little wave that crimps straight up. The length seems shorter in spots than it was a couple of weeks ago. Very weird! At this rate, it will be 2 years before I can go without a wig etc. Cali, really start applying more of the creams if you're getting red and itchy. Very quickly I went to really reacting to the rads. If you do, just know that the skin heals super quickly. My skin is totally back to normal and has been that way for well over a week. Kechla, while I'm on Anastrozole rather than Tamoxifin, I've know quite a few women on that drug and none of them went off the deep end like that! That's too funny. Sounds more like she went through a mid-life crisis, maybe brought on as was mentioned by the fear of her own mortality. My back is still giving me some problems, but I still made it to the pottery studio yesterday and just had a blast. I can totally forget about everything there and just focus on the clay. Love it. Getting a bit worried that my back pain isn't going away. Guess I need to break down and call/see a doctor. Wondering if it could be the reaction to the Anastrozole (typical SE is joint pain so this may be related.) They're predicting 7 days of rain here so looks like our drought may be easing! We need the rain, but sure miss the sun now. (I'm never satisfied! lol) Have a nice Thursday.",

Took a compazine and then another one this morning. Just a bad head ache last night. Today feel great and am going out to run errands and feel a little more alive! Lori: I'm so sorry about your mom. Had she just fallen and not had the strength to get up? IF she returns home (I know it's doubtful) you might look into one of those alert necklaces that she could just push a button and have you or emergency notified. I've know a couple of people who had them and they really are a life saver! Kelly, so glad you got answers to your questions. Sorry about your scalp. Mine is still pretty sensitive. I find by evening I can't stand to have anything around my head. Still have eyebrows and eyelashes though so that's encouraging. Kechla, can't believe you went through the neulasta pain for nothing. I think there is someone here with neupogen. They use that a lot in Canada as they don't usually give neulasta there. A friend here also had it several yeas ago before neulasta became so prevalent. It is a series of 7 small injections that you give yourself, don't hurt and seem to have the same effect on WBC. Hopefully that will work for you! Looking at the bruises on my hand and arm, I'm wondering if they will keep trying to just use veins. Kathie, I agree... I think the bang idea is a great one. I've seen a number of them in the TLC American Cancer catalogue and think they are great. Last night at 9 pm, I went in to get into comfortable clothes and came out with my wig on (haven't worn it for at least a couple of weeks.) My husband looked at me funny and I just said, I wanted to remember how I looked with hair. I've gotten used to the bald head, but just wanted to feel a little normal. I still have a 5 o\"clock shadow on my head and it drives me crazy because it catches on the pillowcase! LOL Maybe I should get satin cases and sheets. I'm sure that will make me feel sexy!!! (not!:-) ) Hope all else are having an OK day. Anyone having a not-so-great-day, we're all here for you! Dara",

I go out, gout out to eat, shopping, etc. I'm just really cautious about washing washing washing hands, and avoiding anyone with a sniffle of anything. I know it's silly, but I got out of a car and the person parked next to me was coughing and sneezing so I held my breath while I walked away! I know, really dub. My DH had to take a neighbor to ER yesterday and I wasn't really happy with him when he returned. I made him immediately go in and take a shower and put his clothes in the washer. I know there's a lot we can't avoid, I just try to be careful when I can. Kechla, I hope your count comes up quickly. I've heard of others who have to delay an extra week each infusion to get those counts up. I haven't had any liver issues, but have had really elevated calcium and glucose. The steroids cause the glucose increase, and I'm convinced they also are elevating my calcium. I don't take any added vitamins or supplements, so hope everything can get back to normal. Days 3-8 are the hardest for me also. Days 1 and 2 seem pretty normal. I did switch to Allegra last time with the Neulasta, and my SEs for pain etc were less. Don't know if it's because of the Allegra or just that it was the second time for the injection. Kathy and Annie, did you get just bangs or a whole halo? I really like scarves, and just tried using one of those loop scarves and it works so great! But I think the bangs might help a bit. The cap I bought for under the scarves is so wonderful. I got it from Wrapunzel and it's got some poof on the top so it gives you a little vole under the scarf. I have a little bit of a flat head in the back, and this shapes the scarf nicely Plus it has a velvet adjustable headband so nothing slips. I'll check out the site you recommended Kathy. Plus TLC is great for all sorts of products. Annie, so very sorry you got so sick. How many infusions do you have to have? And you don't have to do radiation afterwards do you?",

The general consensus is about 1-2 months after the last chemo lashes and brows go. That seems so unfair! Just when head hair is beginning to grow back, you lose those. You might want to ask you MO about false lashes, or maybe someone else here knows. The woman at my wig store, who had bc a while ago, mentioned that we are not ever allowed to wear false eyelashes, to just stick with liner. There's a great bc sister, Jill, who has made a great video about penciling in eyebrows. I saw a picture and thought she had real eyebrows. She gave me the link to her video: I find I can't wear a wig for very long. I need a good cotton wig cap so it doesn't itch, but I still get the headache also. I've just gotten good at wearing scarves. YouTube has some great videos on how to wrap and tie a scarf. I have a really flat head (ha ha) and found a great \"essential tool\" of a super soft padded undercap, that gives me more volume in the back and looks much better. I got it on Wrapunzel.com. They also have some really pretty scarves for reasonable prices, plus they also have videos for wrapping. Again, it's a learning curve, but I'd rather be researching scarf techniques than bc terminology! Good luck! ",

Have you decided to have a double mastectomy or just the one that is affected? What a precious little girl Josie is. Try to stay focused on the joy she brings into your life and stay as positive as you can. It's so good that the pet scan showed no metastasis. You've got this as well.

That's when they want to treat with something else. My infusion was uneventful yesterday They gave me two bags of steroids and an infusion of benedryl, on top of my oral steroids and Claritin. Let's just say I was awake every hour last night and never fell asleep during the infusion yesterday even though I could barely keep my eyes open. BUT only one more left. Steroids really play havoc with me, not just with sleep, but also blood work. My glucose shot up to 422 last night which freaked me out a little. I took a pill and even though exhausted, got on my recumbent bike and pedaled it down to 388. Next two days should be OK until Neulasta kicks in. Cali, hope your day goes smoothly today.

Just check with your RO about what you are using. Some ROs have specific do's and don'ts. I saw my MO for 2 month check. I've been having so many joint pains he decided to change my AI from Anastrozole (Aremidex) to Aromasin (Exemestane). I was fine with the change until I showed up at the pharmacy and my co-pay for the generic is $379! And that's for a 1 month supply! My other one was $7. I got it and will try it for one month, but since I go back to MO in 1 month, I think I\"ll ask for a change again. Can't figure out this one is so expensive.

My rads were first thing in the morning which I think helped because then I'd try to distract myself for the rest of the day in any way I could. Hang in. All of a sudden it will seem they're over.

Kelly, I've been sucking on ice the last two infusions, and have still gotten mouth sores and thrush. I don't think the icing is working for me either. What I think helps the most is to start rinsing and gargling with baking soda the day I start chemo and go for about seen days after or until the mouth sores are gone. Tunegrl, sorry you haven't had the result you hoped for. My tumor was 1.7cm but I did surgery first. Other than a tiny line for a scar, I can barely tell any difference at all post surgery and it was right smack in front on the upper side of the nipple area. So even if your tumor doesn't shrink more, you may find it's not too bad post surgery. I'll hope for more size reduction though. Kechla, isn't it just the best to see the finish line getting so close? (at least for this phase?) I know I still have to do 30 rad tx, but other than that being every day for 6 weeks, most say it is so much easier with SEs. How is your cold capping working? I'm wondering if those that went that route are satisfied with the results? Has anyone lost eyelashes and eyebrows yet? Mine have thinned but I still have a few. I've heard they can still come out up to 2 months after tx stops. I'm heading into my good week so am excited. This tx really took 2 weeks to come back from, so I plan to do all sorts of fun things this next week. I have a family lunch tomorrow as long as everyone is healthy. I haven't seen my kids or grandkids for 3 weeks as they all got colds, and one had pink eye after the start of school. Really miss them all! Hope all are feeling well by now and have a nice Saturday.

He loved it and got to go shopping. Also, just last Friday he was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. For the last 3 years we've noticed him putting on a little weight so his parents got him checked and his thyroid is basically not working. His mom was dx at age 15 and it runs in his family. He's being tested for a number of other things also but at least they found it super young and can address it early. Some have asked about my other DGS with all the issues. It's getting quite ugly! My DD has had to retain a lawyer, involve (and pay for) private evaluators, set up an independent assessment team, and do royal battle with two different school districts. The problem is, there are few public or private school geared at meeting his needs, without about a 2 hr bus ride! Hard to believe that in the San Diego area there aren't more options! She can't homeschool as she teaches high school and her DH is a captain with the fire dept. Plus, he really needs the socialization. Marlene, You can update your profile in Settings on your info page. I need to do some research on the two types of radiation before I meet with my MO next week. Did your RO make the proton recommendation? I've now started taking weekly pics of my head so I can monitor growth. I still have just a few eyebrow hairs and about 1/2 my lashes. I have a few fine arm hairs left, but the rest (and I do mean ALL the rest lol!) is naked baby skin. Pretty weird! Makes for quick showers though :-) SEs are now minimal.

MFabella, so glad you're sticking with us. I think it's just important to have a group that can support no matter what the start date. Fireheart, you look awesome! I've been trying to figure out what to to do and when to do it. My hair is coming out pretty good now. I thought it wouldn't start until next week (day 14 is Monday), but yesterday I started noticing it and if I even run my fingers through my hair, the fingers are a total mess with hair. I'm hoping to get through Monday and then will probably go in and have it cut off. Karey, hang in; your'e not the only one. I find I read through the posts and then have to go back and remember who said what. Maybe I'll just blame it all on \"chemo brain.\" Ajb, welcome, and you may find that the SEs aren't as bad as we imagine. I met two former colleagues for lunch today and they kept going on about how good I look. I think we all have a stereotype about how really bad people look on chemo. They've made such strides in contacting SEs and in many cases, the fatigue is the worst part of it all. I did get the SE of mouth sores and issues, so recommend everyone, even those without the port, suck on ice chips during infusion. The mouth issues are pretty miserable, and the \"magic mouthwash\" is the worst tasting stuff I've ever tasted. I'm sure it will be worth it though if I react again. Hi to everyone else, we are getting large in number, but I love that there are just that many more to offer support and compare our experiences. I went to the movies today and saw Pete's Dragon with two of my young grandsons. Such a cute movie if you have little ones or grandkids.",

And with all that's going on this month, I kinda nada melt down. I just posted this this morning on FB, I shared on LL also. An October Vent, The month of October has been designated as Breast Cancer Awareness month. Yet do we really want to be aware of breast cancer or those who have or are experiencing it? We wrap cancer up in a pretty pink ribbon; everywhere we look we see pink, pink, pink. We see people sporting beautiful pink scarves around their neck or cute little t-shirts, and sponsor or participate with events that raise awareness and money for breast cancer, but it looks much different when you're looking at it close up, with all it's ugliness and grotesque features, the scars, the IVs, the pain, the fear, the isolation. We all live such busy lives, engaged with family, friends, work, hobbies, daily chores and events. But no one realizes how that can come to a screeching halt when cancer rears its ugly head. It doesn't just slowly permeate your body, it rips into you and temporarily strips you of everything that makes you who you are. Your body betrays you, every hair on your body abandons you, and life as you know it changes forever. Somehow, a pink ribbon just can't cover it up. Thank God breast cancer is one cancer with a good early detection and remission rate, but make no mistake, people that we dearly love still die from it. And those who go through treatment will forever cringe at the slightest lump, pain, or yearly test or checkup. The fundraising, the awareness, the research is so needed and so valued by all. Cancer treatment has made huge strides in the past years, but it is still devastating. People often say, they just don't know what to say when someone has cancer, or they don't want to disturb someone going through treatment. But the isolation that envelops you when that diagnosis comes in is sometimes harder than the treatment itself. So, fine, tie that pink ribbon, but take that ribbon off sometimes, and connect with someone who sees the real ugly truth about breast cancer. Send a text, make a call, smile at someone wearing a scarf or beanie on his/her head. You're not disturbing us, you're making us feel we are still here and we are important. We may look different, but we're still the same person inside. And I for one, am wearing every color except pink in October!",

Lori, this time around I'm going to use the neulasta pod. Last time I had to drive all the way to the hospital for the injection and really thought the pod sounded so much better! Although it's weird to think that it takes an hour to push the meds in through the pod. I just got a regular old injection and that was it. They did make me sit there for a few minutes to be sure I didn't react, so maybe that's the safeguard with the pod. Well, my hair is really doming out in handfuls! I thought it would take till next week, but day 10 I started to notice a few wisps and by today when I run my fingers through the back, it's coming out in clumps. I was combing my hair this morning and pulling it out from the comb. My DH looked at me and said \"Do you want me to got the glue gun?\" :-) I deal with things with humor better than sympathy and he knows me well! I'm trying to hold out till Tuesday and then will go to my hairdresser and have it buzzed. Lori, I'd love your list if you'll share. Jiffrig, hope the no SEs keeps up. My MO said our reactions shouldn't be any worse after the first dose. KZ1966, welcome, and glad you decided to jump in with us! (Although sorry you need to be here.) This is a really great support group. It's so helpful to talk about your experiences with people who really know what you're going through. Hope, it's funny you mentioned watermelon. Yesterday, a neighbor brought over a huge container of cut up seedless watermelon. I've never tasted anything so good. My mouth is still \"tender\" feeling like I burned it on hot food. That watermelon was ice cold and sweet and juicy! Best thing ever! I did find my taste buds improved after about 5 days, just still feeling sensitive. Hi to everyone else! Hope your weekend is going gray. Dara",

I'm very careful about the BP and blood draws also, even wear a medical alert bracelet just to be safe. I'll have to ask about the sugar checks. SweetRain, what a wonderful story. And I'm going to have to take my wigs in to have them trimmed. I had it done originally when I bought the wig, but still am not happy with the results. So I just keep buying new wigs! I haven't spent thousands on them, but the first 2 were $400+ . I just bought two less expensive ones online so maybe I'll just try my hairdresser. I find that now that I've finished chemo, I want to have hair again or at least feel a little more normal. Since it will be at least a year before my hair rows in enough, I know I need to feel comfortable in a wig. Hope others getting tx this week are doing OK. this second week post-chemo has been up and down. Good one day and then yuck the next. Yesterday I was nauseous all day long. Finally kept a little chicken noodle soup down last night. Eyes still twitching like crazy so sure hope that goes away. Cali, how's your throat doing? I so hope it's getting better. Can you at least get down a malt or shake? I found with my mouth issues I did better with cold, even if I couldn't taste it. I had a couple of people make homemade soup for me, and I found it was so delicious when eaten ice cold! Elizabeth, hope your SEs were minimal after your tx and you don't end up in ER again! My infusions were always about 4 1/2 hours, then tack on my blood draw and dr visit, and I spent the whole day there! Such fun. Take care Hi to everyone else, hope you're having a good day.",

You all are my heroes who have young families. I know you all want to keep things going as usual, but hope you also give yourself permission to ask for help or at the very least, feel OK putting a Disney movie in!!! Once you get your first infusion, I think it will help so you know how you'll react. For me, it's always the unknown which is the hardest.

I'm so sorry that they just seem to get harder as you go along. Just know that a few weeks out from the last one, things do return to a much better state. My fatigue from the chemo has lessened tremendously, and the fatigue from rads hasn't hit in yet. Yesterday I actually worked out on my patio and painted a little tea cart, bought some plants to repot, and had a really nice day. My only reaction to tx so far has been some nausea, but more queasy stomach and gagging. Problem is ro says its not from RO, MO says it's not from Arimidex. Everyone on the rads board says yes, it's from the rads but ROs don't like to admit that! Hope you all start feeling a little better. Rest, rest, rest. This too will pass! Love you guys. Dara",

I had to go in for rads yesterday morning so that then we can all have 4 days off for T-day. My DH and I were going to go out for breakfast afterward, but when I got home, he had some sort of bug and wound up in bed all day. It's been raining here all night so I hate the thought of going out so early this morning for rads. I have to leave the house around 7:20, but at least then I have the whole day left. I'm still doing great with the rads. skin is just fine and I only get a little tired towards evening or if I'm pretty active . See my RO again today but all really is great (knock on wood!)

I buy organic oats, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, shaved coconut, sliced almonds, dried blueberries or cranberries, and cinnamon, mixed with a little brown sugar, maple syrup, and coconut oil. I'm addicted now, but googled and found out most of the ingredients are really high in calcium, so I'm thinking I need to try to not have any and see if it has an effect. I don't drink milk, eat ice-cream etc. This all started with the start of chemo, but the drugs shouldn't cause that SE. Fun times!",

Sorry I didn't post yesterday, was following along on my phone, but I can't post through that and was just wiped out when I got home. Like Scary, I woke up at 2AM the night before and never got back to sleep, don't know if it was my premeds of steroids or just nerves. I had my labs, saw my oncologist with a few more questions, and then headed off the infusion lab. I was surprised that for longer infusions (BC) they have all little private rooms with TV, internet, etc. My nurse was beyond nice as was everyone. I was worried since I'm doing straight IV without port or pick line, but it was no problem. I'd been drowning myself with water and the nurse was so good at the IV. Took about 3 hours and I was fine the home time. Then had an hour drive home-- my stomach just ached a little but no nausea or anything. Had some homemade chicken noodle soup and just crashed when I got home. I think I slept for about 11 hours! Feel ok this morning, Just had a cup of coffee and taste buds seem fine so far. The chemo nurse said my cocktail takes a couple of days to have SEs set in so I'll see how things go. Karey, did your MO give you any specifics about the possibility of permanent hair loss with taxotere? Don't want to scare anyone, but someone on another post mentioned it in response to my regimen, and some lawsuits going on so I'm a little freaked out now. I googled it this morning, but don't want to get all \"wigged out\" since I guess it's a bit late now. Also, I had my chemo \"trunk\" all packed :-) brought my laptop to watch a movie, had snacks candies, and of course pickle juice! (The chemo nurse cracked up at that and said she'd never heard of that, but did talk about the claritin after the neulasta injection.) Anyway, didn't use any of it, just read on my kindle as did my DH. The nurses kept coming around offering snacks, sandwiches, drinks, etc. I think next time I'll travel light. Lori, also learned that the metallic taste is with those with port, maybe because of the proximity of the mouth. My nurse said I shouldn't have that reaction since I'm going straight into the vein in my hand. When she flushed the IV, I had no problems. Hope all else are doing well. I know the anticipation before hand is about as bad as the waiting for test results. I know SEs will probably still set in, but at least with one behind me I am dealing with it better. Thanks for all the good wishes and thoughts. Mine are with all of you starting this week. Will keep you posted. Dara",

Came home and stretched out on my bed topless with a cold washcloth on it and that felt the best!. Rads really isn't so bad and don't want to scare anyone. I only had problems the last couple of weeks, and some people have not problems at all. Only 3 more to go!!!!!! I can do this, and you all can also. I finish #36 on Thursday and plan to celebrate. SweetRain, like Kelly, I got the terrible mouth sores and thrush right from my first treatment. I got two prescription mouth washes, one for thrush (thick white coating on tongue) and also the canker sores. They both were horrible tasting, but did work some. I also found hourly rinses with salt and warm water helped almost the most. Brandi, I love the pictures. I've gone back and looked at the last three pics and can finally tell things are growing! It doesn't look it in the pics, but my hair is coming in much darker that it was pre-bc. Hope you all have a good week. 10-17-16 12-9-16 12-26-16 It sure grows at a snails pace though!",

Hope, You look so beautiful with the buzzed head! I know this sounds stupid, but you really do have a beautifully shaped head! But I agree, your wig looks just like your other hair. Kelly, you're so lucky to have a husband to cook. Mine is awesome and he USED to cook, especially when I went back to work, but it seems that unless it's barbecuing, he's lost now in the kitchen! So yesterday I felt awesome when I got up, I had some watermelon, coffee and then switched to ice water. I went in, got cleaned up, put on makeup and a pretty scarf. Then all hell broke lose, literally! I hadn't taken anything for constipation since Tuesday night and things seems back to normal. All of a sudden I started with diaharrea and broke out in a cold sweat and everything started getting black. I got out of the bathroom and called my husband for help. Luckily (or unluckily for my DS) my sone was at the house and came in. I had sat on stool by my sink and started passing out. My DS held me up and I kept passing in and out of consciousness while my DH called 911. The totally upsetting (I know I'm ridiculous) part was that I had no control whatsoever over the D and just sat as it kept coming. Paramedics and firemen came, and while they were so nice, I was totally embarrassed! My son kept holding me up until they got there as he knew I'd fall. Was in and out about 3-4 times, and then come around enough to change clothes and get put on a gurney. Then spent the next 7 hrs in the emergency. My WBC wasn't bad, around 4.0 but blood work showed some reaction to undisclosed infection, but ultimately contacted my MO and it seems it's all related to the chemo drugs. They poked my poor arm and hand 6 times and I'm a mess with lumps and bruising now. Glad I have a couple of weeks to recover before another round of chemo. MY DIL and DS have definitely earned a BIG place in heaven after yesterday. As a mom, we never want our kids, especially our sons, to have to see us like that! My DD came up to the hospital, and I had to laugh. She is a total germophobe and she hated even breathing in the ER! LOL. There was a very sad homeless man in the bed across from me, someone two beds down had to have his stomach pumped, there were moans and groans coming from all directions. The ER dr said we weren't to let anyone come near me without washing hands right outside my cubicle. I had a mask on the whole time, but when the nurse came for another blood draw, my DH wouldn't let her even open the curtain until he watched her wash hands, THEN put on gloves. The doc said their goal was to get me out as quickly as possible! Oh, the indignities of cancer! Don't want to scare anyone, but just hope hearing our experiences help someone ward off a couple of these fun times! I feel good today, an am hungry! So much for fun Labor Day weekend! At least I ensured the medical field had a little labor to celebrate! Hope all are doing OK. Missed you all yesterday! Dara ",

Are you now on blood thinners? You may have mentioned it but can't remember (chemo brain, right? lol) My husband has been on Coumadin for years. With pottery, I throw on a wheel. I find it's so therapeutic and I forget about everything else when I pot. Yesterday I got to puppy sit for my son and family's new puppy, a 6 week of female basset hound. She is so young that most of the day she just wanted to be on my lap asleep. So darling! (but glad I got to come home and get a good night's sleep!)  One other little positive note regarding my little grandson, Camden... He's now in his 3rd week at the new school and just loves it. His teacher called my daughter yesterday to request a parent conference next week. They have a BIG IEP (eval) in two weeks, but the teacher wants to meet early because she said they are all so impressed with how smart he is, how fast he is learning and meeting goals, and retaining what he has learned. (This same child who at the old school, was just allowed to wander the classroom because they said he really couldn't learn... in kindergarten!) The teacher wants to discuss his goals because he will will be attaining his goals for the year very quickly. What a difference! Well, I think on Tuesday I must have pulled a muscle in my lower back, at least I hope I just pulled a muscle. I woke up during the night with it aching and have been pampering it since then. I hope it's nothing else or a late reaction to my estrogen blocker. I'll see my RO next week, and my MO the beginning of Feb. Isn't it hard when you feel any ache or pain not to just to conclusions that it's related to cancer? Cali, sure hope all the tests come back clear. Lyn, Elizabeth, and all, hope you have a good weekend! Everyone stay healthy and let's enjoy the moment!",

They said it's not unusual for it to take a year and that some of their patients hit the wall around noon! I guess I should count my blessings. So I'll vent just a tiny bit. .. Since recovering from bc I REALLY HATE to cook. I think by night time I'm just too tired to plan and cook dinner, but I really don't feel like cooking at any other time of day. Anyone else feel like that? I'm trying to tackle projects like cleaning out closets, but find I have to sit periodically. My back, hips, and knees get really sore. I'm not sure if it's the new AI (now on generic femara) or if it's psoriatic arthritis. My dermatologist is fighting the insurance company to pay for a drug I used to take, Otezla, that was like a miracle drug for the psoriasis and arthritis. The drug costs over $2700 per month, and I can't afford that! He's making the claim that now that I've had bc, it's the only drug I'm allowed to take, the others suppress the immune system. Keep your fingers crossed! Kelly, hope you can get in to the infectious disease specialist soon. It may be nothing but it's nice to get that confirmation from the doctor. I'm just having so much fun with my pottery! I can go to the studio 6 days a week and find I can just forget about everything there!

Have you asked the MO if there is any chance of just going IV for one or two treatments while your port heals? I'm only doing IV as I only have to have 4 chemos and no herception. While I know the drugs are hard, I haven't had any problems at all. My MO said if possible, he prefers patients to use IV because of infections, limitations, and just having one more thing put into our bodies. I know you wouldn't want to do it with all your treatments, but it might buy you a little time. I have absolutely no limitations post chemo infusion. My veins are doing great so far, sometimes a little bruising, as I first have blood draw and then infusion. My MO said if my veins start to show any problems, then he could always order the port or picc. Then when I went to ER 2 weeks ago I wound up with 2 IVs and 4 other pokes for blood draws, all on the same side. It may not be in your best interest, but thought I'd raise the question. So sorry about the water issues. I know how you feel, When we moved into this house two years ago, we completely gutted and renovated the entire house, right down to the studs, and including wood floors. 1 month after we moved in there was a 100 year storm and it flooded half of our house. Floors, drywall, etc. all had to be ripped out and replaced! Then less than a year later, a sprinkler in the back broke and the exact same rooms flooded again! Same scenario. We've since put in new drains, grates, etc. to divert water out into a canyon behind us! I felt like I needed to start building an ark! Kelly, we lived for a number of years in Colorado. Beautiful state, and the weather, while having definite seasons, wasn't too too bad in winter. We lived way up in the mountains and loved it. Did move back here though when my daughter was born to be close to family. Now my kids and grandkids are in So Cal so looks like we will stay here. Cali and Lyn, second opinions are always a good idea. My numbers weren't great, but ultimately came out ++-. But my progesterone was barely 20%+ and my HER2 was in conclusion Ki67 borderline, but then FSH was negative. So I had the lx now chemo, and then will do 30 or so rads when I finish this. Then 5-10 years AI. Long journey! I'll see my BS on Tuesday for my 3 mo post surgery check. I love her so will enjoy the visit. Terri, hope that infection gets better quickly. I'm now starting on my 3rd pcp since diagnosis and I couldn't get an appt. with him until Oct 25!! ( I called for appt on Sept. 9! Good thing I'm not sick!",

I believe there was a July group, but sometimes it's hard to find them. I think the most important thing is to have a place where we can go for questions, support, and sharing. The start dates really aren't as important. Day 2 post #3 for me and doing fine. Yesterday also had to go back to center to see my BS for my 3 month incision check. It took all of about 5 minutes, she looked at it, said it looked awesome, the thin breast scar will fade during rads (she said), and she'll see me in 9 months for a 3D mammogram and US. That seems like such a long way away. I was thinking I had a momma after 6 months, but she said she wants to wait 6 months after rads as the breast tissue needs to settle down after rads or we could be chasing down little changes just caused by radiation. Looks like I\"ll wait 3 weeks post #4 and then start 30 rad tx. I'm loading up on yogurt right now trying to avoid intestinal issues I had last time. Elizabeth, how are you feeling? Still in hospital? Sure hope you're doing better and can get home quickly! JandJ, I do take melatonin, and often take a 5mg ambient for sleep. Years ago I used to take benedryl to try to help me sleep, but now I find I don't respond that way. Even with the chemo, the nurses always say, you'll get sleepy or take a nap now, and I never sleep. I don't do too badly when I\"m not taking the premed steroid or right after all the steroids during tx. Luckily, I am able to take a quick nap if needed so I just go with the flow right now. Kelly, so long as this thread is still active, we can keep this group together. I see some where people stay together and post years after. I know we all hope to move on to a more normal life, but I feel like so many of you are friends, and hope to stay in touch even when all the chaos begins to fade! I know I want to see lots more pictures of Annie and her little girl as she grows up! :-) Cali, hope all went well yesterday. Going to go get some breakfast.

I finally fell asleep around 1:30 AM last night. My problem is that I don't sleep at night so am tired during the day and take a nap. I think today I need to just stay awake. Anyone ever hear from WenchLori? Wonder how she's been doing. She should be about done I think. SusanaQ, welcome, you, Cali, and I are right in sequence.

Cali, I too wonder how things went with your mammo? Thinking of you. Mine is on the 27th. Had such an incredibly busy week last week and then weekend. I participated in a big pottery open house at the studio, then an all day birthday party (which I helped with by making all the centerpieces) for 167 people. This friend is a paraplegic (from polio as a child) and then had breast cancer 17 years ago. She turned 80 and people came from all over the country! She's pretty amazing and inspirational. I was thinking of your article, Kelly at the party. I saw a couple of people who didn't even know that I'd gone through cancer. It's hard for me when I get the response, \"Oh but the cancer is gone now right?\" I know they're trying to be positive, but I always flash on that tiny fear, well, it can always pop up again. I just always answer, \"I sure hope so!\" I'm probably at about 85-90% of the time I forget about the cancer. As the weather starts heating up here, I think I'll be going witless more and more so that may help. My hair has gotten much thicker, just not growing longer very fast. And Kelly, I still have about 5 different cowlicks! My husband and I crack up! Hello to anyone else still checking in here. Have a wonderful week. And congratulations to your daughter Kelly! I've been hearing a lot about adolescent and childhood migraines.Hope she and you find relief pretty quickly.",

It is also an awesome thread and the women are terrific. I've popped into a few others, but this one and lumpectomy lounge really are my favorites. I was thinking I should look into a rad thread, (I'll be starting in about 4-5 weeks) but quite honestly, lumpectomy lounge and this thread I feel, can address just about anything and I feel like I know you all pretty well. I had my lumpectomy in June and it really was not bad at all. Just stock up on frozen peas lol! They were my friend the first couple of days. Ask any questions, here or on the other site. People are really supportive. At least we can see the end of the chemo tunnel! (Or I should say, I sort of see it as I'm losing my lashes so my eyes water constantly and still twitch nonstop!)

I'm allergic to the adhesive also and know how really sore that skin can be. It was a rough week last week. My brother is in Florida and we were worried about him with the hurricane, but then we lost my sister-in-law last Thursday to brain cancer. She had a melanoma that metastasized to the brain and it progressed very rapidly. Such an insidious disease cancer is! Kechla, I went in for an MRI yesterday and will see my orthopedist in October so I guess I'll see if the AI is having any effect on my joints. Also, my grandson is doing super well. He is now at a new school, back to his neighborhood school in Carlsbad. He's been mainstreamed for 60% of the time in a regular 1st grade and is thriving. The teacher and class are so receptive to him, he has a new little best friend named Annabelle who has bright pink hair! The teachers met my daughter after school the first friday and said \"thank you for giving us the gift of Camden in our class this year!\" My daughter started to cry. The kids are so interested in Camden and sign language that his signing aide has been given permission to teach the whole class sign language twice a week. His teacher said they are just amazed at how intelligent his is and now they just need to find the best ways to tap into that. What a difference from a year ago when the first school said he was unteachable and couldn't be educated!!! I'm still doing lots of pottery and still totally enjoying it. Here are a couple of shots of my pots looking down on the center. I'm experimenting with new glazes. ",

I know my calcium levels have been elevated since I started chemo and I'm sure it's the steroids. My sodium levels are also low (but not dramatically). Just staying glued to the TV with the hurricane. My brother is 6 miles north of Daytona and did not evacuate. Hope everyone along the path stays safe.

Her doctor told her that if it hit 500 she needed to go to the ER. She found that if she got on her recumbent bike and pedaled for an hour or so, it helped her body process the sugars faster. But you and I know just how much you feel like bike riding after a full day of chemo! I'm doing OK. I had broken my arm (radius and one small bone in the wrist) but got my cast off on Wednesday. Then had a big pottery show/sale on Sunday and darned if I didn't fall again on some uneven brick steps. I'm fine and didn't break anything again, but boy I feel like I'm 101 yrs old! I have to accept that my balance is terrible due to a foot surgery that has fallen apart. Also having some hip issues and just wondering when all this \"fun\" will come to an end. I hope all have a good week. I just love that the weather has finally cooled here. I've included a couple of pictures of the pottery \"pre-fall\". I had 8 pieces included and other members contributed also. It was such a beautiful location in Claremont with spectacular views. ",

And I hope your DH is able to get some relief. Cali, I was just telling my son about a dream I had the night before... I went back to where I worked and no one recognized me, even people I was very close to. And finally the secretary (who was a friend) came in and told me I had to leave because I was a liability. I've had neighbors up the street not recognize me as well. And the wigs just bug me to death, and I actually feel more self-conscious in them over the scarves. Also, don't forget to take your meds!

My RBC is also low and has been going down each treatment. MO told me also that is what causes the fatigue. My WBC is high though so I know the Neulasta is also working. My calcium and glucose levels are high (we think due to steroids). My MO also wants me to start right away on vitamin D3. He said studies have shown a common deficiency with bc patients. I\"m not out in the sun too much as it's so very hot here in the summer, so now that it's cooling down (and I hopefully feel a little better) I can get out more. I'll start a supplement to begin with. He said not to start biotin for hair growth until after the next three weeks due to chemo.

I have psoriatic arthritis quite badly, have had 3 hip replacements, a knee replacement, foot reconstruction (which has totally fallen apart again) and a severed gluteus medium in one hip.

I'll see my surgeon again in July, but again no stress! Hope all are having a nice Sunday. I'm off to throw some pots on my patio! My happy place :-)",

Hope you feel better so you can start rads. I'll know my schedule tomorrow when I can start. Kechla, I did go to the site and read up on the supplement. For years, I took Echinachia (sp?) and found I never got a cold or anything. Studies showed that it didn't do anything, but I figured what did it matter if it worked for me? Do you get yours from your company, or is it available in health food stores? I took your advice and started taking double doses of Claritin for my eyes and they seem to be getting better. I'm still a bit nauseous each day, but hopefully that will be better each day also. Cali, so glad you got your wigs trimmed. I find that now I don't really want to wear scarves as much, and I know it will be a very long time before I can wear my own hair. I find myself rubbing the top of my head ofter :-) and find the stubbles are back where it was smooth, and in the mirror I notice a couple of wayward longer stray hairs! Pretty weird. I just hope I'm not one of the 10% who take taxotere where hair loss is permanent. Kelly, next week is #5, right? Soon you'll be starting the final countdown. Hang in there! Elizabeth, how are things going? Pain any better? My MO did give me a prescription of Norco for bone pain that helped quite a bit when things were bad. It's allowed during chemo also. Thinking of you. I'm off to a new GP today. I don't think anyone here knows my story of my last one. I switched after 25 years when my old GP retired and I didn't care for the new replacement. The new GP was a young female (I thought that would be great) but she was horrid!!!! She was disgusted that I had a lumpectomy instead of mastectomy, said I was crazy to subject my body to radiation, wanted to know WHY I had had so many surgeries in the last few years (numerous joint replacements due to psoriatic arthritis, I couldn't even walk) and was generally just nasty. I couldn't wait to get out of her office! Hope everyone else is doing OK and hanging in.",

All my labs looked great. He wasn't really concerned about the cyst I found, but he's really young, and I never get warm fuzzies from him. I'll see my surgeon next week for my yearly check and she's the hugger really sweet. I usually get my mammogram and US then see heron the afternoon for results. Since I already got my results, there's no anxiety for this visit. I've been down for the last 6 days with a nasty stomach virus. I even had such pain in my bones, I thought I was back on chemo with the neulasta packs. I don't feel bad now, but still can't keep much down. A friend and I are planning a trip mid month to Silver City, New Mexico for their Clay Festival. They have all sorts of workshops, art shows, and lectures on pottery so I think it will be really fun. My hair is now past my shoulders in the back. It once again has really thinned after coming in really thick to begin with. My biggest problem is that my sides are just below and ears and grow at a snails pace. I did start using a new shampoo and conditional called Cerafil by Redkin. It's for intense treatment of thinning hair. I don't think it really makes a big difference, but I love the scent and my hair seems easier to fix. They make a lotion you spray on before drying and it says it's like getting 6,000 hairs instantly! How did they come up with that number??? Too funny! I really do like the products though. Kelly I'd love to plan a CA get together sometime. I'm pretty open since I'm retired (yay!!) Kechla, I relate to the low carb diet. My sugars have been high since chemo. After 4 days with no eating and little drinking with the flu, my fasting sugars were still 163! It just seems like we should get a pass on everything else for the rest of our lives! What's my dream list? A little shed on my back patio for a studio with a small ac in a window. The big studio I go to has no AC and it really gets bad. I seem to be super sensitive to the heat this year. Maybe the hormone blockers?? Hang in all. Love to all and it's so good to know we're here for each other. Dara",

I know it's hard to face yet another week of \"yuck\" but just keep telling yourself, one more down. You're almost there! Hope all had a great weekend. It was pretty warm here. I actually made it to two of my grandsons' soccer game, the last one of the season. Last year we went all the time, but this year, It just didn't work out. Then afterwards, DH and I went out and I got a new car. Such fun but exhausting. I got a 2016 Toyota Highlander with all the bells and whistles. Spent yesterday morning reading all the books and trying to get my phone and garage door programmed. I just love it. My other car was a 10 year old Lexus that I still just loved, but it had 165,000 miles on it and we knew it would start costing a bunch of money. What are you all doing for Thanksgiving? My kids are doing all the cooking but then bringing it here for the afternoon. My DH wasn't too happy as he feels it too exhausting for me to have it here, even if I don't do the cooking. My son only lives 5 minutes from me, and I thought all the grandkids would have more fun there with the trampoline and toys, but my son and family are going away for a few days right before T-day and they worry about getting the house ready. My DD and 3 grandkids are in Carlsbad, and I don't want to do the drive that day.... So my house :-) Oh, just an update, my DD has decided to move her middle son back to Carlsbad for school. The signing school has done a complete turnaround with attitude once an attorney got involved, but his academic needs are still not being met at all by the teacher. My DD visited the new kindergarten class he will go into and was astounded at the difference. The only problem is that he will have a signing aide, but none of the children nor teacher sign. I still think it's for the best however. He'll start the new school Dec 5 so we'll see-- keep your fingers crossed. Off to rads. It's good and bad having such an early morning appt. Love you guys and hope the next tx isn't too hard. <3",

I started back using Pureology daily shampoo and it has a mint scent that kind of tingles as well. I'm 5 weeks out today, but still not much more than the stubble, with a few crazy gray hairs that stick straight out! My MO and several others told me not to expect much growth for 8 weeks. JandJ, a lot of my family loves to camp in the desert for Thanksgiving also. Ours will be fairly low key this year also. Saw the RO today and all i fine. I think I'm having more reaction to the AI (Arimidex) than the rads. I have short bouts of nausea and then not much appetite. No problem with taste buds, just nothing sounds good. Oh well, could be worse. RO says that should subside once my body adjust to the change in hormone level. Absolutely no joint pain though which is what I was most worried about... knock on wood!",

I went back and read the posts from September to catch up. Lynn, I heard the giggle in the \"You're not the boss of me!\" even without an emoji! I hear it all the time with my grandkids. :-) I think I had mentioned that I've been battling a stretch of E coli since June. Thought I had the flu, then UTI. After 5 rounds of antibiotics, my (dumb) primary dr finally sent me to a specialist who determined that I have a super bug strain of E coli called ESBL. It means the bacteria emits an enzyme that kills off the antibiotic and allows the bacterial to spread to my blood. There are no oral meds that can kill it. Soooo, I'm now undergoing 10 days of infusion therapy (very reminiscent of our chemo days!!!) and hope that will get rid of this. Once again... Haven't we all done our part enough regarding medical conditions! I'm really ready to be normal! I'm still trying to keep my pottery going. I've slowed a bit, but am able to now sit and do my carving on my pots at home. Still adore it and it gives me a way to forget about everything else! Also, we adopted a darling 3 yr old basset from my son. She didn't get along with their other dog and needed to rehome her. We just love her and she's so much company. I'll include a couple of pics of the happy aspects of my life! You all hang in. I love catching up with you all and hope your days include something great just for you! PS have we had Annie check in lately? I think of her often and send good vibes her way. Take care all. Keep thinking about that get to gather somewhere, maybe when the weather cools. Love, Dara  ",

A couple of people who have seen me without the wig have looked at it and said \"why do you have that on?\" I know they are trying to be supportive, but again, I believe it's about my choice. I'm seeing a new dr today, a rheumatologist. I don't know if the letrozole is adding to my joint pain or what. Then off to the studio for more pottery.

Yesterday I actually used a 3/4\" curling iron to give my hair some body. Someone at the studio actually asked if it was my own hair and commented how thick it is. (She's been on vacation for 2 1/2 weeks. Frequently we think our hair isn't improving, growing getting thicker when we're looking at it day after day. I still recommend taking regular pictures (just for your own sake) and then go back and see the changes. I'm now 8 1/2 months PFC. Still not at all happy with the speed of growth, but the hair has definitely grown. I'm only about 3-4 weeks going 100% without my wig. Do whatever it is that makes you feel good about yourself and makes you feel comfortable. It's hard enough dealing with all the other crap with bc, and I resented people who said \"Why are you still wearing that wig?\" Our appearance is very personal, and I support doing whatever makes YOU feel good. I tried Rogaine, but also quit after a few weeks. Have used Nioxin since I finished chemo and still use it. Also use the Nioxin Night Density and take Biotin. We're all different, and our hair grows at equally different rates. Hang in everyone. We're all here to support each other!

My whole life I've had good hair that I always style, curled, etc. I never went out of the house unless my hair was \"perfect.\" Now, I won't even go out to the driveway to move my car in the garage without my wig on. My hair has filled in nicely, but is still so damn short. I don't think it's grown any in about two weeks and seems almost shorter in a couple of places. I worry that if I sleep on the same side I\"m breaking some off on that side, but I can't sleep on the other side as my lymph node and lumpectomy area still get tender. I know I have a good wig, most people think it's my own hair and are stunned if I say it's a wig, but more and more I just need to rip it off. I will now take it off in the car if I'm driving home in the evening. It really isn't that any of us are vain, but our appearance is always part of our identity, and the very last visual remnant of our cancer. People and doctors say, \"Now go live your life\" but until one has experienced this, you don't realize that we can't easily do that. Of course we wouldn't choose hair over health, but I really wonder if in the future, medicine will look back on the poisons we have to put into our bodies as the Dark Ages. It's like we can get through the surgeries, chemo and rads, and that should be enough. Then we take the hormone therapy and the SEs continue. Every joint in my body hurt, and my dermatologist put me back on the one drug I can now take for psoriatic arthritis. My insurance finally approved it, but my co-pay is $1079 PER MONTH! But it's working! It just seems like things keep hitting us all. Hang in there sisters! We're strong women and we will get through all this. Feel free to vent to all of us anytime. (BTW, is anyone else having problems logging in to the community? Moderators have been trying to fix my problems for months. I keep getting the message that my login or password are wrong and I must reset. Annoying.)",

Seq, I think my hair has really slowed again. I've now tried all 3 AIs and have settled in on Letrozole (Femara). The other morning I was feeling a bit discouraged and asked my husband if he thought my hair was still growing. He said \"Oh yes, the other night I looked over and thought, wow, her mohawk is getting longer!\" LOL, I first wanted to kill him, but after 45 years of marriage, I know him well. My hair tends to stick straight up on the top of my head. I know I look OK in the wig and feel fine going out in it, but as the weather warms, etc., I just wish I didn't have to wear it. I think back to last Easter which was the last holiday before my big \"discovery\" and can't quite believe all that has gone on in the past year. I agree that we've had/done enough. I hate that the AI really slows my metabolism and I have to watch weight and what I eat so carefully. The only thing that is keeping me sane is my pottery. I go to the studio several times a week and just forget about everything else. So thankful I'm no longer working so I can focus on something fun that is just for me! Hang in everyone. For right now, I think I'm just going with the Nioxin products and just let my hair breathe a bit. Diana, I had tried a natural/vegetable hair color and it lasted about 3 days. Several people have recommended Madison Reed so I think I will wait a little while and then try that. Have a great day everyone! <3",

It's filling in well over all the head. When people ask me now how the hair is coming along, I just say I'm doing the Judy Dentch look. But not ready to go bare headed yet. Maybe by June or July... I know as it gets hotter her I'll want to try to go witless. JL, go for it! What have you got to lose? (Sorry, couldn't resist.) Whether you go shorter or not, I think the fun highlights sound fun and may perk your spirits up a bit. I did go with a friend and try on a wig or two before you lose all the hair. I bought one, but then never wore it until after I'd finished both chemo and radiation. Is the top of anyone's scalp tender? Mine is still quite sensitive, similar to before the hair came out. I\"m kind of constantly feeling it or pulling on the top, running my fingers through it, so maybe it's my own fault. Just wondered.",

I'm faced with the same issue of wearing a wig in summer. A friend of mine as super thin thin hair and we met for dinner and she looked amazing. I asked her what she was doing and she confessed she finally bought a \"topper.\" It's just the crown and down a little for bangs. That might be a great option for us through warmer weather. I'd be fine with the sides being short if just the top and front looked longer. I'll look into it and let you all know. I'm wondering if the AI could also be slowing the growth? I've read that can be a side effect. (That along with weight!) It would be so much easier if I just let it all go to hell and not care how I look! Unfortunately, I\"m not wired that way. Yesterday was a really good day at my pottery studio. I've signed up for a special workshop that uses a special kind of firing called obvara. You first fire it in a rake kiln and then plunge it into a mixture of water, salt, yeast, and sugar. So yesterday I did the prep and make 4 big old pots to have ready. I just really love going to the studio and completely forgetting about hair pain etc. I can totally immerse my self and have fun! Hope everyone has a similar thing that can help us get through all this! Happy Saturday! ",

Without any natural lashes as a buffer, the glue etc can cause all sorts of problems. I simply used a good gel eyeliner and some shadow and it wasn't as noticeable. For brows, I used the Benefit thin pencil, Benefit Gimme Brow (like mascara for brows) and then use a Clinique felt tip pencil to add individual hairs to the beginning of the brow for a more natural look. Hate to tell you this, but I lost my lashes after chemo, they came back great, then I've lost about 50% again due to the natural growth process. :-( Rodan and Fields also makes a product very similar to Latisse and is not a prescription. I have several friends who are just totally sold on the product. It's not much cheaper than the Latisse but doesn't require a prescription.",

My hair has grown in fairly full, but is so incredibly slow!!! I think I've tried just about everything on your list, plus the essential oils, Biotin, and vitamins. I honestly think all these products are good products, but your hair will grow back at the rate it decides and there's really nothing we can do to hurry it along. It's my personal belief that all those products make us feel a little better because we feel like we're doing something. It's out of our control though which gets frustrating. I've just now given up the wig and scarves, but because it's so hot now and I can't take the head coverings, not because I love my hair. The bangs and top seem to be the slowest growing.I've had my hair colored a few weeks ago and just the back and sides trimmed a little. The back grows much quicker than the rest. BTW, I didn't use cold caps as I just felt with all the restrictions, I wouldn't be able to go natural anyways; I lost every hair on my body lol! Well, tomorrow is my big day. I go to City of Hope for my first 3-D mammogram, an ultrasound, labs, see my surgeon and my oncologist! Wish me luck. It's a bit nerve-wracking. Oh, here's my hair this morning:  ",

They'll come back again, and it's a process that takes a while to regulate. Mine are doing better, but still go through periods of real thinning and then come back fairly quickly.",

Canadiangirl, I had the cocktail of Cytoxan and Taxoterre. I still remember having to sign the paper that said I acknowledged the possibility that my hair might not grow back. It took forever, and I'm still only trimming the bottom of my hair to get the rest to catch up, but my hair grew back thicker that it was before. Just took so long! Someone finally told me it would be up to 2 years before my hair was back to a PC length. Be patient, take biotin, and just know it absolutely doesn't happen as quickly as we all want and wish for! Hope everyone is doing well and looking forward to the holidays. I look back at my picture from last Thanksgiving when I was still bald as can be and wearing scarves, and feel like it was both a lifetime ago as well as just yesterday. Happy Fall!",

Make sure you use an undercap (I actually have a light cotton terry one) and then I also got a package of those wide stretchy headbands. The headband was the very best discovery for me. Before I used them, I'd get terrible headaches, the wig was itchy and hot and didn't feel secure. You might want to try this. Good luck. If not try a really pretty scarf. Cali had a wedding last summer and posted a picture of the scarf she wore and she looked really beautiful. Maybe you could find her picture or PM her to see what she did.

I ditched the wig again, as the weather hit over 100 and I just couldn't take it anymore. My hair is really thick and super curly, just short. I went in and had my stylist trim the back which grew much faster than the top. My bangs and most of the top is still only about 2 inches long. I've given up worrying. At least I have hair and it seems quite healthy. Like Cali, I'm not sure mine will ever be long again. I had used a natural color, Madison Reed, and it looked great, but then went in and had my hair professionally colored. My grey was patchy and uneven so I evened it out. Feel much better. Whatever makes you feel good about yourself is what you should do. Seq, how was vacation? So very glad you finally decided to go. I have my first mammo, ultrasound, and new labs coming up next week, and I feel like we shouldn't waste any opportunities for fun! Hope wherever you are you're surviving the weather!",

Now waiting one more week for a prosigna test that will give more specific DNA info re need for chemo or not. I'm really learning toward going straight to rads but decided it was worth 1 more week wait to try to get it right. I see so many with much higher onco scores (mine was 20) that I'm not sure I should wait. I\"m only 5 weeks out from surgery though so I guess that's not too bad. I have large amounts of cancer in family; I'm the 6th w bc in 2 generations on my mom's side. Nice to see all the different choices and be able to tap into other's decision making process. Thanks.",

Prior to the lumpectomy, They took me to the nuclear medicine section and did two processes. First, the radiologist numbed the area and then I had a small plate mammogram to determine exactly where the tiny clip from the biopsy was located. The radiologist then inserted a tiny thin wire to guide the surgeon to the tumor. When she was finished I looked down and saw a tiny wire sticking out of my breast a few inches. I asked the tech if it just stayed like that and how did I put my gown back on. She said, Oh I have a cover for that I'll put on. She came back with an opaque plastic dixie cup which she taped to my breast. I laughed and said, Oh good, now I look like Madonna! After that, the radiologist did also inject 4 needles with the radioactive dye which would travel to the nodes so the surgeon could remove the sentinel nodes. It all wasn't really too bad in the big picture. Hope this helps, I, too, didn't really know the process and think it helps to know what's going on. Once the wire was in, I had no pain whatsoever from it. All was removed during the lumpectomy. I'm sorry you have to go through this again. I highly recommend you sign on to the Lumpectomy Lounge thread, and Summer Rads thread. Both can help you with a wealth of information and support. Dara",

We all know how frightening this journey is, and I can tell you while it certainly isn't easy, we are all stronger than we think, and you can all do this. I found this forum so helpful and supportive, and it really helped me get through it all. I did lose my hair, actually within 2 weeks of my first infusion. I had a wig ready, but found my head was just too sensitive for wigs and found scarves were far more comfortable. I did also use the neulasta pod and did experience bone pain for a few days. I did also get the mouth sores etc, but all of these side effects pale in comparison to having cancer. I wanted to make sure I threw everything at it to ensure me being around a long time from now. I am now 1 year out from finishing treatment, AC+T every three weeks for 4 cycles and then 36 radiation treatments. The most important thing to remember is that every single person is different and reacts differently to treatment. Take one day at a time and surround yourself with positivity and calm. Cut yourself slack at each step, and focus on YOU. Be prepared for people to not know what to say, to say really stupid things, and for you to find out who truly cares. This is one rough road to have to walk, but lean on the people here; they'll become closer than you can imagine, even though you may never meet in person. Hang in there, you can do this. There are so many here to help you through it! Dara",
