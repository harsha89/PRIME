I don\u2019t have any details yet. But according to the radiation therapist who is my neighbor, it will probably start a couple of weeks after my appt. she\u2019s told me that I can\u2019t use any lotions, deodorants, wear loose shirts, no bra as much as possible. But being that I\u2019m a little larger, I have to wear one in public, so have been looking at the other boards for ideas. And it looks like other RO\u2019s are okay with certain lotions. itS All very confusing. So glad to meet you all.",

I am a tad larger, so I've got some irritation under my breast and under my arm. It's been pretty uncomfortable and no matter what bra I wear, it makes it worse. And even bra-less there is some irritation. I found this powder gel by Monistat. https://www.target.com/p/monistat-chafing-relief-powder-gel-1-5-oz/-/A-14774551?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=bing_pla_df&CPNG=PLA_Health%2BBeauty%2BShopping&adgroup=SC_Health%2BBeauty&LID=700000001230728pbs&network=s&device=c&querystring=monistat%20anti-chafing%20gel&gclid=[*GCLID*]&gclsrc=ds I found it Meijer, but looks like it's readily available. After letting my lotion soak in, I've put a dime side on my sore axillary area, and another dime under the breast. It's really made things much more comfortable. Just sharing and hope someone finds this helpful! XOXO ",

I see the doc tomorrow, so I'll ask him about it, but I'll probably still use it whether he okays or not. :D Today I had to wait an hour to be seen, but the others in the waiting room says that's not normal; that usually there's no more than a 10 minute wait. So, hoping every day won't be like today. So far, no pain, no feeling at all. I am tired, but I think it's a stress tired. I'm finding sleep somewhat elusive these days. I tried today to imagine that I was laying topless on a beach - but it didn't work that well. Between the cold air blowing and the machine noise, my imagination just ain't that good!!! Now maybe if they served Margaritas along with radiation...",

Lack of sleep makes me very emotional, so I needed to sleep so I could make decisions. He prescribed me with Xanax, and I've been taking it off and on since April. I know in my head I need to discontinue it, but if I don't sleep, I just can't be rational. I don't know if it's the Tamoxifen that causing the continued sleeplessness or just the general state of stress (which I feel has lessened since June). I have a routine appointment with Family Practice in October, so I'm going to discuss it with him then. I want him to review all my treatment and make his own recommendations for the \"whole\" me. I need someone to look at the \"big picture\" of my health with me; not just focus on the cancer, which will all have been treated by then. ",

I'm a little disappointed, because I wanted to get it over with, but I know it's for the best. The last two days, the emotions of this ordeal has hit me again. I am so tired I can hardly keep my eyes open, and I feel on the verge of tears again. I know it's just stress. On top of this, my twin daughters (my only children) move off to college next week.

I saw some people on the boards had tried Coobie bras and they look really soft, so I ordered a couple to try. I am right between a Full Size and an X Large (X Large is bigger than Full Size). I ordered one of each. I tried on the Full Size and it does feel wonderful. Very soft, doesn't poke anywhere. But a little snug, so I probably do need the X Large. CONS (so far) -- they pull over your head (not a fan) pads have to be taken out when you wash them Pros (so far) -- very soft have a pad for modesty and shape shape isn't bad at all for a non-underwire bra Inexpensive - $22 to $26 each I got them at ShopCoobie.com. I received them 6 days after ordering. Just sharing in case someone else is looking for comfort as well. Blessings to you all!",
