    "Content": "PuddlePuffin wrote: ok so I had a mammogram, ultrasound and a fine needle biopsy 9 days ago after finding a lump ( I have another post about waiting and stress etc with all the details in , so I won't go over everything again) since then I have been told that blood or any shade of pink / red is bad news generally. This was a nurse and radiographer, plus a friend and my aunt who's had BC. Is this true? Mine was bright pink and blood streaked. The nurse said they are happy to see any colour basically but not pink / red. She said green, yellow, white, black etc but not red . Can someone confirm this or are these people just going from their own experiences? Can blood in the biopsy be ok? My results are in and I need to go to the breast surgeon to be given them . I had been told by the clinic that if it was not of concern to them they would ring me and let me know, so to get the dreaded appointment letter was a big worry this morning. Log in to post a reply",
