I decided to have a double mastectomy, with immediate recon, DIEP procedure (I'm excited about that part, but not looking forward to the recovery). I'm getting so nervous!!! I got so much shopping/preparing after reading all the tips for post op. I was just diagnosed in July, and the waiting part has been KILLING me! I'm glad I finally have a surgery date. I wish all my October girls a speedy recovery! God Bless :)",
