I'm 27 and a mummy of 2 and still breastfeeding my youngest who is 14 months but he's close to stopping. I recently noticed my left breast has changed in texture I wouldn't say dimpling but it looks like large pores if you know what I mean. This is over most the top of my breast then I've noticed under my nipple is definitely indented when I lift my arm. I dont feel any type of lump and my great grandma had breast cancer. I know I'm breastfeeding but I really don't feel like this is the cause and I am SO worried because the earliest doctors appointment I can get is 2 weeks away. Sorry for the long post I know none of you can diagnose what this is but I needed to tell someone before I worry myself too much with the wait to the doctor. I'm also worrying they will fob me off saying its because I'm breastfeeding and because I'm still young. Log in to post a reply",

I live in the UK and we can't go to the hospital unless it's an emergency or we get referred by the doctor so I'm just going to have to wait although I have been ringing to see if there are any cancellations. Although I'm thinking positive it really is making me anxious. Reading the posts here makes me feel better though. Thanks ladies :)",
