The bottom at the back and the parts at the sides are sticking out and really long and messy. How did you deal with cutting your hair while waiting for it to grow out? I'm so nervous to even trim it because I want to grow it long again and don't want to slow down the process. If I clean up the back and sides, will it start to grow out nicely/more evenly, or will I just keep running into this problem again every couple months? Do I just need to deal with it for a few months while it's in its awkward phase?Right now I am just wearing hats constantly because I don't know what else to do with it! I liked it a lot better when it was shorter, a few months ago... but I don't want it to be short forever. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

I was hoping some of you could give your experience with radiation and how you felt while you were being treated. I'm used to chemo completely destroying me where I can't do much of anything, but I know radiation does not have the same side effects. Were you still able to carry on with some activities throughout treatment? Mild exercise, social activities, etc? What were the main side effects for you? Was the fatigue bad? Hoping not nearly as bad as chemo where I could barely stand up on some days! Thanks for your help. Log in to post a reply",

The time that works looks like it will be about 2 weeks and a bit after my last treatment. Was anyone still dealing with anything major at that point? My doctor seemed fine with it, said she's had patients go away pretty much the next day. It would be a hot/beach vacation, so I know I'd have to cover up the radiated area when in direct sun, but I'm more of a shade person anyway. Just need some MAJOR R&R. I had the same vacation planned last year and had to cancel it when I was diagnosed. I'm so excited about the idea of booking it again... but also a bit nervous since it got cancelled the first time! Thanks for your help.",

All of that sounds way more manageable than what I've been going through with my chemo side effects, so I'm definitely not dreading it as much as I did the start of chemo. Actually just looking forward to getting it done with. I am young and don't have children, and I'm on leave from work which I'll probably continue through radiation since it won't be too much longer at that point... so luckily I should be able to rest as much as needed. I will have to start looking into the best types of lotions and all that, although I assume my rad onc is probably going to have her recommendations before we start. Janetanned- I like the idea of having your own hospital gowns... fun! I hate the gowns so much, didn't even think about the fact that I'll have to wear those.",

If I go on vacation 3 weeks after my final treatment, am I still likely to be badly burned at that point? (if I do get a bad burn during my treatment, that is) And also, for anyone who was in the sun/went swimming after radiation... what kind of swimsuit did you wear to cover up? I'm having trouble finding swimsuits online that provide coverage above the breast area that aren't super sporty or ugly looking! I guess wearing a swim shirt is also an option.",
