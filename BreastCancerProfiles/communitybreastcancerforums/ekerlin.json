    "Content": "Nov 12, 2007 02:50AM ekerlin wrote: I have metastatic breast cancer that spread to my lymphatic system, concentrated mostly in my chest, thorax and neck region.  My oncologist has tried various chemo regimes and I am currently on Cycloblastin tablets (Cyclophosphamide).  I had previously been on Xeloda tablets with no effect.  I had a PICC line in for over 6 months, but when they tried to change it last week, they couldn't find a 'good' vein - I've had so much chemo in the past 2 years that all the veins are 'shot'.  Hence I am back on tablets instead of IV.  I've also got a whole lot of surface tumours on the skin covering my entire left breast, neck and shoulders which I am about to have treated with radiotherapy.  So there was no way the onc would authorise a port line to the chest (which would be an alternative to a PICC line).  So I'm feeling a bit cornered in at present.  I've been on treatment of one sort or another since July 2005 and am getting thoroughly sick of it!  Sorry - starting to feel sorry for myself.  Time to think of others.  Best of luck sockmonkey, not sure if my experience is similar to yours, or of any help to you - hope all goes well for you.
