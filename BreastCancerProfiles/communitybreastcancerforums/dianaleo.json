Although no one wants to be here, there is a lot of information and support here.  When I was first diagnosed with BC stage III in 1996 I did not drink diet anything.  I became stage IV in 2009 and probably drank 1-2 diet cokes a day.  I mentioned it to my onc, but he didn't seem concerned at all.  Did not tell me to stop.  I think we all look to what might have contributed to our BC but perhaps none of it matters.  I never smoked, drank very much, was not overweight, have never had much food with preservatives, no family history, had regular mammograms and here I am - stage IV.  I cannot think how I could have prevented this.  I had a friend who was diabetic and drank excessive amounts of diet drinks - almost like a chain smoker - never had BC - but did succumb to heart disease from the diabetes.  Of course the best thing to do is speak to your onc about it.  I thought perhaps stress had brought mine back, but my onc just said it could be, but no one knows at this point and everyone has stress in their lives - kids, finances, spouses, jobs, etc.  Let us know what your onc thinks.",

Generally, I take a pain pill and keep going, but this whole thing sucks - there are days when I have a very hard time getting out of bed and facing the day.  I am on anti-depressant, but I guess it can only help so much.  There, I haven't been of help or comfort to anyone, but it felt good putting it down on paper. ",

I have been having this since about July, but neither oncologists suggested this dx.  The rheumatologist was able to eliminate a lot of things just by seeing where the actual pain is and the severity of it in specific spots. My regular pain killer, oxycodone, does very little for the pain.  I was given a presc. NSAID (ibupropen), but that caused my creatine to go up as I only have one kidney so I stopped that and it really didn't help that much.  I understand that surgery is the best treatment - but I'm not sure what that involves yet.  I have an appt. with hand surgeon on Feb. 14. In the meantime, between going onto a chemo, progression, rising tumor markers, pain and unusable wrists I am wallowing in self-pity, but a xanax or two will put me back in a conquering mood.

My onc gives me oxycodone which like K-Lo gives me energy to clean and do stuff, but I'm not sure that is the best thing to be on at this time.  I need about 3 a day.  I'm going to have a more in depth discussion about this with my onc next time.  He usually is very good at listening to me, but he just says it's from the cancer, meds, or aging or all of the above and kind of dismisses it.  I may see a pain specialist just to see what he thinks",

I have read that it takes a while for the xeloda to start to show in the markers.  It took 5 months on Faslodex before my numbers stopped rising, stabilized and then dropped somewhat.  My markers were rising when yours were - the last time they only rose ten points in a month which actually was good news to me.  It was weird that my markers here were 171, but 135 at JH a couple days later so between the two oncs they couldn't tell if they were going up or stablilizing.  Dr. Emens asked me not to get them done here this month to avoid confusion.  Nothing showed up on scans, but I kind of think something is going on - just not visible yet.

Livingit, with all that you have been through and going through I think you are amazing - a 3 year old - are you kidding me?  I hope you have some better days this summer - it is such a strain being tired and achy all the time - it really wears on you, physically and emotionally.  If you are not on antidepressants or anti-anxiety meds, ask your onc about them - they do help.  I also take about 3 oxycodone a day to cope.  Keep us posted and feel free to rant whenever it gets too overwhelming.  We are here to listen.

One of my outlets is to take my dog to the dog park as I really can't walk her very much any more.  It has been a good social outlet for me also as there are a bunch of us that go during the week when it is quieter and not so many weekend macho men and their dogs.  Actually, in this colder weather the dogs seem to enjoy it more and are more active.  I will go any day when weather is above 26.  I would guess that  the added leg-nerve pain is just enough to send you over the edge on top of all the other crap that goes with this disease.  The pallitive care dr. sounds like a good idea, but definitely an antidepressant is in order.  I take oxycodone for pain and was very afraid I would become an addict. My onc assured me that patients with real pain are not likely to over medicate-so far he is right.  With all my drugs, I just take what I need to get through the day.  So run, don't walk to get the help you need.  I think you'll be glad you did!

I have a very similar profile to yours - ILC, no nodes, Er +, Pr - or + (bone biopsy showed pr-, but original dx showed pr +, onc says probably pr+ as bone biopsy is not as reliable as paraffin test), HER2-, mets to hip, cervical spine, and skull, and my dog looks very similar to yours! If it is any comfort to you, I have done well.  First dx in 1996, mets in 2009 with very little progression so far.  I did arimidex for a year and now am on Faslodex which seems to be working well.  I have aches, pains and fatigue, mostly from meds I think but life has gone on a little less than normal, but manageable.  Best wishes to you. ",

Lexapro) and I take the anti-anxiety med only when I am truly anxious (ie, before scans mostly).   My psychiatrist just added Deplin which I understand is a kind of folate that cross the brain/blood barrier.  I think it has helped a lot with my general well being.  At the same time I stopped taking Lipitor so that could also be the reason I feel better.   I feel if there was ever a time to use these drugs it is now.  I'm not the least bit ashamed of telling anyone about them.  I have always been a very strong person, never relying on any crutches to get me through rough times, but with this one I'm smart enough to know when I need help.",
