My tumor (the largest) was 11cm so i was ONLY given the choice of BMX or MX. I figured that with stage 4 i dont want to get an implant to later find the cancer has returned and lurked under the dang thing for awhile and have to undergo another surgery. So i opted for No recon... then because i was only going to have 1 boob, i opted to have them both removed to give myself a sense of symmetry. ANd i am loving my FREEDOM! (i was a 34e natrually before cancer so it was a whole lotta booby that i no longer have) PS a great reason to shop for new clothes ;)",

If in doubt always ask for an orbital scan, BUT I WILL SAY THIS- this eye thing is apparrntly rare! So more than likely you are fine. I do have double vision but my eyesight is still 20/20. Annatomy lesson- your eye musccles are as thick as a regular pen, mine because of the cancer and inflamation is swollen to about twice that, the drs literally said as a sausage lol! All- thank you so much for all your kind and loving words. To the famous question posed about the glass sitting on the table 1/2water and 1/2 air- is my glass half full or half empty? I see my glass as 100% FULL because after all air is matter and thats all that matters ;)",

But because at that time i was unaware of what estrogen was, or phytoestrogens or any of all that i ate a ton of soy products! soy milk, soy meat substitutes soy everything! When it was discovered that i had ER+ breast cancer my dr told me to stay away from foods that are recommended to supplement estrogen in women going into menopause (soy beans top that list). As the loss of estrogen is what causes a lot of the symptoms like hot flashes and such, the recommended foods and creams to help balance that out. he (my oncologist) said \"even though your on an anti estrogen medication, its best to avoid those foods\" he also said \"At stage 4 your diet isnt going to 'cure' you as a lot of other people claim, but if you were one of my stage 1 patients i would say a well balanced diet would be beneficial\"  It is my belief, due to my diet, i basically fed my cancer. That is probably why at age 26 i found a lump, that more than likely was already stage 4. I recently went back to my dr that delivered my 1st daughter. I hadnt seen her since 2005 and she was FLOORED to hear that i had breast cancer, she said the last visit i haD with her was sept 2005 i was there complaining about a burning sensation in the EXACT SAME SPOT THAT MY 11CM MASS WAS. Pregnancies cause our estrogen levels to go sky high, so i first felt that sensation that i also felt for months before my dx a few months after having my daughter, then all through nursing her it was fine... i get pregnant with my second child and once again these symptoms arise. Within 2 years of having my son i was dx'd with having stage 4 cancer.... Any connection???? ANd yes the articles do contradict each other. I was taking a nutrition course in college last yr and for our final we had to put together a PowerPoint presentation regarding a disease that is related to diet, i of course chose to do mine on breast cancer. i had access, through my college, to a ton of journals of different studies from the US, Sweden, Japan that all basically concluded the same thing \"dietary estrogens act like natrual estrogens\" but the results were so different. there are so many factors that they brought up such as those that ate soy products as children (many asian countries that is a staple) seemed to be protected from the plant based estrogen and had a lower occurrence of estrogen related cancer. (breast, prostate and ovarian) ANyhow i could go on for hours from what research i found!  But the fact is our breast cancer cells mutate when those cells develop- the smallest part of breast development is in utero the second, which is where most of the breast cancer cells develop is between the ages of 8-18, after that age there is very little cellular changes (not sure if i am wording any of this right LOL) but anyhow THOSE are the times where changing a diet is key. Researches have yet to isolate the causes of why a mutated cell is \"turned on\" I miss being a vegetarian, i love the taste and texture of meat (hence the eating meat like products) But like Janice pointed out meat makes me feel sluggish. I seldom eat beef. it mostly chicken breast or pork. I used to juice more frequently than i do now, but its due to finaces more than anything. But having a healthier diet is NEVER a bad idea. LizLemon (btw i just got that reference as i started watching 30rock maybe a month ago LOL)- I was totally that person you were describing, i did EVERYTHING i was supposed to do, nursed both my babies for 2 years, didnt smoke or drink, ate healthy, exercised, when i was DX'd my family remarked \"how did YOU of all people get cancer? You dont even drink soda!\" (thats a big thing down here- they have 3 liter cokes!) SO yeah there is no sure fire way to prevent it or cure all out there. Bilateral- You brought up something- Mushrooms! I totally forgot in my research i discovered some studies they were doing on mushrooms that worked like an aromatase inhibitor... It was still in the baby stages of being researched, but it was interesting! BTW i was looking at hiring a nutritionist and the two certified ones in my area had NO clue as to the effects of estrogen on cancer, since that was my only gray area in my diet i chose to just research on my own. Spam that another thing, some of us experience weight gain from our treatments- i gained 40+ pounds. Diet will def help curb some of that! So back to you Brandall LOL- Do dont stress over what you're eating, the stress alone can feed your cancer. Eat what you feel comfortable about. Of course no one can live on eating just candy bars and chocolate milk the whole lives. Balance it out. ",

I love my title as a figher though, I hit the ground running as soon as I heard it was bc as I assume you all did too!  All the monies that the \"pnk parade\" raised that goes to research and finding an over all cure is unbelieveable. They make everything imaginable in pink and more often than not a portion of the proceeds goes to research. Herceptin has prolonged the life expactancy for so many within the last few years and I hope to live long enough to be benifited from current research that hasn't hit the market yet. I was given the orginal (statistical) prognosis of 18 months. And was told by my dr that it wouldnt be out of the relm of posiblity to live another 10 years. I dont buy for a second thats ALL the time I have left! I intend to strech this 18 months into well over 18 years! I want to see my children grow and become adults and have their own children. We have every right to be angry at the hand we were dealt! We needn't blame ourselves because i know damn well I didint \"do anything\" to deserve this! I am gonna remember the day OCT 13TH and celebrate the hell out of it ;) Edited to add- WE need to be the educators of our communities, I proudly wear my bladness, dont hide my port and I am asked daily about my situation. Most are under the assumtion that after chemo i will be better and I happily inform them that although i might be better for a time, there is always the possiblity of a reoccurance and I am going to be living with cancer as long as I live. So lets spread the word, if not who will?",

What are we black clouds? I think most of us take our dx in stride and try to live our lives to the fullest we can! Um yeah it upsets me about Oprah because they is so much she could do she has milions of viewers!!!! Had I seen a show saying how young women get bc too and in fact some of them are stage 4! Believe you me i would have found a new dr! (for nearly a yr my dr kept sweeping me under the rug and saying my lump and other issues were soley breast feeding related and so i was ignorant and BELIEVED her! turns out nope it was BC and oh by the way in the yrs time it went unchecked and SPREAD!) okay sorry a little angry and the slug that calls herself a DR! Anyhow my point being i thought i was doing the right thing by going to my dr and i thought she was correct in saying \"you're young and bf its prob nothing\" HAD I KNOWN THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS STAGE 4, AND THAT YOUNG WOME DO GET DX WITH BC EVERYDAY I WOULD HAVE SOUGHT A SECOND OPINION A LOT SOONER!!!! on a lighter note- lets not diminish the other women's fight as well. they might fight as long as us,  or as hard, but it still sucks. I am currently going through chemo and on hte august chemo board htere are plenty of \"early stagers\" tht seem to have a lot worse SE than myself, age may have a big part in that (i am only 27, so am more resilant i guess) I do not like to think as my stage IV as a death sentence, although i have ocme to terms with the fact that i may not see my kids grow up, get married and have their own kids. They are 2 and 5 now and that by far is the WORSE part of all this. Goodness i cant see through my tears to type lol... Everyday is a new day and i can only go on living like i have been and try to see the joy in ALL THINGS Also thought i'd add- my sister in law did a fundraiser for me and we raised quite a bit (a little over 5 gs) And because my chemo only costs X amount of dollars she decided she wanted to give back $1100 to her co-workers! Well i told her do what you want cuz it wasnt about the $... SHe actually started emailing my friends that she thought i was faking it! then she said that i was exaggerating my condition and \"cancer is cancer no matter the stage why embellish\" she actually- no lie- sent the police to my chemo treatment! She later showed up and i allowed my dr to discuss with her my dx, and tx... she apologized and gave my onco the check (i found out later that she came back after i was gone and got angery that they gave it to me LOL) ANyhow so she went onto facebook and posted these nasty things- i meant totally undeserved things. One of her comments was \"tims (thats me lol) dr said it would totally devistate her to know but she only has 2 or 3 years to live\" right there i realised what an effin Beeoch she was and have NOT nor will i EVER speak to her again, even if we are at the same family gathering i will not give her the time of day! she has called and texted me on many occations. My point being is she thought all breast cancer was the same and she didnt see the fact that even though 1 part of my tx will cost X there are so many more things i will FOREVER be going through. from scans to meds to EVERYTHING! for me this if going to be life long! So IGNORANCE is WIDESPREAD!",

I am sorry to hear of your mom's passing- i know that can be hard. I lost my dad in feb and sometimes i still wonder about all of his health concerns and \"what-if\" it til i cant think straight! My opinion comes more from fact. Cancer is unpredictable, in one person they may loose their appetite and loose a lot of weight in another person they may eat more. My lung mets have been really funny in the way they started off as spots or growths in my lung, i did treatment and they didn't show up on the scan anymore. then they showrd up on my scans as what appears to be bronchitis, my cancer literally grew back as a film that was coating only my right lung. Basically i was being suffocated by the cancer cells. I couldn't breath and kept going to the dr, they tried many antibiotics until none of them worked. they got a biopsy and confirmed it was cancer! Go figure! The cancer was presenting in an atypical manner so it fooled the Drs from august til last month! So my point is cancer doesnt have only one way of presenting itself and only one set of signs or symptoms. It effects everyone differently and although some of us my share symptoms there are many that dont share any!",

Cheer up :) LadyinBama- That same sister in law that is doing everything also set up a facebook site for me where she gets on and updates nearly daily so most my freidns and family get on there and check. It sorta wears you ut ot have to repeat the same story over and over! Sometimes i catch myself saying did i tell you this part or that, because i honestly dont remember! Lisaattheshore- i think you're right it means more coming from ppl that you really dont expect anything from. So nice for your friends to show up at the hospital and be with your husband.",

I also get some encouriging words, it does make us feel united! ALso those are great!!! I am gonna find one that says chemo sucks! Wherria- Sounds like your family is a bunch of FIGHTERS! its in your blood girl! i know you'll beat this! Lizzy- I have a 1 scar over my port and one on my neck and thats it, the tubes kinda bulge a little over my collar bone and near the neck scar... kids ask whats that a lot LOL I used to use 100% glycerine soap but stopped, dont ask why LOL when i was in the hospital they gave me baby shampoo that was very mild but somehow it got in my mouth (i guess without hair it just srota went everywhere lol) it was not pleasant omaz- i have read anti-cancer i found it to be very informative i took some of the advice to heart (like certian foods that are high in anti-oxidents) But the author recently had a reoccurance of his cancer (i had the latest edition with an updated preface) so it made me think either he didnt take his own advice or it doesnt work as well as the book says... BOTTOM LINE ITS BETTER TO EAT HEALTHIER NO MATTER WHAT THOUGH!!! Calamatykel- you're onto something with the pain and emotional state correlation- my onc did tell me the better your attitude the less SE you'd have.... Next tx you'll do much better cuz you'll have gotten used to your port! Iowasue- i did have a nice weekend took the kids swimming, tried to tan my uber white bald head LOL i am in South TX so its not quite feeling like fall yet! Sorry to hear about your headaches! Hopefully its something minor that can be easily fixed! Good luck to all that are doing chemo this week! you're in my thoughts and prayers!!!!",

Went ot my onc today and he is gonna send me for a CT scan of my head (and the rest of my body cuz i was coming up due in 2 weeks anyhow) to find the root cause of my headaches. He agrees my vision may be muscle fatigue of the eye but he wants to dig deep to find whats causing that wether its med related, cancer realted or just plain aging! then i went to my surgeon. Said its not lymphadmia but the swelling and tenderness is prob a SE of radiation as it damages the lymph system sometimes. So that was good news. He said if in 3-6 months my \"dog ears\" still are bothering me he can get them off, but it may take that long or longer for them to return to normal- still healing and all that Went to the hospital for my MUGA and i got there at 10, my appointment was at 1 but i wouldnt have been able to make it back to alice in time to pick up my daughter from school and they said they will fit me in. Well i was waiting for an hr there (with my 3 yr old mind you) when they finally called me back. then they have no clue where they are supposed to send me, talking about day surgery and i am telling her i am NOT there for surgery it is like an U/S on my heart.... they finally figure out where i am supposed to go then they proceed to tell me that WONT be able to fit me in, i was like well you had me waiting for over an hour that would have been nice to know then! The gal got rude and i told her flat out i HAVE to be back home by 3- its a 3 hr drive from san antonio so at the very latest i can LEAVE san antonio at 12 so i can NOT be seen at 1. SHe was like then reschedule for another day- i said no i live freakin 3 hours away i am not coming back, i had enough of her attitude so i told her i will take my business ELSEWHERE. (so they just lost a few thousand dollars) I didnt have the patience to be dicked around by a know it all administrator... Oh yeah and CRAPPY news is i called to schedule for the enterance exam for the nursing program this week and they said that they stopped testing in APRIL, last time i called they said they would be testing in march, april and MAY... so needless to say i cant start this yr which delays me a year and it pisses me off cuz these barley out of highschool people that they hire dont know jack and they just give out wrong information like it doesnt affect those that they give it to.... A friend suggested i take some of their classes like biology and such this yr so i can get a leg up for next yr- i might do that. i wish i didnt live in such a HICK town! sorry for the vent it has been a LONG day- luckily i dont have any plans for tomorrow, but monday i have 3 appointments.... Oh ones the look good feel good meeting lol i cant wait!!!! gonna get my sexy on! (too bad DH is gonna be away at a SWAT training thing til next sat!)",

Praying it goes away on its own.. Yeah white is bad- mostly i stick with brown rice and whole grains but when eating out or premade foods thats not always possible. I have NEVER eaten white bread til i met my husband. I was like what the heck is this LOL- i eat it at very rare occations (like when i am with his family and they are making the meal)  My mom had us on wheat since forever- i actually dont care for white bread at all... But i KNOW i am getting sugars from soda- b4 cancer i NEVER drank soda ever but after cancer i sorta let my self placed diet restrictions fly out the window!",

VBS starts at the end of the month but only for 4 days :( and tech she isnt old enough to go because she doesnt turn 6 til a week after its over but they said she can go (YAY!) For her age group they dont do playoffs, but they do an all start team that she didnt make (no worries i was ready for a kickball break) Debbi glad to hear about taylor! WHat great news. Carolyn- It sounds to me that its not your son that is having the problem making friends (espcially if he is using the paper doll as a playmate) Its the other kids that seem to alienate him- which is so sad cuz kids can be so cruel. But for the teacher to have said that they've tried and kids can be so cruel, thats appalling! She obviously isnt trying hard enough. I went to school with a girl that had spina bifida and she was in a wheelchair. We NEVER treated her any diffrently and i think it was because they (the school) never made a big deal out of it  Also  I think its up to the parents to educate their kids on respectable behavior towards other children.  Is there any possiblity of getting him into another school? Me, personally i would lodge a complaint against the teacher for taking the matter into her own hands without discussing it with y'all or giving you any indication that something was wrong. Espcially at these early years where 1 bad experince can set the whole tone for his education here on out. Good luck and sorry to hear that he is having a bad time at school.",

Let me explain LOL So like you Kel i want to do something fun even though money is tight right now, so I went to the bank (which is a bank inside walmart) to exchange my loose change for dollar bills. My bank has a machine like coinstar that you are able to use for FREE if you are an account holder, so i go there yesterday with my bag'o'money and the machine was off. So i wait in line to speak with a teller and i was told \"the machine is full and can not accept any more money, the woman that is trained to empty it doesn't get on shift til 2:30- come back after 4:30 and it should be emptied.\" I ask the teller if it would be possible for her to exchange some of my change so i will be able to pay for gas. (Embarrassing to pay with quarters!) She asks me \"how much change are we talking?\" i reply \"just $10 worth\" her freakin reply \"OH NO THATS WHAT THE MACHINE IS FOR!\" in my head i am thinking what the heck you work at a bank and cannot compute that 4 quarters equal a dollar! So needless to say i came back after 4:30- to find the stinkin machine wasnt emptied! 3 yes 3! of the tellers were NOT behind the partition, but out in front of the bank- more like in walmart handing out fliers to the customers to join the bank for $1! By this point i was fed up! I asked the 3 women \"why isnt the machine emptied? i was told to come back at this time\" 1 of them said \"oh it will be emptied by tomorrow morning\" I said \"then how come you can't give me bills for my change?\" I explained to them what happened earlier. One of the other girls said \"i can give you $1 for 4 quarters.\" Really, really! You are a bank employee and are only allowed to exchange change for 1 dollar? How the heck am i gonna get any gas for $1 when a gallon is over $3! Seriously that ticked me off- i am thinkin my bank is filled with a bunch of morons! So yes i can see a robber getting away with money from the drive thru! LOL Amish- i was flipping through channels last night and i am not sure what one it was but they had a program about these amish kids (they must have been in England or something though because of the \"worldy\" kids had accents) what i did appreciate was the girls (had to be in their teens) Saw some of the behavior of the worldy boys and the remarked that they were acting really immature, also they pointed out that they dont drink and such. I keep thinkin about Kingpin lol that movie was hilarious!",

My all time favorite movie that i could watch unendingly is drew barrymore's \"ever after\" great movie- not an oscar winner in the least but i love it! oh yeah i love feeling the sweat pooling down my back after zumba, actually DH's work schedule didnt allow me to make the classes for a while and i just got back into them... although on tue last week my hip popped out of its socket- not fun at all!!!!! ",

Re:eyebrows i used to have a serious uni-brow LOL, well not as bad as my sisters but noticible if i didnt maintain it because of my dark hair, anyhow literally in the last few months 1 or 2 pesky hairs have been growing back, other than that they have remained thinned out- and to think all i needed was chemo and i was paying to have them threaded or waxed LOL! (gotta look at the bright side sometimes!) LOL Kel- So glad you posted! Good hearin from ya! Loved the video- you know what would be hilarious??? Putting those mini football helments on them and having them run around, they reminded me of young kids that are learning the game and run ALL over the field! Too cute, when my babes get home from school tomorrow i def am gonna show them that! Our chickens LOVE grasshoppers, now thats a funny site to see! them going to peck one and it JUMP away... Sadly we are down to less than 5, our dog is getting old so he hasnt been detering all the preditors- barking only does so much, but once the coyotes and whatever else out there realsies this dog isnt gonna get up and chase you away you've got a free meal!!! We did (well my sister-in-law did) get a new puppy, but he's still in the training phase and sees the chickens as play things LOL.... WHAT A MESS!!!! but our veggies are comming in nice! Cool i am gonna look into the wading pools- we do our taters in a deep pit that we spent so much time digging, prob is when we get rain (the rare occations that we do) it over wets that area, wading pools cheap and convienient! Thanks for sharing! Rachel- Thanks- those were some of my favorite shots too- Oh fuuuuuunnnnny story- so my husband wants to go visit BC- lol just realised BC here means a whole other thing than british columbia. Okay when he was stationed in WA he wasnt allowed to leave the US because they were doing this on call thing where they couldnt be more than 2 hrs away because if they were called in (it was a readiness drill) anyhow  i am losing my train of thought- okay so he hasnt visited canada ever and wants to go. British columbia is very pretty- love Victoria etc... anyhow so my husband was like \"what if we visit Toronto, British Columbia\" I was like \"WHAT??? you mean ontario right?\" He totally just assumed ALL canada was B.C. because him growing up down here closer to mexico he never knew much about canada. i had a good laugh explaining to my husband about providences and such LOL AGING!- i dont think i look much older unless i looked 12 going into this LOL, because i get the \"OMG how old are you?!?!?!?!\" nearly everytime i visit my oncologist. But i def FEEL older!!!!!  Iowa- Glad to see that you're away from the boards for a POSITVE thing! Keep it up woman! (but of course still check in!) Lizzy- You didnt have road side protection? It is very beneficial, but of course i also didnt buy that this last time as i was on a budget and i have a flat in my Yukon and have to PAY FULL PRICE for a new one, so for the time being its still FLAT!                    SORTA LIKE MURPHY'S LAW!  Cute video- i have seen it but its always worth a second or third look LOL- Puts a smile on my face everytime!!!! ",

They generally have more muscle tone and thus are faster, 5th place is great! And the most important thing is he's beat his PERSONAL best, as long as he is making improvements he will excel!!!  My hair is doing its own thing LOL first it was curly now as its getting longer is just soft waves, i dislike my natrual color which is a medium brown, i prefer black- i have been dying my hair black for the longest time that when my hair grew back after being bald ppl were like \"oh wow your hair color has changed\" LOL little did they know black was not my natrual LOL I have been debating dying it, this time around on chemo there are less chances that it will fall out (only 15-20% lose their hair on this tx) so i dont want to do anything to my hair and help it along that 20% path LOL i know probably not really gonna do anything, but i'll wait....  i just looked up the couch to 5k thing... very cool ",

Also they only used women of european ancestry. I am not sure how that would affect the results, but i imagin it would :)Their conculsion was interesting because it states these results dont directly support the theory, the other site picked it up and reported it more like fact.... biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/13/53/abstract ",

I swear my conditioner prob tastes better than that stuff!!! My opinion about the mastectomy is that you NEED to do whats going to give you peace of mind. If it worries you that you arent getting the MRIs to the point where you're concidering a full mx then that speaks for itself. As for healing time, i thank my speedy recovery to having my aunt fly down to help out with the kids. I didnt lift anything, or really do anything for the first week. Just laid onthe sofa and let other people do what needed to be done. I think had i had to do all that the healing time would have been longer. i got 1 drain out before the week and the second i got out i think the 2nd week check up.  Lizzy thats AWESOME!  i was totally teasin bout the fowl LOL it might be a chicken or something too... That is so gross! ppl these days will do anything for cheap thrills! ANd you're right ppl are attracted to ppl of all sorts of sizes. That guy was so rude to say that.  Mastectomy clothes heck yeah there is profit being made- which to me you're wrong if you go into that business thinking \"oh there are tons of women that need this product i can make tons of money!\" Honestly i didnt get any special clothing, i took an ace bandage and hung it around my neck and pinned my drains to them. you could use just about anything...

Not sure if the fam would be willing to eat it, so may be a while until i make it. We are gonna go CAMPING, leaving early tomorrow, stopping in SA to get my ct scans then heading up north where i hope it would be cooler! if i can find my back up digital camera (not sure if i mentioned i lost my other one last week at chucke e cheese) i will post pictures! ",

Okay so where was I.... Okay about Ming tsai- the episode was about the kids doing a cooking competition his character was the judge... the break they do in the middle of the show (a word from us kids- or something like that) had him showing how to make fried rice i think... His real life son came out in it to, so it was def after he was already famous.  Speaking of famous chefs, i saw this one show cant recall what it was at this moment and a VERY young bobby flay came out on it- very shy didnt have the same camera presence he does now.... VERY HUGE DIFFERENCE! LOL- yeah let me take down my Jong Un poster- How did ya know i secretly have one in my closet??? LOL okay this def is showing my age, but i used to have a MA$E (mase) poster on my wall.... i dont know what i was thinkin LOL Sweeny- Yes i am on FB do you want me to PM you my name? And yes i am feeling really good (aint nothin gonna stop me from spending time with my family)  i have had a few bone scans Rachel is right, thats all there is to it- I also experience pain in my hip that comes and goes and everytime i get scanned there is nothing there. Dr thinks it is chemo  related, from the FIRST chemo i did (taxotere). I know its hard not to worry but TRY not to :) Also i think its wonderful that your dr is going for scans, some get too complacent. I pray its just achy old bones too! Awww Ginger I hate to hear that you're affected so badly! I am glad you got the all is well news though. Funny about your pets, we had this young lab that would chew everything, jump on everything and run faster than i could keep up so he did a lot of dragging me down the street LOL, our vet suggested getting him fixed which we did and it made it WORSE lol, he now is more calm and a really wonderful dog he is 8 (took a few yrs for him to calm down LOL) I SO AGREE RACHEL- ppl say it gets easier but it doesnt I think when they got you in that machine its like re-living the first day! (also not when you're going in for a scan with a specific ache or pain) My reg c/t and echos NO BIG DEAL, when i have those additional scans due to a suspected thing i damn near put myself in a PANIC- and i already am stage 4 for heavens sake!!!! Really our lives will NEVER be the same, no matter how hard we try. the drugs/medication/surgeries all do other things to our bodies which we of course have to rule out as the cancer coming back!!! i feel like i am in a hampster wheel, just going round and round!",

Same with being indoors vd outfdoors- just comes and goes, although it seems like i cant breath if i try to stifle the cough- the coughing is getting so bad its giving me headaches and seeing spots, i mean seriously! LOL My oncologist has listened to my lungs and says \"sounds clear\" I really do miss my old oncologist! I am under care of my PCP who is an internal medicine specialist and he has me on a bunch of crap, antibiotics, cough syrup, steroids, inhaler (which i actually have been on since my lung thing a while back) the results of my xray came in and he called in a new antibiotic- but he wasnt in the office today so the girls couldnt tell me if i was supposed to stop my current ones or add them or what LOL i'll find out tomorrow.... Problem for me with the cough is i have a leaky bladder so you can just imagine!!!!!!!!!!!!! LMBO i had to switch from normal pads to poise ones and oh my goodness i am never going back! Much more comfortable than the regular ones....  Oh and also so strange- my inhaler seems to ALWAYS make me cough worse.... i am gonna bring that up with dr tomorrow. Another sure trigger being in my room (which happens to have my computer in it) i dont have any plants or anything.... hmmmmm the mystery thickens! Sorry rambling on about my cough but i am sitting here coughing up a storm!!!!! Okay so about my wonderfully awesome news- i am no longer doing weekly chemo so hopefully you'll see a lot more of me- instead i get this shot to shut down my ovaries once a month and take amiridex daily. Thank you Lizzy! Maybe tomorrow i'll be back",

Sue sorry i just read your reply. WHat is this new her2 treatment called???? Like i was telling omaz the tykerb is what they use for her2. That was nice that they are going to wait so his friends can be able to attend. Especially at this young age, losing someone is hard, so whomever planned that I give kudos to. No i havent heard of that. I will check into it :) WOW i missed a lot LOL i was going back up to read what i wrote and realized these last couple of posts i was in a rush- SO let me go into details that i missed: The oncologist told me that i have a \"film of cancer\" basically coating my right lung, he said it was odd the way its presenting itself because it isnt growing tumors like cell onto of cell until there is a mass, but its like they are side by side. That is what is causing me breathing problems, it is triggering brochi-asthma (but inhalers arent working) and bronchitis (which numerous antibiotics hasnt helped because it wasnt an infection) He suspects that once i am taking this chemo the side effects of the cancer itself will basically reslove. Which would be nice because i am constantly coughing and wheezing! These medications have very minimal side effects, loose stools, some wierd rash and nausea are the more common things... Nothing i cant handle LOL! That was it basically in a nut shell. Oh and the fact that my cancer isnt estrogen positive anymore was odd- that may be the reason i had progression  on the tamoxofen and on the arimidex.... Leave it up to cancer to mutate against whats attacking it. I think of cancer like a really strong \"antibiotic resistant bacteria\" bacteria is smart enough to change so cancer is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY smart LOL Oh yeah and this rash on my face is an allergic reaction to the tape they used to tape in my oxygen tube while going in with the scope.... Hmmmm it isnt going away yet, but when i had my breast biopsy they put the tape on it and i literally blistered up so i guess my face rash could have been worse! Well gotta get everyone ready for church :)",

Anyhow i only had one month of the Arimidex, since i am going to be back on chemo i do not have to take that any longer. Oh and to clarify i havent had periods since before tx (i had an IUD) but i apparently wasnt menopausal because my gyno did ovary function test, like checking levels and i was fine.  I never got into the office til i watched it here on netflix. One of the perks of being sick sometimes i spending the entire day (while kids are at school) on netflix, just resting.... calling them back as soon as i post this to get any answers!

The medicine is still in your body :) Good luck with the surgery, let us know how you are doing as soon as you're well enough to get on line! My feet are doing so much better! My dr adjusted my medication. I was actually supposed to start my 2 weeks of chemo on Friday, i called the Pharmacy and they hadn't called in my perscription in yet. I am not sure if i posted but i saw my dr on a saturday, he was going to have the nurses call in the script but due to the holidays that hasnt happened. Honestly i am NOT complaining. The blisters on my feet are GONE! it isnt even sore at all! We even took the kids rollerskating this weekend at a rink! (but i am old and my feet were sore by the end of the night LOL) It was fun, but the STRANGEST thing ever: We go on a Friday night and there are at least 50 to 60 kids in the between the ages of 10-15, WALKING! they were walking around the rink in circles like you would a track... i was thinking thee kids are crazy LOL why pay 8 bucks to go skating and then NOT skate... turns out that after 10PM they stop the skating and turn the floor into a dance floor LOL so these kids get there at 7:30 (when they open) walk around in a circle, talking with their friends til 10:00, then they get their dance on LOL. It was the craziest thing i have seen/heard! But on the up side that is probably the most exercise any of these kids have gotten all week! Because it was our first time going there we didnt know, the manager/owner gave us a free pass for all 6 of us (yeah i spent $48 to skate, and that was just the rental!-(i remember when 5 bucks would get me admittion/skate rental, a coke and a slice of pizza- with money left over!) So we'll probably go skating staturday which is geared more towards families. Oh and i must be crazy cuz i am racing my niece playing tag, i am at a full out Apollo Ono speed and fall flat on my butt/head. then slid like 2 feet LOL. I wish it was caught on tape, but it was HILARIOUS! I called the pharm and my dr- no script yet, no answer from the dr.... i am just gonna live it up til the SE come back LOL Lizzy- TOTALLY AGREE SISTA! YOU'RE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR!!!!! our mental attitudes have so much to do with it!!!!! There is this Mandisa song called \"Good morning\" and the first line is \"Wave away my yesterday, cuz i'm leaving it behind me\" this is so my attitude with everything in my life! it has to be or i'd go crazy! www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnmWwudeqfM  <--- here is the video with lyrics Iowa- the flu and a nasty stomach thing is going around here too :(  Debbi- totally LOVE that! Yes we're GONNA! I am listening to that song and now i totally lost my train of thought LOL ENJOY THE DAY LADIES! WHATEVER COMES YOUR WAY!!!!!!! ps cold front i woke up and it was 47 degrees!!!! how did that HAPPEN???? lol",

When i went back home to visit family in the dead of summer (late august) i had to buy a pair of sweat pants and jackets for everyone- we had left 115 degree weather to a nice tempurate 75 LOL me and the kids were so cold, but my family went to ocean shores, the pics are hilarious cuz their kids are wearing swim trunks and mine are wearing jackets and pants!!!!!

So great to hear from you! I think about you often! Rachel- is getting a port an option for you? i feel ya on bad veins girl! my c/t scan friday they couldnt get a vein and had to stick me 3 times! they cant use a port for that because they quickly inject the contrast and it can damage a port... they have reverted to using the backs of my hands because neither arm yields anything for them. I joke and say \"use the vein that is always popping out from my forehead!\" Felisa- Keep on truckin woman! It does get easier for most. It takes our bodies a bit of time to recoup from chemo and radiation. Rachel- thats wonderful news! (graduation to yearly check ups) Lizzy- Yankees??? I totally missed the entire baseball season LOL i dont really pay all that much attention but the mariners are my hometeam! i used to watch them when griffey jr used to play for them up until about A-rod- after that i got into boys LOL IOWA- he is the cutest thing ever! I love that name. I am partial to names that start with a K, do not know why, but i love them- my 2 are both k names and quite a few of our \"runner up\" names were K as well (Kimber, and Kadence were my girl favs) Felisa- I do keep you in my prayers! praying the physical therapy does the trick! Lizzy- the DF study seems a little flawed, because even though some ppl dont have a spouse they can have much more support from fam and friends. Also i think having a spouse has some added stress because you (or at least i do) feel guilty when you have someone other than yourself counting on you \"getting better\". i have terrible guilt when i get sick when he is around because it DEPRESSES him- well my situation may be different because i am stage 4... hmmm too many variables! glad you're on the case- finsd out everything for me! Lady- Sounds like the group is in better hands with you at the helm. I started working out again too. when my husband moves down we are going to start training to run the Rock and Roll marathon here (next years) Ginger- Sounds like you've been through the wringer! Glad you had some quick reacting teachers there for the car accident. Aren't dogs a joy! (i love mine but she jumped on me and made me pull my inner thigh tendon!) And i have noticed they can be big babies glad she wasnt alerting on a danger (ie animal, person). mine barks at the falling leaves as if they are attacking her! Take it easy until you've recovered, 2 things like that back to back! Also very relieved to hear the DGD was safe! Lizzy- I am not doing anything for our month- although i wanted to get this tattoo on my inner wrist for the 15th (metastatic breast cancer day) but the tattoo artist that i gave my art work to never called me back, i am not hunting down someone to do it LOL i will move on to the next guy.... but i kind of need my art work back LOL Plantar warts- My 8 year old had a really bad one that was super painful- we tried at home treatments, didnt work. Went to doctor and it was successfully removed. But the amount of pain she was in- oh my! Lizzy- that isnt a way i have ever thought ppl would target people for a home invasion... i do not actually post much on the web, but SCARY because i know so many people who do! The good/very good and not so good- Hmmm since i am about to turn 31 in a few weeks i say maybe push back mammos to 15, no j/k seriously mammos at 30 sounds great, iu would also like to see drs taking us younger patients more seriously when we voice a concern. NETFLIX- i think you are thinking of the \"pink ribbons inc.\" movie.... but i havent seen the beautiful truth movie so i will check that out. the first one i mentioned is still good. Rachel- So sorry to hear about your mother in law... i will pray for your family especially your boys if thats all right. Palliative care is good because they also help the families as well as the patients through everything. Lizzy- that petition seems like a wonderful idea. Too many women slip between the cracks when they are \"too young\"- i have seen first hand cancer doesn't care if you're 80 or 30 when it strikes. Sadly there is a growing group of woemn on the atage 4 boards that are 30 or younger and have eerily similar stories to my own! Guns/shooting- we have had guns for as long as we've been married and i honestly have only shot them a handful of times, but they do make a lady feel safer. my husband \"tests\" me- seriously tries breaking into the house to see my reaction. i have always \"passed\", which is to say have gotten a gun, and prepared to use it. once my oldest was only a few months old, he pulled that stunt and i almost froze- but didnt. He doesnt do it often, where i think its him every time. sorta like a fire drill",

I agree about the need to alert medical personnel- i carry a card in my wallet/purse that states \"no blood transfusions\", its an advanced directive and has other information in there too but who knows if the dr will even look in there before starting the treatment if its like a bad car accident!

I voted everyday with my email address and my dh's :)  I actually only know Anne from the stage4 boards, she had her opinions and didnt hesitate to share ;) funny cuz she'd rub me the wrong way in one post and then say just what i needed to hear in another... I do believe she explained her reasons for her decreased activity. It seems when we lost Apple quite a few of us stopped posting there- honestly i take each loss really bad knowing it may be me soon, so i dont often even read the posts. Follow the PTs directions to the T. Did they give you any at home exercises? After 6 mo i was back to normal and continued the at home exercises as needed. Well everything is good in our neck of the woods- dh had a promising job interview yesterday... we'll see :)",

Everyone knows at least one person with cancer, and many people discover undx cancer when they die of something else. Parabens- i dont use cosmetics, but i do use shampoos. I should look into which are paraben free. Cosmeticswise I know burts bees is, my sis uses their products- they have a face towelette that smells like grapefruit.",

I didnt know they still had those trampolines. Kids are doing great! Enjoying the routine of school and seeing friends. I volunteer 3 days a week unless they need me for more. I helped with picture day. It was like herding monkeys! Especially the pre-k classes. I am on the PTA so i am pretty involved with the school. Next yr i plan to apply to be a substitute and you need professional references and i know that i can get them from the school. Friday the liabrarian said she enjoys when i am in there helping out, 1 week when i had appts and couldnt make it into the school they offered to send someone else, she told me she said \"no i will wait for Mrs. B(me) to come in\". Its probably my OCD that makes me a great helper LOL j/k i am VERY effciant though.  Debbi- no sports this yr. Daughter traded dance for scouts. Boys werent interested in sports this year.

WHAT A RUSH! She loved it! I also was nominated (and will recieve) a makeover from a upscale salon, and an on ice honor thing at the \"pink in the rink\" event next saturday. So aweome. Iowa- i hope the recovery is going well Hey Lady, anything new with you? Wherria- so glad to hear from you, wish it was under better circumstances, but i am so happy you checked in! Keep us updated! Very interesting article. Its true that the 5 yr. mark can be misleading. Especially since not 100% of the deaths are cancer related, but they are counted in that total. Small update on me had scans last week- everything is stable, or smaller. 2 Brain mets had slight growth, but i recently had focal brain radiation so swelling isnt uncommon.  ",

Anyhow my husbands was one charge and it was 1 page. Mine were NUMEROUS things and 18 pages! BTW i know we talked about cost earlire ands its so funny because this shows that I paid close to 8,000 in copays and such whereas i thought it was more like 6 or so. Glad they kept bdetter records! Flu shot- my oncologist strongly suggested that i get one too- i am nervous sorta in a concpiracy theory way LOL the new shots have the H1N1 vaccine mixed in (like a combo shot)- well thats what i heard. When obama didnt let his girls get the shot i felt i shouldnt either- yes total wacko thinking LOL I guess i will discuss it with my dr again! Ginger- Okay i'll get a flu shot! Def dont want to die!!!! I want to hear the longer story! About the numbness, is this a SE that is long lasting after chemo? It doesnt do permanet damage does it? Whoop whoop to Wherria! Last chemo! I am so jealous!!!!!! Omaz- as to the cause of your  growth--- were you stressed at all? I see you you're in AZ we lived there in 07-09 and with the economic hit we took i KNOW i was stressed during that period! (also thats when i first felt the lump) But i agree with Lizzy- cancer WILL grow eventually and who really knows what set them into motion! Lisa- Sorry to hear of your night! Hey do you get a lot of skipping with Netflix? like the movie doesnt line up with the vocals? I am not sure if its my stupid computer or netflix and i dont know oneone else that gets Netflix! lago- How does the dr or whomever know when you got BC? 5.5 in 4 years is fast?!?!?! (i wonder what my 11cm in 1 year would be concidered LOL- if there was a cancer olympics i'd enter!!!) Calamity- I think you will have grounds to fight if they play the pre-existing card on you because you didnt ASK to be switched! BTW i read front toes instead of tires LOL and i was like does she mean her big toes LOL thats how far my mind is gone, i actually thought you might be having major toe issues because of chemo! About debt- the way i see things is that Debt will be there tomorrow (or whenever we come up with the money to pay) so dont stress it, it is one of the sure things in our lives (DEATH AND TAXES) i myself am in a pickle with the IRS (got a crummy letter) we borrowed some money and may have to pay them it all back at once instead of over time- we'll see LOL it isnt worth stressing about! Tis the season to feel thankful :) Iowa- SO happy to hear its probably fatty tissue!!! i bet thats one of the only times a gals happy to hear it IS fat! ;) Ann- sorry to hear bout the reaction- yeah if that area never sees the sun i can assume that it will burn easier. Keep us updated! We got a kitten- Well i was watchin a movie earlier and i kept hearing a mew sound so i muted the tv and opened my door. In runs this fuzz ball and its ribs were noticible and i felt bad. I opened a can of tuna and gave it to him. I picked him up and saw massive fleas so put him out. (i have get an allergic reaction to flea and misquito bites were they swell up and leave dark scars) ANyhow, a few hours later when my daughter and i got home from school he ran in my house again! SO we went to the store and spent an unsightly amount of money to keep him flea free, fed and littered LOL or and not bored, my 5 yr old picked almost every cat toy they had for this guy! LOL Well jokes on me i think the tuna gave him diarreah! Lucky he knows where his litter box is and all poops have been in it! Monday i am gonna call a vet and get him chekced out. So i guess we got a PET!!!!! Oh my daughter named him \"Smarty Marty Smarty pants\" i'll just call him smarty LOL BTW- the school gives the kids a whole week off for thanksgiving break so doubt i'll get a lot of time to get online. HAVE A HAPPY AND SAVE THANKSGIVING!!!!!! I AM THANKFUL TO HAVE FOUND BCO AND THE WONDERFUL MEMEBERS WHO SHARE THEIR STORIES IN MY TIME OF NEED! GOD BLESS YOU ALL!!!!",

Hopefully you avoid another surgery!!!! Iowa- same here!!! The wieght is just crazy! I weigh almost the same amount that i did pregnant, with no excuse!!!

Lizzy- Reading your story made me tear up, i think as Americans and North Americans we all feel connected someway to 9/11 but for those who actually lost someone i cant imagin the pain.... I wish we lived close i so would give ya a hug! I will never forget where i was when i heard about it- i was asleep (i lived on the west coast) and one of my husbands friends from back home called to see if my husband was okay- he was in the Army- and because he was stationed in WA (state) his friend thought we were by the pentagon... I didnt lose anyone close to me on that day, but i did lose friends that went over to fight... Really good guys ya know- i pray and thank God everyday that my husband didnt go (he got out before they sent anyone) there was a LAV roll over into a creek or something and the back door was padlocked and the top hatch was blocked cuz the vehical was upside down. Those guys didnt have a chance... SOmetimes i feel guilty that my husband was here, not that that would have changed anything but it sure makes you thankful for what you've got.... If it were up to my husband he'd re-up in a heartbeat he's so HOOAH, but i honestly would lose my mind if you was overseas.... Sorry just took a stroll down memory lane... Lymphademia- does it hurt? i am starting to get a little tenderness near my \"dog-ears\" and it dosnt feel like fluid build up or anything but who knows... I am so becoming a hyprocondriac- every little pain has me worried, still gettting bad headaches btw- gonna talk to my dr about that on thur....",

Some people swear that they have been accuarte while others say no... Debbi- thanks for asking, my dr called and left a message saying the scans looked good but when i called to clarify he was out of the office and he hasnt returned my call as of yet. I see him monday so i am not too worried about it... I think its the same as last time \"stable\" so i am not stressin, i think if there was progression he might have said something else LOL Yup healing well after surgery and rads- i am not usre whats next for me cept continue herceptin, zometa and tamox :) Lizzy- Yes i grew up in a smoking home until i was middle school aged my parents smoked indoors- then they got the message that second hand smoke is bad and they started smoking on the porch :) (btw my mother smoke while pregnant) We went to see kung fu panda 2 this weekend but i totally wanted to see bridesmids! it looks hilarious!!! I will wait to rent hangover 2 though cuz i know i'd like to watch it a few times... jsw- oh now i know what she's talking about, i just recently saw the comercial for that- when you first listen to it it sounds like a exercise program but turns out its a pill- maybe its call trim in 90 or something that or trim90x ... no clue but it had me confused LOL Good luck with your MUGA omaz- tech i've been getting only echos too, but when my nurse tells me she says \"oh you're due for your MUGA\" but when i get to the hospital they do an echocardiogram... not sure the differnece LOL About cosmetics- i know that they (by they i mean the talking heads on everything cancer lol) say that some things in cosmetics and other beauty related stuff \"may cause cancer\" or is \"linked\" to cancer. Which i call BS on- i NEVER use makeup, the only times i've used it is when my sister in law wants me to look nice for something and thats like once every 3 years LOL, i dont do lotions often, i just basically wash my hair and face LOL. Although i do enjoy aveeno body wash.... Sogo ahead and paint your nails Lizzy LOL i doubt it really caused our breast cancer!",

Lizzy- About leaving your bra- that is the most hilarious story ever! SO your friend bit the bullet and had a sleep over with this guy and still couldnt find the bra... Wonder what he did with it?!?!? Slim in 6 is part of the beach body company. They are the ones that put our p90x, insanity ect.... they also have a website that you can use. I have thought about it but know those dvds would just be collecting dust on my shelf LOL You're correct about me changing my major- I had breifly Pm'd you about it but hadnt had the chance to get to tell the group. I have time now LOL- kids are driving my crazy from their being off for what seems liked forever. As all of you know I have 2 young children whom I devote my time to, now they are in school I went back to school. I was doing pretty well with everything- 2 Bs and 2 As, although I would study my arse off and still only get a 70something on my tests. If it wasnt something i had basic knowledge of before cancer it just isnt sticking in my head LOL. ANd of course I would NEED to memorize some of these things in the nursing field.  Well that in addition to the nursing schedule at first (long hours sometimes 12 or 14 hr shifts) wouldnt go well with me and my parenting. I made a promise to myself that I am going to go bck to school and such only if it doesnt interfere with my children. So I prayed about it and it came to me that both my parents are deaf and I am fluent in American Sign Language. Its also a 2 yr degree so its not any extra time to compleat. And the shcedule is a lot better than the nursing program which was M-TH 8 am to 5 pm. My new schedule is only Monday (9-5) and Weds (9-12) so really gives me 2 days. The only drawback is I have to drive an hour each way more like 45 minutes to get to the school because the college near me doesnt offer that program. All the classes I took this last semester transfered over to my electives. Maybe in another life I could have been a nurse. (before this chemo brain) LOL  Re Piper- that is a very awesome thing she did. Most children around that age are all about what they are getting and def not about giving. I am happy you shared that with us! Lizzy- I know is easier said than done but try not to think about the results until you get them. And chnaces are its nothing. The stats are for liver cancer right, not metastatic breast cancer. On the stage 4 fourum there are quite a few women living with mets to their livers. I know the anxiety that comes with tests. (my scans are on the 11th) I figure whats done is done no need to worry about it right this second, go and enjoy your bike (if its not icy or snowy over there) or just juice up everything in your house! LOL I feel like crap after my immunizations- now i know why my kids always were cranky for the next few days- i think the nurse put it in my bone instead of muscle LOL Well i gotta go :( the kids have been baking in front of the tv just long enough for me to catch up and post!!!!",

Men can be jerks and self centered! Rachel- I t hink your Gov realised that its more of a hardship to them if all the sick people went broke and they had to pay welfare benifits to them instead of making it easier and giving medical coverage. That party sounds fantastic! Let us know what gift you end up with!!! Lizzy- I have watched that show (always sunny) pretty funny in an adult crude humor way. About love- i agree with you that others arent luckier in love than others, but they work harder at accepting the other's short commings. I am being dead honest with you ladies- if i wasnt dx with stage 4 i would have divorced my husband the second he dropped this huge bombshell on me. I may have mentioned it somewhere on the boards, but i dont want it to stay forever in cyber space LOL (if ya want details i will gladly PM them to ya) Anyhow, it took a lot on my part to even look at him again. Turning to my faith I have been able to overcome it, but hey those are the chips i was dealt. Well my darling son is letting me know he wants to watch a movie on my computer LOL- got house work to do anyhow! Later!",

Which is refreshing in a society that mostly looks the other way. So you were ON the SJR show???? Interesting- they should make a movie about you and your exploits- or at least a book ;) I despise the choke chains, and people that tie their dogs up 24/7- which my SIL does they claim their dog is \"untrainable\" we went over during the holidays and I took the dog off her tie out, and had her on a leash by my side the WHOLE day- at first she would try to jump up on me, but i would show dominance over her (holding her down til she subitted) she only tried jumping on me for a few times before she realsied that i meant business. Anyhow they never let their dog run free- what is the point of having an animal if you're gonna lock it up or beat it. We actually had a pit bull/german sheapard mix and everyone told me what horrible dogs pit bulls were ect... No they aren't horrible dogs- the horrible owners that mistreat the \"vicious breed\" dogs they get are the problem. Interesting fact- Chihuahuas are more likely to bite than a vicious breed dog. My mom had one and it actually bit my daughter in the face for no reason. Reason that rotties, german sheapards and pit bulls get a bad rap is that a large % of the owners buy those dogs for the intention of using them for home protection and they train them to be aggressive. Then breed specific laws come about and idiots without half a brain say \"oh i want that type of dog do dog fight ect....\" bad cycle I am glad to hear your friend still has that dog. I would have hunted that owner down and made sure he never owned a dog again :)",

People with stage 4 (ME) they keep it in indefinatly.... Just because its more of a matter of when not if on needing it again! Def ask your oncologist i am with ya on getting it out ASAP! lizzy- Do you work for walmart???? or target???? lol dont leave me hangin! HAPPY BIRTHDAY JSW19- heres too many more!!!! Sorry to hear about your cat and hubby's grandfather. That has to be a hard decision, damn this cancer! Onemonga- that sounded awesome!

I am not sure about the recon part of your question, but i am glad you got to spend some positive time with some fellow BC warriors! Carolyn- herceptin does give me diareha too- its weird cuz with the compazine the first few days i am constipated then when i stop taking it its goes to antoher extreme, my oncologist suggested immodium too although i never take it because i am just DONE with all these freakin drugs! it lasts maybe 2 or 3 days after it starts then i am fine- and the twithces, also get those LOL the only one that bothers me is in my eye like a crazy twitch lol the others just come and go i am pretty good at ignoring them! is taxol the same as taxotere? or is that different? I will say the worse of the SE have lessened for me after the 2nd treatment- one it me hard, 2 harder, 3 not as bad but super nauseous (but you remember the stress i had with my crazy sister in law) and i am 5 days out from my 4th TX and mostly normal lol Also i dont trust my 5 yr old on the bus because the high schoolers ride the same bus... i totally dont mind walking, i am gaining too much weight lol roughly 20 pounds, its those damned boost shakes LOL my oncologist said exercise would be good (i think he was hinting that i am gaining too much LOL) LadyinBama- AGAIN! well hopefully you are in and out this time! New with me- my nails feel wierd- i heard they could fall off but they feel tingly and the \"moons\" look sorta rainbowed- lol well just pink and red stacked like i can see each tx in my nails lol i def am gonna ask my dr about this on the 28th when i have my next appointment!",

Right now the tumors arent effecting her eating and such. Just remember what its like for us on chemo- i'd imagine it'd be the smae for her, but she wouldnt understand WHY it was happening. Like you said she's lived a very long life for a cat- i hate to suggest euthinizing her when her tumor does effect her QOL but i couldnt imagine putting a cat through chemo... just my thoughts (my friends down syndromed sister had to do chemo for lykemia and it was hard because she wasnt capable of grasping the whole why shes sick thing, all she did understand is she was sick) Lizzy- yeah in hindsight i should have know something was wrong- not that i was SICK per se but WEAK, i couldnt even lift a gallon of milk (or my kids) without a shooting pain in my ribs- i went to a chiro but it made it worse (bones were weakened cuz of cancer) so yeah if only i would have know then... But dont forget i was stage iv at presentation so it got out of control in my body, i bet when i was stage 1 and 2 it wasnt effecting me at all (but who knows how fast they grew and spread) Good luck all who go in for TX tomorrow!",

Calamity- I figured it out over the weekend (as to my messy house) , its not that i cant clean up anymore- its just i dont clean up as FAST as i once did and the kids are faster than me at making messes! Why dont you declare a \"SCHOOL HOLIDAY\" have someone take care of the kids, or come over to supervise them while you work on getting your orders together???? LadyinBama- I would ask for the script to be on the safe side, my first few tx were worse painwise than these last few, but who knows if it was the taxotere or the nuelasta shot. If oyu dont need to use the pain meds GREAT but its nice to have them just in case! Onemonga- Funny cuz you see the end in sight and they strech it out! But hopefully your liver will do well! Yeah everyone is wanting us to visit in the summer and i agree- making long term plans isnt the best idea until we get over this hump of our tx and then we can evaluate where we are... Whoop whoop on the no roid or nupegen! Everyone is entitled to feel blue :) I got ahold of my dr (dont remember if i mentioned this but i totally left my appointment last week with being told we need to check into my hip but not clarifiying and setting up an appointment! lol totally chemo brained lol) and i have xrays of my hip tomorrow, just to be safe they want to make sure this pain ISNT the cancer in my femur growing... Which is making me a little nervous cuz lets be real it very well may be the cancer! But i am not letting it dwell in my mind cuz what good is that!  Chemo is thursday so i am once again getting everything ready for the week after chemo (making frozen meals, getting my house as clean as it will ever be, packing for my mini vacation away from the family- hey i will take what i can get! 2 days are better than no days!) HERES TO ALL OF OUR TREATMENTS WRAPPING UP SOMETIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE! MAY WE ALL HAVE SE FREE DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I cant wait for this bone scan- if it turns out clear the dr said we will look at a pain med script.... Emotionally- i feel sorta abandoned by my friends... At first people were quick to call, text or email me about how i was doing. (not tons of people but some really close friends) I havent heard from a lot of my friends for at least 2 TX cycles now which is like 6 weeks!

Did a little shopping but mostly stayed low key BBQing and hanging out! It was awesome. So so my dr on Monday an they got the results of the bone scan, no cancer in the left hip so prob just reg joint pain. Said keep taking OTC meds for it unless serious i have viccodin. Thats good news, but the not so goood is that the scans still showed the right side with cancer and the rib sternum area as well. (it was just a bone scan so not sure about the lungs) Well he seemed to be leaning towards stopping at 6tx so we get to the rads quicker. But he said we'll know for sure AFTER the 6th tx, which is monday the 29th.",

Although my chemoangel sent me some aveneo anti-stress body wash which i used the other day when i took a long soak and after i got out of the tub i thought i'd just lie down a sec before getting dressed and i woke up a few hours later! I felt AMAZING! So maybe its stress LOL Zachsmom- Glad the surgery went well. Tumor markers, no my dr doesnt do them. Libraylil- OOOH sounds fun, great deal on a steamer.  we didnt do xmas til yesterday with the inlaws so we bought all their presents (or most of them cuz i did buy a few before) til yesterday. Walmart had a lot of stuff on sale! i bought my brother in law a massager that goes on a chair for only 24 bucks! (i wanna go back and get one for myself today lol) we woke up to frost on our cars and my 5 year old was excited cuz she thought it was snow!  Ginger- when did your nuropathy first pop up? appy to hear you had a good holiday with the fam!  Aw Lizzy i feel so bad that you had to go through that! What a pain in the neck! (btw infections can be tricky for drs- or maybe theyre dumb-  i took my son in when he was a little over a yr old cuz i swore he had an ear infection, dr checked him and and said no he's fine- we went home next day he was acting the same and mothers intuition i KNEW it was an ear infection- took him back in and they say the ear was BRIGHT red and looking really infected. i complained cuz we didnt have health coverage and i was paying out of pocket for these visits and the 2nd dr said sometimes the infection doesnt show til a while after you have it. Anyhow so maybe although you had the infection signs werent visible for your dr) Do you have an appointment with your dr today? ",

Anyhow i got a call a few hours ago that my sister is in the hospital because he beat her severly (huge black eye and multiple bruises on her body) He also cut her behind both knees TO THE BONE luckily he just knicked one of the tendons not through it. ANd deeply cut her arm. She is in the hospital and he in jail- BUT OF COURSE SHE DOESNT WANT TO PRESS CHARGES :( They want to release her today, but none of my family want her at their houses for various reasons (no space or they dont want her detoxing in front of their young children) I am going crazy here!!!!! Of course i cant call anyone (my new phones come in tomorrow) so i am in the dark. Update: she was released and wants to call him in jail to \"tell him that she's okay and she loves him\" WTF- i know its hard being in the cycle of abuse, but beng on the outside looking in i wish there was somethin i could say or do to make her OPEN her eyes! Okay just had to get all that off my chest cuz i am going stir crazy here",

Surgeon appointment yesterday-  SO the surgeon said that based on the size of the 1 tumor that disappeared (11cm) he recommends a mx because even though its not showing up, there cold be a few live cancer cells that made it through chemo but are too small to pick up. Also in order to get clear margins he needs to remove some of my pectoral muscle cuz the tumor that is still there is attached to it. He also recommends zapping the area where the pectoral is removed with rads. Then recon. I told him i am not interested in the recon but i'd rather do a bi lat mx even though i have a smaller chance of getting BC in the other side. He said that he agrees and I can have them both removed. Its scheduled for the 31st of this month. I have family flying in from out of town to be here for 2 weeks- is that an appropriate amount of time after the mx? How'd y'all fare- anyone have muscle removed? I wonder how that affects healing time....",

Its like we are trading one malady for another! Mineral oil works for my kids. 1 tbs and within a few hrs they have cleared up their constipation. Like an internal lubercant. Although the side effect is that they usually have really runny poos for the whole day. Beats the pain of constipation though.

We're doing some serious penny pinchin right now to get there. I say we just drive, but DH cant take that many days off. Plus my niece's theater group is trying to make it to internationals which takes place in NE, gotta do some fund raising for that.

Lizzy-SO true, it is a chemical battle we've under gone much like a nuclear bomb there is bound to be fall out! (even with just the diagnostic scans we'er overly exposed- they dont call it nuclear medicine for nothing!) debbi- i would have never in a million years ever thought i'd say this to another person in my life but, Whoohoo for your new nipples. Seriously the close we can get to \"normal\" as we can the better off our mentality will be! All- I am doing really good! We had a scare with our eldest, she was in the hospital but out now. Whewwwww i was keeping some late hours being up worried sick about her! But i was over joyed when she came home! See my dr on the 4th, other than that all is good in my neck of the woods :)",

When i joined this board i made a hard decisio to NOT be preachy here because afterall we know thatsnot what we come on to BCO for- although i have shared it with ppl in PMs ormay e publicly. So yes i am always looking towards the future! And i plan to keep it that way, i may say the occational prayer line or something but i am not here to push my beliefs :) Agree with the hershyes i like dark but prefer milk chocolate! Sweeny- we dont mind one bit! Seldom is  better than never :) thanks for prayer!did you say NEGATIVE 39!?! Count me out! We are at maybe 50 and i cant feel my toes, at your temps i figure my toes would have fallen off! Rachel- thats nice you took here there, i have lived in san antonio are for a lont time (off and on since02) but never been on the tower of americas (our claim to fame tower) i was told but maybe wrong that they dont do the some patients get meds and others dont in cancer studies, but they compare it to the current standard care that is offered.... maybe thats only in the states??????",

Lizzy- thsnks for the clarification, i donht think it was needed, lol ( are you sure you worked on wallstreet and NOT a big wig law firm!) J/k but just in case someone was confused its always good to clarify! LIZZY You speak the truth!!!!!! (Please stop reading this post if you are easily upset) This is exactly how explained it to my 8, 8 and 6 year olds, so i hope y'all dont get offended :) H G G G g G G g G G Gg G G Lizzy Okay you speak the truth! We ALL 100% of human kind have cancer cells in our bodies! As soon as we begin forming in utero our cells (may be onlly and handful in one person but a zillion in another- like our bodies are making photocopies of the first cell that split after so many thoudand photocopies the pages get blurred and we have a hard time reading the lines- our cells get blurred and have a hard time reading their instructions) sometimes they form a mutation (okay i have to laugh here cuz this totally is the spot where my 6 year old was asking me if it was like teenagde mutant ninja turtles LMBO] where the natrual cell cycle is disrupted, (those cells dont have the programmed cell death step, so thus we have UNCONTROLLED cell growth)- very similar to how a wart keeps telling that same spot to keep growing skin before the old skin falls off, but cancer growth is much more dangerous because it takes over the healthy tissuse like mommys lungs did when i couldnt breath! but the weird thing is not everyone's mutated cancer cells \"turn on\" some lie dormant until much later in life, or NEVER. The main reason why my particual cancer was swept under the rug, i was told \"you're too young\" no crap i am too young! But something turned my cells on wether it be what i ate as a child, exposure to pollution, chemicals- the list is ENDLESS! So anyhow, my train of thought is why fight an uphill battle!?! I cannot change the fact i have cancer, justvas my sister who is pregnant cant change thd fact thst her growing bsby is developing mutated cells this very second! Now what we can change is our over exposing ourselves to things have have PROOVEN to increeasecthat risk of turning on these cells. Also i went on to say- have i been a sick mommy, or have i been a go outside and play mommy. ( i bet yall know this answer) oh and another freaking hilarious moment was when iexplained the radiation to my brain my 6 year old (he has some brains let me tell you!) asked if i would be radioactive like spiderman so i csn climb the walls!!!! Um yeah that would be cool but the most i may get is a headache! There is no cure- we cannot cure something unless we KNOW the cause! We are still working the stupid cause people! But we can keep living our life to the full and use our jedi mind force to be happy in the here and now. (Bear with me lol they afterall are in elemantry school!) This is honest to God how i explained it to them! We are honest and open home, i believe if a child is old enough to ask the question  then they deserve an age approritate answer! If you do NOT satisfy their curiosity THEY WILL ask other people. (I am not lying when i say i learned of sexual \"favors\" when i was 6! My 11 yr old sister was hanging with her friends and they of course were talking about boys and stuff and of course me being nosy - i asked whats tht mean- um yeah i was disgusted and not quite getting it lol, but i can still picture us all standing around outside lmbo! They prob didnt fully understand themselves but it didnt stop them from sharing with me!)  My kids were 2 and 4 when i was dx'd imagine the shock when were are at the pool and another child noticed my port and my son at 3 explains that my boobies were sick and the dr had to cut them off! This little girl is asking all these questions and i just let him explain it to her. Then she says \"wanna swim to the line\" off they go! Oh an that another thing that chaps my butt! So we totally are they type to surround us with thd positive ppl that arent tearing up everytime i walk into the room. Of course a friend posted on facebook \"my best friends cancerccame back why does bad happen to good\" i get it, she wanted to release her emotions, but when youre mutual friends with my crazy in-laws please speak in code lol! So these \"loving, caring\" in-law thst knew i spent a week in the hospital ( oh this is rich- so my sister in law calls and asks if i need anything i say actually a hair brush cuz they gave me this flimsy comb anf my hair post chemo is unruly! This is like 10am mind you, hospital or not i cant get rats in my hair lol and i tell her \"go to the dollarstore i have a dollar in my bag i will pay you back etc.\" She texts throught the day saying she is on her way, then delayed, then on her way... she got to my room after 6pm and brought me a comb from her house! She sat there the entire time telling me she had somewhere to be, she left after no more than 30 minutes!- and shocker you wonder why i am not jumping at the chance to tell you i havr cancer in my freakin brain! From day one i told the whole family- stage4, nocure, life freakin long treatments! They dont care enough to ask me how i feelvEVER! If i told them right this very instsnt thry would turn it around on them and throw themselves a pity party!) Okay back to the chapped butt- so fscebook \"forced\" me to share, well only with the one person- and i tell her the whole \"we dont want/need all this sad crap PLEASE!\" Oh and i got honest witgh her for the first timr sincr my \"fundraiser\" where the cops were called to my oncologists! Oh yeah this was a long time coming- this inlaw is the LEAST offensive, most helpful wonderful person-truly she is my only \"friend\" in my husbands family, but to protect myself anf my husband/kids when i chose not to be forthcoming with my health she also wasnt ever told! I told her how many times and where its come bsck, i told her about the lung biopsy that resulted in a punctured lung anf how my husband anf kids had to get a hotel room in a town thst he has 6 brother/sisters and PARENTS that live and have room enough to accomodate them! I told her how many different chemos i havecbeenon that didnt work- it ALL came out! Well i assure her if she can maintain- key word here MAINTAIN! A positive, encourging attitude i will continue to keep her in the loop perse, but my ONLY term is she cannot voulnteer this information to the family, i did instruct her not to lie, but dont voulnteer- if they ask about me, say  i am well, you know! So last night we made plans to go to her hous and pop fireworks because i was in the hospital for newyears and my kids missed out, so my brothet in law and his wife and grandson were there. He kept hugging me lol i am not an idiot as they often like to think ( i am just an excellent card player, i observe everything they say and do, hold my cards close- i was raised street! I learned this at a young age to survive!) So anyow i am thinking- it takes me 3 freakin years to trust you and in 3 days you have severed that trust, with NO NO NO chance of ever regaining it! So i am being manhandled, we got there at 6pm and left shortly after 8! That was plenty for me! My husband who is extremly patient was ready to leave within 30 minutes but we had to wait for the sun to go down for those fireworks!!!!!!! THE ABSOLUTE ICING ON THE CAKE IS HOW MY DAUGHTER HANDLED IT (they are sharp, they saw the sad faces, and hugging!) She said \"its okay mom thy havent learned to trust in God- we know the truth.) My beautiful 8yr old daughter has more freaking sense than these ADULTS! I told her we just live by example :) Whew! I can believe i shared all that- i feel like cheech, but without the fun part of smoking the dope! Dana- yup no matter what, the prospect of scan, tests, bloodwork gets uscin knots! Keep us posted! Even i hold my breath while waiting for cmy results!!!!!!! Debbi- YUP! This sure will fly by! Love the ideas! Funny cuz a \"rule\" in my house is no tv on school nights, thst goes for internet, video games etc.... sunday after \"church\" it begins ourweek, so up until friday afterschool they are (in their minds) depraved! So imagin their surprise when i think day 2 i was spinning like crazy and told them turn on the tv! They looked at me like i was an alien! My 8 yr old boy kept reminding me it was a school night lol, i told him \"free pass dude! Unless you wanna rake the leaves!\"  Background on me cuz i am in a shsring mood! I am the ONLY one in my entire family to graduate high school, neither parents, siblings, aunts and cousins! Just me! I left home 16- wellmy mom tried to get me to marry this guy i was datin at 15! Love wasnt givrn in my home, we were working since ppl would pay me (10 or 11 babysitting) i got my first paper route at 12! I would get up at 3/4 am and strap on this heavy bag full of papers, walk (yes walk cuz i didnt have a bike yet) and mind you when i got married at 18 i wieghed under 100 pounds \"my wedding dress\" was an easter dress from th kids department in mervyns! So i was this little wisp of a girl BUT ifvyou want to eat you gotta work! (Please dont read this and feel sad- i have come to appreciate these lessons thst iwas given) oh and a note- i didnt graduate highshool the normal way lol grduated early! I knew if i didnt lesvecthat situation i would have died! Literally i wa getting caught up with evrything (drugs/crime/sex) anyhow.... so this paper route was funny cuz a boy in my apartments parents saw me getting up and doing it, so they had their 2 boys get one, when it was raining or snowing (which i lived in Washington state- so that WAS often) i could hear their mom telling them to get up and do thei route- look the neighbor girl is doing her route, blahblahblsh LOL they HATED me! I have to clarify- love was given to me by my step dad, we had a unique relationship, i truly miss him, unfourtntly my mother tried to drive a wedge between us, we had thisk thing- lol when my parents would fight my mom would bring my sisters and me to referee who was \"right\" weof course learned to say it was myvmom who 99% of the time wasntvlol. As soon as we had a moment i would tell him i knowche is right but i didnt want to get itno trouble. He knewcand understood- honedtly he only stayed with my mom to protect us. He NEVER raisec a hand to us in anyway! So yes i was shown love! Dang myy husbandcwoke up! He doesnt want me strainig my eye lol MORE LATER",

The homeless problem is pretty big in Phoenix and when we were living htere they actually had a school especially for homeless kids which was nice because they focused on issues that normal schools dont like hygiene (allowing them to brush teeth and shower, wash clothes) Better nutrition (know that sometimes the only food they ate was at school) Sadly for budget reasons they were closing htat school down. It is a dis-service to our nation to let these children fall through the cracks. They have no control over their circumstances and yet they are paying for it by sub-par education if any and very dim futures. ALL CHILDREN NEED AN EDUCATION IF THEY WANT TO DO ANYTHING IN LIFE. a sad vicious cycle....",

We'll see :) my appointment is for the 19th Funny story about either my bitchiness or bad assness LOL- Once (b4 my dx, but when i was in pain cuz of hte mets) I went to the grocery store- i loathe walmart and make a point NOT to shop there- so i am at my reg grocery store and i am making a salad and i bought like every veggie imaginable so i had 13 items in the 10 items or less line (which is located in the produce section). I have my son who is 2 at the time, there is a guy in front of me prob in his 70s that has about 20 or so items and the cashier rudely told him he had too many items, i was the only person in line and say \"no worries, you're only a few over go ahead\" The cashier looked pissed (btw she was in her 40s so not a young highschooler with an attitude but a grown woman) she rings him up and then states \"he had (enter number) items too many\" well by the time it was my turn there was another couple behind me, i already had all my stuff loaded on the counter and she was like \"miss you have too many items, you need to go to the other registers (which are located on the other side of the store!)\" i told her \"i only have 3 extra things thats fine\" she was still acting bitchy and telling me to move- i said \"never mind i dont need these anymore\" and left ALL my groceries at the counter and walk out!- so then it stalled her line even longer as she prob had to call for a stalker to put them away. I am fuming mad cuz the ONLY other place for me to shop is walmart- i 411ed the grocery store's number while i was driving over there and spoke with a manager and i said \"first off i apologize for just up and leaving my groceries at the counter because normally i would have put them back, second i would like to make a complaint against one of your employees. SHe was very rude to an elderly gentleman\" (i explained that i was hte ONLY one in line behind him and i didnt mind him checking out there) then i explained how she was trying to make me move to another register, that ALL my purchases were from the produce section and i was at the produce register. I stated \"i was unaware that your 10 item or less policy was a steadfast rule, and have NEVER before seen someone with a couple items over asked to move, i often am buying 1 item and end up waiting behind someone with a carload of groceries\" then i went on to say how upset iwas that i had to drive 15 minutes out of my way and how i was fuming to shop at walmart cuz a- they suck and b- their produce always goes bad within a few days- not good quality! He apologized profusely.... Yeah re-reading that i sound more bitchy than bad-ass lol I just have a rule in my mind, people like store clerks, drs, and other ppl you run into on a daily basis work for US. If they want to keep their jobs do them right. I hate going through a drive thru, ordering something simple and getting it all ass-backwards! We went to Mcdonalds a while back and my DH ordered a strawberry shake- it was really melted, so i parked and went into the store and said hey y'all made this shake wrong may i get another one. of course they gave me another one and it was still melted! she then said oh our machine is broken. would i like a refund- um YEAH i dont want a liquid shake! If you noticed it coming out liquid both times you could have just told us that it was broken and we wouldnt have went elsewhere... I cant stand going into a business and being delt with by rude, incompetent ppl that act like we are bothering them. If i am asking where a product is please dont tell me \"over there\" and point in a general direction! Chances are i have scoured that area and couldnt find it myself. i need assistance lol (btw thats the main reason i dislike WM and shop there only when absolutely needed!)",

I resisted temptation of squeezing it cuz it looked like the start of a white head, but i thought 5 yr old no way its a white head it must be something like skin cancer! My husband said i was being paranoid, which i prob was LOL i thought each and every mole or blemish on my kids and husband needed to be checked out right away LOL... okay so anyhow it was there on her nose for maybe 3 months before i gave it a little squeeze and a little white junk came out.... i thought that'd be the end of it but no it stayed there for another 2 months! i was nervous, her teacher even asked what it could be and then maybe last week it FINALLY turned into a white head and now its gone! Who in the heck has heard of a zit taking 5 months to come and go!!!!!  Oh and i have TOTALLY done that to my sister! We were in highschool and there was this cute waiter at this MX resturant that she thought was cute, i told her \"te quiero en mi cama\" meant whats your name! (that translates i want you in my bed!) I almost died laughing! And she was like \"what did you make me say\" i told her and she was ticked LOL but needless to say he did a really good job at filling our drinks and stuf!!! We do speak spanish at home, mostly in English though. About 30-40% in spanish. I've gotten mixed opinions if us speaking dual languages might be part of the reason my son has a speech problems (hes 3) SOme say yes and some say no.... MY HEADACHE! i think i got it figured out- whenever i read small print like whats in my books i read it seems to lead up to headaches- i actually still have the one from yesterday and nothing i've taken has helped. i have always had 20/20 vision but i am gonna see an eye dr tomorrow before i see my oncologist- i actually had to postpone that appointment cuz of gas!

OMG! yes i notice that there are some doctors and their staff that treat you like crap when you have govt insurance. When my husband lost his job we got the kids insurance through the state but we didnt have to switch our pedi, before the staff was very nice, would chit chat ect (maybe cuz i was handing them a 20 dollar bill for our co-pay) after they got the state insurnace they were straight up RUDE! like we are less of people cuz we needed some help.... Kel- what an a hole! that dr obviously is in the practice for the money and not helping people or he would not have expected y'all to wait 2 months!!!! when my son got pnumonia and was hospitalized we had no insurance and couldnt afford some of the medication, one of the nurses gave me money to pay for it and also the medi supply store gave us a nebulizer. I mean total kindness! Seems rare but it is still out there! Hey zenith!!!! Great to hear from ya! Kel- my husband gets free insurance he doesnt have to pay into them and also free life insurance, on the other hand it costs just for me $400 a month (thanks God i signed up for health insurance but kicking myself i didnt opt for life insurance) My kids are on a low income health coverage, i dont have to pay monthly but i do pay co-pays... The family coverage was over $900 a month which sadly is more than my husband makes in 2 weeks so more than half his income would have gone to health insurance so that why i only insured myself... I have a $2000 out of network deductable and a $1000 in network one, and as y'all know its easy for me to meet my deductiable really early in the year which is nice! Hey sweeny nice hearing fom you too! Lizzy agree- people move to areas like yours cuz its close to nature ect.. but then when nature gets too close they wanna kill it! Tell them to move to the innercity LOL i will bet they will never see a groundhog there. We have these things called javelinas which are like wild boar and the other week we saw a family of about 20 or so, of course everyone was like lets shoot them, but they arent bothering us, havent gotten 1 chicken so they are to me not a pest. Pests we shoot, wildlife we dont..... Sweeny surprisinly no bug problems here thus far- usually we are swamped with mosquitoes but i dont think i have seen one this summer! Prob cuz its been so dry here! Oh yeah lizzy- my husband had a week off so we went up north to visit his family and go camping, camping never happened LOL i really didnt have time to get online, we got in yesterday and DH is at work right now and kiddos watching tv LOL i was having BCO withdrawls!",

Comming from a stage 4 perspective there are a lot of up and comming treatments out there that they deny to stage 4 women who are on their last leg and want to give it one last ditch effort. But the FDA says no. Either they need to test it further and the trials arent open to them or, the risks outweighs the \"benefits\" but when you're dying there is NO benefit to not geting something that may extend your life a while, or give you a better quality of life before you go....

Different chemos affect us differently. Yeah to good bloodwork! Omaz- i was just thinking about her too- i was wondering if her hair grew in.... I guess a lot of the members are done with their active treatments and dont come onto the boards :( Lizzy- thats awesome to hear! No plans for the 4th, my bro wants to come down to the coast but my husband has from the 3rd-9th off because its my daughters bday on the 7th so we want to GET OUT OF HERE! i am thinking after the crowds from the 4th go home we'll go camping....  Yummy about the cantalope honestly i could eat a whole one and have LOL but i think next time i buy one i will cut it up and freeze for the kiddos! Casey trial- OMG yes i watch it when i can and usually watch the highlights @ night... Agree she seems like a sociopath and i have no doubt in my mind that she did it. (cuz who else would have or could have) I think it is interesting that the jury is out of the loop on so much (like the fact her friend actually planned on adopting her baby til casey's mom said no to it) Or the fact that her and a friend used to bury their animals after putting heart shaped stickers on them (caylee was found with a heart shaped residue on her face) these things would leave no doubt in MY mind and thats before i take in consideration her lying about the nanny that was supposed to have been watching caylee while she was working at a job she hadnt had! For someone to make this stuff up you have to be culpable and i hate the fact they say it wasnt premeditated- she googled chloroform and various things like how to make it ect 80+ times months before caylee &quot;went missing&quot;. Then they through this whle her dad molested her and hte way her lawyer was talking about her learning to lie from that was inflammatory! (he actually said \"at age 8 she would have her dad's d*** in her mouth and then go to school\" thats how she got to be a good liar)You just cant make stuff up on your opening statement and then not back it up with HARD EVIDENCE! The kicker in that is there is a video taped visit with her and her dad and she is saying that he was the best dad and grandfather etc... If the allegations of child molestation were true i find it hard to believe she would have said that. Oh yeah and if someone molested you as a child why in the hell would you trust them to care for your DAUGHTER when ever you needed a sitter????? Does not add up to me Do i think she will be found guilty???? Prob not, the prosecution hasnt proved their cause beyond a reasonable doubt. If by some slim chance she is found guilty she can appeal on numerous grounds (like the incompetence of her attorney for one) Kel- Yeah i think that is the safest thing just stick to the few threads you know arent going to keep opening up your healing wounds from cancer...OOOOh so maybe the coffe gave you the cysts (fingers crosed)",

There was just not enough time to do everything i wanted to do! I enjoyed my vacation aqnd actually am getting onoine to see if i can find my husband a job up there LOL i miss home so much! Okay now for my drama- on our flight back we had to get up at 2:30 am to make it to the airport, my kids fell asleep on the first flight but were wide awake on the second flight. they of course being 6 and 3 made some noise but they werent running up and down the isles or anything like that. well this older man that prob didnt have kids or grandkids got up to use the restroom and when he passed them he told them \"you guys need to be quiet!\" that sorta ticked me off seeing how he didnt bring it up with me or a flight attendant but i let it drop.... As we were getting off the plane and getting in line to get our baggage that they chekced @ the gate he said to me \" your kids were really bad on this flight\" i could feel my blood boiling so i said \"actually i think my kids did quite well seeing how we had to get up at 2 am and we've been travling for almost ten hours now, they're tired and cranky but not to the point where i'd say they were being bad kids\" He said \"i saw YOU were able to get some rest on the plane\" in a very nasty tone to me and i said \"yeah i did get some sleep- i am recieving treatment for my cancer and it makes me sleepy, if you had a problem with my kids (btw my voice is raising by this point) you should have done something like talk with a flight attendant. Then this dickhead in front of him said \"its not our job to parent your kids\" i told him to \"shut the f*** up and mind your own damn business.\" Both the men were sitting there arguing with me and i said \"its none of y'alls f*ing business, so what if i took a f*ing nap, so shut the f* up\" SO y'all cant tell how mad i was at this point.... The guy's response to me was \"i am gonna have you arrested\" LMAO arrested for what? Oh and the dhead's wife said absolutly nothing as he is yelling at me, both these guys were prob almost 6 ft tall- i am all of 5\"2 carrying 2 kids and 3 suitcases. I wanted to tell her to keep her husband in check before i beat his face in, but i was being the bigger person, grabbed my stuff and walked away.... Then no one was there to pick me up LOL, i had to wait for over an hour because everyone forgot that we were coming in today. (my husband was away at a SWAT school- so my sil was supposed to get me i had left my car @ her house) SO that was icing on the cake! Well i gotta make my son lucnh and eventually catch up on the reading!",

Its sorta like how many people go get a biopsy done and its benign? something like 80% does that make biopsies over used as well????? No because it DOES help those who do have cancer. But then the scans can be dangerous to the person getting them if they get over exposed to all that junk... speaking of which i have a c/t tomorrow LOL My first week was good (no classes friday) son was sick today so he has to stay home tomorrow so i had to postpone my date :(",

It is the replacement of normal oxygen respiration of the body's cells by an anaerobic [i.e., oxygen-deficient] cell respiration.\" -Dr. Otto Warburg they concluded that \"The reason Food Therapies for cancer even exist today (beyond the fact that they work) is because someone once saw the connection between sugar and cancer. There are many food therapies, but not a single one allows many foods high in carbohydrates and not a single one allows sugars, BECAUSE SUGAR FEEDS CANCER. LOL i dont even know where to start in dissecting this article- first ALL cell respiration requires sugar- its starts with sugar- or glucose- when there is oxygen present it is able to go through its normal cycle and break down into 36-38 ATPs as a final product which is where we get our energy... in the case where there isnt enough oxygen, like when we are doing some heavy exercising, instead of being able to complete its cycle it stops after glycolosis and turns into fermentation- in humans when that happens we make lactic acid- for those who work out you know that burning feeling of lactic acid in your muscles.... When the article stated that; \"Another thing this tells us is that cancer metabolizes through a process of fermentation.\" if that was true more people that exercised would be susceptible to cancer- which is opposite of current research. i dont think the writer of this article realised that a lot of those food therapy diets use whole food plant based diets- plants break down into sugars- plants are carbs, granted they are complex carbs so our bodies take longer at absorbing those sugars than say a candy bar which is simple carbs.... If we wanted a diet compleatly free of sugars we'd just eat water LOL- even protein contains some sugars... My conclusion on this article is they are blaming sugars for causing cancer to metabolise- meaning the culprit from our diets are sugars, really the culprit from our diets is PROCESSED food and all the additives in our diets... These are unnatural and our bodies weren't designed to eat these things... Oh btw i love how there is no author stated- i am always wary when no one is willing to claim the work :) Anyhow- thanks for the articles :) Did i make any sense LOL? i have been studying and doing my speech assignments today",

I will try to take a pic and post I did take those people to small claims thats where i was awarded that judgement, what i was told is there is no limitations- i even went to a lawyer that sent them a demand for payment letter, of course they didnt pay. we have other options which ALL will cost me money to pursue and NONE will guarantee payment. Like one option is a writ of exicution which cost almost $300 and a constable goes over to their home and asks them for the money. If they don't pay there is nothing that happens to them and I am out my money- the justice system really sucks! How does it show up on their credit? Do i have to call the credit reporting agencies and let them know???? I am fixin to walk up to her house and knock on her door everyday til she pays me. Its not harrassment when i am just trying to enforce a payment... Is this the 60 mile walk? Because i was told No kids (thats komens 3 day in phoenix)",

Lady- Hope that bug has run its course- nothing worse than feeling sick! Kel- Whoop whoop on the clear mammo!!!! If done right they should hurt, some of these techs just get too grabby!!!! Carolyn that sucks- yeah its terrbile they wait a yr to let ya know and of course some places are quick to pass it to collections, billing needs more regulation Oh speaking of which i found out the reason i owe my oncologist so much is for the first 4 months i was seeing him they were being billed as out of network while they were really in network so the insurance is going to resubitt, fingers crossed! But funny it took 18 months for someone to figure that out, and by somebody i mean me! I was going through my charges and they said i owed X amount for an office visit, which i was like i paid my co-pay i shouldnt have to pay anything over that! well if my calculations are correct i owe them under $100 bucks! Lets see how this pan out- check back in 10-14 days LOL Kel- Whoo hoo on the clear nodes! Yes that is the first thing we worry about! About you're 2 things that have been paid- i would dispute it which costs you nothing. Let them know that both had been paid before being sent to collections. Its a lot easier getting stuff taken off now than before- if i am not mistaken you can do that online... Yeah crazy how the amount doesnt matter one bit, i personally dont think medical bills should effect our credit score (that'd be a perfect world lol) Lizzy- i am the same way- i had a crad to a very popular clothing store that had GREAT clearnace- which they would give you an extra % off when using your card, i would buy a ton of stuff for really cheap, go home and pay off the balance, well they got wise and kept cutting my limit LOL you're punished either way! I really try not to buy anything on credit, but am not gonna lie that i had to put a lot of gas fill ups on my credit card when i had no money to get to my appointments.... But things i buy, food, clothes, furniture- i pay cash.... Kel- I am only saying this out of pure love for you and I know you are a spiritual person. Read Acts the 27th chapter. This is the story of Paul (as a prisoner) sailing to Italy. There was a huge storm which terrified all the people on board. After days of being in the storm the sailors tried to flee on the skiff but Paul warned them that they needed to stay on the boat and to \"Be of good cheer\" (Acts 8:22) that no one will be lost only the boat. That ship that the men stayed on is what saved them, although it did break apart, the men that couldnt swim used planks from the ship to float ashore. The very thing they were trying to flee had saved them! Had they gone off on the skiffs they would have surely died. Sometimes when we are caught in the storms of life such as credit ratings and such we just see the ship that is sinking. And its hard to be in good cheer as Paul suggests. But his optimisim came based on the knowledge that no one was going to perish. I know i am trying to go somewhere here LOL but its like everything i am thinking isnt good enough. What I want to say to you is let them do what they want, pay them in your own time- I am super happy to hear your mom is stepping in and is able to loan you the money. Money is just paper, not nearly as valuable as your life. Matthew 6:24 \"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.\"  (7 years is a lot of tomorrows ) Ginger- i am doing the happy dance with ya girl!!!!!",

Sounds cool!

OH DID Y'ALL HEAR ABOUT THE SPECIAL ED TEACHER THAT WAS BULLYING HIS STUDENT?????? HE THREATENED HIM WITH PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AND SAID SOME MEAN AND HURTFUL THINGS- (he even called him a \"tard) I thought the irony of the whole thing was this teacher felt his student was a stupid retard, yet this student used his cell phone to RECORD the whole incident (i guess it had been going on for a while and the parents told him to record it) So whos the stupid one? Of course the teacher is on paid administrative leave, but i doubt he will ever be able to teach again.... off to the library, bank, post office and then physical thearpy! Adios",

Well i saw in a magazine at the P/T to organize all those season packets we accumulate like chili season and taco seasons lol, to hang one of those clear plastic over the door shoe pocket things. and divy them up... so i was on this hunt to find one- of course no one carries the cheap clear ones anymore- i could only find canvas ones... so i looked online and they wanted way too much for them!

Lizzy- about the occupy wallstreet and the pepper spray, i was outraged when i saw this vidoe of these cops spraying these students that looked peaceful just sitting there with this thick fog of orange pepper spray until i saw the full video 2 days later, apparently the students had surrounded the officers and wouldnt let them pass- they on multiple occations gave the students the option to move so the officers could get through and they chose not to so they got sprayed...  i totally understand the right to free speech and being able to gather, but when you're on private property (which the university is) you are subject to their rules and one of their rules was no camping- simple as that- if they feel for the movement then go to NYC and make your voice heard! Oh and dont get me started on Geraldo- he was interviewing a guy in NY and the guy said he was a welder and was just wanting to work ( there are a lot of union jobs and stuff the prevent some ppl from being hired) he said something along the lines of \"i dont want to make millions i just want to make 50,000 a year\" Geraldo's response \"You'd really work for only 50,000 a year!\" Like he was shocked. Um excuse me but how many americans work and live off less than that! How much money do you make Geraldo where $50,000 a year is an insult.

Hopefully if it is back its still localized and you can do Rads to put your mind at ease. Went to the internist today he thinks its pleural effusion.

Waiting to exhale is my all time favorite movie!!! I grew up listening to her music it is so sad the way her life turned out. I might just be calloused because of dealing with people in my family having drug addictions. Honestly I feel that she had \"died\" when she couldnt shake her addiction. My youngest sister is a heroine addict and its hard for me to think of how sick she has become. She actually showed up at the hospital high and left early to score WHILE my dad was still cohearant. So anyhow one night (about 2 years ago) after calling every hotel, motel, hospital and jail in her area looking for her cuz i hadn't heard from her in months i realsied to me the sister i had know had died, whats left of her is no where near her old self. She did get clean for 2 months but relapsed this past october. So in my very humble and honest opinion the Whitney we all loved and knew was long gone before her passing. It just makes me sick that all these people go onto national tv talking about how last week she looked messed up- Yet they didnt care enough to do anything about it then- only when its too late do they same a dang thing.",

I dont have a PCP, just onco and gyno both whom dont give out immunizations so i was looking for a PCP today and this one office asked me all sorts of questions for a new patient appointment like if i work (whats that got to do with anything, my husband works and supports us... Any how after all that they were like oh we dont do immunizations here, after the dept of health and given me their number. I think because one of the questions was what meds am i on and i listed a bunch they were thinking drug addict LOL and just turned me away. Sorry i have to take all this crap LOL SO anyhow i have an almost 1 hr drive each way tomorrow to get it done, and the positive thing is they only charge $5 an immunization. This other place was $20 for the shot and $15 for the fee cuz i have insurance LOL the things we go through! oh saw THE HELP  great movie! I will never look at a chocholate pie again! Later Ladies",

Lizzy- My dislike for the goodwill is 2 things mainly- they get most everything for free (i think some of the larger  goodwill buys close out items) and then they turn around and sell it for more than these things are worth sometimes. Our good will has 1 price for like items. All the jeans are 5 or 6 bucks, which is a great deal when you're buying a name brand pair, but unfortunetly i live in a town where Walmart is our only store for the most part so its walmart brands at more than walmart prices! Blouses are the same story- 4 bucks per shirt when if i shop clearance i usually pay $1 for something new. I have seen low end furniture in there price well over what i KNOW it cost new- so how is this supposed to help those that cant afford to shop at the new stores??? Plus they arent this huge non profit they claim to be (from wiki- i know not the most reliable source) In 2005, Goodwill Industries of the Columbia Willamette (GICW), Goodwill's Portland, Oregon branch, came under scrutiny due to executive compensation that the Oregon attorney general's office concluded was \"unreasonable.\" President Michael Miller received $838,508 in pay and benefits for fiscal year 2004, which was reportedly out of line in comparison to other charity executives and placed him in the top one percent of American wage earners. After being confronted with the state's findings, Miller agreed to a 24% reduction in pay, and GICW formed a new committee and policy for handling matters of employee compensation.[12][13] I was shocked when I read this a few years back (i know there are other articles about this out there) Almost a million dollars to one individual compleatly shocked me... Well not really thats why their items prob cost so much The thrift stores I like to go to are Salvation Army- their proceeds go to homeless shelters and other things like that, our local thrift shop which 100% of their money goes to the local food bank and is ran by voulnteers. So no one has a motive to price the things for an outrageous amount of money. As for being one the familes under the poverty line it's nice to know that i can save a buck somewhere AND help out my local community Well i can smell dinner burning lol i only had a qucik sec and i started rambling LOL i'll be back (think arnold here)",

I know the chances that they come back are slim, but there is always next year. ;) Yes i do remember the wonder years- i did not know he was the director though. The Help- it didnt so much glorify how the help helped to raise children so much as it did shed light on things as a whole. (that child rearing was just a small portion of the movie) But i agree it is a time that we don't need to revisit- although there is still treatment of that sort today. Racism is alive and kicking (especially down in my neck of the woods) So funny because growing upin the North West  I had never dealt with racism- i had friends of all races with no incident (until high school- i wont get into all that) Down here is is a whole other can of worms, i find that different races self-segregate, Its really sad.  Ginger- Glad she is liking the automatic! Hondas are great cars!!!! I have owned 3 in my lifetime, really wishing I hadn't sold the last one but it was a 2 door and I now have kids (thats why we sold it LOL) Oh Lizzy I have one of those sisters LOL she is 2 years younger than me, and my parents had a rule that we could only go with friends that they had met- but my code for going out and partying was \"i am going to go stay at my friend Tara's\" I had very detailed reasons why every weekend she couldnt meet my parents, but i had integrated her into my life \"oh tara and I are doing a report on Lincoln\" LOL i was so shady! well when my sis got to high school and realised she had NEVER seen me with anyone named Tara that something was up. Only thing is she wanted in LOL, so I had to drag my little sister along in order to keep her mouth shut! Ginger- be safe out there on the roads! Redbox- they actually raised their price (at least here) to maybe $1.20 i think- it cost $1.29 after tax. I know 20 cents isnt a lot but imagine if they rent out 1,000,000 movies a day thats $200,000 extra they are making!!!! Little know fact- the Dollar menu is what saved McDonalds from going under- as you know its super cheap to buy food there well they were not making a profit at all- someone came up with the idea start this dollar menu and our profits will increase (at that time they were charging 99 cents for their mcchicken.) That one cent on a few of their sandwhiches turned the business around. Oh and they took off a slice of cheese the double cheeseburger calling it a mcdouble which save them a ton of money too. Ginger I agree it may be worth the extra day or 2 to night walk out in the cold to return the movies! Well everyone enjoy your week!",

      "Content": "Feb 12, 2012 07:19AM - edited Feb 12, 2012 07:20AM by texasrose361 I have some catching up to do- I am in the dog abuse/ mistreating people area of our conversation... Rachel- Sorry to hear about your BIL's father. Lizzy- I am sorry to hear about your mom. Just a brief (or i will try to be) update about me. Last week of Jan. I was told my father was in the hospital and it didnt look good- that he had a few months left. He has chirossis which lead to kidney failure as well. I had started planning a trip for march to go up and see him, but Sunday the 5th- My family called and told me he had taken a turn for the worse and months was not weeks. So i hurried up to see him (literally buying a plane ticket on the drive to the airport) I got in at 11:52 sunday/ almost monday and got to the hospital. The nurse had said they werent able to wake him since around 5 in the afternoon (i got to the hospital around 1 am) around 2 he started moving so i called the nurse in and she was able to wake him. He had very few moments of clarity. But he did realise i was there and we spoke for about 2 hours off and on, when he was awake and stuff. By monday morning around 4-5 he was basically gone mentally. Well physcially too. Before he had gotten so bad he made his wishes known that he wanted to go home to die not in the hospital. We arranged for hospice care- they didnt even think he would make it through the night, but he did and they sent him home. He really hasnt been there mentally at all, and it is heart breaking to see him like that. One thing he did tell me is that he was happy i made it before he died. I am closest to my dad and apparently he had been asking for me the whole day on sunday. Um then i spent tue-thur by his side for the most part, trying to comfort my family. I left Friday morning and arrive home around 10 last night. I got less than 10 hrs sleep in those 5 days so i have slept the whole day away. not sure if it is just catching up or also jet lag. My dad wasnt responding at all on thur and most of wed but apparently fri he was. My strong suspicion is that he is waiting for someone to say goodbye to although he cant communicate who.... They literally have been saying it might be minutes to days that he will pass. Thanks to Lizzy checking in on me and reminding me about my appointment for my lung, I got that rescheduled for Monday and I will let everyone know how that goes. Oh and waking me up this afternoon- LOL you somehow just knew to contact me at the right times. Oh and something wonderfully awesome- during my lay over i was checking my voice mail and the case worker for the kids i mentioned WAY back when called and we are starting the homestudy on MONDAY!nervous and happy!!!!",

But the term NED does exist because its not evaluble. Have a lot more to say but my brain isnt working LOL need more sleep but DH left for work at 2:30 so i'm on duty LOL (kids)",

Didnt have internet for almost a month @ home at a few weeks on my cell (had to cut hte fat so to speak) tried getting on line at the library about a week after chemo- ended up getting sick- felt like the flu, ran a fever- ALMOST had to go to the ER but luckily it went away! Been feeling GREAT this last week- i actually walked a mile in 110 degree weather (long story) My hair started falling out in major clumps the past week, so i shaved it- The mowhawk that i planned didnt quite work out! Anyhow its about 1/4 an inch to 1/2 and inch long, and even thats just falling out- thinking of shaving it bald to not have to clean up ANY hair!...

I say \"TELL ME!\" i want normalcy in my life. I am the go to friend when it comes to a shoulder to cry on when life gives you a brick wall! Its so ard for me to NOT help them out. Although a few ppl have turned my DX into THEIR problem- woe is them lol- to that i just quietly say (to my self of course) if you want to act like you're the one dying (i def dont feel like i am dying though) then go off into a corner and leave me the heck alone LOL My sister in law had \"pre-cancerous\" cells on her cervix because of an STD (HPV) she had them removed (painfully yes- my sister also had that done) But she acted like she was dying and blah blah blah- this was over 5 years ago, she's better now. I just love how she's telling me how when she went through her cancer fight (in my head i keep thinking STD STD STD lol) this and that happened. She actually made me promise that i wouldnt give up! (WTH! you really think i am about to say \"lets lay down to die... lifes not worht living...\" FIGHT is an understatement!) Anyhow she is a compulsive liar. She's constantly cheating on her idiot-man-child husband, and she wants to compare her \"cancer\" with mine.... WOW THAT VENT JUST POPPED OUT OF NO WHERE LOL calamtykel & kimmie anti nausea meds round the clock? I have compozine but only take it for the first 3 days after chemo- then as needed (havent needed it) The smells kill me the first few days but then I get that part of me back to normal. I have not been constipated but have had diahrrea for first few days... Funny you went running- I have this URGE to run, i just feel so damned good- I did do a mile walk (had the kiddos) Its the last few days before chemo so i know this feling of euphoria isnt gonna last forever. Running makes me feel so clean and fresh! ckptry the comp makes me foggy as well and its harder with the kids being home (or me picking up DD from school) the first few days after chemo is lie around together looking at books or watching movies... i make up for it as soon as the nuasea is gone. I took them to the tennis court to run around for at least 2 hours! Rachel- Sorry you're feeling terrified. I've had a terrible '08-'10 lol its been one thing after another starting with my husband losing his job.... just remember al the things you've faced and overcome! This will turn out to be nothing!!! ((HUGS)) Keep us updated! And you're in my tohughts and prayers! Keepingthefaith-  my only suggestion is be aware of neutropenia after about day 4 or so I felt GREAT! So i went out into public and ended up getting sick really quick! I am glad you havent had any real SE! thats awesome hopefully all your other chemo treatments follow suit!",

I'd love a liguor induce rumination! Best get it out of your system while you can still drink ;) You OWN hair weave idea LOVE IT!!! Side note when i complaine to my frineds that i cant drink they all remind me that i dont drink anyways (prob bout 2 years since my last drink) I calmly say to them if anything is gonnadrive a person to drink it would be being told that you have stage 4 breast cancer! that cracks them up!!! Cptry- mouth sores- my mouth started feeling scaly and tender, so i uped the amount of times i mouth washed that seemed to help a little. Also a tip i got dehydrated then because i didnt want to drink anything (taste and pain) so just remember to push the fluids! calamtykel- WHAT AN AWESOME FRIEND! Gingerbrew- Sounds like you had a great visit!!! I dont recall EVER seeing a slug in AZ (even during the monsoon season) so i bet she was just AMAZED! Growing up i'd try to keep slugs as pets but my mom would freak out lol. i remember seeing this 11 inch or so banana slug it was GROSS/AWESOME! ABOUT HAIR LOSS- okay so i lost a large majority of my hair and shaved the rest off. Now my pink spots are starting to get a little fuz on them, what up with that? The texture is all off though, then the parts that still had hair are growing 2 so i have 2 lengths of hair lol, need to take a razor to it to even it out! Oh yeah and its lighter than my hair too, like a light brown and my hair is a dark brown.... My husbands therory: my 1st treatment was done on a friday and i had to wait til monday for my nuelasta shot, but this round of tx was done on monday so i didnt have to wait.... Any thoughts on this? I see my onc tomorrow for a follow up to the hospital stay so i will ask him. Oh yeah and my down town hair is gone, but not my leg hair but thats growing extremly slow, i haved over a week ago and its slightly pokey where normally within 2 days of shaving i'd have to shave again! same story with my underarms! ENJOY THE HOLIDAY EVERYONE!!!",

I like the friendly atmosphere of my oncologists office. I actually dont mind the infusion room, we have about 10 or so chairs and I like knowing that i am not the only one in the world with cancer, we smile or talk amongst each other. I am by FAR the youngest person their, then next youngest person i would guess to be in at least their 60s so huge age gap (thats my grandparents age) but they are all nice although they give me that side smile that i take as (oh poor young girl having chemo) I find when i wear my bandanas ppl will ask me about my situation and offer prayers, it is akward sometimes cuz ppl sorta guess i have cancer and its not private but i love educating ppl (espcially the Younger women who arent even thinking about BC) so awesome someone paid your chekc! calamity- AWWWW, thank you.

Um yeah and not the light and airy gas that is hardly noticable either! The \"OMG who the hell farted\" type of gas that you def dont want to admit it was you. Make it up to your son by taking him somewhere when y'all get the chance free- like a local skate park or something.... Its hard finacially- my 5 yr old so wanted to do tap lessons we even bought her the shoes, but i was dx in july and the lessons started in Aug so we had to cut that out. There is always next yr.... Sharonkw-i had shortness of breath but it was hardly noticible after this last tx, the first 2 i would get winded walking from the car to front door! Gingerbrew- Sometimes we joke and make situations a little more lighthearted than they should be, but that is our way of coping. I know depression is VERY real and have 1sthad experince with it. I think cancer is one of those topics that we often joke about to lessen the emotions we have dealing with them. I am glad you wrote what you did to open our eyes and also glad that you accepted her apology. (((HUGS TO ALL))) Sohard-Whats new that ya? SE minimal i hope! Haircoloring- Okay i am so silly, i walked down the isle that they keep the hair color and thought- i should dye my hair then i laighed and thought \"what hair!\" I totally forgot i was bald!",

I mean they go to school just the same (although its a private school and they have secret service bodyguards) they still should have falen into the risk groups that needed a shot. I just thought the vaccine came out too quickly from the first outbreak of H1N1- what about research and all that LOL.... Anyhow I wont be getting an h1n1, lets see what my dr says on thur about the reg flu shot... Follow up on thursday with my oncologist. He had mentioned that after my 3rd tx i should get scans done to see if all my mets are responding to the chemo. I am hoping that either i can get them done thur or at least get them scheduled!

I see him 2 weeks after the chemo and then when i am actually getting it done he pops in to see how everything is going in my life. he is a great dr. i know he has other patients and i dont expec him to spend the 3 1/2 hrs in there with me but its nice that he comes in at least once. On a slow day i'll see him 2 or even 3 times (when my sister in law showed up he came in quite a few to see how i was doing emotionally- or maybe to gossip lol) I thought i saw english teacher on the stage IV board but i may be mistaken... I updated my pic to a pic my son took of me (i helped him aim though)",

I will STOP that starting NOW! i dont want any more pain than i already have or an infection either! Calamity- Decadron??? Is that a steroid? i take dexamethason (2 day before 2 day of and 2 day after tx) Sptmm62- I love your oncologists sense of humor... so about a month or so for the SE to fade away....hmmm.... You had positive nodes, dont they automatically do radiation to the auxilla (thats the underarm right?) lol jsw19- Oh i had an echo cardio gram done not a MUGA... they didnt have to inject anything they actually did it after i woke up from my port surgery!  I havent put thought into my cancversary lol i def wouldnt want to have it for the dx date because why celebrate THAT day! I think i like marking the day i was DONE with treatments! Thats a more positive versary than a bad news one... LOOK FOR THE BLESSINGS EACH DAY!: Sometimes this is hard just because what we're going through but i just want to share so many positives that have happened in my life recently. My husbands in law enforcement and a lot of apartments let you live rent free if you patrol the complex and such (i think they said put in 18 hrs a week) Well anyhow we got a call that an apartment was looking for one, ben went over and picked up an application- i filled it out and went to turn it in but they were closed :( i came back today and the manager was so nice- she said something along the lines she was worried that he wasnt gonna turn it in- which i take as a good sign that they are intrested in us!!!! BTW its a 3 bedroom we are so cramped in our tiny apartment. They have nicer grounds and a playground (our current complex doesnt) It def would be a step up! My husband made the tactical (SWAT) team with his department, and they went onto a 4 10s schedule at work so he has 3 days off!!! It actually feels like a mini vacation when he has time off... Also i started writing a journal, well more like a love letter to my children. Not that i feel i am dying or anything morbid, but i think it would be neat for US together to look at it 20 years from now and say oh yeah i remember that time... The weather is so faboulous lol i took my son to the park this morning and therer was dew on everything!!!! About time! its been so dry and hot even when we wake up, but it was nice getting out with him!!!! HAVE A BLESSED DAY Y'ALL!!!!!!",

Okay so as y'all may remember i was due for my annual woman's exam and was NOT happy with my old gyno so i find this women's clinic that came highly recommended. they had a LONG waiting list for an appointment so it was what 3 weeks or a month that i waited for my appointment..... Anyhow i go see my PCP first (since i drive an hr into town i like to buddy my appointments when i can) My lungs are doing good- says sounds completely cleared up! keep on with the steroid inhaler!!! I then drive to my new gyno's office- fill out the mountain of paperwork and there is this one question that i have NEVER been asked before except when having surgery \"Do you accept blood transfusions\" and the check yes or no boxes... Do to religious reasons I do not accept blood transfusions and checked no of course. well the receptionist asked me about it, i explained religious beliefs. then they call me back for my appointment... duh dun duuuuuuuuuun (cue the creepy music) So the nurse takes me into an exam room and said \"we dont accept patients that dont accept blood\" i am SHOCKED! i am like \"well this is a pap i doubt i will need a transfusion for this\" LOL she was explaining that the drs all got together and decided that they dont want to treat people that dont want to take blood in case of an emergency.... I was getting more and more pissed as she is talking because A) i drove an hr there and gas ain't cheap! and B) they could have EASILY told me this over the phone. So i am like \"i want to speak with your director of the clinic\" i was in the exam room nearly a half hour waiting for the lady LOL so i can feel my pulse racing and my anger coming to a boil LOL (side note- i HAVE been asked in the past strange questions by the dr office OVER THE PHONE- when i was looking for a PCP this one office asked me a million and one questions like my age, if i took medications and my health history- seriously over the phone. And after i mentioned \"oh i am 29, a stage 4 cancer patient, on a few different meds...\" they said \"oh the dr isnt accepting new patients\" so i know this can be done!) Okay so in walks the director. SHe introduces herself and she dang near crushed my hand bones her grip was so hard. She basically said the same thing the nurse said and i told her that it was a waste of my time and money to get there and this was something that could have EASILY been said over the phone. she says its against their policy to say that over the phone. i say to her \"i drove an hour to come to the appointment, y'all could have at least said when i made the appointment 'yes we are accepting new patients except for those who....' instead of having me drive all this way\" SHe said \"oh we cant ask those types of questions over the phone such as ethnic background, if you're overweight ect... because it would be discriminatory\" so i cut in and say \"so you're admitting that its discriminatory to refuse a patient based on their willingness to accept blood!\" she was like \"no, its a policy that the drs in the practice agreed upon, and we're not able make an exception\" I mentioned my advanced directive would cover their liablity that they are claiming they have (but no they wouldnt be held liable if i refused- with or without hte AD!) she keep repeating that \"we are in the business to save lives and so we wont see anyone that wont accept blood\" I calmly said to her \"ma'am this is an annual exam i highly doubt the dr is going to puncture through my uterus and require me to have a blood transfusion!\" she said what if in the future i needed a surgery and i needed blood, they wouldnt accept the fact that i wouldnt take it so they just wont see patients that refuse. I then said \"ma'am i am a stage 4 cancer patient and i take my health care very seriously. i do not go to second rate doctors and y'all came HIGHLY recommended. I have an oncologist, i have a surgeon and i have a PCP so the chance of me ever needing your doctor to preform a surgery is nil\" the las t thing i left her with is the fact that my insurance BETTER not be billed for this visit. because as you know they run our insurance before the visit and  make us pay our co-pays. well i have a primary and secondary insurance the secondary basically covers my co-pays... she assured me that they wouldnt but i am going to be watching my EOB like a hawk. i know i am probably leaving a large chunk of the conversation out but i am too tired lol oh so i am now going to have to drive to San Antonio for my gyno too now, i am going back with the one that delivered my daughter. i really liked her. so monday i am going to call and make the appointment :) night ",

BTW i think that my dr's great bedside manner is due to the fact that his mom died of cancer when he was a young teenager. Lady- isnt it presumed that ALL of us, or all of the US i should say since our rates of cancer are so high, that we all have mutated cells, thus it could be said that we have dormant cancer cells- even though on a scan nothing would show up of course because its not large enough, but isnt it THERE???? not trying to freak anyone out of course, just my 2 cents :) ",

Do not know if they have a complaint department, lol whenever i have asked i have always gotten one of those automated lines, which doesnt do much! Sorry about not getting on and mentioning my biopsy- i get so busy during the week while the kids are at school i had seen my dr on monday and he said i would be needing a biopsy- found out maybe tue or wed abut the biopsy gonna be friday... Remember i mentioned my persistent coughing, well my xrays are showing what appears to be bronchitis but only in one lung which my dr said its rare for it to occur like that so they wanted to go in and do a bronchoscopy (take a camera down there and check things out) and also biopsy not only the area showing up on the xrays but also random samples.... So i had to be at the hospital at 8 friday morning, meaning i had to leave my house by 5:30 because i was going to be under anesthesia i had to have a ride home, my husband got the night before off (he works midnight shift) and we loaded up and headed out. about a block away i realised i forgot my phone but since i was going to be asleep during this procedure and probably drowsy on the drive home i said oh no worries about that i will just call/text people when i get home. So it was only supposed to be a 2 hr thing no problem... Let the nightmare begin LOL so i come out anesthesia to my husband standing there and the dr explaining that they will need to insert as chest tube i am like not understanding whats going on, but apparently while i was under i may have coughed while the biopsy was going on (thats what they are claiming) and they punctured my lung causing air to do something LOL i really dont remember the whole explanation- it was called a pnuemothorax something . the same thing that happens in a case where you get shot in the lung as well.... Anyhow- so they bring me back to the OR and just inject the area with lidocain and proceed to enter a tube into my lung, i am not one drop f bombs but one did slip  LOL! so then the wheel me back out to wear the recovery area is waiting for a room to open up because they wanted me to stay over night for observations... i am SOOOOOOOOOOOOO thirsty as i had to fast for this thing, and in a LOT of pain, i am begging the nurse to give me water or something to eat and some pain medicine... BTW at this time its before noon... they are refusing saying its not the drs orders etc.... some dr comes down and i ask him if i can eat or drink he says yes and i hear him telling the nurse that i can have something to eat and drink. needless to say the nurse NEVER got me anything. I didnt get put in to my room til almost 5- with NOTHING to eat since 8 the night before and still no pain meds. they are trying to have me move into the other bed, not the gurney type i was in, but i am in so much pain i am refusing LOL, they said we'll pull the sheet over and i am absolutely refusing to be moved, i cant lift my right arm without wanting to pass out so i just am not going to do it... SO they call the dr up, and the dr that actually did the biopsy and chest insert thing asked me when was the last time they gave me anything for pain, and at this point i am in tears because it truly does hurt like no other pain i have ever felt! i tell her the nurses downstairs were refusing to give me anything for pain. she was shocked because she  said she had put the orders in right after i had gotten out. So they gave me 2ccs of morphine which i appreciated LOL finally i was able to move into the other bed, although my lung with the tube in it had a burning sensation for the rest of the day and the next as well... So in the am the dr sees me and says my xrays look good- this is before 8 in the morning, and i will have the tubes removed and go home, which i am happy about because dh had to miss work AND get a hotel room for the night, so its like we're out double... But of course we didnt get discharged until 3ish!  I am supposed to see my regular dr monday, but wont have the results for a week i am thinking of moving my monday appointment to when the results of the biopsy will be in that way i can kill 2 birds with one stone. It was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO crazy... i know why ppl are afraid of the hospital- they do make mistakes... So now i have this wierd vasaline bandage where the tube was (they said to keep air out) and a much more horrible cough (not sure if thats a real word) Anyhow thats how i spent my weekend, not at all what i had planned :) felis- i am not sure why some rounds of the chemo would hit harder than the rest, but i am sure it has a lot to do with the amount of rest you're getting and also all those things that these ladies mentioned like protien intake. Well i am a slow reader and terribly long winded- my babies are wanting breakfast.... hmmm i wish i could order breakfast to be delivered like i can dinner and lunch LOL ttyl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PS no worries lizzy i had ment to get on here but had been so busy with kids during the day and too tired at night to get on line, my goal is to get on once a week at least and maybe get it bumped up to more times!!!!!!!!!",

I'll tell you where you can put Abe!  And on another note- the whole \"i heart boobies\" craze is just a bunch teens and young adults that want to use the word boobies.

Lizzy- i dont remember you mentioning that, but i am so in and out on the board and this last hiatus i didnt end up reading to catch up, so if any of y'all got married or had a baby in theose 2 months i dont know about it LOL Um yeah they're  idiots- you dont get MRSA that way and yes you're right ppl can be carriers of it and never have an out break. my sisters little boy had/has it- in his case it presented itself like diaper rash. Finally she took him in to his peditrician and she found out that it was MRSA- very painful boil type thing that she had to medicate. i dont blame you for walking out. i mean hospitals are NOTORIOUS for getting people sick! I cant remember if i updated- i have a dr appointment TOMORROW... looking forward to it, cant wait to get it out of the way! Oh and need some advice- my upstairs neighbor lets her infant cry for anywhere from 15 minutes to 30 minutes at all hours of the day. i wake up to it, i am hearing it right now as i am typing this, i go to bed with it.... i mean its nearly a constant! Do i say/do anything? I mean i want to go up there and soothe her baby everytime i hear it because its a maternal instict, but maybe she is a stressed out mom that needs a break???? Also she has a toddler and he is up everynight well past 2 or 3 in the AM- i can hear him running around and playing with his cars, that honestly makes me think that this mom uses drugs or something and is up all night and sleeps all day.... just a side note as i am hearing the baby crying (again)",

I really do like this dr, all but the time mismanagement in the office but thats not his doing thats his staff....... felisa- Sorry to hear that, are you  going in today? What have you tried at home? Red meat may boost your count. There are books out there that identify the problem related with chemo (low blood counts, nausea, etc...) and they have meals that will counter that. I dont know the title of the book i had, because i passed mine on to another cancer patient, but i have seen it at the book store- if you'd like i could pick one up and mail it to you. (I will be getting one myself b/c i am going to be doing chemo again too) and could mail it to you- PM me your address if you'd like :)",

Oh and its not lung cancer, its still breast cancer- IDC still the path was clear on that. From the way my dr was talking this film isnt normal.... hmmm i am not sure if he just meant he had never seen it before or if its just so uncommon in the way breast cancer is know to metastasize.... just the vibe i got off of him, nothing he said specifically. I totally agree a positive mindset is half the battle! if you go into this feeling defeated then you'll prob have a much harder time with all the SEs... i know that whole mess with my sister in law that stressed me out made one of my treatments absolutly awful! It was by far the worse time i had out of ALL my treatments. She had defeated my spirits so i was so down and worried when i did that chemo and it totally showed with how crappy i felt physically! LMBO! I will do! But i agree out of sight out of mind for people. I think that is what my sister in law was so hung up on (i had to be faking it if i was doing so well LOL) RE vcr: sadly you are :( our vcr went out the other day, i either need to remove the case and clean the heads (which i have to do because i dont think anyone still has vcr head cleaner) or throw it away! The vcr is in my children's room as i find tapes are WAY more durable than disks. DVDs just scratch too easily! I can not afford to replace all their movies at 20+ bucks a pop! Hopefully it cleans!

Oh THEY DO KNOW about that, there is just way too many ppl involved in my care so the communication between them all is outrageous! The thing is they wouldnt do the zometa before i saw the dr although zometa is seperate from my chemo, the zometa is for my bones so i will take it always and forever regardless of my chemo, so i told them remember i need to be back by a certain time they said dont worry (well they never ordered the med from the in house pharmacy so when i finally got to go to the chemo room i waited a good 15 minutes for it to arrive- had they just ordered the medicine while i was waiting to see the dr, it would have been ready) Well honestly i had to skip lunch on my way home in order to get there on time, but i was late anyway to pick up my kids. funny one of the chemo nurses that i have had often, sorta stepped in for the other that was taking her sweet time. because the first knew i was in a time rush. Honestly the one i had wasnt the best, she spends so much time doting over these sick/elderly patients and basically ignores me. i know i dont look sick but hey i have advanced stage cancer and need a little time too. ",

One car place we went to tried to tell me he was giving me the part at cost and it turns out he DOUBLED the price of it. i called the auto parts store to see what they sell for and i was shocked, but like Lizzy pointed out people are a shifty lot! Awww Felisa- We love you too! Glad to hear it is healing. How often does she come in to check it?",

No joke since now i have a 17 yr old living here, who is up later than me, she has informed me that in the wee hours of the night i get up and eat. I've polished off plates of brownies, bowls of ice cream. Left over dinner... LOL i hve very few recollections of any of that and what i do remember is more like a dream than a reality! SO strange but true! It might explain my inability to lose weight! Also i sometimes wake up and it feels like my stomach is eating itself- like i am starving- i've deduced that these are the nights that i dont eat! Oh and my 7 yr old will watch QVC and swear we need this stuff- she's been watching the jewelry part since maybe 2 or 3 yrs old. I have never bought anything from there but she will try her hardest to convince me- usually quote what the sells person is saying!!!! Do you think this woman was raped while she was in a 1/2 sleep state? Send me the link to the article- that is very intriguing!  Felisa- SO true!!!! You stumbbled onto our thread and have been a wonderful precense! I am sorry you felt that suicide was the only end for you. So glad you didnt succeed and found us! Lizzy is right- that is a taboo subject among cancer patients and probably the rest of the world because we've been taught to \"fight\" \"survive\" and \"dont give up\" but honestly this crap is HARD! just financially it has taken a toll on me! Sometimes i think it'd be easier to just die. I am stage 4 by the way so that just may happen eventually, but my train of thought was -why the heck am i putting all this time and effort into me just having a good quality of life when in the end i might just succumb to this disease. Then i see the light in my children's eyes and remember i have a greater purpose :) rachel- i have also had some pains in that area. Weird- when i have a BM my abdomen hurts! it sorta feels like menstrual cramps- i see my dr next week and was planning to bring that up.... Maybe you should move your appointment up before march, unless you're comfortable holding off til next month. (me i am a hold off person LOL) The green drink sounds yummy with the fruit in it! Could we use canned pineapple? (i hate dealing with fresh LOL)",

Having scnas next week in order to get a base line... other than that just living live bein a mommy! Sorry if my comments are old but i am doing 2 pages of reading and catching up here. Lizzy- I agree physical thearpy is tortureous! I hated every minute of it, but am thankful it is over and worked! Ginger- I am so sorry for your loss of your friend Melissa- there is a communication breakdown between dispatch (when you call 911) and the officers. Ask any police officer and they will say vital information sometimes isnt given to the officers in a timely manner and  after reading the newspaper article and also your story made me see that this seemed to have been a perfect storm of events to create this senseless death. I am not familiar with Silver alerts, but you would think that officers would be. On more than one occation my husband has had the ability (meaning justifiable cause) to use \"deadly force\" yet he uses his other skill set as a martial artist to take down the bad guy without killing them. ANd do you know what his fellow officers say \"Man you should have just killed the guy\" Serousily that is the mindset on a large majority of police officers. Look at Ruby Ridge and Waco, both instances will tell you that they \"shoot first and ask questions later\" It is a terrible thing for her cousin to have put the officers on the defensive by making it seem as though she was armed to the teeth and out to kill. But keep her life in your memories and not her death. Once again I am truly sorry for your loss. I will keep you and all those that she touched in my payers! Ginger- Whoop whoop on the good mammo! Painting class sounds fun. Sounds to me like you're ready to reenage in life again! Baby steps woman, baby steps. When people say when you fall off the horse you need to get right back on they really mean, start off with a pony! ;) Cant wait to read about the sleep study results. I feel like I am reading a book and can skip to the end but I wont. I will read in order! Rachel- Remind me again where you traveled to? Lizzy- You listed the top 5 cancer hospitals, what is the top ten? I have googled and not all sites have the same list... Debbi- thanks for your post I now know that the frozen 4 has something to do with hockey LOL i was puzzled for a minute! Felis- How are you doing? It is always wonderful to read your posts! Your endurance is always inspiring to me! Boston tragedy- I also watched in horror as this case has unfolded. It is a stark reminder that it is the intent behind a person and not the weapon they carry. I actually just read an article in the Saturday Evening Post at my oncologists office that detailed a teacher that had befriended a studen who had confided in her that her group of friends were going to pull off a school shooting that was going to be \"bigger and better than columbine\" A lot of people are out there that are missing the compassion gene. Lizzy- you said \"seeminging well adjusted\" sociopaths can wear many masks and have us all fooled. What makes me the sickest is listening to the news go on and on about the surviving brother's FB fanpage- what the heck! why even mention that at all. Do not give these sorts of people the attention they crave. Rachel- Indian as middle eastern? I loved that episode of the Office where Mindy took Michael to some Indian function. cant recall if it was a wedding or not. Speaking of the office I am sad to see it go off the air, but there are still re-runs! Sue- what is typical weather in Iowa like??? Hows the treadmill working out? Lizzy- 26 years is a wonderful amout of time to get out of a cancer dx! I love dr's humor! rachel- whoop whoop on good teast results! sue- we also have a weird cold front move it where i had to dig out the long sleeved things and jackets.  felis- i bet you look adorable with your short hair. Sometimes i miss mine being so short (like when i am getting hair out of the drain!) rachel- that ostomy video was pretty cool. We now live in a day and age where we dont keep everything in the dark. before it was like sweep everything under the rug, dont talk about it and it doesnt exist. which for people having whatever it is that isnt talked about it makes them feel ashamed, outr of place and different. I like that she went to the streets and SHARED! wow chrones disease at 8! thanks for sharing!!!! ginger- i miss my slugs! SO funny, as a child maybe 6 or so i would try to have pets slugs and my sisters told on my when i kissed one. My mother absoultly forbade me to pick them up anymore. now that i think of it i dont think i have seen one slug in Texas ever... hmm got me thinking maybe they dried out here LOL I think you'll do well with your DGD- at 2 1/2 they are very mobile and can climb where needed. My son was 2 1/2 when i got DX'd and at that time (right befroe the dx) i wasnt able to pick him up at all because of the cancer that had spread- so i can vouche- IT IS MANAGABLE! (caps were intentional :P)  Oh yeah \"real\" art supplies can be spendy. Buy a crayola set when you're just goofing around and experimenting. I loved water color painting! i bought my 7 yr old a painting knife set (plastic of course) but i want to show her a few things :) Omaz- GASP YOU KILLED MY POOR SLUGS! j/k my mom put salt on them too. :( the only bugs i kill are roaches, mosquitoes and flies, lice, fleas and ticks. All others are free to be (preferably outside) LOL you should have seen me to day freaking out over a jumping spider in my daughters room. Spiders will eat most of my listed bugs so i let them live LOL Lizzy- Why was your neighbor burning copper? ANd i agree it is very pretty when it burns. I have seen people use a blow torch to creat works of art on copper... I will be praying for Mike in Maine and all the people in your  old neioghborhood that might be fighting a dx of this crazy disease! I felt like that after the gulf coast thing. they were trying to say gulf coast shrip are safe. Um how long was the BP piple line POURING into the gulf???? No i will stick with the other stuff! Ginger- That rock reminded me of this rock we played on for hours on end. We would play \"king of the mountain\" hide behind it in hide and go seek, just lounge on it. I buried my beloved cat behind it. I was sad when i went home to visit and it was gone! I did see the bear right off the bat, but got transfixed on the boulder when you mentioned it was 3 feet tall! Pretty bear! Sorta scary it being that close though! Lizzy- I got a chuckle out of your tuna explanation. Its true we can never know 100% where our food is from and if it is even what its being sold as (hear about the \"chicken\" in china turning out to be rat???) but at least it eases our minds some when we ask and get a sounds good answer! Ginger I got an even bigger chuckle out of the fact you thought she was buying canned tuna...  I really did miss you ladies!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lizzy good luck with your hunt! Debbi- Hey back! I just do not have the patrience to work with a machine. I hand sew and really dont care if my lines are 100% even! LOL my husband bought me a sewing machine proably a singer or something and i could never get that darned thing to work correctly- something with the bobin or whatever that other side of the string is on the underneasth. I realize i sound like a loon lol! I WAS JUSTTHINKING THAT TOO- WE ARE ALL APPROCHING OUR 3 YEAR MARK.... makes me wonder where the heck everyone one went! OH AND I WANT TO STATE I MUST BE DOING MY JOB AS A MOTHER CORRECTLY BECAUSE MY TEENAGER HATES ME!!!!!!!",

My sister flew down from washington and visted me with her 3 kids for nearly 2 months. They left WHEW! I felt like i was living in a zoo. We had a 3, 6, 8 and two 9 and a 13 year old all in a small 3 bedroom. We sure did step on eachothers nerves. But i enjoyed the visit just the same! My husband had never met my 9 yr old nephew or 3 yr old neice cuz he never made the trips back home like the kids and i did. The kids are back in school which gives me a lot more time to rest or clean. I do a little of both throughout the day. Rachel sorry to hear about your MIL, i am glad your boys are doing well, we were in that situation with my MIL some wanted her to go into a nursing facility while others wanted her to remain at home (without them actually the ones who care for her) its a damned mess. Hope your family peacefully agreed on whats best for her. Hockey already?!?!   :) I am doing moderatly okay. I have scans coming up, plus an echo on my heart. I am having what appears to be osteonacrosis in my jaw. Went to the oral surgeon today and they did the xrays (panoramic) and the receptionist figured out that because it is a medical issue (caused by the treatment i was on for the bone mets) we could bill through my medical insurance (i dont have dental insurance so i have been paying for my dental visits out of pocket) which was great news, just the consult was nearly 200! But because of them going thru insurance we have to wait for the approval. NEW appointment next tuesday. My hair is growing back but the oddest thing- the middle of my hair is really thin and plus a few shades lighter than my hair so it makes me look bald in pictures lol my sister is a \"selfie queen\" she takes pictures constantly and when she showed me some of myself i nearly peed my pants laughing so hard! I will try to figure how to post one! Well i am glad to be back!!!!!!!",

She still lives back home in washington and so she looked up the hospital near me and called to see if i had been admitted, she knows my husband is a cop but not what department, she was calling around here asking for my husband (she called the city police but hubby is a sheriff with the county) she even was msging my friends on fb (of course i havent been on FB for 2 months so there werent updates on there or anything) asking if they heard from me ect... i finally got the message and called her last night. Of course she had assumed the worst. I feel so bad my friend spent part of her xmas holiday thinking i died... But i gave her my husbands phone number so if she ever cant get ahold of me she can him! Just makes me realise that she is a GREAT friend, and truly cares! Debbi- Good luck tomorrow!

So even going to the extreme doesnt offer a guarantee!

Most things i just need a refresher for and dont need to take the WHOLE class again- the knowledge is in there somewhere just got to access it (meanin my brain LOL) Rae- well said, if we get busy and caught up in life we're moving forward and not dwelling on our dx! libraylil- Glad to hear you did well- and the footing hte bill part rings so true! Since if i fail i will have to either quit or pay the money to do it all over again i KNOW i am gonna take it seriously! More and more people are going back to school in their 30s and 40s! (i guess htat when we smarten up lol) JSW19-how often do you get the MUGA? i get something similar (ECG) but so far i've only had it once after starting tx (1x before to get a baseline i guess) Sad story about the Toomer trees :( Lizzy-I asked about the pre reqs and she said they aren't necessary cuz they only accept people based on their TEAS score (which is like a placement test or something) the pre reqs help you know the things that will be on the test. these are the categories: basic algebra, advanced algebra, averages and rounding, arithmetic, commas, estimation and sequences, exponents, fractions and square roots, geometry, basic grammar, intermediate grammar, author's purpose, advanced grammar, graphs, basic math, intermediate math, advanced math, measurement, nouns, percents an ratios, basic reading comprehension, reading for the main idea, advanced reading comprehension, reading vocabulary, vocab 1, vocab 2, vocab 3, science 1, science 2, science 3! I have taken a lot of the practice tests and mostly need to focus on the advanced math stuff... I have 3 year old screaming in my ear all day long- i wish my husbands schedule would allow for him to take him somewhere during hte day, but right now hubby works til 8 am then comes home to sleep... I DEF AM GONNA LOOK UP THOSE BOOKS AND FLASHCARDS SO I CAN STUDY THEM AS WELL WHEN I AM AWAY FROM THE COMPUTER edited to add that calculators are allowed on the test- which i thought was weird LOL whoop whoop rachel for finishing RADS! Debbi- thats great to hear about your daughter (i know how our tx can affect their routines too) Are you on anyhting else beside taxotere? I know my hip burning was said to be a SE from my zometa, but its scary having to get it checked out, the xrays and all... Lady-ooooooooooh a lakehouse! Sounds awesome! Show us pics! I totally am planning on applying for all the scholarships i can, and financial aide if possible. I know that SSI/SSDI has a way that you can save for college without being penalized that you have extra money... I am gonna call them on monday to get more info on that.

Awesome! About the NP- i love your witty comeback (even if it never left your mouth) you think like i think!- Speaking of which- i went to that horrible place ppl call \"Walmart\" and needed to get an oil change i chose them cuz they are cheap and fast... i bought my kids ice cream while we waited in the food court (yes our walmart has a food court lol) any how after they finished that we still hadnt been paged so i went back to automotive- i saw my car was the ONLY car in the bay and 3 \"mechanics\" were chit chatting and not doing their J_O_B, the door that leads out was locked (turns out they have to buzz you through) and there was no one at the registar. i waited 10 freakin minutes for them to come in, another car pulled up and they start working on her car (after being in the store over 40 minutes total) finally someone showed up from inside the store and i asked \"is my car ready?\" they said \"oh they arent going to do the oil change because your dip stick is broken\" i said \"thats nice- why didnt y'all page me!?\" she replied \"they must have just found out that problem\" i said \"NO they didnt just find out, i have been sitting here for 10 minutes watching them dick around until the next car pulled in!\" totally not proud that i said that but i did! (they were getting on my last nerve) The mechanic walks in and says the same thing that the cashier said. I said \"i know she just told me\" when we left they were gonna show me it was broken- like i freakin needed to see that! i take their word for it and i will NEVER go back to walmart again. i am so sick and tired of their lack of common sense! (sorry got off on a tangent here LOL) Lizzy yes it is the teas- i take my practice tests on this site: http://www.testprepreview.com/teas_practice.htm  there is another one too that they gave me but i am still working my way through these :) Petition is signed! jsw19- it looks like i am due for the ECG then lol i did have it 3 mo after starting herceptin and its been 3 months since then... prob cuz i had my mx my dr is waiting for me to heal????

I am glad your natural doctor was able to get you feeling better. Whats the added % for you on tamox? If its low like under 10% I'd also say you're better off not going through those SEs :) About your Oncologist- trust is a big thing in any relationship- personal or professional and if you feel you cant trust her then it may be time to find another one. It does seem odd that she said a few things were not SE of tamox yet one of them was listed as a SE and the other many women had experinced as well.... It may not be the most common SE but she should still know about it! Good luck with your oncologist situation :) Adey- Okay so totally my downtown hair is growing SOOOOOOOO much faster than my headhair. Also my under arm hair! I had to shave for the first time since starting chemo! Of all the side effects we get why cant the leg/underarm hairloss stay instead of nuropathy????? Mmhale46- Are you on tamox? for the last couple of days i have had some killer headaches, i just started T and i think that may be the cause of mine.... SO happy to hear the CT came back clear!

I havent had one for over 3 years so i was totally unprepared! Had to rush out to the store to get \"stuff\" lol my panty liners were not doing the job!  I have heard of people getting theirs back after a couple of months and also of them not getting it back at all so its a real crap shoot! libraylil- I start on monday and have my dry run on friday so i'll be a day ahead of you!

Hopefully we get a working health plan in place for those like your children or myself (stage 4) to be covered regaurdless and at the same cost as a \"healthy\" person... (sorry for my little vent LOL) Lizzy- I am wanting to start the fall program, i was actually supposed to take my test yesterday but DH was on-call for work and i couldnt chance not having childcare, so i postponed it til after my rads is over- darn rads being M-F donst give me a chance to take the test til i am done with them....

SO hte pain got bad enough where she couldnt walk then she went in and had an emergency surgery! They said if she hadnt come in when she had it prob would have killed her.... so i totally see the slacker thing",

I was at 1:15 before and i live an hour away, and hubby needs to be at work at 3pm... its 30 minutes on the table and so theoretically if i got seen at 1:15 and drove home at 1:45 i would get there just in time for DH to go to work (he watches 3 yr old while i am dong rads) well of course this week they were seeing me LATE which made me late to get back to our house and husband late for work, after the 3rd time i finally said i need an earlier time cuz i dont want DH's job affected by that... SO now its earlier, but not at a consistent time (that had to fit me in lol) I have been feeling BLAH cuz of the rads being in the MIDDLE of the day- its like i hardly had any time after dropping daughter off at school to accomplish anything, and NO time after rads before needing to pick her up. Errands with 2 kids in tow is hectic!!! LOL Hopefully things start to work themselves out... I hate to read that a few of y'all have had tamox problems... but very happy to hear your drs are listening to you guys and taking care of it, because like carolyn (i think) mentioned. Quality of life!!!! So far i havent had any issues with tamox- i read rachel said it may cause slow weight loss or even gain, its been the opposite for me i lost 5 pounds (but i am exercising as well) My eyelashes are growing back, but they irritate me like little stubble when i close my eyes.",

If the drains are taken out too early that fluid can build up under our skin and sometimes cause lymphademia... Its totally normal for them to still be in. (My step dad whom also had BC had his in for over a month and actually had a total of 4 in place! he was outputting so much fluid he would fill the little bulb thing within an hour after dumpping it... gross i know but true) Seeay- I am glad your sis pointed you this way!, not sure about wearing a pad though.

Havent met with the BS since he did my port, so i will prob get his input again too before any dates are set.... I was told i wont get my port out because of me being stage 4 its known that eventually i'll need to use it again- sorry morbid to think that but oh well... Omaz- yup that seat belt gets me almost every time espcially after chemo its a bit tender, i just happen to turn the wrong way and it sends a pain shooting up! My house has ebbed and flowed with tidiness. Its like one day it looks nice, the next i cant stand to be in it- let alone look at it, and the next its looking nice LOL i think its because i go in and out of sleepyness- yesterday all i wanted to do was sleep, today i am cleaning took my kids to a birthday party and now am gonna sleep as soon as i can get them down. who knows what tomorrow brings... PS- SSI, i applied a while ago and just out of the blue got a check in the mail. No explanation just says SSI on it, also got a thing saying if i had bills from june or july that they could pay for them, unfortunetly or fortunetly my sister in law did the fundraiser and i paid everyhting up, but i got a couple of august bills.... Night ladies, my hip is burning and i cant sit for another minute! ENJOY THE REST OF THE WEEKEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Steri strips and medical tape gives me blisters (not sure if its the plastic or the adhesive) but paper tape doesnt. My only tip with that is where your support is on the tubes- use the paper tape on the skin but use the reg tape on the actual tube itself, the paper tape slips a little on the tube and i found out hte hard way for the supporting piece of tape to not use the paper. (if any of this makes sense LOL- i am not sure how your dr showed you how to bandage it up) ***~*~*~*** For those of you who didnt get recon or TEs or anything- does it feel weird to not have breasts?

I just read 3 pages and was writing down everything and then i came across your post! Cut and paste works better! Sorry i have been off line... Everything is going too well after the BMX! (so thats great)- taking my aunt to see the sights here in town. The first week I was mostly laid up in bed. A week after being out of the hospital I got the right drain removed. And tomorrow I am gettting the left drain. Another tip: You'll feel tightness when moving your arms or reaching for objects- its important to strech through that tightness to keep those muscles loose. Even though my aunt is here (she leaves tomorrow) to help me with basically everything, i have made it a point to strech and keep my pectorals limber! SO when i went to have the 1st drain removed my Dr was asking about pain- I havent had any that warrented taking the perscrition, only OTC pain meds, he was shocked and pelased about that. Then he had me touch the back of my head with my hands, one at a time and was also shocked/pleased that i had as much moblity as I did! SO KEEP MOVING LADIES TO INSURE OUR SPEEDY RECOVERIES!!! i am about 95% better- the 5% is my strenghth- not that i could lift millions of pounds but heavy things like a gallon of milk is still a bit of weight for me. (that might be because they did cut some of my left pectoral) I am having fun reading and catching up on everything that I've missed. But I am def back and will be on line daily again! EDITED to add- My path report came back and it was eye opening! Okay so i had an 11cm tumor along the bottom of my breast, and a 3cm tumor near my sternum (it was actually visable looking at my chest), the 11cm tumor had dissolved with chemo but the 3cm one only shrunk- my surgeon had recommended a MX because of the sheer size of the tumor even though it wasn't showing up on scans he was afraid there would be a few live cancer cells that were too small to be picked up. HE was right! The pathologist did see some cancer in the 11cm area, but also a big SHOCKER is there was a small area of cancer towards the underarm area of my breast! It had never been felt there or shown up on any of my scans before! So both me and my surgeon were glad we did the \"extreme\" thing and had the BMX! For those of you who are thinking of getting a MX or BMX after a lumpectomy- I would say: Do what is going to ease your worries. If you're worried of it returning, and that worry is eating you up, do the MX for your mind's sake. I can not relay enough of how relived I feel knowing we \"got it all\". Especially since there was a 3rd area that we NEVER suspected!",

Dunno lol Lizzy- i am def gonna look up that song! i am terrible with names of songs, but if i hear it i might recognise it Lady- How many tx will you be getting? Surprised you lost your hair after only the 1st tx, but be our bodies still arent as strong as before chemo and so it came out quicker. If i am recalling right most of us didnt see hairloss until after a few txs. But hey you've gone through this whole song and dance, know the steps so you'll be more ready this time... Jsw19- thanks",

Re: Drinking- to be honest the last time i drank was Nov 1st 2008, i am sorta a mean drunk. Alcoholism runs in my family and i found when i drank 1 drink i wouldnt stop til i blacked out. Oh i've done some crazy stuff, beat girls up, or really get violent with anyone LOL in that state to wake up the next day and not remember a thing, and i've NEVER had that hung over feeling EVER. Before i had children i quit (LONG story drinking basically ruined a relationship with a close friend) except for the very occational drink, which i would have to tell myself ONE only... That that last drink in nov of 08 was one of those occations a freind and i went out for our bdays and i had A drink... Anyhow my point is alcohol does a lot of things to our bodies and mind, who know if it causes cancer or worsens it or whatever, but its really a personal decision wether to abstain or not... Last week of school for the kiddos and BTW they HAD school today! Who the heck heard of going to school on memorial day!",

Well they were trying to explain this to him, without an interpreter present. Well he flipped out, they couldnt calm him enough to sedate him, so they had to postpone. The next appointment they were sure to get that interpreter! Hearing our not even a teen doesnt want to hear that because its scary! Mija has her kickball afterparty (pool party) today. She's excited to see her friends. Then we head to San Antonio after DH gets off of work. We're going to Sea World again which will be nice. Then i see my oncologist Monday- i am going to ask about anti depressants or anti anxiety meds. I just cant shake this myself.... Also i've noticed that a lot of our used to be frequent posters arent here hardly ever. I hope that means they have moved beyond their dx and tx and are doing well.

Glad to hear its been a year for you and here's to many more!!!!! A brief rant- Okay so as many of you remember i had gone to a dr (well turns out she was only a cna that worked under a dr) in oct and 2 times in march before being dx, i saw her for diffrent breast issues (bloody nipple discharge, pain, and numbnes from my armpit to my hand- just to name a few) she said i was nursing and it was normal go home... Well my oncologist had suggested that i talk with a lawyer and go after her for what is gross neglegince. Well i heard from the lawyer that i had been working with since august that they wont take the case.... they stated it was because in august when i saw the breast specialsit she thought it was b9, but had told me to follow up in dec- i followed up 2 months sooner when i had other problems but because the gal i saw didnt do an exam and obviously no tests they have no way of knowing if i was stage 1 or 2 or even 3 then.  They said they would only have been able to win if they could have proved that i was stage 1 and because her lack of care now am stage 4. Well its stupid because they cant prove this because she DIDNT do her job correctly in the first place, and had she done it correctly in the first place i wouldnt be trying to sure her!!!! Well its back to the drawing board! lol",

BTW where was your vacation at???? i forgot LOL i think they can see things, thats why its recommended you dont have intercourse at least a day before any appointments because it can cloud their view Oh forgot to mention- IS ANYONE A FAN OF KING OF THE HILL???  i am, we were at this flea market called trader's village in san antonio and there was a guy selling BBQ rub/seasoning we checked it out turned out he was Jonathan Joss the voice of John Redcorn- we of course bought his seasonings which he signed and he also signed a pic of the character John Redcord- which of course i framed LOL cuz i am a dork. Anyhow i am kickin myself for not asking him to record my voicemail on my cell- i totally would have paid for him to LOL something like \"Timothea cant take your call right now cuz she has a healing session with John Redcord for her headaches\" LOL anyhow he was super nice, his seasoning is yummy! We even put it on popcorn. BTW he also came out in the new True Grit as one of the native americans that gets hung.... Just thought i'd share!",

My mom is driving me crazy already and i havent even gotten there! Sue you look AWESOME!!!! and yes i also have slow growing hair which i heard was prob cuz of the herceptin- for some reason my bangs wont lay flat they just stick out forward.... Kel- i honestly dont think that medical bills should \"count\" against us, once they go to collections they ruin our credit. i have heard the \"dont pay them for 7 years and it goes away\" heck no i am not gonna try that, i'll just pay my bills as fast (or slow lol) as i can! i just recently paid off a medical bill from 03 or 04 LOL Yeah it sucks when you go into the hospital and get like 4 or 5 bills cuz everyone bills seperatly and you think i have paid this one, but turns out it was another one... Even small time consolidation like per visit would help us out! Well gotta go.... kids are asleep and i want to hop on the wii (we went swimming this afternoon and it wore them out!)",

The same 2 days my daughter had a headache i did too and nothing i took made it go away- hard to tell about the neck pain because i have that often with my messed up discs, so my husband said if i still had a headache the next day for me to go it but lucky it went away. I also felt like i was on the verge of coming down with the flu. The day after my daughter was admitted my son said his neck hurt and he slept a large part of the day.... Who knows, i didnt want him to have to get the spinal tap if it was just viral and from the get go the drs felt it was viral and they only admitted her to error on the side of caution, so who the heck knows!

Lizzy- Bra story makes sense now LOL Omaz- I am really glad to hear your friend is doing okay. Lady- Good idea not to be out with the drunks. I was driving at noon and my DH called and told me to get off the road ASAP because there were quite a few reports of drunks driving from apparently the night before! Noon can you believe it! Lizzy- No sweat girl! I didnt PM you because I didnt want to share it i think i pm'd you because i was checking my PMs and just quickly responded. I should be saying thank you to you for reminding me that I hadnt yet posted. It would have been funny had I talked about taking ASL classes and of of y'all would have been like \"that girl has done lost her mind\" LOL HAHAHA no worries! Oh and the reason I never went to MD Anderson was because its about an hour further (in the opposite direction) to me then San Antonio and I have friends and fam in SA so when i was going for chemo it was much more convenient for them to watch the kids and me stay over night there where i didnt need to pay for a hotel stay every month. I am doing really well right now but DH and i spoke about if i do have progression or something i may look at going there. New Years- Sorry girls i totally meant to get online but I was asleep by 930! Michelle- So good to hear from you! I will be praying!!!!! Lizzy- Negative results!!!!!! thumbs up!!!!! Still have pain :( thumbs down! I would suggest it the pain continues you go to as many specialists as possible to get some answers. True nothing showed up on the mri but it may be something non-cancer related so that might not be the best test to find out what it is.... Kel- Weird about the pain. I had read some where that cancer is the gift that keeps on giving.... Where is the return department? LOL  I am glad you're feeling a little better, but pray that it goes away with no further pain! Bills- I totally feel you girl! I have been trying to pay down what i owe my oncologist and i paid $100 bucks and then when i got the next statement it shows the credit for $100 but the total only went down by $20! I called and they said they'll \"research it\". Just one more thing for me to stay on top of cuz you know they wont get it done unless i call a thousand times! I also had to fight something that had been paid- they were trying to send it off to collections to- i got a notice that it was going to be sent, i called and said my insurance paid and they said well there was a small balance and i was told by my insurance that is the \"write off amount\" (the amount above their contracted limit) and that i shouldnt be charged this. (it was under 70 bucks btw) i relayed that info to the dr office that was billing and she was so RUDE! said she'll look into it ect.... then a few weeks later i got a collection notice for over $1,400 LOL oh boy did they get an earful! Not only did they send off a paid account to collections they sent off an amount that i didnt owe ect.... It took a few months to get that straigtened up and to be honest i havent checked my credit since all this cancer stuff cuz i couldnt care less. Markers- I havent said much on this topic because i dang near got my head chewed off on the stage 4 boards LOL My oncologist who is fresh out of med school (or was when i first was dx'd) said he didnt even learn about markers at school- when he got into his residency he noticed that some of the drs did and he asked about it. What he explained to me is that the TMs havent been that reliable consistently enough to keep testing for them. They dont extend your life at all. They in fact get a lot of people over worried about not much at all. As we all have heard/read a lot about how you come through your dx'd is based on your mental state. No need to add more stress to an already stressed out person. Also sometimes a persons TMs have been very reliable and then all of a sudden they aren't anymore. Imagine if you were told your markers are on the rise and then you think OMG its come back ect and then the dr tells you- oh i guess your markers were wrong this time.... I trust my dr completely and so it doesnt bother me that i've never had my markers tested. Ebay- Yes i have been dinged, i never tried Amazon- i may sometime Wherria- I will be praying for you. We all understand you not getting on frequently. I tend to get anxiety when going on the stage 4 boards. I am NED and A) feel guilty when i read what everyone is going through and B) when i read peoples recurrence it plain scares me! Lizzy- Part of my physical thearpy is massage and i love it! it really has helped! Sorry i was offline for a week! My son had a longer vacation than my daughter and Thur he was supposed to go back, WELL..... wed night i found head lice in my daughters hair!!! which is scary cuz we still mostly co-sleep so we ALL were at risk. wed night i was up til 2 in the am treating everyone and disinfecting our beds. Luckily she was the only one to have it, but we of course all were treated to be on the safe side. Thur instead of sending the kids to school i spent 9am to nearly 2 pm at the laundry mat washing everything and then when i got home i had to bag up everything that couldnt be washed.... BTW i called the school first thing in the AM to let them know, friday i brought her back to school to find out that the nurse never checked any of the other kids. Well i said \"i am just going to keep her home today\" they looked at me like i was an alien LOL i explained it take a LOT of work to rid one's self of this parasite and i am not gonna be doing it again! I called the superintendent's office to complain that now my daughter has to miss yet another day of school because they werent on this like white on rice! (due diligence ppl!) they then called to school who gave a bull faced like about the principal talking with me. Nope that never happened i spoke with the secretary and thats it.... Anyhow, just been super busy with the kids being home ONCE again, first the meningitis then the winter break, then lice... Kel i truly dont know how you do it!!!  ",

And agree- if its ruing your credit for 7 years, why let it ruin everything else- $5 bucks sounds too generous to these jerks! Also your bank will NOT back you up if they take more than agreed upon! Def do money order (banks give those out for free to their customers) or even do a western union transfer which run about $12-15 i had nearly $400 taken from my account once and my bank said because they had the account and routing numbers they were free to do that! So much for payment arrangements! Well my daughter is getting out early and i have to head out! Funny cuz it literally took me an hour to type the above message lol!

My doc says prob due to the radiation. He took me off the antibiotics, put me onto a steriod inhaler for a 2 month trial to see if that helps with my shortness of breath. SO here's hoping!!!! I told him THATS THE BEST NEWS I'VE HEARD ALL WEEK! Sweeny- Nice to hear from ya!!! Walkman- so funny i always associate that with a cassette player type which i DID have and New kids on the block was what i played mostly (i actually still have that tape!)

On a side note- i got them from PA :) so your neck of the woods :) felisaragland42- When i feel like that i wear those really thick socks, i think they are the dr scholls infused with aloe or something, i finds when my feet are cold, my mody cold is more noticiable than whne they are not.  Also a sweater- i took this thinner cardigan with me to cover myself when i get cold. I agree with Lizzy, you'll be able to find a lot of advice on this other thread as these ladies are going through it right now, and we here are 18 months out from our treatments. HOPING FOR THE BEST FOR YA!!!!  More about myself- I seriously am so forgetful, partly chemo related, partly overwhelmed with 2 more kiddos- I have seriously went to the grocery store at LEAST once a day some times up to 3 times because i have forgotten this or that. silly thing is i have written lists, and forget to bring them with me LOL I think this next week will be the last adjustment week and all will be well LOL Oh going to the circus on monday! ",

Ginger- Sorry to laugh but the whole bugler dressed like a ninja was HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!! that was a belly laugh moment! I would have also though that too. It is so hard because as the suburbs expand more into the wooded areas the wildlife's habitat is shrinking, basically  their living area is now butting up to yours and even though YOU dont have food outside and such, your neighbors might and once a bear learns where there is people there is food they will continue to come back. Remember to keep on you this spray for bear attacks. i think it is similar to pepper spray. whenever you go walking have it clipped onto your belt. Also are your trash bins in a raised thing or in your garage? Never leave them by the side of your house or on the ground, they attract not only bears, but raccoons and other wildlife. Good luck! Still waiting on insurance approval for these meds! I figured it would come today, but hasnt yet!",

Oh might make more sense if i mention that i ran into the manager of the gym a month ago at the grocery store.

So with all thats been going on in my life i havent had enough time to sit down and read all this. Been busy- my kiddos took turns being sick last week. Well my niece was sick and hospitalized for a week, then she was released but couldnt go back to school, could harldy open her jaw! The week she went back to school (last week) my younger ones got sick, not at the same time because that would have been too easy. They were sick Mon/tue, tue/wed, and wed/thur. I was sick friday- i guess i caught the same stomach bug they did! Feeling better for the most part this week. We went to look at homes for sale monday. We want to get back to where my husband is from, positive of being so broke is our tax return is enough for a down payment. I am a put the cart before the horse type of person, so i am packing LOL- we ahvetn even made an offer on a house yet, but oh well. Sadly my niece doesnt want to pack until we are for sure moving, she says she doesnt believe in hope. It broke my heart to hear that but i realized in her short number of years, no one person in her life has been a rock for her! She doesnt believe good things will come. Well I gotta fix that! Last day of school is June 7th- We ARE moving June 8th! (well actually i plan to buy the house before then and s-l-o-w-l-y get our stuff over there! Also we are having a yard sale next weekend. Kids have spring break next week, so we'll be doing some spring cleaning! We started last night and it was so funny cuz my kids are pricing their own stuff and one of them wanted $12 for a board game. I told them \"How much would you pay for it at a yard sale? Thats what you should price it for\" they quickly dropped it down to $3 LOL they dont seem to realize the idea is to get rid of it, not make tons of money! My feet problems from my medicine has caused these nasty infected ingrown toenails on both my big toes. It hurts so bad! Monday my dr perscribed me an antibiotic. Hasnt helped so far, but hopefully it will... GINGER- hope you're feeling better. LIZZY- good break down on hot flashes! Looks like you've spent some time figuring it out! FELIS- glad to hear your wound it doing so well! when do you start radiation? RACHEL- your kids are so cute! WHen is your appointment (i know sometime this month) Iceland- i am jealous! I can never get the pictures right!, sometimes they wont post other times they are HUGE! That is so sweet their grandparents talk to them 2x a day! canada seems to put the right emphasis on family! (hey USA take a tip from them!) SUE- i will do a cold compress on my headaches, sometimes mine last a few days (3 at the most) but never a month long! I just ice pack it til it numbs, i use IBprofin only- the liquid gels always work fastest/best for me.  LIZZY- Yeah i'll believe that (wink) if the nuclear disaster doesnt impact the cancer rates I'll die of shock! EVERYTHING EFFECTS THE CANCER RATES! I guess they dont want a riot over there! Advice heeded. Change my avatar (although i dont plan to get back to work anytime soon- still a good idea) Love your idea of a members only site- makes sense, there are too many sickos out there that get onto these site and \"fake\" their cancers and i dont know, get off on our pain/suffering???? Why do ppl do that? Just read the Binur vs Jacobo- WOW it does NOT shock me that this happened here in TX! a friend of mine was told she had thyroid cancer after a biopsy, she had surgery to remove the thyroid, also did radiation. Had a slew of side effects because of it, but then a few years later it turned out that somehow they switched the pathology. She NEVER had cancer, and this poor other person never knew that they DID! SUE- your insurance doesnt pay for blood work???? that is the most ridiculous thing i have heard. it can prevent a lot of things if caught early enough in your blood! Well probably not hte most ridiculous thing as i have had many of fights with my company to just to get dang medicine! LIZZY- i understand the flipping out on the tube- i hate it too. it took me many scans not to have a panic attack while going through it, honestly my heart does still race. I agree should make a more friendly MRI machine! i second the margarita idea ;) OH AND I WANT TO LEAVE Y'ALL WITH JUST ONE STORY THAT SHOWS THE CORPRATE GREED WE HAVE IN AMERICA (IF NOT WORLD WIDE) so i was at a discount store asking if they have any boxes that they intend to toss out. And the manager said a few, someof them they send back to the distributor and others they crish and throw away. i said well thats smart, reusing boxes makes tons of sense. well she goes on to tell me that if there is a product that they dont sell wether it be clothing, food or what ever they have to THROW AWAY! straight into the trass. i said cant y'all donate it or let the employees keep it and she said NO they are to rip open food packages/ take a box cutter to other things/ crush or smash glassware. I was thinking- there are ALL THESE PEOPLE in not only the world but in our local community that could use food, clothes and homegoods. And here they are throwing this good stuff away!!!! She went on to tell me that she was at walmart and they were puttong clothing into large trash bags, she asked what were they doing with them and they said. THROWING THEM AWAY! are you kidding me! throwing them away?  What has become of our society where we would rather throw stuff away then give it to people that are in need????? Have a lovely day ladies, you will find me dumpster diving behind all the stores once the sun goes down!",

If just our local walmart or other store that can toss things can take them to these places all within 5 miles of eachother, it'd be a start.... But yes no managment skills whatsoever! It is super exciting! We have a home in mind, still prayerfully deciding if its the best move for us. Ginger- we had a resturant in AZ that would do that- they were a buffet and the food that was left over would get donated. I find only some ppl are reluctant to attend those things, but if the actual food/clothing bank arranged to get those extras from the stores it wouldnt put the burden on the ones recieving them...",

We are still mid move and i found a picture of my step dad (the one that passed away last yr) brought me down memory lane. I remember him buying me my own bike, not for any reason just as a surprise. I must have been 15 or so. I was ecstatic! (when i was 13 someone stole my other bike an old school Schwinn)  Rachel- Great pic! So cool your son won. (i would like to say I NEVER win things, but i actually have had some wins in those drawing type of things or calling the radio station for things LOL) My niece (the one who lives with me) is amazed that i win LOL I even won tickets to the Tejano music awards one year! that was awesome! Hope your in-laws are soon on the mend! My husbands friend just lost someone in a tragic way- His wife's best friend, whom they were visiting up in San Antonio because it was her birthday, got caught in the flash floods this morning. She lost her life. It is scary, people dont take the \"turn around, dont drown\" warning when it comes to those low crossings. But in her case, she WAS turning around but the current of the water over the bridge (small bridge over a canal) was just much and it swept her away. They mistakenly called my husband but luckily he was able to get some of his family out there to help them. If you've ever visited San Antonio you've no doubt seen the flood markers that sometimes go to ten feet tall- no joke we get a foot of rain and it all rushes to the lower areas and floods, our ground is too dry to absorb it all. Sounds weird but its like a wet string- you can pour water on it and it will travel down the string, but pour water on a dry string and it wont. Anyhow its been a terrible day. Lizzy- Wow that IS cold!  i cant complain about the temps right now! RE ACS- they helped me with a wig, but you're right they will help in the way of directing you to other places that \"may\" be able to help. I cant think of ANY place that helps cancer patients like that on a wide scale. Just localized places that will help if you live near them. Its sad because so many ppl do not get the treatment they need because they cant afford OTHER bills on top of cancer bills. Do i feel we should all get a pass because of our cancer? No but a leg up once in a while would be nice! WOW what a freakin moron! i cant believe she said it in a way that we were \"lucky\" to have gotten cancer because of all the freebies we must get! Oh please have her tell that to my children when i expire! Their mom was lucky. PPL also make me sick (so reminds me of my crazy sister in law!) Ooooh i looked into the Family reach program right now- i looked maybe last yr or so when you first mentioned it- they are EXPANDING! i am so happy for that foundation because they are able to help more and more people! They will have a partner hospital in TX in 2013 sometime. Well i gotta get this packing done! I'll check in soon! YOU LADIES ARE AN AWESOME BUNCH OF WOMEN! I TRULY APPRECIATE OUR FRIENDSHIPS!",

Okay so i had what i thought was a wonderful idea for a dinner- left over turkey from thanksgiving made into a soup with potato carrort and onions (didnt have celery and def not about to make a trip to the store today lol) I used chicken broth undiluted for the base so it was full of flavor (or so i thought) Hubby took a break from work and tried it and wasnt a fan LOL- he said it lacked flavor, just tasted like turkey water: HELLO I CANT TASTE ANYTHING!!!! so after he left i seperated it into 2 pots (just in case i messed up lol) i added more salt and OOPS sage instead of rosemary.... okay now i can taste the freakin sage- so i put it through a strainer lol rinsed off all the sage added another thing of broth (glad they were on sale cuz i bought 4 yesterday) searched high and low for my rosemary but cant find it! So i added mrs dash LOL okay i couldnt think of what the heck to add!!!! Hubby is on his way back for dinner, this is a holiday to remember!!!!

I trusted my drs judgement and here i am 2 years later they biopsied the lung and it did turn out to be cancer. In my paticular case i wasn't ill as much as in chronic pain- my orginal scans showed what my dr decribed as \"if you took a painbrush and flicked it on paper\" so i had many very small spots on my lungs. But these indeed did effect me! I couldnt even lift a gallon of milk without terrible pains, and sleeping at night was too much to bear- i would literally cry myself to sleep, before i was dx'd i went to the ER a few times and they had given me strong pain killers which would dull it but never go away. So in answer to your question- yes even small cancer spots can cause BIG problems :)",

Like others mentioned they used the results to determine their doing certian surgeries. I do believe a star recently opted for a bilatmx based on her genetic testing results even though they were maybe stage 1 or something....

But i now what you mean, the payments are so low you really cant have any debt (car or house payments) or wont be able to live on it! I think a sock monkey is WAAAAAY less dangerous than the pencils kids usually get from teachers, i've seen kids poke other kids or throw them. My read on him is that he has inferiority complex and it makes him feel like a big tough guy to pick off the weaker teachers. SO he is gunning for you simply because you're an easier target, you work with less kids than the others, you take off for doctor appointments- he is trying to guilt you into thinking he's right, but dont give this jerk the satisfaction. Run him through the ringer, i will be surprised if the district keeps him on much longer. He cant keep getting caught up in legal battles, lose and then stay employed. He is costing the district money. ",

Terri- I think I wasnt as clear as i wanted to be regarding my concerns :) thats what happens when i try to be discreet and use ages and not names LOL, my concern is for the sister that has her life together. She has an awesome job, and great family and provides stablity to her kids. This is the sister I worry about. She and I are close, talk nearly everyday, but she is totally waiting for the other shoe to drop. SHe knows there isnt a cure for what i have and isnt expecting a miracle. But to me my having cancer is like an anvil above my head, one false move and the thin string of normallacy will be cut. I dont feel i can tell her everything, because it worries her, and honestly she doesnt need extra worry in her life. If i slip something out i can hear the fear in her voice... Hmmmm Oh i knew the difference Chick- i have never been to Al-Anon, but if it is in the same style as AA i can't handle it LOL. This is coming from a girl that was put into counseling since the age of 8 til 18, i have had enough of the feel good talks from people ;) I don't think any of us are sucked in from my addict sister. But my sister (the 28 yr old that i am concered about) truly will be alone when i die... Yummm love the chocolate ones, i do not like how the white filling leaves a coating on the top of my mouth... Like a film of lard or something!",

My first oncologist talked to my kids like people, age appropriatly of course, now that they are all in school they seldom get to see my new oncologist.
