My RO didn't mention anything about shingles being a side effect. I'm happy to hear they were able to catch it early. Day 2 out of 25 is complete! My tech said that my RO might want to add on 5-7 boosts at the end, but we would decide on that in a couple of weeks. So far I haven't had any issues. I don't really expect any side effects until week 2 or 3. I'm usingEucerin 3-4 times a day and I apply aloe vera directly after my treatment. I have Aquaphor, but my tech told me to hold off on using it until my skin starts to turn pink. Sounds like all is going well for tbalding and cbowle! ðŸ˜Š",

My RO told me that my skin would continue to react for a week or two post rads, so I'm not surprised, but I'm not happy. My breast is still very red. I'm peeling like mad! It's so bad I don't even want to put on lotion. All the dead skin ends up coming off in my hands. I know, gross! I'm scared putting on lotion may make it worse. My underarm is peeling as well. It is a combination of red and purple. Very sore as well. My last day was Monday and my techs said they didn't think I looked that bad. In fact, although red, they thought my skin held up fairly well. I saw my PS on Wednesday and he didn't seem concerned either. He said it looked as he would expect it to look. I guess I'll just wait it out? Did anyone continue to use lotions and creams while peeling? LTF - I'm so happy to hear you are doing better! I'll be joining you with Tamoxifen soon! cbowle - I love the picture! I'm so glad you were able to enjoy your break from rads. How many more? tbalding - How is your skin holding up? It's great to hear how everyone is finishing up and healing!",

It sounds like your first treatment went smoothly. The moderators usually begin the new threads. I'm not sure if they plan on starting a new thread for summer rads. You should stay with us! I have found this thread to be so helpful and informative. I hope you do as well! I have 12/25 this afternoon. Almost halfway! I'm still feeling/looking pretty good. I'm slightly pink, but no discomfort or itching. I saw my plastic surgeon this morning. He said he is pleased with how well my skin is holding up. Hopefully, all will continue to go well. I hope that everyone has a great week!",

I am jealous of all the ladies that are able to cut their treatment time in half. My RO did not mention that option to me, so maybe it is not available at my center? Or maybe it has something to do with me having a mastectomy and not a lumpectomy? Whatever the reason, I'll be \"radiating\" all summer! I also have the marker and tape. Tattoos will be tomorrow. I have Eucerin and cortisone cream ready to go. I plan on picking up some aloe vera tomorrow before my appointment in the afternoon. I'm a little nervous as I will be going through radiation with tissue expanders. I have heard side effects might be a little moresevere for those of us with the expanders. Has anyone with expanders found this to be true?",

Paxton29 - Reading all the replies, I feel like I'm the odd one out. I used to moisturize everywhere! I've spent a small fortune on Bath & Body Works scented body washes and lotions. I have baskets full of them in my bathroom. However, since being diagnosed I have been using fragrance free lotions. cbowle and tbalding - We have made it through 4! Yay! I don't notice any changes with my skin or any itching. I am starting to feel sore under my arm, but I'm not sure if it is from rads or from the awkward position I am in during my treatment. I'm still using the Eucerin and aloe vera. I wear a sports bra during the day, but once I get home after treatment, I go braless. I have tissue expanders, so I don't really need the support. They are like boulders cemented to my chest! Lol! Congratulations to everyone finishing up and good luck to everyone still in progress! I hope we can end the week with minimal side effects!",

I am sorry to hear so many of you are developing painful side effects, but I see many of you have found ways to relieve some of the discomfort. I finished 10/25 today! I'm still not sure about whether I will be doing the boosts. My RO is leaving it up to me. I think if my skin is still holding up pretty well at 25 treatments, I'll go ahead with the boosts. If I'm painfuly red and peeling, I will probably skip the boosts. So far, I'm not seeing any skin changes on my breast, but my tech pointed out a small triangular pink shape on the back of my shoulder where the radiation is exiting. I didn't even notice it. I've started applying Eucerin to that area as well as my breast area. I've also noticed a general tightening in my breast. My RO said that is normal, especially with tissue expanders. I'm also starting to feel a little fatigue. Nothing that is keeping me from my normal routine, but I find myself wanting to lounge on the couch a lot. Lol! tbalding - Way to keep up with the exercise! I hope that the bandages you ordered from Amazon help with your discomfort! cbowle - Happy to hear you are stil not experiencing any major side effects!",

Hang in there! cbowle - Yes, I am still with you! Finished 15/25 on Friday. So thankful we have today off! I am pink and itchy. A bit tired and warm to the touch. It's really not that bad right now, I am just concerned about how it will progress over the next several weeks. I'll keep my fingers crossed your skill holds up for you trip to Mexico! tbalding - You are almost there! Woo hoo! Carlsoda - Yes, my pink area extends about an inch or two below my breast. In fact, I'm mostly pink and itchy around my breast, not on the breast itself. Maybe it's because I have expanders and not a lot of breast tissue under my skin to absorb the raditation? In any case, I think the irritation exdending below the breast is normal. Wishing all my American friends a very Happy 4th of July! Off to BBQ my annual hot dog, find a shady spot out by the pool and watch some fireworks! Perhaps, I may even drink a beer in my near future!",

My skin looks angry. The upper left area of my right breast and the area in between my breasts looks downright furious! My NP took a look today and said put on an old t-shirt and alternate Eucerin with the Aquaphor all weekend. She told me to up my protien intake. Arg! After going through chemo, I'm so tired of protien! Why can't they tell me to up my intake of wine and chocolate? I can totally do that! Best wishes ladies! Have a wonderful weekend!",

Quick question, did you use any sort of dressing after your Domeboro soaks? I'm going to begin tomorrow. I'd feel better having some sort of dressing as the skin is open, but I'm not sure what I would use that wouldn't irritate the surrounding skin (like adhesive). I'm thinking about you ladies!
