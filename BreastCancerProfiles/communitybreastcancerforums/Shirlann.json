That is why you are doing the best thing you can do, be your own best advocate.  Depending on the medical profession to always be right and help us is not gonna happen anymore.  Things have changed.  Watch and question everything.  We must all re-organize our thinking and expect very, very little from those who treat us. Get copies and go over all your blood work in the coming years, learn all you can so you can ask intelligent questions.  My husband is a diabetic, and he has been having terrible sugar drops at night, which are very dangerous.  I was idly looking at the Net, happened to look at his blood pressure medicine and the side effects include: \"Hypoglycemic, dangerous, blood sugar drops when this medication is taken with Metformin\".  Of course, he takes Metformin.  He has questioned his doc over and over, but he did not know.  Sheesh Gentle hugs, shirlann ",

All kidding aside, I found out about the Shingles Vaccine from the Ladies Home Journal, my doc certainly didn't tell me.  The jerk.

And to address the issue of large tumors, boy that is a possibly bogus opinion!  In Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book she acknowledges that usually we like small tumors, but she said she had seen a lot of huge, lazy cancers that are taken out and never heard from again and a fair number of little bitty ones that metastasize quickly.  So again, the big cancer fear, no one really knows what will happen, but try not to worry about that one.  Size is somewhat of an indicator, but surely not for sure.

If you don't do the chemo/rads, and metastasize, there is no cure.  You can often live a long time, but this is not a situation where you can say, \"Well, I'll try Holistic, and if it doesn't work, I will go to chemo and rads\".  Usually, this is no longer an option. The radiation \"cleans up\" the area of the original tumor.  Chemo is systemic, cleans up any cells that might have escaped the breast. I would get Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book and read only as far as you need to.  The later chapters do not apply to you and will scare you.  She is a strong woman's advocate and I liked that. So think carefully, we have had numerous women over the years try the holistic route, and most have died.  I myself am a huge user and believer of vitamins.  They told me not to take them during treatment, I was shocked, I said \"why\".  It seemed to me that my poor body needed all the help it could get.  It was explained that if you send in mainly C, E, and A, they will go after the \"free radicals\" which are:  Chemo & Rads, so they are afraid they will interfere with treatment, maybe. (no one knows this for sure) So, think carefully, if you are healthy, you should tolerate these treatments well.  I myself am 9 years post treatment and still doing just fine. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

If a tumor is large, often chemo is given first to shrink it.  In some cases you can then go on with a lumpectomy, just depends on size and whether or not you have lymph node involvement.  So this may be what you will eventually do.  But I don't like his approach or attitude and you don't have to put up with this treatment.  If it was a splinter, fine.  But this whole trip is long and nasty, and you have to have at least a working arrangment with your team.

This is sooo nice, when two groups agree.  Some women do this to more than one facility. I too kept my slides.  I KNOW where they are and I won't lose them. So ask the providers what this costs, and it should not be that much, back in 1993, when I sent mine to UCLA, it was only $125, but things are higher now. Good luck, Shirlann",

I met a lady at the dog park and she had BC in 1985, she told me she often can't remember what side it was on.  I am 9 & 1/2 years post treatment and just got back from an Amazon Cruise.  You will be just fine.

Make this decision very carefully.  Remembering that the first shot at this thing is the best.  And on the other hand, no one, I mean no one, can tell you with any certainty that you NEED chemo to survive or that you DO NOT NEED chemo to survive. All anyone has is the numbers.  If you recall, Lance Armstrong told them, \"Hit me with all you have\".  His doc/onc says now, \"He had less than a 5% chance to make it\".  Now, testicular is more responsive to treatment, and rarely recurs, so to compare him to us is truly apples and oranges. Breast cancer is notoriously fickle.  I would advise getting Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, she is an advocate for women, and has our best interests at heart. And remember, what difference will it make, if you do not do chemo or rads, have no side effects, of course, but die.  Then you will have won the battle and lost the war. Don't get so caught up in the \"what ifs?\" of treatment.  There are literally thousands of us out here that were treated and are perfectly well.  I myself am 10 years post treatment and 73 years old, and just got back from a 1300 mile trip up the Amazon. Don't lose sight of the goal, worrying about side effects that may or may not occur.  I sailed through rads without a problem, I left for a trip to the Baja to see the whales 6 days after I finished the treatments.  I worked throughout.  You often see only the bad side effects, since few of us post:  \" I had all the treatments, and I am just fine, tired of the whole thing, and shaken, but well\".  You just never see that, and no one can guarantee that, but on the other hand, no one can guarantee you will survive without the recommended treatments. So you are taking a huge risk with your life on the chance you may have side effects?  Doesn't make sense to me. But, as always, it is a free country and your decisions will be honored.  But do go see the post of the sister who is grieving with her sister over her very bad decision to go with an unproven protocol.

      "Content": "Aug 3, 2008 10:31AM - edited Aug 3, 2008 10:34AM by Shirlann Hi, what I would urge you to do is find a breast cancer specialist or breast clinic ASAP.  NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE can tell what is in a lump until that tissue is under a microscope.  Period. These people make excellent guesses, but the also make many mistakes, I was one of them.  I was told, \"Oh, this can't be breast cancer, see, your lump is smooth\".  Well, 2 years later my smooth lump was diagnosed as Medullary BC, a small sub-type, and it is characterized by smooth edges. May I ask if you are going to different docs, but in the same town? Neighborhood? Clinic?, because they will back each other up, no matter what they think, themselves.  If you must, go out of that zip code.  And don't tell your new doc that you have been to many docs, this makes them wary of you (they are afraid of pro-active women, afraid you might sue).  So it is imperative you get out of the area you are in, and at first at least, don't talk much about your outrage, this scares them to death, and they will push you off so they don't have to deal with a \"difficult\" patient. This sounds awful, but after 7 years on this site, I have heard everything.  So you need to advocate yourself for yourself.  Do not be pushed off. Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

In Europe, the situation is not exactly the same, but most docs are on a salary and don't make money from treatments. I am not disagreeing with you about the money mongers, we have had them, and we still do, but it just was not my case. I think what we have is a \"set protocol\" for each parameter.  So, no matter what, they do what the protocol says.  Even if it is silly, makes no sense, or is actually harmful.  This way they protect their rear ends and don't get sued as often.  I had a very small tumor, no nodes, and I wish that I had said no to rads, but we are so intimidated. I have no heart or lung issues 9 years later, but I have bone pain from either osteonecrosis (dead bone) or bone softening. So what I TRIED to do, and what I would now INSIST be done, is, get a lead apron and put it under your breast and over your abdomen.  I asked, but they said, \"Oh, nothing gets anywhere except the breast\".  Just not true.  So anyone who is contemplating this, MAKE them give you an apron, it sure is no skin off their nose.

They do not need you at this point, just your slides, mammo's and records. Your english is excellent, so you can get this book in english, or, with luck in Italian.  But it will help you along this journey. This works, of course, only after surgery and it sounds like surgery has not happened.  So I would get Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, and read only as far as you need to.  Take a small tape recorder with you so you don't have to remember everything.  Come back often and post, you are now in a club with many, many women, and you are a welcome sister.

One way to get a second opinion easily, is to collect your wife's original slides, her original mammo's and copies of her records.  (This, of course, would be after surgery), then call Sloan-Kettering, Dana Farber, Brigham & Women's, John's Hopkins, and ask them how much for a new pathology report.  Then, FedEx everything to them and they will return it all with a re-done pathology report (from one of the best cancer centers in the world) and recommend treatment, if everybody agrees, you are good to go. This runs around $500, although be sure and ask.  It is money well spent, they don't need her, and the cost of that, just the infor as I outlined.  If you want more info, just PM me.  (just click on my name and a new page will come up and you can send me a private message). By the way, I have never seen a path report that did not say the cancer is \"aggressive\", scares us all half silly, but cancer is \"aggressive\".  Sheesh, he just probably doesn't want to fool with any other ideas, but 95% of the time, both pathologists agree, this is for you, not him.

Try to stay calm, you haven't done anything that dozens of women haven't also done.  I don't think you have cancer, and you think this way until someone tells you otherwise. Of course you are worried, having had one cancer.  But this still does not have a lot to do with anything.  There are so many variables in all women, everything under the sun (actually, including the sun) that can be a culprit, after a while, you just say, what is done, is done, you can't undone it. I am 9 years past treatment and doing fine.  In the very odd case you do have anything, it is not the end of the world, as you certainly know. So try really hard to stop your mind from squirreling around and driving you nuts. Come here and be sure and let us know what happens, I am sure it will be a big fat (\"Get outta here!)

I hope most of you have considered anti-depressants.  They were a life-saver for me.  I have always had depression problems, so I was especially susceptible, but what a God send! They are not addictive, although you need to get off them slooowly if you decide to do that.  They are not on the substance abuse list the government prints and they do not make you sleepy, or dopey.

Needle Biopsy:  Here, you are given usually a local like a dentist does, and they stick a needle in and take out a small amount of tissue to put under the microscope. Excisional Biopsy:  This is what I had, they take you in the operating room, I just had local shots, and then they cut out the whole thing they think they see.  Mine was 7mm, so it was not much of a cut, and I was awake and chatting through the whole thing, no big deal, I waited around for an hour in a room and then went out to lunch with my hubby.  Now, some docs/surgeons want this done under a general anesthetic, where you are completely out.  This depends on the surgeon's preference, how deep, large or difficult the surgery might be.  So several things enter into the picture.  Your preference might be one of them.  Before I had this type of biopsy, they did a sonar with me sitting up and stuck a very thin needle into the area, checked that it was in the right place, and taped a cup over it and my husband drove me to the out-patient clinic nearby. There are very few nerves in the breast compared to other parts of the body.  And since you don't eat, digest, pee, poop, walk, talk or use the breast in any way, there is not much pain for most of us.  Of course, some people have very different experiences.

Size does matter.  But it is only one of about a dozen things.  There are lots of women with big, old, lazy tumors that are taken out and never heard from again. And, some gals have pin sized tumors that metastasis quickly.  So there are a lot of things that go into this, just one of which is size. And you are not even diagnosed.  So as best you can, forget this, 80% of these \"thingys\" are nothing.  That is a huge number. Hugs, Shirlann ",

I had a lumpectomy and I am totally satisfied with this decision.  I was a Triple Negative also.  I am 10 years post treatment and would not change a thing. So unless you have very tiny breasts or a very, very large tumor, I don't know why you would need reconstruction? Another interesting fact that no one truly understands, in Europe 70% of women (who are eligible) have lumpectomies.  In the US, this percentage is reversed.  The recurrence and met incidence are identical if you do radiation.  Also, it is impossible to completely remove all the breast tissue in a mast anyway.  You do get a couple of percentage points of advantage, not much, but you can recur in a mast scar, in the chest wall, etc.  So I am a little puzzled that so many women in the US have masts?  I surely understand the multi-focal issues, and the many cysts issues and the very, very dense breasts issues.  But if none of these things are you, I think you are doing the best thing.  And yes, you can always have a mast later.  Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

Occasionally, a lymph node will get infected because of some other infection in the body.  The lymph system is designed to filter out \"thingys\" that might make us sick, and this is what is probably happening, although sometimes they just swell up.  But with another thing going on in your breast, it could be a number of things, most all of them benign. Yes, you can feel a lymph node if it is swollen.  If you think back, when you go into the docs for a flu or a cold, they will often run their hands over your neck, as these nodes are easy to feel, and often tell them that , yes, you do have an infection. But try not to worry, all will be revealed in a short time.  I wish you the best of luck. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

I am 10 years post treatment and am finally seeing an improvement in my rib.  This was a very odd thing, but not many have this rib pain last so long. I found that I could work (desk job), then go for my zap at 4pm, then go right home and veg till bed time.  This worked for me.  The one night I went out for dinner with friends I was completely ruined the next day.  I was 63 and had no children at home.  So this doesn't work for women with little ones.

This can hit you early or late, some of us never have it at all.  Depends on your body and general helath too. I was helped greatly by 1000mg of Vitamin C daily, with a good B Complex, Fish Oil and Calcium. I don't know if any of this really helps, it is impossible to tell, but sure can't hurt to try and get your energy back. (DO NOT start this vitamin therapy until AFTER treatment is over) I know that for some of us it is the whole thing.  Basically a year of fear, panic, pain and feeling ill.  This causes a form of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.  Just like the vets.  So give yourselves and your poor bodies a break and rest all you can and build up your bodies with good, fresh food, lots of water and plenty of rest. Gentle hugs, Shirlann  (Getting close to 11 years post treatment)  ",

Here's hoping that is what you have and this will be resolved quickly.  Kudos to you for getting an appointment with a dermatologiest, with HMO's here in California, it is almost impossible.

This tends to be difficult for docs to know quite where to start, as you are finding out. Of course, I am not a doctor, but I have been around these boards for a long time and I think most of the girls would agree, never heard of leg lumps associated with breast cancer. This sounds like something is bothering your lymph nodes, so the docs need to find out what this is. Lymph nodes, as you probably well know, are there to stop or prevent \"things\" from moving on to other areas in your body. They are often associated with infection somewhere, but just as often with auto-immune diseases. I don't think you could normally notice lymph nodes unless they are enlarged, hard or hurting. If I were you, and I could, I would go to a major center, like Mayo Clinic, and get a complete \"work up\". Probably your own doc can do this too, if going out of town is not an option. You need a full-on blood panel, urinalysis, etc. Just a really complete physical. So many things affect the lymph system, it really does take a doctor to even begin to find out what is causing your problems. Could you have breast cancer? Yes, you could, and that would be part of a complete physical. You can also have more than one thing going on. This makes diagnosis difficult. I would just keep pursuing these symptoms and not just give up. If your current doctor seems uninterested, go elsewhere. But keep pushing until you are satisfied. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

So at little cost (about $500) and without any more trauma for your daughter, you can get a second opinion.  I would most certainly do this.  I would have been treated for the wrong cancer if I had not gone to UCLA (or sent my slides, I should say). I guess my experience makes me not as trusting of ANY pathology report.  If you send those slides to a world class cancer center, where the pathologist does NOTHING but breast slides, you can be confident that your diagnosis for Hannah is correct.

Take a small tape recorder with you, ask permission, then tape all the meetings.  They give you so much info, and you can't even remember where you parked your car. I liked Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book.  Some of the gals did not like it as it is very specific.  But if you just read as far as you need to, not the later chapters, I think it is great. In my small bible study class, there were about 25 of us, as I tearfully told them I had breast cancer, 3 ladies piped up.  One was 22 years post double mast, one 17 years post treatment and one 11 years post treatment.  They are all still fine, so you can add 9 years to those numbers.  I met a lady at the dog park who had just retired from teaching, she had BC in 1985 and told me she often forgets which side it was on. So do not get too sad.  This is very doable and you will get your life back.  90% of us will be old cranky ladies.  So don't get too down. Gentle hugs, Shirlann    ",

If the facility where you are going puh-puhs you, go elsewhere. Do not be detered in your search, and unfortunately, you will ALWAYS have to be persistent. If caught early, and a pro-active plan will pretty much insure this, you have every reason to expect to recover completely. If indeed, you ever have BC.

At this stage, your mom has every reason to expect to fully recover.  This will just be a nasty bump in the road.  Tell her to take a small tape recorder with her to the meetings, they throw so much at you all at once it can get confusing. But try not to go bonkers.  90% of us get well and continue on with our lives.  Your mom will too.  I am 9 years post treatment and doing fine.  I am 72, now.

This is your body, the only one you have, so stop feeling like you are annoying them or that you are a hypochondriac.  You are a concerned consumer, paying for this service, and you are not a charity case. Now, with that settled.  MRI's are often a very good tool in helping diagnose what is going on. Do not pay any attention to Lay people's opinions.  It is true that breast cancer usually does not hurt.  But sometimes it does.  Your age is a factor, but we have had women as young as 22 with breast cancer.  Your age makes it less likely, but not for sure.  And so, just smile, and continue until YOU are satisfied with answers. Be assured the only way that a diagnosis is for positive sure, is when the actual tissue is under a microscope.  All the other stuff is just good pointers, that's all.  Mammograms alone are about 70% accurate.  MRI's show cancer, but they also show every other thing that lights up. So again, this is a wonderful, helpful tool, but not a given answer.  So I would suggest that you continue to be persistent, do not cry, or act hysterical, just be firm, and insist that you get the answers you want.  If the people you are dealing with push you off with half or vague conclusions.  Go elsewhere.  Some of our women have gone to more than one facility.  This is just what many of us had to do.  I went to UCLA, not happy with the conclusions I got with my local bunch of bozos.  I loved UCLA, I could not believe the professionalism.  What a night and day difference in competence, care of the patient, the pathologist at UCLA did nothing but breast cancers and I was satisfied with the results.   Remember, this is your body, your life and you only get one.  If the providers are pooh poohing you, politely go elsewhere.  This is not a game. Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

Things can surely go wrong with the other breast, but that usually is discovered in the normal scheme of things with your annual mammogram. I, since I am in an HMO, did not have any MRI's or any other tests, once my breast cancer treatment was over. This is not necessarily a good thing, but it is common to concentrate on just the one breast. I understand your fear, it remains with us all. And if you have the type of insurance or plan that would allow an MRI of both breasts, and this would give you peace of mind, by all means ask for this. But again, they typically treat the other breast that has not had any problems quite differently than they treat the one that does have a problem. But it sure never hurts to ask.

So there is no point in him seeing you, really, unless he has x-ray vision, he will depend on his radiology reports to help you.  This is not uncommon. One thought, I am sure, at your age, that you just have what you describe, an infection, this can be from a hair follicle, or any number of things.  One exception is IBC, which is so rare, I hate to worry you with it, but it is Inflammatory Breast Cancer.  It is not detectable with a mammogram or ultrasound, only with a biopsy. I tell you this, not to scare you silly, but just so you have this question to ask him, and if this thing does not clear up in a reasonable time, which it most likely will, you will know a little bit about this very unusual breast cancer.

I kinda am worried about an odd sub-type of breast cancer that is very rare, so I hope I am not scaring you, I don't want to do that, but you need to be aware of Inflammatory Breast Cancer.  Why?  Well, it is rare, it does NOT show up on either a mammo or an UltraSound, it can be diagnosed ONLY with a biopsy.  I am sure this is not what you have, but I would go to a breast center, if you can, and be sure to bring up this type, many docs/oncs have never even seen this. I surely do not want to scare you half to death over nothing, but I don't like the way they are treating you and I don't like the family history AT ALL. At the very least you should be seen frequently, and by all means have the BRCA gene test done.  So please forgive me, I probably shouldn't have even mentioned this type of BC, and obviously, this is not what was wrong 8 years ago.  So with a little luck, nothing serious is wrong this time either. I am beginning to blather. Gentle hugs, Shirlann PS:  You are not too young to have breast cancer, although it is much rarer at your age, but in my mind, your family history overrides your age.",

Well, we sure don't know.  And it is silly to waste any time on a horse that has left the barn.  But I wonder if anyone has done any studies?   We can't get caught up in the \"what ifs?\" and our sweet babies are sure worth the world, but one does wonder. I, myself am a strong believer in genetics, not that it does any good to feel that way, since so far, they don't have much to fix that with, but my husband's dad smoked 3 packs a day from the age of 12 till he died at 86.  Not one symptom of even emphysema, let alone lung cancer.  No cancer in his family, either.  But that theory has a ways to go.

If it is just a recurrence, that is not too bad, it can be re-treated, but if you metastasize (the BC moves to your liver, bones, brain or lungs) you are NOT curable.  Now, many of these women live a long, long time, but they will eventually die of breast cancer, in this case, a few months of misery seem like a pretty good trade.  Just be sure you understand your first shot at this is the best one.

If you think your household would be in a mess if you treat your cancer, how in the heck could they handle you sick for two years and then dead? Think, girl, think.  If you are active in your church or any club, ask for help with an evening meal.  Most people like you are very, very independent, but toss that aside, and admit to one and all that you have to have some help.  Line up everyone. Tackle this as you would a tornado, or a flood, would you just fall over in the water and drown, leaving a group of wonderful kids without a mom, just because you were busy?  NO, OF COURSE NOT! Breast cancer is something that is no fun, but in many cases, it is not that bad either.  I had a lumpectomy, radiation and worked through the whole thing (admitedly, no where near as hard as you work), I was 63 that was 9 years ago and I am fine.  I am so glad I didn't ignore this cancer, I just got back from the Amazon.  Life is full of such wonderful things, you can't be serious that because you are busy you don't have time to treat something as treatable as this? So get with it girl, you are obviously the type who will take this in stride and just add it to the long, long list. I don't know you yet, but just from reading your post, I don't want you to go prematurely. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

I got the same stupid run around, a lot of us do.  I was told it was nothing for two years, then when they finally decided it WAS something it took them 3 months to get to the biopsy, and they thought it was Lymphoma.  I went to UCLA.  Thoroughly disgusted. But that was 9 & 1/2 years ago and I am fine today.  You have every reason to expect your wife will grow old with you, 90% of us recover and go on with our lives. I like Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, just for you.  It will explain so much.  Don't read the later chapters, you won't need them and they are depressing.  Also, I took a small tape recorder since my husband and I were so upset we ended up arguing over what was said and this recorder solved that problem. This is not an easy journey, it is so long a lot of women end up with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.  But truly, especially with no nodes positive, your wife should be just fine.  Almost all the women I started out there with are long gone on with their lives. But please post often, someone can answer just about anything, and we have a few resident wizards.  Like Beesie, Beth, and Leaf, women who truly have done their homework. You whine away, that is just what you get to do here.  Tear out your hair, cyber style, since we don't know you too well yet.  When we get to love you as we always do our newbies, then you have to be careful!  Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

(Not to say you shouldn't go elsewhere)  Did you know the difference between surgeons and God?   .............God KNOWS he's not a surgeon!  Now, you are not in the mood for silly jokes, but what he suggested is pretty much what most suggest at your stage with one node.  However, as the sisters have already told you, you can go elsewhere, for sure, to someone with a better bedside manner. My bunch of jokers had me wait 2 years, because, in the words of another jack-ass surgeon, \"If it was a cancer (referring to my obvious lump) it would be spikey\".  Fast-forward two years, now it really shows up.  I had test after test (everything but a biopsy) and nothing showed up.  Finally, finally, finally, they did a biopsy and they thought I had Lymphoma.  They sent my slides to White Plains, NY and I had an odd sub-type of BC called Medullary, which is characterized by \"smooth edges\".  I was so mad, I was furious, bunch of idiots. So I got my original mammo's (the one with the lump was \"missing\") and my slides and went to UCLA.  They agreed with everything, so I went back and got treatment.  That was 9 & 1/2 years ago.  I am fine. Please don't feel alone.  If we had all the nitwit medical personnel in a line, it would stretch to the moon.  But do remember that speed (in most cases, not all) is not that important.  Most breast cancers, by the time you can find them by any means are 8 to 12 years old, so it is not unreasonable to either get a good 2nd opinion or change surgeons.

There are not a lot of places who do \"all\" the things you will need.  Usually you have a GP who sends you to a mammo place, who sends you to a surgeon, and then so on.  But there are some.  Cancer Centers of America is the one I have heard about, and of course, the world famous ones like Sloan-Kettering, Dana Farber, etc.  And then there are Breast Specialist Centers.  If you have that available, that is great. So happy you found us.  Sorry you had to, but again, you are in fine shape to make a full and uneventful recovery.  You will need to be super vigilant in the future, but still, no danger of mortality. The \"lump\" is no doubt fluid.  You may need to go back to your surgeon's office and have this aspirated.  No big deal, but the build-up is normal and quite painful.  Some of us have drains that hang out of the incision, that can be emptied.  Just your surgeons decision. So most of us just move to one discipline to another.  There are not many places where it is all in one place.  At least not here in San Diego. Sorry you had to join us, very happy with your diagnosis, so come and post often and other gals will be along soon with ideas. Gentle hugs, SHirlann ",

I like WeightWatchers.  They have a very flexible program and allow you to eat at all the fast food places, (carefully chosen items, of course) and also restaurants.  Applebee's has a special WeightWatchers menu. So I am a little leery of running, especially with boobs bouncing around (you can get a runner's camo) and it is so exhausting, the chances of staying with an excercise program are better if it is not so painful. Jacquio, is sooo correct.  I remember the old Nike ads, \"We can do, but you have to take the first step\", or something like that. Good luck, Shirlann ",

People have found, by accident, that the Anti-Depressive, Effexor, helps some women a lot with menopausal symptoms.  So this might be worth a try. I take vitamins:  Believe me, no magic bullet here, but remember, your immune system, your mental health and your poor body have taken a huge hit.  And it might need some help getting back to more normal. I take, have taken for many, many years:  1000mg of C, a very good B Complex, Co-Enzyme 10, 1000units of D, folic Acid, Fish oil, and a bunch of stuff that may or not have any use.  Green Tea capsules, Cranberry capsules, Grapeseed capsules, a multiple for the trace elements (they do not contain enough of the C, B or D to do any good. So, I have a little box, for me and my husband and I fill it once a week and just chug these down.  I have never had fatigue (but, of course, who knows why?) and I hardly ever get colds, any opportunistic little infections. So while this is surely not a cure, it can't hurt and might help.  At least you feel that you are doing something to get back to normal.

One thing I hope everyone knows is that while there are many reasons for a mast, multi-focal disease, different things in the breast, DCIS plus IDC, etc., big tumor, small breast, etc., etc.  NEVER having to worry about breast cancer in that breast is not one of the reasons.  You can have a recurrence in the chest wall, the scar, etc.  Breast tissue is up your arm, under your arm, etc.  Can't all be removed.  So while a mast is often very, very necessary, never having to worry about that breast is not true, a mast just gives you a slight edge over lumpectomy.

This is a newer test that is not as invasive as an axillary dissection (translation, they just grab a hunk of flesh under your arm, send it to pathology, and the pathologist digs around and dissects some lymph nodes. The sentinel, obviously, is much less invasive. Of course, ideally, we would all like to be treated at Sloan-Kettering in New York, or Johns Hopkins. Also Dana Farber, Brigham & Womens, Mayo, there are a lot of super-duper cancer centers. M.D. Anderson in Houston too. But if that is not reasonable, you can find a surgeon you trust, have the surgery and the lymph node test and then, get the original slides, original mammo's and copies of your records and send all of this to one of the major cancer centers. Usually you need to call first, find out the cost and the address and then with a written authorization, collect all these things and mail them off. All but MD Anderson (they don't do outside work anymore) will re-do the pathology and send you a new report with treatment recommendations. If this agrees with your local docs/oncs/surgeons, then you can confidently carry on. Of course, if you have the funds, I would go to a world renowned cancer center at once. The advantage is that often the cancer centers have a pathologist or even a whole department devoted to just your cancer (breast, prostate, etc.) instead of a pathologist who maybe 10% of his work is breast cancers, and of course, every other thing that comes down the road. Just makes sense that a doc specializing in your cancer is better informed, is up on the latest treatment, etc. Good luck, and keep posting, Shirlann",

But this is humanity.  I finally realized that NOTHING anyone could say made me feel better.  NOTHING.  I was mad at all of them, at God, at the world, it was not a good time for me, I hope your experiences are much better. But after a while, I found this site, realized I could talk about anything and that has been enough for me to forgive all the people who could not be expected to know what you are going through, unless they had \"walked the walk\", which they had not. So come here, we all understand, you are a sister and we will be with you every step of the way. Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

I want to welcome you to this board and hope and pray your stay will be very short.  With your family history, you are very wise to be super vigilant.  You might want to see a geneticist, there are several genes that can help you with decisions on whether to be super aggressive in finding out things.  One is the BRCA gene.   You are quite young, and that is in your favor.  AND 80% of these \"thingys\" are benign, that also is a big number and one you need to hug while this nightmare wait goes on.  Every one of us had this (always over a weekend), and it is torture.  The next thing you need to know is that about 80 to 85% of us recover completely and are just fine.  So even if this is cancer, you are very likely to have a rocky few months, for sure, but a full recovery is not only possible, but very likely. I am 9 & 1/2 years post treatment and fine.  There are literally thousands of us out here, nobody says much, but people who have been through this and gone on to have a great life are way in the majority.

It is so hard to wait, wait, wait for all the procedures required to give you a final picture of exactly what you have and a clear idea of what you need to do, so try not to worry about each thing until you get all the information. We have all been right where you are, and you are in a large sisterhood of friends.  Remember, about 80% of us do very well, I am just beginning my 12th year after treatment.  So post often, you are always welcome!

You do have some percentage points advantage. However, it is impossible to get \"ALL\" the breast tissue out, and you can have a recurrence in the chest wall or in the scar. Breast tissue extends up the front of your breast/chest and under your arm, you cannot get it all removed. So not to be a negative voice, just be sure you are well informed. Dr. Susan Love in her Breast Book, says that she almost prefers a lumpectomy (when this is the right choice, and there are plenty of very good reasons for masts) because with a recurrence, she has tissue to work with instead of trying to dig into the chest wall. With your non-invasive type, I think a double mast would be big time overkill. Especially with the time that has gone by since your diagnosis. But, as always with this thing, you must make the choice. (I just love it, the one time we really need good medical advice/opinions and they tell us WE need to decide). Last time I checked I didn't have a medical degree! But I sure understand what you are saying, and as always, it is your decision. Hugs, Shirlann",

Don't worry about the time, it is fine.  I was tested for 3 months before they got a diagnosis, and usually, that old thinking about speed is not generally valid anymore.  Not to say some types of BC they do need to be quick, but most of them, speed is not important, whithin reason.  You are NOT a baby, this whole thing scared the beejesus out of every single one of us.  We were all terrified.  Ask you doc for one prescription of Zanax, or Valium or something to use the night before to sleep and during the test in the morning.  Then you will have something to take until you get the test results.  This is a long drawn out terrifying ordeal.  But you have every reason to believe it is benign, as 80% of these \"thingys\" are benign.

Besides, the MRI you already had would have lit up like a neon light if there was cancer anywhere else in your body, so in effect, you had the best test possible. He feels you have been diagnosed early enough not to worry about this.  And if it has spread, you will know it soon enough.  I know that not all the women agree with this approach, but since with metastasis (not to confused with recurrence) there is no cure, so what's the rush to find this out? Again, trust me, this is a very individual issue.  And depending on you and your personal feelings, you can generally get this testing done if you want.  Your doc feels it is so remote a possiblity that it is not worth it.  I agree with him. So don't feel bad about feeling bad.  This whole journey is a frickin' nightmare, it was for all of us and what he knows, and you need to hang onto, is about 80% of us recover completely.  That is a big number.  I don't mean to minimize the journey, or the terror, or the lingering fear we all have, but I am 10 years post treatment and fine.  I met a lady at the dog park who had BC in 1985, and she told me she often forgets which side it was on.  Women just don't talk about it.  In my small bible class, as I blubberingly told them \"I have breast cancer!\", 3 women (in a group of about 20) piped up, \"Me too\".  I was shocked.  One was 22 years post double mast, one was 17 years post treatment, and the other one 11 years post treatment.  We are all still doing just fine, 10 years later. This is very scary, but come and post often, rant and rave and cry.  We all did.  You are in a huge sisterhood, just remember, most of us come out in one piece. Every headache is never a headache, it is brain mets, no back or bone pain (which I have all the time) is never just getting older, it is mets.  This thinking gets a lot better as time goes by.

No one knows for positively certain what is what until that lump is in a jar and the tissue is under a microscope. They have a lot of tools and they are an enormous help, but the proof of the pudding is the biopsy. As you can see, most of us here are BC gals, so we are unusually pro-active.

What I find unconscionable about this sort of thing is they got tons of data from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so why do it all over again?  Grant money?  I am getting cynical.

These things will affect any decisions you make. All anyone can do is put themselves in your shoes. If I were you, and I had my family complete, I would get rid of everything. I am in an HMO, and we cannot \"ask\" for oophectomy, just for prophylactic reasons, but I wish my ovaries and uterus were gone. I read in one book years ago (so I don't know if this info is true) that we have 4 times the risk of Ovarian Cancer because we have had breast cancer. This is just my own personal opinion, I don't have any medical training. So as usual, you will need to read, read, read. Listen and put all the info together to decide for yourself what you want to have done. Don't feel a particular rush, you need to recover from one thing before you go on to another, to give your body a chance to recoup and not fall victim to some nasty germ waiting to pounce on compromised immune systems.

They keep your appetite up, so you don't get all skinny like Lindsay Lohan, and you feel better. If you don't take them, I think some of the gals started out not taking them, you won't feel as good. So I would give it a try. You can always stop. Have you had a bad experience with them before? We all know that long term steroid use is not good, but this short sprint will not harm you long term. But if you are dead set against them, of course you do not have to take them. This is not Russia. Now radiation, I just sailed through that. I had my zap at 3pm, after work, went home and did NOTHING. Of course, I was 63, others have little ones or jobs that are more demanding than mine was. I did not burn (I know I was lucky there) and I left for a trip down the Baja to see the whales 6 days after I finished. Others, not so lucky. But no matter what happens with rads, it is not 1/10th as bad as chemo. So try not to waste a lot of time worrying about that. One day at a time, baby steps. I was kinda like you, Barb, I did not cry, I think with my dad's horrible family of cancer relatives, I kinda knew it was coming somewhere. When people talk about life-altering events. This is one. I, of course, instead of moving to africa to help the people, began a retail therapy course and I am still paying off my credit cards! I don't advise that! I thought I was dying and someone else would pay them NOT!!!! It is a big change, but that too begins to fade as you move back into your normal routine. I was very busy right then, so I just kinda got lucky, a lot depends I think on what else is happening in your life. You are a sweetheart and a kick-in-the-pants, I can tell, I wish you were nearby. Anywhere near San Diego? I would love to meet you. Hugs and kisses, Shirlann",

The thing is, all the gals I started with were mostly younger, I am now 72, and they have gone back to their families and jobs and lives. I am retired and I love this site so much for all the comfort and info I got when I needed it, I stick around. I have a small bible class, about 25 of us, when I weepingly told them I had BC, 3 women piped up.  THREE out of 25.  One was 22 years post double mast, one was 17 years post treatment and one 11 years out.  I was stunned.  You can add 9 years to all these numbers, these gals are still in my bible class and doing just fine. I met a gal at the dog park and she told me she had BC in 1985 and sometimes forgets which side it was on. This is no fun.  It is a hard, long journey, I don't mean to make light of it at all.  Some women have horrible experiences, some not so bad, and some not too bad at all.  One never knows.  But what I do know is I have about 20 women who I have known for years, that I met on this site and they are all fine and well. You will be too. Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

I like Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, if you read the later chapters, it can be scary, so just stay where you are in treatment.  Don't delve farther, you don't need to read things that will not happen to you. And I took a small tape recorder with me and didn't have to take notes or remember, they throw a lot of info at you and you don't even remember where you parked your car! Oh, today, on the evening news, they said we could cut cancer in HALF if we ate less fat, so there, you are on the right track. Anyway, it is sad you had to come here, but we love you and you are a sister to us.  So post often and tell us what is happening. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

Sounds a little strange that they can't tell the difference, they tell the difference all the time.  Are you at a large facility?  I would definitely get those slides somewhere else before you decide what to do.  You are right, the quality of life issue is huge, and losing a partial lung with other health issues seems extreme.   So definitely get a second opinion, one way or the other.

To get the original slides and mammo's, sometimes they will send them on for you, but I prefer to call the facility, ask what they need (legally, just a signed authorization) and if you have a fax, they can fax the forms to you for your mom to sign, then go in and get them yourself.  There are services in large cities that will do this for you, but of course, this is expensive. So this is how it is done, they do not need to see your mom, necessarily, so the cost is so much less.  I only paid $125, but that was almost 10 years ago, now, it is more like $500, but it is still a lot cheaper than airfare, hotels, etc. PM me if you need any more info.  Oh, I kept all my stuff myself, even though I promised to return it, I know I won't lose any of it, in case I need it at some later time.

I started with a large group of women, kinda like we all do.  They have all moved on, they were younger with jobs and families.  So when you read the threads, just know that there are literally thousands of women out there who have been through treatment and are just fine. Don't get me wrong.  We were all scared half silly.  It is a long, ugly process, seems like slow motion sometimes.  A lot of the women use anti-depressives during this time and then slowly get off them when you get your confidence in your body back and get back on your feet.  It is a shock, it was to all of us. I also took a small tape recorder with me to all the appts. and procedures, then I didn't have to try and remember all the stuff they throw at you.  My mind was not doing too well in the first place and here I was, expected to take this all in, digest it, and make sense of it and try to make decisions. Sounds like you have done a very good job of this.  Your decision do a hyster is a good one.  I had a lumpectomy and radiation.  It went very well for me, I did not burn.  Some girls do, it is hard to predict.  Fumi, our dear sister from Japan, lived all alone, kept working and did chemo.  So did our Sue, from Wales, she is a Subway Manager with two boys at home.  She often worked 10 to 12 hour days.  So this is all doable.  Some people, as you will read, have hard times, some don't have a lot of trouble.  But just remember, not too many post.\"I had treatment, it wasn't too bad, and now I am fine\".  But this is a common experience.  So stay off the net, except for here, of course, where your sisters will always help you and you can yell and cry, and rage all you want, we know just how you feel.  Unlike the people you tell who have not walked this walk. So you should do very well, expect this, Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

It does not work that way, usually.  It takes time.  So do your best to take one day at a time, one step at a time.  This can still have an acceptable outcome.  About 80% of us get well, and that is a big number. Anger is perfectly okay on this site.  I can top your sister's response, I told my ONLY sibling, and she said and I quote, \"Well, that is what you get for having all those mammograms!\".  Then I didn't hear from her for weeks.  Now, I sure felt beloved.  Some of our women, their siblings quit their jobs to care for them, people run around for them, I had just my wonderful husband, so I sure do understand all the pain,  Honey, you have been handed TOO DAMN MUCH for any one person to deal with. But  your back is not cancer and your bladder is not cancer.  But trust me, we all thought this about every ache and pain, in fact, my back hurts right now! So keep posting, we will help you all we can, and I really don't want to tell you this, but usually, you have to wait for the pathology report a week or so, to stage the cancer, check the lymph nodes, and on and on and on. This is no fun, but you are a sister now, and you are in our club, and we are very close to our sisters.  We will always be here for you. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

Now, you don't know yet, so don't jump to any conclusions.  Wait and see.  Things may be not so bad.  My sister constantly has \"scary results\" from lung/chest x-rays and all it is is old bronchitis scars from her youth.  So try to stay calm until you know more. So the story is, when the breast cancer speads to other organs, it is still breast cancer, but it has spread.  So this is the part that is confusing you.  Versus two separate cancers.  They can tell this under a microscope. If they think they might be able to cure her with a lung lobe removal, then that might be the way to go.  If it is just a delaying action, you need to know that, too.  this is assuming the lung thing is anything at all.  I would get Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, just so you can stay ahead on the \"lingo\".  It is so confusing at first.  Also, I took a small tape recorder with me so I did not have to take notes or try to remember. Let's hope that all this is something benign.  Stay at that point until you know more. Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

If and believe me, this is a very big if, you do have cancer, you can most likely safely have it out locally, it is not rocket science, the big concern, is clean margins.  Then, get your original slides, your mammograms, and call Sloan-Kettering, Dana Farber, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, any one of the really big, famous cancer centers.  Ask them how much and an address to send your stuff to, and they will do a new pathology report and a recommendation for treatment.  It is usually around $500.  Then, Fed-Ex the whole lot to them and you will have the best pathologist in the world doing your slides.  They will send you a new pathology report and a new recommendation for treatment, if this all agress with your local people, you are good to go. this is jumping WAAAY ahead, but I want to ease your mind about being in a small community. I sent my things to UCLA, and when they agreed with my local team, I was at ease.  So almost certainly you won't need this info, still, it is good to know you are not out of reach of the best medical care for cancer in the world, while living on your lovely island.

So keep on checking, then start a class action suit, if you can find the perpetrators.  The hard part, of course, is getting any info on who was responsible when it could have been years ago.  But not necessarily, so well worth the effort to check. You might need to find out where your water comes from.  This is not the only source of contaminents, for sure, but the easiest one to track.  You can also take your tap water and have it independently analyzed at a lab, checking specifically for carcinogens, then work backwards to see who \"dumped\" whatever is found (if anything, it could be the air, the dirt, etc.). Good luck, dear friend, Shirlann ",

They are not too concerned because I think they feel you are too young to have anything very serious.  This may be true, but you need to be aware of a very unusual breast cancer called Inflammatory Breast Cancer.  It presents with wierd symptoms and cannot be diagnosed, only with a biopsy.  It would be one in a million if this is what you have, partly because of the time frame.  You have been trying to get help with this for ages, and I think IBC would be giving you a lot more trouble. However, leaving no stone unturned, even an unlikely one, I think you need to get a biopsy.  I don't like the nipple inverting.  This is another major symptom. As I said, the chances that this is IBC are remote.  But many doctors have never even seen it, so if you don't bring this up, and get someone to check you for this, nothing will be done.  In any case, you have the right to get whatever this is diagnosed.  It is not normal, it is not likely an infection because of the anti-biotic use with no results.  They need to look harder and you need to push them.  I would take this page of responses with you.  And Google IBC, too.  Then you can say to them, I want to be checked for this. They are just hoping you will go away, we have the same problem here. Keep posting, let us know what happens. Gentle hugs, Shirlann  ",

You can get a recurrence in the chest wall, or in the scar, etc. It is impossible to completely remove all the breast tissue on anyone, it runs up your arm in the front and on the side of the breast. So the decision to do a double mast should be made for the right reasons. One reason, multi-focal breast cancer, or, lumps in several places in the breast, or gals with extremely dense breasts for whom mammos are not a great screening tool. Strong family history of BC. Lumps in both breasts. There is a slight percentage advantage to a double mast and you often avoid radiation. And that is sure a good thing. So I am not opposed to a double mast, just do your research and be sure you understand everything. Gentle hugs, Shirlann Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

It also helps to know other than the nipple/aerola area, breasts do not have many nerves.  My tech was doing the needle thingy and I was sitting in the sonar spot, and he just said, \"Oh heck, I am just going for it\".  Did not hurt at all.  He taped a paper cup over the needle and my hubby drove me to the out-patient clinic.  Had a lot of fun with that place, I did not want any blood, of any kind, and kinda made them mad.  So they grudgingly put a \"no blood\" strap on my wrist.  Then, I kid you not, they gave me a paper to sign that was permission for them to do a blood test if there was an accidental stick. (HIV, I think).  I thought this was funny, so I said, \"Well, I don't want your blood and it appears you don't want mine!\".  I thought it was hilarious, but they just grumbled. Then I walked into the operating room, laid down on the \"bed\", no place for my arms, I was glad when they pulled out two boards and my arms went there.  It took the surgeon only about 3 Novacaine sticks, he was done in 30 minutes, I got up, walked to the sorta recovery area and after about an hour, went out to lunch with my hubby.  For me, it was nothing.  I have had many worse experiences in a dentist's office.  So we are all very different, and our cancers, of course are different, in different places, different sizes, etc.  But this is not a bad surgery.  Remember you don't need to pee, poop, eat or walk with your breast.  The underarm thingy was a lot worse.

You are kinda thinking 1935 times.  Back then, things were very different.  Today, with the newer treatments, 90% of us will recover.  So stop the plans for your eulogy and answer your phone. You are not going to die.  A very few of us die.  It is a long, hard, nasty journey, but on this site we have women who will help you every inch of the way. I have never met such kind, well informed, lovely women that will leap to your aid and answer questions and let you scream and yell all you want.  This is a venting forum, in a way.  You can be yourself with your sisters. You have not been diagnosed, but it seems you might be.  But come back here and let us know what your path report says, and in a couple of hours you will have women with the exact same diagnosis on here to help you, explain, and by the way, most of them are doing very well. I don't mean to sound mean, but you will get well, you will not die, you will make friends that will fill your life with comfort and that is assuming the news is BC. Gentle hugs, Shirlann    ",

Well, they sent my slides to White Plains, NY to a specialist and I had Medullary BC, which is a small sub-type.  By now, I am an OLD WOMAN, and I started out young,  haha.  Sheesh, I was so mad by then, as soon as my lumpectomy and radiation were over, I got out of that health plan, pronto!  It seems to me you are moving along at lightening speed, compared to my snail pace.  haha On a couple of Internet sites they have bras with one side \"ready-made\"  also bathing suits with one side \"ready made\".  This might be something you could think about.  Anyway, love, keep us posted.

I am a Triple Negative, that means your breast cancer is not estrogen nor progesterone driven, hence the PR-/ER-, then the Her2neu, is also negative, and that is a good thing. What it means is that we don't benefit from Tamoxifen or Femara, newer drugs that are a real wonder for ER and PR positive gals, they don't do us much good.  BUT on the bright side, and who knows why, we have more aggressive tumors, recurrence, metastasis, but after 2 or 3 years, our recurrence rate almost drops to nothing, while the \"normal\" gals gradually taper off.  AAACKK, too much info sometimes. But I so admire your strength and courage, your faith and all the faith and love of the women on this thread.  I just wanted to stick in my little bit of info.  (PS:  I am 9 years post treatment) Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

Husbands are usually pretty helpless.  They are the protectors of the family, since caveman days, and they cannot \"fix\" this problem.  Some get mean, some get dismissive, \"Oh you'll be fine\".  It is hard for them because they are responsible (not really, but this is their mind set).

I would go back to her gyno, explain the problem, and get another recommendation there.  Frequently, if this is a simple biopsy, it is an out-patient procedure, anyway, and no hospital is usually involved.  There are several types of biopsys.  Just depends.  You are definitely on the right track, if you can get to a breast surgeon, that is way better.  Good luck.

Most breast cancers, when large enough to be found by any means, are 8 to 10 years old.  So even if this is something, (and it most likely isn't) this time to check yourself out is no problem. My breasts also point at the floor, I have had 3 children and lost and gained weight like mad for years, and both of mine look at the floor too.  I think the weight gain, then losing it is key for this, in any case, to my knowledge, this \"pointing direction\" has absolutely nothing to do with BC. One of the big issues is family history, so if your mom is around, or aunts, check and see if anybody has had breast cancer, since they will ask you this at your appt. STOP WORRYING, it would be very unlikely if this is anything at all.  Some of our women have been going in for look-sees of lumps for years and years.  Some women just grow them, we don't know why. Come back and let us know what you hear, and I bet it is good news. Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

This ER/PR negative just means we don't usually take Tamoxifen. Way back when I was diagnosed, I was glad. But no one knew much about Triple Negs back then. Think of it this way, there are 20 arrows in your quiver to fight this thing, only one is missing, I bet you will never even miss it. The GOOD NEWS is, we have a slightly more aggressive cancer, but if we get by 2 to 3 years, our recurrence rate drops to almost nothing. While the other types just continue on a normal downward trip. So that is great. Now, the hard part, holding your breath for 2 years. Nawwww, just kidding. Since 90% of us recover, Triple Negs and all, you have an excellent chance of being completely back to normal, most of us are or will be.

Hardly any pain for me (others, of course, have different experiences) because there are very few nerves in the breast.   Some surgeons prefer a general anesthetic, that, of course, is their choice.  But when he is done, you will have a complete pathology report to see and the \"thingy\" will be GONE.  That is great, I wish my group had done this in the first place. Most breast cancers, not all, but most, have been in our bodies for 8 to 12 years.  So the time is not an issue.  If he is going to do the node look see at the same time, you are really lucky, you only have to screw up your courage once.  Mine took about 6 procedures to get where you will be in only one procedure. So hang in there, you are not being filled with cancer (we all thought this) and you will most likely be just fine, and get your life back.  I am 10 years post treatment and just got back from a trip 1300 miles up the Amazon.  LIfe is good again.  Around 80% of us recover fully and are well.  A lot better statistics than heart patient diagnosis.

I did this at UCLA, back then, 9 years ago, it was only $125.  But who knows now?  Anyway, they don't need you, just your stuff. If this new report from a pathologist who usually does nothing but breast slides, agrees with the one you got originally, you are good to go.  If there is a difference of opinion, then you need to deal with that.  Either send your stuff someplace else, or change docs/oncs. It really is quite easy. If you want more info, just PM me. Hugs, Shirlann  ",

God does not guarantee no problems, just the peace of his presence in our lives to enable us to deal with it. But don't feel bad about doubting, as one of our posters said, I don't think there is a single one of us who has not doubted. I remember one Sunday at Mass our dear priest grabbed the sides of the lectern, leaned over and said, \"I have doubts too. I don't have all the answers. I am just like you all, on a journey, that has good days and bad days. But God will see us through, with his son Jesus, we can do it\" I have never forgotten those words. And I often question, this is fine, God does not expect no questions, that is human, and he gave us free will, so there will always be questions. This is okay and does not mean you are bad, a disbeliever, evil, or anything like that. This just means you are human. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

Cancer NORMALLY does not spread like that.  With some few exceptions, of course.  It is typical for a year or two to go by, with treatment finished, then something might happen.  I am surely not a doctor or an oncologist.  So this is just conjecture and what I have observed on this board, but I would not worry about this delay.

And don't assume you will have a miserable time, even if you do get BC. (Boy, that is reaching for it), but I had a small cancer, went into an out-patient clinic, had it off with novocaine, then went home.  Can't even find the scar.  Then, I had radiation.  I worked through the whole thing.  6 days after I finished rads I went on a strenuous trip to Baja to see the whales.  I was 63, that was 10 years ago. I don't mean to sound like a Pollyanna, or presume that things would be the same for you.  But detection early is the key to an easier time with this.  And the BRCA gene test would give you a lot of information. So while this whole rigamarole is never any picnic, many of us have a lot easier time of it than some do.  The problem is, most \"easy\" cases, no one writes about.  That is one reason I stick around.  This is not the end of the world or the end of you.  With two sisters, you need to be vigilant, and I would gather all the info you can, and then stop worrying. This is not easy, but you can do this.  Just make up your mind that cancer (or the possiblity of it) will NOT rule your life. Just so you know that this is very survivable and very doable, if this is even necessary.  I have a sister who is 75 and won't even get a mammogram.  Dumb, if you ask me.  But this is her choice.  I personally would rather be on top and in control. So this is a decision you will have to make, but whatever you decide to do, you will not necessarily get breast cancer in any case. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

BUT, now I have some pain still and the concensus is osteo-necrosis, or in english, dead bone.  They had a few ideas of how to treat it, but I don't really want any more anything and I am 73 and can do what I need to do so I decided, no more x-rays or surgery, and they don't know if it would help. Aren't even sure of the diagnosis. So very few people get this, and it does come on about 3 to 6 weeks AFTER finishing rads.  One way Dr. Love says to sorta diagnose it is to squeeze the area, pinch the skin, and if it hurts, it is Costochondritis.  I have truly never run into but one other woman who had long term problems like mine, so you should be fine after a time.

Oh, I have a pemanent sore spot, I don't know what it is.  It has been suggested that it is osteo-necrosis, or dead bone.  Lovely thought.  But I am almost 10 years post treatment, I don't want anything else done, just glad to be alive.  But, as always, get it checked by a doc.  Hugs, Shirlann  PS:  Oh, it comes on a while AFTER rads are finished. ",

Just be sure you and your providers know that IBC cannot be diagnosed without a biopsy, mammo's and ultrasounds show nothing. But your are very young for this.  If you have little or no family history.   Nevertheless, if you are worried and things don't improve pretty fast, go to a breast clinic, or at least a breast surgeon, most regular docs have never even seen this rare type of BC.

As far as Tamoxifen, it is not genetic testing, it is testing to see if your wife's cancer is estrogen or progesteron driven.  This would show up on the pathology as ER, or PR + or -.  Some doctors like to give this drug (or its newer sister) whether you show up positive or not.  It is a drug that binds the estrogen to the drug and does not let it cause cancer as easily.  It is a good thing, but I am certain that it is available and used in Canada,  The only genetic testing I know of is for the BRCA Gene, and there is no medicine for that, it just indicates a double mast and possibly a hysterectomy is maybe a good idea. If I were you, I would get Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book and read it.  She is an advocate for women and what she tells you is very straight forward and easy to understand. They pushed me off with the \"wait and see\" too.  For 2 years.  Then, when something did show up, they thought I had Lymphoma, they then had to send my slides to White Plains, New York because no one here knew what I had, then in utter disgust, I went to UCLA.  I had a sub-type of breast cancer called Medullary, doesn't mean anything, but they did not know what it was. The only reason for an MRI, and it is done for some, is to see if the cancer has left the breast area and moved to other organs.  I sure didn't get one, and it was money constraints here, too, without any symptoms, they just don't do them here unless you are rich. It is very easy to get completely disgusted with health care here or in Canada.  I was furious.  But you are definitely doing the right thing, taking charge and learning on your own what is up. Get Dr. Love's book, so you will know so much more.  My husband and I wore one out and had to buy a second one.   Don't hesitate to come back with any questions or concerns.  We have some women on here that I swear are better than the oncologists.

So, you must press on and get an answer that not only makes sense, but is correct.  Your age is one reason they are so vague, since breast cancer is rare is such young women.  But trust me, it surely is not impossible.  It happens.  And you don't want to go undiagnosed until some jackass decides to take you seriously. You need to stay calm, they do not like us to be hysterical or mean.  Just don't give up.  I think a round of antibiotics was an excellent idea, since infection is a very good guess at this point.   However, if you can get an MRI, that is a better test than a mammo, which is only about 70% accurate and less accurate on young women with dense breasts.  So the 3 week wait is miserable, but if this is what it is, you can surely try to get it pushed up, like, ask them to call you if they get a cancellation.  This is a good call. Most of the time, pain is not a BC symptom.  But not always.  Some women do have pain.  This thing is so variable, almost nothing can be said for positive.  There is a very rare (highly unlikely) breast cancer called IBC, or, Inflammatory Breast Cancer, which can only be caught with a biopsy.  Most docs have never seen it.  And it presents with a rash, or tiny pimples, or an inverted nipple, itching, etc.  I don't want to scare you, but you need to know about this, just to remind them to be aware of this unusual type. Come back any time you get worried or have something happen or just to talk.  This site is full of kind, gentle, helpful women who will be with you till you leave with an \"all clear\", or stay with BC.  So come often, and be sure to let us know how things go.

Most of these gals do just fine. Remember, the lymph node system is throughout our bodies. Their job is to stop nasty things, cancer, infection, etc., from moving on to other places. So your lymph nodes were doing their job. Period. Try not to read any more in this than that. As far as life changing forever, no, it hasn't. Believe it or not, you will get back your old life and your old happy outlook, it just takes a long time. Most of us suffer some form of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, so keep that in mind. I always suggest that newbies get a drug, Ativan, valium, or something like that for appointment days and treatment days. And for nights when you wake up at 3am and the squirrels of worry are running around the bedroom. Helps a great deal. And you need your sleep. So hang on, dear sisters, almost all of us will be just fine. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

Men are wonderful, but clueless.  Not their fault.  This is completely something they know nothing about.   But definitely something needs to be done and it looks like it involves surgery.  There are not a lot of nerves in the breast and you do not eat, drink, walk, talk, pee, poop or laugh with your breasts.  This is not too bad a place for surgery.  And generally, it goes quite well, with little pain and quick healing. So I would go with what she suggests.  Sounds like excellent advice to me. We have had many women nurse from only one breast, this is easily done, if you have more children. This part of the whole journey will drive a saint crazy.  We all hated it, but good for you to pursue this, and not just let it slide, that is the easy thing to do. Your goal is to remain well.  Second goal, to look nice, but believe me, waaay second.  So ask her all these things and even get a plastic surgeon involved.  They can usually fix about anything, and the law in most states is they HAVE to return you to your original \"look\" as best as possible. We are all with you, and you have an 80% chance this is nothing but a troublesome milk duct. Gentle hugs, Shirlann   ",

Absolutely you need to tell her. This is awkward, to say the least, but if you had a testicular lump, and she felt it, and didn't say anything, what would you think? So hard as this is, especially if your relationship is relatively new, you must tell her and urge her to do something about this lump. You are very special, Shirlann",

In any case, good luck with the lumpectomy, mine was nothing.  I know not all the lumpectomies are the same, but I walked in, hoped up on the table, they numbed me with novocaine, took it out in about 10 minutes, sewed me back up, I waited about an hour in the out-patient recovery room, and went out to lunch with my husband.  Very few nerves in your breast, so there is little pain, for MOST of us.  As always, if your lump is very large, or deep, all bets are off.  But mine was truly nothing.  If it wasn't for the seriousness of the whole thing, I would rather do this than go to the dentist.  Remember, you don't poop, pee, eat, walk, laugh or sit on your breast, it is a very good place to have surgery. I will go find Beesie for you. Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

I chatted throught the whole thing, waited in a little room for an hour and went out to lunch with my hubby. It was really nothing, my tumor was small. Now, if the area they want to get at is deep, or in a difficult spot, sometimes they need to do a general anesthetic. But I am like you, I HATE generals, so try for the local. Unless the area is difficult, or deep, you should be able to go to work the next day, I did. So it kinda depends on how much work they do. I don't think it would be a good idea to try to go to work with a general, they make me too sick. Be sure and let us know how things come out. Hugs, Shirlann",

You need to go to a breast specialist, to have the BRCA test done, if you have not already done this. Mammograms are a huge blessing, but their error rate, especially in younger women with dense breasts, is around 30%, so there goes that comfort.   Get thee to a breast specialist, if this is at all possible, they are soooo much better at this than regular doctors.  You will be amazed. It is most likely nothing, but they pushed me off (my own fault) for 2 years because the surgeon said, \"Oh it is not cancer, the lump is smooth, see?, and cancer lumps are spikey\".  Well, when I finally got diagnosed I had a small sub-type of breast cancer called Medullary, which is characterized by \"smooth edges\".  I would not stop here with your family history.

Don't be to upset by the delay, most BC's when large enough to be found by any means, are 8 to 12 years old, so time to heal the breast is reasonable.  Kudos to all of you to pursue this until you are completely satisfied with the answers.

Dr. Susan Love in her book talks about an asian woman who came in with her two sons.  She examined the woman, found a huge tumor, explained all the options and diagnoses with the two boys, and was amazed that they relayed this info to the mom with just a few words in their language. Jump ahead, Dr. Love states she did not expect the woman to make it through with this large tumor and lymph node involvement, but treatment was done and they all left. 10 years later, here comes all three of them, mom and two sons, the mom smiling and well.  She truly felt that they told her practically nothing and that this helped her.  Just a cute story, but true. My oncologist is a very young man and I went to see him when I first started this journey.  I went several months later and saw a tiny newborn picture on his desk.  I asked him, \"Is this little one yours?\"  He said, \"Yes, (then he sat down), he went on, \"that birth was the worst thing I have ever been through in my life\".  I had to laugh, and I told him, \"You know too much\".  He agreed.

Remember, however, double masts will definitely improve her outcome, especially with dense breasts, but it is impossible to remove every last breast cell, it goes up her arm and under a ways too.  But you will eliminate the dense tissue issue.   You are at one of the best facilities in the world at Johns Hopkins, so that is excellent. Gentle hugs, Shirlann Oh, I see she is 44, so act aggressively.  Your first shot at this is the best one. ",

I know this is hard.  We all hated this \"in-between\" area.  Once you get a firm diagnosis, and then a plan, you will begin to get your arms around this thing.  But what they are proposing is exactly what is commonly done in your situation.  The thinking behind the mast vs the lumpectomy, is that if there are two that they have identified, there may be more in there they don't see.  Does not mean there is or that it is extra dangerous.  Has no impact on your survival stats.  It is just another rock in this nasty, rocky, road.

I would sort've agree with the \"wait and see\" except for the family history.  With this in mind, keep pushing until you get better answers.  I don't like the lump near your chest wall, they are harder to treat and keep track of.  The ONLY way to be sure of what is in these lumps, after they pass the cyst test with ultra-sound, is the actual tissue under a microscope.  You will get resistance, but you need to emphasize the family history and if possible, get genetic testing to rule out the BRCA gene. Again, most younger women and some older women have dense breasts.  Well, the medical profession has to deal with that.  Just throwing up ones hands because they are frustrated just won't do. So while you are young and probably have nothing to worry about, keep after this until you are satisfied that you have been properly assessed. Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

With most breast cancers, they are 8 to 10 years old before they can be found at all.  So this delay will most likely not harm you, just drive you nuts.  There are exceptions to this, of course, but generally, this is why they are not rushing around for you.  They used to do this, but studies have shown that this is not necessary. Ask the onc/surgeon/doc for some Ativan or Valium to tide you over the sleepless nights and the days of treatments.  They are a life saver.  If you seem to have a serious problem (I did, I am an anxiety/depressive) ask for an anti-depressant.  Many of us take them.  After a year or so, when you get your confidence back, you can slooowly get off them.  They are not addictive, but you musn't stop them abruptly.   By all means, calmly tell your sons.  And use the word cancer.  Only because they are like little antennas, they overhear phone conversations, they imagine things are much worse than they are and it makes life easier for you.  Tell them you will cry now and then, but you will get well.  This journey is so long, the normal process of \"shielding\" them from the truth just won't work, the treatment takes too long. If you are truly concerned, then either insist on a nearer date, or change providers.  You can get all your mammo's and slides and take them to another place.  Nothing but your insurance ties you to one place.  So if this is going to be a horrible issue, then move on. Keep posting and let us know how you are doing.  This site is marvelous.  We have women who I swear, know more than the docs, especially about the practical side of this journey. 80% of us recover completely, this is most likely you too.  So don't get too frantic.  I am almost 10 years post treatment and doing fine.

Get yourself as fast as you can to a breast clinic and pray you are not too late.  Do what they advise, THEN go with all your natural methods which have many benefits, unfortunately curing cancer is not one of them.

Now, if you want the best and easiest 2nd or 3rd opinion, this is what you do.  She has the mast or lumpectomy.  Then she has the lymph node study, either Sentinel Node (checking the first node) or removal of a group of nodes, whichever, all this tissue will be sent to a pathologist and she will get a report, or her doc/onc/surgeon will.  (She needs to start a file, beginning with a copy of this report). Now, when this work is all done, contact Sloan-Kettering, Dana Farber, Mayo Clinic, UCLA, any number or super-duper cancer centers.  Ask them what the charge is to re-do the slides and give a diagnosis.  They will tell you.  Ask where to send it.  Then, you collect the original mammograms, the original slides, and copies of her records and forward the whole thing Fed-Ex to the hospital you choose.  This is the best 2nd opinion you can get.  It is usually pretty reasonable.  They don't need your mom.  If the new stuff agrees with the old stuff, and the reports are the same, as well as the treatment recommendations, you are probably good to go with the original group.  If things differ, send the stuff to another GOOD cancer center. There is no mad rush.  Most breast cancers, when large enough to be found by any means, are 8 to 12 years old.  So several weeks of careful thinking with good info is very reasonable.  I would immediately buy Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, I wore mine out.  Read only as far as you need to, the later chapters are scary and you won't need them. I took a small tape recorder to all the meetings.  You are under (your mom) such a lot of strain and fear, it is hard to remember, and they throw a whole lot of stuff at you.  This way, you can re-play the tape and be sure you know what they suggest. This is a long, drawn out journey.  But your mom will survive.  In the old days, breast cancer was almost untreatable, but today, most of us will live to be very old.  So stop being depressed.  Think of this as your thesis.  A long journey, but most likely good news at the end and a war story for the whole family in years to come. Post often, we will help all we can, I am 9 & 1/2 years post treatment and just fine.  Most of the women I met here when I was first diagnosed are just fine too, we stay in touch. I am now 72, I was 63 when diagnosed.  I only had a lumpectomy and radiation and I worked through the whole thing.  So don't collapse, you will be fine.  Come back often with any questions, we have wonderful women and a few husbands and sons who will help you all we can.

      "Content": "Jul 6, 2008 06:46PM - edited Jul 6, 2008 06:52PM by Shirlann Hi Charmed, well, one thing you can stop worrying about, they will NEVER do a general anesthetic without you not eating after 12 midnight, so unless they told you to not eat, you can forget the general.  They might do another test, but all the others either need no anesthetic, or just a local, like a tooth job.  So stop worrying about that one thing. I had a stereotactic, it was not bad at all, but they missed my cancer.  So while they very often work very well, this test did not work on me. As far as having your friend with you for everything, obviously, he/she can't be with you for any x-ray tests, since even the techs leave, and for me at least, and I am married 55 years, I would rather flip my boobies out with just another woman there, not my hubby (I am not too proud of my body).  But my hubby always takes me and waits in whatever place they put him.  Never hurts to ask, but some of the rooms are rather tiny, and that can be an issue.  As far as being able to know exactly what is happening, this could be what is going on.  They do a diagnostic mammo, and see something or not.  If they do, they often send you to ultrasound, and if that is telling them your \"thingy\" is a cyst, In my case, that would have been the end of it.  Since my Ultrasound showed solid, I went on to another test.  This could be why no one can tell you exactly what is going to happen is because one thing depends on the other.  Good luck, gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

This s not real easy, but don't get caught up in too much gloom and doom.  You should do just fine.  Most of us do.  All the women I started out with are moving on with their lives, seldom post and are my dear friends. You don't get a lot of:  \"I had breast cancer, was treated, and am just fine\".  No one posts that.  But it is very often true, just not too interesting.  I met a lady at the dog park she had BC in 1985 and told me she often forgets which side it was on!  So I don't mean to minimize this, it is scary, but just think, President Ford's wife had it and Happy Rockefeller had it (she was the Veep's wife)(way back in the 70's)  both men are not dead, the women are fine.  Nancy Reagan had it, he is gone, she is fine.  Shirley Temple had it many years ago, Sheryl Crowe, Melissa Etheridge, Edie Falco, Dorothy Hamill (our Olympic skater, so much for staying in shape) and so many others who are long, long time survivors, it boggles the mind. Oh and the cute little aussie singer who did the musical with John Travolta, dang, her name escapes me. Keep posting, someone is always around and you have joined a super sisterhood!

But don't let fear dominate your life.  Half the women probably have something in their breasts to worry about, but they don't because they weren't smart as your were to have things checked.  So just forget it, put it on the calendar, as you would a pap smear, go do the checks until they say \"all clear\", to go back to once a year.   Then congratulate yourself on being a very smart, intelligent person. However, if you are going to worry, then see the surgeon.  Nothing wrong with that.  Just another level of looking.   Gentle hugs, Shirlann  ",

You can have the tumor removed and just do the hormone pills, or, have the tumor removed and just do the radiation.  There is no one forcing you to do anything.  It is always your choice. But to not even find out if you can live another 10 or 15 years, with minimal treatment, if foolish. By the way, this is a very ugly, nasty way to die, nothing like the movies, where they sigh, lay back on the pillows, and go to sleep. I don't mean to be cruel, but I remember as a child, people spoke of breast cancer in whispers, it was so awful.  NOT SO TODAY! So do go for your checks, find out what it up, listen to the recommendations, then do whatever you are comfortable with Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

Stage one is marvelous. At some point they probably will check your lymph nodes and of course, you will get the results of the pathology report. Ask for a copy, and start a small file. Also, I took a small tape recorder with me to the meetings and did not have to take notes. I liked Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, just read as far as you need to, the later chapters are scary, and you won't need them. Unless things have changed (and they do change) if you have no positive nodes, you may not have to have chemo, I did not. My cancer was 7mm and I had no positive nodes, so I had a lumpectomy and radiation, worked through the whole thing. You will be fine. 90% of us recover and go on with our lives. I am 9 years post treatment and doing fine. So try not to get to upset, come here and post often, this is where you will get the support and comfort you need. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

Most breast cancers are in us for from 8 to 12 years before they can be detected by any means.  So don't feel that this just popped up.  What happened is it just got big, very fast.  Obviously, the first biopsy missed the spot.  And there are occasions where things do go this fast.  But it is no one's fault. Neither hers, or the providers.  A month ago would not have made much difference in this sad outcome. Now, please know that many women live for quite some time with metastases.  They will treat her with chemo and with radiation.  Remember Lance Armstrong, had testicular cancer, with mets to the lung and brain.  He underwent very heavy duty chemo and is alive today, 11 years later.  Now breast cancer is nastier than testicular, so a cure is unlikely, but she could well live several years.   Remember Elizabeth Edwards.  She is still here and running her house and doing okay, despite having a diagnosis of metastasis.  So hope is still with you. Down lower, there is a thread for recurrence and metastases.  You might want to look there, Many wonderful women who have dealt with the same issues your sister will have post there, and they have wonderful advice and help.  However, you are welcome anyplace on this site. I am so sorry, gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

Then tell him you and dad are worried, but you KNOW you will be just fine. Tell him don't be scared if he sees you crying or without hair, or whatever, that as a family, you will get through this and be fine. Tell him everyone has to help, he needs to feed the dog, help fold the clothes, take out the trash, that together, you are strong. The reason for using the word, is he will hear it. And he needs to hear it first from you, not from eavesdropping on a phone conversation. Those little ears are antennas. Some of the younger women have told their children's teachers. Not that they want them to say much, just so they are aware of what is going on at home. Now to happier thoughts. 90% of us will be just fine. I am 9 years post treatment and have many friends that are further past treatment than that. Chances are excellent you will make a full recovery. My favorite story was several years ago a woman had the \"family talk\", and after she and her husband finished, they told the kids when things were normal again, they would all go to Disneyland, their littlest one ran out on the front porch and shouted to all the neighbors, \"My mom has cancer and we are going to Disneyland!\". They just broke up laughing. My mom's best friend just died at 94, 44 years post double mastectomy. And my mom died of a stroke 12 years ago. We all felt so sorry for Frances. I met a lady at the dog park who also has had breast cancer and it was in 1985. She said she sometimes forgets which side it was on. I don't mean to make light of this disease. It is hard, long and at times, nasty. But most of us will survive and live to be old ladies. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

So, get thee post haste to a breast clinic.  Demand a biopsy.  I don't know where they get off with this \"wait and see\".  The sooner you get a specialist involved, the better.

Also, occasionally, the cancer is just a thickening of the skin.  I am sorry about the hematoma, just one of the \"fun\" things that can happen.  But no worries, they will drain it or it will be absorbed on it's own.

Remember, you do not pee, poop, eat, laugh, walk, talk or sit with your breast.  So it is usually not a problem to have things done to it.  There are always exceptions, some women go through hell, for various reasons, but most of us get by quite well. If you are going to fret, ask for fret medicine.  Ativan, Valium, take one the day of any procedure or even appointment, and this will help a great deal.

If it ever happened, it would be way down the road, and will most likely never happen. I would get Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, I don't think ILC is rare, I had Medullary breast cancer, which only 5% of the breast cancers are this type. (clumsy sentence, sorry). But that doesn't mean much. With Dr. Love's Book, just read as far as you need to, the later chapters you will never use and they will just scare you. Take a small tape recorder so you don't have to take notes. If all your scans and other tests came out good, then forget Mets. That is what mets are, cancer that has gone elsewhere. I presume, with multi-focal cancer, you will have a mastectomy? Sounds right, then chemo and radiation. You probably will have hormone therapy, because you are ER+ & PR +, this is a good thing, but happens later, when all the other treatment is over. But in any case, this is waaay down the road, don't worry about this part now. This stupid disease is done in stages, which drives us all to drink. Slowly they move through the series of tests, treatment options are discussed, and you slowly go nuts. But when the whole picture becomes clear, all of it makes a lot more sense. Sounds to me like you have a good diagnostic team. Many of your worries they will answer eventually. Just have to play the waiting game and see what turns up. I am 9 years post treatment, am ER and PR Negative, am doing fine and almost went crazy with the slow, step by step \"dance\" that breast cancer requires. Do remember that MOST, not all, but MOST breast cancers when large enough to be found by any means are 8 to 12 years old. So a panicky rush is not the way to go. So what part of the recommendations so far are you reconsidering? I am just curious. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

It probably is nothing, but you need to push ahead and have a qualified (hopefully breast specialist) see this. That is really reaching for trouble, but I would feel remiss if I didn't mention this very remote possiblity, so you can ask about it. Don't ever listen to techs when it comes to recommended treatment. Go when you feel you need to or when a licensed doc tells you to. While you don't want to fixate on things and drive yourself crazy with unecessary worries, you know your body better than anyone. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

Remember, you can easily get all the preliminary work, i.e., biopsies, removals, and then, before treatment, contact Sloan-Kettering, Dana Farber, MAYO, UCLA, ask about cost, pack up your original slides, mammos and copies of your records, Fed-Ex the whole lot and get a new pathology report and treatment recommendation for not a lot of money. I did this at UCLA, because here at Sharp they thought I had Lymphoma, I was really scared.  Then, they sent my slides to White Plains, NY, and I had a small sub-type of breast cancer called Medullary.  NO ONE in this town, apparently, knew this.  I was not too impressed. So insurance often dictates what we can or cannot do, but you can always send your stuff off, and that is relatively cheap and you can get the best pathologists in the world, who do only breast cancers.  Some women do this more than once, if the diagnosis is unusual, as mine was. Oh, I did run into a really super oncologist in La Jolla, if you can go to him.  He is Dr. Millard.  He is the top of the field in San Diego.  If you have a PPO, this would work, but you can always call and ask the office what they will accept.

I have had this and it comes on sometimes several weeks after treatment ends, scaring you even sillier.   Certainly some women do have heart and lung damage, but this is truly quite rare. Oh, rad/oncs DENY everything.  I think they are trained that way.  They even told everyone that the slight form of radiation sickness most of us get (fatigue) did not exist.  HA, I was around for Nagasaki and Hiroshima, I know better.

Radiologists, as a rule, do not give diagnosis, much less treatment opinions.  But who knows, different areas.  If you have a general practitioner you trust, then you start there.  I am sure your radiologist sends the reports to someone?  This person will recommend the other members of your team.  Then, you will usually see the surgeon next and an oncologist pretty much in that order.  I bought a cheap tape recorder and recorded all the visits so I did not have to take notes at the numerous appts. and I did not have to try and remember. Oh, you sound quite intelligent, so I would get Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, to help with the terminology, etc.  It is very readable. This is just a guess, but I would think they would want to do a skin saving mastectomy, because the \"thingys\" are so multi-focal, or, in english, in more than one place.  But this is just a guess. I don't know what the TE-2 is, but more women will come along soon, and we have some that are real whizses with all the terms.  I am almost 10 years post treatment, so I don't have the latest info.  I am even forgetting what I had.  I have no idea how I got the ilalics, but bear with me.     So come often and post, we are always around.  You will be fine, gee, it feels so good to say that to someone!

The reason you need to say, \"cancer\", is he will hear it.  Trust me, you won't know he is listening to a phone conversation, you may cry, people will look worried.  This will scare him much worse than the honest truth, age appropriate, of course. They are little antennas, and this cancer thing is long.  Too long to keep it a secret. We had one family that sat their kids down and told them kinda what I suggested.  One of the little ones ran out on the porch and shouted to the whole neighborhood, \"My mom has breast cancer and we are going to Disneyland!\".  She was embarrased, but they had to laugh. Keeping this important an event a secret is next to impossible.  Betweeen relatives, phone calls, appointments, surgeries, etc., he will know and imagine awful things.  Be honest, it is best.

Having said that, if you are still worried, go back to the doc, he is the one with all the knowledge and experience that we do not have. Now, several of us have had such strange goings on. Sometimes you are just listening more closely to the things your body does, and worrying about each and every one. Also, if you are thinking about your breast, you may be holding your body or spine, (you would not know this) in a strange way and actually causing aches and pains.

So you need to do just what you are doing.  Get on it and get a good answer.  People with this kind of history should also have a genetic test done for the BRCA gene.  This is just to be sure you don't have this.   We are all very pro-active, and believe in pushing for a good answer.  Some of us because we were shoved off by some docs.  So don't settle for \"wait 6 months\" junk.

You wait till you get your surgery and then get copies of your pathology report and your original slides,original mammograms,  and send them all to the facility you choose.  Call them first to check price, addreses, etc. You will get a new pathology report and a treatment recommendation. You can do this to 2 or 3 more places, if you have disagreement on diagnosis or treatment.  I did this with UCLA and they agreed with my group, so I was comfortable going ahead.  But you can't really do anything until the surgery is done and the lymph nodes are checked. I would take a small tape recorder with you to each meeting, they tell you so much it is hard to write and listen.  Also, I like Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, easy to understand. Ask for Ativan or Valium, if you don't have anything like this, and take one the days of appts. or treatments.  It eases the raveled sleeve of care...... Post often, someone is always around, Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

Yesterday, Sue, on Ellen DeGeneres' show she had on Hugh Laurie, we have all fallen in love with him over here, and he is a Brit.  But absolutely NO accent on the show, but he spoke his normal voice with her.  And they compared words.  The first one he came up with was \"chin wag\", and thanks to precious Sue, I KNEW what it was!  I was ecstatic, then Ellen came up with a few words supposedly, US slang, and I had never heard of ANY of them.  I think she cheated. Anyway, sweetie, hope you are chugging along.  This will be over soon.  Soon, soon, soon,  Almost through the poppy field. EAR ACHES, one of lifes most painful things.  Only time I had a baby that wouldn't stop crying.  And she also, obviously, has middle ear issues with this infection, so she has trouble walking.  Bummer.  You are such a good mom.  God bless you. I got on a 5 hour flight to Hawaii once, I had pants but just a little stringy top.  (Back in my thinner days).  It was FREEZING on this plane and I almost died of frostbite, never took another flight without sox and a jacket.  Hard lesson.

So ask and then set the dang pill by the bed with a glass of water and when you wake up, take it.  Well, that works with Valium, with Ambien, I think you take it at bed time, you don't want to sleep til noon.  Melody, I just went in with my hubby who was having chest pains ( he is a veteran of 4 angioplasties and I don't know how many angiograms) and it was like Bangladesh in there.  I went home.  He was okay, but he has \"unstable Angina\" and that means we never know for sure.  So if something feels different, he has no choice but to be checked out. Dear Ulla, I think trying to break up the dose is a great plan to try.    Keep pestering them, there has to be some way.  I think there is even another drug?  That does the same thing as Tamoxifen, and you might tolerate the newer one better.  I am drawing a blank but one of the other gals might know it's name.  Arimidex?  I am not sure.  But it came out later and might work better for you. I think our Sue has taken to the mattresses.  She has these bad days about now.  God bless her! Judie!  WOW!!  What great pix!  I can edit and make a disc, but nothing as wonderful as you are doing.  Those pix are really something.  My last favorite books:  \"Marley and Me\", \"A Rip In Heaven\", and \"Into Thin Air\", also I have read about 7 books by former polygamist women, they were all good.  Kinda sorry for them, it is hard when your beliefs demand so much misery. Oh Anne, how glorius.  I just love to sing, I have a 3 note range, if that.  Grrrrr Love you all of you, Shirlann  ",

I think the very worst thing about this dang bootface is the unknown.  But for both of you, you should do just fine.  But, sadly, time will let you know this, and we humans are very impatient.  Since all our lives, most things are either black or white, we are not used to \"Uh well, uh uh, who knows?\"  What kind of a frickin' answer is that? So just take it one day at a time, baby steps.  Try not to spend too much time in the future, give your bodies time to heal.  And for heaven's sake, Sue, of course your chemo did its job!  You know that.  It is just natural for you to want a positive, for sure, no maybe's answer.  So I recommend serious drugs.  Lots of Ativan, valium, (not while driving or working around sharp things, ahem, Sue babe!!! When you get so down, just come here and see all the women who are okay. I had a nice surprise today, our local California Pizza Kitchen, a middle of the road, but nice, restaurant gave out little sealed folders last time we were there.  So, today, we went back, and the trick is, YOU cannot open them to see what the prize is, only the restaurant manager.  Well, he opened mine first and I won DINNER FOR SIX!  I was so thrilled, then, he opened Walt's and he won DINNER FOR SIX.  This is worth $240.00.  We were so happy.  We are going to ask all the kids to come and chow down, they have gourmet pizzas but also lovely salads with gorgonzola, and grapes and sliced appled, chicken, and raddichio.  Many, many salads and pasta dishes. Ulla, don't be mad at your hubby.  Honey, this was just too much for him to carry alone.  He saw all the faces of the people that love you so much, and just couldn't continue the farce.  I think it was good, your mom is better off knowing.  If one of my sons had not told me something like this, I would have been hurt.  So we'll see how this goes, but don't be mad at him, he was at his wits end. Sue, now buck up girl, let's see that famous British Stiff Upper Lip, I know, I know, not so easy.  You need all of us to just hug you till you cry for mercy! GORGEOUS pix of the ocean, looks like the Oregon coast.  And what a wonderful son! You are all so precious to me.  Shirlann  ",

We had boats, she went on every trip, and she got seasick if it was really rough.   She went camping with us.  Finally, when all 4 kids had left home, she went with Walt and me to Big Bend National Park.  She stayed in hotels (the ones that allowed dogs) and we had so much fun with her.  The day I had to put her to sleep still makes me cry.  I have had many dogs since, but none lived my life with me or was such a big part of raising those 4 kids.  Many a tear fell in her brown ruff.  She was a wonderful, wonderful mutt.

Oh my, I sell all my books on Amazon,com.  They deposit the money directly into your acount, and all you have to do is mail the books, media mail.  They take care of all the money. I average about $150 a month.  Of course, it is an odd thing, the really, really popular ones are only worth .01, maybe you make a dollar on postage, but the strangest ones bring big bucks.  The site lets you see the prices of other people's same books.  So if you don't want to fool with the penny ones, you can find this out before you list them.  It is quite a money maker.  I have all my relatives clean out their bookshelves periodically, I have done this for several years. Oh, DVD's too, raid your kids, ones they are not using or wanting anymore.   It is quite amazing. Ulla, I hate the testing crap.  It just wears you out.  Here in San Diego, at least, they do tell me immediately if my mammo is okay.  I just wait for a few minutes for the radiologist to read the mammo, he tells me okay (so far) and I am done for another year.  Whew, I am so old, I was hoping to stop all this, but they say no. Syracuse Salt Potatoes, ummmmm, sounds delicious.  I am salivating! Lisa, if your family is complete, get the whole kit and kaboodle out, if you can.  I wish I could, but with HMO's we don't get to \"ask\" for things without a symptom or two.  I wish the little stinkers were GONE. I am sending Sue some vitamins, maybe they will get her back to square one.  I hope she will take them.  Nothing magic, but I know she is run down.

I've had a verry strange thing, after all these years.  I had a lumpectomy and the underarm dissection (no Sentinel node back then) and after rads that left breast was slightly smaller and \"perkier\".  So moving ahead, when my oldest son got married, I lost 49 pounds (didn't last very long), and I gained the weight back.  So, NOW my left boob is 1/2 the size of the right one, I think what has happened is with the surgery, a lot of my fat cells were removed, so when I got fat again, ahem, the right breast gained all the \"breast weight\", it is a good thing I am old, I look like a frickin' freak.  I really do.  And clothes are a bit of a problem, although I bought a sorta half fake boob, but I never remember to put in my bra.  I know, legally, I could get this fixed, but I am not gonna have any more surgery, period.

So happy for Lisa and Fumi, weddings, I love them.  Talk about jumping ahead, but I can dream! Love to you all, Shirlann ",

They love peanut butter, probably was full, if that is possible, or you did scare him away.  My favorite story, and this video was on You-Tube, a huge black bear came every night and swam for about 1/2 hour in these people's pool, then he sat in the hot tub, I swear, just like we do, before he lumbered off into the forest.  The people loved it, but finally had to call animal control.  It is a riot. I feel sorry for the bears.  They have not enemies (that they know of) so they lumber around, taking what they want, and humans don't like that one bit. Hugs, Shirlann ",

How having breast cancer can be really distracting.  A memoir by Meredith Norton.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK OR READ IT IF YOU ARE IN ACTIVE TREATMENT.  Sue, you cannot read it. But some of us, who are a little further down the road, this woman is a total riot.  I laughed myself silly. One quote that Sue can hear is this, she described her \"long bone pain\" as feeling like she was being stretched on a rack\".  But it was side effects. Fumi, I jumped all over that lady that wanted to know why you kept writing \"bump\" and posting it.  I told her that you and I and anyone we can get to help were trying to get the awful posts pushed down and that we \"bumped\", to move the real topics back to the top.  AND, in Japan, you have such horrible earthquakes, that one in Kobi was just awful.  Here, in San Diego, SO FAR, not too bad, just bumps.  I have been here 65 years  Arghhhhh, where did the years go? Los Angeles had a humdinger in 1998, we were in our motor home in a desert campground about 150 miles away and it shook so hard it woke us up from a sound sleep. To all our lovely group of sweethearts, hugs and kisses, Shirlann  AE such good news about UB!  GO GIRL, have a ball at Pinkstock. Kaloni, I too just love cardinals, of course, we don't have any here, just stuffed ones at our craft shop, and that is sick. Lisa, it is fun to fall in love!  Have a great time with Mr. McDreamy! Ulla, honey, I am getting this feeling that somehow, you have pissed off Sweden.  They are torturing you.  I have had that happen, too.       ",

Sue, you minx, did you bat your eyelashes at the millionaire?????  I hope you are feeling a little better, I was amazed when I read in that book that the woman felt like her long leg bones were being pulled apart, sounded like your pain.   She is 3 years out now, and fine.  Hang on sweetie, you will feel better soon. Oh Fumi, Jule, and Lisa,  so much fun!  ahhhh, memories of those days.  So sweet to fall in love. Judie, I haven't had the courage to try the pie, it sounds so yummy, I will get off my butt and get the ingredients. Ulla, love, I wish you were here.  Not that our docs/oncs are any nicer.  Some are, but some are buttheads.  Not fair, people who deal with cancer patients should take a course in kindness, just a pat on the shoulder, a smile, a little encouragement.  It means so much, I used to get scared, like Sue, at every little thing just after treatment ended.  My onc was so sweet, he didnt do a single thing, looked at my breast, felt my neck, and said, \"Oh, you are just fine, stop worrying\".  And I believed him.  It meant so much and kindness costs nothing.  Oh well, just come here. Wren, once you get to a certain point, you heal fast.  Hopefully, that day is near. Oh Sue, it is so much fun, what in the heck is \"tipple\"?  I know, I know, it is your favorite drink.  Well, I am a sorta tee-totaler.  Ahem, never could afford anything at first, married at 18, baby at 18, Walt still in college, I had to quit college and go to work to support us, I worked until 2 weeks before my baby boy came.  We had no car for 4 years and no TV, either.  Poor, we were so poor. But once, in 1976, I ordered a Singapore Sling, because I loved the name, it was funny tasting, like paint thinner.  hahahaha    AE, when you get home, you lucky girl, kiss UB and come tell us alla bout Pinkstock.

Ahhhhh, Fumi, I am so happy!  What a wonderful thing to happen in your life.  Here's to many years of bliss and joy together.  Ah, love, what happiness blooms in our hearts! Yes, Jane, it was very special, since I missed all three of my own.  The first one, vaginal, I was passed out cold.  Woke up in a room alone, rang for the nurse, and asked her \"What did I have?\".  Annoyed at me, she came back about an hour later and said, \"a boy\".  I said, how is he?  How much did he weigh?  She said, \"I don't know, wait until morning,\"  and left.  In the 50's they would not let you see your baby for 24 hours!  I was appalled, since I wanted to nurse, which the staff all discouraged.  Then, the second one was a C-Section, Placenta Previa, I was in hard labor for 7 hours because the anesthetist never got the first message, so I just laid there in the hall, all alone (no husbands then) and groaned.  Never saw my second boy, except for a few seconds in the delivery room.  Then, the 24 hour rule was still in place, but I begged the nurse to let me see my third little boy and she snuck him in with the other babies.  Sheesh, and my husband never had in part in any of this, way back then. I have lost 11 pounds on weightwatchers, but I have lost 30 pounds so many times, I am a hopeless yo-yo dieter.   Ah yes, Judie, I love the fall.  It is my favorite time of the year, too.  So sweet and I love the sun, shining kinda slanted. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SWEET SUE, DID YOU EVER GET MY PACKAGE??????? It had the flea medicine in it? Wren, so many women complain of this, and the general concensus on the wieght gain is the cortisone that they sometimes use to help with the chemo side effects.  Ah, breast cancer, the gift that keeps on giving. Karen, Nancy and Sheila, so good to see you, and your dear faces (well, the dog is sweet, too). So hugs and kisses to Kaloni, our dear AE & UB and all the others I might have missed.

So if you are not satisfied, you need to push for better answers.  If the group you are with refuses to do anything more, like my group did, move on to another group. I was told my lump was \"smooth\" and cancers were spikey.  Well, I had an odd sub-type of breast cancer that is called Medullary and is characterized by \"smooth edges\".  So if you feel you want to go farther, if you are not happy with vague answers, move on. Oh, I got that, \"Its too small, I couldn't find it anyway at surgery\". and only to have this very same surgeon two years later do a sonogram to place a fine wire in my lump and then take it out.  I was flat lied to.

Especially working with the public as you do. So keep a small bottle of that anti-bacterial stuff with you and use it before you touch or put anything into your mouth. Keep your hands away from your face, eyes, nose. This is the best you can do. I read one magazine article and he said the germiest thing in the restaurant is the menu! Who woulda thunk that? Anyway, do your best, but you will get things. Your immune system is in the toilet. Just the nature of the beast.

They warily strut around each other, sniffing, waiting to see what is happening, very suspicious that one of the other roosters will get their hen(s). No, I know that some men develop very long, strong and solid relationships with other men. Lifelong, in some cases. But for most men, we are it. They just don't have the mental wiring women have. We are instantly close. Whether it is the total lack of competition, or just a difference in the way we were made, who knows? But it is interesting to me that elephants live in totally matriarchal societies. The head female runs the show, period. And they stay together all their lives. They have sons, and they let them stay in the herd until they are about 15, then they run them off. I wonder why? haha Bears have nothing to do with males, only to mate. Lions live in mother, sister, aunt groups. The males are just for sex. Then, out they go. I think it is the competition. Men are hard-wired to be competitive with each other. We are not. Anyway, I never wanted to be a man. I love all of my sisters, and, while it is easy for me to say, since I am a long ways past treatment, this cancer was almost worth it for the relationships I have formed with so many women. My, we are quite a wonderful group. To hear the heartfelt thoughts, the love, the kindness, every day, makes me proud to be a woman. Enough sappy stuff. But I really mean it. All of us love our Sue, and we never have met her. But she needs us, and that is enough. I think any of us would walk through fire for her, if she needed it. How wonderful. And Sue, at work of course, or, trying to sleep. Poor darling. I wish we could all live in a big motel-like place, fix her meals, watch the boys, help her when she is scared. But thank God for this Internet. What a blessing. My my, we are so lucky. Well, that's all the preaching for one day! I so love you all, Shirlann",

AE, so glad hubby is coming home, to his precious wife and together, you will win this battle. Little Sue, I love you honey, and I bet you have thrush.  It is because your immune system is on the fritz.  Has anyone told you to get special mouthwash and toothpaste?  I think it is supposed to help with this and other mouth problems.  WORSE!  Dang it, you were supposed to feel better with this new chemo.  I wonder, shingles takes about 6 weeks to completely recover from.  The job is not good.  I think you are physically and mentally overloaded.  I sure wish I could whisk you off to my private island for 4 months, if I had one.  But, you are loved and treasured, and you will live to be an old, old lady. Ulla, hang in there honey, what are you using on your eyes?  They should be better by now. Last Tuesday nite I went to sleep really early.  Walt was left with Dusty under the covers and Cleo on her pillow over my head.  All asleep and peaceful.  Then, Cleo decided to stir things up.  First she jumped on Dusty, he got up looked very pissed, and stomped off to his own bed on the floor.  Then Cleo, somehow, got behind the bed and grabbed Walt by the ears (he head was on his pillow, he was reading), he shrieked in terror and Cleo raced off and down the stairs.  Then, she began to play hockey.  Our couch is gone, we are getting a new one, and the floor is tile, so she bats her toys all to one end of the room, then back the other way.  Walt was livid, he told me he almost strangled her.",

It is nice, everytime I look up, it is NOT at something I should be doing. Best reason of all for a vacation. I can e-mail on the ship, so if I can figure out how to get the pix on, or one or two, I will. Love you all, Shirlann",

I am 72, 9 years post treatment, and doing fine.  I tell you this because even in the very unlikely case that this is breast cancer, with today's treatments, it is not that bad.  90% of the women with breast cancer do just fine. So I guess you need to know that it is very unlikely that this is BC, and even if it is, it is entirely curable.  Not a fun thing, but your mom, like me, only remembers the awful days when they really could do nothing to help women.  Those days are long gone. Post often, with any questions, this board is full of kind, some very well informed, helpful women who will stay with you all the way. Don't get too worried if you read other posts.  First of all, a lot of these women currently in treatment have a problem or two, so they post.  The dozens of women I have met over the past 5 years are long gone and are living their lives.  So it looks like everyone is in trouble, but that is not true.

It is still warm here, we had those awful fires in our back country, many people lost their homes.  Except for right along the coast, San Diego is really a desert.  And when people build houses further and further east, they get in dryer and dryer areas.  Then, they plant trees which burn in a big fire like roman candles.  Well, I hope that is over for now.

San Diego is only 12 miles away, and the ship left from here and returned here, so it was quite easy with no flights. The Mexicans are wonderful neighbors and we are very lucky they are close to us and willing to share their lovely country. Sue, you will have days like this. When things seem so overwhelming it just seems too much. But you just need to remember to take one HOUR at a time. Baby steps. Try not to jump ahead and solve the world's problems. This journey is so different from most things we face, long, you feel sick, I can't think of anything worse except a prison term with no end in sight! But you will have an end. You will get well, it is a series of ups and downs, a rocky road, but keep coming back to us. Dear Fumi had a hard, lonely journey too. And look at her! A solid rock of a woman and beautiful too. This will be you one day. Oh, Fumi is entirely correct, that post is a \"troll\". Or, a person who is either selling snake oil, or just a nut, or a person who gets their jollies with people with cancer. Don't go near that site. Fumi hit it head on, only one post, always beware. Just stay away from those people. It is hard, honey, but keep on keeping on. You are loved. XXXOOO Shirlann",

But the ones of us lucky enough to have this God given gift of life, can feel better in so many ways.  I have 3 children, two in Tanzania, and one in the Phillipines that I support, it is not much, but they all 3 can afford school, they get health care and a little money for their families.  It is very little, but in my mind, do what you can.  If every one of us did what little thing we could, lives would be better.  My one little boy in Tanzania, I asked that they buy him a goat.  Well, in the last 2 years she has had 3 babies.  I also bought the family a rooster and a hen, now they have flock of chickens!  I get pictures from them and it is such a blessing.  It is a grandma and Richard and his sister Jennifer, their mom died in childbirth and the baby she bore soon after.  But in this tiny little way, my heart lifts when I see their smiling faces, such a blessing.   It is so little, but there are 750,000 children, worldwide, in this program, and when I feel hopeless, I get out their pictures and it heals my heart, for at least 3 families in this world, I can make a difference.  So if there is a charity, or a church food distribution center, or an old folks home, give something of yourself.  We cannot solve it all, but if each one of us who is able does just a little, we can make a difference.  Our church says, anything is wonderful, \"Time, treasure or talent\", and we all have one of these.

Who owns the mansion?  Judie?  Whew, very very lovely. I too loved the animals around Sue's Shop.  We were in New York once and they had the corners all set with cows, in every color, polka dots, you name it, so cute. Love you all to death, Shirlann",

Now, as to the radiation, I am sure they whacked you with enough chemo to thoroughly rid you of BOOTFACE!!! It is a bit scary to be told, \"Goodbye\" to the people who have been watching you and been with you so long, every one of us felt like this.  Sorta, \"Well, goodbye to you too, but, but, but, but.....\" You have all of us.  And they are there for you if you need them.  This is a little like separation anxiety, no one is watching meeeeeee!. Perfectly normal.  I was done and done.  I went every 6 months for a mammo for 5 years, and now, just once a year.  Sweetie, you will come along just fine. You are so strong and brave.

Anne, the colonoscopy is NOTHING.  The prep is annoying, but the procedure for me was nothing and I was so mad at myself for waiting so long.  I went in, was put in a curtained booth with a bed, got undressed and covered up to my neck.  (I hate things happening around my private parts!)  Then, the nurse came back, put in an IV, with wonder medicine in it, Versed, I think, after about 10 minutes, they could have cut off my head, LA TI DAH!!!!!!  Happy juice. Then, to my surprise, they wheeled me, bed and all into another room.  The doc was there, I never felt a THING!  I watched awhile on the TV, then drifted off, about 15 minutes later it was done.  They wheeled me back to my cubby (Still covered up to my chin), I waited about 30 minutes, and went out and Walt took me home.  IT WAS TRULY NOTHING, no where near as bad as mammograms.  I do not what what they will do at your clinic, but don't worry, you will be amazed. Ulla, sweetheart, this \"out of body\", or \"where am I?\" is so common, but so dang miserable, are you on anti-deps?  If so, ask to up the dose.  You don't need to suffer like this.  \"Better living through chemistry\".  Love you honey. Hi and love to Karen, (the beautiful).  Thank you for the balloons, and such wonderful pix! AE and UB, the flowers are so beautiful!  Thank you so much. Sheila,  I am glad John is coming home.  Life is short, he needs to be near you. Jane, how is the little roo doing?  So adorable.   And our little Sue, I am sorry you have had bad weather, but it is cozy to sit and have a cuppa and snuggle sometimes.  I hope your mouth is better and the aches.  Have you tried Aleve?  It works for some things better than Tylenol or Aspirin.  Worth a try.  I love you, honey.

AE, I hear you, sister.  About a year after the BOOTFACE I went to the dentist.  He poked around and said, \"Oh, did you know you have a lump on your tongue?\"  I said, \"WHAT\"  He said, \"It is inside your tongue, and you know with your breast cancer, this could be cancer too,it often goes to the mouth\".  Frickin' news to me!  Of course, it was a Friday.  So he numbed me up (I was in shock), operated, and stiched up my tongue and I left.  I could not believe it.  So after a fun-filled weekend, ahem.  He did call Monday at noon and tell me it was nothing.  I thought all the awful words I knew, and I also thought, I have had enough, but I could not find anywhere to turn in my bellybutton, so I went on. Karen, congratulations with your mammo, such good news.  WHEW!!! Oh Sue, I would just love to grab you and hug the daylights out of you, but I would cry!  But tears if joy, damn ocean.  I so wish we were ALL nearer, I am thinking about an idea to stay at a college for a few days, in the summer.  They often let the rooms out for next to nothing.  They might even give them for free.  That would help a lot.  I will check it out.  Maybe Vassar!   Hugs and kisses to you all, Shirlann   ",

Now, Sue, you stay home and cuddle zippy.  No arguments.  Where is Ulla?  I worry she may be lost in the dark up there.

Netti, honey, just think of baby steps, one day at a time.  Try not to look at the whole thing.  This should help.  I am sorry. AE & UB, my prayers are with you.  This is so hard.  One dang thing after another. Watch the retail therapy, I was sure I was going to die, had a wonderful time shopping, and now, 11 years later, still paying off the credit card bills!  hee hee Love you all, Shirlann   ",

And another lady, met her infusion nurse in a grocery story, said \"HI\", and promptly threw up in the brocolli! Chemo is not for the faint of heart. You both get big gold stars with all of us.

DC came to visit, I got the food from Calif. Pizza Kitchen, and My son's Steve, and Marshall came and grandkids, Therese, Chris and Trevor.  BUT, they stayed from 11am till 7pm.  My mouth was so tired,  we waved goodbye, I walked upstairs, took off my clothes, didn't wash my teeth, didn't clean the kitchen and fell into bed.  Totally exhausted. I love to talk (as you all know) but yikes, this was too much. Ulla, how are you doing with the new onc?  It's gotta be better. Cat Nap that cat AT ONCE.  They don't know and obviously could care less about the poor thing.  I just read a book about a woman who regularly kidnaps cats and dogs from horrible owners.  Her neighbor beat his dog so badly the dog just cried, like a baby.  So she went over after about 10 of these incidents, and stole him.  (The fellow had a drinking problem).  He got another dog to beat, so she stole him, too.  She said, \"As a human being, I cannot stand by when I see such evil and do nothing\". Sue, little love, you are so, so tiny.  Just a little thing.  My, my.  And I love the pix of Daniel? or David?  And the dog pix was a treasure. I LOVE the red shoes, the basket, our sisters were so clever!  What a lovely group of ladies. I miss you all so much, I can't wait to get my computer back.  What a disaster, I will lose my address book again. Anyway, we have to figure out a relatively central place and just set the date to meet.  If we fool around, we will not do it.  So put on your thinking caps, first thoughts should go to those with children to think about, the rest of us are flexible.  Work too.  So come on you smart gals, let's get something together. I love you all and miss so much being here more.  This thread is  Like a sweet drug potion! Kisses to all, shirlann  ",

Kaloni, hope you are in a better place, sweetie. JUST STOP WORRYING, GIVE IT TO THE WORRY WART~~~~ Ah yes, well here we were, flown in by float plane to McNeil River Falls, on the Katmai Peninsula in Alaska, in a tiny pup tent, with 5 other couples.  We went to see the Grizzlies. We hiked into the river on the second day, 3 miles in the mud.  We waitied on a \"bear viewing platform\" and soon, a mom and her two cubs came right down the trail and walked by our spot, the ranger got a little nervous, and said \"shoo\" to her, she charged him.  He picked up his rifle, but she backed off.  We saw 21 bears, 4 big boars, and they fished about 30 feet from us.  This particular bear had the two cubs and they sat and watched her.  After a few hours (we could not leave until the tide turned) the two little ones began to play with each other and a stick.  Mom turned around and as hard as she could smacked each of them.  They sat right back up and watched.  They only stay with mom two years, and if they don't learn to fish, find the berries, and all the other stuff, they don't survive.  It was amazing. We got back to the campsite it began to storm.  The float plane could not get in to take us back to Homer.  I had only brought enough heart pills for Walt for 3 days and only enough food for 3 days, on the 5th day, they could fly in and get us out. I will see if Fumi will post a couple of pix. Hugs, Shirl ",

Fumi, I am surprised, I did not know it EVER got that hot in Osaka, aren't you a port?  Usually that makes it cool.  I too loved your Kiwi's story, sounds so nice, and you have always been beautiful and never fat.  Ulla either, stop worrying about your weight, honey, when you feel better you can go after the weight.  But right now, it is difficult to fight on so many fronts at once. Nancy, that is sooo great, hum, 5 pounds, now, I have been on so many diets, it takes me forever to lose.  My body goes into lockdown.   Judi, those pix are wonderful, looks like a heavenly spot.  Just gorgeous. Oh Jane, I would so hate to have to watch that terrible bunch.  So wrong.  I used to have a lady with a lot of cats, she loved them and cared for them.  Then, they got a beautiful golden retreiver pup, but he was wild, as they are, and she tied him to a horrible dog house in the back yard on a 3 foot rope.  Never picked up his feces, he just sat there and cried, day after day, week after week.  I talked to her and said why don't you give him to someone who will let him in the house or at least the yard?  She said, \"Oh no, he is valuable\".  I hated her.  He was completely petrified with thunder, and he would literally pull that huge, ugly dog house around, crying, trying to get away.  I jumped the fence and sat with him when I could and he just huddled in my arms.  It was horrible.  I called the ASPCA, and they came out, but he had water and shelter and they couldn't do a thing. Why, why, why do people get pets they don't want or can't care for.  Like Fumi, it makes me so mad I just shudder.

Jane, your little Joey is so darling, I love seeing that pix! Hugs to Lisa, Nancy, Ann, Kaloni, Judie (the lucky), AE & UB....

I just wondered?  Are you sad gals on anti-depressants?  I sure hope so.  This whole situation brings on a full-blown case of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, just like the vets.  And the anti-deps let you get through this time with little or no grief.  To me, they were a blessing from God.  They are not addictive, although you need to get off them very slllowwly.  They are not on the government's substance abuse list and they do not make you sleepy or dopey.  In fact, they take 3 to 6 weeks to work, you are just about convinced they aren't GOING to work, when you find yourself humming softly, \"Happy Days Are Here Again\".  Very subtle.  Now, when you get your feet back under you and your confidence in your body back, and the grief from the losses that seem to be happening way to often to those you love, gets better, you can get off the pills. Little bonus, they found out by accident that Effexor, one of the anti-deps, for some reason, helps greatly with menopausal symptoms.  So there is another benefit. Sheila, it hasn't rained for so long here in San Diego, we have half grown children who have never seen it rain! Anne, what DID happen with the bear?  Hope it ended well. Sue, little lovey, how are you sweetie?  Hope good.  Getting ready for a trip and thinking about it is almost as much fun as the trip! Hugs, and kisses to all my beloved sisters, Shirlann ",

Now, sweet little one, go in and find out.  You have grieved enough already.  This is nothing, mum says. So head on in, you will feel so much better when they poke around and you see that black stitch, you will be ready for a whole pint of Ben & Jerry's (or the English equivalent).  Fumi. love, almost on her way!  Now don't wait to get home, take a pix immediately and post it.  We are all dying to see your love.  What fun!  You will have a great time. Oh thank you Judie, you are precious to me too.  I felt terrible for years.  I felt it was my fault.  I was her mother since she was 6 weeks old and I wanted a daughter so badly, already had my 3 boys.  Life was perfect.  We tried re-hab twice, she lived with my oldest son, and he got her a job at his place of work, but she just kept going back to the \"street\" life.  Many years later, the county, due to a law suit, was forced to disclose any information that might affect a person's decision to adopt.  We found out both her parents were addicts.  Kinda had the deck stacked against her.  So I cannot say I felt better, but time did finally make it okay.  I just kept thinking if she had been in another family????  So many what ifs. Nancy, good idea to stay in, you don't need any bugs.  It was so good you did the chemo at the right time of the year, winter is so bad for germs.  Be sure and get your flu shot this year.  It takes time to get your immune system back on track. Tender, dear Tender, you are a gift from heaven, as always!  You are a treasure! Karen, I hope your heart is beginning to heal, it is so hard to lose a parent, like someone just slammed a door.  But time will do a little healing, it is just so hard.  God bless you. Jane, is that little Joey still with you?  Or is that a pix?  He is so cute, looks like a fawn.  I watched animal planet last night the Animal Police, I CANNOT watch that show, I end up in tears.  Hugs and kisses to all my precious sisters!  Shirlann",

I LOVE the pix, so I can put the name to the face.  It is such a good thread, we have all become like sisters.  Well, in some cases, better. Where is ULLA?  Did she get to keep the cat?  I sure hope so, jealous husbands, my dad was that way, jealous of our dog!  Well, not much news, getting ready for the Amazon.  Hope I don't get some dengue fever, filarosis, typhoid, malaria, yellow fever, bot fly disease, etc.  YIKES, I think I will stay on the ship! Love you all, Shirlann  s I love the pix!  I sure wish I could post some.  Oh well, I will send them to Sue when she feels better to post for me. ",

Another thing, Tamoxifen, and those other hormone drugs have truly been a huge help to people, BUT and we talked about this, nothing is free.  People who take them have a risk of Uterine cancer.  At first, they did not worry too much about this, as uterine cancer is easily treated.  But as the years have gone on, they have discovered that the type of uterine cancer Tamoxifen like drugs causes, is VERY, VERY aggressive.  Now that is not real good, and you don't have to worry about this. Truly, 9 years ago when they told me, they did not even make much of it.  It was just another thing.  It has grown in people's thinking since then, but I repeat, I was and am glad I did not have to use hormones.  Maybe I am whistling in the dark, but that is the way I feel.  Now we are REALLY sisters, well, more like mom and daughter, but REALLY tied together.  So stop right now worrying about this thing.  It is not worth one pence of your time!  I mean it.  Stop worrying.

Yes, Sue, if there is any knock on the anti-deps, it is they take quite a while to kick in.  And it is not dramatic, they just creep in and knit up the raveled sleeve of care.......(Shakespeare). I stopped them once, but don't do that, it is ugly.  When you get your confidence back and your feet back under you, it is quite easy to stop them, but it must be done veeeryyy  sloooowlly, in my opinion, all oncs need to give these to all of us, it is just silly to suffer through this, with busy lives to live. It sure can be done, and some women don't need them, some don't like them, and a very few, they don't work on, but if they work, they are a frickin' miracle.  You are not a bit droopy or drowsy, I had not one side effect except maybe dry mouth.  They are not on ours or the UK's substance abuse list.  And this is huge.  Means they are not habit forming or dangerous. If this journey through cancer were not so dang long, we could all hold our breath, kinda like childbirth, but it takes forever, it seems, to get through this thing.  And anything you can do to make it easier, I say do it. Anyway, I think Our Precious Sue is on the way to a much better place.  HOORAY, one chemo down, we will all count with you, sweetie. Love and kisses, I am checking the airfares!  Shirlann  ",

Sue, I hope you know that you MAY NOT commit suicide.  We would all have to join you, as we are sisters, truly sisters.  You don't want that on your conscience?   Remember, it will get better, you will recover, and someday, you will actually think, hmmm I did that? Now, don't worry a minute about the anti-dep stoppage.  The only rule is, you must do it very, very slowly.  If you are on two a day, go to 1& 1/2 for 2 weeks, then 1 for two weeks and so on.  You can most certainly get off them, just not suddenly.  So use all you need now, to get through this, and probably for a time after all is over.  A lot of gals feel very alone when treatment is over, so don't stop until you KNOW you are yourself. Ulla, and Mr. Ulla, thank you for letting us know how things are going.  We all get very nervous when one of the sisters is missing. Well Walt got good news from the doc.  His CT scan showed no tumors and no strokes.  He still tilts, but that is getting better.  So since the two \"biggies\" are not what is bothering him, they don't seem too worried. Anyway, it was a relief.  As a diabetic, he knows it is a disease that will never go away and will eventually kill him, one way or the other.  He is such a wonderful person, I don't know what I would do without him. Sue, we are just loving our little \"Zippy 2\".  She is such a doll.  She loves Dusty, when you are better, I will send you a pix and you can post it for me.  But I will wait until the Shingles are gone and you are closer to the end of this mess. All my love to everyone of you wonderful, kind, precious women. Hugs, Shirlann",

I took a small tape recorder with me to all the meetings and appts.  Then I didn't have to take notes or try and remember. I like Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, do not read ahead, just what you need to know.  The later chapters will scare you and you do not need that info. Ask your doc for some help with the nerves.  Ask for Ativan, valium, or something so you can sleep at night.  Night time is always the worst, the squirrels come and run around the room and mess with your mind, usually between 2 and 4am.  Grrrr, but we all had them, so that is normal, but with a little chemical help, all this will be much easier. So you are in good shape with DCIS, this is not fun but you are in the best position of all.  Your little nasty \"thingys\" are confined in one place.  That is wonderful news, if you have to go down this road at all. Just know you are welcome to come anytime and ask anything.  Some of these women are very knowledable, especially Beesie, she can connect you with sites to explain things. So come often, someone is always around. Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

I still think you are having residuals from the shingles.  That is a long time thing.  Not a few days, but weeks.  Is there some way you can go on public assistance, just to finish?  I know you would hate that, but for heaven's sake, don't put your job ahead of your life.  Think very carefully, you are really quite close to the end.  February is almost gone.  March, April, May, then you can count the days.  Think of how far you have come. AND throw a royal fit, see if they are doing all they can for you to stop these awful side effects.  I am a little puzzled you are having such a rotten time, and they don't seem to be able to help you.  Just seems not quite right. Anyway, sweetie, keep on keeping on, one day at a time. I have made a New Orleans doll of Tom, and I am sticking pins in him.  This is supposed to work.  Some kind of Cajun witchcraft, we'll see, let me know if his nose falls off.

The only caveat is, when you get off them, you must do so slowllyy, like 1/2 pill for 2 weeks, then 1/4 pill for two weeks and so on.  But you most certainly can stop them when the crisis is over.  They have been prescribed by the millions world wide, and I have never heard of a single physical side effect.  They did think that teens might have a higher rate of suicide with them, but personally, I think they were impatient, and did not wait out the time it takes for them to work.  But I don't know.  I just know they do not give them to teens or younger ones. Sue, you sound like you are doing a lot better.  Whew, I am glad, you scared me there for a while, little english rose.  I was worried you were fading a little.  But you sound so much better.  Life will be SO SWEET when this is all over. Ulla, good to hear from you, and don't be too upset by feeling bad and sorta lost.  That is just part of this whole nasty, long, and painful journey.  We all got to that part sooner or later.

Ulla, ask your doc for Effexor.  It is an anti-depressive, but they found, by accident, that a side effect of this drug helps with hot flashes.  A lot of our gals take it for this reason.  Nothing to do with hormones. We went to see \"The Counterfiters\" today, a German film.  It was good, but kinda sad too. Sue, baby, you just need to keep busy, honey, you don't do well at home.  Now is the time to think of our TV show, \"Jon & Kate Plus 8\".  This sweet couple could not have a baby so they had in vitro and got two beautiful twin girls.  She wanted another baby, he did not.  But she just kept after him and he gave in.  Well, they had SIX, that's right, SIX, all at once.  I really don't personally think he has forgiven her!    My pencil is acting up, but remember, you could have sextuplets and a pair of twins only 2 years older!   ARGHHHHHHH Love you all, Shirlann",

And since the only way to diagnose IBC is WITH a biopsy, and if none was found, you probably are having some issues with the healing.

Oh well, don't worry, I have known DOZENS of our sisters, and every one of them had their hair grow back, some liked the new hair better. So don't spend a minute worrying about that. My new kitten is driving poor Dusty crazy. She hides and pounces on him. He acts like she is not there. But he is suffering. He was sleeping next to me under the covers in bed and the cat walked right over him and climbed on my neck. Dusty was so insulted! They are funny, but my visions of them playing and sleeping together, I guess, are not gonna happen. Hang in there my dear, you are doing so good. This is a hard place. But you will get through it. I am sitting here thinking of you. Hugs, hugs, hugs, Shirlann",

And again, if you have the ability to find a breast clinic, where you won't be pushed off and on like a piece of luggage, do this, move on.  You can get your original slides from the facility that has them and your original mammograms and go elsewhere. And also, remember, your life is much more important than your appearance.  So if this is the stumbling block, think safety before beauty.  But this should not be an issue with a new facility.  This is a giant pain in the neck, but I can't imagine trying to fit myself around an obviously too busy surgeon.  You need to come first, period.

You are not gonna die. Your cancer was not in the nodes and there are hundreds of gals here who would trade you, ANY DAY, just for that. AND being a Triple Neg, after 2 to 3 years, your chances of recurrence are almost nil. So enough of this talk. You will see me one day, I will come in and order a Subway, this is what I like: Honey bread with roast beef, deli mustard, provolone cheese, spinach, tomato, a tiny bit of onion, olives and two pickles. Then, a LARGE drink. No chips, er, what do you call them, because chips are french fries? No salty things in a small bag, there. Help me out here, lovey. So see, you will be there with a big smile. I will grab you, hug you, and we will go get a pint! SEE, I promise, I promise. XXXOOOOO Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

One of the big problems for seaman in that day was scurvy, which is horrible and caused by the wrong nutrition.  Since they ate only hardtack (horrible biscuits) and salt pork, (more horrible), at the back end of all voyages (some were two years or more) they got this awful scurvy disease which swelled up their joints and caused their teeth to fall out.  Terrible disease, some smart British person (name unknown) realized that they were missing Vitamin C.  So, they tossed in a barrel of limes to eat each day and the British sailors never got scurvy again! Now, the Yanks, obviously dumb as posts, began to call them \"Limeys\", to tease them.  While their own teeth were falling out.  (Sue bug, aren't you glad we got our independence and you are not responsible for this mess of idiots over here?)   HAHAHAHAHA Hugs to all my dear sisters, I have been missing because Walt and I have been putting Marshall's house back together after the decorator finished and we are half dead.  I expect to return to life in a day or two.

Don't feel so hopeless, just get over that, you are going to be fine and will be here with us for the next few years, helping other gals get well.  I am 8 & 1/2 years post diagnosis and doing fine, there are thousands of gals who have had treatment and are living their lives in perfect health. I suspect that your doc and you are having trouble with the node issue.  All of our bodies, all the \"flesh\" areas have lymph nodes.  What they do is the surgeon grabs a hunk of flesh under your arm and puts it in a jar.  That is the end of his job, he has no way under the sun of knowing if he got \"all\" the nodes, no one does, and it doesn't matter.  Then, the jar is given to the pathologist.  He pokes around, finds a few lymph nodes, and dissects them, looking for cancer cells.  Now, we all hope and pray for \"no nodes\", but, remember, lymph nodes are designed to be the bodies first defense against invasion, by anything, infection, cancer, etc.  So if a few are positive, then the body simply did what it was supposed to do, stopped the cancer from moving on.  Don't stress too much over this.  Many, many of our long term survivors have had lymph node involvement. Come and post often, you are in a huge sisterhood and you are loved and cared for. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

Please don't make the mistake of presuming because of your family history that you will follow this path. Treatment is light years better than it was even 5 years ago. You can and will recover and live a long life. You do not have to cancel your magazine subscriptions. Every one of us have been down this black hole of despair. It is hard, at night the squirrels come out and run around the room and drive you nuts with worry, we have all had this and more. I am a life long anxiety/depressive/panic attack person. By some miracle, I was already on anti-deps when I was diagnosed. I truly saw the hand of God in this coincidence. You are deeply shaken and sad, who wouldn't be? But you will begin to feel better when you understand exactly what is going on and realize that 90% of us do just fine. My mom's best friend is 94, 48 years post double mast, lives alone and plays contract bridge. We felt so sorry for her when she was diagnosed, all they had was mutilating surgery and Cobalt! So please come often and post, rant rave cry. This is the spot. All your fears are our fears and you are a beloved member of this sisterhood, we will not let you down. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

I also take Diazepam for \"break through\" anxiety attacks.  When under siege, as you are, I take 5mg, 4 times a day, I don't wait for an attack, I take them regardless, until the stressful situation is over.  But I am a big gal, so that is okay for me.  I am a life-long anxiety/depressive.  Like Portia, I don't like to sound like a drug pusher, but a little chemical help to get you past the surgery might be a big help.   You need to do this, any way you can get through it.  Please don't worry about mets.  First of all, it is highly unlikely you will get them, and even if you do, they are very, very treatable today.  Women live for many years just knocking them down when they pop up.

I mean that. I am 9 years post treatment, and in my small bible class, when I told them, way back when, the class only has about 25 members, 3 gals piped up. One was 22 years post treatment, one 17 and one 11. I was shocked, no one had ever said a word. Add 9 years to all those numbers, as each and every one of these women are still just fine. My mom's best friend (my mom died 12 years ago of a stroke) is 94, lives alone, plays contract bridge, and is a survivor of a double mast back in 1958! All they had then was Cobalt. You will get well, you will do fine. This is not a fatal disease for about 90% of us. A lot better percentage than heart disease. The word cancer just scares us all. Partly because for so many years nothing much could be done, but that has all changed. So try not to let those worries get you down, you will be around for many, many years.

Now, these cancers CAN be, not for sure, but CAN be aggressive.  But the interesting part is, if you get through 2 or 3 years without a recurrence or metastasis, triple negative breast cancers VERY RARELY RECUR after this much time. This is just another thing.  Try not to focus on it or worry about it.  It is what it is.  As you know, I am 9 years out of treatment and just fine.  So being Triple Negative is not ideal, it is far from the end of the world.  I was glad I did not have to take Tamoxifen or Femara, because these drugs are wonderful, but like all medicines, not side-affect free. So stop worrying about this.  You cannot change it, and the fact that your lymph nodes were negative means nothing has passed on to the rest of your body, so being triple neg, means a lot less. There are so many aspects, some are good (like no lymph nodes), some are not so good, (triple negative) and some don't matter.  It is what it is.  It is still just another part of the picture.  So don't focus on this too much. You will live to see Charles on the throne and probably William, too.  With maybe Kate Middleton as Queen.  That will be fun time.  I have stayed up all night for all the weddings and funerals since Margaret Rose married Antony Armstrong Jones.  So keep the pint handy, we will be together.  I promise. And keep all the things you are being told in perspective.  You have passed with flying colors the real, real biggies, all your scans were clean and no nodes.  Concentrate on this and forget about the other, can't change it, so don't dwell on it. You are loved and cherished, our Sweet Sue, you will be just fine. Hugs and kisses, Shirlann",

Not often, but some. And, of course, as with any drug, some people have to try different ones to find one that works. But this is rare. When you get your confidence back and your feet back under you, you can slooowly get off them. They don't want you to just stop abruptly, but taper off. So that is the next step, at least that is what I would do. You do not need this much stress along with all the other things you are dealing with. The anti-deps do not affect your mind or ability to work, I worked 7 years on them and had not one adverse affect. So this is the plan. I worry when you get so down. You are going to be just fine, this Triple whatever is not nearly as important as the negative nodes GREAT NEWS and the clean scans GREAT NEWS. So focus on that and forget the triple whatever. You are loved and you do not need to go anywhere. We need to be able to find you, so you stay right here with all your friends. No need to go to any other site. In fact, stay off that site.

You get a lot from your work, I did too, but you need to go home when you get tired. I know this is hard, the work ethic is firmly established in your head, and I think work is good for you, BUT, when you are finished physically, you must go home. You will continue to catch things if you are too tired. So think of it this way, they are lucky to have our precious Sue at all. So you must put yourself first and when that overwhelming fatigue hits, go home. You are turning into a wonder child, but you must watch out for yourself. Take good care and they will understand, they love you just as we do. Oh, I have 3 sons, one is 52 and grey, one is 49 and grey and the youngest, at 46, still has brown hair, but is losing it! And, oh, how I wish I had my little sweet boys back! BUT, grandchildren will be along and they are so much fun. You will love them even more. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

I know about the work. It was better for me, too. I just worried at home. When you are at work, you can only think about that, and that is good. We ALL hate this danged disease, after a lifetime of walking into the docs with a sore throat, and maybe a sore back, getting well in 6 days, we are all spoiled rotten. I will tell you a story about my last boss. She had a daughter, her 3rd and last child. One day, as we all know the \"period\" started. This girl was extremely athletic, all sports, and very much the Tom Boy. Well, Dotti was sympathetic, Katie was wailing about what a mess it all was, they went to the drug store, got her all the the stuff and on the way home in the car, Dotti starts to talk to her about different things, accidents at school, first few days, the whole nine yards and Katie literally leaped off the car seat and shouted, \"What? You mean this happens every month! I thought it was just once!!!!!. This is absolutely true! And Dotti and I have laughed about this for all the years since. Poor Katie thought the period happened just once in your life and that was it. Anyway, that is my laugh for the day, to take your mind off of bootface. Remember, honey, one step at a time, one day at a time. You will make it and we will all meet at Hyde Park and have a picnic and a hug fest! Love you, Shirl",

I would refuse to let it hurt you by falling out in clumps. Screw the hair! Lop it off! Then, you are so pretty, I know you will look just fine. Some of the gals look better in their wigs. We had a Southern Calif. luncheon last month, and one of the gals had a sorta short do with beautiful streaks, and I almost asked her who did it, when she said it was a wig.

Yes, show her the hair, many people don't realize this about the hundreds of different colors in natural hair, even blondes, and take it from me, how phoney the dyed one's look.  Your photo of Portia is sssoooo good you can actually see the dozens of slightly different shades, that makes hair so pretty.  Not to mention the damage dyeing does.  But she is young, I almost had a heart attack when my son got an earring in 1974, now, that looks tame, I have a grandson with not an earring, but a sort've plugs, it just looks horrible.  Ughh, but, praise the Lord, he is not mine, I love him to death, but I actually got the courage to tell him \"Oh, that looks great\".  Grandmas get special permission to lie like that so the kids will like them.  hahahaha Sue, now don't be poking it.  I, in my very long life, have tried that with a few things and it doesn't work, and boy, are the docs mad when you get in.  But does it hurt?  By now, you have probably made it so mad, feeling, pressing, pushing, moving, it's probably saying, \"Lady, leave me the frick alone\".   hahaha, you will be fine, it is just a hair follicle.   Oh the kitty pix are just darling.  The new, black one looks just like Cleo.  She sleeps all spread out like that too.  They are so precious.  I caught Cleo rubbing her head on Dusty the dog.  She walked under his chin, let her tail rub his face, then back again, then she laid down and rubbed her head on his.  The dolt, just sat there, she wanted him to snuggle her, I think.  But they are friends, that is good, maybe they will sleep rolled up together some day. Yes, our dear Fumi should be in the air on her way to her Pooh-Bear.  I sure hope he is good enough for our lovely Fumi. Hang on, dear precious Sue, hang on honey.  This road is long and bumpy (you don't need me to tell you that) remember my tongue lump.  It was nothing.  Scared me speechless. Of course it happened on a Friday, so I had a real lovely weekend seeing if the BC had come back in my tongue, of all places.  Sheesh, it had not.  After that little fiasco, I decided I wasn't going to let Bootface get me like that again. Hugs and kisses to all, it is about 3:30am in London.  So I hope Sue is asleep.   Love, Shirlann",

What a couple of idiots.  His box has his NAME on it, and I blythely took it out of my cupboard, (his is stored elsewhere), chugged all this down, and have been sick for 3 days.  Of course, I got a great panic attack out of the whole thing too.

I have to tell you all the most romantic story I have ever heard, and it is true.  As you know, I live very close to the Mexican border.  And in years past the Mexicans have come and worked and gone home pretty regularly these many, many years.  Well this story I heard from this couple's daughter. It seems that not far below the border a 14 year old girl was out in the field of corn with her parents working in the hot, hot sun.  Along came a young 15 year old Mexican boy on a horse from Oaxaca.  (Another state)  He was on his way to the US to work for the season.  As he got closer to her, she looked up at him, and he looked down at her.  Something must have clicked.  He reached down with his hand, pulled her up behind him on the horse, and they rode off together.  They have been married 50 years, have 4 children, and have been blissfully happy ever since.  I love this story.  I know every word is true, as I became friends with their delightful daughter, who was so full of fun she loved to tell this story of her parents.

Mel, I am sorry honey, life can be such a hard road.  But I think you will be better off when you can recover, it just takes time. Sweet  Cathi, your dear face lights up the whole chain of precious notes from all our friends.  You are so pretty and dear.

We had a good time in Bufffalo, it was a looong trip for just two days, and it has taken me 3 days to recover, man, those airplanes are horrible!  But the falls were gorgeous. Humm, Judie, Jealousy and envy.  Two hard ones.  It is hard not to care.  I think if they are not exactly the same thing, they are best friends, to drive us, sadly, nuts.   If you figure this one out, let me know. I am off to bed to get over this cold.  Dear Zippy in my heart. Hugs and kisses to all of you, Shirlann ",

I think Cathi is right, I resisted my mom's growing inablity to do things because I couldn't face not having her.  I just couldn't face her loss.

This is the info that they have found out to date. The first 2 to 3 years, we triple negs have a higher recurrence/metastasis rate than \"regular\" cancers. But if you get to the 3 year mark and beyond, triple negs cancers, for some reason, almost NEVER recur. Go figure. Also, the hormone therapy is usually not given to us. Some docs give it anyway, but generally, it is not given. When I was diagnosed, so long ago, not much was made of the Triple Negs, but lately, we have become the new cancer \"buzz\". Don't know why. But that is the way it is. Don't worry, won't do any good, and you will most likely be just fine. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

Cathi, pretty girl, start on 1000mg of Vitamin C every day.  I have done this for years and I rarely get anything contagious.  Can't hurt.

Now, since no one there will do anything for you, you just have to deal with this yourself.  The first thing you need to know is this is NOT YOU.  These feelings will go away.  Your body and mind have been to hell and back, and I might add, for you, it has been doubly difficult, yanked from your home and family, in a strange, cold country where the people are quite reserved, not like your people, not like Americans.  (we, of course, never know when to shut up or mind our own business). So knowing that you will get well with no help does help.  Time will cure you.  Meanwhile, what you can do is take a very good B Complex vitamin, (they used to give shots, years ago), but now the pills will work.  They help with the helpless, hopeless feelings. In addition to all that, as with so many of us, the holidays are a difficult time.  You have done so well, and you ARE WELL.  You have not had this whole thing happen at an easy time, so much upheaval, and sense of loss in your life.   The feeling of being \"tossed to the wolves\" by the medical profession is also very common.  You get a lot of up close personal care, people testing, running around, surgeries, chemo, on and on, then, one day, they just say, \"BYE\".  It is a little frightening.  You wonder if anyone is watching out for you and a million other things.  You are glad to be done, but afraid of not being watched.  This is called a \"no win\" situation. All these feelings are perfectly normal, but still difficult to handle.  If those idiots would start you on anti-depressives, this whole time would pass much more peacefully.  Without so much suffering.  But you are a strong, beautiful woman, and you will get through this \"after\" period. Hang in there, pretty girl, Shirlann ",

Lisa, don't feel bad, I woke up one morning and began to bring up old, old things I had done, wrong in my life, started crying, just fell apart, and I NEVER do that.  I went up to make the bed and in the dark I had tossed my Paxil towards my mouth, but it was on the rug!!!!!  I felt like a nitwit.

There are dozens of things it could be.  Maybe just a deep stitch, so try your best to wait till you hear something.   And this is not your fault, for heavens sake, you did nothing to cause this and did nothing to cause the little bump.  So take that out of your thinking.

Also, they encourage some excercise each day.  Either a walk, or a run, and of course any gym work.  It took me a year to lose the 49 pounds, but that mainly is because I am older, and have been on so many diets that my body is very resistant. So if you can't find a local office, go ahead and Google WeightWatchers, and read over it and see if this would work.  We can compare each week, and that is very helpful, a little kind, gentle competition works very well! So I get 23 pounts per day.  Just as an example, a banana is one point.  A Salad is free, except for any chicken or fish and the dressing.  They suggest you get the dressing \"on the side\" and just dip your fork into it before you eat the bite.  You hardly use any this way.  One small peach is no points.  They have lots of recipes for soup that are no points too.  Of course, with all diets, the big no, no's are, sugar, breads, potatoes, too much meat, especially fatty meat, and sugary drinks.  Here, in the US, they sell lots of products, like ice cream bars that are only one point.  I love them.  I usually have a small bagel with non-fat cream cheese on it for breakfast.  For lunch, carrot juice from our local Jamba Juice, a salad and a piece of fish or chicken, broiled or braised, not breaded.  Then they encourage snacks, and you can check their site for their brands (which are quite expensive) or go to your store and find similar things (non-fat yogurt, etc) that are a lot cheaper and work as well. So check it out, see what you think.  I believe it is about $17.00 a month US for the on-line version. Hugs and kisses, oh, I bought your Biotin, it will be coming soon!  Shirlann    PS:  Judie, HOW did you get the hills for the trucks?????",

I think our Sue is doing much better.  I think she is in Spain.  What a year it has been for her.   Judie, sister dear, your post was poetic, you should write.  I cried when I read it.  So lovely, so strong.  You are truly a wonder. I am selling a few things on e-bay, along with my Amazon books.  I like it, at least when I get what I am asking for.  E-bay is so big.  My, I just sold a dress for $36 plus postage, but there must be 50,000 listed.  Many are never bid on. Well, must get to my invoices.  Hugs and kisess to you all, so precious to me, each one of you. Hugs, Shirlann ",

With Ned, almost 55 years with Walt.  haha Yes, Karen, I have made juice for many, many years.  Wore out my old juicer and got the Jack LaLanne one too.  I do a lot of straight carrot juice, I just love it, but you can put in bananas, as long as you have other liquid, any berries, and what I really like is the last few peaches, no one will eat, just peel them and stick them in (without the stone), You can add ice, fat free yogurt or ice milk or real milk, fat free, pineapple juice is a good thing to have on hand for things that don't want to mix up well, seems  to go with everything.  Then, get sneaky, and throw in parsley, or a broccoli stem, be careful, or the kids will notice it! haha.  But, ice really is good too.  We go to Costco about now and buy 3 or 4 big boxes of blueberries.  I wash them, lay them on a towel, wait a couple of hours, then put them in a ziploc bag.  You can use them frozen all winter.  Or any other berries on sale. Hi AE!  We missed you! Sheila, I am glad John is coming home, just feel better, him being out of harm's way. Judie, you look so good. I think Ulla and Sue, our newest \"cured\" buddies are definitely AWOL.  Getting their lives back, good for them. Hugs and kisses to all, Shirlann  ",

Hi Ulla, well, so much for WeightWatchers!  Darn it.  I like them because you can eat out, and I don't cook much anymore.  But Sheila sounds like she has a good plan.  Diabetic plans are often excellent, since they need to keep very careful track of your total health needs. How is your family, honey?  I think of all of you so often, how hard it must be to be so far from home and COLD, too. Yeah, Lisa, it is hard to shake old fears when you have been so badly hurt, just takes time.  I don't know any other solution.  Just time, and see where this goes.  It is hard to meld two different relationships.  My son is trying to do this, and the woman he was seeing is so focused in her two girls, it is hard.  He met another woman, but she is a very light drinker, but he doesn't drink at all, just doesn't like it, or late nights, so we will see.  Hard to get two people on the same page, he will be 50 on Saturday.  Judie, I did Oprah, too.  But never heard, she must get thousands of ideas, but I thought our's was super, especially since October is so near.  Maybe you will jog somebody lose! So sweet of SusieToo to post!  What a treat to hear from a long term survivor.  But my mom's best friend still has her beat, when she died at 90+ she was 44 years post double mastectomy, and died of old age, funny, she still worried at each mammogram!   haha, I guess that never goes away. Lisa, I agree completely with you.  We just have to see each other.  It is a must.  I know a hotel in New York that we had a few years ago, the Wellington, it is very nicely located, and it was a very nice suite, we had our grandson.  It had 2 TV's and 2 bedrooms was perfect for us.  I think the suite, then, was $150 a night, and it was in walking distance of Central Park.  I know I could get us a morning with Marci Beth at CBS, not to be on the show, but to see the set of the \"Early Show\" and the sets of the Soaps they do.  And FAO Swartz is near, and that takes a day.  It is amaaazing!  It has a nursery, with a dressed up nurse, and you can pick out a new born baby doll, and you get an adoption certificate.  It is two floors of non-stop fun.  I did not buy a thing but what a couple of hours!  So, if the hotel is still near that price, we can halve it because two can stay easily in one suite.  Separate bedrooms.  The lobby is nothing, but the rooms were clean and nice.  It was in Borat?  Remember, the Baron Sasha Cohen movie?   But we will wait to get Sue's \"All's well\", which will be here before we know it!  Not soon enough for Sue. Sue, is the \"spot\" healing up?  That is a big clue.  And keep taking your vitamins, I know it is hard to remember, but it is important since you are with so many people, and germs everywhere, but sure and get your flu shot, coming up, THAT you and the boys don't need. Hugs and kisses to all my sisters, Shirlann   ",

The Turducken was boned turkey, with the wings and legs on, stuffed with a duck (also boned) that was stuffed with a chicken (Also boned), the whole thing was layered with rice and pecan stuffing, or you could have cornbread stuffing or sea food.  It cooked perfectly, would feed at least 18 and serving it was a blast.  You cut it right in two pieces, neck to ahem crotch, then sliced it like a pork loin, so you can see the different colors of the meat.  It really was nice.  I have a special recipe that lets me do the mashed potatoes the day before (it is just adding sour cream and cream cheese to the potatoes, then put them in a casserole, they keep for 2 or 3 days in the fridge).  It is so much easier this way, you heat the potatoes and you would swear they were just mashed.  Then, I bought just bottled turkey gravy.  It was fine, not as good as mine, but I am glad I went that way as the Turducken did not have hardly any drippings for gravy. Back in Henry the 8th's day, they made this same combo, but they added a pheasant, a quail, a dove and a sparrow!  Walt said, \"Then, an ant\".   hahahaha  So this idea is not new by any means.  The people in Louisiana were great, it came exactly on the day it was promised, it was all ready to go and frozen.  I would recommend this, but it was expensive. Hey, the Valium takes about 3 days to work.  Take one (5mg) 3 times a day and keep taking it, then you will see results.  I keep one on my bed side and if I woke up in the night, or at 2 or 3am, I had water and the \"magic pill\" and could go back to sleep. The long term solution is anti-depressives, but some people don't want them.  They do not make you sleepy or dopey, so they work very well for gals that are working.  They too take 3 to 5 weeks to work.  And then the only feeling is, one morning you find yourself whistling.   Hugs and kisses to all!  Shirlann HEY SUE IS UP THERE!  HI SUE!!!!! ",

It was a fun trip.  But the funniest thing is that everyone was worried to death about mosquitos.  There is an epidemic of Dengue Fever (otherwise known as \"breakbone fever\") in Rio.  So all us cruisers were comparing Deet, and Off and arguing over whether we needed malaria pills.  And then.............I saw NOT ONE mosquito, at all, Walt saw one on the ship's elevator!  It was hilarious.  I don't know where they all were, but they were not where we were. We cruised 1200 miles up the Amazon and it is the wet season so it was 20 feet higher than the dry season and climbing.  The people live in houses on stilts (not in the cities, just the river people) or they have pegs and raise the floor of their house as the river rises.  It was amazing.  I saw and held a sloth, an 8 foot boa snake, an iguana, a tapir baby, monkeys, and a cayman (small aligator). We got to go in 10 man canoes all through the flooded forest and it was amazing.  The people were very nice, showed us their houses, and we ate piranha.  It was good.  The ship was great and we did not get sick.  That is a victory at our age. I missed my pets terribly.  Getting caught up on the hugs and kisses.  Now AE and UB, what wonderful news! Dear, precious Ulla, welcome back too, dear girl, we have missed you. And our Sue.  What a gal, a true AMAZON WOMAN!!!   Working and chemo and children and, and, I do not know how you have done this baby, but you are truly amazing. Love to all of you, I missed you and got the ship computer to work once or twice, but then it went on the fritz.  Hugs and kisses, Shirlann   ",

The people we met along the river were fine.  They even had a school.  There are plenty of fish and fruit, so they seemed to be doing well. In Manuas, which has 2 million people and is 1300 miles up the Amazon, the people work in over 400 foreign factories, they make electronic parts mostly (according to our guide), but also Harley-Davidson parts and get this, one factory turns out 3000 Honda motorcycles A DAY!  This area seemed pretty good. But I just finished a book called \"The Modern Slavery Trade\" and they had a chapter on southern Brazil and it went like this.  People come in big trucks to the small villages, which, according to this author are practically starving and offer jobs to the men.  Many of them accept.  They then drive them to a restaurant and they can eat as much as they want.  Then, they drive them many, many miles into the middle of the rain forest.  Here they are worked like slaves, far from home, they don't even know where they are, making charcoal from the trees.  Which is a dangerous, hard job, especially since there is so much rain.  Then the men find out they OWE this company huge sums for the trip, the food they ate at the restaurant, the tools they must use, the huts they live in, and at the wages they pay them, there is no hope of paying off the \"debt\" they owe the managers.  AND they can't run away, they don't even know where they are and the jungle, you could not survive.  Pretty glum and depressing.  I kinda thought that South America was doing better than this.  But along the Amazon, the people were educated, friendly, well fed and appeared to like us. (Unlike most of the world)  The last time we were in Amsterdam, my son and I, we went into a restaurant and they never came to serve us.  Europe, I gathered, blames us for the subway attacks in Spain and in England, because we invaded Iraq.  A lot of American tourists in Europe tell the locals they are Canadien.  Sheesh. So that is about all I know, it was truly a wonderful trip. Sue?  Are you okay?  I think this is your bad days.  Karen, I couldn't open the post, darn it, I know this computer is just waiting for me to get my addy book all back and then it will crash again.  Grrr.

Nancy, my congratulations too.  Girls are such good drivers.  I did something with my boys that worked like magic.  And I didn't realize it would.  I told my 3 boys that we would eventually have 5 drivers.  And we could not afford \"extra high\" insurance with even the tiniest accident, let alone a ticket.  Sooo, I told them each, any bump, any ticket, even parking ticket, and thing at all, they could not drive for 3 months.  They all agreed and wouldn't you know it, my oldest on the second day after he got his license, backed into a post.  Keys gone, He was heartbroken.  But we stuck to our guns.  Second son, 3 years later, FIRST day he could drive, bumped the front door panel on a light post.  No driving for 3 months.  It was harder on us than them, BUT we had 3 male underage drivers who never got a single ticket EVER.  And just recently, my youngest told me, \"Mom, that was so good, I could tell my friends when they wanted me to go faster that I couldn't or I wouldn't be able to drive for 3 months, it was great!\"  So if anyone wants to try this, it sure works.

Oh my one thing, I was a high School Cheerleader!  RAH! Love you all, Shirlann",

So be sure you bring her and all the family up to speed on how much better treatment is today and that you will be fine.  I think you need their support, so while this was so hard, it just had to be done.  It is the right thing, just imagine how bad your mom and sisters would feel if you had never told them, they would feel even worse. Tell your DH that it is okay, probably overdue, and he too needed the support from all of your dear family. You will be better now, I truly feel that as bad as this was, it was the right thing to do.  Very little good ever comes from deception.  This is true. So keep cheering them up.  Tell them you KNOW you will be okay.  And honey, you will.  Let us all know how things are going.  Your mom is tougher than she looks, and she will be fine.  I almost died when my son had a heart attack, but I recovered.  I would have been deeply hurt if he hadn't told me.  Left out and sad.  So keep on, step by step, you will be fine.  With much love, Shirlann",

Ulla, sweetie, just from me, I don't speak for everyone, but please on behalf of my husband and myself, please accept my sincere apologies for the total idiocy of the invasion of your country.  Again, others may not agree, but I am 73 and I think that might be the single dumbest thing any of our governments have done.  Sheesh.  So much sorrow, for nothing.  Honey, I have kept track of the amazing things going on in Dubai, do you know what \"Burj al Arab\" means?  That is the name of that fabulous hotel. Karen, you are so good to remember all our sisters in your thoughts.  You are a very special person. Well, I might as well admit what I did to my daughter-in-law.  I will plead temporary insanity, but that is a poor excuse.  We got along fine, she has been with my son for 20 years.  They have been married for 4.  All was well until..........my son had a heart attack, very severe.  He is my oldest.  My DIL is a terrible housekeeper, grey sheets, mildewed clothes waiting for the dryer, etc.,  BUT, we all know, that was none of my business.  Sooooo, oh I hate to tell all of you, I hired the Merry Maids to clean their house before he came home from the hospital,  I followed this up with a lot of cleaning myself.  You just do not do this with another woman's home.  So I truly do not blame her for hating the sight of me.  I humiliated her, and that is unforgivable.  Then, as if that weren't enough, I bought them a set of very expensive silverware, well, stainless.  I was over while she was at work, Walt and I were painting their bathroom, and I noticed the silverware was still in the boxes.  So (this is embarassing) I took out her old mis-matched stuff, washed her holder, and washed, dried and put in the new ones.  Believe it or not, I actually thought she would be glad.  Then, after she blew up at that, I realized I would have killed anyone who came near my house without asking first.  WHAT WAS I THINKING?  So, see?  I do deserve everything.  But to her credit, she doesn't say a lot, I just suspect the relationship is permanently damaged.  And she will never trust me again, and worst of all, she knows I think she is a lousy housekeeper.  Shesssssh, see?  You didn't think I could be so stupid?  I was. So, sigh, I made my bed and will probably spend my life trying to make up for this. Jule, I am changing doctors!  How amazingly kind!. Sheila, I am so happy your dear son is returning to his mom.  How wonderfully blessed that is! So, my dear sisters, no halo on me, I cannot believe that I was so dumb with my DIL, since  I had the world's best MIL, I knew better.  I so wish I could take all the above back, and rewrite history, but it can't be done. I just had to say that little Joey, is so so darling!  So precious, look at those eyes. Gentle hugs to all you dear, beloved sisters.  Shirlann   ",

To all teenager moms!  Try your very best not to be too hurt by the antics of the young teens.  I had it with mine.  My youngest was selling marijuana out of his bedroom.  Young guys kept coming to the door, knocking, going in his room for a few minutes, then leaving.  DUH!  Boy, were we stupid.  Then, one day, I was vacuuming his room and just under his bed I found a box filled with little plastic bags of pot!  I was so shocked I just sat on the floor and cried. Zip ahead, he is now a letter carrier and is a pillar of the community.  He has raised two wonderful sons and is 46.  I can't tell you the fear and grief I went through, and he came out fine.  95% of them experiment with things and are fine, not that you can ignore it, but just keep in the center of your heart the fact that almost all of them will be fine.  They go nuts for a few years.  I don't know why we didn't, but they do. Sue Bee, I am so sorry you are suffering, so sorry. Ulla, honey, I am getting to the point where I DO NOT LIKE THIS DOC.  If I were you, I would go somewhere else.  He sounds like he is hurting you on purpose.  I know many women who have started, stopped Tamoxifen, tried the other drug, etc.  I don't understand why he is being such a butt head!  I suspect he is an asshole.  Go somewhere else.  Couldn't be any worse?

But, are you screaming and yelling at the clinic?  Ask for some answers and insist on some help that will work.  Don't be a \"good little Dorothy\" and just suffer.  Get some help.  Remember, only the greasy wheel gets the grease.  HUH?  Didn't make much sense, but you know what I mean.  Tell them you are a single mum and need to work, and you are not recovering as well as you need to and what should you do?  Just pester them relentlessly. I love you, little sweetie, Shirlann ",

We had one day in Nagasaki.  First we went to ground zero, where a few Japanese veterans had petitions for \"No More Nuclear Weapons\", Walt and I signed immediately.  I was only 10 on that day the bomb was dropped, but I will never forget the pictures and the grief stricken people. Then, we walked up a lovely path of paving stones.  Up ahead were a giggly group of school children about 7 or 8.  All in uniforms.  Beautiful children, they all ran into a store and Walt and I went in too.  They had just amazing things.  First, they had coca-cola in bottles with a ball in the top.  I looked at them, puzzled, and we bought 4 for our grandchildren.  They had adorable small glass animals, different things to eat.  It was such a lovely scene, we took pictures.  Well when we got home, the grandchildren were so thrilled with their cokes.  When opened, they fizzed the ball up to the top, and my kids were awestruck!  It was amazing!  We don't have them here! Across the street was a store that sold nothing but super gorgeous, elegant plastic jewelry.  Odd and lovely shapes, of every kind.  I bought one, and I just love it. I guess I felt like I was in Oz.  What a lovely country.  You are one lucky lady to live there.   So I guess I just need to say you are a treasure to me and one of my dearest memories of this site.  And some day, maybe I can go to Osaka.   Sincere congratualtions on this 3rd anniversary, you are an inspiration!  Love you, Shirlann ",

Ulla, I just don't understand why you are having all this grief and so little help?  Idiots.  I think you can have periods with those drugs, seems like some do, some don't, but anyway, hang in there, honey, you will get throught this. Olivia looks soooo gorgeous,  I love the lovely girls in prom clothes!  What a fun time of life for mom, too. Sheila, how very, very civilized and sooo good for the children.  I read about a couple who divorced, both re-married, and somehow, (the God's must have smiled on them) they all four became fast friends.  They spent vacations together (with all their kids), Christmas', etc.  So wonderful, usually not possible, but how nice for the children, since they love you both. Dear Karen, my prayers are with you and your Dad, this is so hard, I am so sorry.  Where is Sue?  I bet she has crashed.  Does anyone know what halal is?  Extra work, for sure.  But Sue mentions it and I don't know what she is talking about, probably an acronym. SueBee, sure hope you are well and okay.  Please know that I love you all and will be back oftener when my computer is fixed.  I miss you all so much. Hugs, Shirlann ",

Then, where is Ulla?  Now, Sue, Lovey, EVERYTHING will bother you for awhile,  don't feel too bad if the first few days of your vacation you just sleep, there will still be time to do things that are fun. I think with the mental aspect of this whole thing thrown in, a good 6 weeks might see you feeling very good.  Remember, now is the time to get a Vit C (1000mg) daily, a very good B Complex, 500 units of D EVERY DAY.  You will feel better a lot sooner, and drink, honey all you can hold, that flushes out the stuff better than anything.  And do get a foob, you are so tiny and lovely, you can find all kinds of cute things to wear.  And you need to sort out this back (I am sure it is work) and arm issues.  Find out or figure out what is going on. I have had a very peculiar thing happen.  9 Years ago, when I had my lumpectomy and axillary removal, and it all healed, my two tatas were different sizes, but only a little, not at all noticeable.  My right was always bigger anyway.  THEN, for my son's wedding I lost 49 pounds, became a life member of WeightWatchers, etc, etc.  Of course, as is my habit, as soon as the wedding was over, I put the weight back on.  NOW, the right breast is twice the size of the left.  I think I got what amounts to a liposuction on the left one (the cancer one) with the surgery, and the right one just had the fat cells deflate.  SOOOO when I re-gained the weight, the fat cells in lefty were gone but righty just grew and grew, I look so lopsided it is ridiculous.  You know those tops that criss-cross and look so cute?  Well I have tried them on, and they all pull over to the right, where the big breast is.  They look awful!  So, I am most unhappy, but I don't want any more surgery, even if they offer it.  No more.  So here I sit, like I might fall over on my right side and cannot get up. Oh well, such is life.  Still waiting on my computer, snuck on Walt's. Hugs and kisses to all my dear sisters, Shirl",

England, I know, is smaller.  And I am sure mostly built up (although when you drive around, it seems that there is a lot of lovely land), and so you probably buy a used house.  A lot of people here like the older homes, they have more character and better craftmanship, in some cases.  But just as many people like brand new houses, with all the new goodies, new stoves, fridges, and bigger bathrooms. How are you feeling?  Are your bones any better?  We need a physical update on our Dorothy. Bootface is gone, what is going on now is the leftover stuff.  So you need to go and see what is happening.   You are so special to me and to all the other sisters, we need to know what is up.

Ah yes, Montana IS a lovely state, BUT, only in the western part, the middle where I lived, is part of that great high plain area, ugly as sin, cold, hot and horrible.  The western part is mountainy, with trees and water, and many famous people now live there, but they sure don't live near where I was born. Yeah, I have a friend who could not practice as a vet, she couldn't bear to hurt the animals.  They all shook when they saw her, so she became an exotic animal vet, works for a zoo, and all her patients, giraffes, rhinos, etc., are sedated, she is fine with that! Anne, here's a good vibe coming your way with the colonoscopy, and Fumi, for goodness sake, we just lost Tony Snow to Colon Cancer, he was Bush's press secretary, only 53, and his mom died of it when he was 17 years old, you get your pretty little self in there and get a colonoscopy!  I mean it!  I cannot imagine why Tony, knowing his history, did not do this.  It is the one cancer you can stop in its tracks with no treatment other than removing the polyps (painless, if you have any), and if all is clear, you don't have to go back for 10 years.  SO GO!!!!!  Cyber-mom says.

Oh, kangaroos, how wonderful, all the zoos in the world cannot come close to seeing the creatures where they live.  I feel so sorry, especially for the elephants, they walk, in the wild around 50 miles a day, live in close family units (all females) and are together for life.  How horrible that they are in a tiny enclosure with a chain around their leg.  A few zoos are closing their exhibits.  In Tanzania, in the Ngorogoro Crater, there is plenty of safe, sheltered room for them, they should all be sent back.  The Crater is a UN Heritage protected area and you go down into it in 4 wheel drive, so no one is poaching there.   A man who worked at a zoo had just flown back from Africa, and he put on the same boots to go to the zoo this day, and an elephant, who had been taken away as an infant, smelled his boots and went nuts.  She trumpeted, and shook her trunk, went berzerk.  Imagine, remembering the smell from all those years ago.  And then a zoo took it's one remaining elephant to a refuge here in the South.  She had not had over 25 feet of room all her life.  She just froze when she saw the trees and the pond and stream.  Then, another elephant ran to her, and believe it or not, they had been in the same circus at some point in their lives.  They entwined trunks, trumpeted and are now inseparable.  The black man who had cared for the first elephant for many years, just stood at the gate and cried.  He said, \"She is my family, I will miss her, but on one will ever put a chain on her foot again\". Judie, what a precious doll!  I miss my grandchildren, they all grew up when I wasn't looking, faster than my own kids.  So hug and kiss all you can, it is a short time! Hugs and kisses, to Jane, Fumi, Melody, Sheila, Ulla, Sue Bug, AE & UB, Nancy and Karen, and anyone I missed, Shirlann PS:  This is Cleo, our new kitty, she is my new avatar, I got sick of looking at my face and the pix is 5 years old and I don't look the same! ",

But go in, honey, you need to talk to them.  Tell them all the things that are hurting you.  Then you will rest better. Oh, check the calendar and see if you are near a period, this could explain the whole lot of symptoms.  Love you little one, Shirlann ",

Still, keep going back to the clinic, I know you hate to go, and I know you don't want to take the time, but you have to keep yelling at them or they won't help you.  DO NOT go near the chemo thread, you are forbidden, or the met thread.  You will just scare yourself silly.  Not a lot of people there with GOOD NEWS.  And you will get better, honey, I am so sorry this has taken so long, but you are very small, (I can see that) and the chemo was extra strong, and it is just taking a while to get out of your body.  I would seriously consider acupuncture.  Find a school, they do it for almost nothing, that's where Walt goes, can't hurt, might help.  They also, at least over here, do massages for very little money.  You just have to carve out a little time for yourself. We love you, Sue, and will not leave you, we will be here until you do a bungee jump! Hugs, and kisses, Shirlann ",

You are supposed to feel awful. And you do. This is the \"stuff\" killing your cancer cells. The rest of your body is none too pleased about this, so it is screaming in your ear, \"Are you completely crazy?\". \"This is poison?\". So that is why you don't feel good. So just take a rest and put your feet up whenever you can. You will make it through this, not easy, honey, all the chemo gals should get Nobel prizes. AT LEAST!!!! I am gonna go down and get my map of England and find out exactly where you are. We have been to Bath, Leeds, (I got to meet James Herriot, the vet who wrote \"All Creatures Great and Small\" in Thirsk). The town in Wales across from Ireland, and some other places, oh, Scarborough and Liverpool. I will find your town. So take it easy, dear Sue, and give your poor body a nice warm bath and a bar of chocolate, it is now good for us. Love you, Shirlann",

It was fabulous, and not all that expensive. The roads are closed so you drive to the South entrance, near Jackson Hole. Then they take you in on a SnowCat. You stay at the Snow Lodge, the big hotel is closed because they can't heat it. This trip is run by the National Park Service and we went over Christmas. Not very expensive at all. You can rent Cross Country Skis for a few hours, Snowmobiles, Show Shoes, and/or take trips to the various areas of geyser basins. The meal at night was really, really gourmet, just wonderful. Your kids would love this. All over the place are Bison, Elk, Moose, down from the high areas to sit around the warm springs. We just had a blast. You can stay any number of nights you want. We moved on to Mammoth Hot Springs for another few nights. We also took a dog sled ride in Jackson Hole which was a blast. We did this about 9 years ago. Ahhh, it was so much fun, we got into a 100 year snowfall year and had a wonderful time. Hugs, Shirlann",

Well, I have bleached, washed and scrubbed every frickin' surface in this house.  I have cleaned places that have never seen me before.  I have washed 8000 loads of blankets, throws, dog toys, my husband, the dog himself, er, no, not my husband and the dog, they refused. Anyway, the cat is in the garage, quarantined, Christmas at my house is fading like a dream, no one wants to catch Ring Worm.  And I am pissed to hell. It is a one month quarantine.  And it is transmitted by spores.  They fly all over the place.  Of course the new kitty slept on a pillow at the top of my head, in my bed, S**t.  Maybe Sue doesn't know that word! Sighhhh, I think I will fly to Sue's to help her. Love you, little sweetie, Shirlann ",

Two sulphur bathes later, she runs from me, not to mention the two doses of medicine each day. Poor little thing. SUE DEAR, are you okay???? Now remember, this is a rollercoaster. Nothing goes as you think. You just bounce from one end of this fun house to the other until you get out. NO ONE will take your boys. I will come over and shoot your MIL, if she has any thoughts like that. Can't happen. Call the papers if she even tries anything, weep copiously, scream about poor me with breast cancer, they will love it, and she will run for cover.

I am so sorry, honey, I wish something would help.  Have they told you you can take anything like aspirin, or Tylenol?  Something to help all the aches and pains?  Ask them,  don't be shy, tell them you need all the help they can think of.  And then, use it.  Don't be afraid to use anything that will help you get through this and kill bootface, once and for all. I was watching Keira Knightley being interviewed on the telly, and she said her teeth were all \"wonky\".  The interviewer said, \"what?\".  Oh, she said, that is an english slang word for crooked.  So, when you feel \"wonky\", try things.  A hot bath, Tylenol, there must be something that can help these side affects.

I doubt very much if this little thingy is anything, but since you are going in, be sure and have someone look at it. And for goodness sake, stop apologizing for being terrified, we were and often still are, terrified. You need to be able to be perfectly open and honest here, this is your safe place. You will have things, and fears for quite some time with every little thing that happens to you. I went to the dentist about a year after my cancer to get a tooth checked. He always does a mouth \"feel\" around too. He looked at me and said, \"Did you know you have a lump in your tongue?\". I almost had a heart attack on the spot. I was completely terrified. I think I scared him. He took it out, sewed my tongue back up and, of course, this was on a Friday, no labs open. Soooo, what a fun weekend I had. Then, he called and told me on Monday it was just a silly lump. I must have died a thousand times of fright. I couldn't sleep, eat (altho that didn't hurt me any) or even move around well. I felt like I was in a fog. I don't like you thinking you are with a bunch of amazons. We are not. Trust me, you are just as brave, just as strong. And I fell apart like a handful of Pick-Up-Stix when he said \"lump\". So talk about anything, you must know we are in exactly the same boat. I get a back ache and it is mets. I have had toe mets, mets of the hair follicles, you name it. Never just a headache, always a brain tumor. I don't want to scare you more, but you need to know that you are just as strong and brave as any of us. We are just a little further down the road. Of course you worry about the little \"thingys\", anyone would. So yell loudly and find out what it is. So keep on keeping on, sweetie, one step, one day at a time. You will get there.

Hang in there sweetie, and I got my PM, thank you for your sweet words, my little english rose. Now my sad tale.  And I don't want to hear a single laugh.  This is one of the goofiest things I have ever gotten myself into, and at 72, no less. Sunday before last, one the 2nd of December, I bullied my poor husband for a kitty, as you all know.   Well, on Tuesday, I noticed she had a little spot on her ear.  I put Neosporin on it and the next day, it was still there. So, I took her to the vet, she did  a scraping and came back in and said, \"sit down\".  I sat.  The cat has Ring Worm.  WHAT!!!!! 3 weeks before Christmas, and I have 17 people coming here.  Yes, and this is the protocol.  She has to be isolated from people and all pets.  She has to have a sulphur bath twice a week (think rotten eggs, think doing anything to a cat!)  She needs this medicine which is very expensive and only available at a regular pharmacy.  TWICE A DAY.  Cat's HATE this.  I went home in a daze.  And, oh, by the way, you have to STERILIZE your house.  So, we bleached the counter tops, we bleached the floor (I have tile, thank God) we threw away all throws, couch pillows, etc.  Then, we scrubbed our bedroom, (she slept on a pillow, right at my head)  All the covers are gone, the pillows are gone, the house, you could do surgery in here.  Then, I had to call all the relatives, no Christmas, she is in quarantine for one month.  All alone, in the garage.  I put on a special robe, go in, play with here awhile, feed her, and then when I come out, I ditch the robe and do a pre-surgery scrub.  I frickin' can't believe it!  WHY ME, LORD? And to top it all off, the Cat Rescue Lady called and said, \"What, she is in the garage?, well, she needs to be in a bedroom, that is no good!\"  $200.00 later I was speechless, I said, \"Oh, you are so welcome to take her back and I will get her when she is no longer contagious, be my guest!\"  (you horse's ass) I didn't say that, just thought it.  She backed off mighty damn quick.  I also said, \"And, you can cancel all your Christmas plans, too.  Won't hurt my feelings!\" Obviously, she quickly made a quick excuse and hung up. So if anyone has any complaints about Christmas and how much work it is, I don't want to hear it!   How about that! Fortunately, I had wrapped and mailed all my overseas Christmas gifts and even my local ones were done and stored in my closet, where the cat never went, days before I got the cat.  THANK GOD, so nothing is contaminated.         If anyone can top this for \"I DON'T BELIEVE IT\", I would like to hear it.  Grrrrrrrrrr  and to top it all off, Walt didn't want the kitten in the first place!

You are done with TWO of them WHOOOPEEE! Karen, your little boy is adorable, makes me sad for the old men mine have become! What happened to my little boys? WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAh I read that post, realized my house was spotless, ready for surgery, my Christmas shopping was all done, and I was sitting on my large rear in the garage playing with Cleo. She is so adorable. I have to wrap her in a towel twice a day to give her the medicine. I wrapped her all up, she looked just like a tiny baby, I rocked her, and patted her and sang to her and the little angel started to PURR!!!! Now that is an unusual cat. I gave her the medicine from a dropper, (which she hates, of course), rocked her some more, and here comes the purr back. Now that is a special cat, and she hardly knows me. I can't wait to get her back in the house, she was having so much fun, I think she spent most of her life in a cage. She was enthralled with the shelves, the cupboards, behind the couch, and wonder of wonders, she obviously was playing with a pair of glasses Walt had lost under our bed (he bought new ones, of course), and she kicked them out. Now she is a hero. Can't wait to get her back in the house, she is so patient and sweet. Only two more sulphur baths, poor little thing. Anyway, I decided to count my blessings, (most especially including Sue, and all you dear, sweet sisters) and enjoy Christmas. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

Oh yes, this little kitty is our precious bundle.  She is so sweet, she walks under Dusty's chest and then grabs his foot with both her paws, (no claws) I think they are going to be friends.  He is very gentle, and she is too.  They just don't know how to play with each other.  Dusty walks up to her with a toy, and she doesn't know what to do with that, then she hides behind anything and pounces on him.  But I think they will figure it out.  She is so full of life, she loves water, the toilet flushing is her high point of the day and she walked around the tub yesterday and fell in!  Boy, was she frantic, I got her out and she looked really pissed!   Ha ha, she will learn. Both you gals, eat for all you are worth, you can lose it later.  Your body is being attacked by the chemo and it needs fuel to stay well.  So eat away.  The biggest problem years ago was people got so thin and run down with chemo, that became a problem itself.  Anyway, I will try today to get pix of Cleo. Love and hugs, and kisses to all my sisters.  Shirlann   ",

Also, the gall bladder is an interesting subject too. I am sure that particular organ is not too happy with the chemo. Could be some sort of connection. How is ULLA? Did not see her post. Karen, Lisa, Angie, Honeygirl, HI Y'ALL! Sue, I would try Capsacian roll on pain reliever. There are several, they are over the counter, and they work.

Now, first of all, all our bio-rythyms are always low in December/January, less sunlight and usually dreary weather.  Also, it is the height of the germ season, so for Sue especially, with the public, you will catch every one, not to mention the boys, who will bring you home a lot of bugs.  BUT, next year at this time, you can laugh when you remember. And Sue, you will indeed be your old self.  Only better.  Why?  Because you have fought the beast and won, Ulla too.  This does give a little bit of a superior attitude.   La la la la la, I had cancer, now I am well, la la la la la.  Works for me!  You are not afraid of much of anything again.  You will be stronger. When ever you get those pains and aches that are on both sides of your body, usually it is something other than cancer, which has never been known to hit two exact things at once. Now:  for the uplift for the day, this is kinda long, but I love it. \"In the 18th century, in Ireland, a fine Lord had just married the most beautiful woman of his dreams.  They were ecstatically happy.  Then he had to go to London for business meetings for about 3 months.  While he was gone, his lovely bride contracted smallpox, and while she eventually recovered, she was now covered with horrible pox marks, and was heartbroken, since she felt hideous.  So when her dear husband came home, she asked for a divorce and refused to see him.  He cried outside her bedroom door and begged her to let him kiss her.  She weepingly replied, \"you could never love me now\".  Then, at his wit's end he wrote her this poem, which many of you will recognize, as it is now also a song.  It was written by him in the middle of the night, and he slipped it under her door. This is the poem: \"Believe me if all those endearing young charms which I gaze on so fondly today,  Were to fade on the morrow and fleet in my arms, like fairy gifts fading away,  Thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art,  let thy loveliness fade as it will.  For around the dear ruins each beat of my heart, will entwine itself verdantly still.\" Now, when she read this, she weepingly opened her door and fell into his arms.  They lived happily forever after. Sighhh, I love that story. So all of you, remember, it is what is inside you that matters, not the outside, and those that love you truly, will love you always. Gentle hugs, Shirlann   ",

But most of the folks were just tickled pink.  The food was good and a real treat. How is our Sue today?  And have we heard from Ulla?  I need to read the threads and see. Love you all, Shirlann ",

Ulla, yes, it sounds like you have stys in the eyes.  They can very well be caused by your immune system being repressed by the chemo.  I am sure that is why Sue got Shingles.  Makes me a little angry, they have a vaccine against shingles, and all our chemo gals need to get this BEFORE they start the treatment.  Sue, love, you sound a little better?  I hope the shingles are better.  Although it can take several weeks to clear up.  My mom had them and she told me it was pain worse than childbirth.  She was so sick and miserable.  You get to take your pick of what is worse, the shingles or the chemo. Honey, you are going to be well.  You will not have bootface back in your life.  You are right, many gals feel, when the chemo is done, that they are vulnerable.  You are not.  The chemo did its job and the bootface \"thingys\" are gone, forever.  But many, many gals feel a sense of desertion or left behind, and are scared of the LACK of people in your face.  Go figure, but we are all just human and that is what humans do. Valerie, bless your heart, I am so sorry about your dear husband.  I am in the midst of a lot of \"what ifs?\" too, right now, even though Walt got a good report with his head, he now has peripheral lack of blood flow to his feet.  Worries me silly. Rads are nothing.  But I would INSIST on a lead apron for your belly.  I asked, but  they said, no, so I let them get away with the no.  Get one to tuck in under your breasts.  I have had rib problems for 9 years and I don't think I would have if I had not been a wuss and had insisted on a covering for my underbreast and belly.  But after they do the \"setting up\", this takes a while, maybe an hour, but remember, rads does not hurt.  Then, when you go in, it takes longer to get undressed than it does to get the zap.  I was tired in the evenings, so I did NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING.  I worked through the whole thing and 6 days after I finished we left for a strenuous trip to see the whales in Baja.  Everyone is very different, I did not burn, some gals do.  But compared to chemo, rads are a piece of cake. Well, I love you all and will try to get on oftener, now that we have kinda settled Walt down. Love, love and tons of kisses to my sisters. Shirlann ",

Ulla, sweetie, I think the chemo has made you fuzzy, honey, it just tries to play with your mind, too.  When you are so sick feeling, the mind doesn't help a whole lot.  Of course, it is mad at you for putting things in your body the brain doesn't like.  The brain says, \"What in the world are the viens thinking\"  This stuff is really ugly.\".  The body says, \"Well, we are trying to get rid of all the cancer cells, and this is what we have to do whether you like it or not!\".  Then the brain says to itself, \"I'll make you sorry, body, I will fill myself with ugly thoughts, so you can't sleep well\".  The body answers, \"STUPID, we are in this together, if we work together, this whole thing will go better\".  The brain says, \"I am the boss of this whole thing, and no one said a word about chemo to me.\"  The body says, \"Yes, you were there in the room with the onc, you know this is what we need to do to be sure the cancer doesn't come back\".  The brain says, \"Well, I needed a break, so I was looking out the window\".  Now the body is mad.  The body says, \"if you are not going to take this seriously, I am going to give you the biggest headache you have ever had\".  Well, the war between the body and the brain will probably go on until chemo is over.  They never really did like each other. Ulla, sweetie, this will get better, think Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, this whole thing takes so long, it just wears you out.  And that is what is going on, Sue too.  Just goes on and on.  TOO MUCH.

Anyway, I am writting to a lady in Los Angeles, she has had a tough time.  This is not for the faint of heart. Sue, you just don't worry about melt-downs in the hospital/clinic.  Sometimes I think we are so stoic, they think this is nothing.  A little honesty might be a very good thing, they will be kinder to the next gal that comes in, so cry and shout away.  Doesn't hurt a thing, and it is good for you.

Now Sue, darlin', you are not going to die.  You are going to live a long, long life.  You will bounce your grandbabies on your knee.  Your boys will have you for many, many years.  All your tests and things are really very good and you should not be bothered by this beast again.  I understand this is hard to believe and hard to believe you will ever feel better, but you will.  And the memories will slowly fade.  So hang in there all my sweeties.  Hugs and kisses to you all, Shirlann ",

But when you KNOW that so many of us are just fine now, you can take heart.  Also, we are all with you in spirit, in the waiting rooms, when the curtains billow out, it is all of us, your sisters, watching over you.  We are in the surgery suite, in the recovery room, all our prayers and best thoughts will keep you safe.  You will NOT DIE in one or two years, you are going to be just fine.  You can trust us, we know. When I weepily told my small bible class, about 25 women, 3 of them piped up.  One was 22 years post double mast, one 17 years post treatment and one 11 years post treatment.  I was stunned.  No one had ever said one word.  You can add 9 years to all these numbers, as these 3 gals are still just fine.  So try your best to get over the dying thing.  You are not going to die. You are loved and cherished. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

AND they now have \"oblation\" pills for younger gals, if you are Estrogen Positive, that stop your periods and stop estrogen for several months at a time.  Super women athletes have used them for years, since their periods interfere with their conditioning routines, let alone the events they participate in.  Remember, if we were living in the bush, we would most probably be either pregnant or nursing most of the time.  This means very few periods, before we would be pregnant again.  The idea that your body \"needs\" periods is old-fashioned thinking.  So you can get your ovaries to an older stage quite easily and take that part out of the equation.  So keep posting, someone is always around, and you are loved.

They can't possibly know how many lymph nodes they get out. The surgeon just grabs a hunk of flesh under your arm, sticks it in a container, sends it to the pathologist and he digs around, finds lymph nodes, dissects them, and that is that. Some gals have a Sentinel Node Biopsy, where they inject dye in the Sentinel, or I think the important node, and if it is negative, you are good to go. I did not have this since it wasn't invented so long ago. Don't worry too much about that, you have to know what it up with these nodes, so just be philosophical, and expect the best. But here's hoping and praying for negative nodes! That would be great. Sounds like you are making good progress, and doing all the right things. Hugs, Shirlann",

And are you taking your diazepam 3 times a day?  Whether you need it or not?  It builds up in your system and you will sail in the hospital and not be a bit upset.  Stopping and starting diazepam, in this situation is kinda hard, because you crash when it is not in your system.  Once you get through surgery, you can drop to 1/2 pill 3 times a day, then slowly drop them all.  You will be feeling so much better.  You are going to be just fine.  You are going to live to be an old woman.  In my small bible class, 9 years ago, when I tearfully told them I had breast cancer, 3 women, mind you, 3 women out of 25 piped up and one was 22 years post double mast, one 17 years post treatment and one 11 years post treatment.  We are all 4 still here, so you can add 9 years to those gals.  I am telling you that times have changed and you have every reason to feel confident that you will be well forever.  My mom's best friend is 94 and 49 years post double mastectomy.  She lives alone and plays contract bridge.  She still gets nervous when her mammo's are due!  I told her she was a nut.  She just laughs. Sooooo, stop worrying, take the meds, take one step, then one day at a time.  You will be amazed how much better you will feel when the surgery is over AND YOU ARE ON THE WAY TO BEING WELL. You are loved here, Sueps, and we all are with you every day.  You are in a lovely sisterhood of women, and we take care of each other. Gentle hugs, Shirlann ",

I think just knowing that you are nearing the finish line has given you that famous \"SECOND WIND\" the athletes talk about. I have to talk again about the boiled dog. When we flew to China, of course, we had a 3 across seat and, of course, I was in the middle (I always get the middle seat). Well, next to my on this 15 hour flight was a very well dressed, nice man from China. During the looonngg flight, he did not say much, spoke english perfectly, and was a complete gentlemen the whole time. Then, as we got nearer to Tokyo (we changed planes there), he started to talk to me. He spoke of a few things, and we talked about China, and he said, \"Well, I am sure you will be offended, but the best thing to eat in China, is dog, it is delicious\". I was very proud of myself, I said, \"Oh, really\", and continued to struggle to keep from screaming. Just different cultures. I know as I grew up, we always ate chicken livers. And ground up, they are a Jewish delicacy, that I love. WELL, you know that nutty guy who eats the awful things? He said the other night, \"And we are going to eat chicken hearts and livers\". I was shocked that he thought that was strange. Well, Sue, baby, you are coming back to life. I am so glad. This has been a frickin' nightmare, that is just what it is, no way around it. And in the winter, all alone with two children. YIKES! Sounds like a book plot. You have been so brave and strong. You amaze us all. Love you all, Shirlann",

I read that you can get fake vinyl claws put on cats so they won't scratch your furniture?  But what if they get out and can't climb a tree? No, Sue, just because you have close family with breast cancer does not mean you definitely have the BRCA gene.  Marci Beth, one of our posters from years ago, did not have the gene and her sister did.  Go figure. So while you need to get checked, the family part  does not mean you have the gene.  Marci Beth had NOT ONE family member with breast cancer and she was diagnosed then her sister within about 6 months.  I think she was about 39.  That was 5 years ago.  She is just fine. So don't start assuming stuff.  Especially stuff that is going to scare you.  You are going to be fine, just fine.  You have too much in your favor.  All the \"good\" things that really matter, you have, no nodes, clean scans, etc.  So you stop worrying.  Oh, be sure and get your flu shot.  Also, start taking Vitamin C, you don't need a cold now.  I get the chewables, put them in my pocket and munch two or three a day.  Really helps.  Especially when you are with the public so much. Hope you are toasty up in your room, curled up with a down comforter.  Dreaming of good things. Love you, honey, Shirlann ",

With your new worry, you will have cancer everywhere.  I had it in my big toe, my hair follicles, my back, my ribs.  You name it, I was convinced.  We all are like this.  When they tell you that you are okay, all this will go away. Don't feel like you are going to die.  You aren't.  In the last ten years, even the last 5 years, treatment and understanding of breast cancer has taken quantum leaps.  The treatment is better, the outcomes have steadily risen.  About 90% of us will die of old age in a rest home calling a nice nurse \"mama\". So keep posting, and use that Xanax to get through this most awful time.  And don't feel alone, you aren't, you are now a member or the club of women who have banded together to get each other through this journey. Gentle hugs, Shirlann",

Oh Sue, that was the most precious post.  I am printing it and putting it in MY bra.  You are so dear, I guarantee you, we will be together, and not that far away.  I cannot live my life out without a hug and a pint with you! We had a good time, the activities director (and most of the crew) are British, and we had a right good time teasing them and them having fun with our accents! Maybe, just maybe, we could all go on a cruise when all our dear sisters are feeling good again, it is not that expensive.  Well, once you get to San Diego. Anyway, I will post pix when I get unpacked and get to Fumi, our computer genius, whithout her, I can't do a thing.  Well, I wrote on the screen once with magic markers, but it did not WORK. So, sweet Sue, just remember, each one done is DONE!!! Love you honey, Shirlann",

I love Israel Ka something to hard to spell singing, \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\".  It is so sweet, just like you. I wish I was with you, I would bring you red roses and sweet cookies and a wonderful bottle of champagne for after! In my heart, you are my girl! You are so loved and cherished.  Shirlann",

Hugs, Shirlann",

      "Content": "Oct 30, 2007 11:23AM - edited Oct 30, 2007 11:24AM by Shirlann Hey guys, all you need to do is e-mail TimTam (Fumi) she can get the pix on.  I gave up.  She does all mine.  I am trying to get a pix of me and my boys and husband (taken 15 years ago) I look awful now, and my Whippet on this site, it seems to cheer Sue up to see the pix of us. Ah so, dear Darlin' Sue!  You sound better, of course you are not the only Triple Neg, silly goose, there are tons of us. You are going to be an old lady and send flowers to my funeral.  So there, and then you will say, \"By golly, Shirlann was right!\"  I am going to be an old lady! See, that is what is going to happen. Now, if Fumi gets my Whippet's pix in, this is the story.  Whippets were bred first in ENGLAND for the poor people, since the wealthy would not let them have greyhounds, in fact, when the greyhounds were too old to hunt or race, they would cut their Achilles tendons so they could not be used by the poor folks.  Now, when they first began to come out in the poor neighborhoods of London, they were always Whippets, but also  called \"Snap Dogs\", since they took off so fast.  They can beat a greyhound in a short race.  SoOOOOO, (I am getting to the point) this is where the term \"WHIPPERSNAPPER\" came from as in, that little whippersnapper sure is fast! So that is from me today, to our precious Sue, who I hope is sound asleep. Hugs, Shirlann ",

I think the Deep Margins is a good thing, I think it means they are wide.  Different words, but that is what it sounds like. So go, make the dates, show up, gripe with us every day/evening and before you know it, we will be making Valentines!  It will go fast. So, love you Sweet Sue, XXXOOO Shirlann ",
