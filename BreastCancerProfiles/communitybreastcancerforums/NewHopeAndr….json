Have had weekly fills (hot, sore, \"bowling ball boob\") and started PT which is helping me get some range of motion back on left side.  Used pain meds at first, now off them - until next Weds.    I am apprehensive about exchange surgery, but on the plus side I hope I am getting it \"over with.\"  I am an anxious person so going through 4 months of neoadjuvent chemo and knowing the mastectomy was coming after, may have been harder for me personally than having it happen quickly.   I also have an autoimmune disease and needed to decide about silicone vs. saline.  My plastic surgeon uses silicone almost always.  I did some research and I decided I am OK with it, but if any of you have feedback, let me know.  All of us can support each other!  Best wishes to all of you!   AND ... one day at a time ....  Each day is a challenge but day by day, I am getting thru each phase.   And although I am polite, I don't allow myself to feel pressured by non cancer patients who apparently know how I should feel while going thru this (buck up!  positive attitude!)  I do feel better than I did 6 months ago while dealing with the initial shock, but never in a million years would tell someone what their feelings should be.   Sending best wishes to all of you",

      "Content": "Aug 31, 2013 10:06AM - edited Aug 31, 2013 10:26AM by NewHopeAndrea Hi, I want to send hugs and warm wishes to all of you!  I was diagnosed in late Feb, I just made my diagnosis and treatment info \"public\" so should show up below.  I just turned 53 and have 22 year old and 18 year old.  I felt early on that every test was more bad news and a ratcheting down of my future chances and life plans ... on top of which, as I'm sure many of you have experienced, people want you to \"buck up\" and have a positive attitude without really realizing what you are facing.   I hope to encourage myself and others on our mutual journeys.  Listing some negatives here but on the whole with chemo and mastectomy behind me, beginning to feel a little better.  Although the hormone therapy is now presenting some challenges.  It's so easy when you get through a challenge (and people say this, too) to believe that the worst is behind you at least for now.  As others have said, I believe (i) only other cancer patients seem to really \"get it\" and (ii) every person's case is different.  I recall clearly how daunting (close to impossible) it seemed to deal with at first.  Still daunting, but as humans do I have made some sort of an adjustment to it and just get through each phase as it comes.  In between I have tried to have some fun, so I remember what it feels like : ) yesterday I went parasailing which was on my bucket list.  Chemo was dose dense A/C then Taxol; it was tough.  Had various SE's including the \"usual\" nausea, exhaustion etc. plus hand-foot syndrome and pretty rigorous pain all over different parts of body with the Taxol.  Still experiencing some Taxol SE's including nail bed damage.  It is a huge relief to have chemo phase completed for now.  If this helps, it seemed like forever while doing it (days pass slowly, don't they?) - but now it's done, it doesn't seem so bad in retrospect.  Hair is growing back.  I was able to find good wigs, mastectomy products, vest to hold drains etc. though TLC and Gabor.  Lucky I was able to have sister, stepmom and gentleman friend help me with post surgical care, they are not squeamish.  I am having my exchange-for-permanent implant surgery next week then radiation.  Trying to feel \"up for it\", but not looking forward to post surgical pain, drain, etc.  However ... each step, you get through as it comes and hope for gradual improvement.  Also taking antidepressants, and sleep medicine.  Trying to eat healthier.  I am an energetic person so on top of the shock, fear etc. has been trying to adjust to my very limited ability to \"do stuff.\"  I have been fortunate to have strong family and \"gentleman friend\" support, and gradually as chemo has completed, talked to rads doctors and got mastectomy and ALND done, and am able to resume a little more of my past activities, my emotional state is in fact improving.  But this is a one day at a time thing!  I am going to work on getting back into some kind of circulation beyond my inner circle, as I am able.  Also will need to consider future employment and health insurance issues (on COBRA now).  Using Scarlett O'Hara (\"I'll think about that tomorrow\") strategy at the moment for things beyond a month from now.   Heh!  ",

      "Content": "Sep 12, 2013 09:50AM - edited Sep 12, 2013 10:02AM by NewHopeAndrea Good for you for being proactive with doctors.   I had port inserted and 4 mos. chemo before surgery. My surgery was 7/30.  I started PT 3 weeks later for lymphedema prevention and to restore range of motion and had 3 appts after my mastectomy & ALND and before my exchange.  It helped significantly and I really like the PT specialist.   Looking forward to getting back to it.  To all - yes. waiting for results is tough.  Distraction (to the extent possible) helped me - spending time with people, watching a movie, etc.  Got one body blow after another in March-April with each test, then found out after surgery that 5/14 nodes positive.  Of course I am worried.  There is necessary mental processing and grieving to do, while trying not to have fears and other tough feelings (anguish?) take over.  Be as nice to yourself as you can - I have found these forums to be a wonderful source of love and strength.  Thanks to all!",

      "Content": "Sep 1, 2013 03:42PM - edited Sep 1, 2013 03:56PM by NewHopeAndrea I would insist on seeing my doctor.  I am a former attorney so don't mind being politely assertive.  You have a right to see him/her especially if you are having problems.  SHould not in my opinion try to decide about TE removal without having an appointment with the doctor.  My plastic surgeon told me the dead skin thing could happen, but mine is healing ok.  I have TE since 7-31 and have had 3 fills.  Exchange next week.  It's hard, hot & uncomfortable.  I am on a  hurry-up schedule because have stage 3c and need to start rads.  Axillary lymph node site and the drains were the most painfu for me.  I have started PT which is helping with range of motion and making me feel better.  This is \"not fun\" but appears to me to be the easiest form of reconstruction I could get. Check with your doctor, but when I was deciding on options, I believe I was told that if I wanted implants, we needed to place the TE's at time of mastectomy.  If you are thinking about having TE's removed and do not get implant at that time (\"go flat\" as referred in other response), make sure you can still have the reconstruction technique of your choice later.  Because I am having radiation, my surgeon indicated that any form of reconstruction later would be more difficult because of the way the skin is affected by radiation.  Also, I could not do TRAM (not enough belly) and felt like the lat surgery would be much harder overall on my upper body with another major surgical site to heal, and scarring.  Also those surgeries are not guaranteed to be free of complications.   My friend had TRAM and had dead skin complications and needed revision, and her belly is not yet properly healed.  I understand being upset and fed up, only you can decide what is right for you. ",
