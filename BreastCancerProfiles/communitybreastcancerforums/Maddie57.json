Please let us know how it goes, so we can be prepared when we go in for the same thing. boobzilla - the worst thing you can do after surgery is not use that arm. It encourages LE and cording. The Macmillan cancer site encourages you to exercise as soon as you can - the day of surgery if possible, although not many people are able to do this. They have a regime of very gentle exercises for the first few weeks.  I was so terrified of cording, as I need my right arm for my work, I tried to do some exercises as soon as I came around. The lymph node mapping is done so they can remove the least number of nodes possible. They try and ascertain which lymph nodes your tumour will drain into first, and only remove those. Good luck - hope all goes well.",

I had my replacement surgery this week, so have been in hospital, but it all went well, and I feel so much better than the first time. It is a walk in the park compared to that! The surgeon has done a really good job from what I can see. He asked me what I thought of it, as he has tried really hard to match the implant to the real breast, and I think he was a bit hurt when I said I haven't really looked yet. To be fair it was covered with some huge plastic compression bandage, and I have found if you only look at it clinically for a week or two your subconscious works on the problem and you can face whatever you see later. mssunshine I am sure Ann is right about the tired chemo hair falling out. A few of mine did the same, but now I have a good covering. On the plus side when your eyelashes start coming in they come in dark and thickish which is super. They are still quite short but getting there, and I will be thrilled if they stay this colour. virginiab - hope you had a good post treatment holiday. I think it is normal to still require a little nap every once in a while. emilybrooke - how are the girls doing? Although I am still a bit sore and swollen I am thrilled to find the permanent implant feels more comfortable already. The port under my arm was really getting on my nerves.  Madelyn - big milestone - eyebrows threaded!! Let us know how your hair extensions go. Does anyone know how long you have to wait before you can colour your hair? I read 6 months somewhere. Is that 6 months from the last chemo, 6 months from the first sign of growth or 6 months from the time you have a full head covering? Keep well ladies Good luck with your chemo Susan - thinking of you",

I  must admit, I was rather dreading the 3rd one, as allergic reactions quite often get worse and not better with other drugs. Thought I would pass this tip along to all you lovely ladies in case you have also experienced this problem. I found my scalp was feeling really sore. It even hurt to move my head on the pillow. I read somewhere about Sweet Almond Oil. I put some on and let it soak in for a few hours, and then washed the few wisps of hair that are left, and guess what - it feels better already!!",

Are you on Herceptin? If so - this was the single most common effect of Herceptin. One lady asked everyone on our website to list their side effects from Herceptin and when they kicked in.You guessed it - the runny nose was common with nearly all of them!! Hi Roadwarrior - I am thrilled your first Taxotere treatment went well. My worst SE's started day 5/6 and I met a lady today who said her worst SE's also started on day 5. I am due for my third chemo treatment Monday . Unfortunately the neutrophil count was too low, so they are not sure if I can have it. I will have another blood test on Monday just before I start to recheck it, as the Onc says they often come up again. Here's hoping!! I am thrilled for those of you who have finished your Taxotere regime!! I am only half way through!!! ",

SusanHG - I have been told the Herceptin side effects are worse with the first treatment, and lessen with each subsequent one. I hope that holds true for you. I used to have to stay 2 hours after the herceptin to check for SE's but now they only wait half an hour which is great. Speeds the process up greatly. Re the hair. I met a lady in town the other day. She is 6 months post chemo, and her hair was 2inches/ 4.5cms long. It looked good, thick and shiny and was a proper hair style. She did say it had come out slightly curly whereas she had straight hair before, and had come out grey when it grew again. Does anyone know when you can colour your hair once it starts growing? My nails are still a normal colour, and I have not had to use nail polish as yet. I am not sure if all the oil I put on my TE is keeping them in good condition.  For those of you who have sold paintings, and had commissions. Well done!!  Melrose - thanks for the tip on the bras.

Mine came up so I could have the 3rd chemo. My Oncologist said there is really nothing you can do to encourage them, they just come up on their own. emilybrooke- that is harsh!!!! What a decision to make. Looking at your history it does seem a bit of overkill. I have great faith in the Herceptin which you appear to be on. An acquaintance was in stage 4 with no hope of a cure, but the Herceptin has really worked and she is 2 years  cancer free now. I also see they removed 10 nodes which is quite a few, and they were all clear. I would ask someone who has had radiation before you make this decision - maybe it will help you make up your mind. Good luck emily - let us know what you decide. teball mom - I am sorry you are having so many Taxol treatments. Are they giving you one a week to reduce the SE's? virginiaab - hope you get on your cruise - it sounds exactly what you need. I am also going away, and am packing when I have the strength.

I have had this once before BC, and the dentist asked me if I was eating a lot of fruit. I was at the time, as friends with fruit trees had given me lots which my family and I were all ploughing through. If it is just the one, and feels like the root - I would go ASAP to the dentist. You may have an infection, and timely antibiotics could sort it out without root canal treatment.  ",

What a useful and wonderful thing to do. You must be so proud of her. After every chemo my scalp itches like mad. Sweet almond oil helps a lot. Rub it in well - leave it on for a while, and then wash your bits of stubble. I still have a bit of stubble - thicker at the neck like Boobzilla, but after each chemo a little more stubble falls out . We go on holiday in a weeks time, and when I get back I am shaving it all off, so I can have the joy of seeing my peach fuzz appear!  Boobzilla - sorry about your bronchitis - I am glad to hear you are a little better  Take care all - have a good week. ",

Chemo drugs affect everyone differently. Look at Susan and Madelyn. Susan has found Taxotere harder than AC, and Madelyn seems to have done much better on Taxotere. The decision to work or not to work was taken out of my hands by my oncologist. I work in a hospital, and she said I couldn't work because of the risk of infection. I could maybe have worked the 3rd week post chemo, but it is a good thing the Onc told me I couldn't, as with my second Taxotere at the 3 week mark when my white cells should have been at their highest, they were only 0.65. I would have been in serious trouble coming into contact with patients!! Tell your boss you will see how you manage before committing yourself to working, throughout the treatment. I don't think the gym is a great idea. The place must be swarming with germs with all those people sweating and breathing hard. I had horrible SE's with Taxotere, but I wish you minimal SE's. Susan- I have long suspected that you are driving yourself too hard. I had the same work ethic. My motto was \"Get up, get going and get over it\"!! Unfortunately this time it didn't work. Please be kinder to yourself more often and take some time off sick - your body needs time to heal. I am glad you are at peace with your decision about the breast. It is hard I know - big hugs!

It went well, but I felt like the new girl at school. Couldn't seem to remember anything. By Wednesday I was totally finished and threw a bit of a wobbly - shivery and feverish, but it settled down, and next week should be better. It was lovely to see all my colleagues back at work. I had some wonderful news on Friday, and wanted to share it with you all. My BS told me I could only have the permanent implant put in after chemo had finished. I thought that included Herceptin, although I know it is a targeted therapy and not strictly a chemo drug. Anyway it appears I can have the surgery on Herceptin, so if I have the operation whilst on Herceptin I will be totally finished with all the treatments in July instead of October. The TE is also so uncomfortable, I will be glad to exchange it for the real implant. I could have skipped out of there!! PA eagles - love your hair story. I keep looking at my stubble.

I am getting small sores, because my scalp is sooo itchy, even though I am putting oil on it. I can't resist scratching- I try and try not to scratch and then I just have to, and the relief is blissful. I feel like Baloo the bear in Jungle Book- I'm sure you remember the song \"Bare Necessities\"!!  A friend sent me this, and it is our hair growth in a nut shell, and what we can realistically expect- Chemo has an effect on the hair as the 2 fastest growing cell actions in the body are the growth of the cancer and growth of the hair and as the chemo has the greatest impact on the fastest growing cells, the hair is automaically affected by the treatment as is the cancer. Consequently the hair falls out from the bulbous follicle at it's source. Naturally this is the furthest depth of the hair in the skin and when it starts growing it has to start again from this point. Therefore it can take about 6-8 weeks to appear on the surface. After this, it will grow at just over 1 cm per month, so within a couple of months, i.e. at about 3 - 4 months in total, there should be a very noticeable covering. I have bought some Revitalash to encourage my eyelashes. I will let you know if it was worth the money, as it is pretty expensive. One of the reviews however was from a chemo sufferer, and she said it was great. It takes a few weeks for the effects to be noticeable. The back of the box advises you not use it unless you have finished chemo therapy.",

Whilst on holiday in the Greek Isles I broke a tooth in half on an olive pip. I'm beginning to feel like Job in the bible!! Anyway to cut a long story short I had to do something about it, as one half fell out the next day. A Greek dentist fixed my tooth. He said you can have dental treatment whilst on chemo. I contacted my own dentist who is a personal friend and a fantastic dentist, and he said the only contra indication to dental treatment is a temperature, or radiotherapy to the head and neck. Hope this helps with your dental crown issue.I know it is probably not high on your agenda at the moment, but if the broken crown is a front tooth it will make you feel better. I agree with you about the hair issue. \"All I want for Christmas...\" Well it's not my two front teeth, but a bit of hair.",

Pretend you are checking a patient for signs of infection, and then put your clothes on. Remember you are a work in progress! Your mind adjusts after a few months, and it gets easier to accept, and to look. The reconstructed breasts do not look like real breasts, and once you accept that it also makes it easier to adjust and have realistic goals. I had immediate reconstruction with a tissue expander. It is painful for a month, but the degree of pain seems to depend on how slim you are. The BRAVA method may be an option for you on your irradiated side. Dr Khouri does it, and makes your breast entirely from your own fat tissue. It is a long procedure though, as it seems you have to wear some weird plastic suction cup to stretch the skin. Once finished though,it looks and feels as close to a real breast as you are going to get. Keep strong- if there is anything you want to ask me about the reconstruction process - fire away. I go for the permanent implant in the middle of January. Ann - I LOVE cheesecake - sounds delicious. Roadwarrior- I am trying Nutrilash which also seems to be natural. Someone on the website recommended it.  Virginialab - thanks for the hair and eyelash update. It gives me some sort of realistic timel line to aim for.",

Some people manage fine without the Neulasta injection, but the one time I didn't have it, my white cells dropped alarmingly. Are you sure the excruciating bone pains are from the Neulasta? I also had the bone pains - some from the neulasta, but the crippling ones were from the Taxotere. Taxol is very similar. The oncologist reduced my dose, and gave me hydrocortisone before every Taxotere infusion, and this hepled unbelievably!!!",

Thanks for the tip on the No-No for hair removal. I did shave mine off, but if it comes back i will get one. Ann - I'm sorry you are experiencing a lot of pain. I also had a lot of pain after the mastectomy. I think we feel pain in the armpit more, as that is one of the areas the nerves are still intact. It starts easing off after about 4 weeks. Several of you have asked about Susan. I was also worried about her, and so searched for her onthe threads. She has joined the taxotere side effects thread now, as they changed her medication from taxol to taxotere",

Maybe later, but at the moment I think - grow just grow!!  Susan - the texture of your hair will be different when it gets going. It will syay a little coarser and thicker forever I think. Some of that is because grey hair is coarser and thicker than normal hair. At about 4 months post chemo I noticed it definitely felt a lot softer and it has got gradually softer ever since. The texture is now quite good, and I like it thicker. I had very silky hair before which was great to touch, but got flat really quickly. I am 7 months post chemo and my hair is now about 2 inches long. Your hair grows more slowly in winter than summer, so if the weather would finally warm up, we may see an increase in the growth rate.I am definitely not Rapunzel, but it is not obvious I have had cancer. Other cancer sufferers have reported they lost their curls about 15 months post chemo, but some seem to have kept the curls, so I guess we will have to wait and see about our own curls! I am not wearing a LE sleeve, as I am lucky enough not to have developed LE yet. Hang in there - the pirates will be running their fingers through your golden locks soon.",

The injection is subcutaneous so stings slightly, but after what we have been through it is a walk in the park. Sentinel means \"Guardian\" ie you sentinel node is the doorkeeper to your lymphatic chain. Unfortunately lymph doesn't travel in a straight line, so it is difficult to see which are the first nodes your tumour drain to. There are several lymphatic chains they may drain into. They inject the isotope in the affected quadrant of the breast. It take several hours for the nodes to pick up the isotope, so they do it a few hours before your operation. When you are in theatre they have a small pen- like geiger counter device, and this picks up the radioactive reading from your sentinel node. Whilst you are in theatre they will also inject methalin blue. This drains almost instantly to your sentinel node. Between the blue colour, and the radioactive reading, they have a good idea of your guardian node. As you do not have a tumour that they know of in that breast, they may give several injections to cover all the quadrants. I am guessing however that they will probably just check the axillary chain of nodes. Not long to go now until your operation. Thinking of you.",

That really upset me for a while, but I got over the fear quickly after the first 2 swims.

I am sure they will match perfectly and it will all be worth it. I thought about it, but I have had a unilateral mastectomy, and nothing is going to match these boobs!!! They look so different.

Couldn't bear the thought of it all dropping out again. Glad to hear your radiation is now finished- you can tick that one off your list! I was doing fine, but had some glitch last week. I felt so awful I had to go to the Dr. I was given antibiotics, but they gave me severe thrush within a day. I also picked up a bladder infection, so am on another lot of antibiotics. Other than that am doing really well, and have also ditched the wig! I contacted SusanHG123, as I was worried about her, she is having a truly terrible time on the Taxotere.

I have even gone from very rarely wearing foundation to wearing it all the time. On this web we can be brutally honest, so I will tell you all the thought processes I went through before deciding not to have the mastoplexy. I tried really hard to find someone who had a unilateral mastectomy with TE implant to get some advice, but despite my best efforts most people have had a bilateral mastectomy or a lumpectomy or were at a different stage of reconstruction. I did find someone who had the mastoplexy, but it only lasted 2 years. She has had the procedure twice in 5 years, and says she needs it done again, but the PS has refused to do it again or even see her. So the lift does not last forever. The second important point is - there is a loss of sensation, so instead of one numb breast there is a good chance you will have two numb breasts. The fact that you had a lumpectomy may work in your favour and maybe the breasts  will match up and drop together naturally. I went on the photo web shop, and realised that with the TE construction no matter what I did they would never look the same. My DH said he would rather have one natural breast, and I was perfect as I was!! He didn't want me to have to go through unnecessary surgery. The most important point I considered, was if I got BC in the other breast I would have gone through all that for nothing!! Everyone is different, but be happy with your decision. Discuss the pros and cons with your PS and see what he says. I have found you have to wear moulded cups. They stand alone like sentinels, so you can have hollow spots all over the place, and you can't see the difference when you wear clothes! I found some really good swim wear that is very forgiving in the matter of unequal breasts. They are called Nicolajane, and I was thrilled with the tankini I ordered. It is even comfortable to wear, and that is saying something. Good luck with your decision.",

I had a major reaction to the Taxotere 6 days after the first chemo. Because of the time delay the Oncologist was not sure what had caused the reaction. On the second chemo the allergic reaction started straight away and they had to stop to give me a cortisone injection before we could continue. At least I now know it is the Taxotere causing the problems. I am rambling on a bit, but apart from the other allergic reactions I now know the reaction I get from my TE is not encapsulation but some sort of side effect to the chemo. It started almost immediately with the other reactions this time. The tissue over the TE clamps down really hard. It is so tight if I move my arm too much the whole implant buckles as there is not enough room for it to move. If I bend down the whole TE sucks in to make really big dents and corrugations. This lasts about 6 days before it starts easing off. It is really distressing and uncomfortable. Have any of you had this reaction? If so have you found anything that helps? I would really appreciate your help",

When I had my hysterectomy I developed a heat rash it was so bad, so really feel for you with that. I was on HRT before this, and that is probably why I am also sweating - withdrawal symptoms. Good luck on Wednesday - hope it goes really well. I didn't really get restless legs - it attacked my joints. The first reaction was 6 days after chemo- the second time immediately. The first time was an incredible throb right through my back to my sternum. The throb and pain was so bad I thought I was having a heart attack, as the pain went right through my heart. Morphine did not touch it, and I whimpered for 12 hours. It moved to other joints then - lumbar spine, hips etc and I could hardly walk. This gradually wore off after 24 hours.The second time it started within 2 mins, and I wasn't expecting it. It felt like somone had dropped a steel girder on my lap. I literally couldn't move - I was pinned to the seat with the pain. I started going a bright shade of red - quite spectacular my sister tells me!! Anyway the cortisone injection they gave me really helped, so here's hoping.... On the bright side - any other SE's I get pale in comparison - the terrible thrush, nosebleeds etc. They are really just a minor irritation in comparison, and don't bother me at all.  Lifeonit - you will probably find the low back pain you get is your lumbar spine. I have worked out the chemo seems to target any problems you have ever had in your joints - like a seek and destroy mission!! You mentioned you were a dancer, so you may have minor degenerative changes there which you have not noticed but the Taxol/taxotere has!",

My fingers and toes are now almost permanently slightly numb right at the ends whereas before it came and went. Can't say it is sore - just weird. I have read the runny nose is caused by the hairs thinning in your nose, and the runny eyes are because of the eyelashes thinning. Apparently if you use an earbud, and coat the inside of your nose with vaseline it stops the allergen touching the mucous membranes. Some hayfever sufferers also coat the eyelash line. Hope this helps you. Ann - you will always have bloods taken before your chemo. It's a wonder we have any blood left!! They have to check your platelets and white cells etc are normal enough for your body to withstand a dose of chemo. If they didn't do this the chemo dose could kill you or make you seriously ill. Roadwarrior- as you have done so well on the AC I am sure you will do equally well on the Taxol. Most of us who have suffered with Taxol or Tamoxifen seem to have suffered with terrible joint pains. You look young and gorgeous, and I don't think this will be an issue for you. The neuropathy is a different matter. I only have it very slightly so far - not enough to worry me as I told Stride- maybe it will get worse I don't know. We are all so different. I wish I could be there for your first treatment to give you some support. My sister goes with me for my chemo treatments- is there anyone to go with you? Let us know how it goes- big hug !!!",

For my second treatment where I did not have the Neulasta injection my neutrophils had dropped to 0.65 so they thought they may not be able to give me my 3rd chemo. Luckily they came up to 13.5 in 2 days so was able to have it. I still think that sounds a bit weird - makes me wonder if they made a mistake- but if you can stick it I think the Neulasta is a good idea. Don't you hate the steroids the night before chemo. They make me break into a sweat every half an hour, and give me such a stomach ache. Boy will I be glad to drop those. Have any of you had any luck with bras? I am now wearing something I think my Grandmother may have worn. I have to stuff both cups in different places to make the breasts equal shape and size. Have just had a new wig delivered - it is just a half one, and you wear it with a hat or cap - it seems much more comfortable. I felt like a sheep dog in the other one!

It feels just like a particularly itchy horse blanket and is so hot. I am also tired of looking sideways at anyone who sneezes or coughs. My last Taxotere chemo is on Monday, and I think I would go crazy if I had to postpone it due to illness. My husband and I have booked to go to the Greek Isles 10 days after the last taxotere treatment. It is probably not the wisest thing to do with all the bugs on the aeroplane, but I am taking all the precautions I can, and can't wait to get away. Stride and Ann- I also have found I can't do much physical exercise, and I was thrilled to hear quite a few of you have found you are breathless. I thought it was only me. brKaren4 - Welcome!!!! So nice to meet(?) you. I have found our thread invaluable, and hope it helps you too. Roadwarrior and SusanHG123. I am so sorry about your SE's. Ask your Oncologist if they can reduce your dose a bit - it REALLY helps. Roadwarrior you may find you are developing an allergy to the Taxotere. If so, it will hit you as soon as they start the next drip. I have to have hydrocortisone before every treatment now, and I can tolerate the taxotere fairly well. The second treatment I was pinned to the chair within 2 minutes. The pain was so bad in my pelvis, hips and legs, I don't think I could have moved if there had been a fire. Susan I do hope your pneumonia is better - thinking of you. teeballmom - I am sorry the echocardiogram freaked you out. You will  have those fairly regularly now, as the herceptin can affect your heart muscle. They are just being careful. I hope your results are good. Earlier in this thread someone asked about nail discolouration. It hasn't changed the colour of the nail that is already there, but this week the nails obviously grew a bit, and the discolouration is at the base of the nails- oh the joys! ",

Thrilled to hear so many of you are close to the end. I had my first Herceptin on it's own on Tuesday. I was not expecting any SE's but found I could not keep my eyes open when I got home. My arms and legs were so tired I could hardly pick them up the whole day. Has anyone else experienced this? It could be our long plane journey kicking in, but it suddenly occurred to me that the reason I experienced the exhaustion this treatment is that I am no longer on steroids?  PA eagles - I am sorry you are finding the radiation treatment exhausting. It must be really tiring driving there everyday. Whaever- a 3 hour insertion - that's awful - sheer incompetence!!! I would also rearrange his gorgeous face. Removing it will be a lot easier. I had to laugh about your conversations with the eyebrows and eyelashes. I have been doing the same thing. I had my last taxotere treatment 3 weeks ago. I can't notice any hair growth yet, but please tell me the eyebrows and eyelashes will not continue to fall out! I seem to remember I read somewhere, one BC patient's hair started growing back but then all her eyebrows and eyelashes fell out. That seems really cruel! Virginia- was it you who was planning on booking a nice cruise? Hope you managed to find one you were happy with.",

We are the same - I think we put all our energy into getting through the chemo, and not worrying our family and friends and when it is finished we have time to mourn and reflect on what we have lost. Unfortunately my family and friends all think it is over when the chemo is finished, but I realised my life is never going to be the way it was before BC. I am working through it slowly, and coming to terms with it all. Our lives will never be the same, but it is life, albeit a different kind of life, and it can also be good. Peace and big hugs to you. skimommi - the neulasta injection works well, but your counts go up and down. My counts were the lowest once when they should have been at their highest. It was the one cycle though that I didn't have the neulasta injection. Always be aware of germs without being paranoid, and don't let anyone near you who is sick. Theoretically - you counts are lowest days 7-9.  Oh be careful handling money. It is full of germs. If I am not mistaken I read that is how the saying \"Filthy Lucre\" came about. Good luck with your chemo. Hope it goes really well for you. It was my first day back at work today. I am on phased return, so do reduced hours for a month - gradually building them up. It felt like my first day at school! Anyway my colleagues were very kind, and are easing me into everything gradually. emilybrooke - have you made your final decision yet? ",

I still have slightly swollen feet an ankles, and pitting oedema in my fingers. I am 6 weeks post chemo now and when I mentioned it to my oncologist, she said it was still very early days, but that it would get better. Life - hope you had a great party. I loved your blog by the way - you write beautifully Susan - there is a thread on here for BC sufferers who have not had reconstruction. I am sure they will be able to help you. I have read your recovery time post surgery will be quicker- no consolation I know- but still nice to hear. I had reconstruction with TE's, but I should imagine the period of time for drains should be similar. The time period depends on your bleeding. I had 3 drains. One came out after 2 days, one came out on the third day, and one drain would not stop bleeding!! That one took 6 days. My physio gave me a waterproof draw string bag for the drains. It was great, as I could put all three of them inside the bag, and lay it on the mattress next to me. It was also great for showering, as I could just wipe it off afterwards, and when I went for a walk around the hospital I carried it like a handbag.  MY BS was very particular about driving post surgery, and he said no driving for 6 weeks, although some surgeons say 4 weeks. I was given a booklet by Macmillan cancer support on exercise  post surgery to prevent cording and a frozen shoulder. They suggested you do these one day after surgery, or the same day if you could manage it. Your hospital should have a section with breast cancer pamphlets. You will find them in there.  Ann - I am so thrilled with your good news. Congratulations!!! Virginiab - great news about the new eyelashes.  Maybe we should mention this new morse code to the CIA and MI6. I am now 6 weeks post chemo - I still had a few eyelashes and eyebrows- but my eyelashes and eyebrows still seem to be coming out. Did this happen to you? I was hoping I wouldn't lose them completely now I have stopped chemo. Roadwarrior - I remember you also had trouble with one foot during chemo. The pain has gone completely now, but I seem to get a lot of cramp in that foot. I am usually not a person who gets cramp. Have you found the same thing?",

If you do decide to leave the oil in overnight, I suggest you cover your pillow, as it will leave a greasy mark. The recipe did say one is supposed to apply the oil everyday, but I could not be bothered with this \u2013 just try and do it at least twice a week.   The initial cost seems quite high, but the herbal oils will last for years, as one only uses a few drops at a time. Grape Seed oil is available at Health shops, but if you look in the cooking oils section of your local supermarket you may find it there for a lot cheaper. If you use this Grape Seed oil \u2013 add 2 mls of vitamin E oil to the mixture.  ",

Do you think the Taxotere and the length of time you took it has contributed to your heart taking a bit of a beating from the Herceptin? You must have had quite a few  Herceptin already, or did they only start recently. I had my Herceptin with my chemo. I have only 3 left now, and then will have had 17. I can't wait to finish. I thought Femara was a hormone suppressant - may be wrong about this, so am surprised you have lost your hair again. Poor you!!! I really feel for you losing your darling daughter. 600 miles is such a long way away. Hang in there- thinking of you always! I have not had my nipples done, so can't comment on the tattoos. If anyone else has had them done, would also be interested to know. Susan - don't you go for your reconstruction in June. Will this delay your surgery? ",

If my hair reverts to being like it used to be, a short hair cut is not for me- I would look like a street urchin. It would just stick to my head!!!! Being bald or having short hair is very liberating -time wise. As you say hair takes a lot of maintenance. I am also not sure if I like mine so curly, but on the plus side, it stays where you put it, and I am soooo glad to have hair. I am serious - if I brush it back, it stays back. My old hair would never have done that, and I LOVE that side of it. Has anyone else found that with the new hair. Feeling the magic- my hair is still slow and steady, but my blooming eyelashes are thinning AGAIN!!! One of the chemo side effects people would pay for, is not having to shave one's legs or armpits.  Wow you ladies are all doing so well physically - running, walking and going to gym. I am still very tired sometimes, and have not got back to full fitness. I finished my herceptin last week, and I am pretty sure that had a lot to do with it, so hope I start picking up a bit physically.  I think we have all changed emotionally.  I cherish my friends and family, and find myself chocked with tears if something is particularly beautiful- flowers, scenery, music etc. It is like being pregnant!!! I used to howl over some of the fairy stories I read to my sons. I had to stop reading them for a while. Wept for an hour over \"The little match girl\", various dog stories and \" Charlotte's web\". I sometimes wonder about children's books- they are so dark sometimes. I also try not to rush around so much. So what if I am 5 minutes late. Thinking of you all.",

Hopefully it won't be so painful this time, as the skin may be stretched from the short time you did have it in? My hair is also not growing fast, but is really thick. I gauge it by my leg and pubic hairs. If they thin or stop growing I know my hair is going to slow down for a while. It seems to grow in cycles. I have coloured my hair, though not platinum blonde, and it took okay. You just have to use a really good creamy moisturiser as it does tend to get dry. You will also have to colour only the roots when you recolour, and not the whole head or you hair will dry and split. You sem to be on a long cycle of herceptin. I took it for a year, and I think the herceptin slows the hair growth a bit. How long have you been taking it? Live2Laugh - that is terrible news. I am sooo sorry. I hope it turns out to be something else and not MS. Could it be a muscle disorder caused by the Tax, as I still have terrible trouble with my leg muscles and ankles. Pain and cramp.

As I said make sure you are on your own - it is not easy to really let go if there is someone else there. The breast clinic sister has said she has never seen me cry and I don't usually let it get me down, but I did have one really, really bad day when the BS told me the skin over the TE was so thin I would not be able to do any exercise for at least a year. This line from a song always made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck even before any of this happened - \"The wolves they howled for my lost soul, I fell into a big black hole...\". Boy did that describe how I felt that day, and I sobbed from the bottom of my boots on and off all day. I felt much better the next day!! If you can leave an abusive relationship you are one strong woman - you can get through this. Ann and teeballmom  - have you tried Evening Primrose Oil for the menopausal symptoms? I have heard it helps, but check with your Onc first, as I am not sure if it contains Estrogen. PAeaglesfan- thanks for the good wishes. I am on premeds for chemo. Guess they will just have to be a bit stronger for the 3rd one. With regards 4 or 6 chemos it is a difficult choice. It depends on your risk of spread. I had 2 tumours, but apparently as my sentinel nodes were clear  my risk of spread is small. I have only been offered 4 chemo treatments, but will be on herceptin for a year. I think I  am happy with 4 as a precaution.",

I had my third taxoter treatment on Monday and they gave me hydrocortisone before they started, as i am allergic to the stuff. It really helped - I wasn't pinned to the seat with pain. Only one more to go - yeah!!  I have had 1 treatment without Neulasta and 2 without, so may be able to answer some of your questions - although we are all different. My personal experience is that the joint pain from the Neurlasta is not as bad. It seems to hit the long bones and the hips a bit. It also makes your bones feel quivery - if you know what I mean. It seems to kick in the day after the injection. The Taxotere pains were much more severe with me and seem to kick in 5/6 days after treatment. It seems to affect your sternum,  whole back including your neck and hips. It also hits the wrists and hands. Road warrior - your pains sound like the Taxotere pain. With my first Taxotere treatment,morphine every 2 hours did not touch the pain, but at 3 am a little nurse came in and said - I know this will sound strange when the morphine is not working too well but I am bringing you a heat pad and 2 paracetamol. Well guess what ladies - that worked better than anything - so for those of you with back pain try lying on a heat pad. Hope it works! The numb with the toes comes and goes I find. The fingers started going numb from the 2nd treatment but are still not too bad. if any of you are suffering terribly with SE's - tell your Oncologist. They may be able to lower the dose, and this helps unbelievably. I am sorry to hear about all the insurance woes - hope they are all sorted out. Good luck ladies",

As my other chemo buddies have said -once you are through it, it seems to have gone quickly, and fades into a bad dream. Two things I would not be without, and would buy before I started - a heating pad for sore joints, and diaper cream for burnt \"nether regions\". Oh yes, and vaseline and cotton wool buds for your nose - it will drip a lot. Just gently rub around your nostrils with a cottonwool bud. Thinking of you and sending healing thoughts. Are any of you going for permanent implants soon to replace the TE's? I hope to go at the end of January and can't wait to get these TE's out. Have any of you has a unilateral mastectomy? If so - are you having a mastoplexy to match up to \"Little Miss Barbie Boob\" ?",

I can't even imagine thinking about another round of chemo in January.  emilybrooke - thanks so much for reporting back about the exchange surgery. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it doesn't sound nearly as bad as the mastectomy and TE. Itsalltempo - I am now 9 weeks post chemo - go for another herceptin infusion tomorrow- but my hair does not seem as advanced as yours. I couldn't possibly go without a scarf or wig yet, although I would love to. I have dark hair growing in a fringe at the crown of my head, but am still fairly bald at the front and around the ears. If I look with the light behind me, I can see the faintest bit of fuzz. In fact I look a bit like a shaved \"Woodie Woodpecker\"! My leg hairs, armpit hairs , and nether regions are starting to grow a bit, but my eyelashes and eyebrows are still falling out which is irritating!! I know what you mean about the energy levels. I start off fairly chipper, but if I do too much, the weakness comes over me like a wave. These waves are getting farther and farther apart though, so I am getting stronger bit by bit. Madelyn - I do hope you are over your bronchitis. Good luck with the radiation treatment. Have any of you noticed that your body's temperature control seems completely out of whack. The smallest drop in temperature, and I am shivering like a kitten. If the temperature comes up at all I start sweating. I have developed a strong bladder at night. If I get up to go to the toilet which is really close, my teeth start chattering so much I am scared of breaking a tooth!",

I did wonder about swopping the Taxol to Taxotere for the bone pain, as taxotere is known to be worse in that regard. On the plus side I read it is slightly more effective than taxol. The heating pad is the best thing for the bone pain. Lie down, and put the pad under the painful part of your body. mambr - I know what you mean about finishing the reconstruction surgery. It is a big decision deciding when to do it. I made the decision to have it before I finished the herceptin. It was hard having surgery one week, and the drip a week later. I thought when the herceptin was due \"I don't want to do this now\", but I will be all finished in July when the herceptin is completed. The surgery was a breeze compared to the mastectomy, and it feels more comfortable already than the TE's. Do you have TE's?",

My darling sister who has been so fantastic throughout this whole thing really hurt me by saying - \"Now you are just looking for something\". I didn't know what to say at first - it seemed so unfair. Eventually I said - of course I had to see the Dr - I can't ignore a frequently recurring stabbing pain!!! I still feel so hurt about the remark- do you think I am being foolish. For those of you who had the TE for reconstruction. Do you know the life span of these TE's. I have to decide whether to have a nipple at some point. My PS reconstructs the nipple, and then they tatooo on the areola. What happens when these TE's have to be replaced? The nipple and tatoo are then going to look mighty queer once they have slashed?!!! SusanHG123 - how are you doing? Haven't heard from you for a while.",

An MRI showed up some suspicious lesions on my spine a few months ago which really freaked me out for a few days. A CT and bone scan were negative. Due to the small size and location a biopsy was not possible, so go for another MRI at the end of June to see if they have grown. If they remain the same size they are some benign lesion. I am putting it out of my mind until then, and trying to ignore any stabbing pains from anywhere. Do you experience these bizarre little stabbing pains?

I was wearing a mastectomy tankini. The lady wanted me to take my top off. Even before this, I do not go topless on the beach. The only people who have seen my breasts are my husband, and now every Tom, Dick and Harry in the medical profession. Anyway there was no way I was taking off my top to show the whole crowded beach my mutilated nippleless chest. Would have given them a horrible shock. She was so insistent, that I tried miming the fact that I had a mastectomy. Much chopping motions with the hand over the chest! She did not understand my excellent mime. I then tried drawing a one boob chest in the sand. No luck! I thought to hell with this and gave it up as a bad job. I just pulled my top up a bit and lay down, and she had to get on with the bits she could reach! mssunshine the implants are so much more comfortable than the tissue expanders. I am so glad it went well.",

So nice to hear you are well FeelingtheMagic. I am so glad your lymph node biopsy was okay. That must have scared you ! The waiting is terrible- the worst bit.

It may be just an infected milk duct or a papilloma - a benign growth in the milk duct- but it definitely needs checking. Please see your Dr on Monday - they may need to do a mammogram. Don't freak out - they are just being careful. Conversely - don't be fobbed off - this needs checking. Don't worry until you know there is something to worry about!!! Big hugs.",

As the other ladies have said it is the nerves regenerating. The nerves further away from the scar obviously regenerate more quickly. The pains there will probably change over time from a sharp zinging pain to a weird sensitive pins and needles feeling if  any clothing rubs on the area. A bra seems to catch a nerve at the edge of one's armpit after a while. This pain/feeling changes over time, and the good news for your wife is that she will probably get some feeling back there in a few months. If the area gets red or swollen then you need to see the Dr.",
