    "Content": "bigallilsyd wrote: I had a painful area on my right breast develop along with some lumps last fall and I mentioned to my ob/gyn who referred me for an ultrasound.  Had that in Dec. and they wanted to do a mammogram as well since I was 35 - saw a small lump, but wanted to wait 6 months as I hadn't had a mammogram before and this was my baseline, I guess.  So went today just for another ultrasound, 6 months later and they wanted to do a mammogram after the radiologist saw the u/s.  Now I am scheduled for an MRI as soon as I get back from vacation in two weeks where I get an IV with dye or something in it??  I would really like any information anyone has one this that has been through it - the radiologist said I have only a 20% chance of it coming back malignant then would go for a biopsy if it is...I am in foreign territory here and would love some feedback.  How am I supposed to not think about this on vacation?
