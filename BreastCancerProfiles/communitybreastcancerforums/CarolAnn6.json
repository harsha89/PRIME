I still have very limited range in motion with my arm. Hurts to fully extend. Not able to raise my arm over my head. Have numbing from back of elbow up to back shoulder area. It is a mixture of numb and soreness. The cording is my biggest concern. I do the stretching exercises every day and the cording never let's me get past a certain spot. I met with a great new MO (did not connect with the first one). She spent 90 minutes with me. She shared the importance of a balanced life and how stress can damage. I have been running ragged for years. She said it was time for me to get re-fueled. Ask for help, don't play super-Mom to children and work and DH. she told me to lower my estrogen+ foods and take time for me....yoga, walk, reading a book....whatever I needed to de-stress. She gave me permission to not have to do it all. I heard her and cried during most of the appointment. She put me on Tamoxifen - she said that Chemotherapy would not help me. My oncotypeDX score came back at 9 and that my cancer cells like to hunker down and grow very slowly. She shared with me the SE's of Tamoxifen. I cried most at this point. She said to give it six months and stay positive. She mentioned that most damaging is stress and that i needed to have fun again. I have gotten so serious lately. My personality is that I take care of everyone - she told me to call on my sisters, friends, family to help out. She also asked me to take a leave of absence at work or could I quit - go part time? I am going to lower my hours at work and not be superwoman at work either. I feel like this is a very open journal right now....I'm sad that I still hurt with TE, numbness, soreness, and lack of arm movement. No physical fun at this time. I am 47 and still young. I was asked by my wonderful MO to refuel for the next five years while on tamoxifen and then to be around till I'm 80 or older. I am going to follow her orders. Thank you for letting me share -",

My family and DH tell me I should be happy.  No node involvement, should see low Oncotype score, no need for radiation.. I should be happy.  Why am I looking at my right healthy breast with a suspious eye.  Please take my messy thoughts, actually you already have. ",

I have been doing gentle excersises and there was a pain in my arm - inner elbow, armpit and down to wrist. I can't straighten out my arm. Yesterday, when I met with PS, he confirmed. He is sending me to Physical Therapy. Part of me wants to leave it alone and baby it forever - the other part of me say \"suck it up\" and do the painful PT. I have found lymphdema therapists in my area, but none are with my insurance. So, $85 out of my pocket each visit. I do not have lymphedema - I have cording....don't want to mess and make worse.",

I have really needed to read all the posts - it has been very helpful.    Carol Ann",

Still thinking about Tamoxifin - I have the prescription, but need my Oncotype score back before I take.  We have to rule in or rule out Chemo first.  I am taking one day at a time.  Working from home only... I have a sales gig that will allow that - but, I do need to get back into the office soon.  Taking a shower and getting dressed are still difficult.

I am proud to say that I just cleaned out my skin care products and my kitchen pantry is next. My MO motivated me to treat my body in a different way. Plus, the pain of surgery is still fresh.

Three month check in and she feels a lump in my remaining right breast. My left one still has TE and I am waiting to schedule exchange. I had a mammo yesterday after the MO meeting and now I am waiting on test results. I am going to chop her off if they say I have to go in for a biopsy. I told her not to turn on me....now she has a lump. I don't know where to post this. I am keeping this from my DH and everyone. Do not want to put everyone thru this again. Just a lump, just a test, just another f'en waiting session again. I will put on a smile and go make oatmeal and eggs in the morning. I will say everything is fine and get back to work. I will hang in there until it is time to make and serve dinner. I'm mad, bitter and angry that I am in the waiting game again so soon. Why... Was I that unhealthy? Did I lead that stressfull of a life? I thought by not reading and posting on these boards I was done with cancer. One word...lump...brings it all back.",
