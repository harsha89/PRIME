How long did the surgery took? Did your pathology report for sentinel node biopsy been released? To allay fear of my surgery, my nurse carer mentioned that my BS and PS team have handled hundreds of breast cases and that breast recon is an almost everyday scenario in the hospital. As she said, \" Put your trust in the treatment/doctors. Just think about yourself getting better. Eat nutritious food. Boost your immune system. We are all here for you.\"  ",

      "Content": "May 22, 2012 04:28AM - edited May 22, 2012 10:39AM by PixieNel hi dears, I just got discharged today after my last drain was removed. The surgery went fine. It was like longer than i thought. Since i was having tRam flap procedure, i was wheelled in @8am and woke up around 1045pm at High Depedency Unit. I did get a good sleep after waking up. Suddenly, I  have to cough up phlegm and thats where the unimaginable pain from my tummy incision flares up. No amount of morphine painkillers will stop the pain. It just makes me groggy and weak. The funny thing about my surgery that was brought forward to an earlier date. My surgeon forgot to mention beforehand that they have to take a vein from my left leg for additional blood supply to the relocated Tra muscle. He just mentioned it only a night before the surgery. Well, anyway the surgery pushed through and I have 5 drains attached. One on the left leg, 2 from the abdomen and 2 from my right breast. The left leg drain was removed the very next day. Actually all the 3 parts of my body are numb but when I coughed, it sorts of anger the tummy incision. That was the most pain i have.Then i have this IV antibiotic drip that has sort of clog the needle to my vein and they have to transfer the needle to another vein. I still feel groggy.  The next day, I was told by my doctor to sit up to prevent chronic lung infection and thrombosis in the legs and definitely, the backache from lying down for two days. So, I muster my courage and requested the nurse to let me sit up . As i am in a jackknife position of lying down. They have to teach me how to roll out on the bed using my left arm. and transfer to the recliner just beside it.I really had the support of 3 nurses to do this stunt. When I sat down and i was about to cough again, the sitting position gives me a relief as it compresses the wound. After i got the experience of sitting up, i simply dont want to return to lying position.For the pain medication, i just requested for oral painkillers since morphine has no effect on me. From high dependency unit to normal ward for me on that evening, I'm a bit scared coz it feels like my body cannot do anything except lying and sitting down.  Day 2 post op: I felt I am getting better esp for my tummy part. But my right chest is numb and heavy. After i woke up, I immediately sat down. They aided me in my walking to the bathroom and gave me a warm shower. That has improve a lot in my blood circulation. The numbness on my shoulder has tone down. I feel fresh and perked up but still need assistance in letting me get in and out of bed. My physio came and just ask me to do foot pedaling exercise, left arm exercise and breathing exercise. But no walking yet.  Then my surgeon came and he's telling me to walk around the ward. I said whattttt!! Then he said, movement will make my recovery fast and drains will be getting lesser and lesser. After my surgeon exits, I asked my physio and she said as for the moment, no walking yet. So conflict do happens  among the team. I rather listen to my physio and to my body which is weak. Day 3 post op: Again, nurse assisted bath. After my bath, my surgeon appears and asked me if i have tried walking around the ward. I just smiled and said carrying 4 drains is so heavy. How can I walk? Then he assessed each of my drain and said its not time to remove it but my nurse can assist you in the walking by carrying your drains. I said okay. Then the staff nurse asked me to get ready for a short walk. I was told to walk in a crouched position and to breathe in and breath out every step. Well, i managed to walk around the tv area. Its getting exciting. Evening time, my iv drip is giving me problems again and they had to poke another vein but not successful. It has to remain on the same vein Day 4 post op The next day that iv drip site is swollen. I complained to the nurse and asked to oralize my antibiotics. Well she was about to do that. Then came my chief surgeon who is happy about my tram flap and finally, told the nurse to give me oral medication instead and to remove one of my drains(rt breast). Yeah! My physiotherapist came and told me im now ready for my walking exercise. I did it with no problem except for pain in the knees. She said it can be solved by lifting leg exercise. As for the arm, I can't lift it up overhead. Only elbow height and I was asked not to lift it overhead or carry stuff since its still a delicate period of healing. Day 6 post op Two abdominal drains were removed and I was able to shower on my own. Walked around the ward many times. Then my breast cancer nurse came and showed me some exercises for my  right arm just nice till elbow height for the start. My surgeon mentioned that i should be discharged that day but seeing my rt breast drain. I am still not ready. Day 7 post op My rt breast drain was removed and I was ready for discharged that afternoon. I had to buy one compress girdle to support abdominal wound to be constantly worn for four weeks so the abdominal muscle will heal properly and not fail. During my entire stay in the hospital, they took note of the temperature between my skin spared breast and transferred muscle periodically.they are just checking if the muscle is alive and healthy. It was a painful journey for me but I am just amazed how the body regain strength after strenght and after strength each day. Prayers also helped . It gives you a comforting feeling of warmth & hope. Thats the end of my long report and thanks for all your well wishes.     ",
