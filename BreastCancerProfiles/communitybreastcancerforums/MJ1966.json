Just not a public person,but I've learned a lot from all of you.  I'm just really bummed today and,I admit,a little scared. My treatment has been complicated from the get go.  Had seroma develop after lumpectomy in January and ended up with a wound vac for 6 weeks or so,delaying start of chemotherapy until,April 4 First cycle about killed me...diarrhoea,nausea, vomiting,dehydration,etc. Had to have multiple iv hydations. MO reduced carboplatin dosage and said I'd be fine. Wrong! Over subsequent cycles I've required delays, multiple hydration, went. Into early kidney failure ,dosage changes and switched to cytoxan.Was scheduled for last chemo on 7/28 but today MO cancelled it and said I'd be fine without it and we can just move on to radiation.  Herceptin has been delayed for another four weeks too. Tho on one hand this sounds great it scares me....I've had so many changes and delays,what if those little suckers are still lurking out there and need just that last blast to convince them to leave me alone?  I'd hate to have gone through so much to no avail!  Am I crazy? And the start of radiation is scary,too! What complications is that going to bring?   Thanks for letting me vent. I have remained positive through all of this until today and every thing just hit me. My MO is great and I trust her, but....",

When is he doing blood work again?  I had three transfusions during chemo. Was nervous the first round,but made me feel so much better I was excited to get the others. Hang in there. There is no such thing as being a whiney baby. This process is brutal, but does get better!",

Nails are a mess.  Ends yellow/brown/black that I was covering with polish, but now they are splitting way back in the quick and tearing off. Not too painful like would normally be thank goodness. Apparently they have previously separated from the base and there appears to be a very thin layer of new nail covering . I also have prominent ridges (1 for each cycle of chemo I had) which makes polish less than smooth. Ahhh...the things I won't miss from this whole experience!",
