I will definitely go into next tx on 30th better hydrated to begin with and make sure ask if I can take the zofran more often. Just went and picked out my wig today. Will be able to pick it up next week, just in time for my hair to be shedding like crazy!",

I thought I would have a bit of a freak out while the Red Devil was going in, but my nurse was so awsome talking to me kind of distracting me. So now I am home and almost feel like a ticking time bomb waiting for some sort of side effects to start! I guess I could be lucky and not have anything more than some mild nausea...at least til my hair falls out in 14-18 days! we will see. I go back tomorrow for my Neulasta shot.

They gave me zofran and decodran to take for 3 days, but I am still super nauseaus and it is SO hard to drink my water or anything. I went in for my neulasta shot yesterday and they gave me some IV fluids which helped me get through last night, but today i can barely get off the couch to do anything. 3 more to go...I know I can make it but this first round was much harder than I thought. I am usually a pretty tough cookie. It is helpfull reading about everyone's tips on getting through it.",

I have posted a few times on other posts. Always feel like they have been so negative..sorry. Today is the first day I am feeling almost normal physically. It is 7 days out from first treatment. I only have 6 more days to feel ok before round 2. It was a tough 4 days or so for me after that first one. Staying hydrated seemed to be my issue! I think I already have a dose of \"chemo brain\" too! I lost my keys last Friday and still can't find them.....I have an appt tomorrow to get fitted for a wig. I have really enjoyed being on these boards the last few weeks and reading about all the other great strong ladies on here going through all this. We are not alone fortunately and unfortunately!",
