She had a biopsy on June 20th on a 2.1cm tumor. She has a team meeting on July 12th and I guess chemo starts a few days after that? She is just worried that her lymph node that was biopsied and is negative now could turn positive in the waiting period before chemo. What is the average time from diagnosis to the start of treatment? Also on that accord does doing a biopsy increase the chance of the tumor spreading? Thank you very much  ",

It was scary going in to the appointment but we were BSing with the nurse by the end. As of now she has no side effects. They infused some anti nausea and something else before the A bag then pushed the C in. Hopefully the side effects are weak.",
