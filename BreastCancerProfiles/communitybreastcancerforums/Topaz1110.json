I have not told her, since her memory and ability to cope are very diminished (she is 88). Seems lots of people who know people who know people are praying for me, and I swear I can feel myself buoyed up to almost giddy with it! I am headed to the airport to fly home now.and will be surrounded with love from my fiance, friends, and my 5 wonderful animals(2dogs, 3 cats) on New Years Eve. If I dont get online prior to the New Year, I want to wish everyone of us a joyous and meaningful 2008. You have already helped mine head in that direction. Xoxoxo Topaz(Maddy)",

Consulted with a neurosurgeon not related to the center where I get treatment.  He saw the MRI  and said \"50/50 odds that it is cancer\".  He was OK with my waiting 4-6 wks for biopsy, but also ready to do it now if I want.     I am consulting another neurosurgeon to see what he things. Have a feeling that I can consult a ton of docs, and no one will be able to tell me with any assurance that this is/isnt mets.    But biopsy might also not get cancer tissue:  Then was it missed, or was it not cancer?    I went back to work today.. It was weird.   I am still a nervous wreck and I guess will be for a while.

Your advice and empathy are a prayer answered. I will be back in the chats and communicating with you here as I find out what the plan is. A question; If you stopped working when Stage IV, did you miss it? I could go out on med leave and \"retire\"from a very high stress (but interesting) job, but dont know which is better option. If you kept working, did people get weird toward you? I am abt 20 yrs older than the 20 to 30 somethings I work with, and was already in such a different place in life from them before this ( they are a high pitched corporate climbing set for the most part). Hugs to you all, and special hellos to some old friends from my 1st go round here in 05. Gratefully your sister, Topaz",

I was scheduled for a biopsy after 12/20 MRI showed lesions in spine \"highly suspicious for metastatic disease\" in the area of my back where I have had pain for 3 mos.   The MRI also showed a mass in the spinal canal (also suspicious for mets).   Had bone scan: only lesions  that showed up were in thoracic spine where MRI lit up),   Today met with consultant rads onc. who reviewed the reports and my history,  and sent me for a brain MRI (to be sure no tumor in my brain)  and said I should see a spine surgeon for biopsy (not the neuroradiologist who was going to do it).    I liked her and planned to see the spine surgeon she recommended. Then this afternoon my onc called and said the neuroradiologist studied  the MRI, and they now think it is not mets but inflammation and spinal synovitis .   Told me to take NSAIDS (Motrin) for amonth and they will redo the MRI to see if it has changed. Holy Crud!! I am reeling(as is my family).. a month living with being told mets, waiting for definitive treatment.. and now I am in this new (more hopeful but terrifying to have hope now) limbo.   I need better communication from/with my onc... a month in limbo after told the MRI \"Didnt look good \" and a lot of \"Im sorry\"s about delivering bad news.. etc.. still no face to face meeting or treatment plan other than trying to schedule the biopsy , then rads.   A whole month later... \"we dont think its mets\"..     and now.. wait another month and then we will see??  Like being told \"Oh never mind.. just take two NSAIDS and call me in a month\" (I am NOT going to wait a month.. I plan to consult at least 2 spine specialists to review the MRI and advise me!!) I cant thank all of you enough for the support and information.     I have to regroup and try to understand what is going on now..   I am so scared they will change their minds yet again and tell me \"sorry it IS mets after all\" Blessings to all of you.. may you have good news... and fewer roller coasters and miscommunications on this  journey! I am and will always be your sister, mets or no mets. XOXOXOX Topaz (Maddy)",
