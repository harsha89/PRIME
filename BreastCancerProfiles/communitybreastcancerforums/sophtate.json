    "Content": "sophtate wrote: About two months ago while breastfeeding my son I found a smallish hard unmovable lump in my right breast.  I immediately saw a doctor who told me it was just a clogged duct and would go away in 2 weeks.  Two weeks later the lump hadn't gone away so I went back and they gave me a referral to get an ultrasound.  I had the ultrasound on both breasts and they found some cysts and one of the cysts was where I am feeling the smallish hard lump but the doctor said that he was seeing was not what I was describing (although they did say they saw some \"debris in the cysts).  It has now been a month since my ultrasound and during my routine breast exam I found another small lump on my left breast near the armpit.  I'm suppose to go back to get another ultrasound in 2 months because of the cysts on the other breast.  I'm wondering if a lump could grow so quickly that the ultrasound I had 1 month ago couldn't see anything but I could feel something 1 month later.  Log in to post a reply",
