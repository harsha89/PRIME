The pain doesn't ways remain there, sometimes it's there and sometimes it's not. Almost once a month, a sort of lump or pimple also pops up in my armpit but then that goes away too in a week. My family doctor did a few tests last year and he said it's nothing t worry about but since the past week, my breast pain has started coinciding with pain in my lower backbone. Please help, I'm scared. Log in to post a reply",
