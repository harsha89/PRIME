Both my drains came out the same day, six days post surgery. Hang in there, your other drain will come out soon.",

It radiates up the back of my arm, as well as from the pit of my arm across my incision. I'm doing my post mastectomy exercises. There is a pulling sensation from the pit of my arm to my wrist with the stretching exercise. My BS said I could do what I felt up to, with no lifting restriction on the surgical arm. The rubbing of clothes etc over my chest and arm pit feels like a burn being rubbed and rubbed, like slow torture. It has to be the nerves. When I put my arm at my side it feels like I have an orange sized lump preventing me from resting it normally, but there is no lump. Hope this explains more. The symptoms are really making me not want to under go any more surgeries for reconstruction.",

My main problem now is the horrible nerve pain. Burning, raw, constant pain. Any suggestions? I have to keep taking hydrocodone. Usually take first dose in the late afternoon and then before bed. I have been driving, cleaning, etc. trying to return to normal activity. Hard to stand the sensation of the surgical camisole with the insert in place, by afternoon it is unbearable. Your suggestions will be greatly appreciated.",

I lost it with my husband, but he was my rock, calmed me down, and sorted out the pebbles, that felt like boulders to me. Between the pain we are having, the diagnosis we've been given, the extreme changes in our lives that we are adapting to, the brave faces we are all painting on to show others that know us, the stress has to come out. The other thing that hangs over our heads is the next treatments- chemo and radiation. I start mine the 17th of September. I am not looking forward to it, but I know it has to be done. I'm in the process of looking at supplies for hair loss. Googling how to tie head scarves, how to draw on eyebrows, what is the best way to make drawn eyebrows stay on etc. Reading as much as I can about the drugs, side effects etc. these are the things I can control. We are all strong. But we still deserve to mourn our losses. I learned the weak moments make it possible to be stronger.",
