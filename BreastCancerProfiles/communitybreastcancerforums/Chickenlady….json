I joked that it looked just a bit like an apple cream cheese danish.  Two injections, the second was the worst... of course. My sister was with me.. thankful she was there to make me laugh.  Breast needed to be massaged after for a few minutes to help the dye move through the system. My boob did not turn blue, nor did I notice blue pee.",

(i think that's the spelling? ) test done?  Waiting for results to come tomorrow. Hoping for a low score ( which, is really hard for me to accept, since I\"ve been raised to always want a high score). Low score means no chemo. Getting my tats for radiation on Wed and meeting oncologist.  If I get a high score, then I'm off to chemo. Intermediate means we have a \"talk\" about what happens next. Armpit incision is still painful....although the surgical tape is almost all gone.. i think that's what has been causing the pulling?  but don't know.  Glad to hear of everyone's progress..",

I also have a sore throat from the breathing tube during surgery.  Makes it hard to talk.. but won't whine about that!!! A heart shaped pillow under my arm is a good thing to have!!! ",
