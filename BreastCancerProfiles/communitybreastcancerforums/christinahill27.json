Additionally, the cancer spreaded to my bones in several different locations. I had back spine surgery to remove the tumor. I am undergoing radiation right now in that area only. The head oncologist initially wanted to treat also with hormone blocker shots to prevent growth. But, another oncologist from that office is recommending chemotherapy (during radiation) instead. I have been through chemo before and know how it effects you. My question is is there alternaive treatments to chemo for a person with my diagnoses. Log in to post a reply",
