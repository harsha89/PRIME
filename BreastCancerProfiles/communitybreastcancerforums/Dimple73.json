I haven't seen too many people only getting one side done so good to know that that has been your experience. I figured if both sides are in the machine they may as well look at both but I do know there are a lot of false positives. I feel likeit would be good to compare sides though. I am fine getting a unilateral MRI at this point as I only have symptoms on the one breast. Just worry that if they find something, I will have to go back and get the other one done potentially.",
