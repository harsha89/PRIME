I was a good girl at 40 and took the baseline....also went a year later....but then it seemed more of a hassle to get the thing done.  Truth was I have dense breasts and hated the procedure.  It was uncomfortable and I didn't have anyone in my immediate family with BC, so thought it was a little crazy to have to get one every year. Had a hysterectomy at 43 and things were ok.  My gyno quit practicing, so I waited about another 16 months before finally scheduling with another one that was closer to my home town.  This doc was nice enough and when he saw that I had not had a mamm in almost 4 years he got on to me a bit.  I told him that i had no family history with BC and just wasn't convinced that I needed get one every year.  When I found out that I didn't have to have a physican referral to get one, I decided I was being stupid and scheduled another mamm about 2 weeks after my gyno check. The mamm tech was nice, gentle....but I knew something was up when she came back and told me that there was a \"wrinkle\" in the films.  She moved the machine all sorts of ways and took only 1 view on my left breast and started filming the heck out of the right one.  I tried to be calm and convinced myself that it was really just a \"wrinkle\" and they always have trouble getting my breasts out from under my arm pit and up on the plate. Sure enough my primary physician called me the next week to say that they had compared this film to the last ones and that there were major changes and some suspicious abnormalities in the right breast.  I needed ultrasound right away and a biopsy was already scheduled for the following week.  A nurse of his called me back with an appt for the ultrasound at a Breast Center (attached to the local regional hospital) and gave me my appt time for meeting with a surgeon for the biopsy and consultation. I guess I should have been more chatty with the ultrasound tech and just asked \"do these spots you are measuring line up with the microcalcifications on my mamm?\"  There was a grouping of 4 microcalcifications that I could see and then another one extending on out. All the rest of the white matter on the mamm was so foreign to me that I couldn't make any sense out of it.  No one said anything to me about what type of biopsy they are going to do on me based on the ultrasound results.  Everything on my report says medial right breast....but the ultrasound tech was pushing down pretty hard into my chest wall to get her pictures and she wasn't messing around much with the rest of my breast that was laying over under my arm.  Going to look up stereotactic just in case this is where it is headed. Thursday can't get here fast enough.   My 20th wedding anniversary is Wednesday.  What a way to remember this event!",

Got my last drain removed today.  YEAH!  I celebrated by getting a couple of mastectomy bras and 2 Amoena leisure weighted forms.  Can't officially wear them yet, but when I am more healed, I will at least look more normal. Yesterday, I put on a shirt, glanced in the mirror and had a flash back to when I was 10 years old.  I swear, my chest (physique) looked like I did at 10.  Weird, weird.  Guess that's why I decided to get myself something to fill in the concave and make me feel my age.  Wouldn't have been such an issue if my face looked like I was 10 instead of 47! Working on healing up until next appt with PS for discussion on what can be done re-constructively.  My tissue necrosis on the left has slowed.  I highly recommend that silvadene (sp?) prescription cream.  It's helping me grow some new skin over there. I read all the post-op posts and feel a kindred bond.  All going through same sorts of things to various degrees.  We need to listen to our bodies and take the time to heal. As you might have guessed by now, I am type A professional and had to make the decision today that I will need to take off another 30 days in this process due to the unusual nature of my surgery setbacks.   I'm the type who had a hysterectomy and went back to work in 2 weeks with a full load.  I'm usually going mach 5 whirlwind and I get results and get er done.  This situation has put me on my knees.  One minute I am fine, and the next minute I am crying and filled with profound sadness.  I have realized that the sadness comes from my loss of control over this aspect of my life.  I always said I knew that God was in control, but I guess he really has been in the back seat as I drove through life just asking occasionally which turn to take. Well, listening to Him and this body means that I can't do what I usually do and I have to say NO to alot of business situations and home life expectations.  I tell myself it's just for a season and that getting myself through all of this in 2011 will mean that I can get to a new version of normal by fall 2011...God willing. For the vast majority of the ladies on this forum, your surgery journey will go well and uneventful. It won't be without challenges, but remember that there are others here and in your personal life to help you get through the rough spots. On with plan B or C....I can take it.

Neither nipple was saved.  I was discharged from hospital next day following late afternoon surgery.  At first follow-up visit with breast surgeon 5 days later, they removed one of the three drains.  Drain on right side with TE was removed.  One drain on that side remained.  Continued tissue death on the left side was noted, but they sent me home to rest.  2 days later, I awoke with chills, fever and feeling that I was dying (not an exaggeration).  My husband called surgeon who said to go to ER.  PS on rounds had them hook me up to IV antibiotics and gave DX of breast cellulitis on the right side where TE was placed.  They admitted me to hospital again.  By the next day my regular PS visited and said it was not looking good and that the TE needed to come out along with some re-excision on the left side where tissue was continuing to die.  By then, I was feeling that I wanted to live without breasts as the infection continued to spread. I came through surgery #2 although I had tachycardia with very low blood pressures.  This had also been a complication of surgery #1.  I had never had this reaction to anesthesia before the BC diagnosis. Good news is that my pathology shows all cancer is out, I had atypical hyperplasia in the left nipple and areas of lobular cells that were atypical.  BS says I definitely would have had BC in left side as well.  Right side showed good margins with multi-focal grade 3 DCIS in 3-4 areas of the breast, so the area they biopsied was not all that was there. In hindsight, I wish there was a BC practice that specialized in women like me with dense breasts and almost NO fatty tissue in the breasts at all.  Had they known this by doing additional screening, I could have been prepared for the reality that I was not a candidate for TE and psychologically would have been better prepared to wake up to a radically different outcome. PS now wants to discuss doing a lattismus dorsal flap on both sides to try to give me some type of a breast form since I ended up with a radical BMX.  I'll listen to what he has to say and do my own research.  Cancer is out, but they still say I will need screening in future.  What they plan to screen....who knows.   I'm an aberration of a case.  Lumpectomy would have left me with months or years of undetected BC growing in right and left side, plus many more biopsies and other expensive tests.  I believe the BMX has saved my life.  I just need to figure out how my psych can develop a good self image with what is to come. I wish all who are going through this better cosmetic outcomes and most importantly a safe and successful journey to life without BC.",
