I consulted with a couple surgeons and a plastic surgeon and it didn't feel right. I met with another surgeon who referred me to an oncologist and they both felt it would be best for me to start chemo right away and then do double mastectomy pending reevaluation of my breast tissue via MRI after chemo (every 3 weeks for six rounds). I had my port implanted 7/5 and started chemo the next day. I've had 3 chemo's so far and its been really rough. I'm getting Herceptin, Perjeta, Carboplatin and Taxotere. I thought I would feel glad that I am technically half way through my chemo but I feel crappy. Each time I get chemo I feel like it burns away another layer of my soul. After my first chemo I was able to bounce back somewhat after about 10 days, but now I never really feel good or normal even leading up to my next chemo. I've been forcing myself to go for walks and stay active when I am physically able to - but I was such an active healthy person before all of this that it's just a lot to reconcile. I need to stay positive and I know many people have it way worse than me but it doesn't make it any easier. I find myself just wishing this time away. I am sure surgery will be another hard painful thing but I can't help but think chemo is the WORST. My doctor asked me if I wanted to lighten up on the chemo doses - has anyone ever done this? I can't really find a lot of other info or advice about it online. Anyway - I am happy to have found this forum! Sorry for the negative vibes today - just having a bad day. thanks!",
