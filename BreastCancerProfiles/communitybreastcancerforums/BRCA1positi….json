I am waiting for an U/S guided biopsy currently. The biopsy pain is nothing compared to the pain of waiting. I would suggest getting whichever method you can get done quickly. Pain fades, but waiting for a test is almost always worse than the actual test.",

For your situation I have a couple of positive things to say. Your lump is rounded, painful, and mobile. This is very good. Cancer cells need blood flow to grow, so the fact that it is movable means it most likely does not have a blood source. It is painful, that is typical for an abscess or a cyst more often than a tumor. Rounded shape is also a good sign. Costochondritis is literally inflammation in the cartilage between the ribs. This inflammation can be from an injury or infection. If you have a tumor, the cells are localized in the breast and would not present with symptoms to the chest wall this soon. Costochondritis takes a while to settle, try some ice packs for the pain, and I know it's hard, but do not rub it. Another thing you can do to ease your mind is research \"mastitis\" to see if your symptoms parallel. You can also express your nipple to see if the discharge is bloody or not. Do this only once for peace of mind, don't repeat many times. If the discharge is bloody then you have a problem, if it is not then breath easy. Hope this helps!",

I think its because of my age and all but I have to do the mammogram and ultrasound before they can even schedule me for an MRI! Just for your information the MRIs have a very high detail, therefore every single thing they find will be tested. I'm currently waiting for a biopsy for a mass found on the MRI. Even though the mammogram is uncomfortable it is much quicker than the MRI. For an MRI you have to lay on your stomach with your boobs hanging free, it's very uncomfortable to have all of your weight solely on your ribs, you have to stay in this position for about 30 minutes without moving, and no deep breaths. Mammograms are much quicker, plus if they find something positive on your MRI they will make you get follow up images via mammogram. Just letting you know you may not be saving any steps.",
