Everything in this moment is as it should be. Dx 11/10/2009, IDC, 5cm, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

My concern is that mx is a much bigger surgery, more recovery, etc. so I just want to make sure I am 100% on doing it.   Surgery is already scheduled for three weeks out, I'm at Sloan Kettering, so I'm very confident in the skill and knowledge of the doctors, but I need the reassurance from the \"real people\"  that are actually going thru this.  Great to have this forum to bounce these things off of others, it always helps to know you are all out there dealing with the same stuff.",

Is there any point in having them removed once you have been on Lupron for 2 years if you are in menopause anyway?  Do the ovaries still produce some estrogen after menopause, so removal is suggested?   I will get further details from my doc next time I see her, but any info you can provide would be appreciated.",
