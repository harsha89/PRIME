    "Content": "Aug 22, 2011 09:29PM - edited Aug 22, 2011 09:30PM by yorana I am awaiting a decision from SSA.  I have cancer of the chest wall, which I understand is stage IIIB, and is listed in the SS Blue Book under section 13.10-A.  First they told me they were considering my cancer a local recurrence and were waiting to see how it responded to therapy.  Then when I called back a few weeks later they said they were considering it a new cancer because of some inverted interpretation of section H of the first part of the neoplastic diseases section where it says that a person is considered no longer eligible for SSDI when they have been in remission for 3 years.   I have never been on SSDI.  I have a chest wall recurrence.  I had a mastectomy in 1999, and now I have cancer of the chest wall of the same breast.  It appears to me that I meet the listing for the condition due to having a chest wall cancer.  Tumor was removed surgically, but with narrow margins (0.3 mm & 0.5 mm) and there was some DCIS in there too.  Can't re-excise due to the chest wall.   I don't understand why they have to see how I do with the therapy.  It doesn't say that on the listing for chest wall cancer.  Also I am eligible for SSI due to income and haven't worked since April 2010.  I applied for SSDI and SSI in May 2011.  Got the positive biopsy done end of January 2011 and surgery late April 2011.  Any advice?
