That said, I had a similar experience to yours.  I felt a lump and went to my gyno.  At the imaging center where I went, the radiologist said it was fine.  But since I felt a lump, my gynecologist referred me to a breast specialist.  I had my films sent to a nationally recognized hospital and then went to their breast health center.  It turned out I did have early stage breast cancer.   So, I would suggest a second opinion, if only for your peace of mind.  It's probably benign--most are--but, in my opinion, it's always better to be sure! ",

As far as household stuff goes, there are tons of recipes online for safe stuff.  I was really hesitant about doing it, but it's so easy.  Most things are made with Dr. Bronner's castile soap, Arm and Hammer Washing Powder, Borax, and/or Vinegar.  Things that have been around for years.  I even made some deodorant with coconut oil, baking soda and cornstarch.  It works great.  I NEVER would've dreamed that I would do that and like it.  I guess after stinking my way through radiation I'm just happy not to smell!  (PM me if you want some resources for more info on recipes and stuff) I sent an email to Toms the other day because I bought some toothpast that says Natural on it but it has sodium lauryl sulfate in it.  That makes me really mad.  They informed me that it's made from plant products and therefore safe.  Since I don't believe them, I guess I'll either pay more for their one toothpaste that doesn't have SLS in it or find another kind. Hair products have been the hardest for me to find.  I'm using Alba Botanicals right now.  It does have a pretty strong fragrance and some stuff I can't pronounce in it, but I'm desperate. I tried the Dr. Bronner's and my hair was horrible.  I have dry, super curly hair and it's really picky.  I think I might try California Baby. I'm going to check out Neutrogena Naturals for a moisturizer.  I haven't been able to find one for day.  I use coconut oil for night, but it's kinda greasy for under makeup. Thanks for the recs, y'all!    ",

Fear is the worst.  It's debilitating.  I'm with Shirlann.  Take the valium.  Is there ever going to be a time in your life that you think might be more appropriate than this to take it?  ;o)  My doctor prescribed it and told me it was a muscle relaxer, which I guess in a sense, it is.  I was so knotted up from tension that I could barely turn my head.   ((((Big hugs))))  You will get through this.   ",
