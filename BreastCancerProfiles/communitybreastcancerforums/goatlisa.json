I am scared but encouraged by everything everyone has posted here.  Part of the reason I'm scared is because nothing about this experience has been \"linear\" and I've had several setbacks. I had a UMX on Oct. 26 with immediate reconstruction - there were 6 tumors in my right breast plus 3 areas of DCIS. However, no node involvement (confirmed by PET scan later) and no BRCA so I'm grateful for that. I have had lots of complications, though, including a staph infection, removal of the TEs on 12/21 and the rest of that week in the hospital.  I now have 2 open wounds that are refusing to heal and my PS, infectious disease specialist, and oncologist are all of different opinions about when it will be good to start chemo - I just want to get this show on the road.  I'm sorry to whine - I'm feeling pretty low about all of this tonight and feeling guilty about feeling low and whiny because I know I am fortunate to have a good PET scan and good genetic results. I shouldn't be fussing! I so appreciate everyone's posts about working, dealing with hair loss, SEs, etc. Y'all are amazing.  Lisa ",
