Had full 360 US of both breasts yesterday.  Right breast fine, nothing suspicious after the ultrasound. Radiologist thinks the MRI saw some hormone related changes in my breast as I am still going through menopause (at age 56!).   Left side, two small additional masses, one directly above the existing tumor and one directly below. She had a long talk with my surgeon while I was still on the US table and he can still do the lumpectomy given their size and location.  Didn't biopsy as everything will go for pathology anyway on Monday. Will now have the wires put in Monday morning when I get the radio isotope injection before the surgery.  I now wish I could have had the bilateral ultrasound at the very beginning. When I had my original US, they just did the lump that I had found. My mammogram 30 minutes before the US showed nothing.  But, I didn't know enough to suggest it and everyone I knew kept telling me that it would just be a cyst, don't worry, so had not even done any reading.  So, back on track after a day of derailment.  Going out tomorrow for a day of fun at a dog agility trial, probably last one for a while for me and my Buddy Boy.  Then surgery on Monday and then more waiting. Lots of hurry up and wait! ",

The new RO is super nice and is actually a little closer which will be better for the daily rads. However, she is not part of the hospital network, so I will have to make sure everyone gets copies of records.  Already I found out that even though she got the report of the PET scan I had before chemo, she didn't get the actual images.  Picking that up today and will bring it to her office. Looking forward to \"meeting\" everyone else starting this next phase of this journey that no one wants to be on!  And here's hoping for minimal SE for everyone! ",

Am always amazed at how different every doc and center seems to be in terms of what they do and what they tell their patients! For me, I am on a ramp from the waist up.  Head turned to the right (left side is being radiated).  No bars to hold onto, just clasp my fingers on the rest they have there.  Have a bolster under my knees.  I am getting radiation arc therapy ... the gantry passes over 6 times and I get a constant beam of radiation the whole time.  There are dozens and dozens of little \"fingers\" in there, leaves they call them, and they constantly move to custom shape the beam of radiation to my body to avoid heart and lungs as it passes over and this is all determined by the CT scan that I had on set up.  They also retake xrays once per week to compare to set up to ensure that everything is still in the same position.  I got 4 pinpoint tattoos at set up, and another after the first treatment, and two area where they used sharpie markers with clear, round stickers on top of those.  One of them came off each and every day and they had to redraw it every day.  After 5 treatments, they just put another pinpoint tattoo there.  That makes 6 little pinpoint tattoos of which I can't even see 2 of them without looking into a mirror :-) My RO showed me the scans ... found it quite interesting as it shows the heart and lungs all in 3D and then shows the radiation field.  My appointment is at 11am and I am back in my car ready to leave by 11:17 to 11:22 (digital clock in the car <g>), so it takes no time at all.  I meet with the RO on Mondays after treatment, so that day takes longer.  I go every day, Monday through Friday.  I will be finished on October 8 assuming they don't have a machine breakdown and my skin continues to hold up! So far, so good (keeping fingers crossed!!!)  Had some itchiness on my upper chest where the skin is the thinnest and has been exposed to the sun the most in the past.  They gave me hydrocortisone cream and that seemed to help a lot.   They also told me to moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!  3 to 4 times per day at a minimum.  And moisturize inside and out, so have to continue fluid intake which I find the hardest thing to do! Still don't have a cotton bra.  I had more time right after set up, but the seroma was leaking, so didn't want to try any bras on at that point in time. After that, had less time but I couldn't find one that fit in the store and haven't had a chance to go to the store at our hospital where they can custom fit me for one.  The whole radiation field feels warm for about an hour after rads (RO said that is normal) but it does seem a little sensitive sometimes as well, so I go braless when I can.  That is also when I slather on the Aquaphor and wear an old shirt that I don't care about :-)   Had seeping from a recurring seroma off and on since July, but continued with rads.  I have also seen a lymphedema therapist 3 times since starting rads and she was WONDERFUL getting the excess fluid from the seroma to just \"leave\"   Whole area finally feels better.  Am being very proactive when it comes to lymphedema!   Only started to feel fatigue at treatment #15 on Wednesday.  Different than chemo where doing any little thing meant I had to have a nap.  Now, it is more like I ran errands all day and need to rest with my feet up.  I do take a nap as it helps, but it really isn't the same as the chemo fatigue .. .thank goodness!! Was also told I might get a sore throat as the radiation field will clip the esophagus a bit.  I had lymph nodes involved so am being radiated from above the collar bone, under the arm pit down to below the breast and over to the center of my chest.  But, nothing noticable so far. Had a horrible time with chemo ... was in the hospital once, 2 blood tranfusions, reacted to the Taxol once, white counts down to next to nothing while on Adriamycin ... so am enjoying it that nothing major (so far) is going on with rads!   Also had another echo done 2 weeks ago (3rd one so far during all of this) and heart is showing no changes despite the Adria and after that the Herceptin.   MO had me do a bunch of blood tests ... that will determine where I am for menopause ... 57 years old and still had my period even while on chemo at the beginning!  Results will tells us whether I will go on Tamox. or an AI right away.  Won't start that until after rads are done.   Won't get a mammo until 6 months after rads are done according to the RO.  However, since mammos did not show my original tumor (I found it myself) we probably won't even do that.  Either US or MRI or both.  We'll see.  Just taking this one step at a time and getting through rads first.  THEN I will start eating better to lose some of this weight and also will increase my activity once the rad fatigue is gone.  Am signed up for a free Cancer Fit program through a local health club offered through my hospital but that doesn't start until January.   What a novel!!",

But mismanaged food on day one because I had to fast for the PET scan first thing in the morning. Then ate too much in prep for chemo later in the morning. Ate too much at dinner. Day 2 decided on frequent small meals.

Long story short, had to go to ER last night and then was admitted.  Still here and don't know when I will get home.  WBC have only risen slightly but the they are more concerned with the neutrophil (sp?) count - that is almost non existent and hasn't budged with the two blood draws they did.  Hubby was out of town and FRANTIC!!  He caught an early flight home - good thing as luck would have no one I could call on was home. So I left the dog and drove myself to the ER.  Dog was only alone for 12 hours and he was ok Temp has been down but until that neutraphil count is high enough I will stay here.  Waiting on a 24 hour blood culture - today should be ready in a few hours.  Also ran a urine culture. I have a seroma and the infectious disease doctor wanted that aspirated. 80ccs!!!  And there is about 50-60cc left in there still! No wonder it felt like an over inflated basketball - now that almost feels normal :-) haven't got results back from that either.  I was supposed to run an event this weekend - hubby brought my computer so I worked mist of the day and got everything printed to PDF files and emailed off to the people involved - they will run it for me. It was a great distraction today - not sure what I will do tomorrow :-( Unfortunately the MO came while I was getting the seroma aspirated which was done in another part of the hospital. Now have to wait until tomorrow - I have questions!!! Also have mouth sores so bad now that I am having trouble eating - can only manage soft foods. Even white rice was too hard!  Magic Mouthwash only goes so far.  Am bummed because I thought this was supposed to end up being a \"good\" week and here I am - the neutropenia patient in room 6 :-(   Getting two kinds of broad spectrum antibiotics and having someone come into the room every time I FINALLY feel I can nod off!! Overall I don't feel bad - better than Monday. But the bone marrow isn't  cooperating - WBC almost doubled but the darn neutraphils!! Come on Neulasta KICK IN!!",

And even seemed a little better from the time I woke up to the time of the aspiration in the afternoon.  However, it got a little more swollen after that and the redness is still there.  I figured that was normal as, after all, it did get punched with a needle :-). However, it isn't better now and feels a little worse again.  I had forgotten that a biopsy or aspiration hurts for the first 24 hours!  Haven't really had to deal with pain while on chemo ... Just feeling like crap half the time.  So this surprised me. I should have felt really good this weekend after the blood transfusion, but now have to deal with this.   Surgeon wanted me to call him on Sunday if there was still swelling and redness as he is on call all weekend.  Guess I will be calling him in the morning.  He will put me on a stronger antibiotic.   Really, really hope this doesn't delay my last chemo treatment on Tuesday!  Just want that part over.  I think this WILL mean I have to delay the radiation simulation I was supposed to have this coming Friday.   I am so disappointed about that.  Not only do I want to get this over with, but I also take part in a yearly event that happens in October.  This whole time, the thought of getting through all of the chemo and radiation in time to go has helped me get through this.  And the timing would have been tight anyway if all went well with rads ending 2 weeks before I was to fly to California.   Now .... Who knows.  There was even talk of cutting me open again to clean things out if antibiotics didn't work. Won't have the results back from the aspiration until Tuesday, so maybe am being premature.  But things never look good at 2am!

Only 2 more treatments ...  I just keep telling myself that so that I can get through this! :-)",

However, had a nice chat with one of the volunteers there who is a 7-1/2 year breast cancer survivor.  Always good to hear the success stories :-) As of this past weekend, appear to have developed cellulitis in my surgical breast. Was put on an antibiotic on Tuesday, but it doesn't seem any better.  Am seeing my breast surgeon in about 1/2 hour - was supposed to be a regular 3 month check up and was hoping he could see the \"new normal\" breast.  Nope :-(.  Was supposed to have the simulation for rads next week, but that will be out as long as this swelling is present.  Very disappointed and frustrated with this - so close to the next step, yet so far. Can't remember who it was, but someone was questioning whether to get a port?  GET IT, best thing ever :-).  As I was getting my transfusion today, it took two different nurses to access someone's vein for an IV - they were getting ready to call the IV team.  If you are going to have to have Herceptin for a year, it Is worth it.  I get all of my blood draws through my port as well.  It was uncomfortable at first, especially if I reached for something or tried to lie down on that side, but that didn't last that long.  A month tops?  Now I don't notice it at all, but am thankful for it every single week when they have to access it.",

The breast infection appears to be gone or most nearly so.  However, I started leaking clear fluid out of  my lumpectomy incision (last surgery was April 9!!) Sunday night. Saw the breast surgeon yesterday morning ... As long as it stays clear, then that is good. There is fluid in the tissue and it has to come out somewhere.  He thought I could have chemo but the MO had the final call.  He did, however extend my antibiotics just in case  My regulation MO wasn't there today but I rode up in the elevator with the PA so got to fill her in.  I was the first patient so I got right in and she examined me.  Then consulted with the other MO that was there. We decided to go for it rather than delay chemo for yet another week. So keeping fingers crossed no complications! I have been dose dense for all of my chemo and this was the first time I had 3 weeks between treatments. Really enjoyed having a clear head for almost a week and was a little sad to feel the fog descending as I sat in the chair - but only a little because it was the last time :-) I meet with the new RO next week.  I also arranged for copies of all of my records from all of the doctors to be sent to her so got that done as well.  Had to go and sign releases at the BS office (just down the hall from my infusion center) and our women's diagnostic center (other side of the hospital ... I was tired after chemo but I did it :-). The gal at the MO's office who takes care of that stuff got everything faxes while I was there so all of that is done. That one is super efficient :-) Have asked around and heard nothing but positive things about this new RO so I think it will be alright. Just a pain having to arrange for copies of results to be sent to her each time as she is not part of the hospital network.  Came home and slept the rest of the afternoon away. Now the steroids are kicking in so I can get some things done this evening and tomorrow before the steroid rash ;-) 5 hours PFC but who is counting ;-)",

Picked up my meds (Emla cream, Zofran, Compazine)  Also picked up Colace and Senna. And Claritin for the Neulasta shot on Wednesday. Got a prescription for a wig ... will go to the store at the cancer center tomorrow after the echocardiogram. And, of course, will have to call the insurance company.  Was supposed to get 30 tabs of Zofran, but they said the limit was for 9 tabs. Need to find out what is up with that!  Need to get a bag together with everything I want to bring to chemo.  Start upping my fluid intake. Start reading up on the specific chemo drugs I will be getting.  And remember to enjoy the visit with my sons this weekend :-)  One is driving home from Pittsburgh this evening, the other will come home after work tomorrow.  ",

Eat soft foods. Starting with mouth sores as well, so rinse frequently with either Biotine or baking soda/water rinses.   The Neulasta should get the WBC up enough to get treatment next week ... I sincerely hope so as I don't want anything delayed.  If there are cancer cells still floating around in my body, I want them nuked out of existence before they can spread their poison.   I picked up my wig today while I was at the hospital for bloodwork .. .so excited about it!!  I look like ME with it on!  Will get my head shaved next week as that is when I am due to lose my hair ... lady at the store will then trim the bangs after I am bald.  Yes, will be traumatic to lose my hair, but at least I will look like me when I am wearing it. The color and cut is spot on!   Everyone have a good rest of the day ... very dreary here in SE PA, but this too shall pass.",

I didn't think it would be this quick and thought it would hang in there.  But I still can't get it shaved until Wed.  Today is chemo day and I know I will be too tired afterwards. I wore one of my caps to bed just to contain the hair.  They won't care at the infusion center,I am sure they have seen it all :-)   Just wish I had the shave yesterday .... I am now surprisingly calm about this whole hair loss thing.  I knew hair loss was a guarantee and I know it has to happen.  And it has to better than this MESS of hair that is EVERYWHERE right now!  LOL. I have fine hair, but I have a LOT of it.   Mmtagirl right there with you!!  Chemo today, round 2!  I have decided to be very proactive this time.  I plan to follow a neutrapenic diet starting day 6 through to about day 10.  Conserve my energy as well.  I am getting a reduced dose today so hoping that helps as well.  mmtagirlalso right there with you with getting a period!! Have cramps this morning and am bleeding very slightly, but it is there :-(. I really thought chemo was supposed to stop this - was HOPING that would be the case.  Heck,I have to go through this whole cancer, surgery, chemo, radiation thing, but getting my period as well?  Not fair :-) Chknfeet  hope you get out of there quickly as the hospital is no place to rest!  I was there last week from Tuesday night to Friday afternoon.  2 different doctors told me that they only ever figure out the cause of infection in about 25% of cases like yours and mine.  jhodro  interesting re drippy nose and Claritin ... didn't think of that. I think I have lost nose hair as my nose is a little drippy, but not much.  However, I am still on Claritin.   Wishing everyone a great day ... Going to have some breakfast, intake a lot of fluid and then off to chemo round 2 where I expect to be BORED! :-) ",

Any opinions as to whether that will be too late?  Don't want to look like my head is molting :-)  Veggies  as I was neutropenic this week, I had been cautioned against eating anything raw or fresh, or anything with a peel that couldn't be cooked.  Could not even have fresh flowers around.  Just be aware of this when going through nadir.  I can eat what I want now that my counts are up again.  Even though I can't really say that my taste buds changed drastically, I certainly have had an aversion to foods, and that seems to change every few days :-)",

I was told to take one the day before the Neulasta shot (ie day of chemo), day of Neulasta and then every day for 3-5 days.  I was kept on it while in the hospital - maybe because they expected my counts to come exploding back.  I don't remember what they told me :-) Quite frankly, give the nasty chemo drugs that I am being given, the thought of taking an OTC drug like Claritan once a day doesn't bother me in the least. I have friends that live on it every spring and fall due to allergies.  And I was never one to take any meds lightly in the past!",

Now?  I would also have a lot of walking but the organizers have access to golf carts so it would have been doable. I was even going to ask someone that I know who moved out there to bring me one of this anti gravity chairs so that I could take a nap if I needed it as we always have really long days. There is a ton of work that happens before the event and that has already started. I have a feeling I will get to do all of the work but not get to go out there and be part of it!  I guess it is good that this happened this year. Last year the event was closer to home so that my husband could come along and we drove  the RV there.  For the first time ever, I was able to run my own dog at the event - all of the other times I had to fly and went on my own (I won't fly this dog and wouldn't run a dog if I didn't have help - I have too much to do anyway to add looking after the dog on top of it!) The organization doesn't even know I have breast cancer - now I am wondering if I shouldn't have let them know just in case I couldn't go so that they could have found someone else.  But, never in my wildest dreams did I think of this set back!   I have been secretary for 3 trials since breast cancer and missed two of them - and sat (slept actually!) in the RV for most of the one that I DID get to. Did all of the pre and post trial work and had someone stand in for me for the actual events. Have another trial in 2 weeks and now am wondering if I will get to go to that one!  At the very least, if my last treatment is delayed a week, that means I will be going through the worst of the SE during that weekend - great :-( I have been able to be pretty positive for most of the \"wonderful\" journey. This event was my short term goal and made it all worthwhile. That this now might not be a possibility has me feeling down right now.  One bright side - the antibiotics have taken care of my Big C problems ;-)",

So, either the Vit B's helped, or that is an SE that doesn't last long for me.  Will find out next week I guess!  Hoping it is the Vit B's as couldn't sleep for 2 nights  Hoping I don't get itching or hives .... I am allergic to Benedryl! (Break out into hives ironically)  Tomorrow is my bloodwork day plus will also be the weekly Herceptin. Taxol is not supposed to be as hard on the blood counts, but I can feel that they have dropped somewhat ... Will be interesting to see if they go as low as they always did on the A/C For those going through bad SE, here is hoping they lessen or go away altogether.   I try to stay positive but it is hard sometimes.  But, then I realize I only have 3 treatments left so got more than halfway through this somehow!   ",

Whereas chemo was NOT fun at all, at least nothing hurt for the most part.  Yeah, had bone pain, but it only lasted for 2 days after Taxol treatments.  I had pain after surgery and had discomfort during the two infections and then again during the bouts of seeping of liquid.  Time to go and moisturize the radiation field again ... they want me to moisturize 4 times a day and so far, so good! ",

Need to find out what it is ... Starts with a Z or X Herceptin finished the day.  I had driven myself to the the treatment, but called hubby to pick me up as still felt foggy in my head. Will get my car when he drives me back for the Neulasta shot tomorrow.   Blood work was mostly good.  Hemoglobin starting its descent again, but still 9.5.  Platelets are now the concern.  Got the treatment today even though they were quite low, but if they keep dropping might have to postpone next treatment.  ARGGHH, just want this DONE!  Supposed to be finished on July 29!   Came home and went straight to bed and slept so soundly.  Didn't have a clue what time of day it was or even WHICH day it was when hubby woke me up for dinner!  Still feel that way a bit - had been enjoying a much clearer head on the Taxol up until today ....

I had my second last treatment yesterday with NO reaction to the Taxol this time.  Last chemo will be on July 29 but will then continue with Herceptin every 3 weeks until June of next year.  Will be done the chemo portion, but won't be \"done\" Haven't even spoken to the onc about any of the anti estrogen stuff yet.   Had my consult with the radiation oncologist this morning.  Will be doing the simulation on Aug 1, then starting radiation the week of Aug 18.  Probably for 5 weeks ... he wasn't definite yet as he has to see the simulation.  He is very nice though, I like him a lot.  Was hoping to start 2 weeks after the last chemo, but he likes to wait 3 or 4 weeks as the skin can still be very sensitive to burning before then.  Makes sense. Funny thing out of that consult ... because I am through menopause, I have to have a pregnancy test done.  I laughed at that one as nothing has been going on in that department while I have been having chemo.  But that is the standard of care, so I will go and pee in a cup.  Too funny though :-) Also had another PT session with the lymphedema therapist.  She got rid of the little bit of cording that I had a few weeks ago, but I still don't have 100% range of motion back and am still a little tight.  Getting there ... going back the week after my last chemo and then again after radiation starts.  Depending on how I am doing, I might keep going back during and after radiation until I am 100%.  Radiation can increase the risk of developing lymphedema, so doing all of this proactively.   Then went and had the Neulasta shot.   Everything is being done at my hospital center, so it is all convenient. Even though I had a bad night last night due to the ton of steroids I had yesterday and the hot flushes that I am developing, I still feel very energetic today.  That will all change tomorrow when the steroids wear off :-)",

That also means radiation is delayed.  And got bad news from the RO's office.  Apparently, although the actual DOCTOR is in network with my insurance, the facility is NOT, so I would have to pay thousands of dollars of out of pocket fees (I confirmed this with my insurance company)  I am so disappointed as this RO came highly recommended by so many people .... at least 3 of whom had personally had him as their RO!  I already had my initial consult with him and really liked him and the facility.  Plus, his facility is connected to the hospital facility that is just 10-15 minutes up the road and he has access to all of the hospital records ... including all lab reports, pathology reports.  He is on the first floor of the same building where my BS and MO are ... and now I can't go to him :-(    My hospital doesn't have their own radiation equipment, so I now have to go to someone totally outside of the hospital system ... which means getting copies of EVERYTHING. Of course, I find out all of this late Friday afternoon, so can't even get an appointment with the next closest RO.  Will probably wait until my appointment on Monday with the BS to see if he has any recommendations.  The thought of driving even further every single day for 5 or 6 weeks is something I am not looking forward to. The next major hospital would require driving through a lot of traffic every day.  And there is one facility that I will NOT go to as I have not heard good things about it so that cuts out another few off of the list.  Would have called my nurse navigator, but she has left for the weekend already. Just so disappointing ... hate 11th hour stuff. And although I am thankful we do have insurance, insurance drives me NUTS.  Have to deal with dental insurance at work all the time (work for a dentist) and that gets VERY frustrating!   So close and, now, yet so far :-(",

Haven't been on here for 2 weeks ...life got busy!  I need to read through the last few pages of posts, but don't have a lot of time right now. Am 3 weeks PFC and head is really clearing.  No more muscle or joint pain.  I only had slight neuropathy in my finger tips and that is gone. My head keeps thinking I can do a lot now ... But my body says no :-). Energy is coming back very slowly.  Have peach fuzz on my head!! Hard to see but it is there!   Started radiation yesterday ... Will have 23 whole breast then 7 boosts, for 30 in total.  2 done, 28 more to go :-).  Surgical breast started leaking last week again .. Due to the cellulitis I was told.  Was afraid that it would delay radiation, but it stopped and there was no infection that goodness.  Looking forward to reading what everyone has been up to the last two weeks ... Probably will catch up in the next few days! ",

Bottom lashes are gone, most of upper lashes gone.  Most of eyebrows but still have enough to get by.  If they don't grown back as full I will be happy :-) I had no trouble with the hair loss.  I am patiently waiting for the peach fizz to turn to hair, but not impatient about it.  However, the eyelashes are a different story!  I didn't look like a chemo patient before while wearing my wig, but now with my naked eyes I am impatiently waiting for those :-) Taste buds are totally back ... Had a tuna sandwich the first day of chemo and haven't had one since.  Have now had two in the past week and it tasted normal again :-)",
