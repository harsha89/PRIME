I am concerned that after one round of Xeloda, you are experiencing some hand/foot syndrome. The onc will probably change your dosage a few times while you are on Xeloda. The redness, soreness etc. is graded. Grade III/IV is the worst. It feels like you are walking on broken glass. When you get to that point or your skin cracks so bad it bleeds, you are usually taken off Xeloda. So TRY to stay on it as long as possible. Lather up!!!! Xeloda is notorious for bringing down tumor markers and reducing the size of tumors! Good luck!!",

We will be there for you and hold your hand! it seems to me that there are a few misconceptions going on here...pregnant yes or no? cancer yes or no? what else can they throw at you???? seems a good thorough check up is in order then a referral to a specialist would be next. If it is questionable, then further tests are in order. You are not diagnosed with cancer on the first visit w/o tests. Think of the scan as a positive test. Once the scans are read, you will know what you will be dealing with. It's the unknown that can really throw you in a loop. Keep your chin up and let us know how things are going. Lori",

So, I have been in college since before my Stage 4 dx. working toward my teaching degree in special education/ elementary education. August, I will be student teaching and hopefully, January in my own classroom. At this point, half of me wants to just finish the darn thing but part of me (when I feel good) says, yes! I want to be a teacher  even if it's just for half the school year. So I push myself and then I fall into a ditch and say \"what the heck?\" It's an emotional rollercoaster! Iknow it is what it is and I can't change it. But I do still get mad! ",
