We'll see what the next bone scan reveals. Lynne, maybe you should have a meeting with your onc to discuus the pros and cons of some of the other chemo drugs he has in mind. If you're still unsure about your decision, I would leave it up to him.  Good luck to you...caring thoughts and prayers coming your way. Rose",

I'm going to be starting on radiation treatments to control the pain . How effective were your radiation treatments for your shoulder in Nov.?  I'm on Arimidex too. I remember when I first started it, it seemed to make my bone pain worse, especially my back. After a month it seemed to get better. But now I've been having this other pain that the radiation is for.  I hope your pain gets better and you'll feel better after you talk to your onc. Hope all turns out ok. Rose",

So beautiful, peaceful, and really getting into nature. One morning as I was looking out the window for the school bus for my sons, I couldn't believe it, but there had to be 30 very BIG cows blocking my driveway! What to do?? My husband heard somewhere that if you distract them with food, they'll just follow you till you place it down. He asked me what kind of food he should bring them. How the heck should I know, I don't have any cow food I responded. There was some left over spaghetti from last nights dinner: maybe I'll bring that hubby says. I looked at him and said I didn't think cows ate spaghetti! By this time, I noticed that now the school bus was coming up the road. So he grabbed the first thing he saw to lure the cows away from the driveway and make a path for the bus. What he grabbed was a loaf of italian bread! (remember we lived in NYC) He goes running up the driveway wildley waving this italian bread around. Well they moved alright....they all circled around him and he couldn't get out! Thank God the bus came and I started waving frantically for him to wait because my boys weren't up there yet. When I looked at the busdriver, he was laughing his head off watching this scene with my husband and the cows. He honked his horn a couple of times, and miraculously, the cows walked nonchalantly into the woods. I'm sure that story spread all over town. Just a funny memory...we still laugh about it today!

I was so impressed on the level of professionalism and caring attitude. I started with chemo. I received that \"red devil\" chemo that kind of did me in. I wasn't nauseous or anything like that, but so tired...all I wanted to do was to lay down. The chem was followed by a bi-lateral mastectomy. I was diagnosed with cancer to my right breast, but I opted for removal of the left one too. Truthfully, my surgery wasn't as bad as I had anticipated. Those dam drains though were the most problematic! Six weeks after surgery I was scheduled to do my rounds of radiation. Other than having to be there everyday for my treatments, I really didn't have major complaints. So now, I'm taking Arimidex every day along with the Xgedva shot I get every 4 weeks. I was on the Zometa trial and thought I was doing pretty good until the scans came back and showed increased activity. So, now my onc wants me on the Xgeva, believes it's more superior to Zometa in prevention of bone complications. I have some moderate bone pain but with pain med. management it seems to be in control for now. Other days, well, I'm like a basket case. I get depressed and so anxious thinking about all of this that my brain is on overload! I don't know if you're spiritual or not, but I returned back to my faith after I got sick. It's been a great comfort to me and helps me to put things in perspective. Also, my wonderful, wonderful family have been with me every step of the way! I don't think I could have done this without them. You know...mu husband even took care of my drains and the yucky stuff that comes with the. I never thought in a million years that he would have the stomache to do this. So, I really try not to project a hundred steps ahead of me, just focusing on whats happening now. I think I wrote more than you wanted to know so I'll end here. One last thing,  be good to yourself!! Sending you hugs. Rose ",

During my course of chemo and other treatments, I could hardly walk so I opted to use a cane. My ONC said we'll try some radiation to the hip as that was the area it was stemming from and also one of the areas that I had mets to. Well, 2 days after the radiation, the severe pain in my hip vanished. Right now I'm taking Tramadol and Naproxyn for general pain and seems to be pretty effective.I also take Arimidex every day and just recently started on Xgeva, (was taken off Zometa) I hope it all turns out well for you so that you are comfortable and not in any severe pain. This cancer really sucks big time! I'm so glad I found this website, it's been so helpful and supportive!  (((HUGS)))!",

In my case, that has helped me so much. I'm 2 years in getting my stage IV diagnosis. I have bone mets all over the place. But I think I'm somewhat used to it now. My greatest fear now is that it just stays in the bones and doesn;t decide to go sight-seeing through the rest of my body. Are you a spiritual person? I turned back to God after my diagnosis. I now read the bible too. If someone told me this before I got sick I wouldn't believe it. But now, for me, that has helped me to grow stronger both physically and spiritually. I still have my own private pity parties, but not as many. I still cry and think of the day I will have to leave my family. But all in all, right now, I'm really trying to live my life. We're going to Las Vegas for my birthday in May! You have to reward yourself now and then and do something out of the ordinary. And I continue to pray, every day. It really does help in strenthening my heart and my spirit. I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers. Here is one of my favorite quotes. I find it really encouraging and maybe it will be for you too: 'Ring the bells that can still ring Forget your perfect offering There is a crack in everything Thats how the light gets in.\" (((HUGS)))!",

I, too, was worried that I'd spend the whole time in my own pity party! But that wasn't the case. We haven't seen each other for several years, so we spent out time  on happy times that we all shared growing up and getting back to the core of the family! I really miss them, but so thankful that I was able to spend such quality time with them.

He may consider to place you on a diuretic such as lasix. In the meantime, keep your legs elevated and you may want to try TED stockings or A-E hose (anti-embolus). They're a real  pain in the ass to get on, but they seem to be really effective for swelling and prevention of blood clots. I hope your swelling gets better and be more comfortable. Rose ",

This dam cancer just causes so much havoc...there are times I actually feel like I have dementia. I was out the other day having a pleasant time with my husband and we spotted a beautiful deer. I was mesmerized by it's beauty and freedom. Well, seconds later, I began to cry. The reason being is that I used to live upstate NY and we had a beautiful view of our woods and the deer that used to come right up to our back deck. This was also the time I refer to as my other life, the one when I was normal, the one that didn't have cancer in it. Thats why I was crying. Sorry, got off to a bit of a rant. But wanted to let you know that during my \"journey??\" I've seen that my perspectives and priorities have changed so much. I don't worry about silly things anymore, I focus all my energy on those that I love and thats my husband and my 2 grown sons. So Katie, put everything else aside and put all your attention on things that mean the most to you, like your precious daughter. Things have a way of getting back into some dimension of balance. Take care Katie. Have a wonderful time enjoying your daughter's birthday and being around those you love. Sending my thoughts and caring wishes your way!  Sorry again I started to get off on my rant.
