    "Content": "Feb 10, 2019 07:55PM - edited Feb 10, 2019 07:58PM by Daisygirl66 I scheduled my radiation treatments at 720 am so I could get to work as early as possible. I had a sudden impulse to take a nap on most days 3 to 4 hours after my treatment. I am lucky enough to work from home on most days so I was abe to nap at lunch time. I would also suggest speaking with your Superior at work to explain the possibility of sudden onset fatigue which requires a quick nap. That usually did it for me. My rad techs suggested 100% pure, clear aloe for the affected breast immediately after treatment and at night. I had very minimal skin browning. Best wishes to all.",
