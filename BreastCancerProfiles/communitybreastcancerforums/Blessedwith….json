My dear friend was dx about a month ago now with bc triple negative, and last week's CT scan showed it has now gone into her lungs, stage IV. She is my daughter's boyfriend's mother. She is a wonderful woman, 53, and her own mother had bc and died of it in her late 50's. I've been reading many threads on this wonderful site and learning a lot, helping and talking to her about her options, etc. Originally she was trying the homeopathic route and it was making me nervous but now that she's at this stage, she's doing chemo starting the process this week. She has nine grown children...14 grandchildren...and she's quite healthy otherwise. I don't know what type of chemo she'll be undergoing but I've learned this type of bc is difficult to treat. They told her chemo might work yet it might not. They're saying to her that if the tumors do shrink, they will do a lumpectomy then radiation. I'm not sure what my question is...I guess i'm afraid for her and I want to do everything and anything I can to help her. I've offered to cook, clean, run errands, etc but she hasn't taken me up on my offers yet anyway. We are like kindred spirits...the more we learned about each other, the more we had in common. We text daily, and we know we are there for each other 24/7. I appreciate so much all the conversations here and am taking notes on what to expect, but if there's any advice on what I as a friend can do for her, I'd really appreciate it. Since she still does have 3 children and an elderly father living with them at home, she has her hands full. I know she worries more about them than about herself. I am in admiration of all of you dear ladies and wish you nothing but the best in your journey to wellness...",

I've taken notes and I also went on the chemo thread and wrote down items for a chemo bag that I'll put together for her. Sometimes I don't know if I bring it up too often or ask too many questions. I've asked her that before and she says no,it doesn't bother her, but now that she's getting the treatments started, I want to be cautious. Julie, you give me much hope! When I heard she had stage 4 I was so worried. I read so many things that just scared me. But here, it seemed brighter and that there was more hope and you've shed a lot of light so thank you. And Vegas!! Wow, you'll have fun. I've never been and I'm only about three hours away but it's a happening town so enjoy. Lol! I guess if your wig does fly off you'll give new meaning to \"what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas!\" 😋 Thanks again for all your input...and bless you ",

Was just reconfirmed at Stage 4 with 5 tumors in her lungs. She's getting set up with a port next week. She's still very ambivalent about chemo and radiation since she's quite a holistic type person and doesn't do well with meds. I share with her many thoughts and recommendations that I learn here. She was told that even with chemo, she's looking at 2 to 3 years to live. I told her not to listen to that, that doctors have to tell her a timeframe but don't listen to it. I don't any details about her treatment. She will Have chemo first, then surgery. I will be putting a chemo bag together for her as recommended on another thread. Thanks for letting me share here...bless you all..",

I asked about that yesterday and she was in a cloud...she was just getting ready to have her appointment and she says that lately, all her appointments are just a blur. Her husband takes notes and asks questions then they talk later at home. I know she's looking very tired and feeling the strain. The dr called her Thursday and wanted her port done Friday (yesterday) so the chemo could start on Monday. She and her husband are really feeling rushed and not totally secure with it. My thought is that the cancer is moving fast and need to start treatment ASAP. But I didn't tell her that. She still wants a second opinion. I thought she had gotten one but she hadn't. Initially she had said surgery on the tumors in her breast. But now I'm not sure. And I don't know the size of the tumors in her lungs. I will try to find out. Yesterday before she had her port put in, we got our nails done. She said I don't care but I'm going to get my nails done! So we went. It was a good way to get her out of the house but we talked chemo and cancer the whole time. :( I will go to the mets to lungs forum. Thanks for the tip. ",
