Just like Noon, I went through what she did. Last year, at my 3 month doctor's visit,(it had been 2 years, and I was about to go to 6 month visit.) one of the doctors asked me, if I was having bone or back pain. \"No, should I be?\" (When I am in a panic, I make jokes.) I was told my tumor marker was up, and then they went looking. The cancer went to my backbone.( I felt like the rug was pulled out from under me. I was a basket case. My blood pressure shoots up everytime I go to the doctor now. It's fine at home.) I was told it was on the bone, not in the bone. Anyway, I had a hysterectomy, and have been on Femara and Zometa. I don't know what has upset me the most. My grandmother died when BC went to her bones, but that was 44 years ago. I have heard doctors say, that we can live 20-30 years with it. Which is OK with me, because I just want to raise my son to adulthood. The only time I really feel crappy, is right after the treatment. Emotionally, it's a fight everyday.",

When I was first rediagnosed, my rads doctor said that they recommend rads, if I were in pain, but since I have no pain.... I said I thought rads killed the cells, that is why we have it during BC. Anyway, they said yes, but in my case, it would do more harm than good. It could hurt vital organs. What I wanted to ask is, did it kill the cells? Also, are you having problems from the rads?",
