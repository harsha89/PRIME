Just one thing to really say is to make sure if possible, to bring someone with you to your appts, my ex husband comes with me and it s sure great to have a second pair of ears. What you don't hear, that second person will. I think I am going to start chemo in the next couple of wks also.  Keep in touch ok    Carol",

I must admit though I am alittle scared of the chemo treatments that go with all this, are you starting yours now? If you are, fill me in ok.I hope you are feeling better too without much pain.

I was diagnosed with IDC Stage 1 Grade 3 ER-PR neg.Her2+. Had partial mastectomy on July 16th and had my port put in on Aug 3rd and had my first chemo treatment on Aug. 4th. So far no side effects except for being tired, and not being able to sleep at night. I am keeping a log on my side effects as they occur.",

I thought my world was coming to a huge crash, but as the days came and went, I realized I was not alone, these posts have been a god sent for me, don't get me wrong, my family is behind me in all of my decisions, but reading these posts made me realize, life is not crashing in on me. I had a partial mastectomy week and a half ago, and I am mostly pain free, I guess it helps knowing that the horrible cancer invading my body is gone!! Take ONE DAY at a time with your planning,take someone with you at your BS,or others appts. it helps having a second set of ears to understand what is planned for your treatments. Like today, my visiting nurse is coming and maybe I can get my drain removed, and that is it for today. Let your children know whats going on, you will be surprised how they will help. keep in touch ok",

I am so glad that my cancer was taken care of early enough, that my family can celebrate this holiday season. My prayers are with Kimerly and her loving family, I wish her all the comfort she needs.
