      "Content": "Sep 5, 2011 04:48AM - edited Sep 5, 2011 04:49AM by DebConway I was diagonosed with Stage 1, Grade 1 breast cancer and had a partial masectomy on August 4. I have just completed my 5-day treatment with the SAVI device (Sep. 2). I live in Indianapolis, Indiana; and received my treatment at IU Cancer Center. I was IU's first patient to receive treatment with the SAVI device and the company was there with the radiology staff every step of the way. The company flew in the SAVI rep to train the radiology staff; and on my first day of planning there were tweleve people in the CT scan room with me. The company seems to really care about the quality of care patients receive with their device. The local rep was very sweet and was there for many of my treatments. I experienced no pain when my breast surgeon placed the device, no pain during any of the treatments and no pain when my radiologist removed the device on Friday after my final treatment. If you live in Indianapolis I would highly recommend IU for your surgery and treatment afterwards. They really do care about their patients!",

I had a lumpectomy on August 4 and began internal radiation with the SAVI device on August 29. I did not feel the traditional radiation was right for me. My cancer is on my left breast and I was concerned about damage to my heart and lungs. I am glad I choose this method and experienced no side effects or pain from the treatment. Five days, 2x a day and I was done. Just could not afford to take six weeks out of my life for the other treatment. Good and luck to you!!",

I live in Indianapolis and had 1.5cm mass removed and then did the SAVI radiation treatment at the IU Cancer Center. They also have a team approach and they all met to discuss my treatment after my surgery. Mine was on my left side and I made the decision to go with the SAVI rather than risk damage to my heart and possible rib fracture, etc. My thoughts and prayers are with you for a complete recovery.",

I'm not sure it's the same as what you are having done; but the doctor numbed the site first and I didn't feel a thing. It turned out to be cancer (grade 1, stage 1) and I'm already done with surgery and radiation. From late May to September 2 was the length of my journey and I can say I was blessed to meet many great doctors along the way. I hope and pray you have a negative cancer result; but if you do my prayers are with you. I did elect to have the SAVI device for radiation and it was the best decision for me. Five days of radiation 2x a day and I was done.",

I was the first patient at IU in Indianapolis to receive treatment with the SAVI and two reps from the company came and oversaw my treatment. No pain from putting the device in, no pain from the treatment and no pain upon removal. One of the disadvantges of the MAMMO site is they can't custom design your treament. It radiates the whole tumor space. My SAVI had nine individual cathethers and each one was custom programmed to my tumor. If it is close to the skin I believe they can even not send radiation to that catheter.",

It is more stable once placed in the breast than the mammosite and can be customized by the individual cathethers for each woman. If it's close to the skin I believe they can choose to not deliver to that cathether. No rash, no burns, no heart or lung damage and all done in 1 week. Can't beat that! Take care and God bless!",

I have a feeling your mom is a strong lady if she is anything like you. You live in the US right? Your mom can research and find the best treatment center and medical oncologist, surgeon and radiation team. I was just shy of grade 2 and mine was smaller than your mother's. I chose to not have standard radiation; but internal radiation with a device called the SAVI. (google it) Painless and over in 5 days. The choices we have now are life saving. If you can be there for her it will make a big difference. My son cooked meals for me and wouldn't let me lift a thing. My only advice is to really research the surgeon, medical oncologist and radiation oncologist and go for the best.",
