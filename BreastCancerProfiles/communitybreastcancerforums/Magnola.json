I was in the doc's office today and read an article that Sept. 8 is National Real Hair Day...never knew there was such a thing, but I think that's my cue to loss the hat forever.  3 weeks more growth should be just enough.  I'm circling 9/8 on my calendar! Susan, your hair is awesome.  That's the style I would like to get to and then keep it there! -Maggie ",
