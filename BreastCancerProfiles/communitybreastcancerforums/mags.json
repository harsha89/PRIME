It's a fairly new procedure I think and is only 80 % successful.  They take fat from somewhere else and inject it into your breast. Sometimes the body just re-absorbs the fat though. You could always have an implant if you're not happy with the way your breasts look. It's been 3 1/2 years since I did my lump and rads and I'm not really in any hurry to do anything. My breast is significantly smaller than the other one but with a bra and a chicken fillet lol it doesn't look too bad. I hope you find a solution that makes you feel happier about your body. Hugs Mags ",
