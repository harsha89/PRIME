Anyway during the exam..the tech said I see an area under the left armpit..I need to take pics at a different angle! That was Monday..Friday my doc's secretary called and said he wanted to see me in his office regarding my tests! (she told me it was bloodwork but I knew)She then said how about tuesday? I said..sure I will just have a relaxing weekend worrying?? thanks...This was her scond week on the job! I said tell him to call me!~ Today he apologised..he did try to call me on friday several times...I have a teen daughter who needs the phone removed from her ear!  Apparently I have a lump 1.5centimeters...He is sending me for a breast ultrasound! I go friday! he is also sending a letter to the lab regarding the tech ..who has no bedside manner! Oh and his secretary said very sorry!! I just smiled and said..good luck!  My concern.......Why a breast ultrasound??? I thought after a mamogram and they found a lump...It would go straight to a biopsy!!! So my ultrasound is friday.....Has anyone else gone this route???? thanks maggie.......thoughts and prayers for all.. Log in to post a reply",
