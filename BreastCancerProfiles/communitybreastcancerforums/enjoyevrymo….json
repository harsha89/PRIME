My friend had gone there and told me it was a great experience for her, she sees an oncologist there and is very happy. I chose to see an oncologist in my area who I have every belief in. Edited: I realized that for all I know the other hospital can be great for you too, and if it is more convenient and excellent then that may be best for you. Can you talk to people who have been treated there to get their perspective. Best wishes!",
