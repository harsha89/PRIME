I never thought that after I was diagnosed , went thru surgeries, chemo and radiation that I would ,3 years later still be consumed by this side effect. October brings BC into the national spotlight. I'd like to somehow let the powers to be know that LE is a very real side effect  and that not enough is done to educate women.Frankly, I think most health care professionals don't know enough about it or minimize its impact.

It consists of bodyweight exercises and interval training. I want this to work and want to protect my arm at the same time.
