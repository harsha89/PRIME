She was the most red dog I had ever seen. Extremely smart, and the most loving creature I ever met. It was love at first sight. I was lucky enough to work in an industry where I could bring her with me. Not to sound like one of those people with perfect children to hear them say it, but my dog is perfect.i feel for those who have been thru this and going thru it now.i have no children but not to compare a dog to a kid my dog is the closest thing I have to a child I feel for all those be it the loss of a child or animal as this s dog has opened my eyes and heart like I never dreamed . She has only 3 - 6 months to live according to her doctors and has been only one week since I have got the news that she has the worst kind of cancer. That a dog can have, thanks for allowing me to write my story as it helps me a little as I can't tell it without crying and people are unable to understand what I am saying as they I cry so much all they hear are cancer and die. Thanks for this site to allow.me to post part of my.feelings as jumbled as they may be",
