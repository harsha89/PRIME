As I can't remember the exact drugs at this time, I do recall it will be one TX every 3 wks for 4 rounds. Then I will begin radiation....I have not yet met with the rad onc, I do that next monday, though the med onc said rad would be daily x6 or 7 wks...ughhh....Then on to a final round of chemo weekly....for what I believe him to have said 12 fricken weeks (only he left the fricken part out... lol)! This week thurs I have an appt to do the PET scan then on friday do the CT, bone scan, and ekg... WOW....gonna have a busy week! Hope to heck I don't have too bad of SE's!! I am still off work on surgical leave....so will be kinda nice to see how the chemo is gonna affect me prior to returning to work!  I am glad there is a group to come back to daily as this is what has been keeping me \"positive and educated\" since my diagnosis on 6/28! Good luck and hugs to all that are begining this week, last week, or next week......we WILL beat this!!",

It is so comforting, supporting, and uplifting. I'm glad I found it! In the middle of May I found a lump in my Left breast and immediately called my doctor. A mammogram and sonogram was ordered. Those results showed \"A-typical\" but recommended I have a follow up in 4 months. I wasn't satisified with the \"wait game\" and demanded a biopsy just to make sure. On 6/28/10, I received that awful call from the breast specialist advising it was cancer, ILC. She scheduled an appointment to see me the following week then scheduled me to meet with the plastic surgeon and her again the following week. My husband and I had discussed prior to meeting the plastic surgeon that we were certian we wanted bilateral mastectomies as this pain was too much to handle a second time perhaps somewhere down the line. We remained as positive as possible, as we had throughout since finding the lump, with each piece of news being yet another slap in the face. On 7/20/10 I had surgery, removing both breasts with reconstruction started at the same time. Within a few days, another phone call was received advising it was metastatic to my lymph system! A week following surgery (Sunday) I called my surgeon as I noticed a reddened area on top of my breast that was warm to touch, of course I feared infection. I went to see him first thing on Monday. Infection? no......his comment was \"didn't you notice this black tissue?\" Ummmm, well, this is actually my first time I have had a mastectomy and actually, it looked as though it was the bruising from surgery....afterall, he wouldn't have seen the \"black tissue\" had he not taken off the steri-strips! Needless to say, I am scheduled to go back into surgery in the morning (tuesday) to have the dead tissue removed. This will of course prolong my recovery.....I was just getting to where I could raise my arms half way and looking forward to the JP drains being removed this week! I have an appointment scheduled to meet with the Oncologist on the 9th which I am actually looking forward to to finally maybe be able to understand the \"Big Picture\" from one person rather than trying to put the pieces together from many!  This past couple of months has changed my life as I knew it, dramatically! I know that God doesn't give us more than we can handle, but he sure knows how to challenge us! This has made my husband and I stronger and closer. It has taught us that it's OK to lean on others and call for help!  Thanks for listening to \"my horror\" and understanding i'm too a \"newbie\" here! I hope to offer as much kindness and support in the future to others as I have read from all of you! Thanks and God Bless!

I have a few questions I will include before closing that I hope others can help me with! Marriedblis- my pathology reports weren't near as good as what the BS had told me prior to surgery, but then how could she \"really\" know before all the tests were completed. They also weren't as good as what the BS nurse had called and reported. They advised my growth (or tumor) was very large at 7cm which, according to the NP put me up into stagelll due to the size. There was no cancer found in the right breast, though a benign cyst was removed. Although the news was worse than expected, my husband and I left her office actually feeling better than when we went in. I think it had to do with finally getting a straight answer? Or maybe it was the fact that we talked to the nurse practitioner who really was very well educated on the disease, moreso than my BS! She took the time to explain things in detail which was a tremendous help! This has been hard for me to grasp and I have found myself putting more and more in Gods hands instead of trying to carry the load and handle it all myself! I am 43 years old and still have two early to mid teen aged sons at home. I decided later in my life to fulfill a chilhood dream and become a nurse, of which I did, graduating with an Associates Degree in Nursing at 39 yrs old. I still have student loans I'm paying on! I ask myself often.....why me? I question what I could have done so wrong in my life to have to be going through this at such a young age?! It is very frustrating but I have come to terms with the fact that we can not change the diagnosis at this point but to work hard and FIGHT it to the best of our/my ability....and then of course hope for the very best outcome possible....no cancer! I go back to the plastic surgeon tomorrow and hopefully get my drains taken out....then to the Oncologist on monday. That is now my biggest worry... the body scans.....I hope and pray they come back negative, that this has NOT metastisized anywhere else! I think I can only mentally handle one thing at a time right now! Stay strong and keep fighting! We WILL get that big prize in the end!!! My thoughts and prayers are with you! Questions:    I have read several posts on here and many of them referenced \"cold caps\" which aided in hair not falling out. Can someone provide me with more information on these....perhaps how they are used and where you can purchase them? Next, I am unsure when I will be starting my treatments though I don't see it being too far in the future and I would like to be supplied prior to rather than when it is despirately needed! When it comes to radiation, what is the best cream to use to the radiated area to hopefully prevent too much skin damage? Do many of you work while receiving chemo and/or radiation?  Thanks for all your continued support, comfort and well wishes! I feel truly blessed to find such a great place for continued support!",

On friday when I met with the plastic surgeon I was scheduled to follow up in 2 wks for expansion (adding fluid to the TE's)....I asked at this time the possibility of not being able to continue with reconstruction due to radiation....he said there was a 50/50 chance of it not working....sounds like yours turned out fine? Did you start reconstruction immediately following mx surgery? Thanks again.....any and all help is appreciated and greatly encouraged as well as needed!",

One was removed after a week only because it started coming out on its own and the bulb would not hold suction. It did not hurt when removed. Today I went through a 2nd surgery due to dead tissue and the need to remove it, the 2 drains that I still had were replaced with new ones. I have a follow up appointment this friday and am hoping the drains will be removed then, which will be 2 1/2 weeks with them in! Ughhhhh.....I have a low pain tolerance and I find they hurt terribly when touching, cleaning, moving, stripping, etc....looking so forward to getting rid of them! As for healing time (or getting back to normal), as many have told you, it depends on the person. I am two weeks to the day since my mastectomies with lymph node removal on the Left side. I had just started using my arms somewhat. However, following this surgery, my surgeon met with my husband to provide an update and told him I am NOT to be raising my arms! So, I guess that means my progress will be slowed for a while. Good luck to you! You have came to a wonderful site that has been very comforting, supportive, caring, compassionate, and full of knowledge! I love it here!",

Yesterday was my first chemo session....I met with the med onc prior to the administration of chemo and broke down crying when the nurse kept talking to me about my hair falling out...and then donating it....WTH? I was more concerned about the physical side effects and the treatment regimen. Well...needless to day, it didn't go bad at all but I did go from taking absolutely NO medicines to having about 10 bottles sitting on my counter at this time....ughhh. I had a bit of a rough night with nausea and diarrhea and a huge headache which lasted into this morning. I had an appointment at 11am in a town about 1 1/2 hrs away so had to venture that trip feeling like crap. Though after the test was over, about 2 hrs worth, my husband and I went to lunch and I actually ate a cheese burger and fries.....hmmmm hope that doesn't come back to bite me in a while! I am pretty tired, has been a long day, maybe another side effect or maybe just all the constant running lately with this appointment and that test, etc. I have one last appointment at 7am in the morning (ct scan, bone scan, and ekg) with the last test scheduled at 2:30pm... will be another long one but then the weekend to rest....I hope that will be it for my se's...immediately following rather than lingering! To those that have had more than one treatment: do your side effects change with each treatment or do they seem to be pretty consistant? ",

I know I will not be able to return to work for those long hours but hoping maybe work 4 days a week so I can have 3 in a row off following treatment. You are so fortunate to have a radiation location so close to work! From what I'm understanding from all the reading, radiation seems to be easier to allow one to work. Did your oncologist suggest or are you on any special diet? I was fortunate enough today to be provided a cookbook designed by a physician especially for cancer patients.....it gives different foods/recipes for different SE's you may be experiencing.....I love it already, it is so full of information! Please keep me posted as well on your progress.....you too are a great, positive influence for me as well! Best Wishes & Take Care!! Cindy",
