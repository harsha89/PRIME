Then a month ago he again felt my breast & insisted it was not normal, that the lump was bigger. This time, it caught my attention I realized he was right. I went in for a physically breast exam and the dr referred me for a diagnostic mammo & us. They were considered \u201cnon cancerous\u201d, but the radiologist could also feel the thickened area. With no explanation or closure I was referred to a breast specialist. I\u2019ll go in two weeks. My question Right now is probably super simple, but I can\u2019t seem to find the answer. I know many of you are knowledgeable & I would love your help. My breast are very dense. However, this area of thickening is new & seems to be getting larger. My question is can glandular tissue or thickened tissue just appear? I asked about common non cancerous causes & all the dr said was that in the us it looked normal. He could see nothing \u201ctoday\u201d I am young- 33, healthy, only risk factors are family history & dense breast tissue. I know that 80% turn out to be nothing. Do I just wait to see if it gets even larger?! I just don\u2019t know. Thanks for any help! Log in to post a reply",
