    "Content": "Dec 17, 2014 10:43AM - edited Dec 17, 2014 11:02AM by Susie_Maryland My BS used a kind of timed-release regional anesthetic called Exparel, which gave me over 3 days of pain relief. I have terrible nausea and vomiting with any opioids, so she thought this would help me for the first few days after surgery without having to resort to the oxycodone. I have to say, it worked GREAT for me. After it wore off on about day 4 after surgery, I was able to get by with extra-strength Tylenol for the next few days, and since then haven't taken anything.",
