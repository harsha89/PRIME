    "Content": "Row wrote: I made my annual mammogram appointment on 10/31/16. The radiologist ordered for more mammogram exam on my right breast then waited a while in the waiting room. I was taken to another room for a 3D ultra sound. I was asked to get dressed and wait for the radiologist. She informed me that they found a lesion that was a little over a centimeter. I was indisbelief and cried. They scheduled a biopsy on 11/4/16. The radiologist told me that the lesion was cancerous. I sat in the parking lot for a while and cried. I met with our surgeon on 11/10/16. My fianc√© and I decided to move up our wedding day to ensure medical coverage . After long days of building enough courage to tell my daughter 27, my son 24, my step son 19, my mom, family and friends, we shared the news to them. I informed my nurse practitioner of my decision to have bilateral masectomy. We got married on 11/14/16. I had my genetic gene testing on 11/17/16. I had my MRI on 11/19/16. MRI results shows two more lesions, one more on my right breast and one on my left breast. I met with my plastic surgeon on 12/1/16 and I decided to have a silicon transplant. I also met again with my surgeon on 12/1/16 for my pre-op for the bilateral masectomy. I received confirmation on 12/2/16 for a surgery date for Tuesday, 12/20/16. I have been anxious. I have been crying. I'm very scared. I have been restless. My Faith in God keeps me hopeful, loved, strong, focused and more. Log in to post a reply",
