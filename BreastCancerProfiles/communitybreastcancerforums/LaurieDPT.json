Now it comes and goes. I also got the Neulasta on Sunday. I\u2019m going to use Alleve today and Claritin. Good to know you can take them preemptively. I will start them earlier next time. Amazing that the nurse did not know about the side effects. Colace has been effective. I was afraid to take it at first because I was told I could either have diarrhea or constipation so I bought both Colace and Imodium. I needed the Colace. I am getting an infusion every three weeks. Five more treatments to go. I heard that weeks two and three are easier. Has that been anyone\u2019s experience?",

I found two soups that do appeal to me - lots of flavor - pasta fagoul from Olive Garden and homemade chicken noodle soup. Hope you can find some favorites too. My hairdresser, whose husband had cancer and who sponsored a hair donation fund raiser for me, suggested using the cool setting on my blow dryer when I need to style. She cut my hair a wash and go cute shor style and I\u2019m thankful for your suggestions. I still like to style it sometimes. I was given extra strength Tylenol for my infusion headache. No effect. I understand alternating Aleve and Tylenol could be more effective. Shopping for Aleve and ginger drops tomorrow. I appreciate this group and your support.",

When I mentioned them to the nurse she said you must be hungry that's why you have a headache and I gave you something for nausea so you shouldn't be nauseous. So it looks like I'm on my own here. Looking for ideas from you all. I have found this form to be extremely helpful. No one understands like someone that's been through it!",

I am a teacher and was able to complete teaching through the school year by having the chemo Friday mornings and recovering over the weekend. For me the first 3 days I am not focused and feel Ike I have a mild flu. It is manageable. The anti nausea meds can be effective and if they aren\u2019t, ask for something else. Be sure to speak up. I had mild neuropathy which has increased every session. My blood sugar went from normal to dangerous. I was told, \u201cCMF doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d When I insisted they take a look at my blood sugar numbers, they figured out it was the steroids they give with the infusion to help the nausea meds be more effective. The high blood sugar caused mild hallucinations which \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen with CMF\u201d. Depending on your treatment team, they may or may not be familiar with all the side effects of all the medications. This site has been a godsend. Let us know how you do.",

Saw the doctor and he is reducing the steroids since the brain fog was so extreme I was seeing things. Just the first day, but it was alarming. He is also changing The type of anti-nausea medicine since I was nauseous before The infusion was finished. I have genericZofran. Week two All I needed was some ginger drops. I have been using the Cerave which I like. My hair is thinning after just one round. I'm surprised it started so soon! I hope to keep my hair as well. Side effects come and go. Some days I'm energetic, other days mild nausea and fatigue hit unexpectedly. I teach three days a week and so far I haven't missed a day. So thankful! Encouraging that round two might be less stressful or maybe I'll just know how to handle it.better. Do you recommend starting Alev two days before the infusion?",

I appreciate your sharing your experiences because you are a little farther down the road than I am. It is particularly encouraging that your round three was less difficult. Everyone\u2019s experiences are different and it is good to know it can get easier. Ditto the weird food cravings. I ate a red velvet cupcake with 2 inch high cream cheese frosting yesterday. I can\u2019t do that normally. So much frosting. UGH... Loved every bite :-) I cleaned all the hair out of the shower drain yesterday and cried. No one but my hairdresser and I can tell.
