    "Content": "momscaregiver825 wrote: My mom was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer in April 2007; the cancer is also in her lymph nodes, spleen, liver and bones. She underwent a hormonal chemo treatment and it was successful in destroying the cancer. She was then on Femara for six months; in February the  Femara stopped working and the onco tried Falsodex, Gemzar, Taxol and the lastest Xeloda. She was on her third round of Xeloda (3,000 mg. per day) when the diarrhea started and her hands which were turning very dark started to bother her with a constant itching. This past Monday she was admitted to the hospital because her potassium level was extremely low and she had diarrhea since Thursday. She had been on the BRATS diet with no results. She came home on Friday and today she looked much more like herself. The onco told us he could reduce the Xeloda to 2,000 mg or try another type of chemo.  She has decided she will not take the Xeloda. We see him on the 3rd and I would like to know if anyone has tried a treatment that you can recommend for me to research prior to her appointment.
