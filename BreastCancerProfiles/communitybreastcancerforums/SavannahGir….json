I guess everyone is different. I too am having tissue expanders.  I wish I had an idea of how long it takes before I can expect to be able to do even basic things, I've read that you shouldn't even be lifting anything heavier than a newspaper for some time and that it takes weeks before you can really lift your arms. I'd like to know how long before I can get back to even a semi-normal routine.....light housework, driving etc. Thanks terri for your information!  Best of luck to all. Kathy",

      "Content": "Sep 14, 2009 11:28AM - edited Sep 14, 2009 11:29AM by SavannahGirl Hi Everybody, I made the decision to do chemo this past Friday after a second meeting with my oncologist; my oncotype DX score was 24 and so I was smack in the \"grey\" area. I've gone back and forth so many times I feel like I have whiplash. It's been far more anxious a time than it was to have a double mastectomy, that's for sure. I'll be having 4 cycles of Cytoxan/Taxotere. I am petrified by the unknown and by some of the accounts I've read about side effects that never go away. I'm trying to stay positive but the bottom line is that the research at this point doesn't even guarantee any \"benefit\" from chemo for women in my range, and it cites an improvement of only a few percentage points. At the end of the day, I've decided to have the chemo and hope for the best. Friday 9/18 will be my first treatment. Wishing all of you great results. Kath",

Your feelings and anxieties are completely legitimate.  Waiting for tests, then results, is horrid. The imagination is a powerful thing and it is only human to fear the worst. Never in my life have I experienced the sheer terror and panic attacks that I have since I was diagnosed June 12.   Three weeks ago today I had a bilateral mastectomy with tissue expanders. Next week I meet with an oncologist to discuss the next step, which will depend heavily on the results of an oncotype DX test that's being done now.  I don't want chemo but I will do what I have to do to give myself the best possible chance of living a long life.  You will get through this, I know you will. Each time I came to this site when I was first diagnosed, I would try to read and would inevitably have an anxiety attack. It's only recently that I have been able to spend any amount of time here or on other sites. It takes time to process everything and as someone else said, once you have a plan you will feel better.",
