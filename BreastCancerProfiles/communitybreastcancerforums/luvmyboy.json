      "Content": "luvmyboy wrote: hi all,  i've been monitoring some masses in my left breast this past year with semi-annual mammo and sono, and recently decided to see a surgeon for added oversite (mom was diagnosed early). Because of the family history and my density (breast :), she recommended an MRI with and without contrasts.  She just called to say that the MRI of the left side continues to be consistent with fibroadenoma, but that the radiologist would like a mammo and sono of right breast. I haven't had one of the right side in a year, and that was my first. She sees what my surgeon called \"clumped enhancement deep inside,\" but she also noted that it has benign kinetics.  I have read about the higher rate of false positive with MRI, or rather that it picks up other non-malignant things, but can anyone speculate what clumping might suggest?  Many thanks, and warm hugs to you all.   Log in to post a reply",

I know several others will post and tell you that the chances are still extremely high that whatever they see is benign.  I have 4 benign fibroadenomas in one breast, that caused me to have a second mammo, sono, and mri.  in the end, they decided they were all likely to be fibroadenoma, not cancerous. Of course the mri showed something in the OTHER breast that is making me worry, but my point is, there are plenty of things that show up that are not cancer.  Search on Beesie, she has great info on this.  I'm not telling you to relax, because I share the fears, but I am telling you what I have learned about the probabilities.  Hang in there.  K",

I may just reach out to my mom's onc. he is actually her former onc, mom has since moved out of state.  I don't feel comfortable worrying her about this yet. she is dealing with pretty extensive mets herself right now, and I don't know how she will take it if I am diagnosed.  So, while she probably has the best advice for me, i don't feel like I can tell her yet.  She is pretty fragile these days.  Again, thanks for your response and encouragement!  I hope all is going well for you right now.   K",

I panic to think about the implications of cancer on him.  Today was particularly tough with those thoughts.  Common to so many of us, I know.  One more day to get through. Of course, they will probably order a biopsy next and the waiting game will continue.  At that point, i'm getting some xanax!

It has been a year since that side was mammo'd.  I'm the kind of person who will go nuts if I don't have a plan.  Making my plan makes me calmer.  Can anyone tell me what my first steps should be?  Right now, I have the breast surgeon following me, and a new GYN. They are from a local group, not a big breast center.  Should I be pursuing setting up a second opinion somewhere?  Sloan Kettering is close by.  Should I be trying to line up an oncologist or is that premature?  My mother had breast cancer and I know her oncologist...  Who makes the recommendations regarding your overall plan, an oncologist or a surgeon?  Am I totally nuts to be thinking about this at this point?   thanks for any advice!
