It practically doesn't hurt, the hardness that  covered the side of my breast almost completely has shrunk to a small ball and it's not boiling hot as it was. He says that such a quick response to only 48 hs on antibiotics indicates infection. I told him about IBC but he ruled it out. Anyway, just to do things right, I'll see him again next week and he'll ask for a mammography, a sonogram and of course, if things are not perfectly all right next week, further tests. Having a family history of cancer (my mom,my aunts on my mother's side and some of my cousins all had breast carcinoma - only one cousin died, the rest had the tumors removed or, in my mother's case, a mastectomy and recovered after different treatments) I think I have to be really alert. My doctor said I shouldn't be so scared but it was good that I seeked medical attention quickly. Thank you very much for your answer Faith and good luck with your surgery. Majito",

I've been on antibiotecs just for 24 hours so I shouldn't expect any improvement at this point. I'll let you know as soon as I know something. I see you are undergoing surgery in February... best of luck! Majito",

I think this forum is great (been reading a little) I'm from Argentina and in spite of the fact that we have very good health centers and specialists, the idea that \"if it hurts you shouldn't worry\" is still very popular (too popular) among doctors. I've just learnt it's not true. Any strange thing in a breast should be paid attention to but women generally shrug it off by saying \"it's nothing\". I belong to an infertility forum here in Argentina which is very good. The more experienced ones (like me, unfortunately) try to give a hand to those who are just beginning and in many cases you come across doctors you can't believe! And when you face them with the \"I read that...\" they get really angry. It's not a question of challenging what doctors say all the time, it would be crazy, but being informed and knowing about what they are doing to you  and what others are doing in the same situation is essential. In particular when your life is at risk. All the best again! Truly!!! Majito",

My breasts are quite swollen and my right breast (the one of the mastitis) is full of cysts. According to the doctor who performed the tests, none of them are to worry about but there's a tiny one that looks kind of suspicious. There are signs of vascularization in the ecodoppler and the cyst contour is a bit irregular. The doctor told me there's nothing to worry about but that she would like me to undergo \"treatment\" and then go back to see what's going on with the cyst after treatment. I have no idea what she meant by \"treatment\" but I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow, who is a breast pathologist, and he'll tell me, I guess. I told the doctor who saw me today about my fear but she said no to worry. She said she would be worried if I hadn't responded to the antibiotics. She also said: \"If I were worried about this cyst, I would ask for it to be drained. I don't think is necessary\" So, I'm more scared than I should be, I suppose. Except for dysplasia, I had never had anything that worried me before.",

      "Content": "majito wrote: Hi! I'm 44 years old and 4 days ago, after removing my bra, I felt a terrible cramping pain in my right breast. My breasts have been quite tender lately due to some pills I'm taking and I'm used to having enlarged, tender breasts after ovulation and when I'm on IVF cycles (been trying to have a baby for 7 years) Yesterday I noticed an oval, red shape on the right side of my right breast. It's hot and painful. I went to the walking clinic in a nearby hospital and the doctor, after examining me, diagnosed me with an infection. He gave me antibiotics, one every six hours and told me the condition should get a little better in between 48 to 72 hours. If it wasn't so, I should go back or contact my doctor, which I have already done. My doctor said the treatment was OK, was surprised about the infection (I'm not breasfeeding) and he said that if I didn't notice any improvements tomorrow morning, I should go and see him. I was fine with the diagnosis but this morning a friend told me about IBC and I have to say I'm scared. Honestly I feel a little silly about it but I prefer to make a fuss and make sure I get the right diagnosis. My question is: can IBC begin by this kind of reddish, hot stain on my breast? I've read a bit about it and they talk about the whole breast beeing swollen and red, which is not my case. I don't have any other symptoms, except for soreness all over my shoulder area, down to the back, but I guess that's tension (my back and neck are usually sore due to tension and lack of exercise) I'll see the doctor tomorrow but I would appreciate an answer. Thank you! Majito Log in to post a reply",
