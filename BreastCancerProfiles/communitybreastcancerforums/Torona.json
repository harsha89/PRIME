Postoperatively, I did have a huge hematoma that took almost 3 weeks to go down, so now the bs thinks I have an infection from the residual hematoma.   He gave me a script for Clindamycin 300 mg 4 times a day for 20 days!!  I'm wondering if this will interfere with my chemo among other things. Anyone else have something similar happen?  I am concerned and would love to hear from someone.  ",

I am worried about the after affects. I am a very independent person and don't like having to ask for help or accept it.  I'm better at it since I had a really bad time last summer with 2 back surgeries followed by a postop infection and was really bed-ridden. My mom stayed with me 2 months and I hate to put her through this, too!  I guess God was preparing me for something bigger!  I have been encouraged by this thread and feel that I can do it! Lisa, I feel exactly the same way - that the chemo makes me feel like a cancer patient now.  I am terrified of the se's and I am upset about the hair thing!  Didn't think it would bother me that much. Hope to stay tuned to this thread and learn more.  Thanks!",

I have been reading furiously all the info. I can to be prepared and based on an earlier recommendation about a great book, I ordered \"Breast Cancer: Real Questions, Real Answers\" by Dr. David Chan. Just wanted to share what he says in his book about some of the subjects discussed here earlier: Cold caps - \"don't try to prevent or reduce hair loss by using an ice cap to reduce blood flow to your scalp during chemo.  There have been reports of cancer recurring within the scalp from use of this technique.\" Fluids - with Cytoxan \"you can avoid bladder irritation by drinking 2 quarts of fluid after the Cytoxan infusion is complete and urinating every hour until you go to bed.\" This amount of fluid/urinating has to be done on each day of your Cytoxan treatment only and not throughout the week.  He recommends Gatorade-type drinks because they have a good electrolyte balance.  He also cautions not to OVERDO fluid intake because taking too much fluid can make you ill by lowering sodium levels in your blood.  Just wanted to share what I read - not sure until I live through it whether it works or not! Good luck to all 4 of us tomorrow, Sanaisa, Brie and Anita. Hope we have good news to report the next couple of days!",

Expected to have my 1st meltdown - instead, had a surprisingly enjoyable time trying on a couple and I bought a really cute one.  My insurance will pay up to $250.00.  Still don't know how I will handle the falling out vs shaving thing.

Got all my meds from the pharmacy today and I did get Emend (really expensive but hopefully will be worth it), Ativan, Decadron, Zofran along with all the other OTC meds mentioned in the chemo list.  Found everything except a satin pillow case - anyone have ideas about where to look? BTW, my onc said definitely get the flu shot - I will as soon as it's available.  I work in a hospital and we can get one free.  Also have an appt.

My entire visit was 1 hour.  Pleasantly surprised with their efficiency. I had my 1st of 33 treatments today and I was in and out in 15 minutes. Really easy and no problems.  Techs said I probably wouldn't see any redness for about 5 weeks.  I go every week day at 4:00 p.m. so I can come home and rest afterwards.  So far so good.

It's called a Skin Cooler.  It comes in a roll that you deep in the fridge and cut to the size you need to apply to radiated area following rads 20-45 minutes.  I don't know if it works or not.  I found mine at a Women's boutique but I'm attaching a link if anyone is interested www.lindiskin.com.  Every little bit of advice is so beneficial.  I too, read the recent study about 1 glass of wine before rad keeps your skin from burning.  Good luck!",
