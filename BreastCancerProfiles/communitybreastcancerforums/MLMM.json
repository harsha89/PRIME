      "Content": "MLMM wrote: Hello everyone, I am new to this list. I am the caretaker for my mother who is currently battling breast cancer with mets to the liver and bone. This is recurrent cancer. Her first cancer was stage 1 non invasive breast cancer which she had in 2004. They thought they got it all.  This time it's stage four invasive. She has taken five rounds of chemo (red devil) and, according to the recent scans, the liver mets are gone and the bones mets are almost all gone. She is HR negative, so she has to stay on chemo. She is 63 years old. She was dx in April of this year.  There have been many, many confusing things about her diagnosis, but the the thing I am currently confused about is her ascites. From what I understand, the doctor thinks it is coming from her cirrhosis. See, when her liver scans came back after her five rounds of chemo, the doctor noticed she had what appears to be cirrhosis. We don't know how this developed. My mom has never drank nor had hepatitis, so the cirrhosis is a mystery.  I know that ascites is usually a really bad sign and heralds a bad prognosis.  Has anyone had ascites that eventually went away? My mom's ascites comes and goes. Sometimes it is fairly large, but then it usually goes back down. Her liver counts are almost normal and her liver appears to be functioning ok. Sometimes her ankles swell also. But often it is just her stomach.  She also is always running a fever that the doctors have never been able to diagnose. They just call it tumor fever, even though they think it runs too high for it to be tumor fever (sometimes up to 101 or 102). She has been in and out of the ER, but they can't find any infection.   Although she sometimes has bad days, she is still able to care for herself and has little to no pain. Fatigue is her main symptom. Up until a few weeks ago she was still working almost everyday.   If anyone has any thoughts on any of these subjects I would love to hear them.  I research everything I can, and I ask the doctor many questions, but we seldom get answers. He sometimes seems annoyed with my many questions, and  he is overworked and I don't think he is used to patients and caregivers being as inquisitive as we are.   Any information about any of these subjects would be appreciated. And, one last question: is acites always a sign that the disease is getting worse? As I say, the doctor first discovered the ascites when he discovered that the liver mets appeared to be gone.   As her caretaker, I want so badly to retain hope that she can live with this disease under control--at least for a while.    I appreciate any information anyone would be willing to share about acites, cirrhosis and mets, how to get more information from the doctors, etc.  Thank you in advance.   Log in to post a reply",

She has run a fever on and off since the beginning of her diagnosis, so I certainly do hope it is from the tumors dying!!   I agree about checking into other doctors. I want my mom to do that, but she does not seem to want to. We live in a semi-rural area. Going to see another doctor would mean many long drives into larger cities and she wants a doctor near her home so that she can be near her family and her church. I can understand that, but I also want her to get the best care possible. I have asked her several times to consider getting another opinion, but right now I can not convince her. Up until recently I was very happy with this doctor. We began going to this doctor as a 2nd opinion. Her first doctor (a surgeon) somehow misread her first scans and originally told us that she did not have mets. Luckily, this doctor caught his mistake.  So, he has been very good to us. I agree, he is a great doctor for someone who does not want lots of information. As a researcher by profession, I want as much information as I can get! haha.   I do so appreciate your post. Hearing from other people, and hearing that others are living with stage IV gives me hope. Hearing that others have lived with ascites for long periods also gives me hope. Hearing other people's stories is so helpful!!!  Thank you again!!!  ",

Her last scan showed that her liver mets were gone and mets to bones were almost gone. She just had a new CT done this past week and we will get the results of that scan on Thursday. Problem is, she has been developing ascitis for some time now. She finally had to have some drained this past week. They drained off over 1200ccs the first day (Thursday). She is continuing to drain some off every day--about 300 ccs or so. Yet she is still having swelling in her ankles and thighs. Has anyone out there ever had ascites and have any relevant information or similar situations? From what I read every where, ascites is not a good sign. Yet my mother feels fairly well and is able to move around, eat, laugh, etc.  Any information is much appreciated.   Thanks!  Log in to post a reply",

Her last tests were just about a week ago and they were near normal (just a tiny bit high).  When she was first diagnosed in March, her liver enzymes were WAY high. But after her first treatment, they have hovered around normal. The doctor first discovered the acities before my mom did when he did the CAT scan that showed the mets were almost gone. He was concerned because she had it but was also concerned because he had no idea what was causing it. He also discovered she had cirrhosis, but he was not sure what caused that. My mom has never had a drink (religious reasons) and has no other illness that would lead to cirrhosis. In fact the doctor says he does not even know FOR SURE if it is cirrhosis unless he does a liver biopsy, which he does not want to do because he says it won't change the major problem at hand which is the cancer.  He has mentioned many times that the ascites could come from carcinomatosis, but I can never get a straight answer out of him how we find out if she has that. So much of this has been a big, big mystery. Hopefully we will find out more Thursday.  ",

Luann, I agree. I have asked my mom many times to consider a 2nd opinion, but she does not want to. She says that she hates the idea of having to go through all the tests again. I have pushed her on it, but she does not want to. We would have to go to another state to get another opinion and she also does not want to travel. Any suggestions?",
