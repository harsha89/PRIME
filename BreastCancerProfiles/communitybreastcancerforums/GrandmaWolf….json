In my area there is a WONDERFUl hospice service.  A person can check in and out as needed, to stablize the pain, or be an inhouse resident,  able to have pet's, friends, and more importantly, \"expert\" round the clock care over and above what is available at a hospital.  If Diane's doctors indicated what I am assuming is true, Hospice would give Diane the constant, comfortable care 24hrs, while you work...and come back to give back up care.  It would be a win-win, for the financial situation, and Dianes care, & comfort. I don't know if your area has what I am refering to, but it is worth investigating. If not appropriate now, bookmark it for any future possible resource. It is a hard hard place you both are in.  Diane is fortunate to have you in her corner. with intense empathy Grandma Wolf  aka Dakota",

You provide reassurance for those of us facing bilateral in the near future.  I too am planning, to skip reconstruction & all it's issues. I have in front of me a catalog from the ACS, called \"TLC\".  It has all sorts of products, from wigs, bras and breast forms at a reasonable price.  I am considering contacting my local chapter to see if they can help me out with these issues. I do like the bras I see in the catalog better than some of the websites I have visited. Is there a local chapter near you that you could get advice from other women in your area? Keep us posted on your progress...and thank you for your input. Grandma Wolf  aka Dakota",

My daughter would call, and stop over once a day to see what I needed.  I had a visiting nurse stop twice to check the dressing and drains. I was able to shower, and do the usual daily type things, there was no rush to do anything.  Had some good books, and took a lot of naps for the first week.  Discomfort was controlled with a tylenol...no real pain.  Sensitive skin, and chest tightness continue, but I am back to work.  I can only speak for myself, but reading a lot of these postings, I know I am not unique.  Just get as much info as you can,,, ask the Dr, and nurses what to expect, and have help nearby \"in case\" you need it.  I found the following YouTube video discussion on drains.  Just copy and paste the link into the address field of your browser if it doesn't work by clicking on it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvMgjBtGsOc Keep us posted, and best of luck Dakota",

I qualify to answer.  Like yourself, I am 65, and not in a relationship. I had a bilateral 2 1/2 weeks ago.   I thought it would be harder than it is looking down at a flat chest.  I know I can reconstruct at any time in the future, but now on this side of the surgery I have to wonder why I would go through all of that trouble for something that would look good in clothes, but have no feeling?  I don't look \"bad\" in clothes, even flat, and with decent prothesis, no one would know if they were reconstructs, or add ons.   As for the possibility of meeting someone in the future, I don't think if the person were the type to let boobs interfer with an otherwise good relationship, he would be the person for me.  Ahem, I do have \"other\" skills. Yes, there maybe times I will miss them, they were good looking boobs for a woman my age... but hey those puppies were trying to kill me as they were drooping toward the floor.  I really like the idea of tattos to fill in the \"blank\" slate.  I have seen some very interesting ones, but will need to wait at least a year. Here's hoping you come to a comfortable decison that suits what feels best for you. Dakota",

However, from what you just described, it may be just a matter of time if you can just hold out.  My younger sister went thru reconstruction a year after her surgery.  It did take almost about a year of discomfort, etc, etc.  Her ps was totally upfront and honest with her about the process, and the results.  That was over 20 years ago, and she has been glad she did it ever since.   Pehaps a couple more years down the line, you will look back and think all of this is worth it too.  In the meantime, why don't you address your concerns directly to the ps?  IE... mention your surgeon & LE aren't entirely convinced all of this is swelling.  How long can you \"reasonably\" expect swelling to last? Ask directly why he created the size he did after you explained you did not want the otherside augmented.  See if the explainations to yourself are correct.  I think you have every right to know, and \"understand\" what is going on.  If you don't, it is his duty to inform you.
