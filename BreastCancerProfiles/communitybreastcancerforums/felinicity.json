I've had almost no pain at all and certainly have not had to take any pain killers. The most sensitive part was the nipple which can only be nerve pain but it has been maybe one moment a day. I have full and complete movement of everything all the time and no skin sensitivity. One area of my breast is numb and when the dressings were taken off, the nurse said I have extremely bad bruising - but  no pain around the breast or underarm, incisions or not. The numbness is reducing quite quickly. A pain I have begun to acquire is, I think, a tendon or ligament in my upper arm which began as a sore spot and now can stretch down to the wrist but it's certainly not agonising or even severe. It was looking for a reason for that which brought me to this page - I like to know what's happening and adjust to suit. It goes away if I do the exercises - and they are essential, three or four times a day - not just for now as I understand it, but also for the later radiotherapy treatment to be able to move the arm/shoulder into position.  The hospital nurse thought the old bras I'm using are perfect - they are Berlei and designed to fit the body without any undue pressure or bulging. My greatest sympathy to those who are suffering.  I don't have a lot of time for the information I've been given either but clearly everyone reacts very differently and no-one is able to predict what will happen to whom.",
