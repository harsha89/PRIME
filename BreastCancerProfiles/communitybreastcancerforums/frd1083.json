Got a letter saturday that said they cancelled my appt and rescheduled to feb. 23. So that was it, the flood gates opened and I really cried which I have not done much of. And of course, I am still bleeding from god knows what, long period that stopped and restarted. So I have just about had it. So now what, I am not sure I can wait for another 2 1/2 weeks not knowing what I am dealing with. I am tempted to go back to first surgeon who is not a breast specialist but does do these types of excisional biopsies and had a very nice way about him. I just thought a breast surgeon might be a better option for me. Anyway, I will start calling tomorrow at 8:30 to fight a battle to see if I can at least have an us to see if that shows anything. the mamm did not, just microcalcifications. Any opinions Thanks Faith Log in to post a reply",

Wednesday after meeting with surgeon who was confident I did not have anything I was elated, went to dinner with my husband and breathed a big sigh of relief. She had ordered an ultrasound just to cover our bases, but left the room saying she would see me again in May or June. Yesterday I went to for us and they found lots of cysts but one had debris which caused little concern but another had a good size white blob of calcification in it or nodule. My heart sank, but was so glad I had the ultrasound. I will have a biopsy I believe according to the radiologist who met with me, but I have to go back to surgeon on Tuesday as she has to order what she feels is the best thing to do. I felt better yesterday than today. I just cannot sleep and that is slowing becoming a problem. I work everyday so that has helped keep me busy, but I am just TIRED. I am ready to jump to next phase, but wish I did not have a day of YIPPEE as it is hard to get back. Thanks for listening girls. Have a nice Friday and weekend. Faith Log in to post a reply",

She said it does not scream cancer, but she is concerned. Also cannot take aspirin, what can I take for headache, etc. Thanks Faith Log in to post a reply",

This yr I got the dreaded call back after going 5 yrs with no callback. I could tell the mammographer was struggling to find the spot they were looking at... Anyway birad 3 see you in 6 mos. so I actually called the radiologist to chat. She said I have very dense breasts. Heterogenously dense was noted on some of my reports. I am 59 now and just went into menopause nov 2011 at age 58 but said kinda of like \"looking for a pebble in a snow storm?\". Her response was \"yes exactly....maybe you should think about an MRI\" The breast surgeon that I had 5 yrs ago is very good but at times very dismissive so not sure what to do. They did find new calcifications that were not there last year. So not sure if I should sit tight and give it 6 mos. Sorry this is so long. Any thoughts? Faith Log in to post a reply",
