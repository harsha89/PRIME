Towards end of radiation started with being cold and then somewhat depressed - no interest in doing much but had good energy. Asked family doc to check thyroid and it came back 0.008. I think it's radiation related. Had radiation to suproclavicular the included some area of the right side neck. Unexpected SE but start new med dose tomorrow so hopefully TSH will return to normal level. Sort of need to laugh. If it's not one thing it's another. Don't see the RO until July - all should be well by then for sure.",

Chemo week I took Ativan and Compazine every 8 for 4-5 days and that helped me sleep (plus getting rid of nausea and anxiety). After that Benadryl did the trick for me. I did find myself wide awake at 3 AM and would get out of bed and play computer games for 1-2 hours and then go back to bed. I didn't fight it too much, I just slept when I could. I work from home and some days would find me taking conference calls from bed or catching a quick nap in the afternoon. Working from home was a real plus for me - but my job is always from my home office so that is my normal. Trial and error - but my sisters were pretty adamant that I do everything to control the symptoms before they appear rather then after. It worked for me. I am seven months post chemo and, truthfully, the bad times are fading. It's tough but find your own solution for what works. Somewhere in all these shared experiences you will find something you can try to ease the road ahead.",

I saw my mammo images, knew it wasn't good, knew what was coming, so nothing was really a surprise as it unfolded. The biggest challenge was being the patient on the table instead of behind the control panel. I managed a breast center and knew what to expect every step of the way - - but it was so difficult to apply all the knowledge to me personally. I was used to giving the information to someone else and had no experince in how to receive the info for me. This wasn't professional, it was personal - my two worlds collided. Both my sisters are nurses, one an oncology nurse. They were both wonderful but they struggled applying their skill to me - their sister. It was just an entirely different set of circumstances. We were all much more familiar being on the giving side of healthcare than the receiving end. And, yes, I was terrified (still am on occasion). I did well until chemo started and then took Ativan as needed. What worked for me - I lived in the present. I can't change the past, can't control the future but I could decide for today. It's just one day at a time. One day. You only need to deal with today. And don't bottle up the emotions. Tears are good - just let them flow when needed. I sent email updates to a large group of family and friends and that was my therapy. I found writing down my emotions and documenting my day/week made me put things in perspective in order to make sense in the email. I told them when I had a meltdown and when I had good days. I found humor in lots of things (like the nasal hairs). Our family has always found humor easily and that served me well. I didn't know about these discussion groups at the time but I had several friends with BC and they were very helpful in sharing stories and support. There is a good website, chemocare.org, sponsored by Cleveland Clinic that helps understand chemo side effects. There was another book, Breast Cancer Treatment Handbook by Kneece, that was a huge resource. It was my guide through the process. Even though I knew the process, I needed guidance and that book was my 'what's next' guide. I only read the chapters I needed as the events occurred. Best wishes to you.",

In the US, mammography centers (every site doing mammography) is required to meet regulations set forth by the federal government. Wherever you go for a mammogram, you should see a certificate posted that says the facility is 'FDA Accreditated'. If you don't see the sign, ask if they are accredited. Technologists and radiologists are required to perform an minimum number of mammos annually and continuing education to remain proficient. Ask your tech if he/she is certified and has experience. Once you know your facility has meet all the regulations, you need to realize there are some diagnosis that do not visualize well on mammograms. If you have dense breasts, ask for further testing. Six states have already passed legislation that requires you, the patient, to be notified in your 'lay letter' if you have dense breasts. Those states are: Virginia, Texas, New York, Hawaii, Connecticut, and California. Other states and federal legislation are pending. If you are not in one of those states, you need to call your provided and ask if you have dense breasts. There is a good website dedicated to dense breasts:http://www.areyoudense.org/ Dense breasts increase risk of failing to detect cancer on a mammogram. Be aggressive in pursuing additional testing if you fall into that category.",

Just list all the things you identified above and that will give you a really good start. You can search the articles here on breastcancer.org to get good resource information. I'll try to give some input be you need to realize everyone is unique so you do need to lean on your medical staff for the correct path for your mom. No mammo and how far has it spread - based on the pathology, physical exam and doctor recommendations, there are some tests to help determine if the cancer is spread further. That could be a PET scan or a CT Scan or an MR - you need to trust your docs to recommend what is right for her. Pathology results - you can ask for a copy of the pathology results. It should have ER+, etc. and grade. Staging will most likely be determined by the oncologist when all the tests are in. It's a bit nerve racking but it just takes some time. Most important is to get the process started. Mastectomy or not - the surgeon may have recommendations but you can ask all those questions. My surgeon gave me a book 'Breast Cancer Treatment Handbook: Understanding the Disease, Treatments, emotions, and Recovery from Breast Cancer' by Judy Kneece. You can get it on Amazon. I found this book to be a very good resource. The internet can get overwhelming, this book was great and even lists reputable websites for quality information. It even gives you questions to ask. Your mom is lucky to have you help sort through these details.",

While she works on the oncology floor, the hospital (huge facility that offers everything!) is sadly lacking in lymphedema knowledge/care. Since she just got her BSN I think she needs her CLT and then she can be the director of Women's Health and offer full services!

With this heat, LE seems to like the added water - a good thing. Hugz - you are so right. This past year (surgery was 7/11/11) has been an emotional roller-coaster. Got the big stuff behind me and I had lots of emotion over the LE. However, these past two weeks I began logging my steps, MLD, Flexi, water, heat, and my own LE staging. LOL - as long as I have a spreadsheet where I can track changes I feel like I have more control. I still freak over 'new' situations because of the unknown. I think I got out of an international trip - I was just stressed over the unknown. As I get better with the daily maintenance and exercise I hope I get better facing new challenges. Never really liked to garden but it bugs me that I now have all the LE considerations out in the garden. Sat and Sun morning I was out in the garden - dang it - it's not getting the best of me. I can find a way to do my own chores - it may take me longer to get the work done but I will finish. Gonna get out there for another 20-30 minutes before work in the morning.

I think I need to focus more on reasons to exercise and leave some excuses behind. It helps me be accountable, people applaude the effort I do make, and I am encouraged to do more.   I have the best sisters who support me, but here I found people that understand LE and the 'gifts' that come with it - things I couldn't find in the many books I read. Part of my goal is learning how to manage LE in all circumstances. Those are the unknowns for me so every time I succeed in a 'new' situation it gives me confidence that I do know what I'm doing here. I have all the tools I need, but this discussion helps me figure out when to use which tool. Yesterday I made 4700 steps, morning yard work, MLD twice and lots of water. Managed to control the LE throughout the heat of the day (outside graduation party) so I'm calling it success. ",

I never have asked how long I continue to followup with her - I like her and the staff so I don't mind going back indefinitely. Gonna miss them for the next six months. I see my MO Thursday. Hoping for good lab results.",

I always wear my sleeve when exercising, doing repetitive work that I want to get done (cleaning garage) or during the heat of summer, oh, and I always wear to doctor appts so they think I am compliant.  I do a lot of Lebed type stretches during the day while sitting at my desk and I drink a lot of water, usually 16 oz. daily. Water is my favorite beverage so that is easy, stretching feels good so I do it often. I do need to get better at deep breathing throughout the day. Initally, I was Stage II LE (by my MO) with my forearm and hand showing the most swelling. It took a much time to get my hand to normal but I am fortunate I have not any severe flare ups. I see an LE trained massage therapist as needed and haven't been to PT in over a year. My sister helps measure my arm regularly to confirm everything is as good as I think.   I spend about 20-30 minutes on MLD each night and sometimes longer - depends on the TV show I'm watching :) It took me a year to feel confident I was doing MLD correctly, to know I had the tools/knowledge to manage my LE, and feel a sense of 'freedom' to live my life without fear of an LE flare-up. Coming from a medical background, I had to do a lot of reading to understand the physiology behind LE. Once I had a better understanding of LE I felt empowered to manage it.

At at customer site this week (a hospital) and spent quite some time touring the facility so that was more movement than normal - a good thing. Walked a few blocks from the parking lot to the restaurant last night even though a co-worker offered door service. Just looking for ways to increase movement. I think my arm is looking better than it has in many weeks so all this stuff really does work. I've never been one for exercise so these new routines are a concentrated effort for me.

Parents are 79 & 80 and it's time to do more but it's hard to know how much to do and not infringe on their independence. Dad wants to meet with the siblings to discuss end of life and their wishes. He was in the hospital recently and there were a few scares. While I am glad for the willingness to discuss it is a meeting I don't want to attend. I mean, I will be there I just don't want to face that facts. Kira - I don't have advance directives or a living will.

We are celebrating my sisters graduation with her BSN and our successful completion of this past year. They were with me at every appointment, treatment and were my in-home nurses. We have lots to celebrate. And...I am taking my pedometer and going to start recording my steps. Walking is a bit painful with arthritis and AI joint pain but I'm counting on Ibuprofen to help. I know exercise is the next horizon and the committment of everyone in this thread is encouraging so I'm going to get started. Starbucks are frequent in NYC so those will be our rest stops. Looking forward to a wonderful three days with my two wonderful sisters. I am truly blessed. Now I need to get moving!",

LE care is in addition to my 'normal' life which means something else gives to make room for the new needs/routine. Been fighting the LE changes since they started. I always said I needed a hobby - maybe LE is my hobby and I just need to embrace it. Sometimes it's easy to overlook the victories (water, MLD, etc) when I see all I could be doing. Just like the stairs - it's one step at a time. Since I joined this group I am more motivated to work with LE - not quite so angry about it anymore. lol - my surgery was July 2011 -  not even a year yet! However, my energy is returning with the increased focus on steps which is good thing. Gotta focus on those good things. I was able to walk quickly up the steps to the Chocolate Factory today - that's a victory. Had to run in and buy chocolate to take back to the dentist. His wife has cancer (not breast) and is a few months behind me in treatment. She's at the 'need chocolate' phase. I had the energy today to do something I really wanted to do and enjoyed it!

He is high risk for fall so we girls stay with him 24/7 when admitted. It's just easier then having dad aggravated or fall and break a bone. But it is tiring - just when I think my energy is almost back to normal this comes along and whoops me. Also waiting on thyroid results - that radiation played a game on my thyroid. Had to change my meds post rad tx and I think it's unstable again. It's hot outside and I'm wrapped in blankets and hoodies, I'm weepy, could be contributing to tiredness. What a mess. I still averaged 4800 steps daily - I made dad walk the halls and I used the restrooms at the far end of the hall. Got my water in - MLD each night. Stayed with mom at night so no Flexi or wrapping but the arm seems happy so all is well. Wondering - - should I name my arm? Since this appendage has taken on a life of it's own it seems like it should have a name instead of 'my arm'. I mean, I have a name for my car and my GPS, why not my arm?",

Always more than 6,000 with 9,300 one day! That's not too bad considering I sit behind a desk at least 8 hours a day. Fortunately, I was at Fisherman's Wharf where it is flat - my knees and hills do not go together. All in all - I think it was a successful week step-wise. Just not sure why I gained 3 lbs.! Oh - that's right - probably the bread. First day in town was the Nike Women's Leukemia and Lymphoma marathon. More then 35,000 women walking/running the streets of San Francisco. I was at the Wharf watching the race until most all runners when by - then I headed out walking to Pier 39. About 3-4 blocks behind the last walker/runner was a lady ambling painfully behind a walker. She was 'older' and had her husband/son with her. That lady was a testimony in motion that we have the strength we need to win the race. I don't know if she ever crossed the finish line but she won the race in my book. Yes, I cried. Today, I'm motivated to keep up the steps, drink more water, and lose my San Fran pounds. Look out treadmill, here I come.",

Yesterday, after doing some kitchen work, I sat in front of the TV for a few and did some MLD. Then I did some passive work before resuming the repetitive stuff. I really haven't had pain or swelling for weeks - and I even had a cross-country trip with multiple flights! I know this may not last forever but is sure is nice break after the heat of summer. My arm really does not like heat but seems happy with the cooler weather. I haven't used my Flexi-Touch in a least two months - nice. I'm just enjoying the break.",

No, I have dieted many times. 3) Increase mobility - my joints are old (64 years pushing 65). Docs say I need knee replacements in a few years. I think I can prove them wrong. Yes, I have arthritis but I firmly believe I can decrease the side effects by increasing strength in my legs and losing weight. Okay - those are my goals. I don't have a bucket list. Already did those things before retirement. I wanna be a better me. HELP! Today - pull out the LEBED and get my arm happy. Get out the chair and move!",

If you have access to a nutritionist, make an appointment and find out how much protein you need daily - don't go less than what is recommended for your weight - you probably need more during chemo. Fruit is good - but you need a better diet to help your healthy cells get through chemo.

I actually got the machine before LE became a daily need so I had it early in the program. I'm one year from right MX/node removal and glad I have it. I even took it on my last work trip (drove onsite)- didn't need it but had it with me just in case. It needs it's own suitcase and I plan to carry the machine on board when flying.

The port never bothered me at all, hopefully that will be your experience also. As for chemo, drink lots of water and eat a lot of protein. Your cells are gonna need both. My goal was 80-90 grams of protein daily and 8-10 glasses of water. My labs were always good so was able to stay on my chemo schedule, no delayed treatments , no transfusions. Medical staff thinks the diet was key - at least for me. I admit I was force feeding protein some days and only made 60 grams days - but that is still good. Don't know if this will help for you. I actually met with a nutritionist before chemo who gave me the protein and water goals. If you are anywhere near Akron, there is place called Stewart's Caring Place that offers free nutrition counseling. My first chemo was Aug 27, 2011 and here I am with curly hair and feeling good.

You may be one of the lucky few that never has LE but one never knows just what will trigger an LE flare up, it could be moving boxes 10 years now. Maybe you will never be sensitive to altitude which would be wonderful. Volleymom - you have found a good place to chat. Welcome to the forum. Hope all goes well with your chemo. I met with a nutritionist that helped guide me to the proper diet during chemo. My blood levels were good throughout and I never missed a treatment. You can call Stewart's Caring Place in Akron and schedule a free consult. Good luck to you as you start treatments.",

My surgeon gave me a book that was a great resource for me. It is Breast Cancer Treatment Handbook by Judy Kneece, RN, OCN. You can find it on Amazon for about $25.00. I sat and read the book through (which was overwhelming) and then used it chapter by chapter as my treatment progressed. You will gain much good info on these boards but I found the book a great resource. There is also a list of reputable websites to access for information. With surgery coming soon, you need to know how to care for yourself afterwards. My recommendation is to be cautious with exercise and range of motion exercises the first two weeks after surgery. I started range of motion exercises a bit soon and probably promoted my possibility of lymphedema. You may want to surf through this website for some pre-reading http://stepup-speakout.org/. No one wants lymphedema but if they do a sentinel node biopsy you will be at risk.  You may want to Private Message Carol57 or Binney and ask for their post surgery recommendations. Not everyone gets lymphedema but the risk exists. Best wishes. Keep us posted and always feel free to ask questions.",

There is no proof that MLD through the sleeve is effective but I have been on many flights in the past year and this routine has worked for me. Once at my destination - lots of water and MLD an hour after flight or when settling into hotel. Repeat on return. Have lots of fun. I love the lights.",

I did the Lebed stretching exercises and full MLD before leaving for the airport and wore the compression sleeve and glove.  On the flight I drank a bottle of water (took it on the flight so I could start early). I also did some 'modified' MLD on the flight (as much MLD I as could) and modified Lebed. Both trips had layovers and all went well. I guess it's not the length of the flight but the altitude that makes the difference. I don't like the long flights and don't get many non-stops flights from my local airport. I just use all the tools I have have available and get on with my life. I'm bummed I let the Italy trip throw me into a tailspin.

It is unfortunate those days are gone and there is so much focus on volume - the patient gets lost in the shuffle to stay afloat. Not a good thing but prevalent in heathcare these days. When I go to the doctor I have my list of questions and I don't leave until I get my answers. You need to be an advocate for your own healthcare. Get your films - get a second opinion. Put your mind at rest. When/if you feel another lump get it checked out - never assume the next time it will be nothing. Here's hoping everything really is negative and just normal breast changes.

She isn't certified yet but trained on Vodder which is the basis for her massage. I think she trained at Foldi and believes in using what works best for each client. Not sure what that all means but I know my arm is happier this last week than it has been for months! She will also offer discounts to patients with repeating LE appointments - nice. Her mother had LE so she is understands. I put a bug in her ear that the local hospital is considering an LE clinic. I have referred three BC people to her.
