My right side has been at 45cc - 60cc for the last three weeks. Being very stubborn as no matter what I do it does not want to slow down. I am very frustrated as well. I feel like I have grown another appendage. It is hard to sleep and when I do fall to sleep I don't stay asleep. My doctor plans to pull it on Monday regardless of output because he does not want to risk infection, even though I have been on antibiotics the whole time. As much as I would like the drain out, I am concerned with filling with fluid and the doc having to aspirate me. I was wondering if anyone who has had a mastectomy and gone through chemo has not had to do radiation?",
