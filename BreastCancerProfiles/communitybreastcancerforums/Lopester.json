I am very freaked out.  Does the Aromisin not work for me?  Do I need better doctors?  What am I doing wrong?  My oncologist was missing in action due to health issues and I had to find another.  I have a new doc at Dana Farber but she has goofed up with me a few times more than I want to mention .  I can't keep changing doctors but I am really concerned about the failure of medical oncology for me.
