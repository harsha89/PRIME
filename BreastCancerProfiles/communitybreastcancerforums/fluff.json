The patterns all seem to be made for flat-chested women! You can find some of the ones that have English translations on Amazon.com.    ",

I finally felt ready, but it was still difficult. The first thing I did was adjust my dress form to look like the new, flat me--and that was all I could stand for one day. Then, I adjusted my sloper--which I created less than a year before my surgery--to get rid of the darts. After that, it slowly became easier and somewhere in there I started using those Japanese sewing books. I still am not fully adept at making clothes for my new shape, but I'm coming along. I also have spent a fair amount of time altering clothes in my closet (and getting rid of tons of clothes, too). I haven't had a lot of time to be on these boards, but I have a little more time now and am always happy to talk sewing and flat fashion.",

But it will give you a good idea of what kinds of patterns are available. I think that as interest is growing, there will be more books published with English translations (and lower prices).",
