I'm in the same boat so can totally relate. Chances are it's a fibroadenoma (the kidney bean lump) but should be checked by a doctor. Call your local family planning center and tell them you have no insurance and found a lump. Most family planning centers have free breast screenings and *if* something is found, they can help you decide where to go from there with no insurance. I live in a fairly small town in the middle of nowhere and our family planning clinic does a ton of free breast stuff for woman with no insurance. ((hugs))",

I know the one here has equiptment to screen the breasts and they do it for free or for minimal donation. I agree with the others - head to the ER. If you know you're going to qualify for medicaid, I believe they pay 30 or 60 days retroactive so you shouldn't have to worry about the bill.",

The area of concern started to grow.. same exact symtoms as you at first. My radiologist said the area looked suspicious - wanted to biopsy. My surgeon wanted to wait until after the baby was born (needless to say it was a long 9 months) Had a surgical biopsy - results B9!",
