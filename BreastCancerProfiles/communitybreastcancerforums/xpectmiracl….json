If you have time, consult with a few doctors to find out who you feel most comfortable and confident with. These are some things I did that helped me. I hope that helps. (((hugs)))",

My heart goes out to you with the awful waiting period for test results. Because I opted for mastectomy and my nodes were clear i do not need radiation. I don't know about balloon radiation.

I haven't been working full time, though. I haven't been able to work for a week after each chemo tx.  When I do work, I have 2 days in a row and then 2-3 days off.  On a work day I too am good for nothing the rest of the day after I get home. I think this is normal. I don't know when we will get our energy back. It is nice to work like \"normal\" people. It keeps me from spending my day obsessing about my cancer. I can get out of my head and do something useful. ",

It is getting discouraging because it seems about half the time I am calling in or leaving early sick because of chemo SE. Today I felt fine at the beginning of the shift. I started feeling a little weak and shakey a couple of hours into it. Unfortunately, our computer system went bazzerk and the LPN giving meds on my team was behind because it took her forever to file things. There was one pt in particular who was in a lot of pain and needed some meds. Instead of stopping to rest and eat something I jumped in to help the LPN by administering this pts meds for her. Of course it took me forever to document  and by the time I did sit down to take a break it was about an hour later. The rest and food helped as long as I was sitting in the break room. Once I got back on the floor to see pts again I found that I was shaky and unsteady on my feet. I had my bp taken and it wes elevated. I was wheeled to employee health and my husband was called to pick me up. I don't know what to do! Is it fair to my co-workers to continue to try to work when I eventually call in sick or leave early on a regular basis? Please, I need some feedback on my predicament.",

I tend push myself too when I don't feel good. This cancer has forced me to slow my life down. I have gotten used to doing something, then take a nap; do something else, then another nap. After my first chemo treatment I was not feeling well the night before I had to work. I went in the next morning anyways. Big mistake. I wasn't there 2 hours and I started feeling bad. I must have looked bad, too. My clinical coordinator said I should go home; that the other nurses would take my patients. I felt so bad I started crying. How embarrassing! It was that day that I realized that I don't have the reserves I usually rely on to push through a bad day. I need to slow down.",

I have needed more than the recommended time of for my mastectomy/TE placement and each of my chemo tx. As a nurse in a hospital I am up on my feet and moving alot throughout my shift. What has been your experience? How much time should I ask for off work after my TE exchange with contralateral lift/augmentation sx? ",

Upon reflection, I think the hardest part for me was the second week when my hair started to fall out. Actually, it was the anticipation of it falling out that consumed my brain! After I had my head shaved by my kids (15, 18, 20 yrs) I felt more at peace with it. I mostly go around without anything on my head. Wigs were hot and itchy. The routine for each round was to take steroids before treatment and preventive nausea meds after for a few days. I also got the neulesta shot the day after to boost my immunity system. I had a lot of aching with the first treatment and then heard about taking claritin before and after the shot and had much less aching after that. I had an arsenal of meds for various SE and felt like I was running a pharmacy! I stayed basically in bed for a week after treatment, then the second week was able to get out a little with many naps. Then the third week I felt fairly well; ready for the next round! I agree with the suggestion of getting help with your daughter. Drink lots and rest when you need it. Pushing through fatigue only made it worse and last longer. Hook up with a thread for others starting chemo the same time as you. The support is invaluable! Bless you on your journey!",
