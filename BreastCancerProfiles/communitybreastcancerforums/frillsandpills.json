My mum was diagnosed 15 years ago and although none of us carry the BRCA genes, it runs in the family(her mum, aunt, sister and grandmother). My mum was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in 2008 and has had herceptin for a number of years. We had news earlier this week that the cancer is active again and has spread. I am seriously considering a bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and have been for some time. Has anyone reading this had that procedure and if so, what advice can you give me?
