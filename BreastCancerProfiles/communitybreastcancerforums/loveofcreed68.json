    "Content": "loveofcreed68 wrote: I'll be having 2 core needle biopsies Wednesday on my RB and one FNA on my LB.  The radiologist feels they are all b9 but is more concerned about one in my RB.  I asked if the areas showed any characteristics of cancer and she said no but she could be surprised. My breast surgeon said he would \"bet the farm\" that they're all b9.  He said it's not uncommon for a woman of my age to have things show up. My breasts feel sore constantly.  In late January, I had an infection in my right breast that went away with anti-biotics.  I'm 41, not breast-feeding and haven't had a mammo since I was 30 so there are none to compare to my current one. The ultra-sound showed the nodules had lobulated margins.  My mother had BC at 62.  She's fine now and will be 70 in April.  I know that I should relax, especially because of what the doctors said but can't.  I hear biopsy and my brain thinks cancer.  The radiologist said the nodules can be many things other than cancer but it seems impossible.     Sorry about the rambling.   Just wanted to know if anyone had a similar experience.  I appreciate it.
