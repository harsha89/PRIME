I had been using Calendula cream after every session. I also took a spray bottle filled with water to  every session and sprayed it on the radiated area to cool it down as immediately as possible. Long story short, I made the mistake of downplaying the slight chafing in my armpit midway through the 5th week. On Friday Jan 3, 2014, I had a radiation session that completed 5 out of 6 weeks. Over the following two days, the weekend of Jan 4 & 5, the burning began. My right armpit was so badly burned -- not blistered but sort of a dark reddish grayish purplish color -- that on Sunday the 5th I sent my radiation oncologist a picture of it and expressed my doubt about radiation on that Monday. Her nurse asked me to come in anyway, so that they could advise me on next steps. That day she confirmed that there would be an interruption in the schedule and that we would plan to start again on Monday the 13th. She handed me some Vaseline (PETROLEUM jelly - UGH!) soaked gauze patches and a couple of tube tops. She said to get some Silvadene cream and apply it 2-3 times a day. Then put the vaseline-soaked gauze on at night and the tube top over it. Wash the vaseline off each morning so that it would not prevent the Silvadene from penetrating the skin. All of this was seemingly good advice, but it simply didn't work. The burn got worse on Monday, even worse on Tuesday, and by Wednesday it peaked. And, try to imagine removing gobs of vaseline from a large burn. Rub soap on it? Scrub it with a cloth? Run hot water on it? You choose the method of torture. I quickly abandoned that course and began to chart my own. A reasonably thorough (although pain-wracked) search on the internet on Tuesday convinced me that no one had published how they cracked the code on this problem and that, tragically, some people live in agony with it for weeks. What I needed to do first was to figure out how to stop the intermittent, searing pain that I felt in my armpit (does anything hurt worse than a burn?). I finally took a flashlight and lit up my armpit, moving my arm in every direction. I realized that the un-slathered skin on my arm was dry enough that it was sticking to the burned skin and pulling some of it off every time I moved my arm. So I slathered my under arm with Calendula Cream but I also needed a way to keep from automatically lowering my arm. I took a tennis ball and put it inside the tube top, about 5-6 inches below my armpit. I kept it there night and day for two days. I also took a homeopathic remedy called Boiron's Cantharis 30 (vitamin stores carry it) to start the healing from the inside. By Thursday morning I had stopped wincing and hissing with pain (you know, the involuntary intake of breath) and when I saw my naturopath that day, he recommended a light coating of a mixture of Manuca honey and Alba's Un-Petroleum Jelly (a non-petroleum jelly). I bought both at Whole Foods. All in all, I  regained my sanity over the next 3 days and after a total of two weeks off, completed my last week of radiation without further burning. I hope this helps someone!!",

Best way to avoid nausea during chemo was told to me by my naturopath and it worked. For about 48 hours before you start your chemo session, avoid all animal protein, grains, beans and dairy. You won't starve -- you can eat as much fruit, veggies, eggs, nuts and seeds as you are hungry for. This will allow your bowels to be loose, so that you can eliminate that way instead of throwing up. It is miraculous and I hope you will try it. I had ACT, 8 sessions and only had one bout of nausea before I tried this advice, and then no more nausea!! And I never took any anti-nausea meds at all.",
