I too have run into the same denial and lack of knowledge/concern regarding radiation and chemotherapy nerve damage side effects. I was just as bad as they were, living in denial, and trying to convince myself that \"it\" would eventually go away. I was wrong. It wasn't until I changed my primary care physician 5 years later that I was finally referred to a specialist who sent me for tests to diagnose RIBP & CIPN - ruling out any tumors or other nerve related disease. Let me add, that my new primary care Dr is also a cancer survivor, and she is very attune to symptoms. So, it is extremely important that you persevere, and reach out to a neurologist for appropriate testing. The Internet is indeed our friend and a tremendous aide for information gathering. If any of us can help guide you, or share our own experiences, we certainly will. You've got our support! Please keep in touch and let us know how you progress - stay strong, keep searching. Cindy",

Other than various articles of interest to share.  Getting back into it has been difficult emotionally for me - both my parents passed away last year.  First my Mom, in July, followed in two very short months by my Dad, in September.  This was more difficult than I had ever imagined it would be.  My Dad would love to read anything I wrote.  He would read them out loud to my Mom, as she could no longer see.  Dad would share them with anyone he would encounter.  He always told me he was proud of me.   So, whenever I start to write, I think of that.  Up until now, that was holding me back.   No longer can it be my excuse.  Instead, it will fuel me.  The day to day work load has taken its own toll.  I was fortunate with my employer and management regarding my special needs.  That actually lasted about a year... Changes in desk setup, changes in work hours, working mostly from home.  I have now gone on full disability.  I was a \"worker bee\" pushing through the days and evenings.  Unfortunately, it began to take me 12 hours to complete 8 hours of work.  The stress becoming more and more concerning.  It's taken me several months to get used to not forcing myself beyond capabilities.  I have a new stress, and that is $.  Disability only nets about 50% of what I had been able to earn.   Sad.  But we are working through it, making changes, and making it work.   Enduring the nerve pain, tingling, electricity, numbness, weakness and overall discomfort is what we do, 24/7.  It is down right miserable.   It sucks.  We try hard to not be as visibly miserable to others, as we want them not to suffer along with us.  We want them to want to be close to us.  We want to be able to do the things we loved.  So we find a way.   Being miserable and defeated does not invite many people to remain close.  We want to be happy.  For the most part we are.  We want to be \"normal\" again - like we were before.  That's not gonna happen.  I understand that, but I don't like it.  As none of us do.  The Internet has given us many avenues to obtain information, and very importantly the ability to find others who are enduring the same miserable symptoms as we do.  Wow... We are not alone!  We have others we can vent to who do \"get it\"!! I can't imagine how difficult this could have been for people 25 years ago.    I would love if we could somehow share our new found disabilities and physical feelings with our medical care givers, employers, insurance companies, our government, research grant holders, family, friends, etc., who truly don't understand how this type of nerve damage feels.  If we could share exactly what we are feeling with them, so they could have a true sense of how this affects us, then they would \"get it\".  Just share those physical feelings with them like a Vulcan \"mind meld\" for a short time.  Brilliant!!  In another forum, I read from a woman who did not have BC.  She is a victim of soft tissue sarcoma.  She has RIBP from her related radiation treatments, and found a thread to post for support.   Shows that radiation damage is not only affecting BC or Hodgkins Lymphoma survivors.  And it adds to the many of us who are looking for help.  Looking for answers.  Looking for changes for future treatments.  There must be some way the Brachial Plexus can be preserved throughout radiation treatments.  There must be some way to ensure our lives are ridden of the cancer, AND ensure the life saved, can survive with the highest quality possible.  The more collective voices we have, the louder we become.  The louder we become, the more opportunity to be heard. My Oncologist's PA talked with me the other day.  We discussed my issues and damage from the chemo and radiation.  She, recognizes the need for continued care of the survivor.  She told me that this need is finally escalating.  And that she would love to be a part of it.  Is that not the best news!!  Think about it, a clinic or Dr we could go to after the Oncologist turns us loose as a survivor.  Someone who understands a \"cold\" for us is different then all other patients coming into a primary care physician.  Someone who is extremely knowledgable of cancer survivor needs.  Incredible!  I believe we are making headway! I was asked to write a short story for the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Bridges magazine, regarding my visit to the Rehab Center for survivors in August 2011.  Here it is, in the Bridges - Spring 2012 edition.... Page 7, titled Surviving Survivorship.  :)  www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/surv... I hope everyone is doing well, and fighting the fight. Stay Strong, Cindy",

These drugs take some of the edge off of the constant stinging, but thats it. I still get a lot of breakthrough pain throughout the day and night. Sleep is disturbed with many occurrences.

      "Content": "Jan 5, 2011 10:41AM Cincerely wrote: Where do I start? Wow - it's been 5 years since I was diagnosed, and not quite 4 years since my treatments (chemo & radiation) completed. It's been just over 4 years since I started having neurological issues with my hands/feet from the chemo - tingling/numbness/clumsiness/stinging/pain. It has continued to worsen over the years, and about the last 8 months has grown more agonizing. I have gone through physical therapy, MRIs, CAT scans, EMG nerve conduction tests, massage therapy, and multiple doctor visits. Final result is that I have a RIBP [Radiation Induced Brachial Plexopathy] and CIPN [Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy]. Neither of which is reversible. The biggest culprit from the chemo drugs was vincristine (1984 for Hodgkins Disease) and more recently, taxotere (2006 Breast Cancer). The radiation I received for the breast cancer in 2006 overlapped areas where I had mass upper mantle radiation treatments for the Hodgkins Disease. The mass upper mantle radiation from the 80's is what caused the Breast Cancer 22 years later. The RIBP is so severe, my clavicle and shoulder areas feel to the touch, like cement was poured in. So solid, there is no soft tissue. The nerve damage is severe in the upper torso - shoulders/neck/back/arms/hands - additionally the damage extends into my toes/feet/ ankles/lower legs. The numbness/tingling/stinging/pain is cruel and relentless. Feels like bare electrical cords are running through my body parts, non-stop 24 hrs a day. The weakness from muscle loss is debilitating. I am to the point with the nerve damage where my right hand is basically like a rubber Halloween hand - flimsy, no strength in the fingers - no coordination - sensory feeling is mostly nonexistent, except severe pain from heat/cold and constant 100% of the time needles/pins. The muscle atrophy is very severe - muscle tone is gone - if I place my hands next to each other the right hand is about half the size in width as my left. Unless I actually look at my hand, I don't know if my fingers are bent, or straight. They always \u2018feel' like they are bent or curled under, even when they are not. I reach into something and often bend my little finger back or out to the side without even realizing it. Typing is a challenge - lots of backspacing and deleting - good thing spell check helps. My right forearm is relatively smaller in size to my left from muscle loss. The upper arm is stronger, but definitely weaker than the left. I am a right handed individual by birth - however, I have now changed my dominant functions such as eating, drinking, writing, number typing, keyboard typing, holding, carrying all to the left. My shoulders and neck sometimes feel so weak and painful I can barely hold my head up, and need to lie down till it rests enough to continue on. My left hand/arm/shoulder is also affected with the damage. And as I am finding, the more I rely on my left hand, the worse it too is becoming. Oddly, with this nerve damage, \"the more you use it, the more you lose it\" applies to muscle tissue. In the undamaged body world, the nerves feed the muscles. When the nerves are damaged, they can no longer feed the muscles enough to remain useful and strong. I am dropping a lot and having typing/mouse and strength/coordination issues, along with increased stinging pain in my left hand/fingers/arm than before. I now have a Physical Medicine Specialist MD who is at least understanding and informative. I have found over the past 4 years that the medical profession is basically unable to correct this type of damage. Oncologists and Radiologists brush it off. They can provide various drugs to mask the tingling symptoms and pain, but unable to stop the progression of nerve and muscle cell damage. I've tried a few types [Neurontin, Lyrica and some others I don't remember] with no benefit. Currently I'm trying Cymbalta low dose - I notice an ever so slight decrease in the sensitivity/pain to my right palm. But nothing dramatic. Sleeping is tough - I wake many times a night with discomfort and pain. Ambien helps me to actually fall asleep initially, and then get back to sleep after the multitude of wakening events - but not always -some nights are worse than others. I'm finding it more and more difficult to continue working - difficult physically and mentally. This frightens me, because I don't know how or if I qualify for social security disability. So I push through it the best I can, as we all do when life challenges us. Driving has been ok - I find it gets tiring the longer I drive from muscle strain in shoulders, hands and arms. Narcotics are not an option for me to help with pain. I am allergic to them - all of them - including Tylenol and Ibuprofen which cause nausea and dizziness - I have more side effects from all pain type meds then can be tolerated, even with anti-nausea drugs. The pain meds, and the anti-nausea drugs, also affect my nerves and I have tremors/shake, like I imagine someone would going through a mild detox event. They cause arms/legs to jump and twitch - and then add vomiting - makes it easier to deal with the pain, then the side effects from the pain meds. Chemo brain runs rampant - I would tend to believe 100% of chemo patients suffer from that. Oncologists forewarn us that the chemo drugs not only save our lives by zapping the cancer cells, but also damage the good cells needed for quality of life. As the patient, our decision to save our lives and survive is strong - worry about the other stuff later if it happens. The chemo I had in the 80's and 2006 included Adriamycin - helped kill those cancer cells, but resulted in Cardiomyopathy and Congestive Heart Failure. I have had more than the allotted dose of that type of drug for a lifetime. Chemo and radiation have saved my life twice - I am tremendously grateful for all the research and trials that have provided the level of knowledge, skill and testing that has been done thus far. I didn't write this posting to whine or complain - I post it to help others know they are not alone - and to be heard in the research world. If this one posting can help one other person, I am happy - if it can help the thousands of others who may need cancer treatments in the future, I'm ecstatic - I'd somehow find a way to do the Snoopy-nose-in-the-air-happy dance-all around the world! Sometimes it appears to me that we have so much focus on fighting and killing the cancer, that the quality of life for the patient is forgotten in the war. Even our options presented prior to treatments are hard to comprehend - we want to survive first - fear drives us to \"get it out\" with a big fight. Would I have made a different decision on treatment options? I don't know - hindsight is always 20/20 - but are we ever really given a clear picture about what our future may hold if we do the big fight? We should. I've done a lot of internet research and doctor/patient discussions to find most of the same answers - everyone responds differently to the chemo, ranging from some who have no noticeable nerve damage, to those who are incapacitated. Many of the internet search results are websites trying to sell various vitamins and supplements - nothing that I hold a lot of faith or trust in - just another way of taking advantage of the disadvantaged. There are websites that offer products to aide with performing day to day functions for those who have become one handed. They have some very helpful gadgets available. I have found this particular website beneficial - http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Radiation_Induced_Brachial_plexopathy.htm What I cannot seem to find are any kind of statistics on how many people are affected by the neurological side effects - based on what I've read posted by many, the numbers must be high. I keep reading some ridiculous percentage of 2% - really? Just from reading postings I know that number is way too low - How about all of those who don't post - How many more are the \"unheard\"? I believe that in numbers we may be able to get some attention. Attention and focus to help direct additional funding to not only kill cancer cells - but kill them without damaging the patient's quality of life. How many of us are really out there? Have there been any studies or clinical trials? There may be, and I just haven't been able to find them. Anyone out there know? Any other groups already established for those suffering from the neurological side effects caused by RIBP and CIPN? NOTE:  I've posted this same message under Chemotherapy - Before, During, and After - to try to reach out to as many sufferers of these side effects as possible. Cindy",

My veins were very uncooperative, and although they had 4 good sticks - i wasn't giving up enough blood for the lab work....  I usually have this problem, which again was due to the chemo scarring the veins - tough stick indeed!  Otherwise, I had a great check up - no additional scans as I had just had a cat scan in October that was clear.  I go back in 6 months for another followup and pet/cat scan. I also discussed the estrogen blocker (Aromasin) and how it may be adding to my chronic pain - I have 9 months to go to finish the full cycle - However, she said I could stop for a month or two and see if I feel better - If I don't feel any different, I can go back on and finish out the 9 months more.  I agreed to that line of thinking. So my dear friends/sisters - Let's keep up the good fight and communicate often! Take care -",

I will finish the 5 year cycle on this drug for my Breast Cancer. I asked her what she thought about acupuncture and it possibly helping with the stinging/burning pain - she was not sure, as she does not perform that. However, she has a colleague that is an MD and performs acupuncture. She said she'll reach out to her and get some feedback on whether she thinks it may help, or possibly hinder and cause the nerves more distress and irritability. Haven't gotten a response on that question as of this writing. I also said that since my symptoms are getting worse, I wasn't sure if the low-dose Cymbalta was still working. She said that the dosage can still be increased and be considered low-dose for nerve pain treatment as opposed to depression doses. But, she said to see if it is working at all, stop taking it for a week. Within a week's time I would be able to tell by the way I feel regarding pain. I stopped taking it on Saturday, and by Tuesday I could definitely tell it must have been helping to take the edge off of the pain and helped with the feeling of raw electrical wires running through my limbs... I also noticed increased sensitivity to noise causing me to feel like my insides were startled by anything remotely loud. I started back on the Cymbalta today - Thursday - in hopes it'll go back to taking that edge off of some of the symptoms. Good news to share - I will participate in two separate studies relating to RIBP - one with Dr Dorsey, at the Univ of Maryland. The other with Dr Radina, at the Miami Univ of Ohio. I am looking forward to helping those who have a desire to help us survive survivorship! Hope all of you are doing well - stay strong - survive survivorship! Cindy",

If I was made more aware of these issues, or rather, my Doctors been more aware, they could have taken the steps to ensure my brachial plexus was adequately protected during the 2006 radiation.  They were fully aware of my heavy dose mass given in the 80's, and knew there would be additional good cell damage with the Breast Cancer treatment.  I immediately pointed out the pain, numbness, solid like cement, symptoms I had at the beginning of my radiation treatments in '06 to the Radiology Dr.  However, she said she didn't know why that was happening.  And the radiation protocol remained the same for 33 sessions.  These are the things they should know, and need to know.... Treat the patient, not just the disease.  The more we speak out, the more we can help the medical field and researchers see the quality of life they just saved.  Believe me, when I say I am extremely impressed and happy that we have the technology and knowledge from research, education, clinical trials, and patient input, to have saved my life twice, is an understatement.  I am still kicking - not as good as I once was - but still kicking just the same because of it. My advice to you, and all others still in treatment phase, is to be aware of changes in your body, and speak to your Dr in detail.  Be sure she/he understands what you are feeling.... Not just physically, but emotionally. Bring up the concerns you have and don't give up until they provide adequate answers that put you at ease.  They are indeed the professionals, with way more knowledge than I have in my little finger.  Making them aware of what we feel physically and emotionally helps them help us.  Voice your concerns, gain as much knowledge as you can about your treatments, and be sure to fight the war against those nasty cancer cells with everything possible.  Your treatment plan is a decision only made by you and your doctor.  That is the most important thing there is now - focus on getting past this interruption of your life and getting well!!  Keep us posted on your progress.    Stay strong, Cindy    ",

I was lucky enough to stumble onto a great Dr who was able to recognize the symptoms and order the correct tests for my issues. Indeed I have multiple complications from the various treatments and exposures.... Having both RIBP & CIPN complicates things. The RIF could very well be what is affecting my neck, jaw (harder and harder to eat chewy foods), left arm, ribs. Right side is definitely the RIBP. I can feel the progression day to day in my right fingers, hand, arm, shoulder. Scary and sad. Legs, feet, left hand are all crazy with CIPN.... Dang it's hard figuring out what's going on where! Prior to the breast cancer they had tried to implant a port and could not get through the scar tissue from the Hodgkins radiation on my left upper chest... Had to go into my neck to catch the artery. Chest x-rays show a lot of scar tissue throughout, which tightens and limits the ability to take very deep breaths. I'm glad Dr Radina is going to be able to continue her study and gain useful and helpful details. I'll look forward to her study picking up again. Try and stay cool this summer!

They always give me printouts with detail pictures and instruction on each exercise. It's a good thing they do - chemo brain would never be able to remember it all! I had to by a binder with sheet protectors to keep all the exercises in. There are many posture correcting exercises I can do on my own, that help stretch and position my shoulders and neck. Most are very simple, yet very beneficial. Breathing from the diaphragm is helpful for core strength. Using the diaphragm allows deeper breaths and better posture. Remembering to sit and stand erect as if there is a string pulling my head straight up to the ceiling. Squeezing shoulder blades together while leaning against the outer corner of wall. Pushing each shoulder against a towel along the edge of a wall corner, while keeping my body straight. Multiple hand flex and finger coordination exercises, some using play-doh type putty.... I always liked play-doh! There are strength exercises to help maintain my upper arm muscles, as they are least affected by the nerve damage. These are more isometric, not using any weights. The weights dramatically increase my stinging paresthesia pain and what I call \"bee stings\" in fingers/hand. The PT manual manipulation is incredible... she is able to get down into the tissue, with very little pressure, but so exact in positioning that it has already helped loosen my bound shoulder from my neck. Amazing. She gets into my neck/head at just a couple points, and it makes a huge beneficial difference. Learning again how to use leg muscles that haven't been used properly in quite some time is a big challenge, and probably the most physically demanding. The entire plan will be brought home to continue. Suggestions on therapists at home were even provided, based on their completed levels of training and knowledge. Goals of feeling better and enhancing quality of life are being met. Learning to sleep on my back is still taking time to get used to - sleeping in a hotel bed isn't helping either - back sleeping is best because it opens your chest for better breathing, and helps keep the shoulders stretched out, much better for back health. Its important to use a flat head pillow, and be sure to place it above the shoulders, so it isn't pushing your shoulders forward. Placing pillows under the legs helps keep the natural curve of your back. Once you are in a comfortable position, there should not be much movement through the night. A long restful sleep - what a concept?! Sleeping on your side can cause the shoulders to fold inward, allowing them get into the position that only encourages them to want to stay that way - binding the scar tissue/fibrosis even tighter. Two more days of therapy and learning to go - then I head home to continue on this path of rehab and QOL goals. This has been incredible - thanks to the MSKCC rehab medical staff - thanks to my life partner - thanks to my supportive friends who came on this journey with me - thanks to the internet for providing so much knowledge at my fingertips, and connecting new friends for support and knowledge sharing..... let's see, who is that? Al Gore??? LOL More to come after I get home and have the results of my MRIs. Stay strong, Cindy",

I hope you were able to get some relief.  Let me give you a couple websites to explore.  My personal blog is http://survivingsurvivorship.blogspot.com/ I am working closely with http://www.myheartyourhands.org  in order to spread the word regarding all cancer survivors and late effect, side effects from chemo and rads.  These side effects are becoming more prevalient as we survivors are living longer. Here is a video link for an interview with Stephanie Zimmerman, Co-Founder of MyHeartYourHands.org, regarding their mission.  Additionally, it includes a sneak preview of the documentory she is producing. http://vimeo.com/73405731 I hope this helps you stay connected!  Keep fighting, my friends!",
