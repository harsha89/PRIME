      "Content": "MarcysMomma wrote: Hello! I have had right breast pain for 7 months. Family practitioner sent me for a mammo and sono. Both were normal. Still having pain so was referred to a breast specialist/oncologist. Tried her regime to help breast pain for 6 weeks and it did not improve so I got an MRI. The MRI results came back and the radiologist that read it thought it was an infection that there was lots of inflammation in my right breast. My breast Dr ruled infection out and said maybe yeast with a shrug agreed lots of inflammation. So I\u2019m starting a 2 week course of antifungals and a topical anti inflammatory. Anyways if it doesn\u2019t improve in 2 weeks she said I could wait for more symptoms to appear or things to show up on ultrasound or mammo or I can opt for a mri guided breast biopsy. I feel like she has no clue what it is. Maybe I need a second opinion? I\u2019m wondering if anyone has had similar results, and if getting two mris so close is safe Log in to post a reply",
