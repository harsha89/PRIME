My doc said breast conservation is the best way to go. They don't suspect lymph node involvement but are doing the Sentinel node biopsy anyway. I am scheduled to go in within a few weeks for surgery. I've had breast pain (large cysts that had to be drained) and greenish/yellow liquid easily expressed from my nipples for the last 11 years. Mammogram never found the cancer, MRI did. Ultrasound guided biopsy confirmed it. I am still in \"pain\" now... that is, I have a dull ache where the biopsy was done a month ago and it radiates to my underarm. Prior to biopsy i was having trouble with stiffness and sharp shooting pains through my neck on that side, right up to my chin. I am uncomfortable all of the time. Wondering if a mastectomy is a better option? ",
