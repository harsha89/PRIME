Post a mesage here \"anyone in Tampa, Florida?!\" and I would ask around my community.  I am fairly new to my location but was able to find a few woman that had finished treatment in the last couple of years. By the way, my cancer was caught on a routine mammogram, so I was immediately scheduled with that hospital breast oncology team.  I had my MRI, genetic tests etc. done and was looking for a 2nd opinion.  I brought all of the path reports from the original hospital (they actually transferred the records) and chose the 2nd opinion.  So, continue with your appts - and look for a 2nd.  You may end up staying at your original place.  I am sure in my case either would have been fine.

That said, I would think your cardiologist would have an opinion.  Lumpectomy is a pretty easy recovery, although still requiring general anestethia (how DO I spell that?).  I am not sure is a mastectomy will be a longer surgery, with a more difficult recovery or not.   You have a 2nd opinion on March 5th - the MRI results should give you more clarity with what you are dealing with.  I would make an appt. with both Cardiologist and Kidney doc (Nephrologist?) to see what impact either/both surgeries have on you - if any. Hopefully, someone who has been there, done that will see your questions and respond.  Meanwhile, go see your other docs - with all of us getting bc I would think they have dealt with this before.

I agree with the previous posters.  Your anger is misguided - you, of course can do what you want, but you are young with very young children.  Her2+ I believe will automatically up your oncotype score, which will probably put you into the \"must have chemo\" area.  THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT.   Chemo is not the end of the world.  It is very doable.  3 cm is on the larger side.  That does not mean that you are node positive.  I am 44, and node negative.  My sister (whom I trust) is in the medical field and she was ADAMENT that I do chemo, even with no node involvement.  My oncotype came back high intermediate, so I started chemo and really am doing well with it. I would suggest you do get a second opinion.  I have a feeling they will concure with your original oncologist. By the way, I have not read about the 1cm tumor size indicating cells in the blood stream, but I have read that negative nodes is not 100% guarantee.  There is no test for cancer cells in the blood stream - until it gets really advanced.  They use the lymph nodes as the guide and assume that if it is in the nodes, it is in the blood stream.  If it is not in the nodes, hopefully it isn't in the blood stream.  Another reason why I chose chemo. Karen, I am 44 and also so healthy it would make you shocked!  I feel great.  I have not been on the pill, and have none of the risk factors.  sh#& happens.  I feel lucky this was caught.

You have been in my thoughts.  This is your personal choice, as you know. I think chemo is much less scary than you write about.  I also think your best chance at no recurrence is to hit it hard the first time - especially as young and healthy as you are. I also did a ton of research, as I imagine most of us do.  For me knowledge is power. Keep healing, build up your strength, and keep learning about the specifics of your case.

They can mammogram, ultrasound or MRI but a biopsy is the real info. Good luck and let us know how it goes.",

I had two surgical consults - the first said she would absolutely refuse to do a mastectomy, and the surgeon I went with said it was completely overkill in my specific case, but would do as I wished. I think each case is very unique, but I also believe that one lumpectomy that needs better margins no longer = immediate mastectomy.  Your case (and mine) are good examples of that. Good for you -  and it sounds like your surgeon in Visalia is great too - interested in learning vs. ego issues. I don't know when your surgery at Stanford is scheduled, but good luck with it!",

I had an ultrasound once calcifications were found - are you having an ultrasound?  My calcifications were in a spiculated pattern - which, of course, was not a good sign - now I know that!

As far as your question, what happens next depends on your biopsy results.  It could be benign, in which case I don't know what they do.  If it is cancer, then the biopsy tells you exactly what type, hormone receptors and grade and then you make plans to have it surgically removed and Staged where they also check your lymph nodes. 1cm is small, and in my case my mass looked 2-3 cm on ultrasound and was actually 1.6cm. I would try to get a sooner appt, and if you can't, just try to remember that you have caught this now which is good, and will deal with it.

Poeticrevolver - your question is a good one.  Good that you tested negative for the BRAC gene - although we all know there are most likely other genetic markers that haven't been identified yet.  I, have a 13 year old daughter - and I had my first abnormal mammogram at 44 when diagnosed.  I will encourage my daughter to start checking in her early thirties at the latest.  I also agree that right now with your diagnosis I would not get your girls to over focus on what this means to each of them.  Like Isla wrote,  most women I know with BC have no family history - and that included me.  I made sure my daughter knew that I am the only woman in our family (of MANY women) to get BC so most likely it is not hereditary AND in my case early detection found it. I agree with much of what Collette wrote - vitamin D is a big issue for increase in cancer, breast cancer and other health issues (I too live in the Pacific NW).  I was deficient and my entire family now supplements.  We already did organic milk, meat and most of our veggies, so that didn't really help us out.  I also have avoided foods with corn syrup - and still do for the whole family. My sincere hope is that we will find a CURE for this in our lifetimes - and that will protect our kids. I think that we will find more tests like the oncotype, and BRAC to pinpoint and treat each of our cases as individually as possible.  My oncologist told me that breast cancer is really like 6-8 completely difference diseases. I'm sorry you went thru hell getting diagnosed, and hope that you are doing okay with your treatment plan.",

      "Content": "Jan 9, 2011 12:42PM - edited Jan 9, 2011 12:57PM by aprilgirl1 Wow - Kansakay you are coming across as very defensive.  Plenty of stage 1 women do not need chemo.  Plenty do.  Each of us have very individual cases - as much as the docs categorize us into stages and grades - as a scientist you would know that it is not nearly this simple. My oncotype was 23 - middle ground - so I happily did chemo.  44 at diagnosis, and with two young kids and as others have posted, would be much happier with the knowledge that I did chemo as the gray oncotype category is not known at this time if chemo really helps.  I really don't care. For me, I know I did all I could with the info. I had to decrease my risk of recurrence.  I feel GREAT.  LOOK GREAT!  Had no side effects at this point and don't expect to have any.  I did CMF which is very \"popular\" in my region.  It was very easy for me to tolerate. I was put into chemopause, and the pause stuck, so I am on femara with quarterly estrogen checks by my oncologist.  With femara I am lucky that I don't have any noticeable side effects and have been on it for a year now. Like most of the women on here, I have no family history, and my only risk factor was having my first child at 32.   My point is, Kay - I think we all support your decision.  For you this is what made sense.  The sense I get from  your posts on this thread is that you believe those of us who are stage I and did chemo \"drank the Koolaid\" because we are somehow less intelligent, or misinformed - or basing our decisions on FEAR not FACTS.  This could not be farther from the truth - I am very informed and very intelligent, as I believe most of us are.  I most often question authority, had multiple opinions and many doctors in my family that reviewed my case. The question was - \"If you were stage I, did you get chemo?????\" and you can see many of us did, and many of us didn't- as I said,and you know it would be wrong to not use the oncotype to help us to make our decisions. Hoping that all of you waiting for the oncotype get a low score!  ",

As she is not brac1/2 positive that supports a lumpectomy as well.  I chose a lumpectomy.  I also had a 4mm satellite of my original tumor (1.6cm).  They have a 1mm clear margin on the dcis, so I need a re-excision.  I am really happy, even with a re-excision that I had only the lumpectomy.  Frankly, I am less worried about recurrence in the breast and more worried about systemic recurrence.   I think we all need to support our own decisions.  Have you checked out Dr. Susan Love's website or book?  I think there is information on there to help make this decision. This is directed to Just Saying - My dcis was picked up on the ultrasound and MRI.  I have an acquaintance that has three small DCIS tumors picked up my mammogram, so I disagree that DCIS is not screenable BUT I will agree that I hear of cases often (of course on this site!) that were missed, or picked up after the fact and that completely freaks me out! I think if it makes sense, is easy to remove and you get clear margins, lumpectomy is the way to go.  No one can fault those who go for the mastectomies either - especially due to multiple tumors, close to chest wall, or too extensive.  Good luck with this! Either way, it will work out for you.",

Here is what I found out.  As long as you have continuous coverage, have not missed any cobra payments and start your new policy immediately the insurance company can not use pre-existing conditions against you.  I think they also have to give you a fair price for your policy. If you do not have continuous coverage, then they can deny insurance and also use pre-existing conditions against you.  So the important thing is to not let your coverage drop, or have missed payments. We stayed with Regence on an individual plan.  The cost was relatively the same, as well as what they cover.  They do provide you with a \"certificate\" or letter of coverage, which is very important.  We picked the most expensive Regence plan as they had the best prescription coverage.  Honestly I did not research too many other insurance companies as I found the whole process scary and overwhelming. Good luck with this!  This whole process has given me and my family a whole new understanding of the health care issues in the US.",

I did not have to fill out any of the medical forms - as I had that certificate of coverage.  Without it, I would have had tons of additional paperwork regarding medical history of my whole family. The one thing that is KEY is that you do not drop in coverage at all during Cobra.   Either way, Cobra and now our individual coverage is expensive.  As my husband was laid off right before my diagnosis, and has started his own company  it has been very stressful to say the least.  I did call my insurance company to inquire about individual plans after Cobra eneded about 6 months before our termination date just to find out what they would say aboutpre-existing conditions.  Call your insurance company (I did it without stating my name or policy number) and see what they say.  It gave me a lot of peace of mind.

As I tested negative, and after the Mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI only had the one tumor, I chose to do a lumpectomy.  My tumor was small and in a good place to surgically remove.  My doctors also recommended lumpectomy.   It is really a personal decision.  Mastectomies are often necessary, but in my case it wasn't and in my opinion, if you are do not test positive for the brac1/2 gene your case is pretty straight forward too. Best of luck to you - keep posting! ",

Due to your age, ask if it is a digital mammogram - that is important for younger women that typically have dense breasts.   GREAT that he scheduled an ultrasound - between the two tests you will be in good shape to get some answers.  Sending you prayers and positive thoughts.  ",

They can't predict the effectiveness of chemo based on tumor size, so I'm not sure what your are referring to when you said \"the Surgeon said the effectiveness of chemo at 2.5 is really on the fence\".Maybe the surgeon was referring to 2cm as the point of which they automatically recommend chemo? I think it's a great idea to get a second opinion but also get the oncotype test done.  They take a tissue sample from the tumor and send it to Genomic Health to have the test performed.  It's possible due to the total size of 5cm they won't do the oncotype, but that I don't know. My tumor was 1.6cm, and my oncotype score was 23.  I did chemo, and handled it fine - happy I did it and it's behind me. I'm happy for you that your surgery is behind you and once this decision is made, you will feel soo much better.  Good luck and hugs to you!",
