I am concerned as when I first ovulated after the surgery I still felt the tingle/sensation in the breast and some anxiety in the chest. I also found a small lump close to my right hip which has not been diagnosed any further. I would definetly correlate the PASH with ovulation. I will be making further Dr.'s appt.'s to investigate further as I feel the PASH will be right back :(  I do feel that the PASH is hormone related and that my hormones have not been right for quite some time. I have even looked into. Bioidentical hormones. I have some follow up appt.'s right now but may foot the bill to have my hormones checked out more extensively. Good luck to you and remember you are your own advocate keep up the research.",
