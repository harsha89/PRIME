    "Content": "LHebs wrote: Hello all, I was dx with IDC in Jan 2018 along with a positive lymph node on biopsy. I underwent 8 rounds of neo-adjuvant chemo of dose dense AC and dose dense Taxol.  The primary tumor was not detectable on US after chemo and the inflamed node was also unable to be seen on US. I had a bilateral mastectomy with direct to implant last week along with SNB. I had a complete pathological response at the primary tumor site in the breast but the SNB showed 2/3 nodes still had evidence of cancer on the pathology report. Trying to figure out the next step.  They are presenting my case to the tumor board on Friday to see what everyone recommends. Looks like it will be either 1) axillary dissection and radiation 2) just axillary dissection or 3) just radiation. Being that I am only 37 I want to be as aggressive as I can to prevent it spreading. Anyone with similar issue? What did your Dr's recommend? What did you decide? I knew this was a possibility but so crazy to have a cPR at the primary site but still evidence of disease in the node.
