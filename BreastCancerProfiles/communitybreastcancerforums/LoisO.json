The study started in 1997.  So far there have been no recurrences in the cases in the study.  Just the fact that it took 10 years to find 48 cases to enroll in the study shows you how rare Phyllodes is.  He said there are 500 cases a year in the U.S.  So if your doctor is not up to date on this disease, you may have to do some research and seek out a consult at a teaching hospital.",
