Hand wash in a small amount cheep baby shampoo (usually $1.00 at dollar general). Do not use regular detergent and especially not woolite as they break down the fibers. When they are thouroughly rinsed, place in an absorbant towel and wring to get majority of water out (do not wring without towel). Then lie flat to air dry. Once a week you can toss them in the drier on no heat or low heat when its almost dry(no heat for natural rubber garment, not the best garment by the way) the drier will help to retsain its shape better. NEVER wear a wet garment. This method will extend the life of your garment by 1-2 months. Juzo will normally last 5-6 months with daily use and daily wash, if you care for it properly, you should get 6-7 months or more out of it, depending how much you wear it. ..................Sigvaris are nice but they only last 4 months tops and most insurance companies only allow 2 per year. Jobst and medi are just ok, but they are durable garments. If you need an answer on any other equipment, just ask.....I know just about every product available. :)",
