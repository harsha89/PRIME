I was hoping for a dx, but I guess these things take much longer than I expected. I was told that I need to go in for an MRI and that they have scheduled an appointment with the breast surgeon for Tuesday. They need to do a surgical biopsy because of abnormal cell growth, atypical hyperplasia, and many changes from my last mammo in Feb. They want more of a tissue sample in order to know how to proceed. They did say that even though they are not calling it cancer right now that just with what they have I would be at a very high risk right now. Given all this information I almost feel as though I just want it out of my body even if it is this Atypical hyperplasia thing. Will I be given any kind of options if that is what it is? I am 37 and have two beautiful children at home that I need to be around for, for along time. I plan on seeing my grandchildren someday and don't want to wait for this to turn into something more. Maybe it is more and I just don't know that yet. Please let me know if anyone has been given options with these types of things. Thanks!!! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "turnberry wrote: Hi Ladies, Don't know what happened to my last post??  Computer ate it I think. I have a question that I'd like to just throw out there to see if anyone has insight to this.  I have ADH and last year they had suggested I go on Tamoxifen.  I chose not to because my maternal grandmother had a history of blood clots.  Another reason I chose not to was because every single procedure I've had done in regards to my breasts (cyst aspirations, stereotactic biopsy & surgical biopsy) I've developed hematomas.  Now maybe it's just in my mind that blood clots and hematomas are related but does anyone have factual information regarding this.  I go in next week for my 6 mo. follow-up mammo and see the surgeon the next week and I think Tamoxifen might be brought up again at some point.  I just want to know what the risk is.

Went to the doctor - she didn't seem all that concerned and thought it was just changes with age (Fibrocystic). It seemed to grow over the last couple of monthes so I called to schedule a mammogram. I did have tenderness in the area where the lump was and still is. Had the Mammogram done as well as u/s and they found a large cyst, some small ones and calcifications. Usually cysts can be painful, I'm wondering if maybe its near your sternum which might be cause for the pain. I don't know if that helps at all. Mammorgrams don't show the actual cysts, that is the reason they do the u/s. They usually just show up on the Mammogram as dense areas. Good luck.",

Is that possible while you are healing?  How does that feel?  I would not worry about it so much, but I am a receptionist and very visible to our waiting area and some people at work know that I am going through this and it might be awkward having them looking at my chest.  Thanks!!
