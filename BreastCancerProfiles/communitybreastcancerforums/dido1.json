The discussions have been really helpful, but I thought I'd post my particular circumstances and get some advice as to what to ask in the way of testing I am 38, nearly 39, years old. Cancer, but not breast cancer, runs in my family. I have been experiencing yellowish discharge, mostly when my nipples are brushed against bra, etc, for several months. This month my breasts are more swollen and painful than normal during my cycle, and yesterday I noticed a bit of bloody discharge. So I went to the walk-in medical clinic, where the doctor gave me a scrip for a mammogram. Neither he nor I could feel any lumps on examination. I understand that this is most likely a symptom of an intraductal papilloma, but I want to know what tests I should ask for to ensure that or something more serious doesn't get missed. It seems from my reading that mammograms and ultrasounds often miss things. Has anyone had a similar experience? Your advice would be most appreciated, as I am quite stressed out and want to write down what to ask my doctor for when I go see him (not that the clinic doctor wasn't nice, I just want to be thorough and involve my own doctor).
