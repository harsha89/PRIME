They did tell me no surgery & no radiation, unless sometime down the line after treatments they want to do something with the underarm bit ...but happy they think the arm should improve after the mass shrinks. Update 9/29: Chemo needed after all. Came back HER2+, so it's agressive after all....not happy about it, but if it lets me live a few years, so be it! ",

Since I'm stage IV w/bone mets (thank God brain, liver & lungs are good) and HER2+ she said they were going to bombard me....oh goodie. Hope it works! No surgery, Lynn Cancer said they rarely do surgery on stage 4's anymore....they even said they don't really grade them they way they used to, but if I had to have a reference number, it was a 4. On my new road & hoping for the best! You are younger & staged less, so I hope you have a fabulous recovery!!!! Keep me posted on how you are, and how the first chemo goes.....have to go check on the wig I ordered today; got the adorable beanie, so I'm all set!",

      "Content": "Longtail wrote: My tale begins July 3, when my husband died. I had been his 24/7 caregiver for four years, plus working. He wanted to go, & finally did. Afterwards, I noticed my left arm swelling a little, like lymphedema, & I thought it was from trying to lift him all the time...i.e. pulled muscle under my armpit. Jump to this week, after many scans, etc, (ps: my mammogram was FINE - they said come back in a year!) I was told that my 1st ever diagnosis is Stage 4, Metastatic IDC, HER2+, ER+ & PR+. Seems my upper spine lit up a little on the Pet scan. This week I'm scheduled for a brain scan (they don't think it's there), bone biopsy (it's there) and the chemo port is on Oct. 4th. So in July my health was fine, and now I feel almost like a death sentence has been handed to me. They (the well-known women's cancer center) are surprised that I have no symptoms, other than my swollen arm, which isn't too bad. I'm extremely healthy, in good shape, eat well, take no meds, look great and feel great. Even now, other than tightness in my arm, I'm fine. This is such a sad shock to me; I was looking forward to starting a new chapter near my son & maybe retiring. I'm alternate between weepy & determined. The 'Team' tells me that even though this is not curable, it is treatable. I could have ten years or more, if I'm lucky. After chemo, my treatment will be Herceptin/Perjeta, which is supposed to halt the growth and a fairly new cocktail...nicknamed 'Cleopatra' by the FDA. They said to think of the 3 masses they found (one pressing on lymph node in armpit - hence swelling - as 'snowballs'....with this new treatment, it will turn into 'snowflakes'.....the cancer will be in me forever, but it is treatable, and if/when flare-ups come, they will adjust whatever meds I'm on then. Gives me hope, but the chemo stuff terrifies me, even though I know zillions of women have gone through it. I am a 'young' 70 & was so looking forward to the next 20 years! Hope I still have that. Hopefully this forum will encourage me....I'm looking for survivors of S4 & their stories. Docs said the good news is that it's hormone based positive, which is much easier to treat than negative. Silver linings?? Thank you....! Log in to post a reply",

Diagnosed 9/15 with stage 4, triple +, in bone but not liver, lungs or brain. Yay! Port goes in on 4th, chemo starts on 9th. They said they are going to bombard me since this is agressive (HER2+). Moving to be with my son & his family in early November, for the duration of the chemo treatments, and then hopefully my own place again. Got a cute beanie hat & ordered a wig but haven't gotten it yet. Doc said I'd lose the hair about 17 days after chemo #1. Let me know how you feel after the first one! It will be a busy month with all the usual moving crud - address changes, etc - I'm hoping I have the energy for it. I didn't have surgery as the cancer center said they don't do surgery anymore on Stage 4's, just treatments. If it hadn't been for the HER2+ I wouldn't need chemo, either...that was another shock. I feel great, have no symptoms at all, and my mammo was fine....go figure!!! You hang in there, too!",
