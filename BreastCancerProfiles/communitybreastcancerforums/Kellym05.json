I actually squeezed it and a little something came out. The following week or so it seemed to be going away. However it hasn't, it is just a small red dot now. It hasn't gotten any bigger or smaller. As far as i can tell there aren't any lumps. Wondering if anyone else has experienced this. Thank you in advance Log in to post a reply",
