The Breast Health Center was called back today (06/14/2011) for spot compression and breastultrasound. It seems silly to wait and stress for so long over a test that can be done easily. I am a worrier. I am very nervous now, and I cannot wait for 10 days to go back for spot compression and  breast ultrasound. Here's my Mammogram Findings.....\"There is a focal asymmetry measuring 10 millimeters in the left breast at 3 o'clock at a middle depth.\" and \"In the right breast, no suspicious masses, calcifications or areas of unexplained architectural distortion.\" I have no idea or any knowledge about terminology for \"Digital Screening Mammogram\", \"focal asymmetry\" and \"breast cancer\". Is it normal to be called back for additional films, especially after a first screening mammogram when there are no films for comparison?  What's the chance for the focal asymmetry measuring 10 millimeters in my left breast at 3 o'clock at a middle depth turn out to be a cancer?
