Please don't everyone go thinking this will happen to you.  This is because she only has one lung - and as the beast weakens everything, it weakened her more than those of us with two lungs.   I'm putting this here so no newbies come along and think this is their fate - it isn't.  My Dad is resting, but he's a mushy soul and spends a lot of his time with my Mother - which is beautiful. Please keep praying - she is far from the stage of out of the woods yet, but I feel your prayers are helping.  I have to belive in something at the moment. Zeana xox  ",

She did as she said she would and took the Xeloda with the attitude \"I will die trying to fight\", and at 77 y/o what she did was very brave. Having said that, my Mother is rather naughty - she was given some prednisone for her lung [she only has one] as she couldn't breathe without it.  She says its asthma, my Dad says its from radiation - we daughters fear it is the Beast.  The medical profession say nothing - as far as I know my Mother has requested not to know. She won't come off the prednisone, and her original 10mg a day has been increased by her to 20mg a day in 2 weeks.  This concerns me as regards what the actual steroids could do to her - and yet on the other hand without them she can barely breathe.   I know most of my Mothers treatment is palliative, I don't know if steroids are now. Do any of you know about this doseage used longterm?   I just tend to feel if she can go from 10-20mg so fast, how long before she goes to 30mg, and yet I don't want her to suffer. This is all so confusing and frightening at the same time.   Mum is ER+PR+HER DX 1989 IDC Stage 0 ::: Stage IV mets to lung Dx 1999 - 2010 mets to bone and liver:2011 - Liver Failing - End Stage Care Only: My beautiful mother passed away 8/15/2011 Dx 5/15/2010, IDC, <1cm, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I'm grateful for the info you have shared because at 77, I don't think I need worry about the steroids for my Mother.  In many ways I want her comfortable at all costs.   She has said she no longer cares about the cancer; just quality of life - but I did personally fear the steroids could take that QOL away. Thank you so much.  I am praying that Xeloda has zapped the beast from her liver. Please take care of yourself - I read your posts a lot. :)   Hugs, Zeana",

My Mother passed away a week ago under palliative sedation after her extremely long battle with this beast. I also want to tell each of you something - my Mother was in stage IV for over 11 years and apart from a few weeks of Xeloda and Femara she had no chemo - she didn't want it.  Instead she chose a natural path for many years and deep in my heart I believe it served her far better than the en masse chemicals.  I didn't always think this way - I used to feel quite angry that she had never had the \"big chemo\" - but she had life on her terms and that's the way it is.  That path is not for everyone - but it was her way. The saddest part was the removal of her lung without a biopsy.  It made her suffering intensely worse than anyone with 2 lungs [we were told this at the end], and I know she would have wanted me to tell anyone not to have your lungs surgically touched until they have done a biopsy if at all possible. But 11+ years was a long time, so if anything - never, ever give up hope.  Choose your own path and live by it.  I certainly will if I get BC. I miss my Mom so much - everything is so unreal - I can't accept she is gone, but in her passing I learnt so much. No one is too old, too young, too anything to die of this beast I hate and loathe with my very being.  Hearing my two year old nephew sob hysterically over the loss of his Nanna was equal to the loss of any child for a Mother.  Age is no barrier to loss.  Children die of this wretched disease in other forms - this animal called Cancer knows no bounds and part of me refuses to believe that medical science cannot do more than it is. My Mother told us to to be happy - she was so beautiful inside and out - I cannot find that part called 'happy' as yet - only wretched waves of tears and denial and an emptiness no one can fill. Thank you.  Thank you.  You all helped me so much and if I had a magic wand I would wash and rid this planet of this beast. Please never give up hope!!!

Her color is greyish and oxygen levels were way down.  I feel so scared - scared for her - scared for my Father who had chest pains yesterday - scared for my sisters.  It's like all there is is fear.  We thought she had come to a place of moderate QOL given her situation, but it's all gone just like that. Scared is not really the word - its more like a terror that keeps happening and I see no sense in why such lovely women get this d*amn awful disease.  I hate it.  Loathe it.  I feel like my faith is going down the drain and that we are all experiements in a petri dish --- I'm so sorry, just ranting and sounding stupid and not caring anymore and no one knows the hell of how do you help a woman who has one lung because doctors removed the other one by mistake????  No one need reply.  I'm just letting it out where I feel safe because there really IS nowhere else.  I said to my husband that if my Mother passes from cardiac, they will say she was a BC survivor they cured.   What a joke - but that happens as you all know.

There is one person who deserves a mention in all this - that's My Hero Daddy Boy close on 80 who personally was my Mother's caregiver, husband, nurse, lover, and just everything rolled into one person I am so proud to call My Father.  Many men far younger than he struggle with what he did, and all after a heart attack, heart surgery and a stroke.  He stayed that distance, and it was so beautiful it hurts.  I have to say the greatest thing a man can do for his children is love their Mother - in sickness and in health.   Love is a verb and my Father proved it.   Now he has five daughters to watch out for him - and we do, and he still manages to give us his love even though his world is totally shattered.  He's the best!!!! My heart goes out to each of you who struggle with this beast - but I still say what I said to my Mother 'Where there is life there is hope', and there was for quite a time. For those of you who have lost a parent - yes, you know how it feels on this side of things, and I have so much empathy for each of you - it is a rough road to walk, but what choice do we have but the hope of one day seeing our loving parent/s again. I send warm healing hugs to all of you - none of you are ever forgotten by me so you may have to put up with me!!! With love and hope, Zeana",

The post she made to me was also sent to me privately, and I just thought \"she doth protesteth too much\".  She doesn't get it at all! My Mom is still around and has sweetly apologized to all of we daughters that she cannot support us in our grief.  That's her humor :) Hugs back at you!!! Payton - what I disliked so much was the lack of faces on the images.  As far as I know we all have a face - it just really got to me, and normally I post very little there. Good for you at getting rid of your pink cart - I do dislike the pink.  It's so scewed in its message - never representing the full picture. Thank you for the welcome back.  I acted out of emotions - I should have just shut up and taken a break. :)  Hugs to you!! Apple -  LOL.  Well, that's modern art. *splutter* :=)) Fitz, it was more than the pink I found offensive - it was the facelessness of the victims.  I find them a misrepresentation of fact. Cathy, Very true - but I don't think those paintings will fetch enough to make another herceptin - Revlon is a multi-billion $ affair, but I accept your point, too. Medigal, you are seeing what I saw and reacted to!  We all feel like that on certain days, but we still have faces and are not slimy pink things.  I sure as h*ll don't see my Mom in that light - not even at her worst times. Everyone here is still a woman with a body and a face and how she made women with BC appear repulsed me. Ugh! Peggy, thanks for the welcome back :)  I did get mad at that woman.  I sensed she wanted to make a name for herself from BC.  I relate to what your Mother did for BC and have donated works of my own to the cause - but they were women who looked like women - not like - well, read Medigal's post - she said it better than me!  Jeanne, yes, you \"got it\" too.  The artist has NO concept of this disease either from the point of view of the victim or as someone who is going to lose a loved one to this disease. I do not feel you are speaking just for yourself - how can any woman accept what happens to them with BC on a physical level?  The emotional and physical are synonymous. Medigal, the ones I donated to causes were of normal tasteful partial nudes - no more than a back showing or something, but always with a beauty that NO disease takes away.  Women are women and not something out of a jello box. Ugh. Shan, thank you so much.  My Mom is hanging in here at the moment!  I am feeling not so bad seeing that many of you felt as I did, or similar.  I was polite to her on forum, but it isn't what I felt.  Sometimes the freedom some artists take to express themselves knows no moral boundaries - and hers come under that category for me.  I hope she does cough up the donation $'s as well. Karma, Exactly - she's missing the whole point.  I can't believe she wrote that she had family members who had had BC - yet still she cannot \"get it\".  It makes me wonder where her feelings of humantity are. Dream - I agree with you entirely.  The general artist who has been at the game for a few years donates the \"original\" to an organization - he/she herself get no money first, and doesn't want it. Lowrider, that is how I sense it - it's a way for her to sell her art and not a heartfelt expression of humanity.  I could be wrong, but why not donate the paintings?  That seems a more honest way to me. I detest the facelessness.  That part gets to me probably more than the pink. lago, I already thought that :=)) Apple - the positive comments are the general style of comments no matter what a work is like - most good artists don't post work up there in the manner she did - she wanted attention, and she got it. MHP, I know - but that's the way some artists are headed - sadly IMO. lago, thank you so much, but I have much improvements to make myself.:) Lisa, thank you.  My mothers were taken with a cell phone camera, but I wish my sister had photographed them better.  Both my Mom and I make art from the heart - not out of any other reason.  I cannot relate the other woman's art to BC - and when I saw she related the faceless creatures to BC - I did see red! :) mrsnjband, I think we as women find breast cancer an ugly disease because it threatens not only our lives but at first our very femininity which is part of a woman's identity.  Whether it is a realistic issue or an emotional issue is not important - because people with humanity still see women as women regardless of BC. Well, that's my take on it - and I could well be wrong. _______________ Huge Hugs and Prayers to all of you ~Zeana xoxox ",

They are also treatable and need far lower doses than younger women! I get so mad at how docs want to give up on aged women who want to fight - I get really annoyed over this.  They have NO right to deny a woman who wishes to fight a right to life.  My Mother has said she will die trying to beat it.  She scares me, but now I admire and love her spirit.  I have to believe some good will come about for both our Mom's.  We know it won't be forever, but it isn't for any living person with or without BC.  I just want them both to have some QOL - just so they smile again..........  you know what I mean. Fighting daughters are good daughters.. :)  We love our Mom's, and they know it, so keep being a 'pest'......it's kind of called love. Zeana  ",
