    "Content": "Taralynn8869 wrote: Confused. ..on a comparison mammogram from last year where something was seen. ( a swollen lump and something else) but all further testing was postponed when my doctor broke both his feet and his fingers and became so high on pain meds I no longer felt comfortable with him treating me . he led me to believe it wasn't a big deal since no test were actually ordered after the breast ultrasound following the mammogram that showed cyst on the left breast in a cluster and a swollen lymph in the right which I never recieved results for, but no news is good news right. So why look for the worse like he said from the beginning. A year later on a comparison mammogram,( new doctor) I recieved a call back in and was told they saw subareolar focal asymmetry. And something about inversion nipple on right breast.. My doctor said she takes this very seriously, and said she wouldnt even waste the time ordering more test she was sending me straight to a breast surgeon 2 hours away...( I also had complete labs and all was good except I'm vitamin d defecient. My cbc would be off if something was wrong, right? )The surgeon called today to make the apt for 2 weeks from now... So I had a mini break down at the word surgeon and her reaction. Then I pulled my big girl panties up and said I'm not dealing with this today. I'm not driving myself crazy for 2 weeks.. Idk if I shoud be concerned or not.. I sat my oldest daughter and best friend down to tell them but what am I telling them?? Idk whats going on. Any help?? Should I be go concerned. Or is this something I can handle on my own without worrying family... Log in to post a reply",
