Due to me being 39 and my mom also having breast cancer at 44 (over 20 yrs survivor..yay!!!), I decided to do a nipple sparing bilateral mastectomy on Oct 21, 2016 (last Friday) at UTSW in Dallas. I also had a SNB and my nodes tested negative for cancer. Got good news from pathology report yesterday. There was not any more invasive cancer found, only additional clusters of DCIS found, nothing abnormal found in other breast I ended up staying in hospital for 2 nights, mainly because I was fighting naseau. Finally got under control, so was able to leave. Was doing okay a couple days at home, then all of a sudden nausea hit again. They just switched me from norco to tramodol today, so hoping that helps. Has anyone else experienced nausea this far away from surgery. Also, I was expecting a steady rise in how I feel each day, but it seems up and down. Is anyone else experiencing this? Thank you! ",
