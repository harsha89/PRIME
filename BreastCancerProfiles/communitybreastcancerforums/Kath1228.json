The core needle biopsy wouldn't have removed the entire lymph node - probably just a few very tiny tissue samples. It is most likely just some residual swelling from the procedure itself. I had a core needle lymph node biopsy recently with no lasting issues - even though I have had 3 lymph nodes removed in the past",

I couldn't tolerate tamoxifen so I am now on Letrozole. If you do not do hormonal therapy, I was told the recurrence risk about doubles to 14%. Too high a percentage risk for me personally. But everyone is different when it comes to risk tolerance. There are no studies I am aware of on taking it for fewer years or at lower doses. What doctors prescribe is \"standard of care\" because it has been studied Best of luck to you in this journey we are all on.",

I got one period after diagnosis so was still pre-menopausal. I did 14 monthly shots of Lupron to shut down my ovaries along with the Letrozole until my doctor figured I should be in menopause. So we stopped the lupron shots and left me on just the letrozole and she checked my estradiol levels every couple of months for a while until she was sure I was in menopause. Never had a period again after the first one after diagnosis. I guess the lupron and the shock of diagnosis threw me into menopause. That and the fact I was jut about 50 years old made menopause pretty likely! So only on the letrozole now.... It sounds to me like you would be a candidate for an AI - especially if you cannot tolerate the tamoxifen. Yourdoctor should check your estradiol levels and then go from there. Definitely discuss it.....",

That said, I still walk 3-4 miles 5 days a week ( if not more) and play golf 5-6 days a week. I do have pain but I push through it. It helps to keep moving. I take two Tylenol a day to help with the pain. I also do massage and acupuncture every three weeks and that helps a bit. But nothing really makes it go away altogether - I just deal with it. It helps to know that doing this this gives me the best chance to not have to revisit this disease ever againüôèüôèüôè  ",

Both came back as just reactive lymph nodes - thank goodness!! Very often that's what enlarged lymph nodes are - the way to tell for sure is biopsy or removal. I hope your results are the same!! Just be prepared - quite often they can't tell anything definitive from a FNA. Sometimes they don't get enough cells in the fluid that is aspirated. Very often it is just blood. So, They may need to do a core needle biopsy or removal of the node to be absolutely sure. This seems to be the normal course (I can't say I understand why) - a little scary to have to go through two procedures to get a definitive answer to say the least. That happened in both instances for me. So don't panic if that is what happens in your case.",

More than likely they are nothing - but I've since connected some stabbing pains I was having to possibly being related to my diagnosis. Again, yours may be nothing - but best to get it checked. Peace of mind is important. Also, please insist on an ultrasound in addition to mammography - mine was not seen on mammography due to very dense tissue. I went religiously every year for mammo and ultrasound and mine still wasn't found until it was 2.1cm. Not trying to scare anyone at all just passing along my experience in the hopes it can help someone.",

Perhaps something akin to needing to have have an x-ray or an ultrasound first before an MRI gets authorized. But I'm really not sure about that, so it might be worth asking. Again, doesn't make much sense. Both times for me, the second procedures were a week or two after the first. They need to get the pathology results back from the FNA first - that took about 5-7 days for mine. Again, hopefully just a reactive node due to shingles and/or Lyme. ",
