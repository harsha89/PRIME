She is 48 years old. She has Mets to her brain, bones, and lung. She also has a pleural effusion. She started off doing hormonal therapy with ribociclib/letrozole until the ribociclib gave her a terrible rash. She took about 3 weeks off treatment to get the rash to clear up then she started up with ibrance and continued taking letrozole along with radiation to her brain for the brain Mets. Once she completed her radiation, she somehow weened off the steroids too quickly which resulted in major confusion and episodes of her repeating stuff she saw and/or heard on tv which we later found out were a type of seizures. The neurologist we saw told her no more driving due to medications and her mental state (which has since improved drastically) My dad is a small business owner and works mon-sat 8:30-6 and I work roughly 40 hours a week. This resulted in me having to coordinate all her appointments for my days off which definitely takes a toll on me. She is getting her pleural effusion drained roughly every 3-4 weeks. An updated pet scan in April showed that all the other spots have gotten smaller but the pleural effusion keeps coming back and she had new small spots in her liver so her doctor decided to have her get a port put in and she now gets treated with abraxane. Tumor markers keep going down which is great. Still not driving. My main concern is that she is so so weak. Spend most of the day laying on the couch watching tv. The pleural effusion seems to be coming back slower than usual which is promising. But she is just so weak and her legs ache. When our 12 pound dog lays on them it hurts her. Has anyone experienced this? And do things get easier? I'm hoping that by my summary of the past 8 months gives a good idea about how hard it's been but also i think treatment seems to be working. Her spirits are high which is great. I don't really know what I'm getting at with this post. Maybe just needed to let it all out haha. Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. This board really helps ease my mind. Log in to post a reply",

I am 23 years old and I do have a younger brother who is 17 (doesn't drive due to bad grades but we are working on that). We actually got CT scan results today and it seems the spots in her liver aren't being contained by the current chemo so that's not the best news but I'm hoping the next will help. I feel like I made the situation seem worse than it is as far as me taking her, but all of your recommendations are great. I have arranged so that all her appointments are on Mondays and it's almost part of my routine now so i guess you can say I'm used to it. My dad handles all mom stuff on the weekends mostly so I am able to enjoy myself which is helpful. We have also started to grab lunch when we have some extra cash and I do like that we are able to spend time together, even if it is during a chemo infusion. But I will definitely keep all those recommendations in mind. I just pray so hard every night that my mother will still be around to experience life. Like my wedding, my future children, etc.. her and I are so close so this has just been so hard. Whenever I get sad about the possibility of losing her, she tends to yell at me and tell me to smile because she isn't going anywhere which always puts a smile on my face because I know she's fighting so hard. I have been encouraging her to get active on this forum as I think she would benefit from chatting with people who are going through the same thing so keep a look out for her lol",
