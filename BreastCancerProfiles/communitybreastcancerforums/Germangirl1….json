Today I had preliminary work like body mold made that I'll lie on for rads, and chest tatoos. First rads will be next Tuesday. RO prescribes a cortisone cream to be applies 2-3 times a day, said it has really helped prevent skin issues, and can still use eucerin and aquaphor. I did so well during my weekly chemo, hoping I do as well during rads. It does feel good to be moving forward to this next phase of treatment.   ",

Am having 2 tomorrow 6 hours apart, then singles rest of week, so I can be finished on Friday. Whole breast radiation went really well, no burns, and only minor rash in small area. I think mometasone cream RO prescribes really helped. Hoping boosts go just as well. Will check in later, everyone have a great week. Warm temps all week here in Ohio!",
