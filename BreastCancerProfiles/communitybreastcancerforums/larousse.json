There are many here who have been in your shoes and will be able to help you. You can only take on this thing one step at a time once you are over the initial shock. Were there any details in the biospy results? that may help the people here to give you more info on what is the standard treatment. Surgery asap sounds good. The sooner you know exactly what stage it is, the sooner you will be able to start the appropriate treatment. Keep posting, you will get a lot of support in this place. Best of luck.",

Although most recurrence are in the same location as the original area, there is a high enough % of recurrence that are somewhere else in the breast. I would do a lot of research on this, before making that choice. The biggest advantage is time, but in the long run, 6 weeks goes by rather quickly, and you don't get to be in a study. I wanted to know the stats of the treatment. The onc who was promoting this had some vague positive statement without real numbers, you may have better numbers than me. There are some on this site who did it and may come along to give their opinions and describe SE. Good luck in making your decision.

I have talked with quiet a few women, including on these, who have gone through this and moved on with their lives. He also told me about a woman with low grade, who decided not to do the rads, well it came back, invasive after 4 years. You are on the right path, hang in there, visit the April radiation thread, you can share your concerns, problems, etc. This is a great support system, and you will be done soon and move on, like so many. You should ask your doc for some anti-anxiety for night time, it helps me when I am getting all angst up.",
