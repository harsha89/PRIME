I have a PhD and am a nurse practitioner, I understand they may give me radiation to the lymph site only as I have had a double mastectomy prior to chemo. I became very ill post surgery with Pseudomonus which is the second worst infection obtained in the hospital second only to MRSA. I was more ill from the infection then the surgery or chemo. I have been very weak in bed for over five months, lost 62 pounds and now look like I did @ 12 years old. I am 63 and was very strong, very athletic, with waist length hair. They were very worried about me, and the Doctor span me around and danced with me he was so happy I made it this far. You need to remember one day at a time and everyone is new at this when it is you.What matters is you are loved.",
