I was in enough pain to have some difficulty. Ice/naproxen/hydrocodone/flexeril got me through thse first difficult days back. I now have to belt my work smock to keep the weight of it off my chest. I would recommend 6 weeks if possible.",

Getting up out of bed would be extremely painful right now and the handle on our lazyboy is just to much for me to move You can rent or buy one. Highly recommend",
