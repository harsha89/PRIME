Her Surgeon is in the same building so we decided we would go to see him so he could check on her drains.  They are getting a little red and I can tell the skin around them is irritated. I don't know if I shared with you ladies but my Mom and I refer to her surgeon as Dr. Cutie.  He is handsome and is one of the kindest Dr.'s we have ever met.  If he could be her oncologist we would be estatic!   When we got to Dr. Cutie's office, he looked at the drains and said everything looked good but the skin did seem to be irritated.  He asked her if she felt she could tolerate them as they are still draining to much to remove.  She said she could as long as she knows there is not infection.  He assured her there was not. THEN, Dr. Cutie looked in the computer and asked if there was anything else we needed to talk about.  I mentioned to him my Mom had recently got a CT and MRI and we were expecting to get the results next week from the oncologist.  He said, lets look to see if there are any results posted.  THERE WERE!  Dr. Cutie was happy to inform us that my Mom's CT and MRI came back clear!  Finally some good news!
