The onc nurse called to say she was relaying a message from my onc (who has been out with surgery and who is now coming to the office to do paperwork, but is not seeing patients, yet). Here is the message concerning my scans: * fluid around lungs is less * there is no fluid around the heart * there is less activity in the bone * there are new spots in the lung, but are too small to measure. We will keep an eye on them. She relayed that my onc said that if the last bit of news made me nervous, he would call me. It makes me nervous, so I expect a call from him today or tomorrow. I assume the treatment will stay the same, but I will wait to see what he has to say when he calls. I have other questions that I forgot to ask the nurse - such as have the lymph glands decreased in size, etc. The wait is over. The verdict is in. I am happy for the most part, yet a bit concerned. I will just put it in God's hands. Log in to post a reply",

The onc nurse called to say she was relaying a message from my onc (who has been out with surgery and who is now coming to the office to do paperwork, but is not seeing patients, yet). Here is the message concerning my scans: * fluid around lungs is less * there is no fluid around the heart * there is less activity in the bone * there are new spots in the lung, but are too small to measure. We will keep an eye on them. She relayed that my onc said that if the last bit of news made me nervous, he would call me. It makes me nervous, so I expect a call from him today or tomorrow. I assume the treatment will stay the same, but I will wait to see what he has to say when he calls. I have other questions that I forgot to ask the nurse - such as have the lymph glands decreased in size, etc. The wait is over. The verdict is in. I am happy for the most part, yet a bit concerned. I will just put it in God's hands. Log in to post a reply",

I am sorry I missed your question the other day, but here is my answer to your questions about avastin. I have had six TXs of Avastin three weeks apart. It is a fairly easy tx compared to many. It causes membranes to dry out, so nose bleeds, bleeding gums and bowel bleeding are common. It also can cause your blood pressure to increase. I am on BP meds, and while it does get higher for the first week after tx, it hasn't caused any problems and returns to normal the second week after tx. I am also on Abraxane, so I think my other SEs are related to it. I sure hope this helps - and I hope you hang in there with us. After all - we are in this together!

Take a benedryl before you get the shot (or right when you get home - remember they can make your sleepy). Remember, too, the first couple of shots are usually the worse and the SEs will settle down (a bit) as time goes on.  Hang in there! Oh, and a good rule of thumb is, if the pain persists for more than two weeks, have it checked out.  Better to error on the side of caution.",

On one thread a while ago someone explained that the reason your eyelashes fall out more than one time has to do with the life cycle of the eyelash. Under normal circumstances our eyelashes fall out at different times and then regrow and but the others mask that they are gone. When we lose our lashes all at once, all the lashes are on the same cycle for awhile, so all drop at the same time. It may take a few cycles to get them to not all drop at the same time. Hope this helps explain it! Jacque",

I get to have a little chemo break, too!  We are going to the Elton John concert the weekend after I was suppose to have my next chemo.  My onc said he wanted to see me up dancing and enjoying myself (he is going to the concert, too) so he moved my tx to the next week.  Yea!  Now, if my scans just cooperate next week and show that my tx is working, I'll be set!  B445 - so sorry about your port - that stinks!  My first port, four years ago was horrible the whole year I had it.  It always hurt, would never draw blood - I hated it.  My present port is great - no pain, I forget it is there, draws like a dream.  Prayers for an excellent one this time! Topo - So glad you are getting a good response!  Keep kicking that beasts hinney!",

Congratulations on the good scans! I had been doing dose dense infusions of Abraxane and Avastin the last six months, but changed to weekly this week due to side effects.  So far, it has been much easier on me - hope that keeps up! I had a scan in June which showed some areas of improvement and some areas stable.  I am due for another scan on the 24th of this month.  I am a little apprehensive as my TMs have risen some and some other numbers have increased on lab work.  Like all of us, I SO want this to work - and I SO want to get a nice long dance with NED.  How have your side effects been?
