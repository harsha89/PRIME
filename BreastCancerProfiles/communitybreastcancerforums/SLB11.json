I had a mastectomy on Oct. 18 for DCIS. Final pathology showed a 4mm area of invasive. Oncotype came back 34% I've gotten 3 very different opinions from different oncologists, but after the high oncotype score and being only 30 it seems its in my best interest to do the chemo. I am scared to death to have long term side effects from treatment! Glad I found somewhere to come for support! :-)",
