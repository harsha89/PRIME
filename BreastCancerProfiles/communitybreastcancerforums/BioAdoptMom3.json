I am 51 and my history is that I have been called back for repeat mammograms 4 times.  This is the 3rd time a biopsy has been recommended (ultrasound guided).  What concerns me this time is that each of the times before the techs and radiologists have been pretty positive, saying things like its not likely to be cancer, but we should do this to be certain.  When I had my 2nd mammo and ultrasound on Wednesday this radiologist seemed pretty grim telling me that he didn't like what he saw, the solid mass with jagged edges and he stated he was concerned, that I should have the biopsy asap.  The ultrasound tech was pretty somber too, telling me twice she was sorry I had to face bad news right before Christmas.  On a more positive note, my gyn called me personally yesterday AM and told me to try not to worry and enjoy my Christmas, and to be aware that a great deal of these masses like mine do turn out to be benign.  My question, and I know no one can know for sure without the biopsy, but do you think it is much more likely that this is cancer because of the reactions of the tech and radiologist, or do you think it was probably just a different personality delivering the news?  This was done at the same imaging center as the others have been, but always different radiologists.  Thanks for any comments or experiences you can share, positive or negative!  I want honesty because I want to be prepared.

If you have been on this and had problems with it, was it OK to stop taking it?  I don't want to cause any recovery problems, but I certainly don't want to have to deal with this either. Thanks!
