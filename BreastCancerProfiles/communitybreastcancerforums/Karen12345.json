Up until about 5 months ago I was still working full time, age 68, with some plans to retire soon. But i was forced to resign now because of my diagnosis. I am on iBrance and letrozole for hormonal therapy and completed 10 whole brain radiation sessions on August 18, 2017. In last two weeks weeks I am suffering severe loss of appetite, amazing unrelenting fatigue, and lightheadedness. I really don't drive so I always have to get someone to take me places. I am lucky to have two supportive sisters. But I have no energy, my brain feels like it's floating, lightheaded, etc. and I cannot do much but sit on the couch. I try to take short walks once in a while by motivation is low and energy is low. Not feeling good right now, feeling discouraged and depressed and weird.. I am age 68 so don't have a lot of time!
