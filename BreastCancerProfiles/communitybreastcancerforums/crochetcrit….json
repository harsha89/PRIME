I had a lumpectomy, then (in order to get a clean margin) a wide excision where most of the lymph nodes under left arm were taken. It was just before they decided that sentinel node testing was the way to go. So, now I have a \"hole\" under my arm. I then had a full course of radiation (six weeks as I remember) and 5 years of Tamoxifen. Positives? I don't need to shave there. :-) I know this is probably a \"trivial\" thought on my part, but 20 years ago no one said anything about being able to get bras that took into effect the two different size breasts. Now that I am older (I am 74, but very active) I see that the radiated breast is firm and perky (hurts like hell when I go for mammograms) and the cancer free one is droopy. I wondered why all my dance clothes kept shifting to the right. I think not having a good bra that differentiates the breast might be the reason. I see very little about bras, but a friend who is just out of radiation is going to get fitted for one to take into account breast size difference. I'm wondering whether I can still get this kind of help. I know it's vanity...but hell with it. I went through all the pain, and yes I am (knock on wood) cancer free, but I still like to look good and have clothes fit well. Any thoughts on this? I will be seeing a new surgeon (mine retired) as I feel privileged to be able to still see a surgeon yearly, and I see someone at the oncology center every year too. I feel that I need to be proactive to see that if there is ever a recurrence it is found early.",
