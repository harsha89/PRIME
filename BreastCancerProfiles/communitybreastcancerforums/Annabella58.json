Actually, I will ask you to go to the Exchange City thread.  They are the most wonderful, knowledgeable group of ladies on there, and can really help! Tell them, Annie sent you and they will surely help.....I am glad nothing is leaking, that is great news.  The cost for a breast surgeon is no more than a co pay, depending on your insurance, should be 25-75.00 out of pocket co pay. If you don't have insurance, make the appointment anyway, and then tell them your situation. I had none when I got my first case of bc, and they worked out a very easy payment schedule for me.  This will all work out, but go on over to exchange city and ask them to give you a helping hand. take care, it will be fine.

      "Content": "Sep 25, 2010 12:15PM - edited Sep 25, 2010 12:29PM by Annabella58 Sweetheart, you are right to look into this.  That said, an inverted nipple is something that you should actually see a breast surgeon about.  Don't worry, the chances of something being cancer at  your young age are extremely slim.  Also, they cannot really do a mammogram on you, as young breast are very dense. However, a breast surgeon is the person who can really lay your mind to rest.  Since you have pain, (sure, diet can do this, as in caffeine) you may have a fibroid or something that is benign but that should come out.  My sister did, at 19.  It wasn't any big deal, and she's never had a thing since, but if there is breast cancer in the family, or even if there isn't, get thee to a breast surgeon pronto.  (JIC, god forbid, there is something, you need to see one ASAP.) Since it does not show up on U/S, it sounds like a benign fluid filled cyst, but you are more than wise to check it out.  A benign cyst can wax and wane with your periods, but it won't show up on an ultrasound.  A fibroid will, so that lets that out.  Do you have any leaking from your nipple?  Are you on birth control pills?  There may be a hormonal imbalance also, that could cause these things. You don't mention your dr. as being a breast surgeon, but call your OB/GYN or your GP and ask for a referral.  If you post where you are, we can refer you to someone.  Then go, and continue being such a wonderful, pro active lady on behalf of your own health! You are the age of my own daughter and I am very proud of you for addressing this, but please know that your age will probably rule very much in your favor.  That said, it is not impossible, so for your own sake I would push you to do this. p.s. If you did see a breast surgeon, I would continue to push that doctor for further testing...you can and should have an MRI which isn't any big deal and should be covered by your insurance.  Insist on one.  Take care of you! love annie",

She did tell us some people have thin skin.  But as she is at college, she doesn't eat properly and I second new becca's advice, esp. vitamin C.  Smoking also depletes your body of C, so that can be a cause of those bruises....take a good multi vitamin honey and try not to worry.",

If a surgeon says \"suspicious\" etc., go and get the core biopsy.  There is no down side to getting one (except it hurts a bit, take some tylenol) and makes you nervous until you get results (take an antianxiety pill) but most of all, if it is cancer, you need to catch is super early!!!   That way you'll be just fine.  Either way, you'll be fine. Good luck to you!!

From there, you can work out a plan that you CAN afford, even if it is as little as 15.00/month.  If you evince willingness to work with them, and you go to them, you cannot be put into collection, legally.  Stay tough, insist on your figure that it is all you can do, but reiterate that you are willing to pay your bill, you just need to be able to do it in a way that you can afford. This will save your credit, your finances, and avoid collection.  Do not worry, this can be done, as I did it.  It is now 9 years since all that began, we are still paying it off (I got a plan of 100.00/month) but you can do it too.

So that is very good news and hopefully, no nodes, a quick fix, and no chemo.  I had an early stage, no nodes, and all I had was a lumpectomy, radiation (8 weeks, but 5 minutes, like a dentist x ray) and follow up meds.  Tamoxifen for 5 years, no issues, healed fast, felt well.. God bless you, hope you find out more and better news tomorrow, like what stage, next steps....once you have a plan, you can cope and it goes much better.

She was 12 when I had cancer the first time.  Since the breasts are so very dense, I would not put your daughters thru a mammogram, as they cannot see anything nor do I believe any doctor would let you have a script for that.  I would wait and when they are older, encourage them to get mammograms when they feel the need to.  But I was told that no one, unless they have a mom  or a strong family cancer history (we did not, I am the first I know of), needs one until at least 30. Since I was 35, I am leaving it up to my daughter to get one when she feels she should.  If she wanted to start at 28 or so, well, that is her choice.  Earlier, if she wants to, and someone will give her a script. I certainly wouldn't subject your young girls to anything of the sort.  They are unable to test for BRAC gene until they are 25 anyway.  That's just my opinion, but good luck.  My hope is that in the next five or ten years, there will be a better answer for our daughters.  I know mine is already scared, and she is only 21. I would share with them that there are things they can do for now to keep them healthy.....when they develop breasts, they can self check them.  They can eat healthfully with lots of fruits and veggies.  They can omit alcohol.  They can not smoke.  They can stay away from the pill as contraception.  Hopefully these things can empower them to not worry so much.  My heart goes out to you, as mine was the same age....tell them mommy is a Viking warrior and that you are going to win, and that's that.  In your own head, tell it just to get the He** out, wrong girl, period.

Also, having had bc twice, they don't usually wait on scheduling a biopsy....if they thought it was needed, they'd have you scheduled for an MRI too.

If you had a normal mammogram a year ago, there is no reason to suspect that you would have anything going on.  While yes, things do happen, unless you have an abnormal mammo or they want you to have an MRI, then there is no reason to think this, other than fear of it? I think that for your own peace of mind your best course of action is the mammo.  Then, until then, to ease your mind, I think this may be related to your work, honestly and muscle spasms. Bodies are usually aching for reasons.  In your line of work there is a lot of sitting still.  You are at peri menopause age.  Lots of things begin to ache at this stage.  Peri menopause causes aches, pains and stabby boobs.  Also what side do you use or reach with?  Sounds like body mechanics to  me may be the culprit. If it were me, I'd go to my GP and rule out lyme disease, or even beginning arthritis.  You may just need some exercise.  Get a good CBC blood test and if everything seems normal, then go get that mammo and rule that out too. Unless you have a strong family history of breast cancer, or have had it before, there is no reason you should think it is stage 4!  Or even breast cancer.  Go see your GP and get your mammo and good luck.  I believe you will be just fine, hon.",

Yes, your body still makes estrogen from your adrenal glands.  Just a small amount. This will put you into surgical menopause if you have not done it(no biggie for me at all) and if you are past menopause it gave me great peace of mind. There is much discussion on whether it affects your bone density, risk of dementia, blah de blah, but I have no substantiated studies on these....according to every dr. I spoke with (some at Yale and some at Memorial Sloan in NYC) these are \"perhaps\" scenarios. I did this about 4 years ago and have never looked back.  In fact, due to my high estrogenic content, one dr. told me \"you just saved your own life\". Easy surgery, boring recovery.  Go for it, but research if first.  It's a very personal decision. Good luck!",

I have learned in all of this stuff (10 years worth) that if it: Is painful and shrinks and grows with your cycle Is smooth, oval or round and moves easily and is easily palpable they generally have found it to be a cyst; either fluid filled or what is called a fibroadenoma, a benign growth.  These lovely little items increase with age, esp. as we become pre menopausal.  It sounds like it should be just fine, but am saying a little prayer for you anyway.  I'm glad you are getting it checked out.  If they want to biopsy it, no worries, quick and just a needle and you're shot full of novocaine.  It truly does sound cyst=ey, but I know what a pain in the rear it is figuring out these things on weekend.  You'll feel alot better, once they U/S it and can see if that's all it is, and it sure sounds like it.

I think there are other organs that weigh in from time to time, like the adrenals, which secrete small amnts of estrogen, and your uterus also, if you still have it. Ah, what we girls go thru....men couldn't do it :). (my sisters liken it to your body in \"reverse puberty\".  Everything feels weird, etc.) Hope this helps, but if you are worried, you can always run it by your OB/GYN. When I developed my \"meno pot\" or \"keg\", I was like, \"what the f***?\"  I'd always had a literally concave tummy, even after pregnancy.  This most unwelcome development had me run to the OB/GYN only to get \"yeah, that happens\"....oh good. Good luck, sounds fine tho.  I'm in recon too, don't worry about a thing, it will all end up looking fine, believe it or not.  It's like your body goes into warp shock afterwards. Question for you....two timer bc here, trying to get someone to pull out the girl equipment, and they won't even discuss it, want to put me on chemically induced (Lupron) menopause....you say you took the ovaries out, how did that happen, and would you go for it again? have a good recovery, it will pass....takes awhile, tho! Your new foob will be beautiful, and you'll need some patience, as when you look at it initially, you are not seeing how it'll happen, but it will! love annie",

Second, my daughter is your age and BC has been an issue for her also.........grandma had it (good news is she was a grandma!:) and I have had it twice.  She is very worried about getting mammograms, and when to start that (continual answer, 25) and you will be happy to know that she has been told, as have I, that there is no reason to get them so young, other than for peace of mind...that said.... I would ABSOLUTELY go get genetic testing.  If you have the gene, and even if you don't, going with a \"christina applegate\" recon is one great way to never have to worry about this ever again.  I have told my daughter that I will be doing that for the non recon girl (and at 52, a boob job is a good thing) and i have encouraged her to get genetic testing.  With your family history, I think a good dr. or breast surgeon will give you a script for it so that insurance can cover this test which is very expensive, a few thousand. A great deal of peace of mind, but even then, if you want to be sure, I would monitor, self examine, and get to know a great breast surgeon as they can evaluate lumps more easily than you ,freaking yourself out in the shower as of course, we all do.  It's way too much stress for a young girl!  Push for that MRI too, as Caya says..it's not scarey, not painful, and my mammo and blood tests and great exams did NOT catch last years 1.5 cm lump which was indeed another bc.  MRIs are a great tool in the arsenal.  This too can be covered by insurance if you carry that gene or are at high risk which with the family history, can help you get covered for that.  (BTW, I don't have the gene.  I was told in genetic counselling that everyone has their own specific case....you could have a strong family history and not have the gene, or a negative family history and have it) I am on the other side of recon, and I must say, that I now have a boob that rivals the original, and bennie, won't ever sag.  So going Bev. Hills, is a definite plus in my book. Your age is on your side as well, but an MRI, an annual mammo and a good surgeon to consult with would be helpful for you, honey, as well as that genetic test.  More good news for you and my daughter........my oncologist informs me that with all the research they hope to have a vaccine for this in ten years!!! I do hope so, that was the best news yet. Have not heard of the primrose oil and vitamin E, you might want another opinion on that one if so.  Another opinion on anything always, is a good idea.  It's your life and your one and only body, you want to take good care of it! Best of luck to you and congrats again on the great news.  xoxo annie",

I know it's easy to say don't stress, but really what will that do for you, besides upset you?  Chances are good that you've eliminated most of your trouble causers (I know mine was definitely estrogen caused) and you could try eating 9 servings of veggies and fruit and do stay away from the two things you mention.  Life is a crap shoot anyway, and it sounds like you are doing a good job of staying healthy!  It's pretty aggressive, but have you considered prophylactic mastecomy?  I think your insurance might go for it and the reconstruct (I have one, it's awesome, truly rivals the original) if your dr. can show evidence of a medical reason why.  It would be one way to absolutely level the playing field. Good luck with everything, I will pray for you to be just fine.  PM me if I can help you out at all. I've been there, and terrified sucks.  be well annie",

ER+ HER2-, 0/2 nodes, no invasion Second time around, both times node negative and tho this one was invasive type, it had not gone anywhere.  They speculate that since it was only found by MRI, (did not have one in 2001), that it was a tiny piece they missed that first go round that was held in check by the tamoxifen.  One year later, it had grown, and the MRI found it, tho the mammo was still negative. Since I had had rads 1st time at bat, they gave me CMF chemo this time, 8 txtmnts, lupron shots to let me have arimidex,since I'd already had 5 years of tamoxifen 1st time, then I opted for an ooph/hys and stopped the Lupron. So far, so good, 3 years out from diagnosis, but two times weary of this....had a skin sparing mastectomy w/recon this time (same boob, and PS fixed some issues with the previous lumpectomy) and now I am gearing myself up as I want to do a prophy.  I sure wish I'd done both of them the first time! So I think I belong here..........?? Good luck to all of you. xoxo annie",

I had delayed....in fact, I'm still a work in progress.  I had TE put in, but then sprung a leak, I guess you could call it?  The previously irradiated skin from the first lumpectomy, broke thru and I had to do chemo (couldn't get rads) but first they had to patch the break thru.  I wasn't healed up til 3 months just at the cut off date for starting chemo when we had to start, to had to quit, wait, get chemo for six months, as it was CMF, then heal up from that, and begin again with expanding, etc.  Which by that time, I was so excited to do!  They did expand me just a teeny weeny bit in the OR as I did not want to wake up flat, and then it broke down, got necrosis, but they fixed it all up and now, I have a great foob.  However,,,,still no fipple, as my PS wants to wait until I get my prophy so that I can match.  That won't be until the late summer next year, as my daughter graduates college and I want to be there.  So I will be lopsided for awhile yet.  This is why I can so get on board with anyone who does both.  Waiting for this is a total drag, going thru it again is a drag, but I'll get there!  So will you, SueZ!!

I think you will do just fine! Happy holidays",

Kate, hi!  I had GINORMOUS relief when I found out my D was low and began supplementing.  It's like my fibro went away.  I was told only to supplement up to 2,000 ius and oh, the relief! Going to try magnesium also, as my GP tells me calcium needs it to bind to bone. xoxo",

Replens gave me such UTIS....argggghhhh.  So did Rephresh.  My onc said NO WAY NO HOW to any estrogen anything as I was the estrogen queen. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Mar 18, 2011 08:30AM - edited Mar 18, 2011 08:34AM by Annabella58 HI, the onc  is the end person who makes the call, here.  The surgeon will disagree, the PS will disagree, your GP will disagree and so will any doctor you see.  It's incredibly annoying and very common!  They will all need to confirm together what the call is, once they can talk and have an oncotype score to go by. I had invasive, and all my drs. (including my GP) still disagree on everything.  The onc is the penultimate authority regarding cancer .  If you want a surgical opinion, then BS is who you ask.  If you want a cosmetic question and a surgical question answered, then your PS is who to go to.   If you have a supplement issue, then it's your GP.  Going forward, however, do not take any supplements, or do anything without checking with your onc first, as he has now become your top guy.  See if you can talk to someone re: CMF chemo and if it makes sense in your scenario.  See what your oncotype score comes back as, as that will define  your treatment. CMF is very, very doable and you do not lose your hair, either.  It takes 6 months, but it is only once every 3 weeks.  My Onc at first said to get the more aggressive chemo, as \"I'd be done faster\", but I pointed out that he had no hair, and that my hair was important to me.  He said it was fine, studies have shown no difference in either treatment longterm.  If the cancer types as aggressive, and the oncotype is mid range or higher, they may reccomend chemo.  It's not as bad as you've heard, for many women.  Not your grandmothers' chemo, anymore, with great drugs for SEs. Bottom line, the oncotype will show if you need more aggressive txmnt or not.  I came in at 17, high end of low, so they said CMF was fine.  I could not have rads so I had to do chemo, and mtxmy with recon. Good luck!!!!!!!!!!",
