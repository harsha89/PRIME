After radiation, I developed a bruised feeling along my ribs by the bra line underneath my arm. The radiation oncologist said it was impossible that the radiation caused the pain. He insisted that I injured myself during the surgery (lumpectomy). I thought that was very odd because I did not have that pain after my surgery. Well, it's been almost two years since my surgery and the pain kind of comes and goes. I also noticed quite a bit of asymmetry in that area. A very pronounced lump with dimpling. I visited my oncologist and she basically said it was just my body shape, indicating that it was caused by being overweight. I had wanted a referral to a L/E therapist but they told me it was not necessary. Well, during the last three months it's has become painful again and I developed a red marking that does not go away. I again went to my my oncologist and they said it was nothing and made me feel ridiculous for bringing it up. They are basically telling me that it's fat. Well now I have developed a red area on my waist line on the same side that does not go away. I then decided to visit my GP thinking maybe it's something totally unrelated to my cancer treatment. She noticed the asymmetrical area and upon a physical exam said that it appears that the area is quite sensitive and the pain appears to be between the rib cage. She ordered X-rays and they came back normal. Thank goodness. She told me to wait and talk to my oncologist which I have an appoint in late June. I am sure that something is not right because of the discoloration at the bra line and at the waist area and the constant pain. My oncologist said the pain was from referred pain from the lumpectomy and the redness is because my skin is thin and showing the blood vessels. Though this discoloration doesn't happen on any other area of my body but the treated side. Please let me know if this sounds like L/E. I know you are suppose to be proactive with L/E so that it doesn't progress. Thanks for any feedback!",

Aloe Vera gel is so far the best product to apply. I am also using Mia-Derm and not so much the Aquaphor ointment, too greasy. In addition, I found the tightest bra that had for running and that seemed to help prevent any movement and that seemed to help me a great deal. My painful swollen breast got much better over the weekend. I originally started on a Thursday and that wasn't too bad because it was only 2 days. The five days will be difficult but there is a respite during the weekend. The only other thing I have noticed is that some of my internal stitches from my lumpectomy and SNB are popping up. I spoke with my RO today and he said just to leave it alone and that they couldn't possibly remove them because they don't even have a tweezer. My RO doesn't have the best bedside manner as well. Good luck to you, I am sure that you will have 2 days off since this was your 5th treatment and you will feel a ton better. You might check with your RO about the hypofractionated radiation therapy that is only 15 weeks like I am having done. It is suppose to be easier for large breasted woman, not as many skin side effects. Here's a link discussing its: http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/benefits... https://www.mdanderson.org/transcripts/cancer-news... A question for everyone: Today was my 8th treatment and the entire time spent being \"radiated\" was extremely short, maybe a minute, usually it's 4 to 5 minutes. I am estimating here though. Has anyone experienced shorter sessions?",

Didn't really care for him but oh well. He made me feel stupid for asking questions. My other doctors seemed to welcome questions. He was having an intern in the room, perhaps he felt I was questioning him in front of the intern. I am going to receive 3 weeks @ 15 treatments which is the accelerated whole breast program. I asked about the boost and he said it was not necessary since my margins were clear. I thought the boost to the tumor bed was standard treatment? Is anyone having their treatments in a prone position vs. supine? He said that I would be on my back. I had researched that the treatment is more effective and less side effects on your stomach for large breasted women (C cup or over). He told me that there would be minor skin irritation and virtually no fatigue. This is different than what I see being posted online. I am mostly concerned with my skin since I have large breasts and I have heard that there may be more side effects. I go in tomorrow to have my CAT scan, tattoo, and measurements done. They will call me to set up my radiation schedule soon. A lot of people are talking about a simulation and molds? They did not mention that at all. They said I would be measured (CAT scan) and the computer would calculate my treatment plan. Can't wait for this to be done to go back to my so-called normal life!",

It's right at the level of where the band of my bra hits. In addition, everything seems to be stiffening up in that area, like my shoulder. I am not sure if this is normal. The radiation oncologist said I should have virtually no symptoms except for possibly skin irritation. I guess I will mention it on Monday. My oncologist sent me a letter today about joining the clinical PALLAS study, see below. Has anyone else been asked to participate in this study? The side effects sound pretty severe with white blood counts being low. Like 85-90%! Would like to but I am afraid of the side effects. Will have to discuss more with my doctor after my radiation treatment is done. PALLAS is an abbreviation for PALbociclib CoLlaborative Adjuvant Study. The PALLAS Trial (NCT02513394) is exploring whether palbociclib, a targeted medication taken with adjuvant endocrine therapy, will decrease the chance of breast cancer coming back beyond endocrine therapy alone. The PALLAS Trial (NCT02513394) is for people who have had a diagnosis of hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer and are receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy. Adjuvant endocrine therapy is treatment that is given after surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy; examples include tamoxifen and/or aromatase inhibitors (eg, anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane). BRANCE may cause serious side effects, including: Low white blood cell counts (neutropenia). Low white blood cell counts are very common when taking IBRANCE and may cause serious infections that can lead to death. Your doctor should check your white blood cell counts before and during treatment. If you develop low white blood cell counts during treatment with IBRANCE, your doctor may stop your treatment, decrease your dose, or may tell you to wait to begin your treatment cycle. Tell your doctor right away if you have signs and symptoms of low white blood cell counts or infections such as fever and chills. Before you take IBRANCE, tell your doctor if you: Common side effects of IBRANCE include:",

My radiation oncologist does not believe that radiation causes fatigue. He thinks it's actually good for your body. He doesn't believe plutonium causes cancer either. He's quite an oddball. He told me that for years he didn't believe that a woman's breast could swell from radiation. He finally accepted it a few years ago and said he didn't know what he was thinking. He said that there are virtually no side effects from radiation. A professional has indicated that he knows what he is doing. I hope so! So yesterday I felt like I was going to go to sleep driving there. The nurses suggested that I exercise which was what I have been doing. So I force myself to walk last night.

I have noticed that the skin on my nipple is scabbing and starting to come off. My fatigue is getting better and I just have the nagging burning in my nipple. I saw the RO Friday and he said that within two weeks my skin should be better. Anyone else out there have pealing skin on their nipple? I am going to start my Tamoxifen next week, kind of nervous but I'm sure it will be fine. Has anyone else started their Tamoxifen yet?",

Thoughts on follow up visits, my Nurse Practitioner wants me to see her instead of my oncologist for my regular checkups. I am not sure how I feel. I want a cancer specialist doctor to tell me at each visit that I'm ok. Is an NP qualified to take over? My gut says to see an actual doctor due to the seriousness of cancer. The NP also recommends for me to have my first mammo at my 1 year anniversary instead of six months post treatment. She thinks I will be less sore. Is this a good idea  ",

The fires are still burning and we are getting a lot of smoke. The first night we came home I saw two hot spots on the hillside! Each night I check but haven't seen anything since Sunday When I first saw the NP I thought it would be nice in addition to seeing my oncologist regularly. She told me that she covered survivorship topics and wanted me to make an appointment 4-8 weeks after treatment ended. I had an existing appointment setup with my oncologist for the end of October. As soon as I set up my appointment with the NP Kaiser cancelled my appointment with my oncologist without telling me. I was upset and had them add my appointment back in for the oncologist. I have an appointment on October 27 for my first check up and will ask her. I'm afraid that she will want me to see the NP because it's probably cheaper so I'm a little afraid to ask.",

I think the allergic reaction to the surgical prep overwhelmed my lymphatic system and the swollen spots on my breast I think were lymph nodes in overdrive because of the surgery and allergic reaction.

It was horrible at work today, it feels like I have rope burn on my nipple. My lumpectomy scar is around the aeorele, perhaps that's contributing to the irritation. My breast is swollen and red but not painful. I am afraid that it will become unbearable since I have 9 more sessions. This is an odd question I want to ask. I had to immediately stop taking my birth control pills after my diagnosis. After that my nipples have stayed erect and have become sensitive to touch. I thought maybe I was pregnant and took a test and it was negative. Has anyone experienced this? It is quite odd and I believe has also contributed to my soreness during radiation   ",

SusanGA - I know exactly how you feel, I am about 4 weeks out and have been waiting for my Oncotype DX results to come in to see if I need chemo and my doctor emails that they haven't come in yet and that I should postpone my appointment for this Wednesday. I wouldn't be able to reschedule until 7/28. I was freaking out and decided to call pathology and they had emailed my oncologist that very morning! I am keeping my appointment for tomorrow and they told me the results early, 16! It's a low score so I don't think I will have to have chemo! I can start rads and hormone therapy. I will find everything out tomorrow. This whole process is SO STRESSFUL, not knowing what your life is going to be for 6 months. Good luck with getting your results soon. It was like a weight lifted off myshoulders when I found out the score.",

I was very anxious about going back to work this week. I was afraid of all the attention that I would receive. It was fine, most people were very caring and it was nice to feel so welcomed back. A few didn't acknowledge anything as well. A few male co-workers could not keep their eyes off my breasts when they first saw me. Their eyes were drawn like magnets. Men! I don't know why, but I found this hilarious. Has anyone else found people staring at their chests?",
