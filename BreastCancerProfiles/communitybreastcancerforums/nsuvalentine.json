    "Content": "nsuvalentine wrote: I have been tested for the BRCA1 & 2 gene and the test was negative for both.  I have always felt very lucky since my grandmother died at 48 from breast cancer, her sister has had breast and ovarian cancer before the age of 50, and I have breast cancer on my other side of my family in my grandmother and aunt, and my mother tested positive for both genes and has done preventative surgery to prevent cancer.  So, I found a lump in my breast and have made a doctor's appointment.  I assumed that since I did not have the gene and was still under 40 I didn't have much to be concerned with.  So, my questions is:  What is my risk since I'm 27 and do not have the gene?  I guess I'm looking for a percentage.
