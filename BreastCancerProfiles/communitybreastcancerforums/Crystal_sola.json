    "Content": "Crystal_sola wrote: After receiving my oncotype score of 3, my MO and I decided against chemotherapy and I prepared for rads. At my CT scan/ planning session, the radiologist noted enlarged internal mammary nodes. MO advises this could be inflammation, orders PET Scan. PET Scan results in 3 hot spots, one axillary node in right armpit (surgeon thought he removed all nodes) and IMLN on left and right of sternum. Entire team is now in disagreement in how to proceed. (Actually they dont even agree about the IMLN on the left) MO advises that biopsy of IMLN is extremely dangerous, as it is very close to my aorta, and advises against it. MO also says the hot spots on the PET could be inflammation. So what the heck was the use of doing the PET? I was so ready to start treatment, and now I am in limbo. Waiting for more opinions from more specialists, and meanwhile I'm freaking out that I still have cancer in my body after all that I've been through to get rid of it. I just emailed a list of questions to MO, but if anyone can give advice, I'd appreciate it. My MO keeps citing my oncotype score as reason not to worry, not to be in a hurry, but wouldn't my score be wrong now if my lymph node count changed? She says they dont normally see IMLNs except in patients where there were many positive axillary, and even supraclavicular nodes, in which case chemotherapy would have been advised and oncotype would not even have been ordered. So the IMLNs (if they are positive, and how would we know if we cannot biopsy?) would call for chemo, while my low onco score calls for no chemo. Radiologist doesn't want to radiate without definitive diagnosis because of risks to heart on left. So here I sit. Help!
