I goggled it and Paget disease and eczema ate the 2 main discussions. I have an appointment tomorrow worth my dr who is a MD but not for this reason I'm actuality going for physical therapy. I will make every attempt and my mission to find out. The weird thing is I'm 48 lost weight and my breast tissue always seems to be the 1st to go. I seriously consider a enhancement with my expected tax refund. I want bigger boobs not breast cancer damiit Pray for me please (edited to remove photos) Log in to post a reply",
