I believe to this day, my son saved my llife by alerting me to the fact that there was indeed a serious problem.  This child was a seriously hungry boy.  Bless this now, 6'2, 225 lb child he  has grown to be today, sitting in the next room, studying hard for  optometry school entrance exams.  You and babe wiill be just fine.   As nene wrote, the future does take care of itself. Peace be with you.",

Renegade, stupid, malformed cells  that do not have the ability or know how, to shut themselves down. YOU, are infinitely smarter than they are - seek in addition to your outer physicians, you inner physician wisdom. Do visualizations?",
