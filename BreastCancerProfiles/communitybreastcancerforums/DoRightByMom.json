    "Content": "DoRightByMom wrote: Hello -- My Mom received a bad mamogram (5 cm irregular shape) and we are scheduled to have a biopsy later this week. We are in Georgia but will travel to other areas of the country for, e.g., a specialist who has worked extensively with elderly women and/or a doctor who has a handle on alternative treatments that are effective but more gentle than the standard.  My Mom is otherwise in pretty good health so we don't want to do anything that would compromise her qualtity of life at this point.  The rigors of chemo seem nightmarish when you consider her age and we are not exactly doing backflips about the idea of surgery (because of anesthesia, etc.)  In a perfect world, I would be able to find a gifted and world renowned natreopath who can do wonders with alternative medicine ala Suzanne Somers.  Alas, this isn't a perfect world so I guess we have to rely on Western Meds -- I just want to find a hospital/MD who is going to give her the best possible care available -- i.e, just keep this thing from getting worse. I have even read about risks associated with the biopsy. Please respond -- I feel like I am in a daze; scared to death that I am going to lead her in the wrong direction and compromise her remaining years by going to a doctor who just goes along with standard protocol, etc. Any words of guidance or encouragement would be so completely appreciated.  In the meantime, peace, prayers and blessings to all who are on here and reading this and going through your own thing.
