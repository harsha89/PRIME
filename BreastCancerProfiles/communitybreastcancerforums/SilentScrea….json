Thanks so much for the informed entries on this thread! Of course, for some of them I'm going to need medical interpretation, but at least it gives me some informed questions to ask the doctor when I go in for my one-month checkup! My next quest is to find out how y'all deal with well-meaning family and friends who ask you how you're doing and then spend 30 minutes telling you about their aches and pains. Will this ever end? Thanks again!",
