It made the recovery longer and much more painful and still annoys me to bits. The reason they leave it sometimes is that if you were to have a reconstruction later on, it helps to attach skin/fat/muscle and make a nipple out of etc. Mine disturbed me a lot and i couldn't seem to find out if it was normal or not. When in the hospital, a nurse was distressed by it and called a specialist to look at it, which worried the hell out of me. As you said, it is like another boob under your arm, mine is too large and has been so uncomfortable. I was annoyed that mine had been left though, as i had stated that i would not be having a reconstruction down the line, but I guess they think that you may chage your mind. I now have BRCA2 and have to have the other breast removed, so will have to have the \"Dog ear\" tidied up, as my breast surgeon called it. So will have pain on both sides then, - oh joy !! The pain you feel is known to occur with some people and if you have been given exercises to do, keep doing them or introduce gentle swimming. It's to do with the nerves and fluid. Did you have lympth nodes out too ? Accupunture is supposed to be very good for the pain also. Hope this helps :) Bel",

      "Content": "Jul 15, 2009 08:04PM - edited Jul 15, 2009 08:08PM by bel My mother had breast cancer 5 years ago, at the age of 69, her mother died of ovarian cancer at the same age and I got breast cancer last August. I too tested negative. Later on, the lab that was looking at my mum's tests concluded that she was positive; my lab re-looked at my results and agreed, so I then tested positive......... I tell you this because you shouldn't ever overlook the risks still as even if the test is negitive, if you have family history, your risks are higher and if it is genetic, but you are the only person to develop it, it may go undiscovered as being genetic forever, or your mother could even get it after you. BRCA2 causes breast cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer, so if you even suspect you have this, please be vigilant. I have to have a further mastectomy and a full hysterectomy and I am only 38.",
