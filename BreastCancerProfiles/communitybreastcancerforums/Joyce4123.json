She also had WBR a year and a half ago and also had SRS surgery last April   I do believe each person is completely different in the way they react to all of these treatments of the brain.  She has tried Tykerb and Tramodol w/no success.  There are so many things doctors can do now and as I said each person reacts differently to those treatments so you could definitely be one of those who has great results!  I hope for all the best for you and that you continue the fight.  Joyce",
