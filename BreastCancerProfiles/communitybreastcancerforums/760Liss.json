I got a little bump on my areola that started to itch and went away after a few days. Then it flaked over and started to swell and itch again. I've been getting a few pains in my right breast but fear it might just be my anxiety. My dermatologist had me on a 3 week waiting list and I feel like it's getting more irritating and swollen everyday. I called the nearest Dr and have an appointment at 10am . I'm kind of scared and right there with you. I pray the best for your results.",
