I had 3 C-sections and wished it was availalbe for my.  Also, a OR nurse girlfriend told me to ask the anistialogoist for Zofran which helps with nausea after you wake that was a true help also.  I was out the next day and had a 4 hour journey home.  I have 3 little ones so when I got home I put a large bandaid on my sweater to remind them of my boo-boo.  Hoping they won't touch.  I am still awaiting my full biopsy report but lymph nodes were clear.  I feel good about the decision.  DCIS- but my foob looks awful- but even just 5 days into it, I see the light at the end of the tunnel- swelling has gone down and as the tissue expander gets larger it won't be so bad.  End result is- I spend everyday with my kids and husband.  By the way.. He too keeps telling me my foob looks great!  They really do love us  Best of Luck Ladies and don't let the fear overwhelm you-your strong enough to have made the decision thus far. ",
