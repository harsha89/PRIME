We analyzed 100 cases of brachial plexopathy to determine which clinical criteria helped differentiate tumor from radiation injury. Seventy-eight patients had tumor and 22 had radiation injury. Severe pain occurred in 80% of tumor patients but in only 19% of patients with radiation injury. The lower trunk was involved in 72% of the tumors. Seventy-eight percent of the radiation injuries affected the upper plexus (C5-6). Horner syndrome was more common in tumor, and lymphedema in radiation injury. The time from RT to onset of plexus symptoms, and the dose of RT, also differed.",

Just ER & PR negative ?    If you are Triple Negative I would be more than happy to share with you what I know / have experienced, etc.... Trust me girl, I have done my research and have also found some great places to get answers.   As far as being HER+, I don't have experience with that but I believe one of the differences is that you would be eligible for Herceptin whereas I am not ( being Triple Negative) ....
