Try to do something to treat yourself every week you go through chemo! Drink as much water as you can possibly get down and rest as much as you can. I finished my 12 weeks of taxol and 8 weeks of every other week AC April 2016 and it already seems like such a distant memory. Us triple negative girls have to fight extra hard and throw everything modern medicine has to offer at this beast to defeat it. I had a couple setbacks during chemo with needing to receive blood a couple of times and ended up in the hospital once due to neutropenia, but it was all worth it once we saw the positive results at the end of chemo. And, taxol was much easier for me than AC was, so please don't stop now! You can do it!! Do talk to your doctor and also don't be afraid to seek help from any counselors you can talk to. Wishing you the best with your treatments!",
