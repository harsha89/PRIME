      "Content": "RoseOOPs wrote: Biopsy was done earlier today. This is the first time I've actually been up. Came home and went straight to the couch and laid there all day. I'm not going to sugar coat this at all. \"It was not fun and it is very uncomfortable\". The mass was located very very close to the chest wall. My breast was numb but when the put the wire in the doctor would occasionally hit my pec muscles that is what hurt. I think if the mass was not so deep it would have been much better. The biopsy itself I don't remember, they knock me out really good. They doctors did say that the removed the whole mass because it was small, 1 cm. My whole breast is bandaged and I've been sleeping with an ice pack all day. I will have my results on Thursday. I am so glad this is over. I feel like I'm closer to getting my life back. Over the past two months I've been so nervous that all I did was eat. This resulted in a hugh weight gain. I have all was tried to watch my diet and exercised everyday. Well all that went to hell. I can't wait to lose this weight and work out again. It seems like I spent my whole day on the computer looking up masses and cysts etc. I just hope all this is behind me now. So for everyone waiting to go for a biopsy; If you have what I had (core biopsey with removal of small mass) there is some discomfort, but it will be over and you are closer to getting your life back. Rose PS If this doesn't make sense it is due to the fact the meds might not have wore off. Log in to post a reply",
