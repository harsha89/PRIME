I suffered from breast cancer in late 1991 and thank God for carrying me through, being a suvivor until now. I had undergone mastectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy in late 1991 until mid 1992. I started having lymphedema in my right arm after 5 years or so. The lymphedema treatment and support is not very sufficient in Hong Kong and so I always watch out the development in other countries. Currently, I'm doing sort of manual lymph drainage and some self massage, wearing a compression garment. I have recently been introduced to the use of Bioptron light (www.lymph.com.au/category4_1.h... They claim that the light can stimulate light-sensitive intracellular structures and moleculesm. This then initiates cellular chain reactions which in turn helps reduce the swelling. As it is quite expensive, I want to know more before hiring or buying one. I would welcome the views from those who have tried it. Many thanks ~ Tweety. Log in to post a reply",
