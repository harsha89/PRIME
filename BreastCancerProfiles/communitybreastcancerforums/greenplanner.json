I had my follow-up appointment on Monday (3/11) and it didn't go so well. They found suspicious microcalcifications and had me schedule a core biopsy. I couldn't see any form of a tumor on the images they showed me, just the tiny specks of microcalcifications. I also couldn't tell if they looked like they were clustered, or in a radial pattern, or really anything. I know that supposedly the odds are still good that I don't have cancer, but I feel really pessimistic about it. I'm trying to prepare myself for bad news, I guess. Anyway, no one gave me a BI-RADS score when I was there. Should I call and ask what it was? If it's a 4 I'll be slightly less worried, but if it's a five I'm not sure how I'll make it until the Biopsy. Also, I never spoke to a radiologist, only the nurse relaying the info to me. I have no idea what I was looking at on the films, and would like to ask the radiologist what he sees. Is it normal to not have your films explained to you at the time? Will I have a chance to talk to a doctor on the day of my biopsy, before it's done? (This will be on Monday). Sorry if this doesn't make any sense. I'm just really unhappy about all of this happening, and confused. ETA: The day all this happened I really didn't think I could have cancer because I thought cancer meant you had a tumor, and I didn't see any tumor, nor did anyone say anything. Could there be a tumor there that I couldn't see? They did an ultrasound and saw nothing. It's only after reading about DCIS and microcalcifications that I've come to understand that I could have cancer without having an actual tumor. Also; Cancer can suck it! Log in to post a reply",
