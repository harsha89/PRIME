The shock has actually been the worst bit. Time is needed to get one's head around it all. It took me nearly 2 weeks to get the anaesthetic out of the system - could not have gone back to work. sounds like being very fit (i'm not) is a great help. Now post lumpectomy /SNB pain in right arm is very depressing. Anyone recommend acupuncture? I don't want to be on pain meds all the time, but can't sleep without. Sorry to be depressing. I am meant to be in Africa working not here recovering!",

I thought it was the worst thing and docs were not very sympathetic! I took neurontin ( a nerve pain med) which helped some, no other pain med touched it. I've cut down on the neurontin now and am using lanacaine powder over the numb/burning bits ( arm pit and inner arm). It will get better. Give yourself time, and accept all the help that is offered. It is not a small thing to go through.",

We had cancer and it sucks but we are getting better! Now it's 6 weeks ago and some of the worst is over. Every day is a bit better. You will get there, hang in there. Are you having chemo?
