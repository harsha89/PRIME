My regular doctor said it was from worry about being diagnosed with cancer and that it would pass as soon as I had surgery. I really thought the surgeon would cancel but she didn't seem at all worried even though I was coughing a lot and completely hoarse. The day after the lumpectomy I was still coughing. I went to an ENT and she had a look at my sinuses and prescribed antibiotics. 2 weeks later my cough was gone. And I changed my regular doctor for someone who has a bit more sense (I hope). I remember that being sick did not help my anxiety. I worried more about the cough interfering with surgery than I did about the actual surgery. Sending you good wishes for a speedy recovery from your cold and from surgery. Hugs. ",

While you want to do everything 100% perfectly for your baby all the time - this is not always possible - and now is one of those times. Your baby may not like the formula for 3 days - but he will cope with it much better if you are calm. Given that this is a really tough time for you - try to be accepting of the things that you cannot change - and don't feel guilty that you should have done something different - I never kept frozen breast milk just in case. Also - your baby will be OK. This is not something that will stress him out forever or cause a major problem. Give him a snuggle and some kisses with the formula and all will be well. I don't mean to sound flippant - I perfectly understand your point of view - your stress and your sorrow - I just want to let you know that in 20 years time you will look back at this and remember every detail but your son wont remember it at all.

I found a lymphedema specialist (extra qualified physiotherapist) and after 4 sessions I felt like a new person physically and also psychologically. I highly recommend trying a few sessions unless there is an underlying medical reason not to. Also ask your RO about taking some NSAIDS. I remember taking some for about 2 weeks and that helped a bit before the lymphedema specialist. I must add that I did not have thickening or orange peel - just a swollen, heavy bruised feeling.

Thanks for your kind wishes - so far so good. I would suggest that you do a lot of reading on-line about fibroadenomas - from various sources - medical and possibly alternative medicine - and then find a breast surgeon (or gyno) who is familiar with them and can answer your questions about how to proceed in the future. Two factors that you might want to research are Vitamin D and Iodine. While I am not a great believer in Alternative Medicine I do believe that Vitamin D and Iodine play a big role in breast health. I have no idea how they relate to fibroadenomas - like I said I have no experience with that. My breasts were rather lumpy in my twenties and thirties. I got cancer in my late forties and in my case I am sure it is genetic - given my family history. Do please update us after your ultrasound. Best wishes Bounce    ",

If you are having frequent meltdowns try to get to speak to a therapist with cancer experience.  Obviously they are not going to solve your problems for you in a second but it really helps to understand what is going on in your own head and heart. I have been at the meltdown stage.  It was not fun. If you can get yourself a bit calmer speak with the RO as soon as possible to clarify and tell him you feel you were lied to and are concerned about the lymphedema. It is an issue for many women after radiation and is not something that should be overlooked by the RO. Do you feel that the lymphedema is worse since starting rads? The RO should be available to you to discuss any problems you are having. Don't worry about asking to see him or what he thinks - do what is right for you. Sometimes I found the radiation nurse more helpful.Sometimes I wished I had never spoken to her. I can't see your diagnosis and in any case I have no medical training so can't offer advise about stopping or continuing rads. I just think your concerns are valid.  Meditating before speaking to my RO helps me be more calm.  I decide on what questions I must have answers to and try not to leave until they have been answered.  Not easy for me by any means. Deep calming breathes. My brief therapy helped me a lot with how I deal with doctors. Gentle hugs",

Although I did not have pain it was not pleasant. Some women have a really bad time of it. I fully understand your feeling that you were put through a useless procedure - but as others have explained - had cancer been found - the treatment options may have been different. It is also hard to know if you can rely on what people are doing or not if you have a bad experience along the way. It kind of messes things up. If possible find a breast surgeon you can trust - someone who is happy to answer questions - and be guided by them on all future issues.",

Sure you have to wait for the MRI and the results - but you will know more about the general state of both breasts from an MRI. On the down side if the MRI does show something you will still have to do the biopsy.",

There is scientific research showing calendula oil is more helpful than most other products for preventing skin problems during radiation. I was happy with using Calendular oil. I still occasionally use it.   ",

Starting with a lumpectomy to diagnose cancer would mean additional surgery if cancer was discovered.  I am sorry that you are in the situation you find yourself in. It must be beyond frustrating. Perhaps a second opinion could shed some more light on the issues. ",
