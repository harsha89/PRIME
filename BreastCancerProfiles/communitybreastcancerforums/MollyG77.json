No lump, but a slightly enlarged breast and a dimple when I raise my arms. My mammo and ultrasound both came back negative as well, but my obgyn had me follow up with a breast surgeon. When I met with my breast surgeon he was concerned because he said my dimpling \"looked ominous\" even though he couldn't feel a lump. So he ordered an MRI which I have on Wednesday. I would definitely go see a breast surgeon. Even if your tests came back negative you still dont know whats causing the dimpling (which is what's driving me crazy...). I know I feel better knowing that I'm being seen by an expert who's just as determined to find the reason for the dimpling as I am! It's also given me some peace of mind, which is nice. :)",

You know your body the best, and if you don't feel comfortable with level of care you've received I don't think it's unreasonable to at least go see your obgyn about it. I think it's pretty normal to be worried about symptoms like these! I would do whatever makes you feel the most comfortable. :) CasM - I'm sorry you've had to go through all that... I'm still new to this whole thing, so I don't know much about cysts or how long dimples stay around, but I think those are definitely questions that are worth bringing up to your breast surgeon at your next appointment. Hopefully they can talk you through what the next step will be and which tests will be the most useful... So I had my MRI today! It's nice to finally have it done... I was hoping to get answers right after the test, but the radiologist had to compare my MRI results with my mammo and u/s images, so I couldn't get my results right away. But the MRI techs said the report would be sent to my breast surgeon's office by the end of the day, so I should be getting a call anytime now. It's strange knowing that my results are just sitting in my doctor's office right now... Its driving me a little crazy, but i think tomorrow I'm going to call the office to ask when I can get my results. Hopefully either the nurse or doctor can just pass them to me over the phone, it'd be nice to avoid yet another trip to the doctor's office... And if they're benign (fingers crossed!) we won't have to talk about much anyway! :D",
