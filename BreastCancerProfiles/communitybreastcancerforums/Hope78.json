I have a similar situation as yours being I was diagnosed with Stage 1 in September 2011. Now almost 6 years later I was diagnosed with Stage IV that has spread to the lungs (August 2017). I traveled down to MD Anderson and they are doing some genetic testing on me as well. They are also testing my tumor to see if I would be a candidate for a trial going on down there. I'm eager to find out more information and see where we go from here. In the meantime they did start me on Halaven. Hope you are getting some answers and doing well!",
