I have been out of work for over 2 months when my manager said I would loose my position if I stayed out threw out the course and i was running out of FMLA days, so, I went back to work.

I am drinking enough, eating enough and here I am still weak. Anyone who wants to make your own bracelets, go to the craft store and buy a clear cord called Stetch Magic, buy the 1mm (smaller tends to break) you can buy crystal or glass breads in the craft stores, also I always use a silver bead with a big hole for the end piece (to cover the knot) and the trick to the knot is to stretch the cord as you are tying and tie it in different directions tightly.\\ Now i want a lemon seed, DH just brought fresh peachesand watermelon , maybe a peach tree or watermelon tree(HAHA). I could not handle all this without all of your posts, God bless you all Lori",

I had a lumpectomy with SN biopsy- found 1/2 Lymph nodes+. ONC suggested bilat mastectomy but PS insisted that I have radical node dissection on right and SN biopsy on left, then I had a bilat. mastectomy with TE placed. I had the best sleep last night since i had the radical node dissection, I've had so much swelling I could not sleep on my side until last night and I am very much a side sleeper. :)",
