Just curious, Gloria",

Just returned from a repeat mammo with magnification on my left breast, due to \"clustered calcifications\".  I've been reading some messages and had no idea that calcifications could be next step to breast cancer.  I'll be awaiting the repeat mammo results with much anxiousness.  I was glad to hear that 80% of the women with this diagnosis are negative for cancer.  Can anyone point me to where I can get more info on \"clustered calcifications\".  Thanks for being here. Sincerely, Gloria",
