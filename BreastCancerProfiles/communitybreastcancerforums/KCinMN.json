Just a bit more and I think I can color. It's hard to tell, but it's not really gray or brown... Just ugly. I used to be blond. It's wavy, but it was wavy before... I can still see some scalp on top, just waiting for that to hurry and fill in.",

Doc called me this afternoon. She's been my physician for awhile. It was hard for her to tell me. She only knew that it is cancer though, no details. She's sending me in for an MRI next Mon or Tuesday when we can get it scheduled. And we'll go from there... Is the MRI after a biopsy pretty standard??? I'm 39! 2 kiddos.

Welcome to all the new ladies joining in! I had my Sim pushed a back a week later... They wanted to squeeze in another fill (tissue expanders) before I start. So that means I'll likely start my real treatments the week of Christmas (the 21st). Merry Christmas to me! Lol! As long as it does what it's supposed to do... Where does everyone go for their Rads? How far? I ask, only because I know some travel farther than others depending on where you live. And it's interesting to me, since we have to go daily! I have to drive about an hour each way. I'm in MN, and travel into Minneapolis. There are closer places to me, but not under my same network. Plus, I have to have treatment to midline and 'something else' (can't remember)which they don't always like to do at all places near me anyway... Plus, I like my Rad Onc a lot, so sticking with her... It wouldn't be so bad of a drive, except that we've hit WINTER and SNOW here. So it could make for an interesting 33 treatments.",

Just don't load up on any supplemental antioxidants. My RO wasn't overly concerned. I read an article once where some medical professionals were discussing whether or not antioxidants would 'protect' cancer cells from rads/chemo or whatever. I don't remember all of it, but it seemed like there was an argument over swapping out a handful of blueberries for a cookie. As if eating the junk was better, because those blueberries would protect the cancer. I think most of the contributors thought this was crazy and completely untrue. Personally, I think our food is often our medicine. So I'll lay off the supplements, but not the produce! :) That being said, all my healthy eating didn't keep me from getting cancer in the first place. Maybe I should try ice cream and Oreos before my next treatment! Haha, kidding! ",

But I exercise daily, and it's crazy cause the days where I do work out just a little more... I always feel better! And I go to bed early! :) Jabe - cute pic! Congrats to you and Octo on finishing. I know I'm probably missing someone and I apologize! I'm always encouraged by you ladies forging the way ahead of me! This thread is flying though; can't keep up! Love it! After today's treatment, just 10 more for me! Looking forward to being done!",
