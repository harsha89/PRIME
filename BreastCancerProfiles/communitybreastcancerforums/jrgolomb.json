Renrel--thanks for the info on the book.  Hi just spent two days with 19 teenagers and two adults at lake Michigan.   The highlight was an overnight in a wwii submarine.  It was quite an experience.  Because the ship was not full 5 veterans came and stayed there as well.  I was able to sleep in officer country and it was a hoot and some times tearful to hear their war stories.   Today I took the students on a dune hike and almost every single freshman student had never seen a beach before.  Though I am very tired this evening, this trip was worth it just to see the amazement on their face- the first time they saw this country's beautiful fresh water lake and the sand.  I made ALL of them at least take off their shoes and socks and walk in the sand ( there was a method to my madness:  a long trip home with teenager sweaty socks and shoes.....NO WAY, NO HOW!!!)  and them most of them waded around a bit.  We were under a bit of a time crunch and couldn't stay long, but it was a satisfying two hour trip home.  The kids were happy and looking forward to telling their friends about their trip, and I didn't have to open the window and take in self preservation survival gulps of fresh air!!!!!! Because I am still having trouble sleeping, my ob gyn gave me ambien.  Anyone know anything about this?",

Well in one week I get the famous blood test we love to hate to wait for.  Hopefully my blood counts are better.  I have more energy, but still have issues with dizziness and when the fatigue hits, I am down for the count.  I have also developed mouth sores and - you will all be proud of me- have NOT looked up the possible reasons why on the net.  I just hope that doesn't somehow connect with the weird blood counts.  Of course I could also attribute the sores to the intently hot salsa I have and seem to be gourging on whenever I am home after work.  Hm.......food for thought.  Wait a minute, is salsa food?  Actually, I made this most recent batch more like a chunky salsa.  I had 4 different peppers I used, plus fresh tomatoes and onions from our garden.  In fact, my little monologue here has inspired me to drag out another batch from the freezer.  Well, JJs, as usual you are all a godsend.  Thank you for checking in, responding and sharing.  I so wish someday we can all meet.  Have a great weekend.   Renrel---btw......dd will be in Boston in Feb----whadya think? ",

TRIP TO ANN ARBOR-- wouldn't you know there was a unexpected mini snow storm around the Ann Arbor area when I drove an activity 15 seat-er school bus with 13 teen-aged girls. In spite of that,  we made it on time, went to the back stage of a wonderful and beautiful theater on U of M college campus and talked to some sweet college students.  They enticed all 13 girls to try a few simple Irish dance steps.  Only one girls from my group volunteered at first( after I pushed her --gently!-- into  the middle). Somehow, in spite of their reticent actions, the complete group tried something new.  This is HUGE for my group of students.  I was/am ecstatic! The show was very well done.  Of course dd stood out during every dance!  The 'lil stinker arranged with the director to present a gift to me before the show started.  Of course when he said my name- I kind of tuned him out because I was helping the students read the program- then my loudest girl, shouted out my name and the rest of the students shoved me toward the stage.  It was a pleasant surprise and dd is still a 'lil stinker! I may have mentioned on earlier posts that parking is a premium in Ann Arbor and with the snow and no time to plow the roads, I was in a bit of a panic, because I wanted to get there early to find parking.     Snow was hitting the roads hard and there were several fender benders and cars in ditches.I did have  a back up plan to have dd follow me 1.5 miles to Crisler Arena- no basketball game- only tennis /and or go to a mall nearby and then he can take me back to the theater but the parking gods were on my side!  Fortunately through all of that, there were four parking spaces right in from the the theater.  We took them! ",

Next week I go to see the breast surgeon to press the issue of mast of the other \"disease\" free breast cause as I've been going on and on about before, I have  lcis and lobular cancer is notorious for showing up in the other breast as well.  I will still always have mris, because the mammo AND the ultrasound didn't pick up \"shinikies\".  (Can you tell I am around teens all day!!!??)

Of course it was the same time.  So, I get a scrambled message from dh and the nurse who is looking for me and I am an hour away at work so I mumble out a ditzed out lame excuse and  now I have to wait three more weeks.  So tonight I am searching around on the bc board and I come across some section about prognosis ....big mistake!!! What was I thinking?  I felt pretty darn good lately and was very hopeful- not waking up at night worrying, not pressing every new ache and pain and worrying- thinking the tamoxifen is being metabolized by me so the d^$^&$^ cancer will never come back and I read about recurrence and survivability and I shout to myself  Enough already!!!  Time to leave a nite nite message to January Jewels---Oh yeah, oh yeah....2010 has got to be better!!!!",

Can't remember them.   I had a wonderful time.  The weather held out; people didn't say too much about my terrifically short hair cut, only one person rubbed my head and a photographer-who had a booth to make tintype photos of people- took a picture of me.  He said he wanted to take advantage of my white hair and the silver tones!  I had mixed feelings about doing this, but I have to say I think I may not dye my hair anymore.  it is very white on the sides, darker on the top, and I kind of like it.   Guess what?  Tomorrow is my last day of Radiation????  I am happy and then I am afraid at the same time. btw, anybody having lots of hot flashes? If so, do you have any other symptoms?  Last Friday I had about 10 of them throughout the day and then about 5 at night.   Oh yeah, chemo brain.  Talk about getting disoriented at a festival.....that created a couple of anxiety induced sweats i tell you.

Anyway, it was great to talk. Hugs all.",

That irks me!  At any rate, my dog-well actually dd's - had quite a hey day with asserting her authority, don't ya know!  After a bit, the two get along just fine and I guess if no one claims her, I'll take her in!  The thing is, I am sure someone is missing her.  She is well behaved dog and so sweet. She sat when told and then stayed there!  (quite unlike the other one!) I will take a photo of her, print up a flyer or two, and post them- while taking care of her.  I'd hate to take her away from her home , if that is indeed the case.

I sort of thought it was a gradual thing, but I am guessing it will suddenly start falling.  I am off to get a really short hair cut-the 1/4 of an inch deal you have all mentioned.  At any rate, fall out-take a while to fall out- I am getting it cut short because it is one less thing I have to mess with. ",

The only chair I had to sit in yesterday was a group of people undergoing transfusions and blodd platelet infusions-They all had some sort of blood disorder and my gosh they were a wonderfully warm and funny bunch to be around. One woman was on her last tx and she felt so good she is planning a huge gathering and local trip with her family.  I hope all is well with everyone.  I am off to the center this afternoon to get my neulasta shot and then the rest of my scalp buzzed.  No more hair swoops to cover the bald!!!",

BKim--had my simulation.  Told the Doc to please make sure I don't have to much scar tissue, so I don't have to have a bunch more surgeries.  I felt so much better after talking to him.  He was very optimistic and said I would be okay.  He just couldn't live with himself if I turned down rads.  He heard about my second opinion and thought he would call me if I changed my mind about doing rads.  I feel better now, not happy about the potential scar tissue, but really NOT happy about the chance of recurrence.  sS there it is~~~ Lisalisa,  I have thought about such a place for my daughter to go to, but she's a 16 year old and acts so independent , it is hard to talk to her about my situation.  I will have to look into what they have for teens......

I have had the energy to vacation a bit and had a nice time camping with dd.  I read a couple of great books, and am plugging along with exercise and a well needed break.  I went to the beach, lathered up in sun screen over my radiated chest, put up an umbrella, and still managed toget sun burned.  I ate well at great vacation spots in the wonderful state of Michigan, drank a nice glass or two of red wine ( all Michigan) and sat around the fire and told old family stories to dd.  Needed that, need it again.  hugs all",

I also feel quite relieved after talking to my boss about the BIG C!  She was very supportive and has offerred a ton of ideas about how I can go through tx and still work.  She said I can come to work even if there is a sub and she will use the sub elsewhere, hence I don't have to use more sick days.  I am soooooo relieved. ",

But for some reason he went back into the room when I was around the corner with a group of students working in a computer lab.....I thought I had locked the door, but I have been getting mixed up with the simple task-I lock the door instead of unlocking it and vice versa.   The only way I found out he took the money was when one of my students went ahead to my room and said the particular student had just left my room.  If he had never told me that , the kid would have stolen my money and gotten away with it!   This is the kid who always wanted to pat me on the back and help me carry stuff!  Yeah, now I know why!  Kick the dog when it's down! Again, I feel so invaded, so hurt and so spacey..  I hate this chemo fog.  And gosh, I hope the chemo does its job.    Thanks for reading and responding.  I am amazed at my mood swings.  One minute I am happy because I am so close to being chemo done, the next minute full of dred because I feel recurrence and then I get binged by a thief!  Right now all I can do is rub my lunago white head and I have to admit I broke down and drank a FREAKING GLASS OF ROBERT MONDAVI 2007 MERLOT!!!!!!!!!  Hey lisalisa, what about NAPA VALLEY!!!!!!????????",

I am not stupid, or blind, or delusional;I just want to focus on living, on fighting, on searching for ways to find a cure for ALL of us.  My lord, YOU ALL KNow the fear , To me you are the only ones who understand what I mean.  BEVR---my last treatment day is Thursday!!!  Wooohoooooooo!!!!!! I start at 11am eastern time!   Renrel, Plutz and all ....my legs were really sore today and I just walked up and down stairs at work...Didn't run today cause of it.  Now I am three days out from exercise and I regret it.  Went home and ate instead.  Groan! HEY!?  Anyone considering going to Las Vegas in September??????There is a group gathering there . I believe Sept 25th.....IS that option for the January Jewels?????Gosh, we'd probably have hair!!!!!",

Speaking of teaching, I am excitedly planning an activity with 13 female high school students.  We are going to see my  dd dance at U of M!  She made it into an Irish dance troupe and will be performing the 5th of Feb.  I was able to get tickets for a reduced amount and since I can drive a bus, I am taking them down there.  I am a bit nervous about driving in the snowy weather, but I think I can do it.  Then of course I am VERY nervous about parking.  Anyone from a big city have that issue?  I have a cough and now a sore throat and of course I am trying not to \"go there\" with the worry. Sigh.  Plus, still having issues with weight gain.  Pants are getting tight now.  Yikes!",
