My husband wants to know if I have told our girls yet, and I refuse to worry them until I know what it is I am dealing with exactly.  My husbands mom has been through this twice and finaly on round two they took her breast so I have unfortunately seen how traumatic it can be, but I have also seen the postive happy results on being told your cancer free. I can only wait now to see what the BS says to me on Friday, and take it from there.",

I had breast augmentation to fill everything back out after breast feeding 4 kids and losing a lot of weight over the past 2 yrs back in January. I had never felt any lumps prior to May 28th ( at least nothing out of the norm ). I had my Mamm and US on June 14th  and everything came back ok on the Mamm but the US did not. I received a call on June 20th ( Happy B-Day to me ) that I had an area of mixed tissue and I needed to see a breast surgeon immediately.  I now have a hard copy of the report in my hands and the radiologist is calling it a heterogeneous lesion measuring 1.5 x 1.6 x 0.7 Cm , 3cm below the rigght nipple at the 5:00 position.  He is recommending a biopsy under US guidance.  My aunt had both her breasts removed back in the early 80's because of breast cancer but no one else has had issues. Ive never been so scared in my life, and unfortunately I feel like I am in this alone.  I cant sleep more than 4 hours a night rite now and then I have nightmares to top things off. My appt with the surgeon is July 8th. The Unknown is the worst part Log in to post a reply",
