For those who already have health insurance, this is still very important because each of us mbc patients needs to review our current health insurance plan for the following key coverage points, and quickly find a better health plan if our coverage falls short: 1) Are our doctors covered by our health insurance plan? 2) Are our drugs covered by our insurance plan? This should entail coverage for our current and potential future medications. Also, patients need to distinguish between chemo/medicine given orally, which falls under an insurer's formulary, and that given via IV, which doesn't. So patients may need to look into both. 3) Are our hospitals covered by our insurance plan? 4) Are our pharmacies covered by our insurance plan? The reason for posting this is that a very good friend in severe pain has discovered that her current coverage is falling short in each and every one of the above categories, each of which is critical in and of itself. We each must take personal responsibility to avoid unpleasant surprises, given the shrinking scope of coverage in the health insurance field.

      "Content": "Bestbird wrote: Although I'm still not \"back\" as yet, I thought that some of us may be interested in this thought-provoking research! This study challenges the historical paradigm of targeting fast-growing cells.  In addition to the concept of using chemo to kill fast growing cells, the article led me to wonder about the validity of targeting a particular mutation, unless that mutation can be linked to metastasis in the specific individual's tumor cells.  The article may help to explain the conundrum of why a given therapy works for one patient and not another - in one person, it's possible that the fast-growing cells may indeed be the culprits that drive a tumor's growth and metastasis, whereas in another person it may be another subset of (slower growing) tumor cells that are doing so. This is just a single study which by no means is conclusive.  That said, indeed it represents quite a paradigm shift. \"Of the many sub-groups of cells jockeying for supremacy within a cancerous tumor, the most dangerous may not be those that can proliferate the fastest, researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute report in a paper appearing in an advance online publication of the journal Nature... Doctors need to ascertain which cell subgroups are truly driving the tumor's growth and metastasis and select drugs that target the critical genes within those cells. It can be a mistake to assume that the largest, most dominant subgroup is the one to be targeted.\" \"It is well-established that individual tumors are genetically heterogeneous - comprised of multiple subgroups of cancer cells, each with its own genomic signature, or pattern of gene mutations,\" said the study's senior author, Kornelia Polyak, MD, PhD, of Dana-Farber. \"We wanted to explore the factors that allow these subgroups to coexist, and to understand why the subgroup with the greatest proliferative ability does not always take over the tumor.\" It has been long assumed that mutations that speed up the proliferation of cancer cells are also responsible for tumor growth. Indeed, when the growth of tumor cells is unchecked (as occurs in lab-grown tumor cells), the subgroup that proliferates fastest should outgrow other subgroups. In actual tumors, however, cell growth is constrained by limited access to environmental factors such as space, nutrients, and oxygen. As a result, tumors often grow much slower than they would under laboratory conditions. The presence of fast-growing cells does not necessarily cause tumors to enlarge, because their fast growth rates are offset by higher rates of cell death. If a subgroup of cancer cells \"figures out\" how to change the tumor environment so some of the restraints on tumor growth are removed, that subgroup may have a competitive advantage over other subgroups within the tumor... The investigators then ran a series of tests in which they implanted in mice a single subgroup plus the original cell sample or a mix of several subgroups and observed the growth of the resulting tumors. They found that two of the sub-groups - one overproducing a protein called CCL5, the other overproducing a protein called IL11 - were able to drive tumor growth... \"Surprisingly, there was no link between a subgroup's ability to drive tumor growth and its competitive expansion within the tumor...\" Investigators found that when multiple subgroups were present in the same tumor, they interfered with each other's expansion. This suggests that once heterogeneity arises within a tumor, it tends to persist, as it becomes difficult for a single subgroup to take over the tumor, the study authors state. Such co-existence allows interactions between the various subgroups to take place. Indeed, investigators found that when multiple subgroups are present in the same tumors, the tumors grow faster and also become metastatic, which hasn't been observed in tumors composed of any single subgroup. \"The goal of precision therapy for cancer is to kill the subsets of cells that are driving the tumor's growth - even if other subsets are proliferating more robustly,\" Polyak explained. Targeting the fast-proliferating subsets could actually be harmful, she continued: by removing a competitor, such drugs could assist the growth-driving subsets, thereby enhancing growth of the overall tumor. \"We need to be sure we're targeting the actual drivers.\" From: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/280404.php Dx 10/6/2011, IDC, Left, Stage IV, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "May 7, 2013 04:21PM Bestbird wrote: Yes, it has been done, allegedly sometimes with good results.  I know of one woman who said that when cancer spread to the liver, the Dr. wanted to try this one last thing before chemo to see if the cancer could be tricked WITH estrogen (I believe she used Estradiol). After 2 mos., the CT scan showed stable with even maybe a tiny shrinkage in tumors throughout the liver and TMs from 100 to 85. First drop in years.  She took estrogen pills 3 times a day and it is pretty tolerable except for bleeding..  Below is a set of study excerpts: Reintroducing Estrogen after AI Therapy Lonning and colleagues (22) studied the efficacy of high dose of DES on the responsiveness of metastatic breast cancer following exhaustive treatment with antihormone therapies (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, etcetera). A remarkable 4 of 32 patients had complete responses (22), and 1 patient, who was treated for 5 years, had no recurrence of her disease 6 years after stopping DES (23). The question, however, is whether physiologic estrogen has efficacy as an antitumor agent in the appropriately prepared estrogen-deprived breast tumor. Ellis and colleagues (24) addressed this question and found an equivalent clinical benefit for high (30 mg daily) and low (6 mg daily) dose of estradiol in metastatic breast cancer patients who had failed aromatase inhibitor therapy, that is, long-term estrogen deprivation. Their clinical advance was that low-dose estrogen was as efficacious as high-dose estrogen for antitumor therapy in breast cancer (for the appropriate tumor that had been estrogen deprived), but there were fewer side effects with low-dose therapy. The target, estrogen-deprived breast cancer, is vulnerable to physiologic estrogen. When estrogen-lowering drugs no longer control metastatic breast cancer, the opposite strategy might work. Raising estrogen levels benefited 30 percent of women whose metastatic breast cancer no longer responded to standard anti-estrogen treatment, according to research conducted at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and collaborating institutions.  The results are reported in the Aug. 19, 2009, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Not only did estrogen treatment often stop disease progression, in some patients metastatic tumors became resensitized and again responded to anti-estrogen treatments. \"The women in the study had all experienced a relapse while on estrogen-lowering drugs, and their disease was progressing,\" says lead author Matthew J. Ellis, M.D., Ph.D., an oncologist with the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University and Barnes-Jewish Hospital. \"So they were faced with undergoing chemotherapy. We found that estrogen treatment stopped disease progression in many patients and was much better tolerated than chemotherapy would have been.\" Sixty-six postmenopausal women with breast cancer that had spread beyond the breast participated in the study. All participants were originally diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER ) breast tumors, meaning estrogen stimulated tumor growth. All participants had received aromatase inhibitor treatment, which severely lowers estrogen levels, but their metastatic tumors had later reappeared or resumed growing. The study compared a high 30-milligram daily dose of estrogen to a low 6-milligram daily dose, and evaluated how well the treatments controlled the women's metastatic cancers and how the treatments affected their quality of life. The high dose results in estrogen levels in the blood comparable to that of pregnant women, while the low dose gives estrogen levels similar to that of women who are ovulating, Ellis indicates. In both the high- and low-dose groups about 30 percent of participants experienced a clinical benefit \u2014 their tumors either shrank or stopped growing. Interestingly, the researchers demonstrated that they could predict fairly accurately which patients would have this positive response. They conducted standard positron emission tomography (PET) scans before estrogen treatment and 24 hours later. If metastatic tumors flared, or glowed more brightly, in the PET scans after estrogen was started, they were much more likely to be affected by estrogen therapy. In 80 percent of women with PET flare reactions, tumors responded to estrogen therapy, and in 87 percent of women without PET flares, tumors did not respond to estrogen. The participants filled out questionnaires to indicate whether they had adverse reactions to estrogen during the study. Adverse reactions could include headaches, bloating, breast tenderness, fluid retention, nausea and vomiting. Patients receiving the high estrogen dose had more severe side effects. \"The older women in the study were, the fewer estrogen-related symptoms they had,\" says Ellis also professor of medicine in the Division of Oncology. \"But overall, we demonstrated clearly that the low dose was better tolerated than the high dose and was just as effective for controlling metastatic disease.\" In the 30 percent of participants who responded to estrogen, tumors often began to grow again after a period of months or years. But in a third of these recurring cases, the researchers showed that the women's tumors had become resensitized to anti-estrogen therapy.

The trial pairs IBRANCE (Palbociclib) with Bazedoxifene, an anti-osteoporosis drug currently used in Europe. Bazedoxifene is a pill that belongs to a class of drugs known as specific estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). These drugs are distinguished by their ability to behave like estrogen in some tissues, while significantly blocking estrogen action in other tissues. Bazedoxifene also has some of the properties of a newer group of drugs, known as selective estrogen receptor degraders SERDs (of which Faslodex is one), which can target the estrogen receptor for destruction. Because bazedoxifene has already undergone safety and efficacy studies as a treatment for osteoporosis, it may be a safe and viable option for patients with advanced breast cancer whose tumors have become resistant to other treatment options.

My understanding of PFS is that the disease has not become worse. Hence it is considered stable or receding, and it's also possible that the patient becomes NED. Extending PFS is certainly nothing to be sneezed at, especially for symptomatic patients and/or patients experiencing pain. But OS is also considerably important. Why would OS not also be significantly extended along with PFS? Possibly drug toxicity adversely impacted the patient over time, and/or the cancer became unusually aggressive towards the end. I've directed the question to an expert to see what she has to say!",

I have 2 overall thoughts that I'm hoping people might weigh in on: 1) Perhaps it would be more efficacious to cycle through a set of therapies in a continuous loop before any single therapy fails. As we're aware, the current conventional strategy entails trying one therapy, failing it, then trying another, failing that, and so forth until the list is exhausted. Alternatively, cycling through a given set of therapies and then starting all over again in a continuous loop might keep the cancer totally confused and not provide it with the opportunity to develop the resistance and escape mechanisms it's infamous for. 2) Since bc/mbc is a heterogeneous disease and it is possible that some parts of the tumor (or tumors in other parts of the body) have a different hormonal and/or HER2 profile than the biopsied section, what is the harm in starting everyone on hormonal therapy unless they are significantly ill from the disease (in which case chemo would be called for because it is faster-acting). Perhaps the same should apply to Herceptin for HER2- at some point. Again, just musing!",

First, we don't have the mature results of the palbociclib trials, so we are lacking OS data. Nothing can be said about this drug so far regarding whether it extends survival. I'd have to check, but I think the same is still true about the Afinitor Phase III trials. Phase II trials should be ignored, IMO, because they aren't sufficiently powered for this endpoint. Second, this is particularly problematic for first line trials in hormone-sensitive MBC, because of the confounding effect of all the subsequent treatments. MDAnderson biostatistician Don Berry did an interesting statistical paper on this phenomena several years ago that made the case that the longer the survival postprogression, the less likely an OS benefit could ever be shown, even if there was one. I'm attaching this paper, which is called, \"Detecting an Overall Survival Benefit that Is Derived From Progression-Free Survival\" Note: Musa's attachment is a long and very challenging paper to read. There is an excerpt that I'm still trying to fully comprehend at: http://www.pubfacts.com/detail/19903805/Detecting-.... The excerpt states, \"Addressing Survival Post Progression (SPP) is important in understanding treatment effects. For clinical trials with a PFS benefit, lack of statistical significance in OS does not imply lack of improvement in OS, especially for diseases with long median SPP. Although there may be no treatment effect on SPP, its variability so dilutes the OS comparison that statistical significance is likely lost. OS is a reasonable primary endpoint when median SPP is short but is too high a bar when median SPP is long, such as longer than 12 months.\"",

I wish I had the time and energy to go through all the trials and sort them by TNBC, Her2+-, etc. so that all mbc groups would be able to have their own set of information for ease of reference.   I've recently been battling some back and arm pain which have limited my time on the computer. Of all the trials, I find the last one, GL-ONC1, the most intriguing.  It's virus-based and after reading about the therapy, I'm totally wow-ed!  To my layperson's mind this is the stuff that dreams are made of!  However, MSK appears to be accepting patients solely with malignant pleural effusion.  That wouldn't rule out contacting the company (which is provided in the above list) for further info. I'll be keeping GL-ONC1 on my radar screen, along with several other promising therapies including\"CD47\"  in 2014.  Also, for what it's worth, I suspect that in the future that androgen testing and therapy, which is currently in clinical trial, will one day become as commonplace as ER and Her2.  Thank you, Crystal Ball! Heidihill, the last link was for something that had been posted here earlier that I want to keep an eye on.  It sounds too good to be true, but it was in my notes nevertheless.  Good catch!  ",

The source (unless otherwise noted) for the trials below is at the following link.  Updates are being made constantly; however, the list provided by the link is quite long and it takes quite a while to review them all, which is why I culled through them and posted them here. https://www.breastcancertrials.org/bct_nation/browse_trials.seam?categoryString=METASTATIC&pageRecord=0 If you are interested in a particular clinical trial below, you can copy the code for the trial (ie. MCC-16025) and look it up in your browser. 1-MT with Vaccine Therapy for Metastatic Breast Cancer A Phase 1/2 Study of Ad.p53 DC Vaccine in Combination With 1-Methyl-D-tryptophan in Metastatic Invasive Breast Cancer (MCC-16025) Summary Researchers are trying to identify new therapies that will be effective in patients with metastatic breast cancer. One treatment they are studying is an experimental vaccine called Ad.p53 DC (a dendritic cell-based p53 vaccine). The vaccine works by getting the immune system to go after and kill cancer cells. Another treatment being studied is a biological therapy called 1-methyl-D-tryptophan (1-MT). This therapy works by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by stimulating the immune system. The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety and effectiveness of 1-MT when it is given in combination with the Ad.p53 DC vaccine. The researchers will also look at whether 1-MT can help patients mount a better immune response to the Ad.p53 DC vaccine. This is a Phase I-II trial PM01183 for Metastatic Breast Cancer A Multicenter Phase II Clinical Trial of PM01183 in BRCA 1/2-Associated or Unselected Metastatic Breast Cancer (PM1183-B-003-11) Summary Researchers are studying new drugs that may be effective in treating metastatic breast cancer. Laboratory studies suggest that PM01183, a drug that promotes cancer cell death by binding to specific pieces of DNA, may be an effective cancer therapy. This study is looking at whether PM01183 is effective in women with metastatic breast cancer, and whether women who carry a BRCA 1/2 genetic mutation are more likely to respond to this drug. To be eligible for \"Group A\", a patient must have a known BRCA 1/2 mutation. Patients who do not have a BRCA1/2 mutation may be eligible for \"Group B.\" This is a Phase II trial Naltrexone for Metastases Not Responding to Hormone Therapy Phase II Study of Naltrexone for the Treatment of Hormone-Refractory, Metastatic Breast Cancer (2006LS016) Summary Breast cancer tumors that are estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) may eventually stop responding to all of the currently available hormone therapies. Naltrexone (Revia®) is a drug that is currently used to treat alcohol and drug dependence. Studies have shown that a low dose of the drug is able to block the use of estrogen by cancer cells, which suggests it might also be an effective treatment for ER+ breast cancer. It may also work by impairing blood flow to the tumor. This goal of this trial is to study the safety and effectiveness of naltrexone in women with ER+ metastatic breast cancer that has stopped responding to hormone therapy. This is a Phase II trial Estradiol and Aromasin® for Hormone Therapy-Resistant Disease A Pilot Study Of Estradiol Followed By Exemestane For Post-Menopausal Hormone Receptor Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer After Prior Failed Endocrine Therapy: Reversing Endocrine Resistance (10-0906-04) Summary Over time, hormone-sensitive tumors can stop responding to anti-estrogen treatments such as aromatase inhibitors (AI). Estradiol is a type of estrogen produced in the body. Laboratory studies have found that estradiol stops acting like an estrogen after resistance to an AI has developed. Instead it kills cancer cells that have become resistant to the AI. It also gets the tumor to start responding again to an AI. This pilot study is investigating the effectiveness of estradiol followed by the AI exemestane (Aromasin®) in postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer that has stopped responding to an AI. Velcade® & Faslodex® for Advanced Disease A Randomized Phase II Study of Fulvestrant vs. Fulvestrant in Combination With Bortezomib in Women With ER Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer (CDR0000674542) Summary Hormone therapies are used to treat hormone-sensitive (ER+, PR+) tumors. Fulvestrant (Faslodex®) is an estrogen receptor antagonist that is currently used to treat postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer that has advanced on other hormone therapies. Bortezomib (Velcade®) is a drug used to treat certain blood cell cancers. It causes cell death by blocking enzymes (proteosomes) required for cell growth. Laboratory studies have shown that Velcade may increase the effectiveness of Faslodex. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of Faslodex combined with Velcade in treating postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic disease. To be eligible for this study, women must have a tumor that has stopped responding to an aromatase inhibitor (anastrazole, letrozole, or exemestane) and/or disease progression after one or more aromatase inhibitor for advanced disease. This is a Phase II trial BKM120 & Fulvestrant in Advanced ER or PR+, HER2- Tumors A Phase III Randomized, Double Blind Placebo Controlled Study of BKM120 With Fulvestrant, in Postmenopausal Women With Hormone Receptor-positive HER2-negative Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer Which Progressed ... (CBKM120F2302) Summary Researchers are trying to develop new drugs that will be effective in advanced hormone-sensitive (ER and/or PR+) tumors that have stopped responding to an aromatase inhibitor. BKM120 is an investigational biological therapy that works by blocking PI3K, a group of proteins that help cancer cells to grow. Fulvestrant (Faslodex®) is used to treat advanced hormone-sensitive breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose tumors have stopped responding to other anti-estrogen therapies. This study is investigating the safety and effectiveness of adding daily BKM120 to Faslodex in patients with hormone sensitive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer that has stopped responding to an aromatase inhibitor. This is a Phase III trial For TNBC: Erlotinib and Metformin in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Phase I Study of Erlotinib and Metformin in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (AAAF3743) Summary Researchers are trying to develop new therapies for triple negative (ER-, PR-, and HER2-negative) breast cancer. Metformin, a drug that lowers insulin, is commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes. Studies suggests it might also be an effective breast cancer treatment. Erlotinib (Tarceva®) is a kinase inhibitor that was initially approved for the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer. Laboratory studies suggest that metformin and erlotinib have the potential to be an effective combination for treating triple negative breast tumors. The goals of this study are to establish the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of erlotinib and metformin and to determine if the combination is effective in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer. This is a Phase I trial ARN-810 in Postmenopausal Women With Advanced Breast Cancer An Open-Label, Phase I Study of ARN-810 in Postmenopausal Women With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Estrogen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer (ARN-810-001) Summary Over time, hormone-sensitive tumors can stop responding to hormone therapies. ARN-810 is a new type of anti-estrogen drug called a selective estrogen receptor degrader. It is designed to block and destroy the hormone receptors that drive tumor growth. Laboratory studies suggest it may be effective in women who have stopped responding to other hormonal therapies. This study is looking at the safety and the most effective dose of ARN-810 for treating postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic hormone-sensitive, HER2-negative breast cancer who have already tried previous hormone therapies. This is a Phase I trial Neratinib For HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer A Phase II Study of Neratinib in Metastatic HER2 Non-amplified But HER2 Mutant Breast Cancer (201209135) Summary About 25 percent of women with breast cancer have tumors that have a genetic mutation that causes the cancer cells to have too many copies of the HER2 gene and too many HER2 receptors. These tumors are called HER2-positive, and they can be treated with the anti-HER2 targeted therapies Herceptin and Tykerb. Scientists recently discovered that some HER2-negative tumors have other types of HER2 genetic mutations that might make them respond to anti-HER2 targeted therapies. Neratinib is a new targeted therapy being developed to treat HER2-positive tumors. Researchers think it may also be effective in women whose tumors are HER2-negative but have these newly discovered HER2 mutations. The purpose of this study is to evaluate Neratinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors are HER2-negative but have these HER2 mutations. Patients who meet the entry criteria for this study will have their tumor tested for HER2 mutations. Only those who are found to have a HER2 mutation will be able to take part in the study. This is a Phase II trial Panobinostat and Letrozole for Metastatic Disease Panobinostat and Letrozole in Treating Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer (NCCTG-N093B) Summary Researchers are trying to identify new therapies that will be effective for women with metastatic disease. Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are proteins that play a role in the cell cycle and that are needed for cancer cell growth. Panobinostat is an investigational drug that may stop tumor growth by inhibiting the HDAC proteins. Letrozole (Femara®) is a type of hormone therapy called an aromatase inhibitor. It is regularly used to treat early-stage and metastatic hormone-sensitive breast cancer. The goal of this trial is to determine whether giving panobinostat together with letrozole is an effective treatment for individuals with metastatic hormone-sensitive breast cancer. This is a Phase I-II trial Lapatinib for HER2-Negative Metastatic Disease Phase II Trial of Lapatinib (Tykerb) in Women With Hormone Receptor Positive (ER and/or PR +) HER-2 Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Failed Prior Antihormone Therapy (11495) Summary Researchers are trying to find new treatments for hormone-sensitive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Lapatinib (Tykerb®) is a drug that targets a variety of protein enzymes involved in tumor cell growth. It is currently used to treat individuals with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. The goal of this trial is to see if lapatinib is effective in treating HER2-negative, hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer that has stopped responding to hormone therapy. This is a Phase II trial Pazopanib to Reverse Resistance to Hormone Therapy Reversing Hormone Resistance in Advanced Breast Cancer With Pazopanib (117513) Summary Anti-estrogen therapies are used to treat breast tumors that are hormone sensitive. Over time, some tumors will stop responding to these treatments. Researchers are looking for ways to get a breast tumor that has stopped responding to hormone therapy to start responding again to this treatment. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib (Votrient®) is currently used to treat kidney cancer. It works by interfering with cell communication and growth. Studies suggest it may also be able to get hormone-sensitive tumors to begin responding again to anti-estrogen therapies. The goal of this trial is to investigate the effectiveness of giving pazopanib to individuals whose cancer has progressed while on letrozole (Femara®) or anastrozole (Arimidex®). This is a Phase II trial Dovitinib Plus an Aromatase Inhibitor for Metastatic Disease A Phase I/II Trial of TKI258 (Dovitinib) in Combination With an Aromatase Inhibitor in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer (LCCC 2010-535) Summary Over time, hormone-sensitive tumors can stop responding to an aromatase inhibitor (AI). Dovitinib (TKI258) is a new targeted therapy that works by blocking the tyrosine kinase receptor on cancer cells. This receptor is like an on/off switch for many cell functions, and blocking it can keep cancer cells from getting the messages they need to grow and divide. This trial is investigating the effectiveness of and side effects associated with using dovitinib along with one of the AIs\u2014anastrozole (Arimidex®), letrozole (Femara®) or exemestane (Aromasin®). To be eligible, a woman must have already been on an AI to treat her metastatic breast cancer. This is a Phase I-II trial LFA102 for Prolactin-Receptor Positive Metastatic Disease A Phase I, Multicenter, Open-label Study of LFA102 Administered Intravenously in Patients With Prolactin Receptor-positive Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer or Prolactin Receptor-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer (CLFA102X2102) Summary Scientists are trying to develop new targeted therapies that will be effective against specific types of breast tumors. Studies have shown that many breast cancer cells have a prolactin receptor on their surface. When the hormone prolactin binds to the prolactin receptor, it can cause the cancer cell to grow and replicate. LFA102 is an antibody drug that targets the prolactin receptor. The goal of this trial is to determine the safety and effectiveness of LFA102 when it is given to individuals with metastatic disease. To be eligible, participants must have tumors that are prolactin-receptor positive. This is a Phase I trial Mammaglobin-A DNA Vaccine for Metastatic Breast Cancer A Phase I Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Mammaglobin-A DNA Vaccine in Breast Cancer Patients With Metastatic Disease (06-0298) Summary Researchers are trying to find more effective treatments for metastatic breast cancer. Mammaglobin-A is a protein that is found in 80 percent of breast tumors. Scientists think that a vaccine that contains mammaglobin-A DNA may get the body to generate an immune response to and go after and kill breast cancer cells. The overall goal of this trial is to study the safety of a vaccine that contains mammaglobin-A DNA in individuals with metastatic breast cancer. To be eligible, participants must have had stable disease for at least 30 days. This is a Phase I trial FANG Vaccine For Advanced Breast Cancer Phase I Trial of Bi-shRNAfurin and GMCSF Augmented Autologous Tumor Cell Vaccine for Advanced Cancer (CL-PTL 101) Summary Studies suggest that vaccines that enable the body to build an immune response to tumor cells might be effective and have few side effects. The FANG (bi-shRNAfurin and GMCSF autologous tumor cell) vaccine works by stimulating tumor surface proteins, which then increases the number of immune cells that attack breast cancer cells with these proteins. The goal of this trial is to study the safety of and tumor response to the FANG vaccine in individuals with advanced breast cancer who have no acceptable form of standard therapy. This is a Phase I trial Vaccine With Basilixumab for Metastatic Breast Cancer A Study of hTERT/Survivin Multi-Peptide Vaccination With Basiliximab And Prevnar For Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer (UPCC 03111) Summary Researchers believe that vaccines may be effective cancer treatments. Recent observations support the idea that the enzyme telomerase is essential for the formation of human tumors. In a recent study, three-quarters of breast tumors tested positive for human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Researchers believe that a vaccine that teaches the immune system to target hTERT may be an effective breast cancer treatment. This study is testing a hTERT/survivin/CMV multipeptide vaccine in women with metastatic breast cancer. The vaccine is given along with the monoclonal antibody basiliximab, GM-CSF and Prevnar, which each work in different ways to help the immune system target the cancer cells. Enzalutamide For Treating Metastatic Breast Cancer A Phase 1 Open-Label, Dose Escalation Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of MDV3100 in Patients With Incurable Breast Cancer (MDV3100-08) Summary Many breast cancers depend on the hormones estrogen and/or progesterone to grow and spread. Research suggests that the androgen receptor (AR) is an additional hormonal target in many breast cancers. Blocking androgen from getting into AR+ breast tumors may slow or stop tumor growth. Enzalutamide is an experimental drug that can keep androgen from getting into cancer cells. Studies using the drug to treat prostate cancer have shown promising results. In the laboratory, it can also slow breast cancer cell growth. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic breast cancer that cannot be treated with other drugs. This is a Phase I trial. Naltrexone for Metastases Not Responding to Hormone Therapy Phase II Study of Naltrexone for the Treatment of Hormone-Refractory, Metastatic Breast Cancer (2006LS016) Summary Breast cancer tumors that are estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) may eventually stop responding to all of the currently available hormone therapies. Naltrexone (Revia®) is a drug that is currently used to treat alcohol and drug dependence. Studies have shown that a low dose of the drug is able to block the use of estrogen by cancer cells, which suggests it might also be an effective treatment for ER+ breast cancer. It may also work by impairing blood flow to the tumor. This goal of this trial is to study the safety and effectiveness of naltrexone in women with ER+ metastatic breast cancer that has stopped responding to hormone therapy. This is a Phase II trial Estradiol and Aromasin® for Hormone Therapy-Resistant Disease A Pilot Study Of Estradiol Followed By Exemestane For Post-Menopausal Hormone Receptor Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer After Prior Failed Endocrine Therapy: Reversing Endocrine Resistance (10-0906-04) Summary Over time, hormone-sensitive tumors can stop responding to anti-estrogen treatments such as aromatase inhibitors (AI). Estradiol is a type of estrogen produced in the body. Laboratory studies have found that estradiol stops acting like an estrogen after resistance to an AI has developed. Instead it kills cancer cells that have become resistant to the AI. It also gets the tumor to start responding again to an AI. This pilot study is investigating the effectiveness of estradiol followed by the AI exemestane (Aromasin®) in postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer that has stopped responding to an AI. Endoxifen for Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer Z-Endoxifen Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Locally Recurrent Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer (MAYO-MC093C) Summary The anti-estrogen drug tamoxifen fights breast cancer by keeping estrogen from getting into the tumor's cells. Before tamoxifen can begin working inside the body, it must be turned into a chemical called endoxifen by a protein in the liver called CYP2D6. Researchers believe that endoxifen may be an effective therapy for women who do not produce enough CYP2D6 to convert tamoxifen into endoxifen. The goal of this study is determine the best dose, effectiveness, and side effects of endoxifen when it is given to women with locally recurrent or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. This is a Phase I trial CDK-Inhibitor for Previously Treated Metastatic Disease Phase II Trial of the Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor PD 0332991 in Patients With Cancer (UPCC 03909) Summary A new target for treating metastatic breast cancer may be cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), a family of enzymes involved in cell growth. As the name implies, CDK enzymes are only active in the presence of proteins referred to as cyclins. PD 0332991 (Palbociclib) is a new biological therapy that blocks two different cyclin-dependent kinase enzymes. This, in turn, may slow or stop a cancer's growth. The goal of this trial is to determine the side effects of Palbociclib and how well it works in treating patients with tumors that are no longer responding to standard treatment. This is a Phase II trial A Phase I Study of LY2835219 For Advanced Cancer A Phase 1 Study of a CDK 4/6 Dual Inhibitor in Patients With Advanced Cancer (13199) Summary Cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) proteins are enzymes that help control cell growth. Laboratory studies have found that these enzymes often don't work properly in cancer cells, which can help fuel tumor growth. Scientists are investigating whether drugs that block the cdk enzymes may be effective cancer treatments. The experimental drug LY2835219 works by inhibiting two different cdk enzymes, cdk4 and cdk6. The goal of this trial is to determine the safety, best dose, and effectiveness of LY2835219 in individuals with advanced breast cancer. This is a Phase I trial GL-ONC1 http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01766739 How does GL-ONC1 work? The virus, which was used in the first smallpox vaccine two centuries ago, is delivered intravenously, then navigates through the body\u2019s immune response to reach its target. It smartly locates and kills all cancer cells throughout the body (solid tumors, liquid tumors, cancer stem cells and metastasis). The virus has also been genetically engineered to emit light, so the progress of the therapy can be tracked. And again, it does not harm healthy cells. When the virus enters the cancer cell, it begins to replicate rapidly and infects the cell, lighting up like a Christmas tree in the process, and letting the clinician know that cancer cells are being destroyed wholesale. When the body is cleared of all cancer cells, the lights go out and the cell debris as well as the virus are cleared from the body. There are virtually no side effects other than very mild fever and chills for several hours, at most. And the therapy works rapidly, sometimes as fast as a few weeks, and I've not found a situation in my extensive research of this company in which, when a therapeutic dose is given, it doesn't work - even on stage IV cancers.

I heartily \"second\" Jennifer's recommendation to obtain a biopsy of the mets. In addition to systemic therapy, there are also many liver-directed therapies (below0 to consider. Wishing you a great outcome, whatever you decide!  Liver metastasis is commonly treated with chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy.  Other potential treatments include but are not limited to: Ablation an open surgical procedure by a surgeon who specializes in oncology. Ablation therapy consists of heating or cooling the liver tissue, or uses intense electric pulses, to achieve cancer cell death. A special probe is used to access the tumor and each specific method of treatment is delivered by the probe. Ablation is safe and is well tolerated. It is an effective treatment for patients with inoperable metastatic tumors but is limited by the size and number of tumors present.Ablation mechanisms include: Cryotherapy, NanoKnife, and Radio Frequency Ablation. Cryotherapyalso called cryosurgery, cryoablation, or targeted cryoablation therapy, uses the application of extreme cold to destroy the liver tumor. NanoKnife works by applying electrical energy directly into tumors and opening cell walls of the tumor. The cancer cells die; and the healthy tissue remains unharmed.  RadioFrequency Ablation:Pulses of radiofrequency energy are sent through a catheter (a long, thin tube) to heat and destroy diseased tissue. Currently, RFA is a standard treatment for patients with inoperable liver tumors.RFA may be used with other interventional cancer therapies, such as chemoembolization. Hepatic Arterial Infusion (\u201cHAI\u201d) Chemotherapy: HAI involves a drug delivery system that is implanted under the skin. A catheter from the pump is connected to the gastroduodenal artery, which joins the hepatic arteries, allowing the pump to infuse only the liver with chemotherapy. Radioembolization or SIRT Yttrium 90 Microspheres: SIRT is a relatively new treatment suitable for use even in patients with extensive liver involvement. Radioactive spheres (SIR-Spheres or Therasphere) are injected into an artery in the liver. The spheres are very tiny radioactive seeds. After they are injected through the liver artery, they travel into smaller arteries that feed the tumor. Once \"the little magic beads\" are in the tumor, they give off radiation for about three days. The radioactivity causes damage to cancer cells with little damage to the healthy liver tissue.  Note: Those who undergo SIRT should consider going on Xeloda since some studies show that Xeloda works very well with the Y90 and it is a double punching power. The Xeloda allegedly kick starts the radiation beats into overdrive. And Y-90 is a minimally invasive treatment that delivers cancer-killing radiation directly to tumors shows promise in treating breast cancer that has spread to the liver when no other treatment options remain. The outpatient treatment, called yttrium-90 (Y-90) radioembolization, was safe and provided disease stabilization in 98.5 percent of the women's treated liver tumors in a recent study.  From: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140324133234.htm Transarterial Chemoembolization (\u201cTACE\u201d): Chemoembolization is also known as TACE. In this technique an interventional radiologist injects a chemotherapeutic agent directly into the arteries supplying the tumors within the liver.

(Thanks to Stephanie at bcmets for her original post on this).  \"Fatal AEs Higher with mTOR Drugs in Cancer\" By Charles Bankhead, Staff Writer, MedPage Today Published: February 17, 2013 This study was published as an abstract and presented at a conference. These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Fatal adverse events occurred more than twice as often in cancer patients treated with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors compared with control therapies. Point out that the most commonly identified cause of death was sepsis/infection. ORLANDO -- Fatal adverse events occurred more than twice as often in cancer patients treated with mTOR inhibitors compared with control therapies, a review of multiple clinical trials showed. Altogether, the trials showed a 3.4% incidence of treatment-emergent deaths among patients randomized to everolimus (Afinitor) or temsirolimus (Torisel). Control groups had a cumulative fatal event rate of about 1%, which is consistent with results from other types of clinical trials, Toni Choueiri, MD, said here at the Genitourinary Cancers Symposium. \"Use of mTOR inhibitors is associated with a small, but significant increased risk of developing a fatal adverse event,\" said Choueiri, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. \"I do want to emphasize that both study drugs, everolimus and temsirolimus, benefit the overall patient population with their approved indications, including renal-cell carcinoma (RCC).\" \"The risks associated with these drugs may be greater once they are introduced [more widely] to the real-world oncology population.\" he added. continued at: http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/MGUCS/37404 Dx 10/6/2011, IDC, Left, Stage IV, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Bestbird wrote: Having spent a week at the 2015 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), I wanted to share some observations and information with those living with metastatic breast cancer (mbc). My viewpoint will likely differ from others who attended, which is to be expected. Each participant gleans what is most important to them, and my intent at the conference was specifically to obtain new information that might help those who are dealing with mbc. The information I'm about to share has been vetted online after the conference, and much of it has been incorporated in my booklet entitled \"The Insider's Guide to Metastatic Breast Cancer.\" All parties interested in requesting a complimentary copy are invited to visit the top of page: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/831507?page=2#idx_32 Those who are interested solely in treatment-related information are welcome to skip the Overview and Assessment section below. OVERVIEW AND ASSESSMENT SABCS is a 5 day event that attracts researchers, physicians, scientists, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, patients and advocates worldwide in a venue that provides information about all types and stages of breast cancer. Often it is the first place that research results are divulged. Hence I was excited to hear about new approaches to treating this disease, and in that particular hope I was \u2013 with one key exception regarding a hypothetical antibiotic treatment - disappointed. Silos: What struck me with extreme force is learning about the silos in which researchers work. The data (scrubbed of confidential patient information) that's used by scientists is not required to be shared, nor is it uncommon for research results to remain unpublished. Hence the proverbial wheel is invented again and again, since lack of collaboration leads to inefficiency and financial waste. Cancer Cell Lines in Preliminary Research: Researchers usually begin their therapeutic studies with cancer cell lines. Although this may sound like a promising beginning, a study I subsequently located by Memorial Sloan Kettering indicates that \"research done in cancer cell lines \u2013 colonies of cells that derive from a patient's tumor and can be grown in culture indefinitely \u2013 has revealed important insights about the biology of cancer and is essential for the development of new drugs. These cell lines have been generated and shared by laboratories around the world for decades to model different types of cancer. But scientists often question how reliable these cultured cells are as research tools. It is not always known from what subtype of cancer a particular cell line was derived or to what extent the cells actually resemble their tissue of origin after years in culture. A team of Memorial Sloan Kettering investigators examined in molecular detail the resemblance of cancer cell lines to real tumors by comparing their genomic profiles. Focusing on a common form of ovarian cancer known as high-grade serous ovarian cancer, the researchers found that the cell lines most often used for research are not ideal models for this disease because their genetic makeup differs significantly from that of real tumors.\" From: https://www.mskcc.org/blog/do-cell-lines-really-re... Therefore, if the very foundation of cancer research is questionable - at least in some instances \u2013 then it appears as though a vast amount of money and time is being spent building a skyscraper on a sandbox. A far more rational approach would be for researchers to obtain fresh tumor cells from patients whose specific cancer type is under investigation. One might even conceive of a \"tumor donor\" registry that operates in much the same way as organ donation, with the exception that both living and deceased patients could be listed on the registry. Lack of Iteration of Current Therapies and Sequence for Administration: Although mention was occasionally made regarding guidelines pertaining to the type and sequence of therapy that should be leveraged when treating the subtypes and stages of breast cancer, this information was mentioned in a haphazard manner which was not emphasized enough. One speaker frankly admitted that oncologists are not always up-to-date regarding cancer therapies, and that resulting patient outcomes may be sub-standard as a result. My suggestion would be initiating each relevant SABCS session with an overview of the current treatment guidelines \u2013 including sequential therapies \u2013 and how emerging research findings may alter the course of these treatments in the future. Acknowledgments Regarding Cancer Therapy Toxicity: I was pleased to hear physicians concede that some cancer therapies are highly toxic to patients without conferring tangible Overall Survival (OS) benefit. One such drug is Afinitor (Everolimus), which is FDA-approved with Exemestane (Aromasin) in treating endocrine resistant mbc patients. In a clinical trial for advanced breast cancer, 63% of patients taking Afinitor had to reduce the dose or temporarily stop treatment due to side effects, compared with 14% who got a placebo. And 24% of the patients had to stop using it altogether compared with 5% received a placebo. Furthermore, nearly one in five (almost 20%) of Afinitor patients developed non-infectious pneumonitis - an inflammation of the lung tissue. This condition is especially significant because research from Weill Cornell Medicine indicates that pre-existing inflammation in the lungs may increase the risk that cancers originating elsewhere will spread (metastasize) to that organ. http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-12-lung-inflamm... Since 2009 when Afinitor was introduced to the market, there have been nearly 9,000 reports of serious adverse reactions including more than 2,700 deaths and over 3,100 hospitalizations. These statistics are formidable, especially inasmuch as Afinitor has not been found to increase Overall Survival in mbc patients. In fact, 74% of cancer drugs approved over the past decade came without proof of a survival benefit. From: http://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/slippe... Therefore, the benefits of newly-approved cancer therapy drugs should be carefully weighed against patient toxicities when deciding upon a new course of treatment. INFORMATION Simply stated, no breast cancer treatment breakthroughs were announced at SABCS 2015. It was disappointing to observe that no studies were available about one of the most heartbreaking, understudied, and increasingly common sites of mbc \u2013 namely Leptomeningeal Metastasis (LM). Most of the therapies listed below are in clinical trials, so obtaining these treatments outside from a study may be difficult. Brain Metastases: ANG1005: This Taxol-like drug, which is being studied as of October 2015 in a clinical trial for mbc patients with brain metastasis, is providing encouraging results in this population. In a Phase II study of 10 patients with a total of 32 metastatic brain lesions, 15 of the 32 lesions showed a 20% or greater reduction within a specified timeframe. Among patients who went on to additional cycles of ANG1005, two of the 10 patients had confirmed partial responses and seven patients had stable disease. From: http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/01/angioche... Lapatinib (Tykerb) and Xeloda (Capecitabine): The studies that have explored the combination of Lapatinib and are generally small in size, ranging from 13 to 138 patients. In nearly all studies, 85\u2013100% of patients received prior Herceptin and WBR. CNS response ranged from 20 to 30%, which appears to be an improvement over responses observed with Lapatinib alone. One study addressed the role of the Lapatinib and Xeloda combination prior to WBRT. In this study, 45 patients with newly diagnosed Brain Metastases (BM) were enrolled, of which 36 (80%) patients had two or more BM and 42 (93%) patients received prior Herceptin. This study showed an impressive (67%) CNS response rate, defined as 50% volumetric reduction of CNS lesions. Median time to progression was 5.5 months and median time to whole-brain irradiation was 8.3 months. From: http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/759026_5 ONT-380 is a small molecule inhibitor of the HER2 growth factor receptor. The drug works by targeting the HER2 \"tyrosine kinase\" - a link in the chain of communication that allows HER2 receptors to signal the growth of the cell. The fact that it is a small molecule means the drug is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier to act against brain metastases of the disease. In the first study of ONT-380 with TDM-1, all 8 evaluable patients with brain metastases experienced more than 50% reduction in primary brain tumor size. In another study of 33 evaluable patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer (with and without brain metastases), 19 (58 percent) showed clinical benefit, with 16 achieving at least \"stable disease\" (i.e. no tumor progression while on trial), 11 patients experienced \"partial response\" (i.e. tumor shrinkage of more than 30%). Of 8 patients with brain metastases, 5 achieved at least stable disease, with 2 partial responses and one complete response in which existing brain metastases were undetectable after treatment. From: http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/uoc... and http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-12/uoc... Androgen Therapy: Research indicates that 88% of estrogen-positive breast cancers, 50% of HER2+ breast cancers, and 25% of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are Androgen-Receptor (AR) positive, making Androgen Receptor positive MBC a target for emerging therapies underway in Clinical Trials. GTX-024 (Enobosarm): This anti-androgen drug was tested in a study of 17 heavily pretreated ER positive, Androgen Receptor (AR) positive mbc patients. After 6 months, 6 (35%) of the patients exhibited a Clinical Benefit of stable disease with minimal toxicity. From: http://www.biotechnologyevents.com/node/7363 HER2+ MBC Therapies: Alisertib (MLN0237): This is an oral drug under investigation for its potential to overcome endocrine therapy resistance in advanced breast cancer patients, which even had a positive impact on a HER2+ patient. In a study of 45 response-evaluable patients, 6 (13%) had a Partial Response and 26 (58%) had stable disease. Median duration of stable disease was 68 days, of which 2 patients (4%) had stable disease longer than 6 months. One HER2+ patient with 2 prior lines of therapy had a Partial Response of 6 months. As of December 2015, there are several recruiting clinical trials for this drug. From: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/72/24_Su... ONT-380 as previously described under \"Brain Metastases.\" Poziotinib: is an oral, HER-2 directed therapy directed at HER2+ mbc patients for whom at least two prior HER2 therapies and a taxane failed. In a study described at the 2015 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, Poziotinib provided an overall response rate of 60%, a clinical benefit rate of 80%, and a medial Progression Free Survival of 28 weeks. From: http://www.trmoncology.com/uncategorized/spectrum-... Trastuzumab (Herceptin) for patients who were previously treated with this drug: One study indicated that HER2+ mbc patients who has been previously treated with Herceptin for early stage breast cancer could still benefit from first-line HER2+ mbc therapy consisting of Herceptin, Perjeta, and a Taxane, despite the fact that they had already received Herceptin. Hormone (Endocrine) Receptor Positive MBC Therapies: Alisertib (MLN0237), as previously described under HER2+ MBC Therapies Buparlisib (BKM120) and Faslodex (Fulvestrant): Buparlisib is a PI3K inhibitor which may be effective in modestly delaying progression, especially in a subset of mbc patients in whom liquid biopsy identifies a PI3K mutation. In the phase 3 BELLE-2 clinical trial, 1,147 women were randomly assigned to receive either a combination of Buparlisib and Faslodex or Faslodex plus placebo. The study showed a statistically significant 22% reduction in risk for progression with the addition of Buparlisib to Faslodex, yielding a small Progression Free Survival (PFS) of 6.9 months, versus 5 months in the Faslodex-only arm. But among 200 patients in whom the PI3KCA mutation was detected by liquid biopsy, there was a 44% reduction in the risk for progression for those treated with Buparlisib and Faslodex instead of Faslodex alone. Overall Survival (OS) figures from this study are not yet available. It should be noted that Buparlisib may cause substantial side effects such as elevated liver enzymes, nausea, diarrhea, and depression. From: http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/855908#vp_1 HER2 Targeted Therapy for HER2 Negative Patients: A presentation at the 2015 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium revealed the results of a German study providing HER2 therapy to HER2 negative mbc patients were discussed. In this study, 25 heavily pretreated HER2 negative mbc patients who had failed anywhere from 2 to 16 prior therapies received Herceptin plus Lapatinib or Herceptin plus Pertuzumab. HER2-targeting therapy was given either alone or with endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted drugs. 10 patients had a Partial Response and another 10 patients had Stable Disease, with Median Overall Survival of 63 weeks. From: http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/suppl_... Lapatinib (Tykerb) plus Fulvestrant or an AI: This is another example whereby HER2-targeted therapy appears to improve outcomes for endocrine resistant mbc patients. In a Phase II study of 28 evaluable hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative mbc patients who progressed on either an Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) or Faslodex, oral Lapatinib was added to their existing AI or Faslodex treatment. All 4 patients with who had PIK3CA pathway mutations demonstrated a Clinical Benefit at 16 weeks, and 3 of 4 demonstrated Clinical Benefit 24 weeks. In total, the addition of Lapatinib to either Faslodex or an AI in hormone therapy-resistant mbc patients restored endocrine therapy sensitivity to in 25% of patients with HER 2 negative BC. From: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26303828 TNBC MBC: Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A): This is a PD-L1 inhibitor immunotherapy drug similar to Keytruda. The PD-1 protein and a related molecule called PD-L1 play a key role in the ability of tumor cells to evade the host's immune system. Interactions between PD-1 and PD-L1 were found in preclinical studies to enhance immune function and help promote antitumor activity. In a multicenter phase I trial testing MPDL3280A, 12 TNBC patients whose tumors had the PD-L1 protein were studied. Most had already undergone at least two prior therapies. Patients received intravenous injections of MPDL3280A every three weeks for up to one year. Of the nine patients who could be evaluated, one patient had a Complete Response, two had a Partial Response and one patient had Stable Disease. All of these responses occurred within six weeks of receiving the first dose of the drug. Outcomes appear to indicate that MPDL3280A, when paired with Abraxane in metastatic TNBC patients, had a confirmed overall response rate of 42% which outperformed another PD-L1 inhibitor called Avelumab. From: http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/SABCS/...\">www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCo... and www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCo... IMMU-132 (Sacituzumab Govitecan): This is an SN-38 Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) that targets a special antigen called \"TROP-2\" expressed on many cancers. In 2014 IMMU-132 received much publicity for its effectiveness against TNBC. IMMU-132 has been reported to produce a Partial Response rate of 30% and a 70% Clinical Benefit Rate (stable disease), in patients with metastatic TNBC who had been heavily pretreated. This drug has received FDA \"Fast Track\" Designation (Fast Track Designation is meant to facilitate the development and review of new drugs intended to treat serious conditions). In a different study reported in the ASCO 2015 conference, of 49 MBC patients with TNBC who took IMMU-132, 15 patients (31%), showed a reduction in tumor size of 30% or more. Two of these patients had a complete response. Adding the 22 patients with responses between less than 30% tumor shrinkage and less than 20% tumor increase, the disease control rate was 76%. At the 2015 SABCS conference, a study reported that among the 60 intent-to-treat TNBC mbc patients who had received a median of 5 prior lines of therapy, the interim median progression-free survival was 6.0 months, with 58% of patients having experienced a progression-free survival event. There is a significant positive correlation between progression-free survival and maximal tumor shrinkage relative to baseline for the 31 patients whose cancer had progressed after reporting stable disease, partial, or complete response as their best response. Median overall survival data were too early to report, with 83% of patients still alive. From: http://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Immuno...(IMMU)+Announces+Positive+Complete+Response+Data+from+Sacituzumab+Govitecan+Study+in+TNBC/10610385.html and http://www.raredr.com/news/update-on-triple-negati... A Hypothesis for Treating All Cancer Types: At SABCS I had the pleasure to attend a presentation by Michael Lisanti about the potential efficacy of antibiotics in treating cancer. The concept behind using antibiotics in cancer therapy is that cellular mutations are thought to accumulate in tissue stem cells, which in turn may drive the formation of Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs). Based on this premise, a new study in Italy will target a common attribute of CSCs across multiple tumor types \u2013 namely mitochondrial biogenesis (replication) for the survival of CSCs. Because mitochondria evolved from bacteria, many FDA-approved antibiotics target mitochondria as a mild side-effect which is well-tolerated in most patients. In a preclinical study, it was found that 4-to-5 different classes of FDA-approved antibiotics which inhibit mitochondrial biogenesis could be used to eradicate CSCs in at least 12 different cancer cell lines across 8 different tumor types, including breast cancer. The antibiotic \"Doxycycline\" may be especially attractive as a new anti-cancer agent because it has a long half-life and has been used successfully for the long-term treatment of patients with various infections. Recent clinical trials with the antibiotics Doxycycline and Azithromycin show positive therapeutic effects in cancer patients, although their selective effects on eradicating cancer stem cells are not yet known. These trials were performed on advanced or treatment-resistant patients with B-cell lymphoma or lung cancer. In lung cancers, Azithromycin significantly increased 1-year patient survival from 45% to 75%, a 1.7-fold increase. And even lymphoma patients who were \"bacteria-free\" benefited from only a 3-week course of doxycycline therapy, and some showed complete remission of the disease. Future clinical trials for testing the efficacy of mitochondrially-targeted antibiotics in multiple cancer types are clearly clinically warranted.

The results of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial examining the intervention led by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania are published online this week in the journal Cancer. The study is the first demonstration of EA's efficacy for both joint pain relief, as well as these other common symptoms. The results build upon earlier findings reported in November 2013, showing that EA can decrease the joint pain reported by roughly 50 percent of breast cancer patients taking AIs \u2013 the most-commonly prescribed medications to prevent disease recurrence among post-menopausal women with early-stage, hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

      "Content": "Dec 19, 2015 08:55AM - edited Dec 19, 2015 08:56AM by Bestbird I am so glad the recap is informative! It would be wonderful if the antibiotic hypothesis were to be successful, but do not want to falsely raise hopes at this juncture. After the lecture, I spoke with Dr. Christina Addison, a researcher at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI) which is exploring the use of less toxic therapies against cancer. Dr. Addison indicated that for several months the OHRI had mbc patients on Doxycycline without much success, although part of the problem may have been using too high a dose for this population. That said, there was an anecdote by a lady in the audience who stated that the only member of her family who never contracted cancer is an elderly woman who has been on antibiotics for years for a chronic condition, and finally this lady feels there-s a reason - namely antibiotic use. So the jury is far from \"out\" regarding antibiotics. Divine, Afinitor (Everolimus) is mentioned in the section entitled, \"Acknowledgments Regarding Cancer Therapy Toxicity.\" Fitz, indeed there are pockets within the research community whereby an attempt is being made to share information and depersonalized data! Here's one that Agness (Ann) identified called Project Data Sphere: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/201505110050... That said, I could find no mention of Project Data Sphere at SABCS. After the conference, I wrote to Richard Markow, the Director of SABCS, suggesting that relevant sessions open with a recap of the current guidelines and sequence for treating the various subtypes and phases of breast cancer. I explained that I'd attended the session as a patient advocate and quickly learned that many oncologists were unaware of this key information, and that patient care may suffer as a result. He kindly wrote back (mistakenly referring to me as \"Dr. Loeser\") indicating that it will be brought to the attention of the SABCS Co-directors when the 2016 symposium is planned. One item that was mentioned at the conference is an immunotherapy being studied for TNBC called IMMU-132 (Sacituzumab Govitecan) . Although there've been previous studies mentioned at prior conferences, the results of a newer study were provided at 2015 SABCS confirming its efficacy. Below is a quick paragraph about this promising drug: A study reported that among the 60 intent-to-treat TNBC mbc patients who had received a median of 5 prior lines of therapy, the interim median progression-free survival was 6.0 months, with 58% of patients having experienced a progression-free survival event. There is a significant positive correlation between progression-free survival and maximal tumor shrinkage relative to baseline for the 31 patients whose cancer had progressed after reporting stable disease, partial, or complete response as their best response. Median overall survival data were too early to report, with 83% of patients still alive. I will shortly begin co-authoring (along with a Medical Writer) a series of papers for the MBCA regarding Exceptional Responders, so I may not be as active on the forums as in the past.

Thoracentesis (sometimes referred to as \u201ctapping\u201d)is an outpatient procedure thatinvolves placing one needle per required side into the pleural space.  Although local anesthesia is administered, this procedure can be uncomfortable and may cause scarring if repeated over time.  The procedure also does not hinder fluid buildup again.  These tips may make the procedure less uncomfortable: 1)  Request a numbing agent before the needle is inserted to feel more comfortable after the procedure. 2) Request that the fluid to be withdrawn slowly in order to avoid low blood pressure or a \u201cfainting\u201d feeling afterwards. 3) Lean forward with a soft pillow supporting your head and upper torso while the draining is underway via your back.

The patients in the study had either: HER2-positive breast cancer, HER2\u2013low expressing breast cancer (considered HER2 negative), HER2-positive gastric cancer, or various other HER2-expressing solid tumors. Data revealed that the overall response rate with trastuzumab deruxtecan was 59.5% and the disease control rate was an impressive 93.7%.

Also, please consider going on Palliative Care, which is very different from hospice. Below is an excerpt about it from my MBC Guide. You (and others) are welcome to request a complimentary copy of the 100+ page booklet by visiting the top of this page:https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/... I hope you begin to fell substantially better very soon! Palliative care is meant to help anyone with a serious illness. It differs from hospice care in that the patient can continue to receive standard treatment for their condition while on palliative care.Patients can request it at any age and any stage of an illness (even upon diagnosis), and it can be used along with curative treatment.Palliative care is not dependent on prognosis.With palliative care, patients can expect to have more control over their care, along with a comfortable and supportive atmosphere that reduces anxiety and stress.The patient's condition and situation are reviewed regularly by their palliative care team, and they are discussed with the patient to make sure that the patient's needs and wishes are being met and that treatments are in line with the patient's goals. Palliative care can reduce symptoms such as pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, constipation, nausea, loss of appetite and difficulty sleeping.It addresses the whole person and helps them to carry on with daily life.It can improve one's ability to go through medical treatments and help the patient to better understand their condition and choices for medical care. In short, it enhances the patient's Quality Of Life (QOL). Therefore, patients may wish to start palliative care early for best results, and they should request it from their doctor instead of waiting for their medical team to bring it up. Most insurance plans, including Medicare and Medicaid, cover all or part of palliative care treatment.Palliative care is generally available in a number of places including hospitals, outpatient clinics, long-term-care facilities, hospices, or home.Usually a team of specialists, including palliative care doctors, nurses and social workers, provide this type of care in conjunction with the patient's doctor.Massage therapists, pharmacists, nutritionists and others might also be part of the team.To obtain palliative care in order to manage cancer or treatment side effects, the patient should speak with her or his doctor or nurse. Alternatively, patients can look up Palliative Care providers in their area at: http://getpalliativecare.org/providers/ ",

The initial weeks and months after a mets diagnosis are the hardest. Dealing with the shock and fear can be very difficult. But as others have said, over time it gets a bit easier, and you'll find many people who are doing well with a good quality of life!  I was diagnosed with multiple lung mets, malignant pleural effusion and malignant pericardial effusion in 2011, which was 18 years after my initial bc diagnosis.  I am on hormonal therapy since the biopsy showed the mets to be ER+, and am gratefully doing everything I used to do before the diagnosis.  If it\u2019s possible, have the met(s) biopsied to see what their estrogen (ER), Progesterone (PR) and Her2 status are, since they may differ from the original cancer. If your cancer is ER+ your oncologist should be considering hormonal treatment, and if it's Her2+ then Herceptin should be added. Additionally, you may want to request testing to see whether the tumor has Androgen Receptors (AR), since there are some promising clinical trials that target Androgen Receptors in a similar manner as current hormonal therapy targets Estrogen Receptors (ER). This is very important: Please remember to keep copies of all tests results and scans in case you eventually want to have a second opinion from a specialist outside your medical network. You may also want to seek a second opinion about your treatment at any time. Please post if you have questions, and wishing you a great outcome!",

In addition, if you might be interested, after draining the ascites can be sent for chemo sensitivity testing.  The malignant liquid would be tested against different chemos and combos to see what it may be susceptible to, and what it may be resistant to.  This is still considered controversial and many doctors do not believe in it, and it may not be covered by insurance.  However, several people have indicated that it has helped them and that it was superior to the hit-or-miss approach to chemo that is used today.  If you are interested, two viable places are Rational Therapeutics http://www.rationaltherapeutics.com/  and Weisenthal. http://weisenthalcancer.com/Home.html  I understand if you prefer not to do any of these things.  But since you are otherwise strong (you've been working!) and you have a new grandbaby, it may not yet be time to throw in the towel.  And we'd all be there with you if in a few months you are better and flipping the bird to your onc!

For early stage cancer, your Tamoxifen was considered \"adjuvant\" treatment, which is meant to lessen the risk of recurrence. I am sorry it didn't quite work out for you, as it doesn't work for some. I was on adjuvant Tamoxifen for 5 years and recurred years later with mbc. Once one is diagnosed with metastasis, the very first treatment given to them irrespective of whether if is hormonal, chemo, and/or targeted is called \"first line treatment.\" If and when that treatment no longer works, the next treatment prescribed is called \"second line\" treatment. And so on. Doctors generally will not prescribe a treatment that a patient has already taken unless: 1) it had initially been successful for a satisfactory length of time, and 2) sufficient time - usually several years - have elapsed since the patient took it.

I hope your friend rallies and adds her name to the list of those who \"fails\" hospice! \"I can certainly tell you what I have been taking; the only problem is that the artesunate seems to be in used in only three clinics: Victoria, Seattle, and I think Saskatchewan.

I hope this helps.  As of now I have completed the ten week protocol, and am on a maintenance plan taking daily oral artemisinin and injecting Iscador twice a week.

The initial weeks and months after a mets diagnosis are the hardest. Dealing with the shock and fear can be very difficult. But as others have said, over time it gets a bit easier, and you'll find many people who are doing well with a good quality of life! If it\u2019s possible, have the met(s) biopsied to see what their estrogen (ER), Progesterone (PR) and HER2 status are, since they may differ from the original cancer. If the cancer is ER+ and/or PR+, then the oncologist should be considering hormonal treatment, and if it's HER2+ then Herceptin and Perjeta should be provided along with a Taxane. Additionally, you may want to request testing to see whether the tumor has Androgen Receptors (AR), since there are some promising clinical trials that target Androgen Receptors in a similar manner as current hormonal therapy targets Estrogen Receptors (ER). Even if you are hormone receptor negative (ER- and PR-) you may still consider hormonal therapy according to the latest (2014) National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, \u201cPatients may be candidates for hormonal therapy irrespective of their hormone receptivity status, provided that their cancer is in the bones, soft tissue (muscle, fat or nerves), or internal organs and is not causing symptoms.  The reason for suggesting hormonal therapy is because sometimes the metastasis is indeed hormone receptor positive and the actual test results are incorrect.  (This represents a major shift in thinking regarding potential therapies for TNBC and hormone receptor negative patients). From:  http://www.nccn.org/patients/guidelines/stage_iv_breast/index.html#33/z This is very important: Please remember to keep copies of all tests results and scans in case there eventually is a need or desire to have a second opinion from a specialist outside your medical network. You may also want to seek a second opinion at any point about treatment. Please post if you have questions, and wishing you a great outcome!",

Since there's a large volume of supplements and a sometimes-bewildering amount of information to sort through, you may want a professional's guidance to assist in obtaining the best supplemental therapies for your situation. To that end, you might want to consider adding a Naturopathic Oncologist (NO) to your medical team. NOs typically customize a patient's protocol based upon lab tests they order that the patient's Medical Oncologist normally doesn't request (such as VEGF, IL-8, etc.).Before consulting with an NO, patients need to forward all medical records and test results, which will be reviewed during the initial consultation (I did mine by phone since my Naturopathic Oncologist is in a different state). .After the first one or two consultations, the patient will receive an individualized protocol.Periodically thereafter, the NO will order lab tests in order to track how things are going and engage the patient in another consultation that sometimes results in an updated protocol.Whenever the patient has a medical test done through their Medical Oncologist, they should forward the results to their NO. Prior to working with my NO, I had set up a supplement regimen, and when I started liaising with my NO, he took me off one supplement because he said it might interfere with my conventional therapy. A good NO will know what works with standard of care and what may interfere with it. A considerable drawback is that an NO's services are generally not covered by medical insurance. For books on the subject, Shetland Pony has offered some excellent recommendations which will give you an excellent overview!

I remember an article way back in 1991 in the American Journal of Epidemiology that showed (in one experiment) that women who take Motrin (Ibuprofen) at least 4 times a week had 50 percent less incidence of breast cancer. Motrin, like Aspirin is an NSAID drug that inhibits Cyclooxygenase enzyme(Forms 1 and 2). You think this would be front page news day after day.\" That said, low-dose aspirin certainly isn't a cure.  Tina2, admittedly the final sentences of the Medivizor-reported study can make one cross one's eyes.   That said, overall it is possible that taking it with the permission of one's oncologist - provided there are no contraindications - may be an effective weapon in the overall arsenal.   ",

Based upon test tube and mouse studies, a team of researchers  claims that a dose of aspirin (equivalent to low-dose aspirin for humans) each day can help eliminate the chances of breast cancer spreading. The study has been put forward by researchers inside the oncology unit of the Kansas City Veterans Affairs Medical Center. According to the research team, aspirin can make breast cancer cells inconducive to further growth. In the study, the team grew cancerous cells in 96 different cell line groups. The researchers then treated half of the cancerous cells -- similar to the For the next step, the team injected tumorous mice with 75 milligrams of aspirin. The mice were given the drug for 15 days, after which researchers observed that mice treated with aspirin had tumors half the size of the ones in the mice who were not given any treatment at all.  From: http://www.ibtimes.com/study-says-aspirin-may-help-reduce-breast-cancer-growth-spread-1967043 Before adding aspirin or any other supplement to their cancer regimens, patients should first consult with their doctor because aspirins may thin the blood, which can be harmful to some patients. In addition to the above, according to a study reported in the July 2014 edition of the British Journal of Cancer,4,627 women diagnosed with breast cancer were followed for an average of 5.7 years.  14.7% of these patients took aspirin regularly prior to diagnosis, and 22.4% took aspirin following their diagnosis, for an average of 2.4 years.  Patients who used aspirin after diagnosis tended to be older, have fewer metastasis, and smaller tumors. They were less likely to have been treated with chemotherapy, radiation or surgery, and were more likely to have used endocrine (hormonal) therapy. The study concluded that taking aspirin after a breast cancer diagnosis educed the risk of all-cause mortality by 47% and specifically reduced the risk of dying from breast-cancer by 58%.  Conversely taking aspirin before diagnosis increased overall mortality risk by 62% and doubled the risk of dying from breast cancer after contracting the disease.

I was diagnosed with a similar situation in 2011, along with malignant pericardial effusion.  I had a Pleurx catheter inserted which I had for about 6 weeks when things dried up.  Between thetalc procedure and your systemic therapy, your lung situation should greatly improve!

Additionally, since you are going through treatments fairly quickly, I might suggest bringing up the following with your doctor. Additionally, if you may be able to afford it, incorporating a Naturopathic Oncologist (NO) into your medical team may be a good idea in order to optimize your health. Best wishes! A possibility to consider is chemo sensitivity testing. The tumor or malignant effusion, if any, would be tested against different chemotherapy drugs - and combinations thereof - to see what it may be susceptible to, and what it may be resistant to.This is still considered controversial and many doctors are not convinced of its value.Furthermore, it might not be covered by insurance.However, several people have indicated that it has helped them and that it was superior to the hit-or-miss approach to chemo that is used today.If you are interested, two viable places are Rational Therapeutics www.rationaltherapeutics.com/and Weisenthal.http://weisenthalcancer.com/Home.html Dr. Weisenthal has been doing this since the 1990s, so he has extensive experience. Here's a link to a meta-analysis study that concluded there's a two-fold overall tumor response for a chemo assay-guided therapy versus standard of care therapy, and that patients who received assay-guided therapy compared to those who received standard of care or physician's choice had a significantly higher 1-year survival rate http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/118466-132 ",

The initial weeks and months after a mets diagnosis are the hardest. Dealing with the shock and fear can be very difficult. But as others have said, over time it gets a bit easier, and you'll find many people who are doing well with a good quality of life! If it's possible, have the met(s) biopsied to see what their estrogen (ER), Progesterone (PR) and HER2 status are, since they may differ from the original cancer (if you were previously diagnosed). If the cancer is ER+ and/or PR+, then the oncologist should be considering hormonal treatment, and if it's HER2+ then Herceptin and Perjeta may be considered along with a Taxane. Additionally, you may want to request testing to see whether the tumor has Androgen Receptors (AR), since there are some promising clinical trials that target Androgen Receptors in a similar manner as current hormonal therapy targets Estrogen Receptors (ER). Even if you are hormone receptor negative (ER- and PR-) you may still consider hormonal therapy according to the latest (2014) National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, \"Patients may be candidates for hormonal therapy irrespective of their hormone receptivity status, provided that their cancer is in the bones, soft tissue (muscle, fat or nerves), or internal organs and is not causing symptoms. The reason for suggesting hormonal therapy is because sometimes the metastasis is indeed hormone receptor positive and the actual test results are incorrect. (This represents a major shift in thinking regarding potential therapies for TNBC and hormone receptor negative patients). From: http://www.nccn.org/patients/guidelines/stage_iv_breast/index.html#33/z This is very important: Please remember to keep copies of all tests results and scans in case there eventually is a need or desire to have a second opinion from a specialist outside your medical network. You may also want to seek a second opinion at any point about treatment.

For years, I ate and adored sugary foods.  My favorite was glazed donuts from a local bakery.  The though of them made me weak at the knees, and I'd be joyful with each mouthful.  I loved ice cream cookies, cake - you name it.  But I worked out and wasn't overweight. Then everything changed with my recurrence.  I went \"cold turkey\" off sugar, gluten, meat, and dairy (except the Budwig Flaxseed oil and Cottage Cheese) for 6 months.  But I became depressed, so when I need and want to, I have added a little bit of the food(s) I enjoy.  What's been interesting - and I have heard this from others who've done a similar diet - is that I've mostly lost my desire for sweets.  Now my beloved donut just doesn't taste great, and overall I do not crave sugar. I recognize that for most people, going cold turkey for 6 months is not the answer.  And I do know that depriving ourselves of things we enjoy is not recommended.  So I'd advise going for a few days w/o sweets, as you have decided.  Then if you find you are truly missing a treat, add some lovely dark chocolate (>70% cocoa) as a treat.  Dark chocolate is reputedly good for us and is also quite satisfying.  A few other tips: if you have something sweet, eat a protein (i.e. nuts) with it to reduce the insulin reaction.  Also, munching on grapes or another fruit you enjoy may provide the satisfaction you crave! Start with manageable goals.  And I wouldn't be surprised if, over time, your tastes may change as well!    ",

If you have questions regarding the source of any of the statistics herein, please let me know and I'll be happy to send the information to you. Take a deep breath - it's October! The Other Side of the Pink Ribbon Each autumn as the leaves fall, we find ourselves in the midst of Breast Cancer Awareness Month with its races for cures, upbeat survivor stories, and bright pink T-shirts.  Slogans such as \"Early Detection Saves Lives\" seem to be everywhere, and corporations fly banners in support of finding the as-yet elusive cure for this disease.  Despite the relative grimness associated with breast cancer and its standard treatments, pink ribbons fly gaily while people march in well-intended efforts to make us aware, again, of the disease called breast cancer. Do you know anyone over the age of 18 who hasn't heard of breast cancer? I certainly don't. There are certainly advantages to becoming \"aware\" of something to the point of vigilance, and most of the existing breast cancer information has been confined to early detection.  The inference is that early detection saves lives and that if caught early, the disease is curable.  Now for the bombshell:  this disease is not always curable.  Nearly 30% of those whose breast cancer is initially confined to the breast and/or lymph nodes will recur with metastatic disease, and approximately 6% of all newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients have metastatic disease from the start.  According to the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network, metastatic disease carries a median survival of 3 years and there has been no statistically significant improvement in the past twenty years.  Certainly nothing to gaily wave banners about. Given that more than 1 out of 3 persons diagnosed with breast cancer will eventually die of it, it's time to pin awareness about metastatic disease to the October breast cancer message. What is metastatic breast cancer, which is also referred to as Stage IV breast cancer?  It's cancer that started in the breast and spread to other organs such as the liver, lungs, bones and brain.  Today there are about 162,000 women - and men - living with metastatic breast cancer in the U.S.  Some of them developed metastatic disease 5, 10, 15, or even 20 or more years after their initial diagnosis.  Many are relatively young people in their 20's and 30s with growing families.  According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 39,520 women and 450 men died from metastatic breast cancer in 2011.  The sad news is that this figure hasn't changed much since 2000 despite many years of \"Breast Cancer Awareness.\" In practical terms, if it took you 14 minutes to read your paper today, someone will have died from metastatic breast cancer in that timeframe. Treatment protocols for metastatic breast cancer and non-metastatic breast cancer are fairly similar. These include chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, hormonal therapy, targeted biologic therapy, bisphosphonates, and/or other medications.  The difference is that people diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer are treated for a limited time in order to eradicate their disease - hopefully forever.  Conversely, people diagnosed with metastatic disease will remain on some sort of therapy for the rest of their lives, with a few possible breaks between treatments.  Their treatment is considered palliative - it is meant to control the cancer and its symptoms while providing as good a quality of life as possible, but not to eliminate the disease indefinitely.  As you might imagine, this can be devastating news to the newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer patient. Most metastatic breast cancer patients proceed from one treatment to the next when their disease progresses.  After they have exhausted all of the available treatments - including clinical trials - they've arrived at the end of their list.  This can have an absolutely demoralizing psychological impact, as it implies that there's no hope left.  A simple but currently challenging option for these patients is to give them access to promising new but unapproved therapies.  This is referred to as \"compassionate use.\"  Currently, compassionate use is legal but tightly restricted based upon criteria that can be terribly difficult to meet.  Relaxing the compassionate use guidelines for metastatic breast cancer patients would enable them to undergo additional therapies that could potentially prolong their lives and well-being. Fortunately, there are new treatments on the horizon for both metastatic and non-metastatic breast cancer.  Scientists recently completed mapping the genetic mutations in breast cancer, an effort that may change the way that patients' tumors are classified and treated.  They also found that some forms of a particularly aggressive disease referred to as Triple Negative Breast Cancer (\"TNBC\") resemble ovarian cancer more than breast cancer, implying that therapies for ovarian cancer may prove more effective than breast cancer therapies for these patients.  Findings such as these are only possible through research, and research requires funding. Most people are unaware that metastatic breast cancer is woefully underfunded.  Only 3% of breast cancer funding is channeled towards metastatic disease.  If an estimated 36% of breast cancer patients suffer metastatic disease at some point during their lives, then it would only be fair to allocate an equal percentage of funding its research and treatment.  Why is this additional funding for metastatic breast cancer research and treatment so important?  Because a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer is not an immediate death sentence. As per Dr. Susan Love's Research Foundation, 22% of patients are still alive five years after diagnosis, 10% survive 10 years after diagnosis, and 2% to 3% may live a normal lifespan.  The more we learn about metastatic breast cancer, the more effectively we can treat it and improve these statistics.  Furthermore, there's the possibility of retroactivity and crossover - namely, if something works for metastatic breast cancer, it may work for early stage breast cancer and for other types of cancers that have metastasized.  Something else to consider is that many patients with metastatic disease live in pain or disability, so focusing on improving their quality of life is critical for these patients and their caretakers. So the next time you see a pink ribbon fluttering in the wind and are motivated to make a donation, please consider requesting that a third of it be allocated to metastatic disease.  162,000 of us will thank you for it.

The Other Side of the Pink Ribbon Each autumn as the leaves fall, we find ourselves in the midst of Breast Cancer Awareness Month with its races for cures, upbeat survivor stories, and bright pink T-shirts.  Slogans such as \"Early Detection Saves Lives\" seem to be everywhere, and corporations fly banners in support of finding the as-yet elusive cure for this disease.   Despite the relative grimness associated with breast cancer and its standard treatments, pink ribbons fly gaily while people march in well-intended efforts to make us aware, again, of the disease called breast cancer. Do you know anyone over the age of 18 who hasn't heard of breast cancer? I certainly don't. There are certainly advantages to becoming \"aware\" of something to the point of vigilance, and most of the existing breast cancer information has been confined to early detection.  The inference is that early detection saves lives and that if caught early, the disease is curable.  Now for the bombshell:  this disease is not curable.  Nearly 30% of those whose breast cancer is classified as \"early stage\" (Stage 0, I, or II) will eventually develop metastatic disease.  A fair portion of Stage III patients will become metastatic, and 6% to 10% of all newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients have metastatic disease from the start.  So the conservative estimated percentage of patients who will ultimately die from breast cancer is an eye-opening 34% to 40%.  Metastatic disease carries a median survival of 3 years, and there has been no statistically significant improvement in the past twenty years.*  Certainly nothing to gaily wave banners about.   Given that more than 1 out of 3 persons diagnosed with breast cancer will eventually die of it, it's time to pin awareness about metastatic disease to the October breast cancer message. What is metastatic breast cancer, which is also referred to as Stage IV breast cancer?  It's cancer that started in the breast and spread to other organs such as the liver, lungs, bones and brain.  Today there are about 162,000 women - and men - living with metastatic breast cancer in the U.S.  Some of them developed metastatic disease 5, 10, 15, or even 20 or more years after their initial diagnosis.  Many are relatively young people in their 20's and 30s with growing families.  Based upon 2011 estimates, approximately 39,520 women and 450 men are expected to die from metastatic breast cancer annually. The sad news is that this figure hasn't changed much since 2000 despite many years of \"Breast Cancer Awareness.\"  In practical terms, if it took you 14 minutes to read your paper today, someone will have died from metastatic breast cancer in that timeframe. Treatment protocols for metastatic breast cancer and non-metastatic breast cancer are fairly similar. These include chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, hormonal therapy, targeted biologic therapy, bisphosphonates, and/or other medications.  The difference is that people diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer are treated for a limited time in order to eradicate their disease - hopefully forever.  Conversely, people diagnosed with metastatic disease will remain on some sort of therapy for the rest of their lives, with a few possible breaks between treatments.  Their treatment is considered palliative - it is meant to control the cancer and its symptoms while providing as good a quality of life as possible, but not to eliminate the disease indefinitely.  As you might imagine, this can be devastating news to the newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer patient.

      "Content": "Mar 5, 2014 07:31PM - edited Mar 5, 2014 07:34PM by Bestbird JAB, my original (Stage II) bc was diagnosed in 1993 and was ER+ and PR+.  At the time they did not know about Her2.  My solitary lung nodule was found incidentally via CT in 2005, but since it didn't change on a CT 6 months later we didn't follow it further.  The thing I and my MO should have realized is that mets may or may not change quickly, and hence we should have continued to follow it.  But I simply didn't think to do that. By the time my lung mets were diagnosed it was 6 years later, and I'd been symptomatic (and misdiagnosed) for 4 years.  My TMs were always normal but I had a dry cough for 4 years which the doctors thought was either post nasal drip or asthma.  Once I lost my voice (due to a met pressing against the laryngeal nerve which caused paralysis of one vocal cord) a doctor who knew what he was doing ordered the appropriate tests and figured it out.  By then I had a litre of malignant pleural effusion as well as pericardial effusion, and extensive lung mets. In about 30% of the cases where bc metastasizes, it goes to the lung.  Most often it goes to the bone first.  Wherever it goes, it's still bc (not lung cancer or bone cancer). Brenda, thus far I've been on letrozole (knock on wood!).  Thank you so much for asking! AimeeMac, please accept my best wishes on your biopsy!  There is always the possibility that things will turn out to be something other than bc!  Please know we're hoping for good results! All - I participate on three mbc forums almost daily and might sometimes miss someone's question.  I would feel very badly if this were the case. So please feel free to PM me any time - that way I'll  definitely respond! ",

Dealing with the shock and fear can be very difficult. But as others have said, over time it gets a bit easier, and you'll find many people who are doing well with a good quality of life! If it\u2019s possible, have the met(s) biopsied to see what their estrogen (ER), Progesterone (PR) and Her2 status are, since they may differ from the original cancer. If your cancer is ER+ your oncologist should be considering hormonal treatment, and if it's Her2+ then Herceptin should be added. Additionally, you may want to request testing to see whether the tumor has Androgen Receptors (AR), since there are some promising clinical trials that target Androgen Receptors in a similar manner as current hormonal therapy targets Estrogen Receptors (ER). This is very important: Please remember to keep copies of all tests results and scans in case you eventually want to have a second opinion from a specialist outside your medical network. You may also want to seek a second opinion at any point about your treatment. Please post if you have questions, and wishing you a great outcome!",

      "Content": "Nov 3, 2015 08:27PM - edited Nov 3, 2015 08:29PM by Bestbird Admittedly I haven't quite joined the genetic mutation bandwagon yet for the reasons below. And although I am a huge proponent of the the MBC Project, which is focusing on genetic mutations and therapeutic response, I keep reminding their research team that there are considerably more factors than genes to take into account, such as enzymes, proteins, and the tumor's microenvironment. The items listed below are the reasons I'm raising an eyebrow about all this. Hopefully I've got it all wrong and one day scientists will truly figure this out.  In the PALOMA-1 clinical trial, patients with targeted mutations fared no better than patients without them.\"PALOMA-1 was split into two parts, wherein the first part included 66 patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.The second part examined 99 patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative disease and specific biomarkers, including cyclin D1 amplification, p16 loss, or both. Although preclinical data had suggested that ER-positive patients with cyclin D1 amplification and p16 loss might be best responders, this didn't bear out in in the clinical trial.\" From: https://www.genomeweb.com/clinical-genomics/pfizers-palbociclib-doubles-pfs-her2-negative-breast-cancer-falls-short-overall Researchers are beginning to learn that, at least in some cases, targeting genetic mutations through drugs can occasionally backfire.In one study that targeted the PI3K mutation, it was determined that monotherapy (single drug) treatment may actually worsen a patient's cancer by causing more aggressive tumor cell behavior and increasing the likelihood of metastases to other organs. In the study, PI3K inhibition caused mitochondria (the portion of the cell responsible for energy production) to migrate to the peripheral cytoskeleton of the tumor cells, whereas the mitochondria of untreated cells were seen clustered around the cell nucleus.The net result of this was that PI3K inhibition diverted the mitochondria to specialized regions of the cell membrane that are implicated in cell motility, and the cells could move spontaneously, which permitted invasion. From: http://www.targetedonc.com/articles/pi3k-inhibition-may-fuel-cancer-rather-than-fight-it Those who are interested in genetic testing certainly are welcome to proceed after doing their own research! It's just that our expectations need to be realistic, as the media has significantly hyped this area of research. The one exception I've seen is when a genetic flaw causes the overexpression of specific receptors on the cell's surface (such as HER2) whereby if there's a therapy targeting these receptors (i.e. Herceptin) there's a good chance of success.",

A remarkable 4 of 32 patients had complete responses (22), and 1 patient, who was treated for 5 years, had no recurrence of her disease 6 years after stopping DES (23). The question, however, is whether physiologic estrogen has efficacy as an antitumor agent in the appropriately prepared estrogen-deprived breast tumor. Ellis and colleagues (24) addressed this question and found an equivalent clinical benefit for high (30 mg daily) and low (6 mg daily) dose of estradiol in metastatic breast cancer patients who had failed aromatase inhibitor therapy, that is, long-term estrogen deprivation. Their clinical advance was that low-dose estrogen was as efficacious as high-dose estrogen for antitumor therapy in breast cancer (for the appropriate tumor that had been estrogen deprived), but there were fewer side effects with low-dose therapy. The target, estrogen-deprived breast cancer, is vulnerable to physiologic estrogen.     Also, herceptin, an inhibitor of Her-2 pathway, reverses the resistance of LTLT-Ca cells to letrozole (Femara). This suggests cross-talk between the Her-2/MAPK and the ERα pathway is controlling the growth of cancer cells.    In this study, we evaluated the effect of discontinuing letrozole treatment on these signaling pathways and whether hormone sensitivity could be restored in LTLT-Ca cells and tumors. Treatment with letrozole shifted the balance towards the growth factor pathway whereas when the treatment is stopped, compensatory signaling via the Her-2/MAPK pathway declined, ERα levels were restored and the cells regain their original sensitivity to letrozole.  ",

The findings highlight the level of glutamine, an essential nutrient for cancer development, as a determinant of breast cancer response to select anticancer therapies, and identify a marker associated with glutamine uptake, for potential prognosis and stratification of breast cancer therapy. For some time researchers have known that many tumor cell types are dependent on glutamine for growth and survival, but didn't know how glutamine uptake was regulated. The new findings demonstrate the importance of RNF5 in the control of glutamine uptake, and in antagonizing tumor development. The findings also suggest that testing tumors for RNF5 and glutamine carrier protein levels, such as SLC1A5, may be used to identify patients best suited to taxanes-based therapy. \"Not all tumors are equipped to respond to paclitaxel therapy,\" said Ronai. \"Using a cohort of more than 500 breast cancer patient samples, we found that only 30 percent of tumors exhibit high levels of RNF5 and low levels of glutamine carrier proteins\u2014the optimal profile for response to paclitaxel.\" \"Our study indicates that a protein called RNF5 determines breast cancer response to paclitaxel, one of the most common chemotherapy drugs,\" said Ze'ev Ronai, Ph.D., scientific director of Sanford-Burnham's La Jolla campus. \"Paclitaxel belongs to a class of drugs called taxanes that work by triggering a stress response in cells that in turn promotes an interaction between RNF5 and glutamine uptake proteins. We found that this interaction causes degradation of the glutamine carrier proteins, leading to an insufficient supply of glutamine and the sensitization of breast cancer tumors to death.\" \"We also used this patient cohort to test the predictive value of measuring levels of glutamine carrier proteins as a prognostic marker,\" said Ronai. Our results indicate that these proteins are an outstanding marker of patient outcome, as good as currently used markers.\" \"We have started screening for inhibitors of glutamine carrier proteins as a potential new target for breast cancer treatment,\" said Ronai.\" From: http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-03-mechanism-glutamine-uptake-breast-cancer.html Dx 10/6/2011, IDC, Left, Stage IV, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

The FoundationOne test sequences clinical tumor samples to characterize the exons of 315 cancer-associated genes and introns from 28 genes involved in rearrangements. The Guardant360 test uses cell-free circulating DNA from blood to sequence 70 genes. The study evaluated nine patientswith breast cancer (n = 5), pancreatic cancer, thymic carcinoma, lung cancer and salivary gland cancer (n = 1 for each). Results: One patient had no identified genetic alteration using either sequencing test. The remaining eight patients harbored 45 alterations, only 10 (22%) of which were concordant (in agreement) between FoundationOne and Guardant360 platforms. In two (25%) of the other eight patients, there was absolutely no concordance among the described alterations. And although total of 36 drugs were recommended for the eight patients, only nine (24%) of these drugs were recommended for the same patients by both platforms. Notably, in five patients (more than 50%), there was no overlap whatsoever between the drugs recommended by the FoundationOne test and those recommended by the Guardant360 test. The researchers concluded that the output from genetic testing can differ markedly depending on which genetic test is applied. Furthermore, they stated that these findings are clinically relevant because both the FoundationOne and the Guardant360 tests are performed on thousands of cancer patients each year.

Although the study cited below was done on rats and not humans, there may indeed be good reason to make your bedroom as dark as possible.  Also, it may be helpful to discuss the possibility of melatonin supplementation at night with your doctor. From: http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-07/aafc-etd072214.php \" For rats bearing human breast tumors, exposure to dim light at night made the tumors resistant to the breast cancer drug tamoxifen, according to data published in Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. The negative effects of dim light exposure on tamoxifen treatment were overcome by giving rats a melatonin supplement during the night. \"Resistance to tamoxifen is a growing problem among patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer,\" said Steven M. Hill, PhD, professor of structural and cellular biology and the Edmond and Lily Safra chair for breast cancer research at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans. \"Our data, although they were generated in rats, have potential implications for the large number of patients with breast cancer who are being treated with tamoxifen, because they suggest that nighttime exposure to light, even dim light, could cause their tumors to become resistant to the drug by suppressing melatonin production. \"Our study does not identify how much light exposure is needed to suppress nighttime melatonin production, and potentially drive tamoxifen resistance in humans, but we think that it could be as a little as the amount of light that comes in the bedroom window from a street light,\" continued Hill, who is also director of the Tulane Center for Circadian Biology. \"We are working toward conducting the studies that will answer this question. \"Although melatonin supplements are readily available over the counter at most drug and health-food stores, our research is not at a point where we can make a general recommendation that breast cancer patients taking tamoxifen should go out and buy melatonin,\" Hill added. \"Melatonin is produced by our bodies at a very specific time of day, exclusively during darkness at night, and taking melatonin supplements at the wrong time of day would potentially disrupt the circadian system, particularly the natural melatonin cycle, which may, in itself, paradoxically impair breast cancer responsiveness to tamoxifen.\" For the study, Hill and colleagues analyzed rats living in either normal light/dark conditions, with 12 hours of light followed by 12 hours of complete darkness, or conditions in which there were 12 hours of normal light followed by 12 hours of dim light. Melatonin levels in the blood of rats living in normal light/dark conditions rose during the dark period before decreasing again during the light period. In rats living in the dim night light conditions, melatonin levels remained low throughout the light/dark cycle. Tumor growth in rats living in the dim night light conditions was 2.6-fold faster compared with tumor growth in rats living in normal light/dark conditions. In addition, tumors in rats living in dim night light conditions were completely resistant to tamoxifen, whereas tumors in rats living in normal light/dark conditions regressed significantly. If rats living in dim night light conditions were given a nighttime melatonin supplement, their tumors regressed. Dx 10/6/2011, IDC, Left, Stage IV, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Below is a writeup about it from my MBC Guide, along with helpful links. I hope you begin to feel much better very soon! Palliative care is meant to help anyone with a serious illness. It differs from hospice care in that the patient can continue to receive standard treatment for their condition while on palliative care.Patients can request it at any age and any stage of an illness (even upon diagnosis), and it can be used along with curative treatment.Palliative care is not dependent on prognosis.With palliative care, patients can expect to have more control over their care, along with a comfortable and supportive atmosphere that reduces anxiety and stress.The patient's condition and situation are reviewed regularly by their palliative care team, and they are discussed with the patient to make sure that the patient's needs and wishes are being met and that treatments are in line with the patient's goals. Palliative care can reduce symptoms such as pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, constipation, nausea, loss of appetite and difficulty sleeping.It addresses the whole person and helps them to carry on with daily life.It can improve one's ability to go through medical treatments and help the patient to better understand their condition and choices for medical care. In short, it enhances the patient's Quality Of Life (QOL). Therefore, patients may wish to start palliative care early for best results, and they should request it from their doctor instead of waiting for their medical team to bring it up. Most insurance plans, including Medicare and Medicaid, cover all or part of palliative care treatment.Palliative care is generally available in a number of places including hospitals, outpatient clinics, long-term-care facilities, hospices, or home.Usually a team of specialists, including palliative care doctors, nurses and social workers, provide this type of care in conjunction with the patient's doctor.Massage therapists, pharmacists, nutritionists and others might also be part of the team.To obtain palliative care in order to manage cancer or treatment side effects, the patient should speak with her or his doctor or nurse. Alternatively, patients can look up Palliative Care providers in their area at: http://getpalliativecare.org/providers/ From:http://getpalliativecare.org/whatis/faq/#what-is-the-difference-between-hospice-and-palliative-care and http://www.choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Palliative-Care-Support-at-any-time-during-a-serious-illness.pdf ",

There are some aspects I hadn't previously considered, and as a result, I'm thinking of adding the following paragraphs to my Insider's Guide which reflect multiple concerns and approaches. Any suggestions or additional feedback are appreciated! Disease monitoring for progression can be stressful on MBC patients, since it frequently causes anxiety (often referred to as \"scanxiety\"). According to Dr. Accordino, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, there are data showing that finding progression immediately when it occurs is not associated with better patient outcomes. Furthermore, doctors may order tumor marker tests and then not do anything with the results - they still order scans on the same schedule they would otherwise have used. So the question is why the physician is putting the patient (if the patient is asymptomatic) through all these tests and giving them scanxiety if the physician is not going to change anything based on the information. From: https://www.onclive.com/web-exclusives/study-addresses-breast-cancer-monitoring-burden-on-metastatic-patients?p=1 Depending upon the type (if any) of medical coverage, tests can be expensive for the patient.Furthermore, certain types of scans expose the patient to radiation, and they can be detrimental to specific organs.Two examples are Contrast Induced Nephropathy (CIN) which is a kidney disorder that occurs in about 2% of patients who undergo CT scans or angiograms that use contrast dyes, and Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) which is a rare but serious disease affecting skin and other organs that has been found in some patients with advanced chronic kidney disease after exposure to gadolinium-containing contrast dyes that are used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). When the author solicited patients' opinions about the above, one patient responded that although she had been asymptomatic, she underwent regular scans, one of which revealed a few new spots of metastasis in her bones which were subsequently radiated.She stated that even if the measures did not stop further progression, the radiation may have averted deterioration in the bone and possibly prevented bone pain.She also raised the possibility that the new spots may have been comprised of newly-mutated cancer that the radiation prevented from spreading any further.Another patient responded that her friend's doctor scanned her every three months and would change her treatment every time a scan showed the slightest progression. As a result she has run through almost every option in a very short time and now regrets it. Given the above perspectives, patients should carefully discuss with their medical teams the types of scans they should undergo and the frequency with which they should occur - while weighing the pros and cons of various options.These decisions will need to be revisited if and when the patient's status changes.

Disease monitoring for progression can be stressful on MBC patients, as it frequently causes anxiety and discomfort (often referred to as \"scanxiety\"). According to Dr. Accordino, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, there are data showing that finding progression immediately when it occurs is not associated with better patient outcomes. Furthermore, doctors may order tumor marker tests and then not do anything with the results - they still order scans on the same schedule they would otherwise have used. So why is the physician putting the patient (if the patient is asymptomatic) through all these tests and giving them scanxiety if the physician is not going to change anything based on the information? Dr. Accordino also stated that doctors should be mindful that these interventions, which make it easy for them to \"check off boxes,\" can have a considerable adverse impact on the patient. There is also a significant cost associated with these tests, which are sometimes passed to the patient.

When Kaption mentioned that she would like to see additional information regarding LM, I wanted to take this opportunity to provide the chapter about LM from my complimentary MBC Guide. The 130+ page booklet can be requested by visiting: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/831507?page=3#idx_73 Breast Cancer Brain Metastasis (BCBM) and Leptomeningeal Metastasis (LM), which is also known as Carcinomatous Meningitis, are the two types of Central Nervous System (CNS) metastasis.Symptoms of LM may include headache, backache, loss of sensation in the face (especially the chin), loss of bladder or bowel control, constipation, dizziness, extreme fatigue, confusion, weakness or loss of sensation in the legs and inner thighs, vision problems and/or hearing difficulties.Elevated CerebroSpinal Fluid (CSF) pressure, white blood count, and protein levels, and lowered glucose levels can also be signs of LM.Some patients with LM have no symptoms at all. CNS metastasis is more common in the following MBC patient populations than in other MBC patients, so these patients should be especially vigilant about reporting any symptoms described above to their doctor: From: http://www.ascopost.com/issues/march-15,-2014/how-to-approach-the-problem-of-cns-metastasis-in-her2-positive-patients.aspx and http://www.cancernetwork.com/oncology-journal/management-breast-cancer-brain-metastases-moving-forward-new-options-are-still-needed and http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/8/4/r36 LM occurs when breast cancer spreads to the meninges, which are layers of tissue that cover the brain and the spinal cord.Metastases can spread to the meninges through the blood or they can travel from brain metastases via the cerebrospinal fluid that flows through the meninges.About 2% to 5% of patients with metastatic breast cancer experience LM. Although LM usually occurs at a later stage in the course of metastatic breast cancer, in very rare instances, it can occur as a first metastasis.LM is difficult to treat because many drugs are not able to penetrate from the bloodstream through the meninges into the cerebrospinal fluid. Often brain metastasis and LM occur at the same time. For that reason, women diagnosed with LM should also have an MRI of the brain.From: http://brainmetsbc.org/en/content/leptomeningeal-metastases-1 LM can be difficult to diagnose. The most common method is by withdrawing spinal fluid with a needle and examining it for breast cancer cells.This procedure is called a spinal tap or lumbar puncture.If the first lumbar puncture comes out negative, it must be repeated two more times to assure a 90% chance of an accurate diagnosis.Doing one puncture only assures a 45% accuracy.It is important that the lumbar puncture be close to the site of the suspected area of leptomeningeal metastasis.An MRI with gadolinium (a contrast agent) of the entire brain and spine can also be used to diagnosis LM and may be better than a CT scan.An MRI with a radioactive tracer can also be used to locate obstructions in the spinal fluid or blood flow caused by LM.However, on an MRI, inflammatory disease or local infection can sometimes be mistaken for LM.From: http://brainmetsbc.org/en/content/leptomeningeal-metastases-1 Once LM is diagnosed, it is important to check: The information below focuses on medications to treat LM.In addition to drugs, palliative radiotherapy can be used with Intrathecal or intravenous chemotherapy.From:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623833/ Unfortunately, there currently is no agreed-upon standard treatment LM. Sometimes the benefits of treatment are offset by treatment side effects.Especially if there is uncontrollable disease in other organs, treating symptoms of the disease but not the disease itself may be the best option. Drug Delivery options for leptomeningeal metastasis Depending on the therapy, drug delivery may be provided as follows: Interestingly, one mbc patient indicated that because her doctor had worked at a Children's Hospital, he was versed in using childrens' ports and provided her with a pediatric Ommaya port, which she said is more comfortable than the adult version. There is no direct evidence that IntraThecal (IT) chemotherapy, which is introduced directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, is better than intravenous chemotherapy, which is given through the veins. From: http://brainmetsbc.org/en/content/leptomeningeal-metastases-1 treatments for leptomeningeal metastasis LM drug options are varied, and may include the following drugs. Typically, Cytarabine, Herceptin, Methotrexate and Thiotepa are the most commonly used. Preservation of Memory with WBR:There is a type of WBR that is a \"hippocampus sparing procedure\" which may help to preserve a degree of memory that might otherwise be lost as a result of the procedure.In a study of 113 patients, at four months after undergoing the hippocampus sparing procedure, the decline in recall (as compared to baseline) was 7%, significantly better than the 30% cognitive decline in the historical control group that received WBR without thehippocampus sparing procedure.From:http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2014/10/21/JCO.2014.57.2909 ",

The objective is to collapse the pie as flat as possible (i.e. \"kill\" it). Molecular profiling and targeted therapy aim at one (or possibly two) specific ingredients (mutations) in the pie. For example, the targeted therapy may go after the nuts and puts them through a nut grinder. But although the nut part of the pie gets pulverized, the overall pie remains fairly firm. (NOTE: If the nuts had been a very \"active ingredient\" in the pie, this type of therapy might work well.  That said, some research has found that certain tumors contain specific mutations that may diminish the effectiveness of a molecular [targeted] therapy aimed at a particular genetic defect.  So to use this analogy, the presence of ice-cream for example, may gum up the nut grinder so that the nuts don\u2019t get pulverized). What Weisenthal does (and RT) in chemo sensitivity testing is that they try different ways to flatten the pie by taking sections of it and seeing what flattens the sections and what doesn't. They really don't care much about the contents of the pie - just that there's enough pie to be sectioned and tested.  First, they add sugar to a section but that doesn't work (the tumor/pie does not respond to the sugar \"chemo drug\"). Then they try heating a section - lo and behold, the ice cream, cheese, blueberries and cherries collapse, so the heating looks good as a therapy for flattening the pie (mind you, I'm using heat as an analogy for a specific type of chemo drug). Then they try taking a hammer to a section and - voila - the section gets flattened, so we know that the \"hammer\" chemo drug works well. And so on. For those who like to use visuals (and may also have a penchant for pie) I hope this helps.",

I hope your procedure will go smoothly and quickly! In case you may be interested, I've attached my notes about brain met therapies below.  I apologize for the long post. Sending best wishes for a great outcome!  chemotherapy.  A key issue regarding chemotherapy treatments is that few drugs are able to pass through the blood-brain barrier, although some drugs and combinations may work.  Additionally, boswellic acid may be helpful in reducing edema (swelling) and Emend may help reduce brain tumors.  More information is provided about these towards the end of this section. Gamma Knife, a specific form of Stereotactic Radiosurgery (\u201cSRS\u201d), is a radiosurgical treatment that delivers a dose of gamma radiation to the target with surgical precision.. A high dose of radiation is given to a target, usually a tumor, with minimal dose to the surrounding tissue. Ideally this dosage results in destruction of the tumor while sparing function of crucial organs or tissues adjacent to the treatment area, such as the optic nerve or brainstem. CyberKnife is also a form of SRS, andis a non-invasive alternative to surgery for the treatment of both cancerous and non-cancerous tumors anywhere in the body, including the prostate, lung, brain, spine, liver, pancreas and kidney. The treatment \u2013 which delivers high doses of radiation to tumors with extreme accuracy \u2013 offers hope to patients who have inoperable or surgically complex tumors, or who may be looking for a non-surgical option. The CyberKnife differs from the Gamma Knife by employing real-time X-ray images to guide treatment; and as a result has expanded SRS to sites outside the brain.  For more information about CyberKnife vs. Gamma Knife: http://www.swmedicalcenter.com/documents/cyberknife/oncologyissuesvol21no5.pdf Proton Therapy  A proton is a positively charged particle found in the nucleus of an atom. When protons interact with electrons in the atoms of cancer cells, they impart energy to the electrons, causing them to leave the atom and undergo a series of interactions (ionizing events) that result in damage to the DNA of the cancer cell. Damaging the DNA destroys specific cell functions, which include the ability to divide or proliferate. A cancer cell's ability to repair molecular injury is frequently inferior to that of cells in normal tissues. As a result, cancer cells accumulate permanent damage and subsequent cell death occurs. As the cell dies, so does the tumor. Traditional radiation therapy affects everything in its path, so doctors have to limit the dose delivered to the tumor in order to minimize damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Protons enter the body with a low dose of radiation, which increases when the beam slows down within the designated target tumor and then protons stop. Compared to an X-ray beam, a proton beam has a low \u201centrance dose\u201d (the dose delivered from the surface of the skin to the front of the tumor), a high dose designed to cover the entire tumor and no \u201cexit dose\u201d beyond the tumor. The combined effect is greater precision in targeting the tumor with a more potent dose of radiation. The accuracy of proton therapy for treatment delivery is within approximately one millimeter. Fromhttp://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/cancer-treatment/radiation/proton-therapy/index.html Whole Brain Radiation: (for mulltiple diffuse mets) Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is effective and the treatment of choice if there are many brain mets. Using MRI to examine the brain, about 80% of patients have more than one lesion. For patients with only a single brain lesion, SRS is a standard of care. For WBRT, standard dose-fractionation in the US is 3000 cGy in 10 treatments over 2 weeks, with one fraction given each day, 5 days a week. Multiple large studies have shown that this provides disease control in the brain for about half of people at 6 months (for many patients 6 months is longer than their survival, so in reality, more patients have disease control for their remaining lives). WBRT can be given instead of, or in addition to, SRS. From http://cancergrace.org/radiation/2008/07/30/wbrt-review/ Emend:  This is an anti-nausea drug that appears to help combat brain metastasis. From http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/257903.php Namenda is an Alzheimer's drug .that has been shown to help preserve cognitive skills after WBR; it may be worth discussing with your doctor. From: http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/111312/page3 To help relieve edema (swelling):  Boswellic Acid: One study showed that Boswellic acid may provide therapeutic relief to those who suffer from brain tumors. METHODS: Forty-four patients with primary or secondary malignant cerebral tumors were randomly assigned to radiotherapy plus either BS 4200 mg/day or placebo. The volume of cerebral edema in the T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence was analyzed as a primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were toxicity, cognitive function, quality of life, and the need for antiedematous (dexamethasone) medication. Blood samples were taken to analyze the serum concentration of boswellic acids (AKBA and KBA).  RESULTS: Compared with baseline and if measured immediately after the end of radiotherapy and BS/placebo treatment, a reduction of cerebral edema of >75% was found in 60% of patients receiving BS and in 26% of patients receiving placebo (P = .023). These findings may be based on an additional antitumor effect. There were no severe adverse events in either group. In the BS group, 6 patients reported minor gastrointestinal discomfort. BS did not have a significant impact on quality of life or cognitive function. The dexamethasone dose during radiotherapy in both groups was not statistically different. Boswellic acids could be detected in patients' serum.  CONCLUSIONS: BS significantly reduced cerebral edema measured by MRI in the study population. BS could potentially be steroid-sparing for patients receiving brain irradiation. From:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21287538  ",

That said, there may be some things that you can do to help regain your equilibrium, such as truly and fully celebrating your 50th!  For just one special day, make it a point to set everything else aside and instead focus on having a wonderful half century celebration! Subsequently, as Jen and others have mentioned, creating the Trust will help enable you to have peace of mind in lieu of that niggling feeling of having something important left to do. One thing that has helped work for me has been taking a bit of a break from the forums and focusing on taking a (solo) trip where I won't know anyone and will not have to make any decisions.  Sometimes simply a change in environment can lift one's spirits tremendously, and the planning helps divert one's attention! Finally, try to find and focus on one joy-filled thing per day, whether it's simply watching a bird feeding or gazing at a full moon.  Sending you - and all dear friends on bco - this flower from my pond to brighten your day!     ",

This is a wonderful place for receiving support, sharing information, and for asking questions.  Right now you're probably in a state of shock. But please know that as you and your doctor discuss treatment options and you begin your therapy, things will get better. In the event that you have a biopsy in the future, another thing to bear in mind is the possibility of sending the tumor for chemo sensitivity testing. This is still controversial and many doctors do not believe in it, but there have been some studies reflecting better results when the chemo that's administered is one that the test shows the tumor to be susceptible to. Two places I've heard good things about are Rational Therapeutics and the Weisenthal Center.

And your worry is understandable, but the good news is that there are many explanations for his symptoms, most of which are readily treatable. I know a bit about this because my husband suffered from anemia last year along with a multitude of other health-related issues. (I literally had to drag him out of a sequence of 8 significant health problems because he'd pretty much disengaged). Today, thankfully, he's back to his old self, but admittedly it was a hellish experience. Anemia can be caused by many things, and doubtless you've read up on them all, including folate and/or iron deficiency. In my husband's case, it turned out that the anemia was caused by chronic prostatitis; once his BPH and prostatitis were addressed, the anemia dissipated. Along with tests for folate and iron levels, your husband's inflammation markers should be tested via a C-Reactive Protein test because an internal inflammation can lead to anemia. Anemia can also be caused by medications and interactions, as we know all too well. I hope that things turn out exceedingly well, and that whatever is causing this is readily treatable. Meanwhile, I am so sorry you are dealing with this, as you've certainly had more than enough to contend with. Try to get out and do something with a friend if you can. Remaining in the house only leads to a diminishing volume of Lysol and an increasing amount of elbow grease. Sending you a big, warm, comforting hug! ",

Severe side effects occur in only 1-2% of those treated with radiosurgery. These include seizures, edema, hemorrhage, and radionecrosis (dead tumor tissue).  Radionecrosis from radiosurgery can be hard to distinguish from recurring brain metastasis.  Usually radionecrosis is treated with a corticosteroid, so sometimes surgery is necessary to biopsy the lesion to determine if it is, in fact, radionecrosis or recurring metastases. Radiosurgery can be repeated if new brain metastases appear, and it can also be used after regular surgery or WBRT as a \u201cboost\u201d to prevent brain metastases from recurring in the same location.  From:http://www.brainmetsbc.org/en/content/current-treatments-brain-metastasis Forms of Radiosurgery include: o  CyberKnife is a form of SRS.  It is a non-invasive alternative to surgery for the treatment of both cancerous and non-cancerous tumors anywhere in the body, including the head.  The treatment \u2013 which delivers beams of high dose radiation to tumors with extreme accuracy \u2013 offers new hope to patients worldwide.  The CyberKnife treatment involves no cutting and claims to be the world\u2019s first and only robotic radiosurgery system designed to treat tumors throughout the body non-invasively.  It provides a pain-free, non-surgical option for patients who have inoperable or surgically complex tumors, or who may be looking for an alternative to surgery. From:http://www.cyberknife.com/faq/index.aspx  The CyberKnife differs from the Gamma Knife (below) by employing real-time X-ray images to guide treatment; and as a result has expanded SRS to sites outside the brain.  It does not require a head frame screwed into the skull for immobilization, thus avoiding the pain, headache, nausea and risk of infection seen at times with stereotactic frames. Instead, a non-invasive thermoplastic head mask and image guidance allows stereotactic immobilization.  From:http://csn.cancer.org/node/189965 o  Gamma Knife is also a form of SRS.  It is a blade-free radiosurgical treatment that delivers a dose of gamma radiation to the target with surgical precision.  Gamma Knife radiosurgery delivers more than 200 precise radiation beams that converge deep within the brain to shrink or even destroy diseased or damaged tissue.  Alone, each of the beams contains harmless doses of radiation so surrounding tissue remains unaffected, protecting the important functions of the brain. From:http://www.pennmedicine.org/neurosurgery/patient-care/clinical-programs/gamma-knife/ ·  Whole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBR or WBRT): Whole brain radiation therapy is used for the treatment of multiple and larger brain metastases. It is also used for those patients with rapidly progressing metastatic disease outside of the brain and for what is known as \"poor performance status\" (ability to take care of oneself).  As its name indicates, radiation is delivered to the entire brain.  WBR has been shown in research studies to extend life and improve the quality of life for patients whose brain metastases are causing symptoms.  30% to 40% of patients will achieve a complete reversal of symptoms, while 75% to 85% of patients will experience some improvement or stabilization of their symptoms, especially headache and seizure.  From: http://www.brainmetsbc.org/en/content/current-treatments-brain-metastasis Preservation of Memory with WBR:  There is a type of WBR that is a \u201chippocampus sparing procedure\u201d which may help to preserve a degree of memory that might otherwise be lost as a result of the procedure.  In a study of 113 patients, at four months after undergoing the hippocampus sparing procedure, the decline in recall (as compared to baseline) was 7%, significantly better than the 30% cognitive decline in the historical control group that received WBR without the hippocampus sparing procedure.  From:  http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2014/10/21/JCO.2014.57.2909",

I have a friend who has had liver mets for 5 years and is still working full-time!  So although this is a difficult time, please hang in there!!!  Ablation an open surgical procedure by a surgeon who specializes in oncology. Ablation therapy consists of heating or cooling the liver tissue, or uses intense electric pulses, to achieve cancer cell death. A special probe is used to access the tumor and each specific method of treatment is delivered by the probe. Ablation is safe and is well tolerated. It is an effective treatment for patients with inoperable metastatic tumors but is limited by the size and number of tumors present.Ablation mechanisms include: Cryotherapy, NanoKnife, and Radio Frequency Ablation. Cryotherapyalso called cryosurgery, cryoablation, or targeted cryoablation therapy, uses the application of extreme cold to destroy the liver tumor. NanoKnife works by applying electrical energy directly into tumors and opening cell walls of the tumor. The cancer cells die; and the healthy tissue remains unharmed.  RadioFrequency Ablation:Pulses of radiofrequency energy are sent through a catheter (a long, thin tube) to heat and destroy diseased tissue. Currently, RFA is a standard treatment for patients with inoperable liver tumors.RFA may be used with other interventional cancer therapies, such as chemoembolization. Hepatic Arterial Infusion (\u201cHAI\u201d) Chemotherapy: HAI involves a drug delivery system that is implanted under the skin. A catheter from the pump is connected to the gastroduodenal artery, which joins the hepatic arteries, allowing the pump to infuse only the liver with chemotherapy. Radioembolization or SIRT Yttrium 90 Microspheres: SIRT is a relatively new treatment suitable for use even in patients with extensive liver involvement. Radioactive spheres (SIR-Spheres or Therasphere) are injected into an artery in the liver. The spheres are very tiny radioactive seeds. After they are injected through the liver artery, they travel into smaller arteries that feed the tumor. Once \"the little magic beads\" are in the tumor, they give off radiation for about three days. The radioactivity causes damage to cancer cells with little damage to the healthy liver tissue.  Note: Those who undergo SIRT should consider going on Xeloda since some studies show that Xeloda works very well with the Y90 and it is a double punching power. The Xeloda allegedly kick starts the radiation beats into overdrive. And Y-90 is a minimally invasive treatment that delivers cancer-killing radiation directly to tumors shows promise in treating breast cancer that has spread to the liver when no other treatment options remain. The outpatient treatment, called yttrium-90 (Y-90) radioembolization, was safe and provided disease stabilization in 98.5 percent of the women's treated liver tumors in a recent study.  From: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140324133234.htm Transarterial Chemoembolization (\u201cTACE\u201d): Chemoembolization is also known as TACE. In this technique an interventional radiologist injects a chemotherapeutic agent directly into the arteries supplying the tumors within the liver.

In short, it enhances the patient's Quality Of Life (QOL). Therefore, patients may wish to start palliative care early for best results, and they should request it from their doctor instead of waiting for their medical team to bring it up. Most insurance plans, including Medicare and Medicaid, cover all or part of palliative care treatment.Palliative care is generally available in a number of places including hospitals, outpatient clinics, long-term-care facilities, hospices, or home.Usually a team of specialists, including palliative care doctors, nurses and social workers, provide this type of care in conjunction with the patient's doctor.Massage therapists, pharmacists, nutritionists and others might also be part of the team.To obtain palliative care in order to manage cancer or treatment side effects, the patient should speak with her or his doctor or nurse.

I was wondering whether, if your tumor is biopsy-able or if you have malignant ascites or pleural effusion, you might consider sending a sample off for chemo sensitivity testing?  The tumor or malignant liquid would be tested against different chemos and combos to see what it may be susceptible to, and what it may be resistant to.  This is still considered controversial and many doctors do not believe in it, and it may not be covered by insurance. However, several people have indicated that it has helped them and that it was superior to the hit-or-miss approach to chemo that is used today.  If you are interested, two viable places are Rational Therapeutics http://www.rationaltherapeutics.com/  and Weisenthal. http://weisenthalcancer.com/Home.html  Dr. Weisenthal has been doing this since the 1990s, so he has extensive experience. Good luck on whatever you decide!",

Mark Hurwitz, MD, Director of Thermal Oncology for the Department of Radiation Oncology at Thomas Jefferson University and Hospital reported that the treatment, magnetic resonance image-guided focused ultrasound (MRIgFU) ablation therapy, significantly reduced pain in 67 percent of patients who received the treatment. The device, known as ExAblate, uses numerous small ultrasound beams designed to converge on a tumor within bone, heat it and destroy it. \u201cPain is a common, often debilitating symptom of the spread of cancer to bones. We are pleased to now have a second therapy that can improve a patient\u2019s enjoyment of life,\u201d says Dr. Hurwitz, who led the clinical trial. A number of cancers spread to bones, and a substantial proportion of patients live for years with these metastases, which can have a profound impact on a patient\u2019s quality of life, he adds. The findings of the trial led to approval of ExAblate last October by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as second-line therapy for palliation of painful metastatic bone tumors. The first-line therapy is typically radiotherapy. From: www.multivu.com/mnr/56632-insi...",

Despite her numerous and quite varied treatments, nothing seemed to work for very long. As a last-ditch possibility, she enrolled in an immunotherapy clinical trial which her loved ones and friends hoped would be somewhat effective - at least for a little while. Over time, it was clear that her tumors were receding (as corroborated both by touch [some tumors were close to the surface of her chest], and by scans). At present, they are pretty much gone! It's my understanding that, unfortunately, not everyone on the same trial fared as well.

You (and others) are welcome to request a complimentary copy of the 100+ page booklet by visiting:https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/8... In addition, although hospitals and companies are beginning to sequence patients' tumors in an attempt to personalize therapy, many are not sequencing each person's normal tissue to filter out noncancerous-related changes and to really understand what is occurring in the tumor. Personalized therapies designed to target the unique genetic changes that drive a person's tumor depend on accurate assessment of a tumor genome, but not all genetic changes in a cancer are directly related to the cancer. Some are germline changes, which are inherited changes in genes that are in normal tissues and differ from person to person. Only by comparing the genetic sequence of an individual's tumor with his/her own normal cells can clinicians begin to surmise which changes are more likely to be cancer-related and which treatments are likely to work.From: http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-04-tumor-only-g...

At the time of analysis, a total of 184 patients with four major solid cancer types: breast, lung, oesophageal, and colorectal, are enrolled. For patients with triple-negative breast cancer, 26% showed objective response to sacituzumab govitecan, with 2 having a complete disappearance of their tumors, or complete response, and 10 showing a 30% or better tumor reduction, which qualified them as partial responders. That said, I do not know how long it will take for the drug to be approved.  Normally it would need to go into a Phase II trial. May it be given G-dspeed.",

It is an FDA-approved drug (I think for Wilson's disease).  But insurance may or may not cover it for MBC (my guess would be not, but there may be exceptions!) If MBC clinical trials with the drug go well, then it potentially could be approved for MBC - and covered by insurance.  ",

The initial weeks and months after a mets diagnosis are the hardest. Dealing with the shock and fear can be very difficult. But as others have said, over time it gets a bit easier, and you'll find many people who are doing well with a good quality of life! Ensure that a cytology is run on the mets to see what their estrogen (ER), Progesterone (PR) and Her2 status are. Also ask to have them tested for Androgen receptors, as there are clinical trials now to suppress androgen much the way Tamoxifen suppresses estrogen. If your cancer is ER+ your oncologist should be considering hormonal treatment, and if it's Her2+ then Herceptin should be added. Please remember to keep copies of all tests results and scans in case you eventually want to have a second opinion from a specialist outside your medical network. Another idea is possibly sending a sample off for chemo sensitivity testing.  The tumor would be tested against different chemos and combos to see what it may be susceptible to, and what it may be resistant to.  This is still considered controversial and many doctors do not believe in it, and it may not be covered by insurance.  However,  several people have indicated that it has helped them and that it was superior to the hit-or-miss approach to chemo that is used today.  If you are interested, two viable places are Rational Therapeutics and Weisenthal. You may also want to seek a second opinion about your treatment. Please post if you have questions, and wishing you a great outcome from your treatment!",

With pleural effusion, the doctor can drain it periodically, or a catheter can be inserted for draining for a while (days or weeks) and later removed.  For persistent effusion, a talc procedure may be done but my understanding is that it is a bit painful at first.  Definitely ask the doc about how the effusion should be drained, how often,  and why s/he recommends what is being recommended.  Do not be afraid to ask questions.  Also, keep a copy of the medical records and test results so you have them readily at hand. As far as what you can do for her, take her lead.  Ask if there's anything she wants or needs, tell her how much you love her, accompany her to the doctor, and just be your loving self! ",

That said, many other factors come into play such as hormone receptor status, HER2 status, disease-free interval (DFI), co-morbidities and response to therapy. Below is a retrospective study regarding relative survival between the two populations: Three thousand five hundred and twenty-four women with de novo stage IV or relapsed breast cancer diagnosed from 1992 to 2007 were identified. Disease-free interval (DFI) was defined as the time from the diagnosis of primary nonmetastatic breast cancer to the date of the first distant metastases. Kaplan\u2013Meier product limit method was used to estimate overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to determine the association between metastatic disease (relapsed versus de novo) and OS after controlling for other patient/tumor characteristics. Results: Six hundred and forty-three (18.2%) women had de novo stage IV disease and 2881 (81.8%) had relapsed disease. Median follow-up was 19 months. Median OS among patients with de novo stage IV and relapsed disease was 39.2 and 27.2 months, respectively (P < 0.0001). In the multivariable model, women with relapsed disease had an increased risk of death compared with patients with de novo disease (HR = 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.47\u20132.08, P < 0.0001). When the multivariable model was stratified by DFI, women with relapsed disease with DFI <6 months, ≥6 months to <2 years, or ≥2 to <5 years each had a significantly higher risk of death compared with women with de novo stage IV disease. The risk of death was not statistically different among patients with relapsed disease with DFI >5 years compared with those with de novo disease.

TM can be procured via a doctor\u2019s prescription, and patients must be followed closely by a doctor when undertaking TM copper reduction. Patients\u2019 copper levels must be by the doctor both for copper levels and for anemia.  There are several compounding pharmacies that make TM, but it is an involved process which is a bit complicated. Below are my notes about it.  Wishing you the best, whatever you decide! Tetrathiomolybdate (TM), a Copper Reducing Drug: In a study of 29 patients with either stage 3 or stage 4 breast cancer who were NED (No Evidence of Disease) and who took the copper-reducing drug tetrathiomolybdate (TM), the progression-free survival rate has been 85% to date.  Additionally, in a very small study of 11 women with TNBC MBC (which is the most difficult MBC to treat), only two of 11 study participants relapsed within 10 months after using the anti-copper drug.  According to the researchers, copper is essential to the metastatic process.  Copper is a key component of enzymes that help turn on angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels, which is essential for tumors to grow) in the tumor microenvironment.  Copper also appears to play a role in directing cancer cell migration and invasion.  TM is a copper chelation compound (chelation involves the removal of heavy metals) that has been used to treat Wilson's disease, a hereditary copper metabolism disorder. As of January 2015, a Phase II study is underway for patients with MBC who are currently NED (No Evidence of Disease).  Hopefully more studies will follow.  From:  http://weill.cornell.edu/news/pr/2013/02/copper-depletion-therapy-keeps-high-risk-triple-negative-breast-cancer-at-bay.html",

      "Content": "Apr 12, 2014 05:29PM Bestbird wrote: As Carolyn and others have mentioned, there are additional options for liver mets besides chemo.  Below is some information about each for ease of reference. Wishing you a great outcome, whatever you decide!  Liver metastasis is commonly treated with chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy.  Other potential treatments include but are not limited to: Ablation an open surgical procedure by a surgeon who specializes in oncology. Ablation therapy consists of heating or cooling the liver tissue, or uses intense electric pulses, to achieve cancer cell death. A special probe is used to access the tumor and each specific method of treatment is delivered by the probe. Ablation is safe and is well tolerated. It is an effective treatment for patients with inoperable metastatic tumors but is limited by the size and number of tumors present.Ablation mechanisms include: Cryotherapy, NanoKnife, and Radio Frequency Ablation. Cryotherapyalso called cryosurgery, cryoablation, or targeted cryoablation therapy, uses the application of extreme cold to destroy the liver tumor. NanoKnife works by applying electrical energy directly into tumors and opening cell walls of the tumor. The cancer cells die; and the healthy tissue remains unharmed.  RadioFrequency Ablation:Pulses of radiofrequency energy are sent through a catheter (a long, thin tube) to heat and destroy diseased tissue. Currently, RFA is a standard treatment for patients with inoperable liver tumors.RFA may be used with other interventional cancer therapies, such as chemoembolization. Hepatic Arterial Infusion (\u201cHAI\u201d) Chemotherapy: HAI involves a drug delivery system that is implanted under the skin. A catheter from the pump is connected to the gastroduodenal artery, which joins the hepatic arteries, allowing the pump to infuse only the liver with chemotherapy. Radioembolization or SIRT Yttrium 90 Microspheres: SIRT is a relatively new treatment suitable for use even in patients with extensive liver involvement. Radioactive spheres (SIR-Spheres or Therasphere) are injected into an artery in the liver. The spheres are very tiny radioactive seeds. After they are injected through the liver artery, they travel into smaller arteries that feed the tumor. Once \"the little magic beads\" are in the tumor, they give off radiation for about three days. The radioactivity causes damage to cancer cells with little damage to the healthy liver tissue.  Note: Those who undergo SIRT should consider going on Xeloda since some studies show that Xeloda works very well with the Y90 and it is a double punching power. The Xeloda allegedly kick starts the radiation beats into overdrive. And Y-90 is a minimally invasive treatment that delivers cancer-killing radiation directly to tumors shows promise in treating breast cancer that has spread to the liver when no other treatment options remain. The outpatient treatment, called yttrium-90 (Y-90) radioembolization, was safe and provided disease stabilization in 98.5 percent of the women's treated liver tumors in a recent study.  From: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140324133234.htm Transarterial Chemoembolization (\u201cTACE\u201d): Chemoembolization is also known as TACE. In this technique an interventional radiologist injects a chemotherapeutic agent directly into the arteries supplying the tumors within the liver. The above therapies have been extracted from beatlivertumors.org/Liver_Dire...   ",

I hope you have a program from your medical team regarding the seizures.  Not only are seizures terribly disconcerting, but unfortunately they can have an impact (such as your poor tongue getting the brunt)!  Please make sure your oncologist and any other doctors are coordinating your overall care.

Oddly enough, before my Stage IV diagnosis, I thought my coughing and shortness of breath had been caused by reflux and purchased a \"wedge\" pillow from a place called Medslant to alleviate the symptoms.  Although as it turns out my problem was mets to the lung, not reflux, I found to my pleasant surprise that the pillow is really comfortable for me.  Sometimes finding the right pillow can make a huge difference in one's comfort and depth of sleep.   Finally, please know you're not alone in feeling distracted in your day to day routine!  I can't tell you how many bloopers I've made - fortunately my parrot hasn't as yet ended up in the soup pot! :) Hugs, - Anne ",

Many people with TNBC may respond well to platinum chemotherapy drugs.  Myriad Genetics has recently derived a test to predict which people will respond better to platinum-based drugs.Furthermore,the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), a type of white blood cell, ahead of treatment may help predict response to platinum-based chemotherapy in women with triple-negative breast cancerFrom: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/270261.php and http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/276870.php Also, you may want to obtain a second opinion about your test results and therapy.

The following drug guidelines for HER2 Positive MBC therapies were established by ASCO in 2014: First-line  therapy: First line therapy for HER2+ MBC patients should consist of Herceptin, Perjeta and a Taxane chemotherapy.  For select patients \u2013 those with  contraindications and/or slow growing hormone receptor-positive cancer \u2013  hormonal therapy administered either with or without either Herceptin or  Tykerb may be substituted for a chemotherapy-based HER2 targeted regimen  because there are usually fewer side effects.  However, hormonal therapy is not  appropriate for all patients with advanced, hormone receptor-positive  breast cancer since it has not been associated with a survival benefit in  this setting.  From:http://www.instituteforquality.org/systemic-therapy-patients-advanced-human-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor-2%E2%80%93positive-breast-cancer  Second-line therapy should be Kadcyla  (TDM-1) Third-line therapy: Treatment depends on what patients received as first-and second-line therapies.  Options may include Kadcyla, hormonal therapy or chemotherapy with Herceptin and in some cases with Tykerb, the combination of Herceptin and Tykerb, or a Perjeta-based regimen if the patient has not received Perjeta beforehand. From:http://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/practice-management/news/online/%7B33ca3c9d-e260-4a90-9039-8952f7f09714%7D/asco-issues-guidelines-for-advanced-HER2positive-breast-cancer Optimal duration of chemotherapy is at least 4 to 6 months or until maximum response, depending on toxicity and in the  absence of progression. The rationale for adding Perjeta to Herceptin is that a study found that HER2+ MBC patients whowere given Perjeta on top of Herceptin and chemotherapy lived 15.7 months longer than those on Herceptin and chemotherapy alone.  That is the longest extension to survival ever seen for a drug studied in metastatic breast cancer!  ",

      "Content": "Feb 12, 2015 08:50PM Bestbird wrote: When tumors on the lung were found on a CT scan, I underwent VATS surgery so that they could be biopsied.  The biopsied material is tested by a pathology lab to determine whether it is cancer, and if so, what type.  If it is bc, then it will provide an ER, PR and HER2 status. The VATS procedure was not terribly painful, but it is tricky and I was in the hospital for five days, which is generally the case.  If you decide to have it, please find an experienced thoracic surgeon, especially one who works frequently with cancer of the lung. Here's a bit more information about the VATS Procedure: Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is a type of surgery that enables doctors to view the inside of the chest cavity after making only very small incisions. The doctor can examine the outside surface of the lung and the inner surface of the chest wall through a camera attached to the scope. Abnormal appearing areas on the lung surface can be biopsied. VATS also provides relatively easy access to taking a biopsy of the lung. Also, if you have only one lesion, I'd encourage you to find out if you may get removed in entirety.  If you have only one lesion and no other organs are involved, you classify as Oligometastatic, which is a small group of mbc patients who - believe it or not - may be potentially curable.  More information below:  OligoMetastasis (OM) in breast cancer is usually characterized by a solitary lesion or a few detectable lesions (tumors).  These lesions are generally limited to a single organ, in which local therapy (possibly along with systemic therapy) with curative intent could impact survival in a positive manner. This population of \u201cpotentially curable\u201d MBC patients is estimated to represent 1% to-10% of newly diagnosed patients with MBC.  One interesting study involved patients with a single organ or 2 organs  involved.  In those cases where effects of systemic therapy, possibly in combination with other treatments, were evaluated, a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) was achieved in 48.5% or 47.1% of cases respectively, with an outstanding overall response rate of 95.6%. Medians estimated were: Overall Survival (OS) of 185.0 months, and relapse-free interval (RFI) of 48.0 months. Three cases (4%) survived for their lifetime without relapse after achieving NED, the definition of clinical cure. This study indicates that OM is a distinct group of patients with long-term prognosis superior to MBC, with reasonable provability for clinical cure. Further prospective studies to better characterize OM are warranted.  From:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22532161",

Below is some information that may be helpful in finalizing a decision: Sending very best wishes! When breast cancer spreads to the liver or elsewhere in the body \u2013 especially when a new organ becomes involved - it is recommended that the tumor(s) be biopsied to re-check the cancer\u2019s ER, PR and HER2 profile. The rationale for this suggestion is based upon a retrospective analysis of 1,250 ultrasound-guided liver biopsies carried out at the European Institute of Oncology from August 1999 to March 2009. The analysis studied ER, PR and HER2 status in 255 patients with matched primary and liver tissue samples.  Changes in ER status were observed in 37 (14.5%) of 255 patients Changes in PR status were observed in 124 (48.6%) of 255 patients Changes in HER2 status were observed in 24 (13.9%) of 172 evaluable patients Hence, the study observed discordance in receptor status (ER, PR, and HER2) between primary tumor and liver metastasis, which led to change in therapy for 31 (12.1%) of 255 of patients.

In addition, below are a few tips for those who are newly diagnosed. I hope you do well for decades to come! If it's possible, have the met(s) biopsied to see what their estrogen (ER), Progesterone (PR) and HER2 status are, since they may differ from the original cancer (if you were previously diagnosed). If the cancer is ER+ and/or PR+, then the oncologist should be considering hormonal treatment, and if it's HER2+ then Herceptin and Perjeta may be considered along with a Taxane. Additionally, you may want to request testing to see whether the tumor has Androgen Receptors (AR), since there are some promising clinical trials that target Androgen Receptors in a similar manner as current hormonal therapy targets Estrogen Receptors (ER). Even if you are hormone receptor negative (ER- and PR-) you may still consider hormonal therapy according to the latest (2014) National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, \"Patients may be candidates for hormonal therapy irrespective of their hormone receptivity status, provided that their cancer is in the bones, soft tissue (muscle, fat or nerves), or internal organs and is not causing symptoms. The reason for suggesting hormonal therapy is because sometimes the metastasis is indeed hormone receptor positive and the actual test results are incorrect. (This represents a major shift in thinking regarding potential therapies for TNBC and hormone receptor negative patients). From: http://www.nccn.org/patients/guidelines/stage_iv_breast/index.html#33/z This is very important: Please remember to keep copies of all tests results and scans in case there eventually is a need or desire to have a second opinion from a specialist outside your medical network. You may also want to seek a second opinion at any point about treatment.  Two published books which you may want to read are: \"Anti Cancer: A New Way of Life\" by Dr. David Servain-Schreiber.The author, an MD, was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor which he survived for nearly 20 years by following the science-based principles described in his book.It contains excellent information about diet and supplements, as well as emotional well-being. \"Life Over Cancer\" by Dr. Keith Block, an expert in integrative oncology who combines cutting-edge conventional treatment with individualized and scientifically-based complementary therapies.This book is an excellent resource for those who are interested in combining conventional and complementary therapies. Please post if you have questions, and wishing you a great outcome! ",

In the MBC Guide, there's mention of the supplement in several places, and there has been study of the supplement in humans with bc. In a study of 150 \"solid tumor\" patients (including breast cancer patients), the 1-year survival rate and the objective tumor regression rate were significantly higher in patients concomitantly treated with melatonin and chemotherapy than in those who received chemotherapy alone. In addition, the simultaneous administration of melatonin was found to significantly reduce the frequency of low platelet counts, neurotoxicity, heart damage, sores, and fatigue.Therefore, this study suggested that melatonin may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy and reduce its toxicity, at least in advanced cancer patients of poor clinical status.The positive cancer prevention capabilities of melatonin are believed to be at their strongest when taken at night. Thus, it may be beneficial for chemotherapeutic drugs to be given at night along with melatonin, thereby maximizing the effect of both types of drugs.From:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10674014 In another study, 14 MBC ER+ patients who were unresponsive to Tamoxifen alone were given 20 mg melatonin daily in the evening along with Tamoxifen.A response was achieved in 28% of these patients.

In the dose escalation part of the trial, safety and efficacy of SYD985 will be evaluated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors of any origin. In the expanded cohort part of the trial, only patients with breast and gastric cancer will be enrolled. The expanded cohorts will include patients currently indicated for HER2-targeted treatment as well as patients with HER2 2+ and HER2 1+ breast cancer for whom there currently is no effective anti-HER2 therapy available. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo findings in a head-to-head comparison of SYD985 and T-DM1 In vitro, SYD985 and T-DM1 (Kadcyla®) were studied in a panel of eight cell lines expressing different levels of HER2. In cell lines with high HER2 expression (characterized as HER2 3+) SYD985 and T-DM1 showed similar potencies. However, in cell lines with low or moderate HER2 expression (characterized as HER2 1+ and HER2 2+), SYD985 was substantially more potent than T-DM1. In vivo anti-tumor activity was assessed in a series of xenograft models using tumor cell lines and patient-derived breast-cancer tissues with varying HER2 expression levels (HER2 3+, HER2 2+ and HER2 1+).  (Note that Her21+ is considered to be Her2 Negative). Both SYD985 and T-DM1 showed anti-tumor activity in the HER2 3+ models. SYD985 demonstrated very potent anti-tumor activity in the FISH-negative models that were either HER2 2+ or HER2 1+, contrary to T-DM1 which was completely inactive. In these moderate- or low-expressing HER2 tumor models, SYD985 was even able to induce complete tumor remission after a single dose of 3 mg/kg. First patients for this trial are being enrolled in leading European oncology centers Radboud University Medical Center (Nijmegen, the Netherlands), the Jules Bordet Institute (Brussels, Belgium) and the Institute of Cancer Research at The Royal Marsden Hospital (London, United Kingdom). The trial will recruit at least 76 patients and more centers are expected to join the trial in 2015.

It works by gravity rather than suction when you drain, so it may be a little more comfortable. When we drained the fluid with the Pleurx catheter, I slightly pinched the clasp that fits around the draining tube to slow down the draining process, which made it more comfortable, and I never felt uncomfortable while draining. At first we had a home health nurse do the draining, and she taught my husband and me how to drain it so that we could do it independently. Normally the catheter is fairly unobtrusive - you just need to make sure your skin doesn't get irritated around the incision, and be careful about keeping it fairly dry when showering (may Saran Wrap be praised!) Connis, some patients I know have had the pleurodesis (talc procedure) and there are pros and cons. The pros are that it can help seal (and dry) the area permanently, the material inserted can in itself be cancer-fighting, and it's a one-time procedure. The cons are that it generally requires an overnight hospital stay, sometimes the outcome of the procedure doesn't work, and the worst case scenario is that it can in rare instances cause complications and pain for months, although that is fairly rare. Wishing you both a great outcome!",

Bisphosphonates can also reduce the number of new bone mets that develop and lower high levels of calcium in the blood.  Zoledronic acid (Zometa), a bisphosphonate commonly given for bone mets, is taken by vein about once a month. Others include pamidronatedisodium (Aredia), another IV treatment, and clodronate (Bonefos), given as a pill.  Denosumab (Xgeva) is a newer bone treatment given as an injection that has been shown to work a bit better than zoledronic acid in treating bone pain and delaying SREs [Skeletal Related Events].

If a SERM is sitting in the estrogen receptor, there is no room for estrogen and it can't attach to the cell. If estrogen isn't attached to a breast cell, the cell doesn't receive estrogen's signals to grow and multiply.",

Phase I clinical trials for MBC and a few other cancers are taking place in MD, TX, and WI. Experimental Drug Based on Plant Toxin Targets and Kills Tumor Cells ...  URL at http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/071012/page3#c Researchers have engineered a drug that can deliver a potent cell-killing toxin to tumors while largely sparing normal tissues. The drug, known as G202, shrank xenograft tumors of several human cancers in mice, including prostate, breast, kidney, and bladder cancer, and had relatively few toxic effects. On the basis of these findings, reported June 27 in Science Translational Medicine, researchers have initiated an early-phase clinical trial of G202 in patients with advanced cancer. G202 delivers its toxic payload-a potent analog of the plant substance thapsigargin-to tumors by binding specifically to a protein known as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). PSMA is found in high levels in most prostate cancers. It is also found in tumor endothelial cells, which line blood vessels in a variety of solid tumors but not in normal endothelial cells. PSMA is an enzyme that spans the cell membrane and can cut proteins in specific places. Researchers designed G202 so that it not only binds to PSMA but is also a target for PSMA's protein-cutting activity. G202 is an inactive \"prodrug,\" and PSMA causes the release of the active, cell-killing thapsigargin analog from the prodrug form. This release takes place outside the cell, in the tumor microenvironment. Once released, the thapsigargin analog is taken up by nearby tumor cells, where it inhibits a protein known as the SERCA pump. Shutting down the SERCA pump floods the cell with calcium and triggers programmed cell death. Unlike commonly used chemotherapy drugs, which typically work by killing rapidly dividing cells, \"[thapsigargin] and its analogs can kill both rapidly proliferating and nonproliferating cells with equal potency,\" wrote Drs. Samuel Denmeade and John Isaacs of Johns Hopkins University and their colleagues. This ability, they noted, makes a thapsigargin-based drug particularly suitable for treating prostate cancer because most cancer cells in metastatic prostate cancer are not dividing. Safety studies of G202 that are required before the drug can be tested in humans showed that it caused transient reversible kidney toxicity in rats and monkeys. G202 did not cause bone marrow toxicity-a common side effect of traditional cell-killing chemotherapy-in mice, rats, or monkeys.

That said, I've been in touch with Dr. Nick Wagle (who is leading the project) and Corrie Painter, who is working with him, regarding our survey results. I hope that they will take additional factors into account regarding exceptional response, such a supplements, lifestyle, the microenvironment, and the microbiome. MusicLover, thank you for remembering our Exceptional Responder survey! For purposes of this study: Exceptional Responders were people with mbc who have - at one point or another - been on the same medication for three years or more and whose disease remained either stable, decreased, or became NED while on it. Outliers were patients who have survived mbc for 6 or more years. The survey contained the following 7 questions (please note; I am no longer conducting this survey, which was completed earlier this year): 1) Whether you're an Exceptional Responder, Outlier, or both 2) Year your mbc was diagnosed 3) Your cancer's ER, PR and HER2 profile 4) List of drugs/treatments (with from and to dates, as best you know them) for each drug taken 5) Any additional therapies (conventional or otherwise) you may have had or are taking (i.e. acupuncture, specific supplements, etc.) 6) Whether your tumor(s) had been tested via a chemo sensitivity test or for molecular/genetic profiling, and if so, what specific treatment(s) you took as a result 7) Your \"gut feel\" as to why you've done relatively well compared to others For those who may not have seen them, the survey results were posted near the top of this page: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/...

Your input is deeply appreciated, irrespective of whether \"journey\" or other terms disturb you.  And thank you to the Mods for reaching out to gain better understanding of how we perceive allusions to ourselves and our condition. I'd welcome your opinion about something that might potentially be actionable as a result of this discussion:  Perhaps it might be worthwhile to reach out to the newly-formed Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance - and potentially to other mbc-related organizations  to make them aware that a subset of the metastatic population may find certain terms offensive (journey, chronic, warrior, heroic, battle, fight) and to kindly exercise sensitivity when describing the disease and the people who are diagnosed with it. So for example, when referring to someone who has passed on, instead of: \"This brave warrior fought a heroic battle throughout her breast cancer journey.\"  they could write something like \"Until she was no longer able to do so, she dealt with with the formidable and painful challenges relentlessly presented by the incurable disease called metastatic breast cancer.\"  And ideally  they could avoid using the sensitive words in their literature.  I realize that not everyone cares about terminology. But for those that do (and for the population at large), words that undermine our situation represent yet another version of pink- washing.   ",

      "Content": "Mar 15, 2014 03:44AM Bestbird wrote: My friend had WBR several years ago and is still going strong, and an acquaintance had Gamma Knife two years ago and looks great and is working full time!  Below are my notes on brain mets; please accept my apologies for the length of this post. Wishing you a great outcome!  Brain metastasis is usually treated with Cyberknife, Gamma Knife, Proton Therapy, Whole Brain Radiation (\u201cWBR\u201d) and/or possibly chemotherapy.  A key issue regarding chemotherapy treatments is that few drugs are able to pass through the blood-brain barrier, although some drugs and combinations may work.  Additionally, boswellic acid may be helpful in reducing edema (swelling) and Emend may help reduce brain tumors.  More information is provided about these towards the end of this section. Gamma Knife, a specific form of Stereotactic Radiosurgery (\u201cSRS\u201d), is a radiosurgical treatment that delivers a dose of gamma radiation to the target with surgical precision.. A high dose of radiation is given to a target, usually a tumor, with minimal dose to the surrounding tissue. Ideally this dosage results in destruction of the tumor while sparing function of crucial organs or tissues adjacent to the treatment area, such as the optic nerve or brainstem. CyberKnife is also a form of SRS, andis a non-invasive alternative to surgery for the treatment of both cancerous and non-cancerous tumors anywhere in the body, including the prostate, lung, brain, spine, liver, pancreas and kidney. The treatment \u2013 which delivers high doses of radiation to tumors with extreme accuracy \u2013 offers hope to patients who have inoperable or surgically complex tumors, or who may be looking for a non-surgical option. The CyberKnife differs from the Gamma Knife by employing real-time X-ray images to guide treatment; and as a result has expanded SRS to sites outside the brain.  For more information about CyberKnife vs. Gamma Knife: http://www.swmedicalcenter.com/documents/cyberknife/oncologyissuesvol21no5.pdf Proton Therapy  A proton is a positively charged particle found in the nucleus of an atom. When protons interact with electrons in the atoms of cancer cells, they impart energy to the electrons, causing them to leave the atom and undergo a series of interactions (ionizing events) that result in damage to the DNA of the cancer cell. Damaging the DNA destroys specific cell functions, which include the ability to divide or proliferate. A cancer cell's ability to repair molecular injury is frequently inferior to that of cells in normal tissues. As a result, cancer cells accumulate permanent damage and subsequent cell death occurs. As the cell dies, so does the tumor. Traditional radiation therapy affects everything in its path, so doctors have to limit the dose delivered to the tumor in order to minimize damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Protons enter the body with a low dose of radiation, which increases when the beam slows down within the designated target tumor and then protons stop. Compared to an X-ray beam, a proton beam has a low \u201centrance dose\u201d (the dose delivered from the surface of the skin to the front of the tumor), a high dose designed to cover the entire tumor and no \u201cexit dose\u201d beyond the tumor. The combined effect is greater precision in targeting the tumor with a more potent dose of radiation. The accuracy of proton therapy for treatment delivery is within approximately one millimeter. Fromhttp://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/cancer-treatment/radiation/proton-therapy/index.html Whole Brain Radiation: Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is effective and the treatment of choice if there are many brain mets. Using MRI to examine the brain, about 80% of patients have more than one lesion. For patients with only a single brain lesion, SRS is a standard of care. For WBRT, standard dose-fractionation in the US is 3000 cGy in 10 treatments over 2 weeks, with one fraction given each day, 5 days a week. Multiple large studies have shown that this provides disease control in the brain for about half of people at 6 months (for many patients 6 months is longer than their survival, so in reality, more patients have disease control for their remaining lives). WBRT can be given instead of, or in addition to, SRS. From http://cancergrace.org/radiation/2008/07/30/wbrt-review/ Emend:  This is an anti-nausea drug that appears to help combat brain metastasis. From http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/257903.php Namenda is an Alzheimer's drug .that has been shown to help preserve cognitive skills after WBR; it may be worth discussing with your doctor. From: http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/111312/page3 To help relieve edema (swelling):  Boswellic Acid: One study showed that Boswellic acid may provide therapeutic relief to those who suffer from brain tumors. METHODS: Forty-four patients with primary or secondary malignant cerebral tumors were randomly assigned to radiotherapy plus either BS 4200 mg/day or placebo. The volume of cerebral edema in the T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence was analyzed as a primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were toxicity, cognitive function, quality of life, and the need for antiedematous (dexamethasone) medication. Blood samples were taken to analyze the serum concentration of boswellic acids (AKBA and KBA).  RESULTS: Compared with baseline and if measured immediately after the end of radiotherapy and BS/placebo treatment, a reduction of cerebral edema of >75% was found in 60% of patients receiving BS and in 26% of patients receiving placebo (P = .023). These findings may be based on an additional antitumor effect. There were no severe adverse events in either group. In the BS group, 6 patients reported minor gastrointestinal discomfort. BS did not have a significant impact on quality of life or cognitive function. The dexamethasone dose during radiotherapy in both groups was not statistically different. Boswellic acids could be detected in patients' serum.  CONCLUSIONS: BS significantly reduced cerebral edema measured by MRI in the study population. BS could potentially be steroid-sparing for patients receiving brain irradiation. From:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21287538  ",

You have good reason to question your doctor's decision, since generally hormonal therapies are used first (in sequence) for hormone receptor positive patients. That said, chemotherapy may be substituted if the patient is experiencing significant symptoms. Your doctor may feel that since two hormonal therapies have failed, and the tumor feels larger, that chemo may be called for. You may want to request a scan and also obtain a second opinion about your treatment. I hope that whatever you decide upon next works very well for you!

Learn more about \"The Insider's Guide to Metastatic Breast Cancer\" at: https://www.insidersguidembc.com/   You can order the paperback or eBook on Amazon, or download a complimentary .pdf via the ORDER page. The Guide contains information that many patients may not be aware of, such as: Hormone Receptor (HR) positive, HER2 negative premenopausal patients are now eligible to take a combination of Kisqali (Ribociclib) which is a CDK4/6 inhibitor, along with an Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) as initial endocrine-based therapy. BRCA positive, HER2 negative MBC patients have the option of taking the FDA-approved PARP inhibitors Olaparib or Talazoparib for their disease. Heavily pre-treated HER2+ MBC patients may be interested to hear that a Phase 3 study called \"SOPHIA\" showed that the experimental drug Margetuximab in combination with chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 24% compared with patients taking Herceptin and chemotherapy. Patients experiencing fatigue, anxiety, joint pain, and/or other quality of life issues can significantly be helped by acupuncture treatments based upon the results of scientific studies. If Xeloda or 5-FU have been prescribed as treatment, patients may first want to speak with their medical teams about getting tested for specific mutations in the DPD (dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase) gene that could cause a severely toxic or potentially life-threatening reaction.Approximately 3% to 5% of the population has some degree of DPD deficiency that can put them at risk when taking these drugs.

Below are treatment options for eye (ocular) mets as described in my MBC Therapies Guide.  You and others are welcome to request a complimentary copy of the 100 page booklet by visiting:  https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/831507?page=1#post_4391326 I hope your therapy works well for you! PhotoDynamic Therapy (PDT) is a treatment that uses special drugs, called \u201cphotosensitizing agents,\u201d along with light to kill cancer cells. The drugs only work after they have been activated or \u201cturned on\u201d by certain kinds of light. In one study, 9 metastases in 8 eyes were treated with PDT.  After PDT, complete control with resolution of sub retinal fluid was achieved in 7 tumors (78%), with mean tumor thickness reduction of 39%.  Two tumors failed to respond to PDT, both requiring plaque radiotherapy.   Plaque Brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy that delivers a highly concentrated radiation dose to the tumor with relatively less radiation to surrounding healthy tissues and takes only two days to complete, compared with daily radiation for four weeks with external beam radiation.  Plaque radiotherapy has proven effective in cases of solitary metastases and those that failed to respond favorably to external beam radiation. Most patients treated with radiation maintain good vision.  One doctor reported having a patient with very advanced MBC and 15 tumors in her eyes.  She was able to preserve 20/20 vision for the next 3 or 4 years. Proton or Charged Particle (Pencil Beam) Therapy: Traditional radiation therapy affects everything in its path, so doctors have to limit the dose delivered to the tumor in order to minimize damage to surrounding healthy tissue. In proton therapy, protons enter the body with a low dose of radiation which increases when the beam slows down within the tumor, and then the protons stop without going any further to harm further tissue. Compared to an X-ray beam, a proton beam has a low \u201centrance dose\u201d (the dose delivered from the surface of the skin to the front of the tumor), a high dose designed to cover the entire tumor, and no \u201cexit dose\u201d beyond the tumor.  The combined effect is claimed to provide greater precision in targeting the tumor with a more potent dose of radiation.  Radiation Therapy or Laser Surgery: Treatment for metastasis to the eye may include radiation therapy, although laser surgery may be used in some cases. External-beam radiation is a common treatment option, especially if there is multifocal involvement, but occasionally plaque brachytherapy (described above) is used if there is one tumor.  Systemic Therapy such as chemotherapy (especially a Taxane [Taxol, Taxotere, or Abraxane]), hormonal and/or targeted therapy may sometimes be helpful against ocular metastasis.  From:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22386261 and http://www.aao.org/publications/eyenet/200407/oncology.cfmand http://www.eyecancer.com/conditions-and-treatments/treatments/6/eye-and-vision-sparing-radiation-therapy-for-intraocular-tumorsand http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3574252/",

Brain metastasis is usually treated with Cyberknife, Gamma Knife, Proton Therapy, Whole Brain Radiation (\u201cWBR\u201d) and/or possibly chemotherapy.  A key issue regarding chemotherapy treatments is that few drugs are able to pass through the blood-brain barrier, although some drugs and combinations may work.  Additionally, boswellic acid may be helpful in reducing edema (swelling) and Emend may help reduce brain tumors.  More information is provided about these towards the end of this section. Gamma Knife, a specific form of Stereotactic Radiosurgery (\u201cSRS\u201d), is a radiosurgical treatment that delivers a dose of gamma radiation to the target with surgical precision.. A high dose of radiation is given to a target, usually a tumor, with minimal dose to the surrounding tissue. Ideally this dosage results in destruction of the tumor while sparing function of crucial organs or tissues adjacent to the treatment area, such as the optic nerve or brainstem. CyberKnife is also a form of SRS, andis a non-invasive alternative to surgery for the treatment of both cancerous and non-cancerous tumors anywhere in the body, including the prostate, lung, brain, spine, liver, pancreas and kidney. The treatment \u2013 which delivers high doses of radiation to tumors with extreme accuracy \u2013 offers hope to patients who have inoperable or surgically complex tumors, or who may be looking for a non-surgical option. The CyberKnife differs from the Gamma Knife by employing real-time X-ray images to guide treatment; and as a result has expanded SRS to sites outside the brain.  For more information about CyberKnife vs. Gamma Knife: http://www.swmedicalcenter.com/documents/cyberknife/oncologyissuesvol21no5.pdf Proton Therapy  A proton is a positively charged particle found in the nucleus of an atom. When protons interact with electrons in the atoms of cancer cells, they impart energy to the electrons, causing them to leave the atom and undergo a series of interactions (ionizing events) that result in damage to the DNA of the cancer cell. Damaging the DNA destroys specific cell functions, which include the ability to divide or proliferate. A cancer cell's ability to repair molecular injury is frequently inferior to that of cells in normal tissues. As a result, cancer cells accumulate permanent damage and subsequent cell death occurs. As the cell dies, so does the tumor. Traditional radiation therapy affects everything in its path, so doctors have to limit the dose delivered to the tumor in order to minimize damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Protons enter the body with a low dose of radiation, which increases when the beam slows down within the designated target tumor and then protons stop. Compared to an X-ray beam, a proton beam has a low \u201centrance dose\u201d (the dose delivered from the surface of the skin to the front of the tumor), a high dose designed to cover the entire tumor and no \u201cexit dose\u201d beyond the tumor. The combined effect is greater precision in targeting the tumor with a more potent dose of radiation. The accuracy of proton therapy for treatment delivery is within approximately one millimeter. Fromhttp://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/cancer-treatment/radiation/proton-therapy/index.html Whole Brain Radiation: Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is effective and the treatment of choice if there are many brain mets. Using MRI to examine the brain, about 80% of patients have more than one lesion. For patients with only a single brain lesion, SRS is a standard of care. For WBRT, standard dose-fractionation in the US is 3000 cGy in 10 treatments over 2 weeks, with one fraction given each day, 5 days a week. Multiple large studies have shown that this provides disease control in the brain for about half of people at 6 months (for many patients 6 months is longer than their survival, so in reality, more patients have disease control for their remaining lives). WBRT can be given instead of, or in addition to, SRS. From http://cancergrace.org/radiation/2008/07/30/wbrt-review/ Emend:  This is an anti-nausea drug that appears to help combat brain metastasis. From http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/257903.php Namenda is an Alzheimer's drug .that has been shown to help preserve cognitive skills after WBR; it may be worth discussing with your doctor. From: http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/111312/page3 To help relieve edema (swelling):  Boswellic Acid: One study showed that Boswellic acid may provide therapeutic relief to those who suffer from brain tumors. Forty-four patients with primary or secondary malignant cerebral tumors were randomly assigned to radiotherapy plus either BS 4200 mg/day or placebo. The volume of cerebral edema in the T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence was analyzed as a primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were toxicity, cognitive function, quality of life, and the need for antiedematous (dexamethasone) medication. Blood samples were taken to analyze the serum concentration of boswellic acids (AKBA and KBA).  RESULTS: Compared with baseline and if measured immediately after the end of radiotherapy and BS/placebo treatment, a reduction of cerebral edema of >75% was found in 60% of patients receiving BS and in 26% of patients receiving placebo (P = .023). These findings may be based on an additional antitumor effect. There were no severe adverse events in either group. In the BS group, 6 patients reported minor gastrointestinal discomfort. BS did not have a significant impact on quality of life or cognitive function. The dexamethasone dose during radiotherapy in both groups was not statistically different. Boswellic acids could be detected in patients' serum.  CONCLUSIONS: BS significantly reduced cerebral edema measured by MRI in the study population. BS could potentially be steroid-sparing for patients receiving brain irradiation. From:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21287538  ",

If it\u2019s possible, have your wife's mets biopsied to see what their estrogen (ER), Progesterone (PR) and Her2 status are, since over time they may be different than her original cancer. If the new cancer is ER+ your oncologist should be considering hormonal treatment, and if it's Her2+ then Herceptin should be added. Please remember to keep copies of all tests results and scans in case you both eventually want to have a second opinion from a specialist outside your medical network. You may also want to seek a second opinion about her treatment. Also, I was wondering whether, if your wife's tumor(s) may be biopsy-able, you might consider sending a sample off for chemo sensitivity testing?  The tumor would be tested against different chemos and combos to see what it may be susceptible to, and what it may be resistant to.  This is still considered controversial and many doctors do not believe in it, and it may not be covered by insurance.  However, several people have indicated that it has helped them and that it was superior to the hit-or-miss approach to chemo that is used today.  If you are interested, two viable places are Rational Therapeutics  www.rationaltherapeutics.com/   and Weisenthal.  http://weisenthalcancer.com/Home.html    Dr. Nagourney of Rational Therapeutics studied under Dr. Weisenthal, and Dr. Weisenthal has been doing this since the 1990s.  I\u2019ve personally spoken to Dr. Weisenthal\u2019s  staff and was very impressed.

I have read that copper chelation works generally well against TNBC.  Here's something you might wish to discuss with your doctor. Good luck whatever you decide! Copper Depletion Therapy Tetrathiomolybdate Keeps High-Risk Triple-Negative Breast Cancer at Bay - New Weill Cornell Study Shows Anti-Copper Drug Might Prevent the Spread of Cancer to Organs NEW YORK (February 13, 2013) \u2014 An anti-copper drug compound that disables the ability of bone marrow cells from setting up a \"home\" in organs to receive and nurture migrating cancer tumor cells has shown surprising benefit in one of the most difficult-to-treat forms of cancer \u2014 high-risk triple-negative breast cancer. The median survival for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients is historically nine months. However, results of a new phase II clinical trial conducted by researchers at Weill Cornell Medical College and reported in the Annals of Oncology shows if patients at high-risk of relapse with no current visible breast cancer are copper depleted, it results in a prolonged period of time with no cancer recurrence. In fact, only two of 11 study participants with a history of advanced triple-negative breast cancer relapsed within 10 months after using the anti-copper drug, tetrathiomolybdate (TM). Dr. Vahdat says four of the study participants with a history of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer have had long-term benefit remaining disease free for between three and five and a half years. \"The anti-copper compound appears to be keeping tumors that want to spread in a dormant state,\" reports Dr. Vahdat, who is also medical oncologist at the Iris Cantor Women's Health Center at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. \"We believe one of the important ways it works is by affecting the tumor microenvironment, specifically the bone marrow-derived cells that are critical for metastasis progression.\" In addition, study participants with other forms of high-risk for relapse breast cancers \u2014 either stage 3 or stage 4 \u2014 without evidence of disease after treatment have also fared well. The progression-free survival rate among these 29 patients in the study has been 85 percent, to date. \"As good as these interim findings look to us, we cannot talk about significant benefit until we compare TM treatment to other therapies,\" she says. Dr. Vahdat expects to launch a phase III randomized clinical trial in the near future. This research is a report of the first 40 patients. The clinical trial, which began in 2007, has been expanded many times and now includes 60 patients, more than half of who have triple-negative breast cancer. Deplete Copper to Prevent Cancer Spread New discoveries in the science of metastasis and examination of the body's utilization of copper to promote cancer spread led to this clinical trial. Investigators at Weill Cornell, including some of this study's co-authors, have contributed to the recent understanding of the role bone marrow cells play in promoting metastasis. They previously found that a collection of bone marrow-derived cells, which include VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), prepare a site in distant organs to accept cancer cells. HPCs also recruit endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), among others, to activate an \"angiogenic switch\" that establish blood vessels at the site to feed newly migrated cancer cells. Breast cancer research studies conducted at Weill Cornell have also found that immediately prior to cancer relapse, levels of EPCs and HPCs rise significantly further, suggesting that the EPC target of the copper depletion approach is one that makes sense. \"Breast tumors want to move to specific organs, and these EPCs and HPCs cells leave a 'popcorn trail' for cancer cells to follow, as well as provide the building blocks for blood vessels to greet them as they arrive,\" Dr. Vahdat says. Copper is critical to mobilizing these cells. Copper is essential to the metastatic process. It is a key component of enzymes that help turn on angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment, and it also appears to play a role in directing cancer cell migration and invasion, according to researchers. TM is a copper chelation compound used to treat Wilson's disease, a hereditary copper metabolism disorder, and has been studied in phase I and phase II clinical trials for a number of disorders. Animal studies have demonstrated that depleting copper decreases proliferation of EPCs, as well as blood vessel formation and tumor growth. In the study, researchers found that 75 percent of patients achieved the copper depletion target using TM after one month of therapy, and that copper depletion was most efficient (91 percent) in patients with triple-negative tumors, compared to other tumor types (41 percent). In copper-depleted patients only, there was a significant reduction in EPCs, and the 10-month relapse-free survival was 85 percent. In addition, TM was found to be safe and well-tolerated in patients.",

Then came a hysterectomy which dried and withered the previously lush area.  Intercourse became extremely painful, and my husband (thank heavens) is extremely tender and loving and didn't want me to be in any pain.  In the absence of intercourse we became creative with fingers, vibrators and showers.  I must be the only person on this Forum who flunked Scream Cream 101.  I gave it a go in the hope of having intercourse again and couldn't bat 1, much less 100.

Any result that is 1% or higher should be considered hormone receptor positive. Furthermore, based upon additional information at the very bottom of this post, a small subset of people with even a 0% score may have the potential of responding to hormonal therapy. Please don't hesitate to engage your doctor in assisting you if you are TNBC (or ER and PR negative and HER2 positive) and want to explore this. You may also want to share this post (and the links) with your doctor. I found this information to be both intriguing and terrifying at the same time, as it's highly likely that many people - both with MBC and early stage breast cancer - whose cancer has been declared hormone receptor negative may indeed possibly benefit from hormonal therapy. How the hormone receptivity test results appear in a patient\u2019s pathology report may vary.  Not all labs use the same method for analyzing the results of the test, and they do not have to report the results in exactly the same way: > The results may appear as a percentage that indicates how many cells out of 100 stain positive for hormone receptors. The lab will provide a number between 0% (none have receptors) and 100% (all have receptors). > They may be reflected as a number between 0 and 3.  \u201c0\u201d means that no receptors are present, \u201c1\u201d a small number present,  \u201c2\u201d a medium number, and \u201c3\u201d a large number. > The lab may use an \u201cAllred\u201d score between 0 and 8. This technique looks at the percentage of cells that test positive for hormone receptors, as well as how well the receptors show up after staining (this is called \u201cintensity\u201d).  The percentage and intensity factors are combined to give a score between 0 and 8.  The higher the score, the more receptors were found and the easier they were to see in the sample. > The lab may simply state the hormone receptor status is \u201cPositive\u201d or \u201cNegative.\u201d If the lab result is reported as just the word \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative,\u201d patients should ask their doctor for a more definite percentage.  Different labs have different cutoff points for calling the cancer either hormone-receptor-positive or hormone-receptor-negative.  For example, if between 1% and 9% of the cells stain positive (a category called \u201cborderline\u201d into which 6% of all breast cancers fall), one lab might call this a positive result whereas another lab may declare it a negative result. Research studies have shown that any positive result, no matter how low (even the \u201cborderline\u201d 1% to 9% positive category), suggests that hormonal therapy might help treat the cancer. A score of \u201c0%\u201d is needed to completely rule out hormonal therapy as a treatment option (and even then, there may be exceptions as per the study at the very bottom). From:  http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/ihc One study published in the 2012 by American Society of Clinical Oncology examined 25 breast cancers with 1% to 10% Estrogen Receptor positivity by immunohistochemistry (IHC).  The purpose of the study was to determine whether these cancers showed the same global gene-expression pattern and high ESR1 mRNA expression as ER positive cancers, or if they were more similar to ER negative cancers.  Of the 1% to 9% IHC-positive breast cancers, six (24%) were also ER positive by ESR1 mRNA expression.  For the 6 patients whose breast cancer was exactly at 10% positivity, the majority showed ESR1 mRNA (or ER-associated gene signature scores) that were consistent with ER-positive status.  It should be highlighted that 16 patients whose tumors had been tested at 0% positive by IHC ALSO showed ESR1 mRNA expression - and ESR1-associated gene signature scores - THAT WERE CONSISTENT WITH ER-POSITIVE status, and could be considered false negatives by IHC testing.  From: http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/30/7/729.long Dx 10/6/2011, IDC, Left, Stage IV, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

In brief, Komen\u2019s revenue allocations and spending have fallen woefully short of actualizing a cure.  In 2012, Komen spent a mere 18% of its total expenses on research while showering its Founder and CEO with nearly $685,000 in salary and benefits.  And of the 18% of research funds, it is unclear as to what proportion was specifically designated for mbc. http://ww5.komen.org/uploadedFiles/Content/AboutUs/Financial/1207-1375237%20Financial%20Statements%20as%20of%2010.31.12_eissue.pdf  (see p. 3 for itemized expenses)  and:  http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2013/05/nancy-brinker-gets-big-pay-raise.html/ With less than a quarter of revenue spent on breast cancer research and a disproportionate executive compensation package, finding a cure has evidently not been Komen\u2019s top priority. In addition, despite requests to warn the public that mammograms can provide false negative results, Komen has refused to take any action.  This has resulted in an unwarranted volume of breast cancer deaths in over two decades because women with dense breasts and their physicians had total faith in negative (false) mammogram results. For The Cure?  No, Komen's motto should be For the Coffers.",

That said, many of us have outlived the statistics for our prognosis.  I believe very firmly in both conventional and supplemental therapies to optimize our chances.  For that reason I consult with a Naturopathic Oncologist as well as a Medical Oncologist and keep each apprised of the therapies that the other recommends.  I believe your mother's current conventional treatment regimen of a platinum drug and radiation is very sound, and have provided my notes below about metastatic TNBC for your consideration.  I would also suggest consulting a breast surgeon about removing the tumor that is protruding, thus relieving some of her tumor burden as well as the psychological aspect of actually seeing it.  Surgery may not be viable while she is immunosuppressed, however.  And I always encourage patients to obtain a second opinion about treatment whenever a crossroads is reached (i.e. a therapy fails and a new one must be selected). Please accept my best wishes for your mother, and a warm virtual hug to you both!  Triple negative breast cancer (\u201cTNBC\u201d) does not contain hormone receptors for estrogen or progesterone, nor does it have receptors to Her2.  Usually TNBC is treated with chemotherapy drugs. Other targeted agents are being developed including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), FGFR2, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and NOTCH inhibitors. Relative to chemotherapy, in a phase 3 multicenter study, women with metastatic TNBC had a more significant response to treatment with eribulin (Halaven) versus capecitabine (Xeloda). From:http://curetoday.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/blog.showIndex/guest/2012/12/9/A-recap-of-triplenegative-breast-cancer-research-from-San-Antonio  Many people with TNBC can respond well to platinum chemotherapy drugs.  Myriad Genetics has recently derived an \u201cHRD\u201d test to predict which people will respond better to platinum-based drugs.  From: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/270261.php Additionally, Copper Depletion Therapy may be helpful against TNBC: \"81 percent of the women with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who took the copper-reducing drug tetrathiomolybdate, or TM, daily in a small study at Weill Cornell Medical College, were relapse-free after 10 months.\" From http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2013/03/copper_depletion_shows_early_s.html    Note: Please don't pay attention to the survival stats - they are quite outdated!  As a final thought, perhaps you might consider sending a sample off for chemo sensitivity testing?  The tumor would be tested against different chemos and combos to see what it may be susceptible to, and what it may be resistant to.  This is still considered controversial and many doctors do not believe in it, and it may not be covered by insurance.  However, several people have indicated that it has helped them and that it was superior to the hit-or-miss approach to chemo that is used today.  If you are interested, two viable places are Rational Therapeutics www.rationaltherapeutics.com/  and Weisenthal. http://weisenthalcancer.com/Home.html  Dr. Nagourney of Rational Therapeutics studied under Dr. Weisenthal, and Dr. Weisenthal has been doing this since the 1990s.

You mentioned having a multi-level house: might you think about installing a stairway elevator?  That way you will not need to navigate the stairs. I know this may sound a bit lame, but have you considered taking up a new hobby?  There may be local classes in something you might be interested in. Also, if you could rent or download movies, they may help take your mind off things, even for a little while. Finally, in addition to anti-depressants, perhaps you might consider a therapist?  This may be a mixed bag, as some people welcome the idea and others feel quite differently.  It's just a thought for your consideration!

According to the latest (2014) NCCN Guidelines, \u201cPatients may be candidates for hormonal therapy irrespective of their hormone receptivity status, provided that their cancer is in the bones, soft tissue (muscle, fat or nerves), or internal organs and is not causing symptoms.  The reason for suggesting hormonal therapy is because sometimes the metastasis is indeed hormone receptor positive and the actual test results are incorrect.  Therefore, hormone receptor negative patients and their doctors should consider hormonal therapy especially if the patient had a long disease free period after initial treatment, if their cancer is confined to one or few sites, and their cancer is not causing symptoms.\u201d (This represents a major shift in thinking regarding potential therapies for TNBC and hormone receptor negative patients).

This study also aims to describe AIO treatments recommended by naturopathic oncologists for these advanced stage cancer patients and pilot the collection and evaluation of health-related quality of life data on a subset of Canadian AIO-treated patients... Although there have been some studies of complementary and alternative medicine use by cancer patients, little is known about the effectiveness of the naturopathic medicine and TCM provided to people with cancer in an integrative setting. While there is scientific evidence supporting specific treatments that are commonly used, systematic study of their effectiveness (especially when used in combination as commonly recommended) is virtually non-existent. An early step in the evaluation of clinical outcomes associated with AIO is to take a health service approach and seek to answer the question: \"Does exposure to AIO services improve the clinical outcomes of patients with advanced stage cancer?\" The survival outcome of consecutively recruited advanced stage breast, colorectal, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer patients treated at multiple naturopathic oncology clinics in North America will be tracked and compared to outcomes published in the current medical literature and by SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) in order to address the fundamentally important question of whether or not AIO has a beneficial impact on survival. Involvement of a total of seven active AIO clinics from Canada and the US will allow the recruitment of a sufficient sample size to address this question as well as provide outcomes that are generalizable for AIO across North America.\" From: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02494037",

As for the ulcerative colitis (UC), perhaps you might consider looking into probiotics if you haven't already done so. Just saw this in Healthline: https://www.healthline.com/health/ulcerative-colitis-take-control-probiotics#5 In the case of UC, an imbalance of bacteria in the large intestine is thought to be the perceived danger that prompts the immune system to respond. Probiotics may help resolve this problem by providing good bacteria that help restore the bacterial balance in the intestine, eliminating the problem that the immune system is responding to. With the perceived danger gone, the immune system may soften or stop its attack. Pros Probiotics may help increase the time between flare-ups and may make the symptoms of a flare-up less severe. Also, probiotics are likely less expensive than typical UC medications, and they may be safer over long periods. Probiotics may also protect against other bowel problems such as Clostridium difficile colitis and travelers' diarrhea. That's a lot of benefits, but there are a few cons of using probiotics with UC. The main one is that they're probably not useful in causing a faster remission during a flare-up of UC. Another con is that certain people should use them cautiously. Probiotics contain living bacteria, so they may increase infection risk in people with compromised immune systems (such as those taking long-term or high-dose corticosteroids). This is because a weakened immune system might not be able to keep the live bacteria in check, and an infection may result. ",

Pain and neuropathy are frequent and highly distressing symptoms experienced by cancer patients.In some instances they may be caused by the cancer itself, and/or in other cases they may be caused by treatment.Neuropathy (sometimes referred to as peripheral neuropathy) is a result of damage to the peripheral nerves.Neuropathy may cause weakness, numbness and pain, usually in the hands and feet.If a patient experiences significant pain and/or neuropathy, they should contact their doctor.And if subsequent intervention fails to help to relieve these symptoms and the patient remains in considerable discomfort, the patient might consider arranging for palliative care as per the \"Palliative Care and Hospice\" section. Unfortunately, cancer pain is often undertreated, causing unnecessary misery for the patient. Under-treatment is due to many factors, including: In many instances, the less potent pain medications (which are purchased Over The Counter, or \"OTC\") may actually have more side effects.For instance, common OTC pain relievers might damage the kidneys, cause ulcers, or raise the patient's blood pressure. Aspirin can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, and acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) can cause liver damage if too much of the drug is taken. ",

A diagnosis of breast cancer \u2013 especially metastatic breast cancer \u2013 can be highly discouraging and challenging to deal with.  But it must be remembered that more therapies are becoming available regularly, as are new clinical trials.  Maintaining optimal health under the circumstances is important not just for well-being, but for surviving long enough to take advantage of potential new and effective treatments.  And the good news is that the longer a person lives with metastatic breast cancer, the longer he or she is likely to live! This concept, called \u201cConditional Survival,\u201d is based upon a 2010 statistical analysis of huge numbers of patients in the SEER database.  The following percentages are probabilities of five years of relative survival (taking into account breast cancer-specific survival and setting aside other causes of death) for different time periods following a diagnosis with metastatic breast cancer. At 0 years (i.e. when first diagnosed with MBC), the probability of five MORE years of relative survival is 25.3%  At 1 year already survived MBC, the probability of five MORE years of relative survival is 32.4%  At 2 years already survived MBC, the probability of five MORE years of relative survival is 39.1%  At 3 years already survived MBC, the probability of five MORE years of relative survival is 45.5%  At 4 years already survived MBC, the probability of five MORE years of relative survival is 52.0%  At 5 years already survived MBC, the probability of five MORE years of relative survival is 56.9%  From: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3228022/table/T2/  (Look under \u201cDistant\u201d and \u201cBreast Cancer\u201d). A more recent study of conditional survival in breast cancer data from SEER examined cases that were diagnosed during 2000-2008 and followed up through 2013.  Specific to distant breast cancer disease, the analysis indicated that five-year relative survival was 30%, and that the improvement in 5-year relative survival from diagnosis to five years already survived for distant disease was 91.4%.  From: https://www.omicsonline.org/conference-proceedings/2161-1165-C1-016-001.pdf ",

Again, this is purely observational and anecdotal. When I was diagnosed with mets I went on a vegan diet with the exception of the Budwig protocol Flaxseed Oil and Cottage Cheese, and ended up dreaming about eggs! I've now come to believe that our constitutions are as individual as our cancers are, and that what may be helpful for one individual may have absolutely no effect upon another. So now, I believe that \"eating healthy\" (minimal to zero processed foods, lots of organic fruits and vegetable [especially cruciferous]), organically fed animal products such as chicken, eggs, beef (yes, occasional grass fed beef may be good for the blood!) some whole grains, and limited carbohydrates help keep one's constitution as healthy as possible. And such diets, which contain little processed sugar or white flour, help to keep inflammation low. Do I sin? Absolutely. Just last night I enjoyed a Middle Eastern Eggplant pita sandwich washed down with red wine, which would have been unheard of for me to consume three years ago! For those who may be interested, an excellent book on the subject is Dr. David Servain-Schreiber's \"Anti Cancer: A New Way of Life.\" It was written by an doctor who was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor, and who lived for 20 years following conventional therapy and the principles in his book.

In an excellent 2019 video about the use of radiotherapy for brain metastasis, Dr. Paul Brown, Professor of Radiation Oncology at the Mayo Clinic, suggested the following guidelines for radiation treatment irrespective of where the cancer originated (breast, lung, colon, etc.).Those wishing to view the video may visit: https://vimeo.com/321234317/33959e4ee9 For patients with oligometastases (defined in the video as one to four brain metastases), Stereotactic RadioSurgery (SRS) is recommended.Adding Whole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT) thereafter helps to prevent additional brain metastases, but does not improve Overall Survival (OS) and can significantly degrade cognitive abilities and Quality Of Life (QOL).Therefore, SRS is considered the standard of care for these patients. For patients with a single large brain metastasis, surgery plus SRS is considered the standard of care.(Adding WBRT can help prevent additional brain metastases, but it fails to improve OS and can significantly diminish cognitive capabilities and QOL). For patients with multiple (widespread) brain metastases, or patients who have a rapid recurrence (i.e. within a few months) of brain metastases treated with SRS, Hippocampal Avoidance (HA) WBRT with Memantine HCL is recommended, although using SRS alone for patients with up to 10 brain metastases may also be a viable option. (The role of systemic therapy in this context is still being explored). HA (or Hippocampus-sparing) WBRT is a special form of WBRT that spares the hippocampus (a small region of the brain that is primarily associated with memory and spatial navigation) from being targeted by radiation.HA WBRT is accomplished by using Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), which is an advanced mode of high-precision radiotherapy that uses computer-controlled linear accelerators to deliver precise radiation doses to a malignant tumor or specific areas within the tumor.Memantine HCL is an Alzheimer's drug that can help prevent cognitive decline.

Then in 2007 I developed the dry chronic cough, and nothing showed up on an Xray.  In 2011 I became hoarse and my left eyelid began drooping, which turned out to be Horner's syndrome which was caused by a lung met pressing on a nerve.  The hoarseness was caused by a paralyzed vocal cord which was due to a lung met pressing on a laryngeal nerve.  Yuck! Once the CT scan revealed the lung mets and a biopsy confirmed metastatic bc, I had a liter of malignant pleural effusion drained and started hormonal therapy.    Today the hoarseness is gone and I no longer have the cough! I think my situation was kind of unusual - TMs were normal, long interval between original diagnosis and recurrence, and the Horner's and hoarseness.  I am hoping that your situation turns out to be very different and that the root cause is entirely benign! Also, please ask your doctor to check out your heart thoroughly, as sometimes cardiac issues can cause a cough.

Researchers demonstrated that they could predict fairly accurately which patients would have this positive response. They conducted PET scans before estrogen treatment and 24 hours later. If metastatic tumors flared, or glowed more brightly, in the PET scans after estrogen was started, they were much more likely to be affected by estrogen therapy.

Below from my MBC Guide is a list of draining procedures that people with pleural effusion may undergo.   You (and others) are welcome to request a complimentary copy of the 100+ page MBC Therapies booklet by visiting:  https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/831507?page=1#post_4391326 For patients who have pleural effusion, there are three methods of draining the fluid to provide relief: Indwelling (Pleurx or Aspira) Catheter: This is the surgical insertion, under general anesthesia, of a small tube placed temporarily into the pleural space that allows the patient or his/her family member to drain the fluid into a bottle as needed.  Patients with an indwelling catheter are fully mobile and are not \u201cattached\u201d to the draining bottle except when draining the fluid.  Once there is no more drainage at all, the catheter is removed either in the doctor\u2019s office or an outpatient procedure.  Overall, indwelling catheters seem to help prevent the fluid from building up again, provided      that the patient\u2019s systemic treatment is working.  The Pleurx catheter works via suction, and the newer gentler model is the Aspira catheter, which is a bit less uncomfortable because uses gravity instead of suction for draining.    Pleurodesis (sometimes referred to as a \u201ctalc procedure\u201d) is a process in which substances, such as talc, are used to try to get the edge of the lung to stick to the chest wall in order to decrease the chance of the fluid returning.  Although this procedure seems to help      prevent the fluid from building up again (provided that systemic treatment is working) it can be painful and usually requires a brief hospital stay.  Some patients have reported discomfort months after the procedure, although others have no residual effects. Thoracentesis  (sometimes  referred to as \u201ctapping\u201d) is an outpatient procedure that involves      placing one needle per required side into the pleural space. Although local anesthesia is  administered, this procedure can be uncomfortable and may cause scarring if repeated over time.  The procedure also does not hinder fluid buildup again. Warning:  If a patient is experiencing shortness of breath but the doctor cannot find anything in the lungs that is causing it, the patient should be checked carefully for blood clots as well as for cardiac issues.  Either of these issues may cause symptoms that appear to be lung related problems, when in fact they are not.",

The phase I trial reported by Dr. Patnaik explored the effect of LY2835219 in five different tumor types . At the AACR meeting, Dr. Patnaik reported results in a cohort of 47 patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a median of seven prior therapies. Median age was 55 years. The majority had two or more metastatic sites; 74% had visceral metastases. Thirty-six patients (76%) were hormone receptor\u2013positive. Among all patients, 11 (19%) had a partial response and 24 (29.8%) had stable disease. Progressive disease occurred in 11 patients (23.8%) who received LY2835219. Progression-free survival was estimated at 9.1 months. Among hormone receptor\u2013positive patients, 9 (25%) had confirmed partial responses and 20 (56%) had stable disease, including 2 with unconfirmed partial responses; the clinical benefit rate was 61%, and disease control rate was 81%.

      "Content": "Bestbird wrote: The annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference encompasses multiple types of cancer, and this year many abstracts were submitted about metastatic breast cancer (MBC).  I\u2019ve reviewed the abstracts and taken the liberty of pasting information about those that were not previously in my book, \u201cThe Insider\u2019s Guide to Metastatic Breast Cancer.\u201d  To order the book from Amazon or download the complimentary .pdf, you are welcome to visit: https://www.insidersguidembc.com For hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative patients, a key question has been whether Verzenio (Abemaciclib) can be effective after prior failure on Ibrance or Kisqali.  Based upon the two small studies provided below, the answer appears to be Yes although more robust studies are called for. Hopefully there\u2019ll be more to come in June after the conference, and I hope you find this helpful! 1. For Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative MBC Taking Verzenio after Prior Failure on Ibrance or Kisqali:  Ibrance, Kisqali and Verzenio are CDK4/6 inhibitors, although Verzenio works somewhat differently.  A small study of 19 evaluable heavily pre-treated HR+ HER2- MBC patients conducted by the Moffitt Cancer Center concluded that Verzenio elicited a response in a significant number of patients who previously took Ibrance in combination with endocrine therapy.  The study participants had previously received a mean of 5.6 prior therapies, and 73.6% had visceral involvement (including brain metastasis in 26%).  15 of the study patients were given Verzenio in combination with endocrine therapy and 4 patients received Verzenio as a single agent.  The median Progression Free Survival (PFS) on Verzenio was 7.0 months, and although no partial or complete responses were observed, 33% of the patients had stable disease. From: https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/177494/abstract From Feb. 2015 to Jan. 2019, a somewhat larger study evaluated clinical outcomes in patients with HR+/HER2- MBC who received Verzenio after progressing on Ibrance or Kisqali.  20 (34%) of the patients on Verzenio had disease progression in less than 3 months, while 21 patients (36%) had a treatment duration exceeding 6 months - including 10 patients who remained on treatment at interim analysis (range 181-413 days).  The median PFS on Verzenio following a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor was 5.8 months.  Interestingly, a preliminary analysis of circulating free DNA revealed RB1 and FGFR1 alterations in patients who exhibited progressive disease.  From: https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/175766/abstract Phase 1 study of Lenvatinib and Letrozole: Lenvatinib, an approved drug that is used to treat liver, thyroid, and kidney cancer, is currently being studied against other types of cancer.  It works by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is a signal protein produced by cells that stimulates the formation of blood vessels that in turn promote tumor growth.  In a very small study that included 12 MBC patients (8 of whom had prior therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy), lenvatinib combined with letrozole elicited an overall disease control rate (DCR) of 92% after 12 weeks.  (Anne\u2019s note: Although not explicitly stated in the abstract, it is assumed that all 12 patients had hormone receptor positive disease, although it is unclear whether they were also HER2 negative).  From: https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/175824/abstract Potential Impact of Being on a CDK4/6 Inhibitor before Moving on to Afinitor:  A small study examined the medical records of 33 patients who underwent therapy with Afinitor and Aromasin (A/A).  17 of the patients had prior CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy combined with endocrine therapy and 16 had taken either letrozole or arimidex alone.  In patients who had previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor, the PFS was 5.7 months vs. 4.7 months in patients who had taken letrozole or arimidex alone.  The median overall survival of patients who\u2019d had a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor was 17.8 months vs. 11.4 months for those who had only taken letrozole or arimidex.  The study concluded that A/A was effective for patients who had previously received CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy and for those who had received prior therapy with an aromatase inhibitor alone.  From: https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/177375/abstract 2. For HER2 Positive MBC Prognostic Factors Relative to HER2 Positive Patients: A Canadian study evaluated the clinical characteristics of 119 evaluable patients with HER2+ MBC and an unusually prolonged response to anti-HER2 therapy.  The patients had been treated with either: 1) Herceptin, Perjeta, and a taxane 2) Herceptin plus chemotherapy, or 3) TDM-1.  Patients with median duration of response that was 2 times higher than the Phase 2 or 3 trials for each regimen were included in the study due to their prolonged response.  41% of these patients were NED (No Evidence of Disease) and 59% had residual disease.  It was determined that patients who were NED were generally under the age of 50 and had never had breast surgery.  Patients who were NED enjoyed relative longevity when compared with patients who had residual disease.  Treatment type and number of organs with metastases were deemed to be merely of borderline significance. From: https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/176119/abstract Conversely, the Cleveland Clinic evaluated 47 HER2+ patients, many of whom also had hormone receptor positive disease.  17 patients (36%) had a mastectomy after diagnosis of stage IV breast cancer.  The two-year OS (Overall Survival) for the 17 patients who had a mastectomy was 94%, and the two-year OS for the 30 patients with no mastectomy was 50%. The study concluded that on univariable analysis (as a single statistical variable), only mastectomy vs no mastectomy predicted OS, and that on multivariable analysis, mastectomy vs no mastectomy remained a statistically significant predictor of OS.  The study furthermore determined that age, chemotherapy, HER2-directed therapy, and breast radiation were not independent predictors of improved OS.  From: https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/177083/abstract 3. General: Low Dose Metronomic Chemotherapy: In a retrospective case-control-analysis, the effectiveness of low dose metronomic chemotherapy (LDMC) was compared with conventionally-administered chemotherapy in 105 MBC patients taking cytoxan and methotrexate.  Of the 35 patients taking LDMC, 31% had a disease control rate (DCR) at 6 months vs. 26% of the 70 patients taking conventional chemotherapy.  In the TNBC MBC group, 30% of the LDMC patients showed a DCR vs. 5% of the patients in the control group.  From: https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/171918/abstract Dx 10/6/2011, IDC, Left, Stage IV, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Before starting on Afinitor, please discuss a potential test (below) to help determine whether Afinitor may work well for you. Oncogenic mutations of PI3K catalytic α subunit (PIK3CA) are among the most frequently reported genetic aberrations in human cancers. These mutations activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and contribute to carcinogenesis, providing the rationale for inhibiting this pathway for cancer therapy. The development of agents to target components of this pathway has resulted in a class of drugs that specifically target mTOR. Such as Afinitor.  Before starting Afinitor, speak with your doctor about getting tested for the appropriate genetic mutation(s) that will help predict whether you might respond to this drug.",

As for risk factors, 80% of people who get bc have no known risk factors, so it's probably not worthwhile considering childlessness as a cause of our bc.  It could've happened either way, so looking back is a waste of precious time that could be better spent on something you enjoy!",

About your question re: Vitamin C infusions.  My Naturopathic Oncologist recommended them (among other things) but after exhaustive research I couldn't find anything substantive about high dose Vit.

Having said that, I personally think diet can help keep the body strong and potentially help fight cancer.  I was a vegan for a while but simply ended up missing protein too much.  That said, I still follow a fairly pure diet and have no sugar or sweeteners other than stevia.  Again, it's something you'll need to decide for yourself.

The testimonials from people with cancer of all stages who have followed the protocol with success are voluminous and - to my mind - moving.  Although many complementary therapies are accompanied by wonderful testimonials, when I hopped on Amazon.com to read reviews of the book I was astounded.  I subsequently researched the Budwig Protocol and every supplement in the book before beginning Bill's Protocol.   I've only been on the protocol for 2 weeks so it's too soon to say if it is working, but two interesting things have occurred since I started.  The first is that my paralyzed vocal cord (due to a lung lesion) has begun to vibrate, and the second is that I have literally tons more energy.  I am also on Femara so that may play a part in healing as well - it's impossible to distinguishbetween the two (except for the energy, which I attribute completely to the diet). I apologize for the lengthy post.  Whatever you decide, you'll want to research it fully and ensure that it feels \"right\" for you! ",

Also., perhaps you might also consider sending a sample of the tumor off for chemo sensitivity testing?  It would be tested against different chemos and combos to see what it may be susceptible to, and what it may be resistant to.  This is still considered controversial and many doctors do not believe in it, and it may not be covered by insurance.  However, several people have indicated that it has helped them and that it was superior to the hit-or-miss approach to chemo that is used today.  If you are interested, two viable places are Rational Therapeutics http://www.rationaltherapeutics.com/  and Weisenthal. http://weisenthalcancer.com/Home.html  Dr. Weisenthal has been doing this since the 1990s, so he has extensive experience. Good luck on whatever you decide! TNBC Therapies: Relative to chemotherapy, in a phase 3 multicenter study, women with metastatic TNBC had a more significant response to treatment with eribulin (Halaven) versus capecitabine (Xeloda).  From:http://curetoday.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/blog.showIndex/guest/2012/12/9/A-recap-of-triplenegative-breast-cancer-research-from-San-Antonio There has been some success with a trio of Avastin (bevacizumab), Halaven (eribulin mesylate), and Xeloda (capecitabine). Many people with TNBC can respond well to platinum chemotherapy drugs.  Myriad Genetics has recently derived an \u201cHRD\u201d test to predict which people will respond better to platinum-based drugs.  From: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/270261.php Additionally, the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), a type of white blood cell, ahead of treatment may help predict response to platinum-based chemotherapy in women with triple-negative breast cancer. From http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/276870.php Melatonin:\"An early stage study shows melatonin - a hormone that regulates the body's sleep and awake cycles - may have the potential to help slow the growth of certain breast cancer tumors, according to researchers from Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and Foundation for Research Support of the State of São Paulo. The study, published online in the journal PLoS One, finds that melatonin may inhibit tumor growth and cell production, as well as block the formation of new blood vessels in ER-negative breast cancer models. \"These early stage research results with the melatonin drug in a triple-negative breast cancer animal models achieved in our lab has not been seen anywhere else,\" says study co-author Adarsh Shankar, a research assistant in the Department of Radiology at Henry Ford Hospital. ... The study's authors caution, however, that this research is still in its very early stages and results are not yet ready to be translated for patient use.\" Additionally, Copper Depletion Therapy may be helpful against TNBC! \"81 percent of the women with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who took the copper-reducing drug tetrathiomolybdate, or TM, daily in a small study at Weill Cornell Medical College, were relapse-free after 10 months.\"  From www.cleveland.com/healthfit/in... ",

Corrie recently wrote the following on Facebook: \"I wanted to let you know that Dr. Wagle was at the White House last week talking with Joe Biden's staff as a lead up to the Moon Shot program that President Obama talked about last night in his State of the Union.

Thereafter, you and your doctor might consider Estradiol (indeed a therapy for ER+ mbc as odd as it sounds! Our Longtermsurvivor was on it for quite some time). There is also Megace, or Halotestin. All of these are FDA-approved. I'm also wondering whether you have been checked for MS, as sometimes MS can cause neuropathy and issues similar to those you describe.

It is very loving of you to reach out on your girlfriend's behalf, and you are indeed a wonderful advocate for her. If the type of cancer your girlfriend has is Lobular, it's not unusual for it to migrate to the abdominal area, where it sometimes precipitates ascites (fluid buildup). Since the fluid was tested for cancer, your girlfriend should request a copy of the pathology report, and specifically look for Estrogen Receptivity (ER), Progesterone Receptivity (PR) and HER2 receptivity. It is possible that the cancer cells may have changed their pathology, so this is crucial info because it may influence her future treatment. (In addition, your girlfriend should retain personal copies of all medical records and test results for ease of reference, and in case she seeks a second opinion). Ascites can also prevent the patient from ingesting enough food, and as such it should be taken very seriously. Draining the area (as she has in the past) should be discussed with her doctor. It is possible that your girlfriend's current treatment may help over time. Please discuss your girlfriend's supplemental therapies (such as Avemar) and her current therapy with her oncologist and naturopath to ensure they are compatible. I hope your girlfriend begins to feel better soon! Below from my MBC Guide is information about ascites.You (and others) are welcome to request a complimentary copy of the 119 page booklet by visiting the top of this page:https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/831507?page=2#idx_39 Patients with metastatic lobular breast cancer are more likely than are other types of metastatic breast cancer patients to have their cancer spread to the abdominal (gastric) area, the ovary, and/or the peritoneum (which is the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity and covers most of the abdominal organ). Breast cancer metastasis to the stomach represents evidence of systemic disease and therefore systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy (rather than surgical resection) is indicated.In most cases, surgical resection is not possible due to local invasion.Some experts feel that surgical treatment should be reserved only for patients who develop complications such as obstruction or bleeding.However, one study showed that patients with metastasis only to the gastrointestinal tract who underwent palliative surgical resection tended to have a more prolonged median survival (44 vs. 9 months).The decision-making process for surgical intervention should be based on the clinical presentation and symptoms, the availability of chemotherapeutic options, and a quality of life discussion.From: http://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/29/11/4759.full It is possible that the doctor will recommend systemic therapy based upon the patient's hormonal and HER2 profile after cancer metastasizes to the above site(s). Ascites (excess fluid):\"Ascites\" is a gastroenterological term that refers to an accumulation of fluid in the abdominal (peritoneal) cavity. The ascites can arise from tumors' expression of epithelial cell-adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Additionally, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been cited as an important factor affecting vascular permeability, a key factor in ascites production.From: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC288034... Ascites are generally evidenced by a distended stomach, shortness of breath, bloating, and/or other discomfort.Patients who believe they may have ascites should notify their doctors immediately. In patients with cancer-related ascites, diet restrictions and/or diuretics will generally not be effective, although there have been some exceptions. Paracentesis (a procedure whereby fluid is taken out using a long, thin needle put through the belly) may be the first-line ascites treatment. If needed, a catheter (either indwelling or a peritoneovenous shunt) may be left in place to drain so that fluid can be removed in such a manner that the patient does not need to undergo repeated procedures. Some patients have reported that draining the ascites daily instead of every few days provides them with superior relief. From: http://www.emedicinehealth.com/ascites/page7_em.ht... Catheters for Draining: Treatment options for draining abdominal ascites often entails the use of an indwelling catheter, paracentesis, or peritoneovenous shunting. Drugs that may help alleviate ascites and/or related discomfort: A separate study of 26 cancer patients who received at least three of four IP instillations of catumaxomab led to a median interval of 15 days before a patient required an intraperitoneal puncture.Median overall survival was 92.5 days, but five patients remained alive and free of puncture for as long as 876 days. It was concluded that IP catumaxomab can be administered in relatively frail outpatients, achieving good ascites control. A survival benefit was seen in fit patients who received complete IP catumaxomab treatment and were able to undergo subsequent systemic therapy.From: http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/SGO/44...

Pleural effusion: Pleural effusion, which may accompany lung metastasis, is a buildup of fluid between the layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity.  Often the fluid contains cancer cells.  Pleural effusion can cause coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain and other symptoms.  There are several ways in which the fluid may be drained: Thoracentesis (sometimes referred to as \u201ctapping\u201d)is an outpatient procedure thatinvolves placing one needle per required side into the pleural space. Although local anesthesia is administered, this procedure can be uncomfortable and can cause scarring if repeated over time, and the procedure may not impede fluid buildup again. Pleurx or Aspira Catheter: This is the surgical insertion, under general anesthesia, of a small tube placed temporarily into the pleural space that allows you or your family member to drain the fluid into a bottle as needed.  Once there is no more drainage, the catheter is removed.  This procedure seems to help prevent the fluid from building up again, provided that systemic treatment such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy is working.  The Pleurx catheter works via suction, and the newer gentler model is the Aspira catheter, which uses gravity for draining. Pleurodesis (sometimes referred to as a \u201ctalc procedure\u201d) is a process in which substances, such as talc, are used to try to get the edge of the lung to stick to the chest wall to decrease the chance of the fluid returning.  Although this procedure seems to help prevent the fluid from building up again (provided that systemic treatment such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy is working) it can be painful and usually requires a brief hospital stay.

This is a wonderful place for receiving support, sharing information, and for asking questions.  Right now you're probably in a state of shock.  But please know that as you and your doctor discuss treatment options and you begin your therapy, things will get better.  Before starting treatment, you might want to consider obtaining a second opinion, possibly locally or at a major cancer center such as MD Anderson. There are quite a few chemos for TNBC, and many of the participants here are TNBC-ers.  Irrespective of the tumor's characteristics, it would be helpful to keep a copy of all your test results and medical records in the event that you seek another opinion outside of your insurance network, or in case you need to travel for another opinion. In the event that you have a biopsy in the future, another thing to bear in mind is the possibility of sending the tumor for chemo sensitivity testing.  This is still controversial and many doctors do not believe in it, but there have been some studies reflecting better results when the chemo that's administered is one that the test shows the tumor to be susceptible to. Two places I've heard good things about are Rational Therapeutics and the Weisenthal Center. No matter what you decide to do or not do, please remember that you are not alone. With gentle hugs, - Anne",

From your profile it appears that your mets have been biopsied and that the cancer is ER, PR, and HER2 negative (TNBC). In reading about the clinical trial you mention, it appears that the results thus far have been encouraging: \" Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) presented results from a phase Ib study of the investigational cancer immunotherapy atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) used in combination with nab-paclitaxel in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The study showed that the combination shrank tumours (overall response rate, including unconfirmed responses) in 70.8% of people, [n=24; 95% confidence interval, (CI): 48.9, 87.4]. 11 of 17 responses (65%) continued on treatment at time of data cut-off. The highest overall response rate observed [88.9% (CI: 51.7, 99.7)] was in people receiving their initial (1st line) treatment for metastatic disease, with 1 confirmed complete responder. Responses were observed in both PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative patients. In addition, some patients with evidence of RECIST based progressive disease developed further response with continued treatment. Adverse events (AEs) were consistent with what has previously been reported for treatment of nab-paclitaxel alone, with 56% of patients (n=32) experiencing Grade 3\u20134 AEs. These data were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium 2015 congress.\" From: http://www.roche.com/investors/updates/inv-update-2015-12-11.htm That said, it is always worth seeking a second opinion, even if the second physician confirms your initial doctor's recommendation.

Two things came to mind: Vitamin D3 (you should be in the high-normal range, as Vit. D3 is linked with improved survival) and testosterone.  The latter is described below, courtesy of Musa Mayer, an expert on mbc. 53 ER/PR+ MBC patients were studied, all menopausal, median age 68, ranging from 45 to 90. Their breast cancers were considered ER/PR+ if there was more than 5% staining. All patients had responded to at least one hormonal treatment, had received at least two lines of hormonal treatment (eg. tamoxifen, Femara, Arimidex, Aromasin, Faslodex and/or Megace) and all had received an aromatase inhibitor. Many patients had also been treated with several kinds of chemotherapy. The median lines of all kinds of treatment patients had was 6, so these patients were, as they say \"extensively pretreated.\" The dominant sites of disease were visceral (lungs, liver, or other organs), bone, and soft tissue in 44%, 28%, and 28% respectively. This was the treatment tested: \"Testosterone propionate, 250 mg intramuscularly, was given once every two weeks, twice, and then once every four weeks until progression of disease, limiting toxicity, or death. The median duration of treatment was seven months, without dose reductions or delays.\" Nine patients (17%) had disease regression (also expressed as response rate), with one having complete regression (CR or complete response). Stable disease for at least 6 months was seen in 22 patients (41.5%). So the clinical benefit rate (obtained by adding response (or regression) plus stable disease for 6 months or more) was 58.5%. ",

This is very important: Please remember to keep copies of all tests results and scans in case you eventually want to have a second opinion from a specialist outside your medical network. You may also want to seek a second opinion at any point about your treatment. I was diagnosed with extensive lung mets along with malignant pleural effusion and pericardial effusion in 2011.  My oncologist wanted me to go on chemo.  I sought a second opinion who put me on letrozole (generic Femara, and Aromatase Inhibitor) and I've never looked back.  I know one person with lung mets who's still posting on another mbc forum 20 years later!

Dealing with the shock and fear can be very difficult. But as others have said, over time it gets a bit easier, and you'll find many people who are doing well with a good quality of life! I'd suggest having the pleural effusion tested to see what the estrogen (ER), Progesterone (PR) and HER2 status are, since they may differ from the original cancer. If the cancer is ER+ and/or PR+, then the oncologist should be considering hormonal treatment, and if it's HER2+ then Herceptin and Perjeta may be considered along with a Taxane. Additionally, you may want to request testing to see whether the tumor has Androgen Receptors (AR), since there are some promising clinical trials that target Androgen Receptors in a similar manner as current hormonal therapy targets Estrogen Receptors (ER).  Even if you are hormone receptor negative (ER- and PR-) you may still consider hormonal therapy according to the latest (2014) National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, \u201cPatients may be candidates for hormonal therapy irrespective of their hormone receptivity status, provided that their cancer is in the bones, soft tissue (muscle, fat or nerves), or internal organs and is not causing symptoms.  The reason for suggesting hormonal therapy is because sometimes the metastasis is indeed hormone receptor positive and the actual test results are incorrect.  (This represents a major shift in thinking regarding potential therapies for TNBC and hormone receptor negative patients).

The nt liquid would be tested against different chemotherapy drugs - and combinations thereof - to see what it may be susceptible to, and what it may be resistant to.This is still considered controversial and many doctors are not convinced of its value.Furthermore, it might not be covered by insurance. However, several people have indicated that it has helped them and that it was superior to the hit-or-miss approach to chemo that is used today.If you are interested, two viable places are Rational Therapeutics http://www.rationaltherapeutics.com/and Weisenthal.http://weisenthalcancer.com/Home.html Dr. Weisenthal has been doing this since the 1990 and was actually the mentor for Dr. Nagouyrney, who runs RT. So Dr. Weisenthal has extensive experience. Here's a link to a meta-analysis study that concluded there's a two-fold overall tumor response for a chemo assay-guided therapy versus standard of care therapy, and that patients who received assay-guided therapy compared to those who received standard of care or physician's choice had a significantly higher 1-year survival rate http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/118466-132 If you haven't already done so, I'd suggest requesting a complimentary copy of the 100+ page MBC Therapies booklet (from which the above verbiage was extracted) by visiting: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/831507?page=1#post_4391326 Good luck on whatever you decide!

Palliative care as suggested above sounds like the best thing to do to keep her comfortable. My summary about it is provided below. I hope that she becomes considerably more comfortable. With best wishes. Palliative care is meant to help anyone with a serious illness. A patient can request it at any age and any stage of an illness (even upon diagnosis), and it can be used along with curative treatment.Palliative care is not dependent on prognosis.With palliative care, patients can expect to have more control over their care, along with a comfortable and supportive atmosphere that reduces anxiety and stress.The patient's care is reviewed regularly by their palliative care team and discussed with the patient to make sure that their needs and wishes are being met and that treatments are in line with the patient's goals. Palliative care can reduce symptoms such as pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, constipation, nausea, loss of appetite and difficulty sleeping.It addresses the whole person and helps them to carry on with daily life.It can improve one's ability to go through medical treatments and help the patient to better understand their condition and choices for medical care. In short, it enhances the patient's Quality Of Life (QOL). Therefore, patients may wish to start palliative care early for best results, and they should request it from their doctor instead of waiting for their medical team to bring it up.

The statement provides principles to balance the public health concerns regarding the abuse and misuse of prescription opioids with the need to ensure access to appropriate pain management for cancer patients and survivors: The policy states, \"Cancer Patients Are a Special Population - ASCO believes that cancer patients should be largely exempt from regulations restricting access to or limiting doses of prescription opioids in recognition of the unique nature of their disease, its treatment, and potentially life-long adverse health effects from having had cancer.\" From: http://www.asco.org/advocacy-policy/asco-in-action/asco-releases-principles-balancing-appropriate-patient-access?et_cid=37861275&et_rid=1396253832&linkid=ASCO+Releases+Policy+Statement+on+Opioid+Therapy%3a+Protecting+Access+to+Treatment+for+Cancer-Related+Pain_btn Bottom line: if you are suffering from pain and your doctor or nurse are not working with you to successfully manage it, please show this to them.

      "Content": "Apr 3, 2015 09:15PM Bestbird wrote: Fitz hit the nail on the head!  Here is an explanation as to why targeted therapy has turned out to be a disappointment: In order to be a candidate for targeted therapy, the cancer must express a mutation(s) and there must be a drug targeting that mutation(s). Simply having a mutation does not mean that the mutation is dangerous.  For example, a person may be albino but that doesn't mean that being an albino is deadly. In addition, the mutation may not be dominant over other mutations in the same tumor.  (For example, let's say we baked a blueberry pie and threw in 2 raspberries.  The targeted therapy test identifies a \"Raspberry Mutation.\"  But the pie still looks and tastes like a blueberry pie). Breast cancer is exceedingly complex because a single tumor may express a mutation in one \"slice\" of the tumor but not in another slice of the same tumor. In addition, a mutation that's found in one tumor within a patient may not be present in another tumor within that patient. In addition, tumors are greater than the sum of their mutations.  They secrete proteins and enzymes, are able to influence their microenvironment (and vice versa,) and communicate via cellular pathways.  Much of this is independent of genetic mutations. The only time I've ever seen targeted therapy to be effective against bc is when a mutation causes overexpression of a receptor on the cell's surface.  An example of this is HER2. Immunotherapy trains the patient's immune system to identify and destroy malignant tumors.  The problem with most malignant tumors is that they are able to hide from and shield themselves from the immune system.  So immunotherapy drugs must be able to break through these defenses to aid the immune system to do its job. I hope this helps!",

I have heard of pain and ongoing issues in a few cases regarding the talc procedure.  Some people have done really well on it, however.  My thought is that the catheter (especially the newer Aspira, which works via gravity) might be a simpler approach, although it needs to be surgically inserted and removed.  I hope that whatever your mother decides upon works well for her.  The trick is also finding a systemic therapy that is effective against the cancer.  Hopefully in your Mom's case the Taxol will help.  You should also discuss hormonal therapies suchg as Femara or Arimidex with her doctor if she hasn't already been on them.

One thing you may want to ask for is Palliative Care, which has nothing to do with hospice care.  It provides emotional, nutritional, and other support.  You can ask your doctor about how to obtain it, or alternatively look it up here at:  http://getpalliativecare.org/providers/ Below are my notes about therapies other than drugs to help ease anxiety.  I hope that you may find something(s) that work well for you!  Acupuncture or Electroacupuncture:  Acupuncture involves inserting thin sterile needles into different points on the body by a skilled practitioner, and has been used for centuries. . One study found that Electroacupuncture\u2014in which a mild electric current is transmitted through tiny needles inserted into the skin \u2014was just as effective as Prozac in reducing symptoms of depression. From: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-acupuncture-treat-depression/ Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which can help patients identify and restructure negative thoughts and increase positive behaviors.  In one study, 124 patients with MBC who received 8 weekly sessions of group CBT reported reduced depression and mood disturbance, and improved self-esteem compared with a no-therapy control group. Doing something enjoyable such as watching a funny movie or reading a good book may help ease anxiety or depression. Individual Psychotherapy may be of enormous benefit to some patients. Massage: Clinical studies show that massage can alleviate symptoms such as depression and anxiety, stress, nausea, insomnia, pain, and fatigue. From:  http://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/herb/massage-therapy Mindfulness:  Mindfulness techniques including (but not limited to) meditation and yoga may be highly effective in reducing depression.  A study of 35 cancer patients examined the effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on depression and other symptoms. The MBSR group received training in mindfulness meditation, yoga, and self-regulatory responses to stress. Compared to control groups, the MBSR group reported large improvements regarding depression, fatigue, energy, and sleep disturbance.  Results were maintained or strengthened at 1-month follow-up, and improvements in all outcomes were maintained 6\u2009months after completing the course. From: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25132206 Pet(s): Often, having a pet may enable a depressed or anxious person to relax and feel much calmer.  MBC patients may not always want \u2013 or be able to care for \u2013 some types of animals (such as a very energetic puppy).  Even is relatively simple companion such as a goldfish may provide patients with relaxation and enjoyment. Reiki: Reiki is based on the belief that spiritual energy can be channeled through a Reiki practitioner to heal the patient's spirit. This is thought to help release the body's natural healing powers. Reiki is most often given as a hands-on treatment.There are many individual reports about Reiki's power to increase feelings of well-being and refresh the spirit. Some patients who were getting cancer treatment have reported an increased sense of well-being after Reiki sessions. From:http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/manualhealingandphysicaltouch/reiki Support Groups, whether face-to-face, telephone, or over the Internet, may help to enable people suffering from depression to feel less alone.  For patients desiring Telephone Support, a list may be found at:  http://mbcn.org/support  ",

Finally, as Kayrnic mentioned, there are non-systemic treatments available if you have liver mets.  A good website for an overview is http://beatlivertumors.org/Liver_Directed_Therapies.html I hope that something is identified that truly helps!",

That said, I'd suggest carefully checking this new mbc clinical trial search tool customized solely to find mbc clinical trials. It is located at: www.breastcancer.org/treatment... l Due to some software issues that are being worked out, to obtain the full list of clinical trial results, only key in the following information and leave the rest blank: * Year of Birth * Gender * (If female) Menopausal status (this will appear when you check female) * Breast cancer type Please leave everything else blank. Then click on \"show trials.\" It may take a while for the next screen to appear. When you see the next screen, you can choose to view what type of therapy you're interested in (i.e. hormonal, immunotherapy, targeted, etc.) Also, if you are not already doing so, perhaps you might consider adding a Naturopathic Oncologist (NO) to your medical team. The NO would conduct additional tests and customize a protocol based upon your unique profile that would work together with your standard therapy. It would also be a lot cheaper. That's not to say that you shouldn't look into Hallwang if you are interested; just that there may be less expensive options closer to home. Wishing you a good outcome whatever you decide!",

That said, I was thinking of a few things from my MBC Therapies Guide that perhaps you might consider. Wishing you a wonderful outcome, whatever you decide! In cytometric profiling, the tumor or malignant ascites are tested against different chemotherapy drugs and combinations thereof to see what the cancer cells may be susceptible to and what they may be resistant to.This is still considered controversial and many doctors are not convinced of its value.Furthermore, the test may not be covered by insurance.However, several people have indicated that it has helped them and feel that it was superior to the hit-or-miss approach to chemotherapy that is used today. This is a link to a meta-analysis study that concluded that there is a two-fold overall tumor response for a chemo assay-guided therapy versus standard of care therapy.Additionally, patients who received assay-guided therapy compared to those who received standard of care or physician's choice had a significantly higher 1-year survival rate:From: http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/118466-132 Working with a Naturopathic Oncologist (NO) in addition to your medical team: NOs order specific tests that medical oncologists generally do not request, and then use these special test results - along with conventional medical test results and physical examinations - as indicators of the patient's health.NOs will then recommend a customized protocol consisting of supplements, dietary recommendations, and/or other therapies that may help to enhance the patient's health, reduce treatment and cancer-related side effects, and hopefully help suppress their cancer.The patient's integrative protocol is also designed to work with their mainstream cancer therapy. Among Naturopathic Oncologists, those who carry the title \"FABNO\" (Fellow by the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology) have passed stringent examinations in order to meet the highest standard of the profession. A list of Naturopathic Physicians by location can be found at: http://www.oncanp.org/find_state.html (I work with my NO remotely, since he lives in AZ and I'm in UT.

But as others have said, over time it gets a bit easier, and you'll find many people who are doing well with a good quality of life! When you receive the report from the biopsy, it will be important to know what the estrogen (ER), Progesterone (PR) and HER2 status are, since they may differ from the original cancer. Additionally, you may want to request testing to see whether the tumor has Androgen Receptors (AR), since there are some promising clinical trials that target Androgen Receptors in a similar manner as current hormonal therapy targets Estrogen Receptors (ER).  This is very important: Please remember to keep copies of all tests results and scans in case there eventually is a need or desire to have a second opinion from a specialist outside your medical network. You may also want to seek a second opinion at any point about treatment.

METHODS: Forty-four patients with primary or secondary malignant cerebral tumors were randomly assigned to radiotherapy plus either BS 4200 mg/day or placebo. The volume of cerebral edema in the T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence was analyzed as a primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were toxicity, cognitive function, quality of life, and the need for antiedematous (dexamethasone) medication. Blood samples were taken to analyze the serum concentration of boswellic acids (AKBA and KBA).  RESULTS:  Compared with baseline and if measured immediately after the end of radiotherapy and BS/placebo treatment, a reduction of cerebral edema of >75% was found in 60% of patients receiving BS and in 26% of patients receiving placebo (P = .023). These findings may be based on an additional antitumor effect. There were no severe adverse events in either group. In the BS group, 6 patients reported minor gastrointestinal discomfort. BS did not have a significant impact on quality of life or cognitive function. The dexamethasone dose during radiotherapy in both groups was not statistically different. Boswellic acids could be detected in patients' serum.  CONCLUSIONS: BS significantly reduced cerebral edema measured by MRI in the study population.",

One additional thought might be to have your tumor biopsied for Androgen Receptivity (AR). The test can be done on your previously-tested tumor so you do not need a fresh biopsy. If you are AR+ (as is most bc) then you could be a candidate for a clinical trial that targets AR in much the same way that currently hormonal therapy targets ER. And as zarovka mentioned, counterintuitive as it may sound, estradiol can be an effective therapy in and of itself and for re-sensitizing the cancer to ER hormonal therapy, and it's FDA-approved.

Below is a study from my book, \"The Insider's Guide to Metastatic Breast Cancer.\" You can obtain the Guide in eBook or paperback formats on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Insiders-Guide-Metastatic-Breast-Cancer/dp/179586060X or send me an email at bestbird@hotmail.com to obtain a complimentary .pdf One interesting study involved patients in which a single organ or 2 organs were involved.In those cases where effects of systemic therapy, possibly in combination with other treatments, were evaluated, a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) was achieved in 48.5% or 47.1% of cases respectively, with an outstanding overall response rate of 95.6%. Medians estimated were: Overall Survival (OS) of 185.0-months, and relapse-free interval (RFI) of 48.0-months.Three cases (4%) survived for their lifetime without relapse after achieving NED, the definition of clinical cure. This study indicates that OM is a distinct group of patients with long-term prognosis superior to MBC, with reasonable provability for clinical cure. From: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22532161 About the order of endocrine therapies, this is from my book relative to postmenopausal patients: FDA-Approved First Line Hormonal Treatment Options in the US (depending upon what, if any, recent treatments the patient may have had in the adjuvant setting): At a presentation delivered in April 2019 by Medical Oncologist Dr. Neil Vasan of Memorial Sloan Kettering, the following first-line therapy is suggested for patients who had previously been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer.

Sometimes that's what we need to let the tears come and begin working things through. You've had a rough go, and dealing with your mother's passing on an expost facto basis, your son's behavior (from what I understand, not unusual for a teenager), your scare and pain with ulcerative colitis, and concern about your next treatment all came together at once. Add to that the grief of Ebru's passing, and it's a perfect cauldron for raw emotion and despair. You've received wonderful input. Thank heavens for this forum. I think that as you receive further responses, you'll find that the really difficult things seem to come in clusters. I know that's been true for me, with my husband's cancer diagnosis and depression, and a close relative's ALS diagnosis. You are doing and considering all the right things. An antidepressant is appropriate, as is seeing a therapist. But it may take a while before you find one who can help, so it is important to continue to search. I finally found one who was able to help me after 5 others could not, but admittedly there were occasions I stopped searching for a long time because I felt I'd never find anyone skilled and perceptive enough to make a difference. Try to be gentle with yourself. Eat (carefully), rest, and try to do something that gives you a moment of pleasure each day. Today for me it was watching squirrels frolicking in our back yard! Also, don't plan ahead. The theme, \"How will I get through this?\" is best managed one moment at a time. And always remember you have friends. You are loved by so many people.",

Perhaps it might be a viable option for you! https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/cancer/treatment/mctp/ The Medicaid Cancer Treatment Program (MCTP) is a Medicaid program for eligible persons who are found to be in need of treatment for breast, cervical, colorectal or prostate cancer (and in some cases, pre-cancerous conditions of these cancers). To be enrolled in the MCTP, an individual must complete an application with a New York State Department of Health Cancer Services Program (CSP) trained designee, referred to as a Designated Qualified Entity (DQE). A DQE is a person designated and trained by the New York State Department of Health as a \"Qualified\" entity, for the purpose of assisting individuals to complete the MCTP application. Once an individual is enrolled in the MCTP, full Medicaid coverage is provided for an initial period of enrollment as determined by the type of cancer or pre-cancerous condition being treated. Recertification is required yearly, if the individual is still in need of treatment, at which time eligibility is reassessed. Enrollees must receive services from a Medicaid enrolled provider in order to have their services covered. MCTP coverage is limited to the individual enrollee and cannot be extended to family members or dependents.

The initial weeks and months after a mets diagnosis are the hardest. Dealing with the shock and fear can be very difficult. But as others have said, over time it gets a bit easier, and you'll find many people who are doing well with a good quality of life! If it\u2019s possible, have the met(s) biopsied to see what their estrogen (ER), Progesterone (PR) and Her2 status are, since they may differ from the original cancer. If your cancer is ER+ your oncologist should be considering hormonal treatment, and if it's Her2+ then Herceptin should be added. Additionally, you may want to request testing to see whether the tumor has Androgen Receptors (AR), since there are some promising clinical trials that target Androgen Receptors in a similar manner as current hormonal therapy targets Estrogen Receptors (ER). This is very important: Please remember to keep copies of all tests results and scans in case you eventually want to have a second opinion from a specialist outside your medical network. You may also want to seek a second opinion about your treatment. Please post if you have questions, and wishing you a great outcome! ",

A lady on another forum called Inspire presented with a single lung met.  She had it surgically removed and has been NED (No Evidence of Disease) ever since. Here's more info on oligometastasis.  I hope that you do well for years, and potentially decades, to come! Oligometastases (OM) BC is characterized by solitary/few detectable lesions, usually limited to single organs, in which local therapy [possibly along with systemic therapy] with curative intent could impact survival [in a positive manner]..This population of \u2018potentially curable' stage IV disease is estimated to be 1-10% of newly diagnosed patients with metastatic BC (MBC) .A multimodal approach is endorsed for these selected patients .  Patients with OM disease can be divided into 3 groups: i)  those who [initially] present with oligometastases ii) those with residual oligometastases after systemic therapy (ST); and iii) those with relapsed oligometastases after curative locoregional therapy. From: http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/358750I In this analysis, OM was identified as: one or 2 organs involved with metastatic lesions (excluding the primary lesion resectable by surgery), fewer than 5 lesions per metastasized organ, and lesion diameter less than 5 cm. Patients were generally treated with systemic chemotherapy first, and those who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were further treated, if applicable, with local therapy (surgical or radiation therapy) to maintain CR or to induce no evidence of clinical disease (NED), with additional systemic therapy. Median follow-up duration was 103 (6-329) months. Single or 2 organs were involved in, respectively, 44 (59%) and 31 (41%) cases with metastatic lesions, 48% of which were visceral. In cases where effects of systemic therapy, possibly in combination with other treatments, were evaluated (N = 68), Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) was achieved in 33 (48.5%) or 32 (47.1%), respectively, with overall response rate (ORR: CR + PR) of 95.6% (N = 65). In cases receiving multidisciplinary treatment (N = 75), CR or NED (CR/NED), or PR was induced in 48 (64.0%) or 23 (30.7%) cases, respectively, with ORR (CR/NED + PR) of 94.7% (N = 71). CR rates (60.5%) with systemic therapy and CR/NED rates (79.5%) with multidisciplinary treatment were significantly better in subjects with a single involved organ than in those with two involved organs\u2026 systemic only or multidisciplinary treatments, respectively). Medians estimated by Kaplan-Meier method were: Overall Survival (OS) of 185.0 months and relapse-free interval (RFI) of 48.0 months. Estimated outcomes were: OS rates (OSR) of 59.2% at 10 years and 34.1% at 20 years, and relapse-free rates (RFR) of 27.4% at 10 years and 20 years. No disease progression was observed after 101.0 months as RFR. The present analyses clearly indicate that OMBC is a distinct subgroup with long-term prognosis superior to MBC, with reasonable provability for clinical cure.  From: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22532161",

I am very sorry you and your husband are dealing with this and hope things get better very soon! You may want to look into Obamacare (Affordable Care Act) plans since they may be cheaper than COBRA. I am also wondering whether you've ever filed for Social Security Disability (SSDI) as Texasrose53 mentioned, but it might be something viable to look into. 1) Also, there are several FDA-approved chemos and combos for MBC (listed at the bottom of this post), some of which you may not have tried. 2) It may be time to try hormonal therapy again, if you've been off it for a while. Also, you can try taking estrogen (which is FDA-approved for MBC) which may re-boot your sensitivity to hormonals and is a therapy in and of itself, unusual as that sounds. http://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/14457.aspx 3) If you feel up to it, then you may want to have a look at mbc clinical trials at: www.breastcancer.org/treatment... l Due to some software issues that are being worked out, to obtain the full list of clinical trial results, only key in the following information and leave the rest blank: * Year of Birth * Gender * (If female) Menopausal status (this will appear when you check female) * Breast cancer type Please leave everything else blank.

      "Content": "Jan 10, 2015 04:33AM Bestbird wrote: Pfizer is seeking approval to market Ibrance (palbociclib), a CDK4/6 inhibitor, for patients with advanced breast cancer whose growth is fueled by the hormone estrogen but not the growth factor HER2. If approved, Ibrance would be given with an older cancer drug, letrozole, which reduces estrogen production. The two drugs would work synergistically. From: http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/01/08/business/ap-us-pfizer-cancer-drug.html?_r=0 According to an update presented at the 2014 AACR Annual Meeting in April 2014, the median Progression Free Survival was 20.2 months with palbociclib compared with 10.2 months for letrozole alone .  The median Overall Survival (OS) was 37.5 months with palbociclib compared with 33.3 months with letrozole alone.   However, this first analysis of OS contained data from only 61 patients (37%) and was not deemed statistically significant. From: http://www.onclive.com/web-exclusives/Pfizer-Seeks-FDA-Approval-for-Frontline-Palbociclib For detail-seekers, here's more: The PALOMA-1 trial was split into two parts that tested the same treatment regimen \u2013 palbociclib plus letrozole versus palbociclib alone. But while the first part used ER positivity as the only biomarker for inclusion in the trial, based on preclinical findings that ER+ cell lines were much more likely to respond to treatment with palbociclib, the second part added another biomarker, making either cyclinD1 overexpression or loss of p16 another criterion for study entry. The hypothesis was that patients with high levels of the CDK 4/6 target, cyclinD1, would stand to benefit most from this therapeutic approach. But in their study, Finn and his colleagues found no difference between palbociclib-treated women in part 1 of their study, who were selected based only on the fact that their cancers overexpressed estrogen receptors, and women in part 2, who also had high levels of cyclin D1. Instead, it was the control arm \u2013 those patients treated only with letrozole \u2013 who nearly doubled their progression-free survival,  when patients were selected on the basis of both biomarkers.  From: http://www.bioworld.com/content/aacr-2014-phase-ii-data-palbociclib-striking-biomarker-mysteries-remain-0 The most common adverse events in the palbociclib arm were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and fatigue. Palbociclib-induced neutropenia was short lasting and reversible with conservative management. No cases of febrile neutropenia were reported.. Neutropenia is thought to be an on-target side effect of palbociclib that is related to the inhibition of CDK4 and its effect on bone marrow. Palbociclib inhibits both CDK4 and 6, which prevents DNA replication by prohibiting progression from G1 to S phase during cell division. Blocking this mechanism prevents tumor cell proliferation through control of the cell cycle. Several phase III trials exploring palbociclib as a treatment for patients with advanced breast cancer are currently ongoing. The PALOMA-2 trial is comparing the combination of palbociclib and letrozole with letrozole plus placebo as frontline treatment for postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (NCT01740427). The PALOMA-3 trial is comparing palbociclib plus fulvestrant with fulvestrant plus placebo in women with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer following progression on prior endocrine therapy (NCT01942135). \u2013 From: http://www.targetedonc.com/articles/Palbociclib-Receives-Priority-Review-for-Breast-Cancer",

Like you, my husband and I elected not to have children.  Although on occasion I find myself feeling wistful for kids and grandchildren, I recognize that I loved my career, did a lot of crazy things in my 30's and 40's that would have been impossible had I been a mother, and - last but far from least - that I probably wouldn't have made the best mother in the world.  When I consider all the choices that I made on key things, like who I married and who my friends are, I feel so fortunate in these decisions. And I am grateful for this and the other forums to which I belong, and for all the support and love in my life.",

OligoMetastasis (OM) in breast cancer is usually characterized by a solitary lesion or a few detectable lesions (tumors). These lesions are generally limited to a single organ, in which local therapy (possibly along with systemic therapy) with curative intent could impact survival in a positive manner. This population of \u201cpotentially curable\u201d MBC patients is estimated to represent 1% to-10% of newly diagnosed patients with MBC.  In another analysis, OM was identified as having one or 2 organs involved with metastatic lesions (excluding the primary lesion resectable by surgery), fewer than 5 lesions per metastasized organ, and lesion diameter less than 5cm. Patients were generally treated with systemic chemotherapy first, and those who achieved Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) were further treated, if applicable, with local therapy (surgical or radiation therapy) and/or with additional systemic therapy to maintain CR or to induce No Evidence of Disease (NED) with additional systemic therapy. One interesting study involved patients with a single organ or 2 organs were involved.  In those cases where effects of systemic therapy, possibly in combination with other treatments, were evaluated, a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) was achieved in 48.5% or 47.1% of cases respectively, with an outstanding overall response rate of 95.6%. Medians estimated were: Overall Survival (OS) of 185.0 months, and relapse-free interval (RFI) of 48.0 months. Three cases (4%) survived for their lifetime without relapse after achieving NED, the definition of clinical cure. This study indicates that OM is a distinct group of patients with long-term prognosis superior to MBC, with reasonable provability for clinical cure. Further prospective studies to better characterize OM are warranted.  From:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22532161",

The following drug guidelines for HER2 Positive MBC therapies were established by ASCO in 2014: First-line  therapy: First line therapy for HER2+ MBC patients should consist of Herceptin, Perjeta and a Taxane chemotherapy.  For select patients \u2013 those with   contraindications and/or slow growing hormone receptor-positive cancer \u2013   hormonal therapy administered either with or without either Herceptin or      Tykerb may be substituted for a chemotherapy-based HER2 targeted regimen      because there are usually fewer side effects.  However, hormonal therapy is not      appropriate for all patients with advanced, hormone receptor-positive      breast cancer since it has not been associated with a survival benefit in      this setting.  From:http://www.instituteforquality.org/systemic-therapy-patients-advanced-human-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor-2%E2%80%93positive-breast-cancer  Second-line therapy should be Kadcyla     (TDM-1) (you have already had this, so please skip) Third-line therapy: Treatment depends on what patients received as first-and second-line therapies.  Options may include Kadcyla, hormonal therapy or chemotherapy with Herceptin and in some cases with Tykerb, the combination of Herceptin and Tykerb, or a Perjeta-based regimen if the patient has not received Perjeta beforehand. From:http://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/practice-management/news/online/%7B33ca3c9d-e260-4a90-9039-8952f7f09714%7D/asco-issues-guidelines-for-advanced-HER2positive-breast-cancer Optimal duration of chemotherapy is at least 4 to 6 months or until maximum response, depending on toxicity and in the  absence of progression. The rationale for adding Perjeta to Herceptin (as described above by Fitzwins) is that a study found that HER2+ MBC patients whowere given Perjeta on top of Herceptin and chemotherapy lived 15.7 months longer than those on Herceptin and chemotherapy alone.  That is the longest extension to survival ever seen for a drug studied in metastatic breast cancer!   ",

Your mother's breathing difficulties are likely due to either liquid (effusion) around the lining of the lung, and/or heart issues.  Id strongly suggest that the doctor examines her for pleural effusion and orders a full check on her heart. If liquid is found around the lungs, it should be drained to ease her breathing.  There are three options for this:  Thoracentesis (sometimes referred to as \u201ctapping\u201d)is an outpatient procedure thatinvolves placing one needle per required side into the pleural space. Although local anesthesia is administered, this procedure can be uncomfortable and can cause scarring if repeated over time, and the procedure may not impede fluid buildup again. Pleurx or Aspira Catheter: This is the surgical insertion, under general anesthesia, of a small tube placed temporarily into the pleural space that allows you or your family member to drain the fluid into a bottle as needed.  Once there is no more drainage, the catheter is removed.  This procedure seems to help prevent the fluid from building up again, provided that systemic treatment such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy is working.  The Pleurx catheter works via suction, and the newer gentler model is the Aspira catheter, which uses gravity for draining. Pleurodesis (sometimes referred to as a \u201ctalc procedure\u201d) is a process in which substances, such as talc, are used to try to get the edge of the lung to stick to the chest wall to decrease the chance of the fluid returning.  Although this procedure seems to help prevent the fluid from building up again (provided that systemic treatment such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy is working) it can be painful and usually requires a brief hospital stay.

In chemo sensitivity testing, the tumor or malignant ascites will be tested against different chemotherapy drugs and combinations thereof to see what the cancer cells may be susceptible to and what they may be resistant to.  This is still considered controversial and many doctors are not convinced of its value. Furthermore, the test may not be covered by insurance.  However, several people have indicated that it has helped them and feel that it was superior to the hit-or-miss approach to chemotherapy that is used today.  Two viable places are Rational Therapeutics at http://www.rationaltherapeutics.com/ and the Weisenthal Cancer Group at http://weisenthalcancer.com/Home.html  2) Androgen Receptor (AR) and FGFR Receptor Testing: Most MBC patients are aware that many breast cancer cells \u201cover-express\u201d various receptors for Estrogen, Progesterone, and/or HER2/neu (sometimes referred to as ERBB2) , and that there are currently therapies that target receptors. The good news is that more types of breast cancer cell receptors and growth factors are continually being discovered, such as Androgen and FGFR1.  These may prove to be viable targets for treatment, and we just may be scratching the surface: According to Jennifer Richer, PhD, investigator at the CU Cancer Center,\"We're on the cusp of a major revolution in the way we treat breast cancer. It\u2019s increasingly clear that androgens and Androgen Receptors can influence many breast cancers as well. AR is actually even more prevalent in breast cancer than estrogen or progesterone receptors. Targeting androgen receptors in breast cancer gives us a new way to attack the disease.\" From: http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-12-san-antonio-androgen-breast-cancer.html If you test your cancer and it is AR positive, you may be eligible for a clinical trial that uses a drug targeting AR receptors.  The same applies to FGFR receptors. Your profile indicates that your cancer is hormone sensitive.  In that case, you may want to discuss the following with your doctor: 3) Re-trying (\u201cRecycling Through\u201d) Hormonal Therapies: Patients who have developed endocrine resistance and have been on chemotherapy may find this of particular interest.  At the 2013 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, one expert from Dana Farber stated that one of the most common suggestions that physicians should make for patients with initially hormone sensitive MBC who have had multiple lines of chemotherapy is to revisit the endocrine therapies, even in late stage disease. And he added that this methodology is probably not being done with the frequency it deserves.  From: Page 3 (under \u201cFinal Clinical Tip\u201d)  http://advancedbc.org/files/SABCS_Hal_Burstein_on_HR+MBC.pdf 4) ·  Integrative Care: Many cancer centers such as MD Anderson and Dana Farber have incorporated \u201cIntegrative Cancer Care\u201d to treat patients.  Recognizing that cancer and its treatments may have major effects on patients and those who are close to them, the intention of integrative care is to incorporate conventional and supplemental therapies intended to improve health, quality of life, and clinical outcomes. Supplemental integrative therapies may include acupuncture, exercise, massage, meditation, nutritional counseling, and others. Some practitioners such as Naturopathic Oncologists (NOs) take integrative care one step further. In addition to offering some or all of the therapies mentioned above, they order specific tests that medical oncologists generally do not request, and then use these special test results - along with conventional medical test results and physical examinations - as indicators of the patient\u2019s health.  NOs will then recommend a customized protocol consisting of supplements, dietary recommendations, and/or other therapies that may help to enhance the patient\u2019s health, reduce treatment and cancer-related side effects, and hopefully help suppress their cancer.  The patient\u2019s integrative protocol is also designed to work with their mainstream cancer therapy. Among Naturopathic Oncologists, those who carry the title \u201cFABNO\u201d (Fellow by the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology) have passed stringent examinations in order to meet the highest standard of the profession.  A list of Naturopathic Physicians by location can be found at: http://www.oncanp.org/find_state.html I hope that your next therapy works wonders, whatever you decide upon!",

You'll find that many of the participants have survived for many years with a very good quality of life, and it's probable that the survival statistics that you may have run across on the Internet or elsewhere are outdated.  This is a wonderful place for receiving support, sharing information, and for asking questions. Right now you're probably in a state of shock. But please know that as you and your doctor discuss treatment options and you begin your therapy, things will get better. Before starting treatment, you might want to consider obtaining a second opinion, possibly locally or at a major cancer center such as MD Anderson. In the event that you have a biopsy in the future, another thing to bear in mind is the possibility of sending the tumor for chemo sensitivity testing. This is still controversial and many doctors do not believe in it, but there have been some studies reflecting better results when the chemo that's administered is one that the test shows the tumor to be susceptible to. Two places I've heard good things about are Rational Therapeutics and the Weisenthal Center. If you are interested in supplemental treatments and/or diet, you may want to add a Naturopathic Oncologist to your medical team.  S/he can discuss supplements, therapies, and dietary recommendations. But you'll probably want to get started with your conventional tx first. If you are ER+ and postmenopausal, the doctor may start you on an Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) in lieu of chemo. If your tumor is Her2 +, then Herceptin may be part of yoour therapy. Please keep us posted, and here's a warm welcome!",

First, if your tummy is enlarged and there are no ascites, you may have some sort of obstruction. Please discuss this (and any other) possibility with your doctor, and if necessary seek a second opinion as to what is causing the swelling and what tests might help to identify the issue. This would be of great importance. Secondly, as kiss77 indicated, sometimes the pathology of the cancer may change, so if you might be able to have an area biopsied, that may help determine your next treatment (i.e. if an area is found to be HER2+, then you would be a candidate for a new category of therapies). Third, it may be possible that the rise in TMs are indicative of dead cancer cells if the therapy is working. TMs do not distinguish between live and dead cancer cells, and sometimes there is an initial rise if a therapy works. That said, I'm not sure about the timing of your therapies and the rise of the TMs, so this may not truly apply to the situation. I hope your meeting goes well, and please remember we are thinking of you!",

I have a friend who was diagnosed with liver mets over 6 years ago and is still working full-time! Understandably, the initial weeks and months after a mets diagnosis are the hardest. Dealing with the shock and fear can be very difficult. But as others have said, over time it gets a bit easier, and many people who are doing well with a good quality of life! If it's possible, have the met(s) biopsied to see what their estrogen (ER), Progesterone (PR) and HER2 status are, since they may differ from the original cancer. If the cancer is ER+ and/or PR+, then the oncologist should be considering hormonal treatment, and if it's HER2+ then Herceptin and Perjeta should be provided along with a Taxane. Additionally, you may want to request testing to see whether the tumor has Androgen Receptors (AR), since there are some promising clinical trials that target Androgen Receptors in a similar manner as current hormonal therapy targets Estrogen Receptors (ER). Even if the cancer is hormone receptor negative (ER- and PR-) hormonal therapy may still be considered according to the latest (2014) National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, \"Patients may be candidates for hormonal therapy irrespective of their hormone receptivity status, provided that their cancer is in the bones, soft tissue (muscle, fat or nerves), or internal organs and is not causing symptoms. From: http://www.nccn.org/patients/guidelines/stage_iv_breast/index.html#33/z This is very important: Please remember to keep copies of all tests results and scans in case there eventually is a need or desire to have a second opinion from a specialist outside of the present medical network. Obtaining a second opinion about the proposed treatment is highly encouraged. Please post if you have questions, and please accept best wishes for your wife.",

      "Content": "Bestbird wrote: The 2018 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) was fascinating this year! As opposed to several years ago when only sparse information about MBC was available at SABCS, this year it appeared that nearly half of the studies pertained to metastatic (as opposed to early stage) breast cancer. The notes below have been incorporated into my 175-page book entitled, \"The Insider's Guide to Metastatic Breast Cancer.\"If you would like a complimentary copy, please email your request to bestbird@hotmail.com(If you already have a copy of the book and want to receive an updated version, simply write \"Repeat Customer\" in the Subject Line of your email). Notes: Considerable research is being done regarding immunotherapy as a type of treatment for MBC, especially with regard to TNBC. As is the case for immunotherapy treatments, substantial research is underway regarding targeted therapies based upon biomarkers, and the results of some of these studies are provided below. Biomarkers represent substances, structures, or processes that can be measured in the body, and influence or predict the incidence of outcome or disease.They may reflect the effects of treatments, interventions, and even unintended environmental exposure.Therefore in oncology clinics and clinical trials, biomarkers are being increasingly used as eligibility criteria for specific therapies, and as measurements of response to treatment. Remember that it may take quite a while for treatment results to surface with regard to CDK4/6 inhibitors!For example, the median time to response for Verzenio (abemaciclib) has historically been 3.7 months. Dr. Nikhil Wagle (a Medical Oncologist at Dana Farber who is also the Director of the MBC Project) stated in a presentation that \"DNA sequencing does not tell the whole story\" because it excludes: RNA expression Protein characteristics Epigenics, which are modifications to the expression of genes which do not involve changes to the genetic code itself The microenvironment/immune cell expression 6. Currently there are no definitive guidelines regarding the sequence of chemotherapy for TNBC MBC patients.As per a lecture at 2018 SABCS delivered by Dr. Roisin M. Connolly of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, there are two potential clinical pathways for treating TNBC MBC: a. If the patient's tumor is PDL-1 positive, then the patient should ideally receive Atezolizumab with Abraxane because in the IMPassion130 trial, the median Overall Survival (OS) on the combination was 25 months vs. 15.5 months on Abraxane alone.However, this combination has not yet been FDA-approved as of Dec. 2018. b.If the patient's tumor is PDL negative, or the patient cannot obtain the above drug combination if their tumor is PDL-1 positive, then sequential single agent chemotherapy is recommended. Dr. Connolly advised that combination chemotherapy should only be given in the event of visceral crisis (severe organ dysfunction). c. After the above, if the patient has a germline BRCA mutation, Talazoparib or Olaparib can be given. 7. Research is increasingly underway on the previously under-studied subset of MBC patients who are both Hormone Receptor (HR) positive and HER2 positive, sometimes referred to as \"Triple Positive\" (more about this later). 8. Loss of function of NF1 (\"neurofibromatosis type 1\"), a tumor suppressor gene product, is a marker of acquired resistance to endocrine therapy specific to lobular bc patients.From: https://academic.oup.com/annonc/advance-article/doi/10.1093/annonc/mdy497/5181087 9. Talazoparib (Talzenna) and Olaparib (Lynparza) were both FDA-approved in 2018 for HER2 negative MBC patients with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. 10. Oral SERDs (endocrine therapies similar to Faslodex) and oral SERMs (similar to Tamoxifen) are being studied, including GDC9545, SAR439859, RAD1901, LSZ102, and ZN-C5. 11. At least two new classes of drugs are currently being studied in MBC: a. SERCAs (Selective Estrogen Receptor Covalent Antagonists):Current hormonal therapies include SERMS (Tamoxifen), SERDS (Faslodex), and Aromatase Inhibitors (Letrozole, Arimidex, and Aromasin).SERCAS are a new series of compounds with unique modes of inhibition that potently target both wild-type and mutant ERα, which can be indicative of hormonal therapy resistance. SERCAs inactivate the estrogen receptor by targeting a cysteine (amino acid) that is not present in other nuclear hormone receptors, leading to a different biological and activity profile than SERMS and SERDS.SERCAs such as H3B-6545 have begun being tested in clinical trials. b. BCL-2 Inhibitors: BCL-2 is a cell survival protein best known for its roles in inhibiting apoptosis (cell death) and promoting oncogenesis (the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells).The majority of breast cancers are BCL-2 positive.Drugs such as Venetoclax (ABT-199) that target BCL-2 are now being studied.Venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor that is currently approved for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.In a study of 33 evaluable Hormone Receptor (HR) positive, BCL-2 positive patients who received the combination of Venetoclax and tamoxifen, the median Progression Free Survival (PFS) was 36 weeks overall. The median PFS was 23 weeks in those who received doses of Venetoclax at less than 800 mg., versus 51 weeks in those who received 800 mg of Venetoclax (the maximum dose in the study).In the 24 patients who received the maximum dosage, the ORR was 54% and the Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) was 75%, with 1 Complete Response (4%) and 12 Partial Responses (50%). The median DOR was 42 weeks, and 8 patients from the 800-mg cohort remain on study treatment.From: https://www.onclive.com/conference-coverage/sabcs-2018/venetoclax-has-impressive-activity-in-er-and-bcl2-breast-cancer 12. MBC studies based upon mutations: a. PIK3CA Mutations in pre-treated Hormone Receptor+/HER2- Patients: In the SOLAR-1 Phase 3 clinical trial which compared Faslodex plus the targeted therapy Alpelisib (BLY719) versus Faslodex and placebo, postmenopausal patients with PIK3CA mutations (found via liquid or tumor biopsy) in the Faslodex/Alpelisib arm fared substantially better (median PFS 11.0 months) than similar patients in the Faslodex plus placebo arm (median PFS 5.7 months). Patients in this trial had received 1 or more lines of prior hormonal therapy but no chemotherapy.The ORR in the PIK3CA-mutant cohort was 26.6% in the Faslodex/Alpelisib arm compared with 12.8% in the Faslodex/placebo arm. These results, assessed after a median follow-up of 20 months, translated into a 35% reduction in the risk of progression or death in favor of Faslodex/Alpelisib arm. There was no advantage to providing Alpelisib in patients without a PIK3CA mutation. So encouraging were the results of this trial that a new \"Managed Access Program\" (NCT03706573) has been established to allow access to Alpelisib for eligible patients diagnosed with HR+ MBC who have a PI3KCA mutation.From: https://www.targetedonc.com/conference/esmo-2018/solar1-trial-results-demonstrate-a-benefit-for-genomic-testing-in-breast-cancer and https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03706573 b. HER2 or HER3 Mutations in Hormone Receptor Positive Patients: The SUMMIT Phase 2 trial sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Neratinib (Nerlynx) in Hormone Receptor (HR) positive patients who have solid tumors with activating HER2 or HER3 mutations. In the HER2-mutant, HR+ positive breast cancer cohort, 47 patients received Neratinib in combination with Faslodex (fulvestrant). In this group, 43 patients (92%) had HER2 negative disease, and the patients had received a median of 3 prior lines of therapy in the metastatic setting (range 0-11 prior regimens). All patients had been previously treated with hormonal therapy prior to entering the study, including 25 patients (53%) who had received prior Faslodex. 20 patients (43%) had received prior cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6)-inhibitor therapy. Overall, 14 patients (30%) experienced an objective response, which included 4 patients with a complete response and 10 patients with partial responses, and 22 patients (47%) experienced clinical benefit (clinical benefit is defined as confirmed complete response or partial response or stable disease for at least 24 weeks). The median DOR was 9.2 months and the median PFS was 5.4 months. Patients who had received prior Faslodex or CDK4/6 inhibitor targeted therapy prior to entering the trial also benefited from the combination treatment. Of note, 6 patients (30%) with prior CDK4/6-inhibitor exposure demonstrated confirmed responses, with the duration of responses ranging from 4.5 - 14.8 months. Four patients were still on treatment at the time of data reporting.From: https://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/stocks/news/press_release.asp?docTag=201812060800BIZWIRE_USPRX____BW5252&feedID=600&press_symbol=44478224 c. Olaparib (a PARP inhibitor) is being studied in combination with Durvalumab (\"Imfinzi\"), a PD-L1 inhibitor, in HER2 negative MBC patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations in the Mediola study..The Mediola clinical trial consists of 25 pretreated MBC patients who had BRCA germline mutations and HER2 negative MBC.Twelve of these patients had HR positive tumors and 13 had TNBC.The combination demonstrated a Disease Control Rate (DCR) of 80%, and a 52% Overall Response Rate (ORR) which consisted entirely of partial responses.Responses were seen regardless of hormone receptor status, BRCA mutation type, or receipt of prior platinum-based chemotherapy. The longest response was ongoing at 308+ days, and the median DOR was not yet reached at the time of the analysis.Although medians have not yet been attained, the Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that approximately 70% of patients remained progression free, and most patients remained alive at the time of the analysis.From: http://www.onclive.com/web-exclusives/olaparibdurvalumab-combo-effective-for-brcamutant-breast-cancer 13. A study for HER2 positive, Hormone Receptor negative MBC patients: In the PATRICIA Phase 2 study (also mentioned below for Triple Positive MBC patients), the combination of Ibrance and Herceptin demonstrated safety and efficacy in pre-treated patients with advanced HER2+ MBC. Investigators enrolled patients who had received 2 to 4 prior lines of therapy into 3 cohorts: 1 cohort contained patients with HR negative/HER2+ disease, and the other 2 cohorts included patients with ER+/HER2+ disease. Patients with HR negative/HER2+ breast cancer received Ibrance + Herceptin.At 6 months, 5 of 15 (33%) the patients in the ER-/HER2+ cohort attained Progression Free Survival (PFS).From: https://www.onclive.com/conference-coverage/sabcs-2018/palbociclib-combo-active-in-her2-breast-cancer 14. Treatments being studied for Hormone Receptor+/HER2+ (\"Triple Positive\") MBC patients: a. Aromatase Inhibitor + Herceptin (Trastuzumab) + Pertuzumab (Perjeta): The Phase 2 PERTAIN study enrolled 258 women with HER2-positive, HR positive locally advanced or MBC who were not previously treated with systemic non-hormonal therapy in the advanced-disease setting.Patients received either Herceptin (with or without a taxane for 18\u201324 weeks) plus an aromatase inhibitor (Arimidex or Letrozole), or else they received Herceptin (with or without a taxane for 18\u201324 weeks) plus Perjeta plus an aromatase inhibitor. The triplet combination of Herceptin (with or without a taxane), plus Perjeta and an aromatase inhibitor resulted in a median PFS of 18.9 months, compared to 15.8 months for Herceptin (with or without a taxane) plus an aromatase inhibitor.Furthermore, the DOR was significantly longer with the triplet (27.1 vs 15.1 months). From: http://www.ascopost.com/issues/january-25-2017/pertuzumab-trastuzumab-plus-aromatase-inhibitor-beneficial-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/ b. Aromatase Inhibitor + Herceptin (Trastuzumab) + Lapatinib (Tykerb): The \"triplet\" therapy combination of Lapatinib (Tykerb), Trastuzumab (Herceptin), and an aromatase inhibitor (AI) reduced the risk for death or progression by 38% in women with HER2+/HR+ MBC compared with those treated with a targeted agent plus an Aromatase Inhibitor (AI), according to findings from the Phase 3 ALTERNATIVE study.This clinical trial enrolled 355 patients who had undergone prior endocrine therapy and experienced disease progression during or after a prior regimen containing Herceptin plus chemotherapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting and/or in the first-line metastatic settingThe median PFS was 11 months for the triplet therapy combination versus 5.7 months for women assigned to Herceptin plus AI, and the median PFS also favored the triplet compared to Herceptin plus AI (8.3 months vs 5.7 months).Although OS data were immature at the time of this analysis, they trended in favor of the triplet therapy as opposed to Herceptin plus AI (median OS 46.0 vs 40.0 months).The researchers concluded that the PFS benefit obtained with Lapatinib plus Herceptin plus AI in patients with HER2-positive, HR-positive MBC who had been previously treated is clinically meaningful and robust, and that the triplet combination can potentially offer an effective and well-tolerated, chemotherapy-sparing alternative treatment regimen for patients for whom chemotherapy is not a viable option.From: http://www.onclive.com/web-exclusives/dual-her2-blockade-superior-for-pfs-in-her2hr-metastatic-breast-cancer c. Ibrance and Herceptin, with or without Letrozole: In the PATRICIA Phase 2 study, the combination of palbociclib (Ibrance) and trastuzumab (Herceptin) demonstrated safety and efficacy in pre-treated patients with advanced HER2+ breast cancer, some of whom were also hormone receptor positive.Investigators enrolled patients who had received 2 to 4 prior lines of therapy into 3 cohorts: 2 cohorts contained patients with ER+/HER2+ disease, and 1 cohort contained patients with ER-/HER2+ disease.Patients with ER+/HER2+ breast cancer were randomized to receive Ibrance + Herceptin with or without letrozole. At 6 months, 6 (40%) of 15 patients with ER+HER2+ MBC who received Ibrance and Herceptin without letrozole achieved PFS, and 8 (53%) of 15 ER+/HER2+ MBC patients who received Ibrance and Herceptin with letrozole were also progression-free.From: https://www.onclive.com/conference-coverage/sabcs-2018/palbociclib-combo-active-in-her2-breast-cancer 15. Treatments Being Studied for TNBC MBC patients: a. The Phase 3 IMPassion130 trial, in which 902 MBC patients with previously untreated TNBC received either Abraxane alone, or a combination of Abraxane plus Atezolizumab (Tecentriq), indicated that patients receiving the combination had an improved median PFS (7.2 months vs. 5.5 months).Importantly, an interim OS analysis showed median survival of 21.3 months with the Atezolizumab/Abraxane regimen, versus 17.6 months with Abraxane alone.Notably, the Atezolizumab/Abraxane regimen conferred a considerable OS benefit to patients with PD-L1-positive TNBC (median 25 months on the combination arm vs. 15.5 months on Abraxane alone).At SABCS 2018, it was disclosed that the best responders were patients whose immune cells on or near the tumor expressed PDL-1. At SABCS 2018, Dr. Leisha A. Emens, co-leader of the Hillman Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Program, disclosed that the best responders were patients whose immune cells on or near the tumor expressed PDL-1, stating, \"PD-L1 immune cell expression was the best predictor of clinical benefit.\" In Nov. 2018, the FDA granted Priority Review regarding approval for Atezolizumab in combination with Abraxane for first-line treatment of unresectable metastatic PD-L1-positive, TNBC MBC. From: https://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/breast-cancer/news/online/%7B9942e58b-6f48-45cb-837f-444cf53d4063%7D/atezolizumab-combination-extends-survival-for-some-patients-with-metastatic-triple-negative-breast-cancer b. The combination of Keytruda (Pembrolizumab) and Zejula (Niraparib), a PARP inhibitor, has shown promising and durable response rates in pre-treated TNBC MBC patients, regardless of their BRCA mutational status according to the Phase 1/2 trial called TOPACIO in which 46 TNBC patients were assessed. Among these patients, 15 had BRCA mutations and 5 had genetic alterations in other DNA repair genes.Three patients had complete responses, 10 had partial tumor reductions, and 10 had their disease stabilized with the treatment. This represents an ORR of 28% and a DCR of 50%.As expected, patients with BRCA mutations had the best response rates at 60%, followed by those with mutations in other DNA repair genes at 55%, and those who were positive for the PD-L1 protein \u2014 a biomarker that predicts response to Keytruda \u2014 at 36%.Overall, the 15 patients with BRCA mutations lived for a median of 8.3 months without their disease progressing, which is superior to the 3 \u2013 5 months seen with standard chemotherapy, or with either agent alone.

HR+/HER2- Patients with Visceral Disease: It is noteworthy that Kisqali plus endocrine therapy appears to be highly effective for MBC patients with HR+/HER2- visceral disease. Nearly 60% of patients enrolled in the MONALEESA trials had visceral metastases such as lung and/or liver, and all benefited from treatment with Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy.In patients with visceral metastases, Kisqali plus endocrine therapy yielded a median PFS of 24.4 months compared with a median PFS of 11.9 months for patients with visceral disease on endocrine therapy alone.Furthermore, the ORR of patients with visceral disease on the combination therapy closely resembled the ORR of patients with bone-only disease who were on the combination.From: https://www.pharmacypracticenews.com/Clinical/Article/12-18/Kisqali-Improves-Outcomes-and-Survival-Rates-in-Women-With-Metastatic-Breast-Cancer-/53612 17. Study of HER3 Overexpressed MBC Patients: U3-1402, an investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting HER3, induced objective response in more than 40% of 42 heavily pretreated patients with HER3-expressing breast cancer, according to results presented at the 2018 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.The ORR was 42.9% (18/42), the median PFS was 8.3 months, and the overall disease control rate (DCR) was 90.5% (38/42). Most responses proved to be durable, as the median duration of response (DOR) was not yet reached (range, 2.8-13.8 months) after a median follow-up of 10.5 months. Twenty-one patients remained on treatment as of the November 6, 2018 data cutoff.From: https://www.onclive.com/conference-coverage/sabcs-2018/her3targeting-antibodydrug-conjugate-shows-encouraging-activity-in-advanced-breast-cancer Dx 10/6/2011, IDC, Left, Stage IV, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

As I read your post, a few thoughts came to mind.  One is that I have read about women whose circumstances were similar to yours and who are still going on with a decent quality of life.  They have sought second opinions and/or treatments from another local oncologist, gone to MD Anderson or another major cancer center, or gone to Cancer Treatment Centers of America or the Block center in IL.  Some have learned about and entered clinical trials.  I wouldn't let the opinion of one oncologist be the be-all, end-all. Second, please keep a copy of all test results and medical records in case you consult someone out of your insurance network. There is also another great forum on https://www.inspire.com in case you are really in the mood for reading, and yet another at http://bcmets.org/archive/2012/2   There are far too many people with Stage IV bc, but the good side is that you'll receive so much support and informatioon.

With regard to the clinical trial above, the 2 arms are: 1)  Faslodex alone (i.e. with placebo) or 2) Faslodex with the experimental drug.  So either way you would be getting Faslodex. A trial that I think holds substantial promise is the one with Palbociclib + Faslodex vs. Faslodex alone: http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/search/view?cdrid=752764&version=HealthProfessional&protocolsearchid=6378902  From earlier trials, it appears that Palbocliclib holds considerable opportunity for ER+ Her2- mbc. If you were not to embark on a trial, probably Letrozole (Femara) would be a good start.  Although I have read some studies that combining both may be efficacious, there is so a school of thought that recommends them sequentially.  Wishing you ever-shrinking mets, whatever you decide!",

You also may want to discuss liver-directed therapies with your doctor.  An excellent site describing these is: http://www.beatlivertumors.org/Liver_Directed_Therapies.html And as others have mentioned, perhaps an anti anxiety or antidepressant medication may be of help.  Please feel free to discuss your feelings with your doctor.

Given that her cancer is hormone receptor positive, it is a bit puzzling as to why she is not starting out with hormonal therapy, which can be as (and in some cases more) effective as chemo. When I was diagnosed, my lung was studded with lesions, I had a litre of malignant pleural effusion drained, as well as pericardial effusion. My oncologist wanted to start me on chemo asap. I sought a second opinion, and that oncologist recommended hormonal therapy. I've been on the latter and am grateful for seeking a second opinion. Wishing you and your wife an excellent outcome, whatever you decide!  ",

Good luck!",

Divine, congratulations on your good news!  Hopefully rose and many others who are undergoing tests can join you in a virtual celebration!",
