If she doesn't find it on the shelf of her local pharmacy they might be able to order it for her. I think it might also be available online if you do a search for it. Olive oil or honey is also good for the skin, but she would need to put that on at night and wear gloves or socks while she is using very oily products to prevent waking up with oil all over the place. Good luck. Take good care of yourselves.",

You went for testing. You are still in the process of finding out what is going on. Now go forward from today and do whatever you can do to get well. Hugs to you and your family. ElaineM",

First of all if you are hesitating about the surgery talk to your surgeon and your oncologist before the surgery.Do not sign the consent form until you do that. If you have already signed the consent form it is still not too late. I once refused recommended surgery. I found another way to take care of the problem and avoided gall bladder surgery. My gall bladder is still fine, thank you.  It only takes a few minutes to have that conversation with them. It will be well worth your effort. It is important for them to know how you feel. There might be other options to take care of the problem that they have not discussed with you.  If the three of you still believe surgery is the best option they might be able to do something to make your recovery from surgery easier and your hospital stay more comfortable. It is part of their job to try to do that. If they don't want to make the effort to discuss the situation with you it might be that you need to find another opinion. Good luck. Take good care of yourself. I have my fingers crossed for a speedy recovery. A cyber hug to you. ElaineM",
