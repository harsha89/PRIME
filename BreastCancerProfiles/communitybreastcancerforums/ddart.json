My mom had breast cancer twice and ovarian, so I had the genetic test. I found out that I have BRAC1+. After chemo, I decided to have double mastectomy with tram flap reconstruction on April 9th and hysterectomy on July 25 with more reconstruction. I was going to wait on hysterectomy, but I wanted to get it all over. Plus, cost less for me to have it in one year.  It was hard to go through all the surgeries, but I am glad it is over. I am still recovering, but doing well.  You will need help ...especially the first week after surgery. Debbie",
