I read several studies that convinced me to try it, and ordered it through anti-agingsystems.com before my treatments began.  I showed it to my rad onc, who looked at the ingredients list and said I could use it,  though he doubted it would do any good.   But it did! He was amazed that my skin didn't even turn pink, up until the final week .. by then,  I had run out of the emulsion.  After that, my skin did turn a little pink, but very quickly went back to its normal color.  After my own good experience, I recommended Praevoskin to several people but unfortunately I was told it is no longer available in the U.S.(though it is still available in Germany.)  I have no idea why, but I think it's a shame, because it might help a lot of other women undergoing radiation treatments.  If anyone knows anything about this product, or why it's no longer available here, please clue me in.

Stage IIb, Grade 2,  2/18 nodes, ER+/PR+ HER2-. plus [rare foci of] dermal lymphatic invasion).  My Oncotype score was also 21, so I was  sure I was headed for chemo.  But my second-opinion oncologist surprised me by saying she would be comfortable with it if I decided against it. Alternatively she recommended mastectomy followed by radiation, and since I am postmenopausal, 5 years of Arimidex. I asked her, if it were her, would SHE have chemo, and she said \"No.\"  She also commented that even if I did have the  chemo, there would still no guarantees. So I ended up deciding against it and am happy with my decision. That is not to say that YOU should not have chemo, but only that it's important for you to have complete confidence in your decision once you reach it. BTW, my oncologist is at a teaching hospital and doesn't sell chemotherapy for her living. As for bad cells traveling in lymph vessels, I guess that's what lymph nodes are for -- to catch the bad cells and stop or delay them from going distant sites. I wonder if your Onc will recommend that you have your remaining axillary nodes irradiated as a precaution.  I'm so sorry that you are having to deal with this.  The indecisions and uncertainties are the worst!    God bless, and good luck.",

My score was 21, in the low \"intermediate\" range.  She recommended MX and radiation, plus 5 yrs. anti-hormone treatment, but no chemo. If your Oncotype score is low enough, you will not likely benefit enough from chemo to make it worthwhile, especially since you are ER/PR+ and HER2-.   Try to see someone at a large teaching hospital. Their team may be able to help you not only with the BC, but also  with the cyst. Hugs & prayers, Aza",

Also, since your oncologist now seems indecisive as to whether you should have chemo, have you considered consulting with another oncologist?  When faced with such uncertainty, you need someone  to direct and take charge, and it should not be left up to you alone to make the decisions. Like yours, my Oncotype score is 21. In my case, my oncologist told me she was comfortable with my not having chemo if I chose not to.  So I chose not to. I will have radiation and take Arimidex instead.  HOWEVER, I am considerably older than you, and I'm sure your young age will be an important factor in whatever treatment decisions are made. Best of luck to you, and take care . . .  ",

I can see why you are having a tough time making a decision based on those mixed messages. Like, if HE's comfortable with your not doing chemo, why shouldn't you be? You might find it helpful to check out the NCCN's new Clinical Guidelines regarding chemo at www.nccn.org/about/news/newsin...  The article is titled \"Fewer Women to Recieve Chemo for Breast Cancer.\"  Of course everyone's cancer is unique, but it might at least give you some info to justify asking for further discussion with your MO.
