I was using pencil and brow powder when I went out but last week I looked in a magnifying mirror and realized I didn't need it anymore.  The one or 2 leg hairs and the single pit hair I shaved haven't returned.  The chin hairs are growing like crazy but are mostly very light.  The head started coming in white and seemed to be making progress a few weeks ago but now has just about stopped. I have 1/4 inch on the sides and areas that are 1 inch top and neckline.   I guess there's some growth because there are a few patches that are starting to look darker.  At first, I thought my scalp was changing color.  There's still definitely more scalp than hair.  Since the hair's mostly white and the sides and back were peeking out from under the wig, I used Loving Care (it has a new name I can't remember) over the weekend.  Directions state not to rub it into the scalp which is impossible when there's more scalp than hair.  I chickened out after 15 minutes thinking my scalp was going to be stained and rinsed it out.  There was some color left in the hair but had a strange hue.  It's all washed out now.   I think I'll try again and leave it in longer.  Since I don't leave the house without something on my head a stained scalp won't matter.  My family are the only ones who see me bare and are used to my changing head. There's plenty Loving Care left in the bottle for another application but directions say not to save it.  I did save it and plan to use it up.  Has anyone had a bad experience with that?  It seems too gentle to cause problems. So thankful for the weekend.  I started back to work last week after 6 months and I'm exhausted. Have a great weekend. ",

My eyes are very sensitive and I can't wear eye makeup unless I use allergy drops first so it was a little depressing. The loss didn't last long.  By the time I had lost enough to show, I was using eyebrow stencils with powder and some pencil to make them more lifelike. After only a month, I took a close look and found there were enough of my own brows to just use the pencil.  I believe many others have experienced the same short duration. Now, if only my hair on my head would speed up.  Hope it goes well for you. ",

I bought mine at The Vermont Country Store although, last I looked, I couldn't find it on their website. The buff website is www.buff.es but directs you to other sites also.  Once at their site, click on\"store locator'  and then \"online store\".  The www.planetbuff.com has a huge selection. I own the UV buff as stated but there are winter buffs too. It's so comforatble around the house since I still don't have enough hair to keep me warm.  I even wear it at night as the elastic in my night cap is annoying. I can't seem to send the link but if you click on Learn how to wear a buff   and then on biking buff cancer survivors there's a good article.",

ShellyJo ~ Salsa class!  Good for you.  I keep thinking I'll get back to the gym but use my lack of hair for an excuse since I won't try it with the wig.  Guess my buff could be the answer.  If I could wear it to the amusment park, right?

I have white lines across all of them, probably four, one for each tx but they're close together so it's hard to say for sure. The lines start about halfway down.  One more reminder.  Thank you all for sharing.  We never have to feel alone in this.   ",

The elastic on my night cap always began to dig in after a while and had to come off. I slide one end over my head and tuck the other end under the back.  It can be worn many ways but that's easiest for inside the house.  I had a uv buff all summer. It's been washed and worn many times and still maintains its' shape. Besides being comfortable, it's easy to pull off for a hot flash and then slip back on for the chills.  I bought my first buff at the Vermont Country Store but I haven't seen them on their website. Here is a website I found-  www.buffwear.com  I haven't purchased from it.  I did buy from www.planetbuff.com   Very good, quick service. I have seen videos available on buff websites on how to wear a buff  - see link How to Wear a Buff and when I Googled Buff, there's a youtube video too.  Hope this helps until our hair is back.  ",

My brows left me only once, 2 months after chemo and came back in 3-4 weeks but on the thin side. I use pencil to thicken but the space between the brows is a little wider than it used to be.  Sometimes I think it's getting ever so slightly wider.  Hope they don't leave again as often seems to happen. Has anyone lost their brows 8 months out? Has anyone used the Lanigan for thicker lashes?  I can't use eye makeup due to sensitive eyes and would love to have more there. To all those just starting out, it does get better. I can't believe all that's happened in the last year and a half. Blessings to you all.",

I've tried some Loving Care to cover up the few longer hairs around the hairline that peek out from under my medium brown wig.  I trimmed them at first which is probably no great loss  but since that seems to be the only area of much growth, I'd like to keep them.  Angie, you have a great head.  Love it! otter - your information, as usual, prepared me for the eyebrow loss.  It was shortly after the last tx and I used powder and pencil with a stencil for a few weeks.  In the last week or so I realized there was enough growth to go without. A little pencil helps fill in.  Since I can't wear eye makeup, I feel eyebrows are a necessity.   I'm still in awe of all you young Moms with children at home.  I've spent every minute with my grandchildren that I can (and had a ball) but it's not 24/7.  Now that I'm back to work I hear how brave I am a lot.  I know we all do what we have to do whether scared or brave but it's been such a blessing to have the help, advice and support of all of you.

I'm so familiar with them, menopause and then 5 years on Arimidex after the first bc dx.  I had some relief after stopping the Arimidex before my bilat mast in March and only occasional flashes during chemo but now that tx is over they're back. I'm so surprised.  I really dread starting Tamoxifen.  Has anyone been on both?  And what was your experience?  I'm also having a lot of knee pain.  Xrays were  negative but the PT I saw today wants an MRI.  That's a negative until the tissue expanders come out - one more month.  Has anyone experienced joint pain after chemo?  Another question for the onco.  Love to you all. ",

Among other meds, I wore a Scopolomine patch through the procedure and removed it the morning of my chemo. I had no nausea during or after either. I'm not sure why but my reflux has been well controlled also. Now what's the consensus on hair loss?  I'll need a cut and color next week.  My next tx is in 3 weeks. I don't want roots but am afraid the color will make it fall out sooner. The wig is ready when I need it.",

Roberta: The mouth issues have been some of the most irritating.  Food either tastes weird or no flavor at all.  Sweets seem to be somewhat immune for me.  Not the healthiest but the most comforting.  It's day 14 and just today I notice improvement.  My whole mouth has felt like it was recovering from a burn and my palate still feels rough but better. Until next tx.  Sandy",

I've been reading on and off for days but no energy to post.  I'm not sure how much is from the chemo - it's day 18 and I should feel great - or the lack of sleep from the pred. for the eye - still.  Nancy, you're amazing. Don't try to do too much.  Your body has a lot of healing to do.  There is a lot of numbness which helps.  I made full use of the morphine drip in the hospital but only needed pain meds for rest at night once home.  I have expanders so had  that discomfort.  I didn't know there were any other kind of drains.  I was shocked to find out about my jp drains.  I know I was told they would be there but never guessed what they were.  I've posted this info before but if it helps, here it is again.  My local bc support group supplied a goody bag including large men's sleeveless t- shirts.  I pinned the drains to them, underneath. and they held them in one place without getting caught on anything.   I could position them lower, even below the waist depending on what I was wearing.  The other wonder item was a long grosgrain ribbon that I wore around my neck and to which I pinned the drains when I showered.  I hope you enjoyed the pool. ellenoire - you're amazing too.  I don't think I left the house with the drains except to go to the ps. They hurt more than the surgery.   ",

And otter, glad your mammo went pretty well.  Right now I think I'd be willing to trade 2 tissue expanders for a mammogram but too late for that.  4 weeks until exchange.   My most recent bc dx was made via MRI.  My insurance paid and the bc wouldn't have been found so early without it. The MRI was at my request but because of past bc dx, my onco agreed it was justified.  The second dx was in the opposite breast.  There was a span of 5 years between dx.  I don't know if that makes a difference but I am a strong proponent of MRI's and encourage it for bc survivors. I don't intend to scare anyone and am very sorry if I do, but even my onco was surprised and I'd rather be safe than sorry. I did not have dense breasts, don't have the BRAC gene and was on Arimidex for 5 years.",

I did rads 5 years ago and remember the burns and fatigue. Don't try shaving the way I did.  And there was probably no hair to shave.  I didn't bother to look.  Angie ~ glad your Mom is a little better. bcs75 ~ belated best wishes for your birthday. otter ~ saw the hair on another thread.  It's beautiful. I had bilateral exchange surgery Sept. 26.  About a week later, I started to finally feel a little more energetic.  I'm not sure if it was just time or getting rid of those expanders and being able to breath better.  Whatever, it was a relief.  I can honestly say I'm glad I went with expanders.  I didn't have a lot of pain with them but did have a lot of discomfort.  They were so tight.  I'm smaller than I expected but ok with the size.  I'm hoping for a little more projection once I can have the surgical vest off for good.  Have to wear it for 6 weeks. Another step closer to normal.",
