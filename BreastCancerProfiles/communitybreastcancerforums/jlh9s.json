      "Content": "jlh9s wrote: I had a physical yesterday afternoon, and the nurse midwife found a small lump in my right breast. I'm currently pregnant (11 weeks) and have a 18 month old that I just stopped breastfeeding a couple of months ago.  I had assumed that what I had been feeling was the remnant of a plugged duct because I remember feeling it right around the time I had my first brush with a plugged duct/mastitis.  Now I'm feeling like the world's biggest idiot for not having had it checked out immediately by a doctor. Tomorrow morning, I go in for a breast ultrasound.  My mind is swirling with questions: 1.   Is it possible that the lump I'm feeling (which is not at all painful) is some part of a plugged duct or am I kidding myself? 2.  If the BIRAD is 1-3, I understand that there is no biopsy.  But can that tell for sure?  In other words, can an ultrasound ever tell 100% that it's a cyst or benign?  Why wouldn't I get a needle or other biospy just to be on the safe side?  I guess my fear is that they say it's a cyst - which, don't get me wrong, I am praying they do - but that they're wrong and I find out many months later. 3.  Any thoughts on preference of type of biopsy?  I'm guessing if it's BIRAD 4 or 5, I'm just going with whatever they recommend.  But if it's a 3, for example, and I wanted to know for sure, would you request a biospy, and if so, what kind? 4.  How long did you have to wait after an ultrasound to talk to the radiologist/see the report?  How about a biopsy? 5.  If it does turn out to be positive, is there anything you wish you'd known at the beginning or done at the beginning knowing what you know now? Thanks so much for putting up with my ramblings and any and all responses!  I'm just scared to death of going through this while pregnant and suddenly facing the thought of possibly not being there for my 18 month old.  Log in to post a reply",

Anyway, I went in for the ultrasound and the ultrasound tech seemed to be having a hard time finding it.  I had her feel the lump (it's about the size of a pea), and she took images of the area and told me that \"she got it,\" but her expression was a little odd.  She came back after consulting with the radiologist and told me they couldn't see anything on the ultrasound and therefore, I should just check back with my midwife on what to do.  I told her that a midwife was not going to be able to advise me on this, and that I wanted to talk to the radiologist. So I did talk to the radiologist, and she said that in her opinion, it was most likely fibrocystic fatty tissue.  She said that they could not do a biopsy because they can't find it on an ultrasound and if they can't find it, they can't biopsy it.  I said, \"Well, if you can't see it, how can you be sure what it is?\"  And she did verify and feel the lump.  She said based on her experience at reading films, she would feel comfortable doing nothing further.  But she said, \"Because you're pregnant, anxiety can be an issue, and for anxiety reasons, we have done referrals to breast surgeons before for a biopsy.\"  I got the very strong sense that had I not been pregnant, she wouldn't have recommended a referral at all, but she thought I would worry so much that I could jeopardize the pregnancy.  I'm not sure that's the case, but I was glad for the referral since I wanted something a little more definitive.   So I have an appointment with one breast surgeon next Tuesday and another next Wednesday.  I put in a call to another ultrasound imaging place to see if I can have another ultrasound done in the meantime to see if they can spot it.  I don't know enough about ultrasounds to know if this is possible, but it occurs to me that someone who's not as skilled at ultrasounding might get images of the particular area but not this particular lump, since it is so small.  The ultrasound tech spent about five minutes total and was fairly young - not to say she wasn't good, but I wondered if a more persistent technician might have been able to \"find\" it on the ultrasound. This may sound completely paranoid, but if they can't get an image of it, my inclination is to get a biospy even if that means surgical removal.  I'm the mother of an 18 month old and the family's only breadwinner (self employed) with another baby on the way.  I'm relieved that the radiologist thought it was nothing, but I'd just like to be as sure as I can, because if that turned out to be wrong and I found out later, that could really jeopardize the three people in my family depending on me.  What do you all think? They are going to send the report to me directly and as soon as I get it, I will post it.   ",
