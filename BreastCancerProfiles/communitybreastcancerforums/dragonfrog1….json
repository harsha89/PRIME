My tumor is on the top of the breast at 12:00 oclock and it can be felt easily although I did not know it was a lump. I noticed a change in the shape of that breast in August but have been dieting and attributed the change to weight loss and age. I am glad your arm is feeling better that is a concern of mine because I take care of a lovely 94 year old lady and I am worried about her being without help while I am healing. I have begged her to take on someone else but she is being stubborn. I love your Yorkie! What school did yoiur husband go to? I was a Sacred Heart girl but finished high school at Tolman on exchange street.",

I will have 6 weeks of radiation but no chemo is planned unless the cancer has spread. The tumor is hormone receptive so I will take a hormone blocking med for 5 years. That is the plan so far. Does the injection in the breast before surgery involve much pain? I am just wondering what to expect. I handle pain well as a rule. Thanks, Mary",

My surgeon did mention that the underarm area can be more uncomfortable than the breast incision. I hope your discomfort passes quickly. I don't know about that SNB injection. I had a core needle biopsy and the surgeon used lidocaine but I still felt it when she went in and got the tissue from the tumor. I guess I'll find out on Monday. I let you know. Take good care of yourself! Mary:)",

I feel better prepared to deal with the injection now and the possibility of a drain. I am going to get myself some kind of little pillow too. We have 2 cats and they do like to climb on me in bed. I feel pretty confident about the care I am and will receive. I am having surgery at Women & Infant's Breast Care Center in Providence RI. They have a tumor board of different specialists and they discuss your case and together design a plan of treatment to suit your individual case. My surgeon is a lovely young women and is down to earth besides she brings her little dog to work with her on Saturday and anyone who loves animals is good in my book!",

First had a chat with the Rn about my meds and other medical conditions. she took my weight and blood pressure, then had me change into a gown. The doctor came in and we talked and she examined me and made marks on my skin where the tatoos would be. Then I went into the room where the catscan is done and the tech positioned me on the table. The catscan result was not quite right so we had to do it again with a wedge behind my back to lift me up some. That was perfect. The tatoos were done and that was it. The worst part was laying on the hard table in one position for 20 minutes and it was so cold in there! Not that bad!",
