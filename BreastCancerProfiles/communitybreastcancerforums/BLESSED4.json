She has a rediation simulation today starting on Tuesday. She was originally set for a PET on Tuesday but landed in the hospital on Monday. She will have a pet on this coming Tuesday to check everything else. Our hopes are it has stayed in the bones and kidney only so who knows maybe treatment? We need to first get through this. It was pretty bad but she is doing good. Thanks for prayers. Luann, PM my moms box so u can call me. I can keep you updated and then you can update everyone.

Hopefully I get the stint in the kidney asap. I guess you have to take the good with the bad. I had went to the hospital for pain and I found out about the kidney. Well it could be worse. I got on stronger Lexapro seems to be working. I think I got overwhelmed with the holidays. I think I would have felt better sooner had I came here to vent. I didn't want to mess up the PC with tears. My daughter turned sixteen today and I am having a sweet sixteen party on Sunday. I am blessed to see my daughter become a young lady.
