However, there was one very interesting thing I learnt today - the tumor is of grade 3 because it is 2.3 cm - I dont know what stage I am cateogrized - with all the tension I misunderstood between the grade and stage. But I love being here with all of you and look forward every day for your emails and support. Thanks a lot - and especially thanks to \"let it be for being the champion in our fight against BC.

It is worth calling them to find out - the injection costs 2600/- each - for 6 session that is 15000/- Not all insurance covers the full medication costs and here is where Victory Program comes in - and assists those in need. They have their own website. Feroza Log in to post a reply",
