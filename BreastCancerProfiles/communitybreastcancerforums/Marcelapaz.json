Soon after I was told that they found a Cyst and a solid mass, so the recommendation was to follow up with and ultrasound. The ultrasound established that the cyst was approximately 2.0 cm large and the solid mass about 0.9 cm and the specific location of both, so a FNA (Fine needle aspiration) was recommended.  The preceding was schedule and I went to the appointment thinking that this was the last visit and the result was going to be just fine. The FNA was ok, short, no big pain at the moment, and I was able to see how they aspirated the cyst completely, it was gone. But the second one, on the solid mass the doctor had to try more times, it seems that the needle wasn't taking the needed sample, but after a couple of tries the proceeding was complete. I went home with some recommendations, like take Advil or Tylenol for pain and some cold pads over the affected areas and no heavy activity with my right side for a few days. Three days passed and I started to feel very disturbing pain, it was sharp, and intense, not all the time, but very often, it was inside my right breast, like in the middle, behind the nipple, the only comfort that I could found was pressing my breast with my hands.  Then I had to add to the pain, the anxiety of being waiting for more than two weeks on the Pathology result.  The report read that the result for the cyst was benign and the result for the mass was a suggestive Intra-mammary Lymph Node and the recommendation was to see a Breast Surgeon. So I continued into this process, so I got an appointment with the surgeon like a month after. Once with the doctor, she told me that everything was fine and I had to do a follow up within 6 month, so again the ultrasound and for what I see in the prescription she mentioned FNA too. She said that intra-mammary lymph nodes are common, not rear and they would not bring any problem .  I did my search, very cautiously, not trying to grow panic at all, but seems like anywhere, where  I type intramammary lymph node , the result were talking about breast cancer, either it becomes cancer or was related to cancer. I was told for a close person who had same diagnosis 2 years ago, and she was told to wait 6 month to check again, but it was not treat for her, and unfortunately she had some symptoms before the time that made her go back to see the doctor, and this time the little 0.9cm lymph node was almost 3.0 cm, it was cancer and she went under surgery, a mastectomy , so of course I'm a little concern when the doctor told me to wait and not to worry. Should I seek a second opinion ??? is this intramammary lymph node suppose to be there?  Why after a month I still have pain? Now I feel pulling pain into my right arm and my arm pit , it is very uncomfortable pain I even feel it into my back. Please advice.  Thanks Marcelapaz Log in to post a reply",
