My onc stopped my herceptin last week- it has been exactly 2 yrs on it now and he thinks it is time to finish. As I always say, it is hard to know what to do with the might be/might not be liver mets scenario. I will pop back in again soon and write properly but wanted to let you all know I am thinking of you xoxoxo",

I think it was a warning from my body that I am not as recovered as I thought! New Zealand was lovely, I have put some photos up on my Facebook page for those of you that are members. It wasn't as relaxing as I had hoped- entertaining to active boys 24/7 for 2 weeks non stop is exhausting! I was rather glad to get them home and back into school. We still have Toben in with the child psych. Somedays I think it helps others not so much. I toy with the idea of trying him on medication but have managed to resist so far. Liezel how are you going with your son? Riley turns 3 today! I can't believe it. It must mean we are coming up to 3 yrs since dx. Wow. I have to get these monkeys to school love you all xoxoxo",

The kids had such a great time with him home and were pretty well behaved! Their behaviour goes out the window when he leaves so I am back to hourly battles with the terrors! I was just thinking this morning about all of us coming up to our 3yr anniversary- how exciting! I am slowly starting to think more into the future now. I think because off all my \"liver mets/not mets\" drama it has taken me longer to trust I am \"well\" and make plans for the future. I have to go and get these boys organised for school/kindy but wanted to jump on and let you know I think of  you all heaps!! xoxooxoo ",

Firstly let me say how much I loved catching up on the previous posts and how gorgeous the photos are of Sandra and Susan's catch up! I would love to come to NY as I have an aussie friend living there now and have made a few bc friends as well. Definately on my to do list! I think a few of you may have updated your pics for your profile? And how lovely they are! Glad to see us looking so good :D Things have been okay here with us. Last week I had my 5th (!!!) boob operation as after the last one some internal stitches popped giving a very awkward shape so that had to be fixed as well as some nasty scars that needed revising. Just a minor op in the scheme of things and all went well. My onc has referred me onto a gyn-onc for discussions about what to do now I have finished zoladex. I suppose I am officially finished treatment?? My 2yrs of herceptin was up at Christmas and my last zoladex was a week ago. However the gyn-onc and my onc both feel I should have at least an ooph if not full hyst. I was very upset at that as I am still mourning my oldself and was really looking forward to her returning once zoladex was done. I feel so cranky, moody, tired, etc with the menopause symptoms however this new onc said \"rather than fighting the beast you need to learn to stroke it\" so he is aiming to do a more multidisciplinary approach to managing my symptoms rather than me constantly fighting to rid of them completely. I am going to bite the bullet and go ahead and book either the ooph or hyst next Monday so I will let you know when THAT surgery date is over. I am hoping then to be rid of the port as well! My final legacy! :D Toben as you may remember was having some serious issues since my illness with anxiety/ADD symptoms and Post traumatic stress. He has finally been seeing someone very experienced with this sort of thing on a weekly basis which seems to be helping. He has his ups and downs but we are learning to manage them slightly better at least. Liezel I remember your son was having some similar issues, how is he? Scott has taken up his new posting with the army which is 15hrs away. He works for 10weeks away from home then is back for a week. Not the most idea situation however it is much needed for both of our sanities I feel. Long story really but much of the same ups and downs. Tina I would love to have a copy of your restricted calorie food plan (notice me not using the word \"diet\"!) please. Do you have my email address? it is my user name at hotmail dot com. I have put on alot of weight (again with zoladex and menopause) and am an eating machine! I need to plan better however as I have never needed to watch what I eat don't know where to start. Once my operations are out of the way I hope to get into the gym I have to dash as I am expecting a client any minute (I am just doing beauty stuff from home for some pocket money at the moment)! love to you all and please know that even if I don't post I often lurk and think of you always xooxoxoxo",

I have been very busy reading ALL the last lot of pages since the last time I looked in on everyone and I kept wanting to skip to the last page but felt I would miss too much if I did! Anyway I am so pleased to find you all on here still posting messages.  Gosh- where to start with me?? The kids are great albeit a huge handful at times! Scott was posted in the army out of town to a place about 15 hrs away. Rather than go with him I decided to stay here. We have been separated for a few months now but are hopeful things will work out. I feel as though the cancer stuff did not strengthen us at all, in fact it drew out our weaknesses and now is the time to rebuild. We are positive and getting along fabulously so small steps! Toben is still seeing his child psychiatrist for behavioural issues. Liezel- there is so much fantastic information out there regarding high functioning AD/Aspergers I hope you are making your way though the maze. Toben has kind of slipped through alot of cracks regarding an official diagnosis so it is one step forward 3 steps back a lot of the time. We are getting there though.  I am seeing my onc 3 monthly still and scans about every 6. I am due soon for another and I still get insanely anxious about them and my liver \"lesions\". I am feeling great and am hopeful the next scan will reveal no change.   After the hyst/ooph last May I was prescribed femara. Anyone else taking it? I started it and within days developed terrible neutropenia. I was convinced I had cancer again it was awful. Anyway, it was apparently a crazy coincidence- I had a nasty virus! Since then I have been a little scared of the femara. Yes, I am more scared of the cancer and want to do everything to make sure it doesn't come back but this silly little pill worries me! Needless to say I haven't started on it despite it being months and really really need to. I will though!  I hope everyone is doing great. I was so happy to jump on here tonight and see my fantastic and all powerful September Sisters!! I am on facebook alot so if you don't 'see' me on here that is where I will be! xoxooxox ",

It has so long since I have been here- I think I went through a really big phase of trying to \"forget\" however it really was a like being chased. Eventually you can't run anymore and the beast eventually catches up with you in one way or another. Nicole- I am MAD to hear of your new dx but it has to be said I LOVE hearing your fighting attiitude and the fact you are tolerating the new chemo so well. Fantastic news!! Can you PM me your address if you don't mind? Well pretty much to the DAY of my 4yr original dx I was in having a fine needle biopsy on 2 x lumps that have come back as cancer. At this stage they are unsure if it is a local reoccurance or a new primary as the preliminary pathology came back as a new primary. Now they are retesting everything for final results. Originally I was weakly ER+ PR- Her2+++ now it appears I am Strongly ER+ (90%) Strongly PR+ (90%) and Her2+++. I was dx'd purely by chance as it was a routine ultrasound and mammo that picked it up and couldn't be felt at all. I had my lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy last Monday and have recovered much better this time around. No drain and less pain thankfully. However they didn't clear margins all the way around and I am off for another surgery this Friday. I meet with my onc on Wednesday and I  am pretty scared that he will push for more chemo. I was just so seriously ill last time it terrifies me beyond belief to go there again. Making it extra difficult this time is the fact that Scott and I are separated. As you may remember he was posted with the army 2yrs ago to a town 15hrs away and things were already terrible and it took a slide from there. So this time it is just me and the boys! They are both older  obviously (nearly 7 and just turned 4) however with age comes more fears for them but I am pretty open with them and they seem happy with the answers I have given them. Anyway that is me for now. I am running late to get Toben to school even though I was just going to pop in here and say hi!! I never could resist a chat!! Thanks for caring my sisters, it does feel like coming home to you all. xxxxxxxxxxx",

Nicole what awesome news about your tm's. Keep knocking them out of the ball park girl. I had my margin revision surgery on Monday and thankfully they have came back with clear margins this time. Unfotunately though the original advice I was given by another oncologist when mine was away, was incorrect and I actuallly DO have to have chemo. I will be having weekly taxol for 12 weeks followed by 12 months herceptin then rads. In 2 days (Friday) I will be back in surgery for my port to go back in. I am pretty down about it all as it has come as a shock after speaking to the other onc who reassured me we would't be going down this path. Anyway, that is where I am at at the moment!

I am so pleased he is now essentially cured Liezel and my heart was in my mouth when I read your news of his initial problems. Don't beat yourself up though honey.   Susan my heart and prayers go out to you. I totally understand your need for privacy on facebook so understand why I didn't know of this earlier and gives me a massive push to check in here more often. Please know I DO think of you all often, especially this year, 5 years on.  To this day my doctors don't really know what it is/was in my liver. Mets? benign masses? I do know initially I was given 2 years and I am still hear 4 years later. Yes I have had my most recent reoccurance but I am here. After my most recent chemo I was due to start radiation and panicked. After much deliberation I decided on a bilateral mastectomy with an immediate DIEP reconstruction. It was a long, painful process. (13.5hrs on the operating table, 4 x blood transfusions, 3 days in ICU and a week in hospital). That was in April around Easter. August I had implants and nipple reconstruction. I am feeling healthy and all that remains to be done is the nipple colour tattooing. I will do that when I get around to it! Unfortunately I am battling a lot of depression at the moment which makes it difficult. I am seeing an amazing psychiatrist who is helping a lot and I am on a couple of different medications for a long while now which have been helping but we are adjusting at the moment. I am not sure what triggered it- possibly a type of PTSD post cancer but who really knows with this kind of thing? I am predisposed to it anyway. Toben was diagnosed with ADHD and Oppositional Defiance Disorder earlier this year which is challenging! I need to be honest and you ladies are the only ones who I can say this to. I admit I have been living somewhat recklessly these past few months since the operations have ended by avoiding doctors and hospitals as well as some treatments. I am not sure why I am doing this and now I am scared. I am due to have scans and I am TERRIFIED this time. So that is me! Other than this I am doing okay. The kids are growing into beautiful albeit trying little people and Riley has been enjoying his first year at school. Love to you all and I will check back again soon xxxxxx ",

Well I have some news....I went to my herceptin and onc appt on friday and he told me that \"we don't think its mets (the liver spots) so we are stopping herceptin at your next visit\". I am in 2 minds about this and I am hoping you ladies can shed some light on it all!! As you know I have been on the rollercoaster from hell with all of this liver stuff. The initial liver dx was mets and I was treated for it which literally nearly killed me, put my family through living hell (my children are still suffering from it- my eldest just had an appt with child and youth mental health) and just about destroyed all of us. Then they said it wasn't. Then we don't know so we'll treat as it was just incase. Now the same onc and same radiologist are saying it never was mets!!! How do I believe them? How do I know? No new scans have been done since 6 months ago so its not as though new info has come to hand its like they have just \"decided\". People have said to me that it is great news (which it is) though the cloud of uncertainty this \"diagnosis\" has come under is just a bit much for me. How can they just decide this week its not mets after so much uncertainty when they were so SURE it was mets originally? I am really angry. Every day is filled with anger. And this was even before Friday's newest diagnosis. I am white hot with rage most days. Am already on Lexapro which has been upped from 10mg to 15 to now 20mg. I am cancerfree which has been my dream, my friends and family are moving on from it all but I am just SO MAD. I can barely function- I scream incessantly at the kids, pick fights with just about everyone, have no patience or tolerance. My relationship with the kids is average at best (you may remember they are now 2 and almost 5- new born and 2.5yrs at dx) because of how mad I am. My partner and I are just holding on. Suggestions?? I think i will post this on the moving beyond as well- I need all the imput I can get!! Thanks xoxoxo",

The first week was very rough- a bit of pain and I ended up staying in for 3 nights which was a good thing in the end I suppose. Scott was able to come home for 2 weeks thank God so I am just getting through this week alone with the kids before heading off to New Zealand for a 2 week holiday. I can't wait! I am sure the flight over will be difficult flying alone with the kids but once we are there i can relax!! By the time I get home I should be nicely recovered. I guess the hardest thing for me is the fact that the doctors STILL won't commit to saying if I had liver mets or not. That is a HUGE thing for me mentally that I struggle with a lot. I received a copy of my report from my surgery and my previous history had \"breast cancer with liver metastates\" which I didnot want to read! I am seeing a counsellor to help me through this and other cancer related issues which I suppose is helping. I am so happy to see everyone doing so well on here! I know we have our struggles and worries but as a whole I am pretty darn proud of how we are all getting on. Love Leanne",

She is awaiting a stem cell transplant but is battling infection and problem after problem. The lumbar puncture went wrong and the spinal fluid leaked causing lots of pain. She has VERY little to no help with her children and is in hospital for weeks/months at a time somewhere in New York. I know how much your thoughts and prayers helped me and I am wondering if you would mind thinking of her and sending healing thoughts to her and of course her children. It is so so sad. I can not imagine going through chemo to save my life only to have it endanger it so severely at the other end. She really is not well ladies. Thanks so much! xoxoxoxo",

While I think of you all often I do not spend much time on here as it feels I am juggling the kids, chemo etc non stop! I am so upset/cranky/devastated about the latest developments in your health �Nicole and am desperately hoping the Xeloda does wonders for you. There are a few women who I had previously met on ysc.org who had great results on it and I am praying it is the same for you. I am so pleased to hear your employer is being so fantastic. You hear so many negative stories about employers dealing with ill employees I am rapt they are doing everything they can to help. Please remember if you ever want to call or email me feel free. Even if it is rant and rave, cry or talk about the weather! Liezel So sorry about the loss of your baby and am glad you are working through it the best you can. Did you say if you were trying again? Sorry for the loss of your friend. Cancer just takes way too many and too much. Tina any more news on your daughter? Here's to hoping it is just a pesky rash! :-) But seriously, please keep us posted.   Susan and Sandra- A massive hello from down under and I hope your Christmas preparations are ticking along nicely! I will be having my 4th chemo on Friday. I feel dreadful that night and all day Saturday/Sunday and tend to start returning to normal Monday with my best being Wednesday and Thursday. It is totally exhausting not having anyone to help with the kids and I feel as though I have a heap of balls in the air that I am juggling and if I drop just one... But all in all I am feeling okay. I had all my hair cut off today which was weird. It was getting SO long :-( I will be sure to try and check in more regularly Love to you all xxx ",

I have been having intense migraines for a while now and when i look back I have been experiencing many symptoms however they could all be put down to being tired, stressed or just life! So I haven't worried. Last week I had a bit of an episode where I had a migraine but became disorientated, confused, had trouble with speech, reading and recognising numbers. Very scary. My dr was actually looking for a brain bleed/stroke however a met was found instead. Obviously I am still amazingly stunned and shocked. I had a full body CT yesterday that showed I have no other mets anywhere else which is a relief!! However I have to gather myself and fight again- this time the brain. So overwhelming!! I hope to hear tomorrow or Monday about when surgery will be scheduled but all indications are pointing to within the next week or 2. I will continue with herceptin since it seems to be doing a good job with protecting the rest of my body and whole brain radiation will commence once surgery is done. Beyond that I do not know. it is all so scary and of course, I am again doing this on my own with the kids so I am sure it will really test me out!! I haven't told the children yet, I want to have all my facts and treatment dates before I do so I can be as factual as possible. Toben already suspects something as he asked me last night if I am sick... I passed it off as having a bit of a cough (I had hayfever!) but will be lucky to keep up the bravado over the next few days I think. I can't cry because I am scared I won't stop so I am just going forward as much as I can.  I am on facebook almost daily so that is probably the best place to catch me or my direct email is leannemyles1 @ gmail . com  Love to you all xxxx ",

I can't believe how hard this has hit me! I am sitting here bawling my eyes out. Maybe because she was one of the first to send me cards when I was so ill a while ago? Maybe because this could be any one of us? I don't know. I just know that it is possibly one of the reasons I try so hard not to be on my computer much anymore- maybe if I don't look people won't die??? You know when you play peek a boo with a baby and they REALLY think if they put their hands up to their face and can't see you you disappear?? That is how I feel with the boards I think- maybe if I don't look people won't get diagnosed, won't get mets and won't die. But just like a baby realising eventually it is all an illusion, I learn that staying of the boards doesn't make the shitty disease go away. Sorry to pop in with such negativity I am just so sad. love u all xoxoox",

Peg, I also wonder what else can we do other than get caught up in this pink, money making machine and hope the money is going to the right places. A couple of weeks ago I was asked by the National Breast Cancer Foundation to speak at a dinner for 200 people. The speech went well however I felt as though I was telling the story of someone else- not me. An older lady came up to me, and told me she has just finished her chemo earlier this year but was still going through some other treatments. She was clearly wanting to talk. But I just couldn't do it. I just couldn't talk with her and tell her she would get through it. There I was, meant to be some kind of spokesperson and \"inspiration\" but I couldn't reach out to another woman when she needed it. I just shut down and went blank. I feel dreadful now. I wasn't rude but I was short and I know I wasn't comforting. Has this happened to anyone else? I also hate that I have not come out of all of this as a better person. While I am thankful I am alive I do not wake up everyday in a good mood, pleased the sun is shining and the sky is blue. I snap and yell at my boys, pick fights with my partner and am lazy. I need to exercise and eat better to look after myself (damn that zoladex weight) but I don't. I have no motivation to do so. I am not overly depressed (upped my lexapro a few weeks ago as I needed the extra but feel better now). I have a permanent bad mood either hanging over me or just off to the side. I'm easily annoyed and have absolutely no patience or tolerance. I can still have fun but it isn't as often as what one would expect after going through all the crap. Does this make sense? It is really weird. On another note, the kids are fine. My eldest turns 5 on the 12 November and I am attempting to throw him a pretty big party. Lots of kids and games sausages on the barbeque! Should be fun. He is still acting up a fair bit and we have yet another specialist appointment Thursday. Hopefully this one can help. Scott is being moved out of Brisbane to another town about 15hrs south west. We have decided that for the time being the children and I will stay here. I am a bit scared but I suppose I have my treatment, doc's and friends here. Toben starts school and we were able to get him into a good local one but I am still worried about being alone. The position is for 2yrs but I am hoping we might be able to join him after 3-6 months. Basically, with all the relationship troubles we have had/been having he thinks the separation will be good for us. I don't agree and would rather move but he would like to wait. Hopefully the distance will make the heart grow fonder. Its hard. Love to you all and I will be thinking of you Tina in a couple of days time on your 2nd last herceptin!!! xoxooxox",

While I think of you all often I do not spend much time on here as it feels I am juggling the kids, chemo etc non stop! I am so upset/cranky/devastated about the latest developments in your health �Nicole and am desperately hoping the Xeloda does wonders for you. There are a few women who I had previously met on ysc.org who had great results on it and I am praying it is the same for you. I am so pleased to hear your employer is being so fantastic. You hear so many negative stories about employers dealing with ill employees I am rapt they are doing everything they can to help. Please remember if you ever want to call or email me feel free. Even if it is rant and rave, cry or talk about the weather! Liezel So sorry about the loss of your baby and am glad you are working through it the best you can. Did you say if you were trying again? Sorry for the loss of your friend. Cancer just takes way too many and too much. Tina any more news on your daughter? Here's to hoping it is just a pesky rash! :-) But seriously, please keep us posted.   Susan and Sandra- A massive hello from down under and I hope your Christmas preparations are ticking along nicely! I will be having my 4th chemo on Friday. I feel dreadful that night and all day Saturday/Sunday and tend to start returning to normal Monday with my best being Wednesday and Thursday. It is totally exhausting not having anyone to help with the kids and I feel as though I have a heap of balls in the air that I am juggling and if I drop just one... But all in all I am feeling okay. I had all my hair cut off today which was weird. It was getting SO long :-( I will be sure to try and check in more regularly Love to you all xxx ",
