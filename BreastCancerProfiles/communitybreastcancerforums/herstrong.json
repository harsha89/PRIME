I want to live, so I have taken every treatment that has been recommended. I'm not going to lie, but loosing my hair has been by far the most difficult aspect of having breast cancer for me. And that's why I read this thread even after loosing my hair a year ago. These gals are my source of strength. It's not vain - we associate our femininity with girlish hair and breasts, so the thought of loosing those things are devestating. But I want to live, so I took the treatments. If I ever need to go through chemo again, I would definitely try harder to save my hair with cold caps. There is a great thread on here and many women have had different levels of success with them. This is your time to pull up your big girl panties and fight. And we'll be here for you.",

Amazingly, not only did he stick around but he made his commitment stronger to me. Even bought me a beautiful ring (but it's NOT an engagement ring, lol!) He's not the type to dote on me or tell me how how he can't get along without me, but when my BMX went wrong a couple weeks ago, there he was in the hospital (which he hates) with tears in his eyes fighting alongside with me. He told me he loved me more in two days than the last year! BC separates the men from the boys and I'm so sorry you had to go five years before finding out which one he was. I never dreamed that my man had it in him. I know you're probably sick of hearing that you'll find someone more worthy of your love. I know it's easier said than done, but with the BC up front, at least you'll be able to separate the men from the boys quicker. ",

Chemo and especially Herceptin are hard on the heart, so anything you can do to exercise is a plus. MUGA scores tend to decrease with these drugs but mine was increasing with little to moderate exercise. So even if you're on chemo and weak, every little bit helps :)",

I have been finally able to use my straightener for about a month, which made my hair look longer. But my hair is so obnoxiously thick that now I'm looking like one of the Bay City Rollers. My bf said I need to start wearing plaid. Smart ass. Anyways, I've only had one trim of less than a quarter inch, as I just can't bear to lose any hair. But now I'm wondering if I should be at least brave enough to have it thinned out a bit to make it more manageable. Have any of you done this? If so, how was the outcome?",

I just went from totally hating the way I  look to just hating the way I look at the 9 month mark. I guess I should try to cheer myself up with the fact that I'll have so many different looks as my hair grows back down to where my boobs used to be. I was devastated to lose the quarter inch I did in October. What do you think about thinning it a bit? Or maybe when it gets a little longer it might lay down a little better. And gals, I'm so sorry about complaining about thick hair when you are struggling with thin hair. That must be very difficult. Hugs.",

I had the back of my hairline trimmed a wee bit today to clean it up a bit. My blonde neck hairs were making me look a little unkempt. My cousin (also my hairdresser) told me that it's something about the blood supply that makes your hair grow faster in the back, which is about 1 1/2 inches now.

I was on Plavix and they thought I was having a heart attack in recovery because my BP was so low. Turned out they weren't using the drains right and figured out I wasn't having a heart attack but was hemorrhaging. I went back to surgery to stop the bleeding but before going, the anestegiologist said I had \"a high probability of dying in surgery.\" Afterward, he said the fact that I work out saved my life. Honestly, I can't get back soon enough.",
