I was so stressed out and depressed  the weekend before that I stayed in bed all weekend. My mapping was fine, but I have to tell you that I am so tired of being the only one half naked in the room. This time there were 7 other people in the room. I mean seriously. They were physicists, nurses, and RO, but I'm the only one half naked.  I start my first rad treatment on 1/26. I will have 33 total...28 regular and 5 boosts. I'm concerned about burning and fatigue.  As it is, I had a lumpectomy on 12/27 with lymph node dissection.  The lumpectomy incision is fine although I get an occasional sharp  pain through my breast which takes my breath away. I was told it's healing and it's most likely a nerve twinge. However, the lymph node incision is healing but in an area that is constantly irritated by movement and clothing. So I've already been feeling uncomfortable...so side effects from radiation scare the heck out of me. I also have rheumatoid arthritis and get an occasional flair which is very painful. I think I've been handling this whole breast cancer bit well because I'm always willing to share about it so it's not the elephant in the room and you'll find me making some kind of joke about it so I can laugh, but I'm tired of this journey already and I'ts only just beginning. I think the surgery was the easiest part of this journey. I appreciate you all being here because people who haven't experienced this, don't understand. Just because I'm not complaining doesn't mean that I'm okay; or maybe I am complaining and I just need to be listened to, not fixed;  or just because you don't see me in pain doesn't mean that I'm not. I'm sorry for the ramble. I'm just trying to put one foot in front of the other, but sometimes my head has a temper tantrum  along  the way. Thanks for listening.",

I'll see the doctor on Monday or Tuesday. I've read through the previous posts and I can relate with the fatigue. My feet felt like lead today.  I don't totally associate the fatigue with the #7 treatment, but I've also had a number of arthritis flairs in the past two weeks, I'm fighting off a cold or allergies, and it was report card week. I'm exhausted.",

I'm not looking forward to the SE with the tamoxifen. I'm 48. I want to reduce the possibilities of a recurrence  as much as possible because if it comes back I lose my breast. It's all very stressful. #12 today. 21 to go. I'm very diligent about using the lotion 3x a day all over the irradiated area, but my side got so itchy today I thought I was going to scratch my skin off. It's a spot I didn't even think would be affected.  I'm trying to be proactive but sometimes I'm just frustrated.",

I met with my radiation oncologist last Wednesday and I go for mapping on Monday. I've been stressed out about this whole radiation process. At this point, it seems that the surgery was the easy part. I  also have rheumatoid arthritis, so I already suffer from fatigue and the medication I take for that makes my skin sensitive. I don't know what to expect from radiation. I can't imagine doing that 5 days a week for the next 6 weeks. I guess I need to be willing to do  anything that will protect me from the cancer...but I'm stressed out about the next part of the treatment process. Traci",
