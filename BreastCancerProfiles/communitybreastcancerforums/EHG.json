As noted before, I had a very serious allergic reaction to the Taxotere which started as soon as it hit my veins and caused my physician to stop my treatment and seek other alternatives. The problem was that all of the physicians that I've consulted with and got a 2nd opinion from (I've spoke with 5 of them), were not decisive and didn't speak from experience but rather named several alternatives based on their hypothesis. Moreover, all of them were against continuing the current treatment as they feared that I might undergo an anaphylactic shock and die as a result of the Taxoter! All of that changed when I went to \"The City of Hope\" in LA for another 2nd opinion, and the oncologist I've met was very confident that the reaction is actually not an allergic reaction but more of a mascular spasm that is simply treated by adding pain medication (Percocet) that relaxes the muscles - she reassured me that there is no risk to my life or any other long term damage and told me that they have seen dozens of cases like this in their center.  Today, I've received my 2nd treatment (#5 overall) with the pain medications and both of the treatments were uneventful - no allergic reaction, no pain - I just breezed through them (although I was very tired and delusional from the pain and relaxation medication).  That it in a nut shell - I really hope that someone who will have the same reaction can use this info in order to shorten the anxiety and uncertainty period that I've just experienced.  All the best to all of you and thank you for your comments and replies  ",

Yesterday, they've decided to stop the treatment and I didn't get any Taxotere. My onc said she never had a case like this and is starting to seek advise from other colleagues in order to decide what to do next. I started searching the web for similar cases and the only ones I've found so far were in this thread. I understand that you've switched to Abraxane, but my onc said that I could have the same reaction to it as I had to the Taxotere. Do you have any additional info on why did your onc decide to move you to Abraxane and whether he thought you might get a similar reaction. I would be grateful if you can point me to any additional info that might guide me. Thank you so much, EHG",
