    "Content": "Rmgsar wrote: I waxed my head after my third chemo because the black dots after shaving looked not so nice. Now I'm concerned at the end of my chemo (July 11 2013) that my hair may not grow back because what if chemo compromised /weakened the hair follicles and now waxing pulled them out and my hair will NEVER GROW BACK!!! Very concerned has anyone else waxed their head after onset of chemo and did your hair grow back? Log in to post a reply",
