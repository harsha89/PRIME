I am currently on leave trying to decide if I can work at all or should let the job go. In the midst of this cancer commotion, I am finishing my lastcourse for my masters program, and prepaaring to move this summer.  I am feeling overwhelmed and cry at random thoughts and moments.   My next steps are scans and echo in prep for chemo. Am so hoping for clear scans. Briefly met my MO and felt he was calm and confident.  ",

I have a PET CT next week but will not get the results for a week after that.  My care is at a major military hospital caring for wounded warriors. Yessterday moments after leaving the breast cancer clinic we were in the midst of soldiers recovering from devastating disfiguring injuries. It was quite a perspective check. Cancer and this process still sucks, but there are others suffering in ways I cannot comprehend. ",

I haven't started chemo yet but we think the move will be between chemo and rad.  We are trying to think of Hawaii as the reward for going through this process.  Oceana- thank you for your kind words. The military life has been mostly a blessing. I have met some amazing people and truly courageous soliders especially those recovering from injuries where I get my treatment. ",
