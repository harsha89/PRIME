I was told to increase my Vitamin D to 2000 mg since it is cancer-fighting, and taking vitamin D could reduce side effects from Arimidex.  Besides calcium, Vit D is the only supplement that was specifically recommended.  I was told to avoid extra doses of vitamin C during chemo and radiation.   Laura",

Gutsy- I'm glad you mentioned slippers.  That's a great idea I hadn't thought of.  My BMX and DIEP reconstruction is Jan 12th, next Wednesday. Laura ",
