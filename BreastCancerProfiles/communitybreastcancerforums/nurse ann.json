P.S.  I've just gathered almost 5 years of records together for MD Anderson.  I had a real interesting time reading all these physician notes (three Onc's) and all these tests.  For instance, the first Onc is making snide remarks in the report about me going to my Primary Care Physician for a diagnosis.  She actually found my Mets - nuts to the original Onc!",

One of the weirdest was an issue with my eyes.  I live in a dry climate and my eyes were so dry that the corneas of both eyes pitted and my vision blurred.  I have a very good eye doctor with a lot of chemo patients.  He sent me home with a variety of samples and I selected an ointment that did the trick.  This is what I mean about staying on top of side effects.  I have to also say that I have several doctors that I rely on - rely as little as possible on Oncologists.  It's my \"other\" doctors that keep me going, in my opinion.  I'm off to see my urologist tomorrow - he is always glad to see me and know that I'm still alive. Good luck to your mother on this drug.  I think its a good one.",

Again I say, this is just another way to make money off of BC patients.  I am getting as turned off by \"awareness\" as I am by the term \"survivor\".  If you really want to scare people into being aware, tell them how many Stage 0, Stage 1 - 3 eventually end up Stage 4. \"Oncology World\" does not want to do this because it would scare the crap out of Stage 0, 1 ,2, 3 women and potentially impact fund raising.   In the early stages of my BC, my husband would do these Koman, Avon, ACS, functions.  One thing that I remember about these events were the luminaries (bags with lighted candles) for those that passed away.  The inference was that these men/women passed away in the \"bad old days\" before the advances in cancer care.  My advice to anyone into \"awareness\" is to get real, call NIH, and determine how many people are ever really rid of this disease.  The treatment for cancer is still, poison it, burn it, or cut it out.  Not all that much has change from the \"bad old days\".  How's that for those of you into \"awareness\".",

I feel that we are poorly served by conventional oncology.  When I ask and oncologist if they know how to take care of a stage 4 patient, some stare at me and others tell me how many of their patients are stage 4.  They seem unaware that the requirements are different and the diagnostic skill needed are much more advanced.",

My worst SE is constipation - very bad but I try to stay ahead of it.  The day after chemo I have very bad upper GI distress and have to double up on meds for this on the day after.  I then have a couple of good days (with exception of constipation) then towards the end of the week I have a couple of days (midday) where it feels like my head is going to drop in my lap.  I have a cup of tea and just try to push through it. Six to seven days out I've had bone pain in lower back, ribs, hips, and neck but I mainly ignore this an just rub these areas and apply heat.  I don't get the Neulasta shots so my bone pain is from the chemo.  I don't consider the SE's bad with this chemo but I'm on the reduced dosage.  My onc uses the CA27-29 so I'm not familiar with the one you are doing.",

I have not found anything close to this in my own fight and that is sad for me and many other stage 4 patients.  I've been through 3 Onc's and I'm soon to be at MD Anderson to try to find the elusive \"treatment of BC as a chronic manageable disease.\"  All I've essentially had for 4 1/2 years are Onc's that unimaginably work their way down the lists of hormonals and chemo's and move on to the next - a little like taking a number at the deli section - next! ",

I wanted to also comment on your appointment with palliative care and your Onc's comment.  I've had three Onc's and consulted with two others.  One of my favorite questions is \"Do you know how to work with a Stage IV patient?  The needs and complications are/can be very different.  When I ask this question, they look at me with a clueless look - sometimes they will recite how many stage IV patients they have - not really the same as \"knowing how to care for one\".",

My appointment is at 7 am on July 11th. I also understand the need to coordinate your current treatment.  When you say this to them, they suggest that you interrupt treatment but I can't right now.  I'm very fortunate (if that's the right word) to be on a \"once a month\" chemo which made the logistics possible. Also, they want you to plan to be there for 1 1/2 weeks.  They also informed me (after the appointment was made) that they would order my pathology slides from my former pathologist and redo the pathology.  They informed me that the insurance may or may not cover this - I'm letting you know this now so you can plan.  Personally, I'm only planning to be there for a week and will be staying at the Rotary House the night before the appointment - this hotel is next to the Cancer Center on University Property as I understand it. For the remainder of the week, we will be 12 miles away at an RV Resort. We do have the ability to extend our trip, if we need to but that would be more difficult for someone with air and hotel reservations. My advise to you is get through the paper gathering process ASAP.  I fax everything I collect as I collect it.  Also, keep in touch with your contact person frequently.",

Chemo for high estrogen is not effective even the dose dense chemo that I had.  Oh well, it's just my life - who cares but me. It would not have mattered what Onc or hospital I went to 5 years ago - this was common practice. Also, after re-reading your post, you seem to put a lot of trust in mammograms.  I had one every year and ended up with a large tumor and heavy node involvement.  These tests (Pet Scans, mammo's, CT Scans are not effective for many people but that's a whole different story.  If you are up for some really scarry reading, go to the Stage IV forum and find out how many women went from Stage 0, 1, 2, 3 under the care of Oncologists.  Both mother and daughter in this article would like to avoid this although it may be too late for mom. ",

Let me also point out a drug company trick called off-label prescribing.  Novartis got FDA approval for this drug for osteoporosis at two dosages per year.  Once they got FDA approval, they began to pedal this to Onc's for BC, Prostate, Lung Cancer, etc. Not only does this substantially broaden their market from a few old ladies with osteoporosis, they up the dosage to once a month. Yes, I'm angry about the two years that my insurance company paid for this drug - but I'm one of the lucky ones that does not have a cap on my insurance.  Some cancer patients are dealing with 350,000, 500,000, or 1 million dollar caps on their insurance - when the money's gone it's gone.  If Novartis wants to experiment on humans, let them advertise in the paper for volunteers, pay those volunteers in addition to free drugs, go through clinical trials and get FDA approval for this drug as a cancer preventative.  Let them do their own G. D. R&D - these drug companies make gobs of money off cancer patients.",

To make a long story short, she and I are doing a better job of sizing each other up and finally building a relationship after 6 months.  But let me tell you what I do - I pickup the scans from the organization that does them (last 5 years worth) and I hand carry them to her office.  The CD's come with a very descriptive typed report from the radiologist.  I read them, highlight them, and use them as the basis for my questions. I also graph all my blood work and can trend my platelets, TM's, liver function, you name it. What you also have to ask yourself is \"do you want this much information\".  I have to admit that I take a deep breath before reading these radiology reports.  The benefit of reading these reports is that you do have two medical doctors giving opinions about what they see. My Onc sometimes disagrees with the radiologist or takes a more conservative view but at least I have two opinions. Good Luck to you and keep us posted.",

I believe that one reason cancer patients are so keen on running around telling everyone that they are \"cancer free\" is that they need to misinterpret what the doctor is saying to them and the doctors don't correct them.  That's a whole other discussion that I ended up having with the same Onc referenced above.",

      "Content": "Jun 6, 2011 04:23PM - edited Jun 6, 2011 04:35PM by nurse-ann I have confirmed mets to peritoneum and pelvic floor muscle (exploratory surgery confirmed this), suspected mets to avioli in the lungs and possible mets to bone marrow.   I'm on oxygen 24/7. I had many PET scans with my first Onc and they never showed cancer even the day I was admitted to the hospital and almost died.  He kept waiting for the PET to show something and I damn neared died in the process.  My second and third Onc followed me with TM's and CT scans - with the CT scans they are looking as much for symptoms as tumors.  By that I mean they are checking for fluid in the abdomen (ascites) or fluid in the lung - the bodies reaction to the cancer rather than the cancer itself. Not only are these scans inadequate for many lobular patients (but not all lobular patients), what you have to really watch is that lobular can Met to very odd places like those I mentioned above - like microscopic critters that gum up the works in my lungs and bone marrow. What is critical for a lobular patient is to see an Onc that see's a lot of lobular (17% of BC patients).  If you are seeing a general Onc, many or most of these do not see enough lobular cancer.  I am currently seeing a Breast Onc at a University. I also wanted to add that I'm not sure that this is because the cells are less dense (I'll ask my Onc about this) but that lobular is kind of stringy - it very often does not form tumors, as such.  It strings itself out.  When the surgeon completed my surgery, she said that I had lobular cancer growing from the breast down into the nodes - very stringy.  In order for something to show up on a PET, I believe it has to be around half the size of a pea.",
