      "Content": "cami82 wrote: Hello all, My mom was diagnosed this week with stage IV breast cancer, mets to liver and bone. She apparently had a breast mass that she ignored for several months, unknown to all of us. Recently, she started developing symptoms of ascites and that is when she went to the doctor. We are all kind of reeling and unsure of what to do next. She is scheduled to have a port placed today, and if she gets the ok after her heart scan, will likely start chemo on Friday. Her prognosis with chemo was \"months, not years\". I am trying to be hopeful and also realistic. Has anyone dealt with a similar beginning to their stage IV story? I don't have much information at this point about the specifics of her type of cancer, or the meds that they will use for chemo. My parents chose to go to the appointments alone and I'm getting a lot of information secondhand. We have no family history of any kind of cancer, so this has truly blindsided us. I'm four hours away from my family, and planning on being with my parents as much as I can through this. My mom is everything to me. If you all would be so kind, I'd really like some tips on how to handle this and what to expect. My mom is very uncomfortable with the ascites, but they don't want to drain it at this point. Should we seek a second opinion about that? Any tips on helping her to be more comfortable? She has lost a lot of weight, and was already tiny to begin with. I'm trying to find ways to pack a lot of protein and calories into small meals for her, any advice you have would be so appreciated. What about supporting someone through chemo? Just any and all practical bits of advice on how to support her and what to expect would be great. Thanks for listening, and thanks in advance for any advice you can give me. Log in to post a reply",

And it gives me such hope to hear about your friend - I'm almost afraid to hope too much, but I guess that would be silly. We never know, right? Thanks for your helpful tips - I'm packing up my juicer to take home so I can go full hippie and make my mom green juices :-) At least we can put them in a wine glass and sit outside with them. Thanks for your response, and so sorry you are here as well.",

One day at time is good advice - we are planners and like to know the whole story ahead of time, so we are learning to slow down and take it one thing at a time. Hard to do! I wish you both the best.",
