No driving for a bit...this seems to vary a lot but it sounds like you have people lined up to chauffer your girls. I was a little dopey but functional.  Could I have made myself a lite lunch ?  Absolutely.  But you can't reach so make sure everything is low.  I took myself off the narcotics before the two week mark...too many side effects.  I was limited to lifting no more than 3 lbs.  That's not much.  You cannot do laundry.  My husband (bless him) did a lot.  I ordered groceries online and had them delivered.  The guy brought them in the house for me, I put them away.  A long list of friends cooked dinners.   What am I missing?  I did not need chemo or rads so won't be any help there.  I will say a prayer for you on Tuesday.  It will be OK...while I was dreading the surgery.  It was far easier than I imagined.",
