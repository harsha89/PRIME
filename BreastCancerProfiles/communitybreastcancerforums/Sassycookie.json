I am two weeks out from a lumpectomy and recovering nicely although I have nothing to compare it to. Margins were clear and lesion was small. I have early stage I Invasive Breast Cancer that is estrogen receptor positive. Two nodes were removed and they were negative so I am considering myself lucky. I went to my first post op visit with surgeon yesterday and everything looked good except I had a concern of a very small lump near the top of the skin in the aerola near the injection dye site that is a bit sore. She doesn't seem to be very concerned but can't dismiss it so I will have to go back in a month for a mammogram. She did do an ultrasound and saw something that was very round and smooth. It was not there prior to surgery. Has anyone else had reaction near the injection site? Log in to post a reply",
