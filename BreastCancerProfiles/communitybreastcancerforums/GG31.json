I am 47 and given the rate of growth am concerned that it is actually a phyllodes tumor which the surgeon will not comment on. Surgery date is booked. Anyone have a similar experience? Thank you!

I went every 6 months for an US to monitor them. Following the Jan. 6, 2017 US, the report came back as Bi-RAD 4a as the one lump had some atypical features and shadowing. I just went for my biopsy on Monday this week, the radiologist who performed the biopsy said he was \"mildly concerned\" so I am quite certain it is just another FA and I will have to continue to monitor it. I find out my results next Thursday so will let you know. It is very hard to not to worry and let your mind wander around. Hopefully it is just a pesky FA for you as well.",

At my recent US following in July of this year, the lump had grown considerably and is now just over 3 cm in size. (which I suspected on my own). I have surgery booked for September 8th. The rate in which it has grown makes me nervous about it being a phyllodes tumor. Given my age and the growth rate I believe it is best to have it removed. If it is bothersome, I recommend talking to your doctor or surgeon about having it removed.  ",

I am experiencing pain in the area of the lump, just wondering if anyone else experienced any pain. As an FYI: an excerpt from the US report reads \"This lesion has a bllobed appearance with the.larger of the components measuring 6x 6 mm In size and the smaller adjacent component measuring 7 X 5X 5 mm. The overall long and short dimensions of this bilobed lesion are approximately 13 x 7.5 mm . The larger of the components of the bllobed lesion demonstrates a dimension is somewhat taller than it Is wide. There Is some shadowing behind this component and demonstrates some atypical features\". BiRADS = 4a Thank you Log in to post a reply",
