It was smaller than my left after the last surgery but today after the 2nd treatment it has swollen tremendously. Any one else have this much swelling, this soon? Does this mean something?

How did you handle this? I am hoping I am a candidate because of all the things going on in my life I can not mentally deal with 6-7 weeks of whole breast rad.",

After speaking with her today she says the balloon is not in the right place and she can not give radiation. So, after having the balloon inserted for 8 days it will be taken out on the 9th day without radiation. I am going to take whatever steps necessary to find out what went on, why the delay in the beginning almost 3 months and the delay after the balloon was inserted and being told by her after simulation and checking position that it looked perfect she now says it is not in the right place and cannot do the radiation. She is scheduled to remove it tomorrow but I don't know that I want her to do it. Any suggestions, thanks for all of your help.",

      "Content": "Jul 6, 2011 08:22PM - edited Jul 6, 2011 08:28PM by Blackgama My first bout with this was in Dec 2009, I had a lumpectomy and was not told about any options except whole breast radiation for 6-7 weeks. Since I research and ask questions, and was told it was Stage I I refused radiation and Avastin. In Feb of 2011, I was diagnosed with a recurrence and my surgeon said it was a good thing I hadn't had the radiation. This time I decided I would have it  but I wanted partial breast internal radiation. My surgeon and Radiation Oncologist were informed prior to surgery. They had discussions before surgery. I had a lumpectomy again. Margins clear no reason not to have what I wanted either Savi or Contura Multi-lumen Catherer. I was advised to see a Plastic Surgeon which I did for consultation. He expressed such delight in my decision to have internal radiation and his disappointment in that many women do not reseach what options are out there. Now, although I am suppose to have  2 of the best doctors in the NYC area, I had my surgery in April 2011 and have been put off by my Radiation Oncologist until June 30 before having the Contura balloon inserted. My surgeon had to refer me to another surgeon because the cavity had formed so much scar tissue he felt this other surgeon would be better and I thank him for that. The other surgeon had a difficult time but found the cavity. The RO still has not started treatment, the ballon has been in 7 days she wants confirmation that the balloon is in the right place from the radiologist who did the first CT and he is on vacation. I am not sure what to do and am depressed by all of this. I am saying all of this to tell you to stay on top of your doctors do not let them get away with putting you off for months. If you can have brachytherapy internal radiation partial breast go for it, this is the best even partial breast external is something to consider before whole breast. I hope his helps and if anyone has any info they can give me I would appreciate it.",

I called the surgeon who put it in but he was in a meeting. I will call him in the morning. I have lost all confidence in my RO so I don't want her to take it out. I probably have so much scar tissue at this point that once the balloon is removed I would not be able to have this procedure. I will contact the Faber Center and speak with someone. I will keep intouch. Again thank you all.",

      "Content": "Jul 9, 2011 11:08AM - edited Jul 9, 2011 11:09AM by Blackgama Well, the surgeon who put the balloon in was not available to take it out. I had to let the RO whom I have lost all confidence in remove it. She wanted to talk before removing it and spent the time showing me the pictures (rays) and telling me she went above and beyond to try and do this. When I responded yes, you took 3 months and scar tissue built up while nothing happened. Her response, I sent you for a sonogram at the end of May. I was not going to be too confrontational after all she still had to remove the balloon. Any way it was removed, I have had no radiation, I am high risk have precancerous cells, this was a recurrence and am left very upset, saddened and depressed. I am not sure what my next step should be (I'm thinking a lawyer?) and who to turn to for help. Please someone give me some direction and/or a good lawyer. Thanks much",
