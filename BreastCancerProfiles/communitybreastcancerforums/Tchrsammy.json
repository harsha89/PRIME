    "Content": "Tchrsammy wrote: I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in February of this year. I immediately had surgery to remove one brain tumor; however, there was another inoperable tumor as well as four additional lesions in my brain. Following surgery, I underwent a gamma knife treatment in March. Since then, I've noticed changes in my skull. I can feel lumps & bumps & indentions that were not there before. Has anyone else had a similar experience after gamma knife radiation? I have an MRI scheduled on June 30, but I'm getting really nervous about these changes Log in to post a reply",
