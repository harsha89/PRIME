Makes me feel good knowing that there is someone across the ocean sharing her advice with me. I'm not sure how I would feel if my genetic testing came out positive. You mention its an option for planning my future, esp if i want kidsÂ - can you elaborate? I'm not really sure since i haven't given much thought to that. I know my bf and i at some point soon want to get married and would like to have a family. To be honest, I don't know much about genetic testing our counseling except for the extreme cases I've heard about where someone tests positive and then decides to have a preventative double mastectomy. Not sure if I'm getting ahead of myself in thinking about all these things since my biopsy results haven't come back yet. I'm just scared but it sounds like genetic counseling might be a first step since I'm such a worrywart. I live in the US so I don't know much about the process, if it's covered by insurance, etc so I'll have to look into that.",
