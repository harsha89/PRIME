    "Content": "Jul 13, 2010 11:13AM - edited Jul 13, 2010 12:13PM by MomduMatt I'm sorry to hear of your anguish and understand fully.  I urge you to get a second opinion from a breast cancer surgeon, best from a teaching hospital if possible.  My cancer, Stage I/II, was detected during routine mammogram, then immediately had sonogram, then sent for MRI on BOTH BREASTS to confirm NO OTHER LUMPS.  Then I had a lumpectomy on the only identified lump with a second surgery to get \"clear margins\".  All of this happened relatively quickly, though the short wait time between MRI and then the two ops was mentally excruciating.  Now I'm in the throes of deciding on treatment after meeting with one oncologist but waiting to speak with my GP for his opinion.  I know the mental anguish. My surgeon gave me a prescription for Xanax to help me with the waits and the ops.  I only took when I was on the brink.   I, personally, do NOT agree with the \"let's wait three months'.  Find yourself another breast cancer doctor and get another opinion.  Take charge of your health. Keep  posting on here and blessings to you.",
