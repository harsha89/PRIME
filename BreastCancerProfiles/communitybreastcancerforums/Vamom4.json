The left breast had the non-mass enhancement, 27 mm, homogeneous, type 2 kenetics. There was no other descriptor of shape or edges in the report. They did end up doing the U/S guided biopsy as they were able to locate the area on U/S (on the left). They took 5 or 6 samples, so hopefully they got the whole area. The fibroadenoma is in the right breast, MRI report states it is benign. I just would think that if it is just normal or fibrocystic tissue lighting up on the MRI it would be in both breasts. I'm hoping I'm wrong and it's not ILC. My husband thinks I'm a total hypochondriac",

I started seeing a high risk Dr. at the breast care center last January after I felt what I described as a thickening in the upper exterior of both breasts but mainly the left. The did a baseline mammo then immediate u/s on the left breast and told me I had dense breasts and likely what I was feeling was just normal tissue, bi-rads 3. I was told I'd need to alternate mammo and MRI every 6 months due to being high risk from the family history and I should consider genetic testing even though my grandmother tested negative for BRCA. This summer I tried to schedule the MRI but since the mammo showed a finding it flagged my chart and I couldn't get it scheduled without a follow up mammo. In Sept I had the follow up on the left breast and I immediately scheduled the MRI for Dec (even though the Dr. said I could wait until March.) I received the same report in the mail from the mammo, probably benign, bi-rads 3 (at this point I'm guessing they can't really tell due to the dense tissue). I had the MRI and the area in the left breast enhanced (type 2, non mass) and there was a fibroadenoma on the right. The radiologist called me to tell me it was probably fine, but warranted a biopsy, bi-rads 4. They scheduled me for diagnostic and biopsy yesterday. They did a full mammo (said I was due for my yearly screening) then took me to u/s for the left breast. It is a teaching hospital so the first radiologist said they'd look for the area on u/s and if they could find it they'd do the biopsy that way if not I may have to have a MRI guided biopsy. He also stated the area had changed or grown since the Sept mammo. He went to get the attending who came in and did the u/s again then said she thought it was likely just normal hormonal changes (I assume Fibrocystic Changes) and that I should wait a cycle or two and come back for another follow up mammo then we could see about a biopsy if needed. I'm not much of a wait and see person, so I asked her to just do the biopsy. My question is would fibrocystic tissue normally enhance on MRI only on the one side? I know that MRI is very sensitive, but the mammos never show anything, so why would I monitor it that way? I think I was just annoyed she was wanting me to take her personal opinion instead of a biopsy, the only way to really know. Log in to post a reply",

I just don't want to be overlooked or dismissed purely on age, since I have seen first hand the devastating effect that can have. Any advice or opinions are welcome, thanks!!",
