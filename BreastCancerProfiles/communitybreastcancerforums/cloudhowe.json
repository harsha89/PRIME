I have shocking advice, especiallly when I used to do this for others when I ran Crossroads.  My Doc has been FABULOUS!!!. Saw her today and she has prescribed  knock out drops and vailium.  God -I would love to just have a night's sleep! The valiam isn't working because I have so much adreniline pumping through me with panic, and apprehension. I, myself, took my pride out of the equasion, and called social work today and they are shocked at the advice given  by the McMillan CAB advisor. Before I am through, I will have that little lady hung out to dry. Sue, I am not a vindictive person, but I am consumed with RAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!. The First Time THE FECIN (remember I am not swearing moderator ...) FIRST I have been in need of hekp - sorely in need of help - I was refered to a numpty (translation - idiot, incompetant,) She didn't even know what was on THE McMILLAN FECIN WEBSITE, SHE SAID THAT IT WAS CORRECT THAT I WAS ONLY ENTITLED TO £60.50 P/W ON WHICH TO LIVE. IT IS ON THE McMILLAN HOMEPAGE !THAT CANCER (SUFFERS? VICTIMS? -DON''T KNOW HOW TO REFER TO MYSELF) IS AUTOMATICALLY ON THE SUPPORTED BAND - AT A SLIGHTLY ENHANCED RATE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Her boss is trying to get get me a grant to fix my boiler. Once that is done MS D^%& is in my firing line. You and I Sue, and all of us infested by this BOOTFACE will do more than this idiotic cretin - and possibley others like her, who - at our hour of need -has no FECIN idea what to do. The social worker to whom today was shocked, seems there is lots of help available for neccessities - I recon I have had to spent £500 in incidentals. hats,thermometor, scarfs, supplements etc. I have had one free scarf from The Haven and bought 5 more (£1.60 each) That and a grant for £200 for the excessive cold we have had and my insane feul bills,£140 PER MONTH BY DIRECT DEBIT for electricity alone) even though I have had no cental heating.  Oh bejebs, I am enjoying the feeling of anger - that positive and channelling AND there is going TO BE SOME SERIOUS CAMPAIGING. My Doc and I are outraged that after a lifetime of work I have to resort to a begging bowl. WOW THAT FEELS GOOD. WELCOME TO NETTIE MY SWEET DARLINGS SISTERS. There is a battle to be waged, here in the UK and for my newfound sisters in the US and elsewere. Not just for treatment, not just for research, not just for dignity when we are at our lowest - but for involvement, respect, consideration, consulatation, COMPETANCE - wee bit of a burning issue with me at the moment - and support. My echocardiogram is being brought forward to 9pm tomorrow (Wed - the techie has has a bereavnent - poor soul) and the biopcy is Thur at 8am. Please keep me in your thoughts. If there is anyone in the UK logging on here, we need to hear fron you. I don't believe it is the intention of this government to put such as I through this torture, but it is the result of their policies, If there are any SCOTTISH loggers, even more important, We have more input. My dear friends, I must away. Sue If you could e-mail me, I'd be forever in your debt. With a heavy, but fiercesome heart, I wish you all, my staff and my rod, a peaceful nighr's sleep. P.S I'm not that scary. But some will learn ro fear me. Not you kids, I truly appreciate all of the support, help and  warmth I have had. As always, love you lots like jellytots Nets xxxxxx",

It was awful for my sister as she took our bro to the same room  for his treatment - his chemo was every day for the first course - the gullet is a vicious bootface. So she was upset today. For me, it was unthreatening and I was almost disappointed that the FECing treatment was'nt going to shrink the FECKER lurking in my wee (E cup!) unsuspecting boobie there and then. So just bloods, bp and reassurances and the treatment starts tomorrow - 1.30 our time. Be on your guard you fecking wee jobbie (I refer to you to our venacular aforementioned 'jobbie' is scottish for poo ) my blessed FEC - my chemo - is going to gobble you up just like PACMAN chasing the baddies. I emailed Sue and hoped for a response - insisted that she call NHS direct and they would taxi her to hosp 24/7. Even in England! Certainly she cannot dismiss any worrying symptoms. As a doctor dodger all my life, this is a lesson hard learned. I will be running not dawdeling to the hosp if I, or any of my family has the slightest cause for concern. Still havent been for a wig fitting! My hosp appts keep changing so I  have had to reappoint twice, and on Monday, the stylist was ill, so I will be on chemo before I get a fitting. Life is not plain sailing. BUT ... we have had 2 beautiful warm, blue sky SPRINGLIKE days here in Scotland - the daffodils and hyachnths are popping their wee heads seeking the sun - 10 dys ago, we has minus 16 degrees, blizzards and we - now, this is SCOTLAND - had no grit for the ancillary roads!!! We get really cold up here anyway - Glasgow is on a higher latitude than Moscow (silly bit of trivia, we have a town - well village - called Moscow in Ayrshire, and a town called Houston in Renfrewshire. Your Houston? Probably founded by a Scot doncha think?) but this last month is the coldest that I have ever known. Takes a LOT for a Scottish school to be closed. Buhlieve me! cannot ever remember it happening to me in my childhood. Global warming,of course - respect the Kyota agreement. But it feels like Spring looks like it's putting a wee tentative entrance. Ad it's getting lighter in the morning and it's not gettng dark till 5.30, so that lifts my spirits. I'm desperate to get out into the garden - really restricted because of my shoulder, and was warned in the notes at the hosp that you have to avoid rotting vegatation - I leaf mulch over winter to nurish the soil and repress weeds. Bootface does restrict so much of what you want to do. But will do as I'm told. Oh God, me and my sudden January dx insomnia - just cannot sleep. After the hosp today we went for lunch, went shopping, visited my darlin Auntie Bettie ( my mum's wee sister who is a teenage pensioner who says things that make my neice blush) Then I went to buy her birthday pressie in Glasgow - 10 miles away from my village - got my lovely new NOKIA 71 - wow oh wow, came home, cousin Yvonne cropped by, we watched The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, which I bought 3 years ago when it was published) with a bottle of Jacoks Creek. But it's now 1.44 am UK time. Sue, if you are logging on, IN THE NAME OF GOD, let me/us know that you are attending to your needs. Sue I'm going for my 1st FEC tomorrow so I need you to contact me to wish me well. Enjoy your time with your darling dad. My brothers, sister and I ADORED our Daddie who died a few years ago. But even if you are in the Lake District, allow your dad the PRIVILIGE of escorting you to Carlisle hospital to check you out. There can only be 2 things:- 1).You are a hypochrondiac (please GOD yessssssss....)  Best scenario. And remain so...   'better safe than sorry'. That is me. I always ignore anything that does not involve my skeleton, breaks etc... I thought that ilness was at least partially illusionary/indulgance/imagination etc 2) OR. You are ill, So there can only be 2 other things 2i) You have an infection of some sort -non cancer related - of which there many. Must must be addressed (Says I who have never finished a course in antibiotics .... BUT WILL NOW) 2ii) OR You have a cancer related infection, like somthing relating to you lymph biopsy - which if you have been reading the posts are perhaps likely, then clearly you need to read them, because I have not been down that path. I had my biopsy - get my result on Monday, starting my acutual chemo tomorrow tomorrow 1.30 our time. If you do not resond you will have deserted me. I am going to make this public Sue, as I put in the email I sent you. You must cut down your hours at work. Your employer CANNOT, BY LAW, refuse to allow you this. Or demote you because of your illness. Or dicriminate against against you.",

Got 2nd FEC on Friday and the fatigue has hit me badly this time - couldn't wake up today!!!! So I am now really tired and unable to sleep! My hair is all but gone and my scalp is really sore - like sunburn. Can't wait to haave it shaved on Friday - I think I look like something from a horror film about radiation. No end problems this time though! Thank god for Movical and Majool Dates!!!!!! Still clinging on to my lashes but expect them to go too. I have lashes that almost touch my brows (with the help of Max Factor) so I know that I am going to look really odd without them. I think the tumour has shrunk though. It is so surface and is attached to the skin in my cleavage so is quite accessable. Finances have been a nightmare. I have a Welfare Rights Officer who contacted my bank for me to suspend my loan repayments and they refused because it it a Solvent Account!!!  I hve never even used my overdraft with them, so am taking out all of my reserves and putting it into my credit union account!!!!! They know that my income is vitually nothing for the first 13 weeks of DX - I should be on much higher rate. like Sue, but in the meantime I am worrying more about money than this horrible disease. I actually told my sister today that I wish I was terminal, because then at least there would be some sort of support. I have found the MacMillan nurse to be patronising.  How dare they sit and take notes while telling you that they can do NOTHING practical to help. Actually I HATE the MacMillan CAB. They are totally useless. The social worker and the OT are also shocked because they have tries to see if there is anything they can do and there isn't. Not even to get a shower installed (mine is on it's last legs ) or help in getting it installed if I buy one, which I will have to. I kind of crashed today - this is the first time I have allowed myself to feel sorry for myself, so please forgive me. Oh a wee bit of news. Simon my lovely wee Irish oncy had a verbal report that I am not Trip neg - I am HER2 +, does not have it in writing yet tho'!  The hospital care has been outstanding. I LOVE my GP, my darling Dr Shona and Mr Musa the sugreon is an angel of God. He holds your hand and says  \"I will take very good care of you\" Strangly, the surgery holds no fear for me. Is this normal? Or do you think it will crash in on me.  I don't know? On your fabbie posts my dear friends. Portia you look quite lovely my dear, what a beautiful pic! How is your yummy mummy. It is so good to get good news and yours was the BEST. Lisa, good luck with Michael, he sounds absolutly lovely.  I had my suspicions about the other guy with the 2 names. I think you had a lucky escape and it is great to hear the enthusiasm in your 'voice'. Yours is the voice of a survivor and I love it. AE. we havent 'talked' but I love reading your posts and I am sending my warmest best wished to you and your dear husband. This bootface is like a biblical plague!! Cathi, how is your daughter?? Your poor love. It IS easier to go through this that to watch someone you love face this.  My sweet brother told me that and I now know it to be true.  I miss him so much!!!!! God, I don't know where that came from!! Margot is a poppet, I love when my sis visits wih Tommy, her rescue cross collie. He smiles!!!!!!! And is sooooo goofy and lovable. He licks you twice and cuddles you. Oh and your granddaughter is soo very, very lovley. You must be so pround of her. She looks like she should be in magazines. Nana, how are you faring sweetheart - going through the same thing as me, we need to support each other. The hair thing isn't trivial. It hurts and, of course, it was the first thing the Nazi did to the inhabitants of the camps because so much of our ID is in our hair and eyes. I am using scarves till I get my wig, but I finding it really hard because I have such restricted use of my right arm. I went out with my cousin's son on Saturday with my bandana and yes, I did get some looks from the neighbours. No-one quite knows what to say, do they? Which is way this thread has beeen such a life line. Judie, I love, love, love your posts. You are an absolute wordsmith. Conner, too, is a doll!! What absolutly beautiful children you all have!!!  Your sweater is lovely too.  What a nice idea to knit. I used to knit Icelandic sweaters for everyone on circular needles.  I worked for several years in Shetland where EVERYONE, even the chaps, knit. And my maternal grannie (Irish) always has 'things on the needles' She was a genius - no pattern required. When my sis and I were at primary school, (we are only 18 months apart in ages) we used to get taken round all the classes with her creations. So embarrassing! My mum was a seamstress too, so all of our clothes were handmade. I wanted to be dressed like everyone else from Wollies!!! So I will take that up again. But it is expensive, the last thing I knitted was a chenille jacket and - then - if cost me about £60 in wool!! Jane, how are you girl, what's the weather like with you. We are getting more spring like weather now, but it came as a shock how cold my head was, even when I started to shed hair!! Please come back to Scotland. I also lived in Aviemore in the heart of the Cairmgorm mountains in the Spey Valley (breathtaking) and there wer so many Kiwi and Austalians there the villiage was called Aussiemore!  I love Antipodians, so laid back and I made many friends, In fact, I has a visa to live in Australia after Shetland, but my wee mum was ill and I couldn't bear to move so far away. Haste ye back pet, and I promise to show you Ireland. And The Highland and Islands. You have my word. I actually get free bus travel throughout Scotland for myself and a companion, so you can travel free!!! Sweet Sue, you are superwoman!  I am a big girl - eat almost nothing, honestly it's true and I lost only about 5 pounds since Jan.  I was always active though - loved going up the hills, but the thought of RUNNING 5 miles post cancer is awesome. Would love to meet up, perhaps in Blackpool - I can get lots of freebies as my family live down there. Lots oof free funfair rides etc - you couldbring the kids!!!! I feel weak and breathless just now. I know that's normal because one of the drugs I am on is cardiotoxic. Thank god I have only got 2 more sessions.  Does anybdy know why I am on only 4 sessions given the awful diagnosis - big tumour, attached to the skin, poorly diffentiated, high grade, spread to the lymph nodes ....... I just realised that my course is so short .... getting an hour of complimentary therapy on Friday when Isabel will shave my head.  Will be so much better being bald that with these pathetic wisps of hair!!!!!!! Might feel better when I get the wiggy if it is like my own style. Why are we ashamed of having cancer, or being obviously ill with it? Praying I don't lose my facial hair, Please god spare me that!!!!!!!! How can I thank you girls for letting me get all of this off my chest. Strange how much this helps. I really love you all. Forgive me for rambling, Another sleepless night ahead.  I am a voracious reader, but find that I can't concentrate. reading the paper is about as much as I can do. I am going for..... wait for it ..... a US Guided Marker Insertion Breast Left examination on Thursday 26th March. Please keep me in your prayers that the tumour will have shrunk. Doncha think it sounds like Star Wars??  Going for a bath and try to catch some zzzz s it#s now 3.18 am here in bonny Scotland. With all my love Nettie xxxxxxxx",

That's why they started to make them round, I'm convinced, to sit on the eye orbit.

Had the family up for the evening - it's our Wednesday date, and dosed (watching Dancing on Ice - yes, I am addicted!!!) after they left and I cleared up. I was worried that my Auntie might have been upset at me wearing a bandana (I love her to fragments, but she is very appearance concious, and I did have nice hair) and my wee niece The Claire Bear, who has hair down to her wee bum, but they were absolutly cool!!!! So we had great craric (Irish for FUNTIME). So much easier if you don't feel that your are passing pain on to your special folk. I am getting my new (BRAND NEW) TV replaced - it has developed a fault, so they will be replacing it tomorrow, any time between 7am and 6pm!! It's 6.02 just now so I think I will have a steep in a boiling hot bath (got a jaccuzi type thing) for an hour. I LOVE boiling hot baths, so much that I almost crawl to bed hyperventilating,  Have to stop once I get the lymph nodes removed so I am just packing in as much of a boiled lobster-fest before I have to be more sensible! Nurse usually comes about 10ish. Think I'll learn to give my jabs myself. I'll need the nurses post op and they are great, but it'a kind of tying waiting in .... My nephew is coming up to take delivery of my tv and install it into the Virgin box, DVD and all that happy crappy. Once he extracts himself from hia 'scratcher' (bed) What is it about boys and waking/getting up????? Is that just a Scottish thing???? That'll give me time to get my rug trimmed (bought one today over the Intenet as a stopguard) and - all being well - take a trip down to Glasgow to Maggies Centre. That's a FABOULOUS place for all of those afffected by Cancer (sufferers, family, friends ....) - it's a converted gatehouse to a hospital and it warm and welcoming beyond belief.  I am soon to be booked into a 2 hour pampering session with a trained make up artist and therapist and we get about £400 of make up to take home - all top brands. Carol, the Welfare Rights Officer is also based there and she is an absolute warrior an she will be acting on my behalf. So that's the plan. Provisional plan .. See if any of it works out. Cathi my wee pet. I  don't know if this will give you any solace, but I know DOZENS of girls who have had abnormal PAP's (including a mix up myself at one point) and I do not know of anyone for whom it turned out to be serious. We used to call it 'erosion' and laser just burned off the cells.  I was speaking to my sis, who is a nurse, last evening, and she, too, knows of lots of girls who have been through this, including sweet Sue. Telling you not to worry would be like telling you not to exhale, but it's probably nothing like our journey. The waiting is purgatory I know. On a lighter note, how's wee Margot? I still think that pic of her wee sorry face after a bath is a hoot? Sue - have a boring year off, running marathons and being a yummy mummy with absolutly no tummy. Ok - off for my boiling session - how red can a wee white woman go - you have no idea!. I look like I have Scarlett Fever. Know it's bad but it feels soooooo good. Lots of flower essential oils and a good dash of Philosopy's Pure Grace Both Smellies- I love that smell - and water so hot it'll take the skin off you. Lovely, as always catching up on everything.

The surgery holds no fear for me, pain doesnt, the rads WILL burm - but my old pal Aloe Vera will take care of that. I scalded my leg last night (misplaced cup of boling hot tea), chopped off a frond of my plant and applied it. My nephew shrieked 'That plant must hate you' - but I told him that it was only a wee trim for Vera!) The soles of my feet are burning and my heels cracked, but I got a wee tub of Shea Butter for that, from the hospital. Love you all Nettie Xx ",

He remembered dying, and that the dog walking beside him had been dead for years. He wondered where the road was leading them. After a while, they came to a high, white stone wall along one side of the road. It looked like fine marble. At the top of a long hill, it was broken by a tall arch that glowed in the sunlight. When he was standing before it he saw a magnificent gate in the arch that looked like mother-of-pearl, and the street that led to the gate looked like pure gold. He and the dog walked toward the gate, and as he got closer, he saw a man at a desk to one side. When he was close enough, he called out, 'Excuse me, where are we?' 'This is Heaven, sir,' the man answered. 'Wow! Would you happen to have some water?' the man asked. 'Of course, sir. Come right in, and I'll have some ice water brought right up.' The man gestured, and the gate began to open. 'Can my friend,' gesturing toward his dog, 'come in, too?' the traveller asked. 'I'm sorry; sir, but we don't accept pets.' The man thought a moment and then turned back toward the road and continued the way he had been going with his dog... After another long walk, and at the top of another long hill, he came to a dirt road leading through a farm gate that looked as if it had never been closed. There was no fence. As he approached the gate, he saw a man inside, leaning against a tree and reading a book. 'Excuse me!' he called to the man. 'Do you have any water?' 'Yeah, sure, there's a pump over there, come on in.' 'How about my friend here?' the traveller gestured to the dog. 'There should be a bowl by the pump.' They went through the gate, and sure enough, there was an old-fashioned hand pump with a bowl beside it.. The traveller filled the water bowl and took a long drink himself, and then he gave some to the dog. When they were full, he and the dog walked back toward the man who was standing by the tree. 'What do you call this place?' the traveller asked. 'This is Heaven,' he answered. 'Well, that's confusing,' the traveller said. 'The man down the road said that was Heaven, too.' 'Oh, you mean the place with the gold street and pearly gates?   Nope. That's Hell.' 'Doesn't it make you mad for them to use your name like that?' 'No, we're just happy that they screen out the folks who would leave their best friends behind.' Repied the man. Smiling. Yeah, who would want a heaven without our animals  NETTIE XXXX               ",

The last 2 weeks I have been overwhelmed with fatigue, loke everything is too much of an effort, even making a hot drink. My onc nurse says it's commmon for the fatigue to be cumulative, but I feel so weary and weak, most unlike me! I am going away the day after chemo to allow my living room to be done, new walls and architraving, but be back in time for my  jabs. Will have to now discuss surgery with my Breast sureon and I don't know if i am ready for that.

It's a simple procedure using a wee anchor. You poor wee thing - no wonder you've beenin pain.

I truly love Ireland and we had a great, great time. The wee village my dad came from has a Saint buried, one of St patricks early monks, buried there. He died in 500 AD! And a 1000 year old Viking round tower (well, it was built by by the monks to protect holy relics FROM the Vikings) My family has a lair there nad my brother Charles' ashes were scattered there ... very beautiful and ... timeless .. If I can ever work out how to post pictures, will do so. Shiela, so awfully sorry about Penelope. What you did took great courage and is the ultimate act of great kindness. Hugs sweetie. Cathi, what can I say! Another wee cutie in your pool. How do the babies rub along? And how is Jacklyn? I would love to be part of a big chaotic household, like the one I grew up in (I have 42 cousins, 3 Aunites on mum's side and 6 uncles on dad's side) Everything had to be shared. I am so selfish now, of my stuff, my time, even the TV remote. The wages of living alone!! Sound like you are coping well and SETTING THE HOUSE RULES. Absolutely de rigour, my sweet! Good luck! Wee Margot enjoying all the extra attention I have no doubt. Nanci, prayers winging your way for your daddy. All I can say is treasure the time you have with him, every precious second. Well, started dental work yesterday and getting a veneer fitted next Thur. That's all I need done in the meantime. I thought I had lots of work to get done, but it was all pretty minor. Getting bloods done on Friday, Herceptrin on Monday (an all day thing!!!!) and Taxetere on Tue and confess I am feeling nervous. I got used to FEC, harsh as it was. Got a wee covering of (bizarrly mostly silver!!!!!!!!) hair, which I will lose again. Will anything ever be back to normal?? I am a bit concerned about the possibility of permanent s/e, I have been warned that there might be. Any of you wonderwomen out there care to share experiences? They are talking about 4 courses, but might stop at 2, if the symptoms become \"intolerable\". I'll tell you lassies, it will take a helluva lot for anything to be \"intolerable\" for me, but they are being very non-specfic. Any advice most gratefully welcomed!!!! More worry about money, I have come to the end of my 28 weeks WTC, so my Welfare rights officer is going to apply for State benefits, which makes me feel vaguely ashamed!! I know that I am entitled to them and that I have contributed to them all of my working life. So this is a transition period for me in many ways. Thank god I can vent on these pages!! Got enough for a couple of months, so putting real worry on the back burner till I can get to grips with new chemo. Got some calls to make now, to Carol, my welfare rights officer, the bank who screwed up my Direct Debits transfers .... the power company to set up new Direct Debit (direct payment on a monthly basis fro my bank account) Everything seems such an effort. By the way, love your new picture Lisa!!!! Sorry you have had kid's problems. fro what I can see, your daughter MUST know you are a magnificent mother, and they are just trying to be good granddaughters. Which is a credit to YOU madam! To all of you Amazons with health problems - Barbe, I am talking to you. Turn my back for a fortnight and you let a wee Mick mess around with you!!! Hope you are feeling a million per cent better pet. Need your humour and WISDOM!!! Like Shirley and Judie, wise women all. Anyway hope all your health and family concerns resolve themselves soon. Seeing if I can remember the Irish Wish (I used to know it verbatim, and was reminded of it ,,, here goes ... I think) May the sun be warm on your face May the wind always be at your back And till we meet again May God hold you in the palm of his hand. And on a lighter note, and this one is ESPECIALLY for you Cathi ... May the roof of your house never fall in And those within it never fall out . Still loving you all like jellytots Nettie xxx",

My bloods were too  low at pre chemo to proceed but bounced right back. I am so relieved it has started and waiting anxiously for any side effects. I have been pretty sick but am pretty sure that it was just the bug. Hand is  a black and blue mess as they found it almost impossible to get the cannula in, Herceptrin through the wrist and Tax through the thumb in the end. Hopefully we will avoid installing a port. They can't use my at risk arm so pretty restricted, alas! Herceptrin costs £30,000 oer year. Thank god we have the NHS. One lady at the Herceprtin clinic is on her 47th treatment!. I had thought it was a number limited treatment. However, it is so reassuing that there is no limit based on cost if it is needed. (Incidentally, please do not believe any negative news on cancer and the NHS, I and my family have had the most superb care on the planet..) Oh laptop working like a wee pussycat by the way. Any news of Blossom? Was she ill or poorly, or old? Cats do go on adventures so hopefully that's all it is. My 3 wee cats have had colds, and wee Ted (the Ned) got really pretty sick a couple of days ago - sent me into a panic, but she had came round. I love the wee guys to distraction. They love it when all I can do us veg out and watch tele (will be on that train again soon) as they just join me on the sofa and go into a purr fest! Great to have you back Barbe, miss your wit and wisdom big time. Hope the wedding was a blast and bet you were the life and soul. Do you miss Mick? Cathi, Landen is a wee doll! You guys are great at capturing moments! I would love to be in a noisy, chaotic house for a while. Silence can be ringing! I love living alone, having guests, which I do a lot. Usually glad to have the house back to myself ... but sometimes ..... Oh well Lisa, the concert looks great, fulfill a great wish? I l love live gigs and seeing heros. I love festivals but couldn't go to anything this blasted year because of bootface.Pics were great and you looked radiant. Good to hear Dennis is tolerating FEC and that you are on good terms. He will be grateful for your knowledge, insight and support Ihave no doubt. The path reports of my tumour showed that it was less than a year old, had growm to 5cm and would have killed me within a year had we not caught it when we did. Scary, and humbling. Another girl at the Tax and Herceptrin clinic has EXACTLY (it seems) the same type of cancer, but her's didn't respond as mine did to FEC. Her tumour wa 10cm (and she has very small boobs) it was soft like normal breast tissue and even her doc didn't think it a cause of concern, just like mine. FEC shrunk it to 8cm so she is getting Herceptrin and Tax, and poss rads before she has her mx. So I am lucky, lucky, lucky, and Carol thinks she is too because so many of us walk around with this silent terrorist within us, detected only when it is too late. Like I said - scary but humbling. Both my breast consuiltant and my onc consultant haave both retired, so I can't even thank them. Thank god they stuck around long enough to save my life. Hope all goes well with you lovlies and praying that sweet wee Blossom finds her way home, and learns her lesson not to stray. With heartfelt hugs to you all Nettie xxx",

All that thought put in by Tom and your friends! I so glad you struck the motherlode pet. Cathi, your break sounds like you will have a blast, and do you ever deserve it. You should get award for what you have done for your girls. I know I have said this before, but Alexis is one of the most beautiful children I have ever seen, and baby Ella is a picture. You have a lot of reason to be proud. Now it's time to take care of Cathi. Nancy, you will be torn, leaving your family home and good memories.

Wishing you all the very best with the move! Karen, I am so sorry about your cousin. This stinking, filthy, indiscriminate disease is bloody endemic. A friend who was diagnosed a couple of months before me had a young neighbour who cleaned her house, shopped etc for her and now SHE has been dx with b/c! No one is safe. I can't help but worry about my 5 neices .... I suppose all we can do is be supportive and positive and trust in the medical team. I do hope she gets the best case scenario results. Do let us know. Jane, how lovely to hear from you! Jealous because you are getting such warm weather ... hope your son and his partner resolve matters. Cancer throws all our perspectives out of kilter don't you think? It's hard to think straight, especially if it's a close family member. I think it's easier to go through it than to watch someone we love go through it. Judie, what a good looking baby boy you have! Couldn't open the video link alas. Glad he found a local IKEA. That'll meet all his household needs, and so cheaply! I would have hated for him to be ripped off (I am Scottish, after all ....) What is he studying? And is he settling in ok? He'll have found a nice \"local\" (pub) by now I'll betcha! And at least it's not quite so Baltic now! If he needs a surrogate 'mum', well he has one! Shiela, hope you mum is continuing her recovery. It's good to know that she knows when she needs to rest. pass on my regards please. Barbe, need some 'barbed' comments. You make me howl Got a bit of a stinking cold just now (everybody has!) and got my chipped tooth (from the fall) fixed on Friday. Still feeling a bit weak and not much of an appetite. I am finding it hard to take 5 fruits/veg a day (and I am a veggie) but that will come in time. The rad burns, whcih were discribed as 'severe' have all but healed now. I used honey and the self adhesive dressings and they are great now. I have returned the gels they gave me. I used them through 6 weeks of rads but I know that honey works with burns for me. It's both sterile and healing. Oh and my eyebrows have grown back in less than a fortnight! Hope the lashes follow suit!  It's all good ladies (still a bit trepidarious about seeing my onc consultant though ......) I don't seem to have any s/e from Herceptrin now thats all I am getting. The worst is behind me!!!!!!!!! Well ladies, Dancing on Ice is due to start and I just looooooove it. Heather Mills is on (no-one like her, but you would have to be very ungenerous not to admire her spunk) and some of hte guys are awesome! With warmest best wishes Nettie xxxxxxxxxx",

She doesnt think the leg is broken and thought it best to leave it for a day to let the auld sweetie de-stress.Plus he was starving and ate, so they couldn't knock him out!!  Right now, he's on my couch enveloped in my goose down quilt, on 2 furry hot water bottles and has just had lemon sole!! By tomorrow, he'll be up to getting prodded etc. Yeah Barbe, his wee sister did go out to fetch him home. They love each other, they cuddle up and give each other full body massages -and she is his image, just half his size. A bit like Me and mini-me from Austin Powers! Thanks again guys. Great to be among animal lovers who empathise. Will try to post a pic if he gets a \"stookie\" - Scottish for a plaster cast! Looking forward to a great weekend now. We are all meeting up, all we girls diagnosed last year, on Saturday and for the first time most of us will be able to attend (there have always been some of us too sick, hosp appointments etc). Now we will be well enough for a total blast. Mucho vino I predict will be gargled. Oh can you spare a wee prayer for my friend Shiela? Her cancer is secondary and she has just has 5 of 9 (yes 9 tax) She has now got 3 blood clots in her arm, face and neck and is in hosp, spitting mad that she won't make it on Saturday. The clots seem to be under control but is scary, so they are not letting her out till they have disipated. She is a great girl and has had an awful time on Tax, so prayers and vibes. They really do work. Downloaded the Nomination form for the National Honours for the oncy staff nurse I so love and admire. Process seems simple enough but is prolonged - at least 12 - months. Aslo need to get Martin's details and he cannot be informed. Also need to get the support of all the other folk who think just the world of him as well ... Have the best weekend guys, Do loads of fun things, spend money on fripperies, cuddle your furbabies and your old men. Oh the snow is melting now. Thick fall last night........

Cathi - what great pictures you take, really captures the moment. Ella looks just beautiful. I cannot believe how healthy she looks. A true wee miracle. The expression on her face looking over your head is stunning. BUT need some more pics of ubercutie Margot. And how are you? Hoping to see Devin when he makes a flying visit to Scotland this week.

At worst, I had my wee sensors either side of my ruptured disc, the machine in my pocket, went to work and put it on when the pain became too bad to walk (or, at one point, breathe deeply) Not a cure, but it confuses the nerves transmitting the pain. Sciatic pain is so bad - it the the longest nerve in the body. Have you tried chiropracty (sp)? I hate being weak too.

I am taking buscopan and peppermint oil capsules and they are deffo keeping the spasms at bay. I might need surgery (would like to get it done and dusted to be frank) but not fit for it just now. Affter my recon next year I would like to have the afffected area removed so that I can have my old life back to an extrent rather than have the attack.  I am seeing some of you oB, but can't really love it. Like so many of you, I have ayoung friend who is succuming to bootface, they are giving her Zenola (?) and herceptrin, but don't know if it will work. She has been a rock through this adventure, havign been dx 3 months before me wiht a very similar prognosis. She can actually feel the mets growing internally. liver, lungs, abdomen and chest wall, and has ecomevery ill, very fast. She has even been undergoing trials at the world famous Royal Marden in London to no avail. Heartbreaking. We had a benefit for her last Sat. It was a blast and she looked glorious and is soooooo incredibly positive and fun! I was ready to throw in the towel after 2 TAX because of all the s/e - the effects which will be with me for life incidentally -and it was Sharon's example that gave me the strength to finish the course. So please spare a prayer. I am meeting her on Monday - Herceptrin day for us both - and we will go for lunch and drinks with my sister and her mum. She has been featured on Breastcancercare.org.uk and in the local press, so inspitring is her story. There but for the grace o God .... Shiela, THE BESTEST of luck in your job hunt. Your current employer will gve you the most glowing refernce I am sure and your new boss will be the luckiest boss around. Babies are still a joy. Amy got out for 2 hours last week to see her grannie and is in a ward now, so out of danger. Poor wee mite will see a lot of hospitals in her formative years. The have concluded that she has hearing in the side where she has no external ear! So it wll be a cosmetic thing to fashion an ear for her. She has some lobe tissue. The consutant is verry optimistic and thinks her problems will be mostly behind her in time. It's just so very hard for her mum and dad. Lilly Rose is a bundle of fun. We are all going down South for her christerning on the 4th July - we also have a hen night onthe 3rd for a very dear friend, so it will be a packed weekend. I have treated myself to a new netbook with bluetooth,s o will FINALLY be able to transfer some photos from my phone, which is bluetooth enabled! I am a lousy photographer so don't take many pics, so be warned. I will be staying down in Blackpool for about a week - it's the most popular holiday resort in Britain so I am lucky hat so many of my family and friends live there. I have my own room in my cousin's (Lilly Rose's GRANDFATHER - he is only 42! and we LOVE teasing him mercilessly about it) house.We ar thinking of then going over to Ireland for a week or so. My wee niece Carol is staying in Dunegal at the moment and loving it. Her best friend from Uni is from Dunegal, and we have family there (grandparents hailed from Dunlow and Letterkenny) I am now almost free of hospital routine, herceptrin excluded, so am plannig some breaks. I still exhaust really easily though! Wish you guys could pond hop over here to join us!

Don't ever squeeze or bruise them. And give them monthly tests. So I heeded all their warnings, And protected them by law. I guarded them most carefully, And I always wore my bra. After 30 years of gentle care, My doctor, Dr. Pruitt, Said I should get a Mammogram. \"O.K,\" I said, \"let's do it.\" Stand up here real close\" she said, (She got my boob in line), And tell me if it hurts,\" she said, \"Ah yes! Right there, that's fine.\" She stepped upon a pedal, I could not believe my eyes, A plastic plate came slamming down, My boob was in a vice! My skin was stretched and mangled, From underneath my chin. My poor wee boob was being squashed, To Swedish Pancake thin. Excruciating pain I felt, Within it's vice-like grip. A prisoner in this vicious thing, My poor defenceless tit! \"Take a deep breath\" she said to me, Who does she think she's kidding?!? My chest is mashed in her machine, And woozy I am getting. \"There, that's good,\" I heard her say, (The room was slowly swaying.) \"Now, let's just do the other one. \u2018Have mercy,' I was praying. Next time that they make me do this, I will request a blindfold. I have no wish to see again, My knockers getting steamrolled. If I had no problem when I came in, I surely have one now. If there had been a cyst in there, It would have gone \"ker-pow!\" This machine was created by a man, Of this, I have no doubt. I'd like to stick his balls in there, And see how THEY come out.

VERY hard to prove. I do have a friend who was a manager in Edinburgh and they merged his job so that he could'nt meet the meetings as they overlapped, because he was responsible for everything from industrial lawnmowers to huge trucks. He lost his first trial - brought him to the point of ruin - but won the appeal, so got a handsome settlement of £400,000 - but had to fore- go his pension. But I have known several times that it is so difficult to prove that it is just dismissed. If they want you out, they will find a way. My natural instinct would be to fight them to the death, but like others, I would just negotioate through the channels, and get the best deal that you can get. There are vicious cuts throught the globe. Cathi, What a minefield you are managing, my wee pal. You are doing so well, being TUFF and caring.A tightrope act for sure. And how be you, Catherine? A wee bit of sadness of recent times, I'm afraid.

I don't know why they are allowed to stay with their sad excuses of parents. Appeal to the CW's superiors, seek lagal advice. Here, I would consider involving the press, SIL is lost to you and Amanda might be too, so you have nothing to lose. I wish I could be more help, I can't imagine what you are going through. You know how much I resent those 2 eejits. The kids are the one and only thing that matters. The best case scenario is youand Ed gtting custody, with full financial and practical support and the eejits going into some kind of rehab. Never out of my thoughts Cathi. xxxxxx Leesa, news from the front? It's shameful how good, hard working people are treated throughtout the world by hard, faceless coporations. Do you not have a Union youcan turn to to get the best deal, or one of those \"no win, no fee\" outfits, or a law society or anyone who can offer you guidance and support? Failing that, I'm with Barbe. Negotiatewith the swines who did this to you (I still think that would be best done by someone conversant in Employment Law. The very best of luck Dink. And do let us know how things are going. xxxx Likewise Shiela, and news on the job front. Good jobs worldwide are rare as hen's teeth. And those in work are having their rights eroded and thier wages effectively cut which benefits are slashed. My niece's boyfriend is a Graduate Teacher who is doing supply work (and that is being cut) She is really lucky as she has been given a contract, but she is the only one of her class who has securiy. I am dispairing of the futuree. Me, I've been feeling low since Sharon died - it could so easily have been me, and she had so very much to live for. When she was dyinbg, it was over in weeks. She was in bandages from head to toe latterly as the cancer spread to her skin. She inspired me so much as out dx and treatment was the same, so she was 3 months ahead of me and never failed to keep me going. She only lived 5 miles from me, so we all met up at least acouple of times a month. One time, when I finished FEC, and got great results, tumour shrank so much that a lumptectomy, feeling on top of the world, Sharon had finiished all her chemo, had her mx and recon done (simiultaneously) and we felt the future was golden. We went to The Mussel Inn (where I took Devin when he was over) (Was advised again shellfish during chemo) We had loads of wine (which I couldn't stand during FEC) We were so happy thinking the worst was behind us. Sorry feeling weepy. Anyhoo, do keep the thread going. Only we know what it's like, eh? Love and hugs and lollipops Nettie xxx",

Because of Shuggies prevailing op, the fact that I was there on my other brother's 5th anniversary, who died a few hundred yards away, well it was like the perfect storm.

I am so proud of you for having the balls to see the situation in the round and not giving in to their manipulating torture. When this reach a crisis point, then the authorities will HAVE to act. I would, in your position, contact you local political representative to let him know of the brick walls you are faced with. It is NOT your responsibiliy to bail out your useless daughter and the creep (oh yes, I did have a brief look at his online actrivity (status \"divorced\" or \"single\", no children - then he refers to them in his posts - IDIOT!!!, ) AManda was the usually gushy \"I luv u soooooooo much etc. Pass the sickbag. i could help it Cathi - I posted \"why do you communicate in this chilish way?????\"  My 13 year old niece posts like this ........ So what if they are going to be homeless. They are both adults, in employment and useless at finances, parenting and life. But no one owes them any favours Cathi.What they have put you, their kids and darling Ed through is unforgivable. I will do my best to let all of his 'friends' know what a worthless piece of crap he is. Amanda needs a good beating too. She might conme to her senses in a shelter, might get some support from other women why didn't have such a loving family to misuse. Thinking of you always and praying for an end to your troubles. xxxxxxxx Well, hospital next week, so a bit nervous. I get 6 monthly checkups because my cancer was so aggresive. I am on new ashma meds too as I have ha a couple of scary episodes lately. Seem to be helping though. Also the diverticular prob is quite troublesome at the moment. Kerry and Lillly Rose are coming up for a fortnight in a couple of weeks (cannie wait!) Lilly is thriving like a wee sprout and \"talks\" on the phone!!!! Amy crawled for the first time today!!!! marie (her mum) is in tears. Because of her health problems,her progress is slower than normal (and Lilly is quite advanced for her age, so stark contrast) But she is so adored and contented and funny. ANd another bit of good news - Marie is nearly 4 months pregnant - and everything is going wonderfully! She had 8 miscrriages before Amy, but she had a blood disorder that is correctable by daily injections. So Amy will have a wee playmate in December. Got  bunch of new pics that I will post. Now girls for th bad news. I need, need, need your prayers and positive vibes. My wee brother was told today that he has a tumour in the bladder. He went in for a regular physical and mentioned faint traes of blood in his urine (no pain or discomfort and very slight) We don't know yet if it malignant or thetreatment plan so it's the limbo stage. I am ging to England tomorrow, but have to be back for my meeting with my onc. He is a young, heaalthy fitness freak (he has to be -he has custody of his 2 daughters, one of whom is severely autistic) so out of the 4 sibling, 3 of us have been affected by cancer. My older brother died of it. My poor sister is inconsolable. We don't know why this horrible dsease has blighted our family. We have done nothing to deserve it!!! Sorry, feeling very weepy. My brother and i are EXTREMELY close, always have been. The darlin took me to Ireland for a fantastic holiday after my surgery, we had a grand time but it cost him a fortune. Please say a prayer for him, girls. Will keep you posted as we find out more. Sorry for the downer, but we are keeping this under wraps in the meantime as Hugh does not want to alarm anyone till we know more (I remeber the exact feeling) So tis is cthartic. Well trying to catch a bit of sleep as the journey will be tiring. Arrngments made for the cats. Speak soon. Stay strong and thank you al for being there.

Like so many others, I have lost both my parents (it's my mum's 21s anniversary on Sat - she  died very young) My sis, auntie (her wee sister) my neice and I are going to ''visit' mum and dad on Friday after my last chemo tomorrow. I'm planting a lovely planter with a beautiful white shrub with white flowers,  some violas and my hollyhocks this pm, when my nephew arrives, to do the heavy lifting. We take a gin and tonic for mum and a guiness for dad and pour it on the graves have a good laugh and chat with them, keep them up to date, then lunch. With cocktails! When dad died, quite suddenly with septecemia following a totally routine procedure he was delirious for 2 days and then came back to us - the dozens who took over the hospital in England!! When he passes we, his 4 children, my dearest cousin, with whom I am staying when I visit Blackpool for the weekend, my neice (then 14, but insisted on not leaving his bedside) and the priest were all there and it was a beautiful, spiritual experience. I actually take comfort in it as it would have been his perfect passing. So I echo the thought that your dad might choose to leave this world surrounded by all of the people who he loved most, peacefully, full of love and fearless of death. God bless you and your family Nancy - sorry, having a wee 'greet' (cry) at the moment. Love to you all. Cathi - the assicons are GENIOUS, what would we do without you? Just remember that ignorance, like your foul friends, is to be pitied. Someday something might just rock her old boat - not that we would wish it on her ....... Love you all guys.

When I saw the great big beast living in my breast shrunk from 5cm to 16 mm I cried all that night, and I didn't cry during treatment. Thye feeling of beating bootface is overwhelming, isn't it? Sorry you can't make it up to Scotland this trip, would have loved to show you round Glasgow. It's a fabulous city. Maybe next time. I know you had a really tight schedule. I as seeing my Onc consultant on Thur, hope he concurs with the breast surgeon about my prognosis. Still having to face rads and a year on intaveneous Herceptrin for a year. Girls, can you advise me - I don't know what has come over me the past few days. I feel overcome with a feeling of doom and helplessness. Maybe it's an anti-climax. All of my circle are so relieved about my progress ..... and I just feel like someone has pulled the plug on me. I am more tired that I was on chemo, literally have to summon the energy to vacuum or shower or anything!!!!. I was told by everyone that neo- adv takes a long time to recover from but I am getting really impatient with myself. My cousin is visiting for a long weekend and I should be really happy as he is one of my favourite people on the planet. He has popped out for a pint with his childhood buddies and I am sitting here fighting back tears. I will try the mega dose of vitamin B12, I am a veggie, so need my B vitamins boosted anyway. I feel life has become pretty joyless, nothing is giving me pleasure. I cannot share these feelings with anyone so forgive me. I hate self pity. Money worries don't help and I will have to think about finding a new job soon, except that my energy is non existant and my confidence is shattered. Is this normal? Sorry ignore all the above. I should be happy that I have been put on the road to restored health. Going to have a nice hot shower, than settling down with Sunday papers. Sorry for being self indulgent girls. Good to get it off my chest.!! Talking of which, I don't even think I will need any recon. The scar is ugly but the flesh is just dimpled. Might still be post op swelling, but no real dent. I had to have the wound of the lymph removal drained a couple of times, but I am healing well. JUST TIRED!!! And SICK of it! I can't even enjoy our unusually lovely weather as it is exhausting me. I am getting a new wig tomorrow! That might cheer me up as my old one is beginning to look tatty. My hair has started to grow back, but colourless and feels more like fur on a puppy's tummy tan hair. I'll get it shaved tomorrow. I am having to pluck my brows daily, and my lashes are back albeit shorter than before Thanks for letting me rant. I feel like an ungrateful cow!!!!! As always, love you lots like jellytots!!! Nettie xxx",

So we share empathy that's not patronising or misguide, or embarrsed. I feel strangely ok now. I was told by my the Oncies nurses that I might get 2 more courses of Tax (they KNOW their stuff) so I was expecting it, then the results of the histology of he tumour was soooo good. I think I was expecting the ax to fall and that was why I was so weepy after my good news. Thinking \"it can't be THAT easy, Netts, not with your luck!\" I had the Consultant, Mr Yusef laughing. He is Egyptian, quite old and a genius (he was honoured by the Queen), but is quite shy and unsmiling. Well before he introduced me to his young colleague who will he taking over my case I asked to be introduced to his grandson. He laughed out loud, which Angela the BC nurse who was in with me, said she hadn't seen often, and rarely in a consultation. I just asked for the lads skin care routine cos he looked like he should be in primary school. It just seems 4 courses when I don't have cancer in me seems a lot, especially getting Herceprin the day before. Of our group here in Scotland, there only 3 of us who are HER2 +, so no one here has had this kind of tharapy! Can any one out there help? They might stop at 2 courses, depending on how I tolerate it, so I have to keep a close diary of s/e, as some of them might become permanent.I think that's why Martin, my bestest oncy, told me to prepare myself for 2 sessions of \"the yew tree poison\". That kind of freaked me out!! What s/e might become permanent??? They reckon the cancer was only about a year old and grew so fast and wasn't 'hard', except round the edges, so difficult to detect by touch. Anyway, I think they recommend 4 courses as an ideal and I will try to take all 4. I don't understand why the Herceptrin is concurrent as the protocol is for 18 courses 3 weeks apart after chemo and rads. So I think I will have to have another 18 after rads as that seems to be the norm. Anyway, I literally trust Mr Yusef with my life. Literally!! Feel more positive now there is another challenge. At least now, I cannot be turned down for DLA, (surely!!) which will be a huge weight of the finances. Some other bits of good news. My new Irish jig is lovely, really natural and exactly like a designer cut I had years ago, for which I paid a fortune (I uses to work for an oil company in the Shetland Isles) so spending was no biggie .... back then! Anyway, I am really pleased with it, though I love having a cool shower, putting on a lovely cotton nightie ( I have bought some really nice ones, can easily wear them to answer the door) and putting on a terry towelling head wrap to chill out after a sticky day. Adrinna, the fitter, shaved off the 'bum fluff' hair on Monday and I have had real hair growing back already (I look like a Naxi)! I will lose it again, of course, but hay ho. the worst of all these things has already happened! OH lots of silver there where there wasn't before, proof that chemo DOES age you!!! Going to lose my lashes again - boo hoo, they were just looking nice, and my nails. They're horrible just now, but haven't fallen off! AND my beautiful Dell pink rubberised laptop is fixed. Hurrah!!! And it only cost £10, not the £316 I was quoted elsewhere!! I love that machine more that an inanimate thing has the right to be loved!!! It just needed cleaning of the bloody lemonade and the motherboard tightened. I promise I will never let anyone hurt it again. They will have to wear gloves it they touch it, under close supervision! My wonderful brother Hugh had it repaired for me. I was going down to Blackpool today for a break before I am back on the treadmill, but was pretty sick yesterday, so will go tomorrow. Need to get all my dental work done before 31st when it all starts again, we were going to stagger it over 3 visits. Wow! chemo really damages the teeth, minor damage certainly, but I need a veneer as my root canal work has discoloured. I paid £190 last year to have it internally whitened, which worked too. So that's the news from the front gals. Feeling quite positive. Always do for challenges and I know this is the best chance of beating this bugger stone dead and THAT'S motivational. I am a stubborn bugger. AE, how is UB, responding to treatment? Thank god they got it early. Reassure us! Sue, Aloe Vera is wonderful for any kind of burn. I have a huge Aloe Vera plant and also a 500ml tube living in my fridge constantly. It's dead cheap and pure 99.9% pure - only £4.99 from Holland and Barrett. Makes a lovely skin moisturiser too, Great as an after sun. But if your burn doesn't respond, you have got to go to A & E if it is on your 'at risk' arm. I was given 2 big leaflets from the hosp when I had surgery. 1 in 3 of us who had lymph removal will get lympheodema and injuries to the at risk arm are not to be dismissed.They might be serious. Please seek help!!! Mel, what a horrible time you have had. What a spiteful, vindictive thing for that arse to do. OK, maybe he got tired storing your stuff, but he could have been decent, explained that to you and given you notice to make other arrangments!!! (Sorry! I sneaked 'arse' through customs!) Where are you staying now? It must be scary not having a roof over your head, tho' it sounds like you have good support, if not space for stuff. Money worries suck too. I am not a breadhead, never worshipped money, but when there is more going out than coming in ......stress on a new level.Your outlook, though, is inspirational. You sound like you have the most wonderful son. Lucky old you. Family can see you through ANY troubles. There isn't a day that I take my family for granted for what they have done to support me through all this. Judie!!!!!! Dinnae! I gasped at your comment too.Had to re-read it twice. Funny, I developed a wee purple frekle (sp) on my boob, right over the tumour. Doc said it was nothing to worry about! Maybe is wasn't. Pretty colour it is. Cathi, my next door neighbour and her partner were separated, but amicable enough. One Sunday afternoon he called round to see the kids with his mum and sister, he was really pleasant to me as I was leaving the house to pick up the Sundays, and by the time I got back, 2 cars were screeching away from the house, I was just across the road so didn't see anything but heard raised voices. It took about 15 minutes as the shop is just down the road. Later that evening 2 policemen came to my door to see if I saw or heard anything. I tried to be helpful but didn't see anything at all, and only saw Peter knocking the door, and saw the cars driving away at speed. He had done to Joanne what your SIN did to Jacklyn. Jo was out of the house for 2 weeks and I was worried sick. The house was just empty. She came home after 2 weeks a wreck, terrified of her own shadow. She looked ok by then (she used Arnica gel on the bruising), but they had taken pics and OMG she was black and blue. She too, had thumb marks on her neck,split lip etc and she got the police at once. She had met someone else (who now living with her and they are very happy) The red mist just decended on Peter, her ex. Ironic, as had lots of affairs and he left Jo!) The case went to trial. I was initially called, but because I could contribute anything, was let off testifying. He was found 'not proven' - a weird Scottish verdict that means they knew he was guilty but couldn't prove it as there were no witnesses (rational was that it could have been the mum or the sister - they just knew she had been assaulted, and they claimed it was just a fight, not an assault) I always felt that if I just said I heard her screaming or saw something .... that might have made the difference.The kids heard it all, but the court would not accept their testimony as Jo might have \"groomed\" them. I have always felt a bit guilty for not backing her up be saying I saw something. But that would have been perjury. Anyway the upshot is the he can only see the kids under supervision and they don't want anything to do with him (and HE was a devoted dad, especially to Louis). Jo is with a lovely guy now who is great to the kids (and to me - they can't do enough for me since my dx) So there is hope for the future. Just make sure that he fulfils his financial responsibility to them. Your pic was great, we just don't/can't get enough photos of Margot and the kids. How is Jacklyn doing? Poor lass, she hasn't had to seek her troubles, has she? She has got a great mum though, and I'll bet the house she knows it! Has your other daughter and her Horrible Hubby decended on you yet? Lay down the rules! It's much better if people know their boundries, including putting money in the pot! Long term guests are not cheap!! Ivorymom, Lynda, Jane and all of you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support. All of my family and friends thank you for your support as you guys fulfil a role THAT NOBOBY ELSE can!! With all my love Nettie the invincable (lol) XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",

I'm exhausted by the time I get home. and I have got his till the beginning of next year. Off Friday as the equipment is being serviced, so I can take my wonderful family for lunch to a fabulous Tapas restaurant called Cafe Andeluz, and get all the business things I need to get done in the morning. Rads seem ok thus far - though I am already feeling a bit hot in the boob already. I am very, very white skinned. I was a bit freaked out when they told me to cream my back as the rays can pass through the body at the collerbone. Brought it home that it is a risky old process! So lovely to read about your life and times. I am still very tired and pretty sore today, very achey and sometimes think this will never be over and the fact that you have all got on with your lives fills me  with hope, it's great sharing experiences; hopes and fears. I am very worrried about Cathi though, what you have been through this year!! What were your scan results?  Like everyone else, I am praying for Amanda and baby Ella (I had a wonderful auntie called Ella, so she is named after one of the most wonderful ladies I have even known) How is Jacklyn? And NEED some more pics of uber cutie Margo. And your beautiful grandkids. They really are beautiful and the camera just loves them. Lisa, I love your attitude!!! I wish I was more like you. Play the field and don't let any of them play with your feelings!! Remember that they are nothing more than a sub species with a few uses. Anyway, enjoy your life to the absolute full. Normal service in the old waste disposal department slowly returning to normal, but I still need the banding op done when all the rads are out of the way. Can't believe how feeble I still am. Now that TAX is finished, I am developing the swollen ankles, the hair came out last weekand the nails are going to fall off. They are VERY painful now and coming up \"bruised\" Looks like I have caught them in a car door. Weird or what? And the achyness? I bounced back so quickly after FEC!!! TAX just about did me in, to be honest. I'm proud that I persevered. It was soooooo hard, but I thought I would be getting better by now ....... Been over a months since last chemo. Anyway, moan over. Christmas is coming - got all my presents online, some bargains too, so that's taken care of. Thank God for QVC!!! Signing off for now - wish me luck for the rest of me being fried! Love, love and more of it Nettie xxxxx ",

Just been to the Burns Supper at the same hotel I was sick in last Monday! They do everything with a 'modern Scottish twist' and this is the first Burns Night they have hosted (The parkville was refurbished under new management as of last year) Food was brill!. Cockaleechie soup (light chicken broth with rice, veg and prunes) haggis (natch) with tatties and champed neeps (yellow turnip mashed to within an inch of it's life) and cranachan to follow. That's toasted oatflakes with honey, cream and fresh raspberries. All ridiculously traditional and very, very nice. They piped in the haggis (a piper preceeds the guys bearing the haggis)  All by candlelight and all very theatrical! If you have never tried haggis, please try. It is delicious.Just don't ask what's in it!!! But I get the vegggie one anyway. I had a half (pensioner's) portion of all 3 courses and enjoyed every mouthful, thank god! Had a couple - or 3 - of Talisker's Single Malt too!! Very dark,smoky, peaty malt from Skye. I have been to the distillery on Skye so have great respect for the way the Islanders produce (and revere!) the Malt.And it tastes great, even if I don't drink it often. It's like eggnog (Advoccat) I love it at Christmas and Hogmany, but never have it any other time ... Nancy, all the VERY best with your op. Just imagine waking up with loud and proud boobies!!! It will be the full stop on your cancer adventure. You will have a ball shopping for saucy bras I'll wager?? Incidentally, I strayed into the hair thread for the first time the other day - and there was our dear Nancy and her 'return of the hair story' Complete with all of the trepidation and experiments and shared experiences. Looks like, from my brief read, that my own hair is following the same path, and about the same rate as many on the thread, which was VERY reassuring. Even the fact that it fell out after chemo, as no one I know personally had that particular experience. Anyoldhow, be thinking  of you and sending positive vibes your way. Post a pic of your new decolette when you're ready. Must learn how to post pics myself .... Poor sis is still bedbound, she hit her face and head on her descent and has black eyes and a cut lip. She kind of tumbled down front and back, so is sore all over. My BIL is working from home to tend to her for the next fortnight, he will be able to attend local meetings etc, but much of his work can be conducted from home. He is quite senior in the Civil Service supporting The Scottish Government, and they have been great with him. He broke his knee last year and worked from home for 6 weeks until it knitted together. Meant he didn't have to go on sick and saved them a lot of hassle trying to get cover for him as his role is quite specialised. It worked out fine, so they had no hesitation about letting him do it to care for Moira. SHe needs help getting in and out of bed, bathing etc She is on 2 types of poweful painkillers and muscle relaxants and it will just take time to heal. Definitly no bones broken, which is a miracle. But she looks like she has been in the wars. She was home alone too, just taking the rubbish bin out. She managed to avoid falling during our 7 weeks of SUB ZERO TUNDRA and feels stupid falling so badly when there was no ostensible reason. The kids have been great, really stepped up to the plate. I made some Tomato and Basil soup as she has little appetite and that is a very delicate soup. Might make some lentil soup tonight for us, my nephew (her eldest) is coming up tomorrow to  help me shop, tidy the garden etc and he can take a big pot back home. My neighbour, Willie has a great crop of leeks and gave me a bunch of big, fat beauties!. I planted tatties in big containers last Autumn (few days before staring TAX, brought some seed tatties back from Ireland) and they are cropping very well too, so lots of nice homegrown veg.... Will make Leek and Potato soup too I think. Love soup, so terribly easy to make and warming and comforting don't you find? Oh Film about to start. Hope you all had a lovely day. Speak soon ..

I left my phone and spex at my sister's yesterday and SHE DROVE UP TODAY as she was worried that I needed them. Big sunglasses and a snood for disguise - she looked like a paperazzi dodger! Her husband and kids are driving her mad fussing around and she needed to escape. We are sooooo alike.  I gave her hell as she is not fit to drive though. We were comparing bruising, mines are fading and hers are just beginning to bloom. What a pair we make. Karen, I finally opened  the link to your new home open. What a pleasure it was to hear your voice and the house looks just amazing. So much space. I wish you all the luck in the world when you move into it. Have you sold your old house? I felt overwhelmed with grief/foreboding/helplessness this afternoon. Had a good old weep. It came out of the blue (though I am throwing up an awful lot still and know that there is still a lot to come) I feel vaguly ashamed as I know how lucky I am but all of the lingering nonsence and the changes this B******D disease has done to me don't seem to be getting any better. What a wimp I am! I am going down to Blackpool after Herceprtin on Monday for a few days. Get some sea air and catch up with mates and family. Need to shake off this funk before then tho'. I am hoping to start swimming soon, once I get the nod from the onc. They will provide a physio to retrain me (and my sis) as I have limited movement now in both arms. It will be nice to start building up gently. I didn't read any of Watson's posts, but it is so awful when one of us succumbs to this stinking thing. So very, very scary too. The Wicker Man was dreadful, by the way, so I just went back to the pub after 30 minutes!! It was a great evening. Do you have Burn's Night in the US? It's a good excuse for sentimental indulgence and most folk here celebrate it.I've got a great big veggie haggis in the fridge as we speak. Wish I had an appetite to enjoy it! Girls, thanx as always for being there. Love you all heaps.   Nettie xxx",

Tweedledum and Tweedledumer. He's limping badly and in a state of shock. He's quiet - and he is a noisy cat (even talks in his sleep - so funny), but he's had a bit of tuna and it'll be the vets first thing tomorrow morning. I am crying with relief and hope he hasn't broken his leg.  Thank you all, I am sure that, as Judie said, you prayed him home. He's grounded forever natch! Nancy, so relieved that you checked in. Sorry you are in pain, but that was a marathon operation session. I had an op to repair my shoulder that lasted 5 1/2  hours and I thought THAT was bad. I learned a really good technique for coping with pain. Get a great memory foam mattress, then get youself into a pain free position by 'moving away' fraction by fraction from the pain site then breath very deeply and don't move a muscle. I would wake up because I was stiff rather than in pain. Try it. I used the same techniques during my surgeries last year. How wonderful that you now have boobs again. I see a BIG shop in your near future ...... My dears, I can't wait to let everyone know about my wee cat and to get him checked out. No sleep for Nettie tonight ... Oh can I ask for a bit of advice? I am still really, really fatigues and throwing up a lot. Should I ask my onci for a short course of Dex steroids? They made me feel great during Tax. Anything to get me back to normal (I know, the 'new' normal) Love you guys. Tons Nettie xxxxx",

I probably mis-explained the pain control technique. It was \"taught\" to me by a chiropractor when I ruptured the disc at the base of my spine. I suppose it's s type of meditation, but it works for me (and helped my sis when she had that hellish fall. She's well on the mend BTW. Arnica and arnica bath soaks have helped. That and the reflexology and Indian Head massages she gets twice weekly) First things is a really comfortable surface. Then very deep breathing while you mentally locate the source of the pain, or the worst site of the pain. Then you move - physically move - minutely away from it. Kinda like the micromovements you get done to you at rads. You will find that the pain goes or 'cools down'. Keep breathing really deeply and slowly counting or chanting (like praying) mentally. Don't laugh but I mentally recitied the Hail Mary! Like we did when we learned it by rote when we were infants. Got to number 2 or 3 and I was asleep. After about 2 hours, I woke up (bit stiff) got up, rearraged my pillows (I was too much in pain to turn in my sleep) and repeated the process. Sorry if this is vague Nancy, but pain killers don't do well with me (I was always scared in case I was sick in my sleep) and I found this to be more effective.  Sis did the whole process listening to a buddist mediation tape. It also works if you find a bath helpful as long as you bath is shallow. God bless on your recovery. Thank god cost is not an issue here for treatment, even the cosmetic part of the whole thing. I might need to have the \"good boob\" -the one that didn't try to kill me reduced, as her naughty sister might shrink due to the amount of rads. Looking down at my cleavage, the damage doesn't seem too bad, a wee crater the size of a big walnut. Seems almost trivial considering .... but I will get the recon. I do hope that you are not faced with huge costs. Surely if more treatment was needed than oriiginally anticiated that is not your fault and your insurance should meet it? Mind you, when I have needed to claim insurance (once for a flood to my home and once for a bag which was stolen) I was taken aback that my very comprehensive insurance has exclusions.... Best of luck sweetie! And it will be worth it. Take care Nancy, so relieved you are feeling well enough to keep in touch. Hugs and stuff to EVERYONE and have a great weekend.  xxxxNettiexxxxx",

Next time, my niece will tag alone to show him the town from a youth perspective. She couldn't last time as her big sis had a hellish kindney infection and my sis was on holiday in the Lake District (now there'e a beautiful part of the country) So wee Carol went to Dundee to be with her (Theresa's boyfriend, a fellow teacher) was away at a golf tournament, so she felt very alone and sorry for herself. That's the 3rd time she has had a kidney infection. Hope it's not going to plague her, such a wretched condition. Anyway, I feel like I have known the laddie all his life! I do know what you mean though about the unexpected benefits of Cancer. I have met so many wonderful people, fellow travellers with cancer, and we are all now the firmest of friends, meet for lunch, drinks etc often (at least every fortnight) Meeting you guys (no, at one point DEPENDING on you guys) has been a privilege. Not to mention the guys at Maggie's Centre, the wonderful oncies at Hairmyres, the volunteer drivers etc etc have been a honour to meet. I would love it if any of you could make your way over here, here's hoping .... Hosp toomorrow for Herceptrin (and I am not bothered, in fact be nice to see everyone) Had the barium enema done last Wednesday - nothing like as bad I imagined. I have been prescribed Buscopan for the spasms and seems to be working well. i am getting stronger, just the legs find it difficult going uphill, but will be getting phsio for that, and swimming therapy from week after next. Be great to be mobile again and shift the bloody chemo weight! I love you all very much, am on facebook - albeit very tentatively! The babies are just beautiful, real wee miracles. Please spare a prayer for wee Amy though, as she will need a lot of reconstructive work done on her wee ear. Mind you, she has sooooo much beautiful black hair that it almost covers it.

Your Child care system is incomprehensible to be (mind you, there have been horrible cases of abuse here - but i can't think of one where children were plucked from a loving family home to be returned, experimentally, to a home where such abuse happened).  I hope they have a proper stratergy. I am still annoyed at Amanda and her worthless husband, and sympathise with Jaqulyn's position) Sorry. Re the \"back up\"; mother of god - I know what you mean. Since last year, and the divericulitis dx, I have had nary a day when I have not been in pain. With me, it feels like I have damaged my hip bone. Surgery is the only solution, but I will have to wait some time to ensure I am up for the op - getting 2 medicals in Jan (12th and 15th) It's such an embaressing thing to discuss too, donche think? It has been lovely to catch up with you all. Hope Christamas passed peacefully an that 2011  is going to be happy, peaceful and prosperous - Shiela - FINGERS XXX for the job Netz xx",

It DOES sound that they are making an efffort, and being wary of letting you see Ella's bruise indicates to me that they are being careful. They know that they are on probation. You just take the time off babysitting to take care of yourself and Ed. And the pets! Love you Cathi, and fingers firmly crossed! Nanci, many congratulations on your new home, and loving the story about the pup. When I was a kid we had the lovliest English Sringer Spaniel who was a total gannet. Once she managed to get into the fridge, make off with the VERY expensive Sunday roast. My wee mum thought she was going do-lally pip when she went to prepare dinner. We found the remains in her dog basket, and not much of them either. My brother's dog Kiki discovered 3 boxes of chocolate liquers underneath the Xmas tress. Brother got up at 7am Xmas morning to start preparation, slipped in a big puddle of sick - went flying across the bedroom - and then had to cope with a very hungover pup. Seems like even the best behaved animals don't pass up on an opportunity to fill their guts! New Year hear was much quieter than usual, because we have all been ill too!!! (HOW do these bugs get around) I was ace over New years eve and New Years day - about the only one who was then -SLAP BANG WALLOP, yesterday I thought I was dying. No exaggeration, temp was 40 degrees, through the ceiling! -  projectile heaving never seen since the Exorcist and God, the worst headache I have ever had. And we are totally shut down because of the holidays. Temp is now 37.5/38 so a lot better. My next door neighbour has been looking after cats, feeding them and changing litter.  Otherwise poor mites would have been neglected badly. I was dx 2 years ago tomorrow, I was healthy then. The long term s/e do get me down. Just seems that when I get anything, everything kicks in, gagging, coughing, spasms. And the muscle weakness is restricting. Oh well my lovelies, again Happiest of New Starts to us all. Netz xxxxx",

Snow has returned so having a lazy day, watching the box and catching up on facebook etc. Dancing on Ice has just started it's new series and I just LOVE it. Very nervous girls. I have a Medical Assessment to determine if I am fit for work (I so am not) but it's been hived out to a very dodgy VERY MUCH FOR PROFIT American outfit called ATOS, the assessors for which don't even have to be DOCTORS!!!!!   It's all put in to dicredited software called LiMA. 7 out of 10 people are rejected (70% are passed on appeal, so it is costly and a waste of time). VERY,VERY angry, as is the Citizens Advice Board, all charities, Cancer, Athritis etc. It is costing an unholy amount to fund these shysters. ANyway, I am going in with my sister (who is probably more qualified medically than the assessor) a dictaphone (which I will buy tomorrow) and some very tough questions that I will be putting to the 'Doctor' This is so alien to our ethos and principles. I am contacting my MP, MSP and MEP (all our representatives) about this outrage. It is costing US almost £1b per annum - to a private and unethical company. I have decided that I am going to enjoy this, and will do everything I can to destroy them and replace them with a proper, medically trained and PUBLICALLY owned system of assessment who have no vested interest in putting seriously ill people (they call us 'customers!') though this torment - for bonuses!. ANyhow, they haave taken on a tough nut with me. I will make the cretin who tries the psychological routine on me fell likethe maggot they seem to be. I have read the most damning inditments today. Also have my first appointment with my breast surgeon since I finished rads this time last year on Friday, so please say a prayer. Boob is still hot and bit sore, fells like there is cardboard under the skin and still a bit swollen, so we'll see what he says. God knows when I'll be able to get recon. Sorry for the rant. I just cannot believe the tactics these crooks get up to. Judges have declared that some reports \"are nonsensical\" The amount of stuff on the net is astounding and totally disgusting, I find it hard to believe this is the UK. For example if you can walk up 2 stairs using a handrail, you are deemed fit for work. One chap had in his notes \"he can make tea and tend to his goldfish\" So fighting fit then! Another woman says she \"pottered about\" and this morphed into \"she does pottery all day\" These are from the cases the Judge says are \"nonsensical\" There are loads of them. We do need fore MEDICAL ASSESSMENTS - by SUITABLY QUALIFIED medical staff. So ANGRY. This has to stop. Nets is on the case. Thanks girls - feel better now. Wish me luck for both hells next week!

I know it's not quite the same, but I had a similar experience with my deceased brother (who was also my next door neighbour) Charles was a very high earner all his life - he bloody raced through the ranks of the Civil Service - and was spoilt all of his life by the family. He had poliomylitis as a toddler and there was nothing denied him. To cut a VERY long story short, he set up his own training company,  with money left to him by my grannie and the rug was pulled from under him by the Thatcher government. They got most of the funding from central government,  and their funding body was dissolved. Actually, a kind of similar thing happened to the charity I ran. Anyhow, from being a high earning director, he was bankrupted overnight. He paid all his creditors and wages outstanding. He kept all of this secret for months, and was borrowing off everyone - me a lot. It was sometimes high amounts - £1000, till his pension came through (he got a handsome pension from the Civil Service) The money was never repaid, of course. He was, as we say here \"on the bones of his arse\". In debt to his armpits. But because he had never not had money,he was always asking for it. To me, my brother, my auntie .. Eventually, I did a double shop on Friday. Bought staples - washing up liquid, loo paper, bleach, beans, tinned fish, fruit, tea, milk, cat food and litter, some frozen meals etc. Because if I gave him £20 he would spend it on cigaretts (which killed him) or a few pints at the local pub. He told me when he was sinking that he meant to thank me more, but was so angry that his financial decline consumed him. Sorry, feeling a bit weepy. But you did what I did Cathi. Provided the basics to allow them to live, and support them. Charles used to say that buying these things was partonising, I said I wasn't going to work to pay for his beer and cigs (which are - thank god - extremely expensive here)  I thought I was doing the right thing. I know I did. And so did you Cathi. I can't believe I have just expressed this! Will have to post it before I erase it. Thanks girls (and Ed) - well done Cathi. Nets xx ",

I still have a full head of black hair and to be honest, I can't image not having it.  I have bought my scarves and hats etc, but I don' t think anything is really registering. My weapon to the world is to be nonchoclant and dismissive of this thing but I am shaken to the core. I thought that I was so organised but I know that I am totally unprepared.  Be damned if I let anyone know however. How painful is lymph biopsy? I don't know what to expect on Thur, so I am trying to do everything in anticipation, my wee house is sparkling clean!!!! I do wish I could sleep, might get some knockout pills from the doc. Oh God what a misery guts you guys must think I am - and I'm so not. I am just scared shitless and as the treatment schedule nears I am in terror. But there is no way I will show it, it's just not me. And if I react in public, it will make it all too real and upset my family. Is it ok to be around your animals during chemo? I have three wee cats who stick to me like glue - they sleep on TOP of me in rotation. It's cathartic being able to unload, and I do hope I'm not boring or depressing you guys. It's so cold here, we get cold in Scotland but this is unprecedented - it hit zero in Aviemore today - a beautiful wee ski resort village in the Cairngorm mountains today (I used to live there, incidentally) and we are under a foot of snow here. A lot of the schools are closed and transport is unpredicable. All this and we are in the grip of a recession. Talk about everything coming together at once. My sweet sisters, I will now try to grap a few zzzzs. Will let you know how went the biopsy later on in the week - do you think I will get the path results on the day? I think I will, after all I had the mammo, ultrasound biopsy and result with 2 hours on the day I was dx And I have just spotted a job in Glasgow that is perfect for me and highly paid and I won't be able to apply for it!

I feel I am losing it - don't wan't to be smothered and I am also upset that not enough is being done for me. I think some of it goes back to when My brother Charles was diagnosed with terminal cancer of the gullet, and I wanted to do EVERYTHING for him. And did. He was my next door neighbour and was recenty divorced so I was there 24/7. I also had to have my shoulder operated on - I had a horrible falll in Dec 2003 and , me being me, didn't even go to the hosp that day. I went the next day when there was too much swelling and soft tissue damage to get a proper x-ray, so they didn;t realise that I had a torn rotator cuff, ruptured tendon on the shoulder has come out of the socket. Also a shard of bone was pressing into the nerve and, boy that pain was a hoot. Got the op to repair the damage in June 2006 and it was a big operation. I had to learn to move - the socket had dried up the same a a deoderant with the cap left off.  So I have done the spider up the wall and crawling my fingers across a table with this injury.  The nurse who did the pre op assessment told me that this willbe a walk in the park compared to the shoulder injury. Where is this park they keep referring to,by the way??? A great friend came up from Blackpool, in England (where lots of my family and friends live) to take care of us both  and Charles died(quite horrible) on July 13th 2006 The experience was one of hte worst of my life and the lives my family. So I know that I might be overreacting to all of this that's happening to me. Also was made redundant on Jan 3rd. I live alone too, so I have real money concerns, though I think I have sorted that out. But all the news I have had of late has made me fear for the future. When the machine broke down, I just though f&^% it, ordered a top of the range one, a new T.V and a fire and surround.  I was planning to get these things when I found a new job (I bought a TV from ASDA -WallMart and it is still under guareentee, but the sound is awful and it is a CRT - I only bought it as a stopgap!) How terribly irresponsible of me! So unlike me, too! My wee cats - my wee furry purry angels, rarely use the litter tray, they attend to their needs outdoors and the tray is just contingency.  It's just that in the notes form the hospital says to avoid contact with animals during chemo, but all of you wonderful gals seem to be mad animal lovers too, so is the hosp just being overcautious?? They cry and scratch at the bedroom door if I try to lock them out, and anyway, the sound of them purring send me to sleep. Sleep - I can't - I slept all Sat, relief that the CAT scan on Friday was such a breeze I suppose. But I havent since. Really havent slept for more than a couple of hours.Trying to see the doc toda today - it's 6am exacty here in Scotland for some knockout drops. I actually feel hyper, maybe because there seems so much to do before I start treatment. Got to reappoint for the wig, see the Occupational Therapist to have home aids installed (handgrips for the bath etc, and my shower is on it's last legs, so they might install a new one)  I used to be the Co-Ordinator of a Charity, Crossroads Care Attendant Scheme and I used to arrange all of this for our clients.  That was some time ago, and there have been so very many changes (for the worse) in Social Care provision. I have had no help - in fact I have been misadvised by the Social Worker from McMillan Cancer. She didn't seem to know that Cancer patients automatically go on the higher rate of support, and that piece of info is on THE McMILLAN HOMEPAGE. It's a difference of £29 p/w - still derisory but it is money that as a lifelong taxpayer I am entitled to.  The incompetance to which I have been subjected has been breathtaking. When I feel better, that little lady wll be brought to book!!!!!! All this, soaring energy bills (I have been charged £100 a month for electricity alone) extreme weather conditins - it actually fell to ZERO in the Highlands and you might get an idea why I am feeling low. But anyway, I will get all that sorted. I ma a highly competant person. I just shouldn't have to do all this when I have had this bombshell. WOW - feel better now. You are my cyberangels - I have spilled more here than I have ever done in my life. EVER. Nonaoften - do you have 10 grandchildren? Lucky you! Yes, when i got my diangosis, I did a big cancer shop, Hats, scarves (I have never used them so bought htem in preparation.  Actually quite comforting in this weather. Bought Nightwear, slippers (I am a Birkenstock, Scholl  chick. Do you have those in the US?) But I bought furry, granny slippers coz sometimes your feet get sore. Bought thermometer and blood pressure moniter, anticeptic  lozengers, loads of ginger stuff - love them anyway, tee tree wash - great after my shoulder surgery and Arnica (ditto) multivitamens, a smoothie maker in case I can't eat during chemo, nausea bands, got anti-emetic from the doc - I couldn't stop being sick at the time got antidepressants, got my filling done, aloe vera to soothe for the rads, lots of heb teas (which I love anyway) miluka honey. Cost an absolute fortune!!!! Nana - I got my hair cut really short, I quite like it actually! Havent told Will, my hairdresser yet, but would you believe it ... when I was there a wee girl, 10 or 11 I think, who was donating her beautiful waist lenght blond hair!! Apparently, there's a campaign in one of the local primary school to donate for children who have lost their hair!  Will says lots of wee girls are having their hair cut to help other children. He's done about 8 of them. Is that not just WONDERFUL. There are some fabulous people out there. Thank you again.  This is such a release on these long sleepless night, when I can't call anybody. Does anyone else feel there's such a load off when youv'e posed. I have never been on a social network site, never saw the need for it, but when I stumbled across this site, i just wanted to prepare myself as I don't know anyone who has been down his path.  As I said to Sue, what I didn't expect was to be in floods of tears at your stories and inspired by your courage. One last thing - my treatment is called - I kid you not FEC. Now you might know that I am Scottish, but my dad and my maternal grandparents were Irish and FECK is the way the Irish say the other 'F' word,  They kid themselves on that they are not swearing, eeven priests say it.  So henceforth please feel free to make use of my medication.  We are not swearing when we say fec, so I don't think we are breaking house rules.....

The priest thought for a minute and sighed \"All right Patrick. You have sinned and therefore cannot be an alter boy for the next month. Now go do your Penance\" Patrick's friend Eamon whispered when he left the confessional \"What did you get Paddy\" Patrick whispered back \"A months off work and 4 great tips on who to ask out\" Again great cathcing up with you all, Sue please contact me Jellytots are lovely wee sweeties, my darling sisters and .....

So I had to pick them up when I went to get my results of the biopsy - 4 days later. They were refrigerated in the same small ward where my brother died, and I was looking at the open door in which he died. Because there were injections and other drugs, the onc sister was on the phone for 10 mins to see if arrangements had been made for home visits etc and I just said that I had to leave. And told them why. They gave profuse apologies - no one's fault, just the luck that has followed me like a bad fart on a string for the last couple of years! Getting some of the side effect now, tiredness, tender gums at the back of my teeth,no swelling or pain just a wrong kind of gritty feeling. My eyes are a bit sore and light sensitive and  am very, very pale. But ..and I blush to say this .. I AM SEVERLY CONSIPATATED !!!!!!!! I have been living on homemade smoothies with shedloads of fruit for the last month, but my big tum is bloated and my wee bum is sore, even with the aid of, again I blush, gylcerin suppositories. Why didn't I anticipate this??  I am awash with water, tea and all sortsa fluids -a few wee drams as well!! We can't be unsociable when we go out with friends now! Getting my wig fitting on Wed next, and next chemo on - I kid you not - Friday 13th March. Isn't it ironic, doncha think? 'Like rain on a wedding day, a free ride when you've already paid ...' Great to hear about anniversaries and continuing good health - totally inspirational. Lisa, hope things work out. Confirmation names are picked by the child at confirmation and are, traditionally, the name of a saint whose life to which they aspire. I speak as a convent educated, Irish Catholic -Scot. Lots of Irish folk live in Scotland. I am now agnostic, but utterly respectful of the traditions in which I was raised.  I would perhaps ask him why he picked his confirmation name. Just to test/tease him. Do let me know his reponse .. It could be telling? Or at least a talking point. Cannot hurt to ask,my dear brave friend. Gotta try and sleep. nurse coming to give me a shot tomorrow. Nana - I am outraged at the treatment to which you were subjected. Like you,I have just stepped onto the the Yellow brick road and don't know what to expect but you were bullied and should take action. This is quite hard enough on it's own without the FECing bullying - or patronising - or condecending or dismissive attitude that that is deemed to be our lot. I know squat about the system in the U.S. but there must be a way that you can register your experience. Motto - oraganize - don't agonize! Love you lots like jellytots. Nets xx",

You open the curtains and you're back in Narnia!! Mind you it was ever so in Scotland. If you get tired of the season, just hang around for 20 minutes. Cathi, you must be so excited about the family coming down. I am restricted about seeing my dear, dear darling wee brother, his kids and our friends,  who live in England, because of appointments, I had a cold etc. My wee neice Sinaed was crying last night on the phone because I keep planning to go down but havent managed (I am usually there at least twice a month) Getting my bloods done tomorrow in prep for 2nd FEC on Friday and the hair is now coming out - quite suddenly. Still havent got the wig because they brought everything forward. With FEC you are supposed to lose all head and body hair within 2 - 3 weeks, But I still have most of my lashes (they're my one vanity as they are very long and black; and the eybrows are still there. It is still a shock though, isn't it, to shed your hair - even though you are totally prepared for it) Getting meds fro  my doc today to counteract the worst s/e of my 1st FECing experience! Cathi, do you have wee Margo yet? I think getting a wee puppy or kittten it one of the greatest pleasures in life. I do hope that you and Ed get to spend some more time together. My sis and brother-in-law are exactly the same, John works for the Scottish Government in Energy Conservation and now has to attend meetings all over the country and even in Europe now, and they hate having to spend any time apart. They, like you, have a wonderful partnership that is the envy of us all. They also have4 kids who are the pearls of my world. They only live 6 miles away so we see each other almost daily. This horrible recession will end - it's part of a cycle, although THIS one had crooks and incompetants at the heart of it!! - and things will improve. What a great man you have, and what a hard worker. You must be proud of him girl. Your wee Brandt is just EDIBLE. I love seeing pics of you guys, must learn how to attach pics etc. weren't Funni's just breath-taking? You know I mentioned Dancing on Ice - please look up Ray Quinn on UTube- he is a stunning skater, as are most of the celebs. I am especially besotted with Donal McIntyre (who is an undercover reporter) I think he is georgeous. Would love to hear what you discerning chapesses think ..... As always, love reading about you and sharing thoughs. Prayers and warmest best wishes to you all, especailly all of you who are worried about your family members. it's harder to watch someone you love in pain or fear than to go through it yourself. I know of which I speak. We lost 4 close family member in 13 months, including my sweet brother Charles,to cancer.  I also know that we have boundless strenght and that no experience can bow us. You have all been throuh so much, and your stories of coping, beating the dreaded boorface, or at least fighting it to a standstill has been a great well of inspiration for me. I don't have any cancer survivors in my circle. God, must dash, sorry for the sloppy spelling, grammer et al - I am a grammer Fascist normally! - there's a great book by Lynne Truss called \"Eats, shoots and leaved\" about this. I am in total accordence. It's very funny and about the power of the apostropty! Townee, you would love it. I love your posts BTW. You are a wordsmith girl. It's just as well I am a fast typist.

Getting a  present for my uber great sister today (her birthday on Monday!) and her son, my neff Gerard. and I are going to have a lovely Glasgow day.

Next chemo on Wed, I wonder what wonders it'll bring - smelling farts and smelly feel even outdoors, losing the rest of my lashes and brows - have not lost my brows so far girls! - or it might be uneventful. Who knows? What I do know is that it is shrinking the bejabers out of bootface so bring it on I say. Great to know that you are all there and all survivors and all strong and all supportive. It helps beyond words! Have a great weekend - Easter is just round the corner, Spring has sprung the days are long and sweet and life is good! I will be finished chemo by the end of April and post surgery by the end of May, so the horizon is not too distant! Godbless and tartan hugs! Nettie xxx",

His main worry now is the dog and the kids jumping all over him! He has bounced back remarkably, we can't believe they let him home so quickly. He is one of the funniest people anyone has known. He is like Billy Connelly, and I would love to give you his version, but would have to sneak it though customs .... OK, cleaned up version. He had 2 catherers up his willy, one for flushing and one for urine drainage. He had to drink 6 pints of water, the cathetar had a kink in it, pain, embaressment and a wee Malasian nurse who had to have a change of uniform.  It is better when he told it. But he was so glad he didn't have to see her the next day. The current wisdom about the delay is lettting me go after the mammo is that there is so is quite a lot of damage to my boob that it needed looking at closely if the doctor wasn't too conversant with my notes. I know I have a very deep bruise - about 2\", ny stupidity. When I had the Sentinal Node surgery I didn't go to have it drained. I thought the heat and swelling was just post op trauma, but it was a seroma. What a learning journey we are on lassies!! I have deep damage because of the rads too. But if anything nasty was suspected, I would have been whipped right in to one of the side room. I was so expecting that. I am a bit annoyed that I was kept waiting in a private room so long as I have been treated so respectfully thus far. God, that sounds petulant!  Cathi - any more news. I am itching to tear into Silly on Facebook. Can I??? Can I??? In the mood to vent at idiots!! Oh Rupert Murdoch and his press monoploy is on the ropes here.

Will get a more detailed prognosis on Monday from my wonderful surgeon. Got FECed at 1.30, it's now 5pm. Absolutly no symptoms. Onc nurse said that everyone's different. Don't you just get tired of hearing that??? Or am I alone in that. Everyone's on standby in case I feel ill. My nephew is staying over tonight 'just in case'. What he dosent know is that he will be painting my bathroom ceiling! Well he kinda knows. Tomorrow is another day and GOD ALONE knows what/if effects will kick in by then. I've tried to do as much as I could before this treatment started, but still wake up - usually in my chair - in a panic. Like have 'what have I forgot?' I know this will resonate with so many of you. I know I ramble on, and please forgive me but this is my wee release, during those sleepless weeks since Jan. And I have been able to share fears that I could not have done with my family or friends.

I agree, you need urgent intervatnion. My wee mum was ill for a long time and we whisked her in for IV antibiotics at the drop of a hat. At 4 am in the morning once. She responded instantly. I didn't know you had MRSA!!! What are they given you for it. I'm sorry, but I don't think you are getting enough care or support and I WISH TO GOD there was something I could do!!!!! I wish you lived closer or that I was confident that you were being properly taken care of. I know how miserable I have been this week with a racking cough and (very) high temp but sweetie, you should be in hosp! God bless and keep you! I am seeing if I can post a wee poem that made me smile ... The Boob Poem For years and years they told me, Be careful of your breasts. Don't ever squeeze or bruise them. And give them monthly tests. So I heeded all their warnings, And protected them by law. I guarded them most carefully, And I always wore my bra. After 30 years of gentle care, My gyno, Dr. Pruitt, Said I should get a Mammogram. \"O.K,\" I said, \"let's do it.\" \"Stand up here real close\" she said, (She got my boob in line), And tell me if it hurts,\" she said, \"Ah yes! Right there, that's fine.\" She stepped upon a pedal, I could not believe my eyes, A plastic plate came slamming down, My hooter's in a vise! My skin was stretched and mangled, From underneath my chin. My poor boob was being squashed, To Swedish Pancake thin. Excruciating pain I felt, Within it's vise-like grip. A prisoner in this vicious thing, My poor defenseless tit! \"Take a deep breath\" she said to me, Who does she think she's kidding?!? My chest is mashed in her machine, And woozy I am getting. \"There, that's good,\" I heard her say, (The room was slowly swaying.) \"Now, let's just do the other one. \u2018Have mercy,', I was praying. Next time that they make me do this, I will request a blindfold. I have no wish to see again, My knockers getting steamrolled. If I had no problem when I came in, I surely have one now. If there had been a cyst in there, It would have gone \"ker-pow!\" This machine was created by a man, Of this, I have no doubt. I'd like to stick his balls in there, And see how THEY come out.  ",

I know the befefits of walking and bowel function and would endorse Caren' s advice if you can do it. Barbe, my hospital experience was so bad I am making a formal complaint against the consultand - he ran from the cubicle when I rounded on him. It was his surgery who 1) sent me for a 45 minute barium enema - ugg!!! 2) dx diverticular discease and Inflamatory Bowel Syndrome, and that surgery would be the best option when I was well enough - I had just finished rads and was still getting Herceptrin. 3) arranged 2 follow up appointments with a doc, which HE subsequently cancelled.  He is an arrogant pig (all 4 of us in the ward has the same feeling!) I was given 2 ememas, which caused pain and urgency but did nothing to ease the mass. Also Movicol drinks. I told them that given my experience, one of them would be as much use as an ashtray on a moterbike! - On the Friday, when I told im that the Golden Jubillee could not do the scope (and I was scheduled for banding) because o the external and internal trauma (I has tearing) and that it was recommended that this be done under general. I got my appointment, went to day surgery and they were not prepared for a general, thank god I took the letter with me. I had taken a bad reaction to the Moviprep and they kept me in all day on iv buscopan.  Anyway, Mr H arranged for the barium enema (looking, as it turned out for cancer). Anyway, since Taxotere, I have had terrible bowel problems (mostly diahorrea, ofter watery) them slam dunk, everything just stops! When I want to A&E on Thur, I had NO bowel sound and had been bringing up bile for days. On Fri, he said (iin his indeciperal thinck accent and almost to himself) \"Ve get yo up next veek for camera\" Fine, me thinks, I cannot go on like this!!! On Saturday, he sid \"I sink it might be diet ....\" I exploded. He didn't even haave my copious notes, couldn't remember anything about my case , I told him that the Nutricionist said my diet was \"Magnificent\" and that mine and my sisters knowledge of nutricion was almost as good as her's!!. He fled, one of the nurses came back a few minutes later. I told her I was not standing for that, that I had those feelble little Movicals at home (a bloody suitcase ful), she asked if there was anythibng they could do so I said \"Get me Sennacot\" So yet I did leave totally backed up and vomiting. I took about half a bottle of lactulose and had the most painful BM of my life. The Nurse/Pracitioner called me on Tue and I let rip. SHe apolgogised sincerely and suggested that I speak to my GP, she agreed that I had grounds for complaint. I will get this investigated but by a bowel professional, not a general surgeon, which is what he was. Feeling so much more comfortable now (but wearing a nappy, just in case) I have been ill since the beginning of July. Calling my doc tomorrow. I feel too tired to keep fighting, onthe Work Capability Sham, mistakes in my Council Tax, the health probs cancer treatment has gifted me .. not getting proper medical care from this swine. Everybody knows me to be a strong woman, but I just feel - no more ... Sorry, and thanks for letting me rant.None of he family want to hear the details, but so many of you suffer from similar. We speak almost baby talk about bowel functions - have you had a poo?? When folk ask me what the worst thing about my cancer - the constant vomiting, bleeding rad burns, pain - I always say - the effect it had on my bowels. ANd it is as bad now as it was then. Barbe, I think I might have your problem. Taxotere can freeze the nerves of the intestines (I saved an artical by MacMillan) I just hoped that they would recover. Thanks girls for letting me rant, and putting this down chronology!! Nets xxxxx",

I too went to the doc felling vry low and weepy, the wee \"thickening\" i found o my cleavage didn't seem to fit any of the warnings about canceer, no pain, dimpling, unusuals site. I am just turned 53, so thought it was just a natural reaction to the changes in my body - my 'change' has been a breeze - flushes were infrequest, mild and not actually unpleasant!!. Cancer was teh furthest thing from my mind! But I know here was ... something wrong, a real feeling of hopelessness.  But I put it down to other things.  My brother, who was also my next door neightbour, died 2 years ago of cancer of the guller.  I had to cut my working hours down to 16 per week to care for him as his decline and death was so swift. Then I had to very painful urgery on my rught shoulder (4.75 hours) and had to undergo 14 weeks psyio to gain control, the fingers up the wall, crawling along a table.etc.  So my finanes are down to very little, and the contact that I was working on was not renewed because of the recession! Jan 3rd.  So all of these things made me think that I was just stressed out.  And I was. Saw the breast surgeon at 10.30, was examined, has mammo, ultrasound, fine needle aspiration and biospy, and diagnoses of invasive ductal carcinoma, 3.5cmlesion - attached to the skin. Poorly differentiated and high grade within 2 and a half hours.  Non hormone receptive and the ultrasound indicated no evidence of spead to hte lymph glands. I was in a daze, the only cancer we had in the immediate family was my brother, and now I was going to put my family through all this again. My sister ended up in hopital with a retinal stroke because of stress. So I was determned to shield them from all this and put the best light on it.  But I have been all over the place. I have forgotten what a night's sleep is, I live alone and am fiercly independant. Anyway my life is no longer my own. So much to do,schedule, finances to take care of - they have told me not to even THINK of seeking another job for a year, and I am to live, for the 1st time in my life - the pathetic benefits. I am more worried, getting dental work done prior to chemo, Wed am, seeing the Haven for Headstrong pm (seems strange since I have a full head of thick, blackhair at the moment) on Wed pm.  Getting fitted for a wig on Friday. Fitting in  the Bank ( I am paying off a HUGH bank loan) COuncil Tax to arrange a rebate etc in between times. My family all want to help, but it's insane that I should need to go through all of this.  I have my CAT scan on Monday, echocardiogram on Wendesday and I am getting the sentinal lode biospy on Thursday - all in the midst of these artic conditins - the roads to the host Ineast Kilbride were closed today! And we are under a foot of snow. My chemo is FEC and the onc plans 4 sessions to see if they can shrink the lunp so that I can have a lumptectomy rather than a mastectomy, then surgery, followed by radioation.  Thats the plan anyway.  If anyone could give me an idea what to expect - gratefully received.  I have done the reserch into the drugs being used (into medical sites rather than the ones offered by MacMillan) and know that 2 of the combo can cause carditoxicity, and one can cause liver damage.  The only way I can cope with this invasion is to confront it and to be treated like an intellegent, sentient being who is involved at every step.  It's how I will confront it.  My great fear, apart from the finances, is the fact that my right shoulder and arms ar already conpromised and it's the left breast which is afflicted, I have been through the whole wiping myself, dressing myself scenorio so am now heavily dependant on my left (non dominant) ar for most things now. I am registed disabled because of it, though no one would know to look at me because Ihave adapted.  But this thing will make my life so much more difficult. I am now in the accpetance stage, but feeling sorry for myself at teh moment, in the grip of this blizzard weather with a long, painful and poor road ahead of me.  I too have 3 cats, whom I love and they too have not left my side, aminaks are so attuned to their owners,dontcha think. Anyway, its now 3am and I want to get up quite early tomorrow to get some constuctive thinks done.  Done my shopping, thermometer, a metric tone of tissues (nose hair loss - I laughed at that but you drip all the time.  I am in the midst of a crappy cold just now. Lots of pobiotic drinks and yoghurts, lots of ginger snaps, and teas, bought a couple of hats (the first I have ever owned!!!) acupressure wrist bands and a new sonic toothbrush because my old one dies just before christmas (been brushing manually for about 6 weeks) I would love to hear how your journey has been as you are a year 'down the road' from me and your first post echoed the feelings I have just now. It really does feel like we are in an exclusive club and are having to go through a helluva initition process! Signing off now, Love and lollipops Nets xx",

She is on this Lighter Life Diet (NO FOOD, just supplements, black tea and water) But we sank a BIG bottle of cider, LOVED it, tasted great (so does Guiness, by the way). No hangover or anything today! Just a long lie (a sleep in). She will get hell at her wiegh in - they actually test the urine (I think that sounds a bit Nazi .. any thoughts on that ?) She has lost about 30 pounds in 12 weeks though .. Re the hair situation. I feel SUCH relief. Woke up withour hair in my eyes, mouth.  If I could relive the last month. I would get my head shaved at the first 'tingle' Nice hair, then a baldie napper (head) rather than nice hair, radiation victim living in a hairstorm - how does it get EVERYWHERE??????, baldie napper. I actually went shopping BY MYSELF today, now that the finances appear to be in the course of being sorted. I though dammit, treat day so I bought some nice nightwear, crystalised ginger - yum yum yum, yoghurt coated ginger, Vitamin D - is it good to take that? I'm sure I came across that in my meandering research, and lavender oil ... It felt like a GOOOOOD cancer shop. I was really tired, and consumed with thirst, and  because my heels are sore, was walking like an old lady, I wore the bandana with a wee contrast scarf wound through it (kept coming undone - me frantically trying to push it back, scared that an errant gust of wind would blow it away like a comedy scetch) went grocery shopping, and got a taxi home from my local Asda. I know the driver quite well (I do live live in a largish village) and he did avoid my eye and didn't mention the headgear, bu he did take my packages right into my home. So I think that's a lot of fears conquered!!! The family will be raging when (if!) I tell them I went to Glasgow on my own - it's an hour away by bus. They thought I was having a lazy 'day in' watching Slumdog Millionaire. I Thank God I have them. This has really brought us even closer. Cheryl, my sweet wee fellow adventurer. We are at the same stage of Chemo I think. I too, have no appetite, so I am just taking tapas type portions of things I love and can taste - slivers of good cheese and apple, ginger, wee Special 'K' nibble packs, dried fruit, ginger anything Will try these yogurt covered ginger this evening .... Got to be strong for Chemo sweetie. Do you like tea? I dring it by the gallon? And they have all of these great fruit ones so you never get bored. Wish I could give you a hug. But your humour still shines through!! Nancy, your poor dad. I know nothing about his condition? Is it some kind of Gastric/ulcer problem? It sounds ghastly. You have been so good to me N. Please know I will NEVER forget it. Your daddy is in my prayers. Oh,I am a lapsed Catholic of the Irish variety, I have an uncle who is a Canon! And a deceased uncle who was a Jeb (Jesuit) So even though I am an 'auld heathen', my family are very much devout. My sis is having masses offered for all of you every Sunday. By name. I hope you don't mind? So if you give me your Daddy name, he will be mentioned personally. It always concludes with \"and all of those who are stuggling with illness and their families and loved ones\" But if you want aspecil mention, just give his first name .....

Battling into the fray, and we Scots have never been defeated.  Just hasn't happened in history. The Romans didn't EVEN get into Scotland, they just built a bloody great big wall to keep us from giving them a hammering. It's called Hadrians Wall and still stands. Scotland alone in Europe and Asia was never part of the Roman Empire..Oh.  Remember Braveheart? The ENGLISH DIDN'T DEFEAT US EITHER. SO THERE!! Bad news is that it looks like I have the 'bad cancer' - like there's a sparkley, cuddly type? My dx is thus: high grade, poorly diffenentiated, 4cm tumour attached to the skin, ER neg, PR neg, so I think I mus be triple neg. Just did my good stuff on the medical web sites and it looks grim. Any you guys, apart from sweer Sue had similar dx? From the ultrasound, early indications are that the lymphs are free, but I am getting the sentinal node biopsy on the 12th which will confirm it.  But I now know that I cannot alllow even a 'good result' to lull me into a false sence of security. Because this is a scary thing I have. I have never known anyone who has been through this, so you girls help will be of the most enormous help.  My only experience of cancer was my brother who really caught the big one - gullet.  He was the very picture of health and had, like me, almost no symptoms. A bout of bad vomiting, put initially down to a bug, in hosp because he was dehydrated, and was given 6 -18 months to live 2 days later while still in hosp. Survived 11 months, and I was there all the way. Still grieving. It was only 2 years ago. We have no history of familial cancer so this happening to both of us is a mystery ...... Anyway, going for a full CAT scan on Friday, echocariogram Wed and surgury Thur, Please pray for me that nodes are indeed clear.  Chemo is due to start early March, onc does not want to risk infection after the biopsy, but my BC nurse thinks they might bring it forward.  BRING IT ON I SAY. Scheduled for 4 sessions (apparently triple responds swiftly to chemo) and then a lumptectomy if it has shrunk.  Poss some more chemo, then def rads. All sounded blissfully cool till I copped on to the fact that there is every chance that the sneaky wee jobbie might ambush me again when my back is turned, poss even mets to the brain. This is the illness that just keeps giving ........ Any ammo you girls have out there for my armoury in this battle? Seems if you survive 3 years, the futures so bright you have to wear shades? Getting fitted for my wig on Sat! and got my lesson in mad scarf tying this pm!. Bought 6 of them and my sis, 3 neices and my auntie had a wee scarf experiment party this evening! You have no idea how absurd were the fashions we fashioned!! Getting my hair cut pretty short tomorrow.  Did any of you guys lose your eyebrows/lashes or do they tend to stay? I am lucky in so far as Mr Y - the onc is one of hte most experienced in the country - he even goes to Europe.  He has me on FEC regime? Does this ring any bells out there? I am a pretty strong old bird, but the mets to the brain possibility took the legs from me. Did my big cancer shopping spree.  Bit less of a spiritual experience that most retail therapy.  Having fun taking Blood pressure and using the thermomoter. Playing doctors with the kids.  My sis is a nurse and she just tut tutted at me - superrior cow!!! Bought half a metric ton of tissues, anticeptic lozengers, hand gels and sprays, tee tree everything (swear by the stuff) ginger everything, all the probiotics - drinks and yogurts - multivitamens - have I missed anything out?? My doc will supply the mouthwashes, eyedrops etc, and they are prescribed free. Got my filling done today, updated the will and upgraged the life insurance. Life has been a whirlwind. But I still think I have missed out so much. Signing off now lassies. Look forward to your help, support and advice during this interesting time.  Did anybody else feel like John Hurt in 'The Alien' - an unwanted parasite eating away at you WITHOUT BEING INVITED - how bloody rude!  I's just a wee squatter and I'm  just determined to evict it. Again all advice warmly welcome ... Godbless, goodnight and sleep well  Nets xx",

Your pics were so lovely and you all looked so close and so happy - and now you have reason to celebrate! I am so very, very happy for you all! Cheryl, my hair (which is short) has started to fall out big time today - all of a sudden. With FEC, you are supposed to lose it within the first 2 weeks, so I stupidly!, thought i might escape it. Scalp is sore too - all of a sudden. Don't have wig organised yet either. The best stylist is in real demand and I have had to reschedule so many times because of my appointments being changed. I agree, you know it's going to happen, but somehow think it might not. I think everyone will mourn the loss of their hair (I will lose my brows and lashes too). It just another example of loss of control and identity. But we will get through it girl. Please keep your lovely chin up! Jane - next time you are in Scotland, I will take you over to Ireland, where my family are from. You won't stop laughing. The Irish treat serious things as a joke and a joke as a serious thing (You might want to look up Dara O'Brien on UTube - my daddy was just like him) Did you really rescue a Joey?. When I ws a wee girl 9 or 10, 'big bad boys' were throwing stones at a hedgehog near our caravan on the East Coast, and I rescued it, took it home, on my knee, and we built it a home in our garden shed. He was called Spike (original eh) and he was part of the family for many years. Didn't know they hedgehogs wee flea ridden at the time tho ... Night chaps, and hugs to all. Again Karen .... such good news ....   xxxx Nettie xxxx",

Need, need, need more photies of Margot, in an outfit prferably. The one in her pink cossie was adoreable. I really want a  doggy!!!! I kinda share my sister's cross collie Tommy (the cheese junkie - that dog would do ANYTHING for a lump of cheese)  but I only see him on visits. He knows when you are down, he sits on your bare feet and just keeps licking you. Still, I do have my lovely furry, purry posse. Whispa (aka The Big Grey) Pat the Cat (aka Patrick the Cattrick) and Teddi (aka Ted the Ned). But I'd love a wee dog to train and walk. Maybe someday.  The 'bimbo' is an old hag, sorry but she is, long straglly grey hair - ugggg. Mine's looked better when it was falling out with the FEC! AND I HAD IT SHAVED OFF!!!! BIMBO??? More like \"I aspire to be a bimbo, but am too haggard and stupid\". Even bimbos have minimum standards!!!!! My Chemo is now finished, now waiting for surgery (WLI and full node clearance) Might need mast, will have a week to wait for histology reports after surgery. So everything at the moment is the great unknown. Completely pooped almost all the time, tho' the s/e of FEC are deminishing in the most part. Eylashes hung on  till last week. Then Oooops, farewell to thee!. It happens that way, it seems with FEC. Up till now, I could make myself look 'normal'. Going to buy some sunglasses today (I don't own any, I live in Scotland!) So enjoyed catching up with you all after a few days away, still don't have my laptop, and using this old PC feels like work!! Any advice on Wide Local Incision and Full Lymph Removeal gratefully accepted! How long was it for you guys to start getting your hair, lashes, brows back? Hate having to to try to replicate them - badly. Want to be out and about without looking obviously ill, no matter how awful I might be feeling. Does that make sense to you guys? Cathi, thinking ALL the time about you and your daughter. Too cruel. Thank god she had her BEAUTIFUL children so young. She must look to you for inspiration. You guys (survivors) inspire me that one day, my life will be  normal again (sometimes it's hard, I can hardly remember pre cancer life, seems like a world away) Strangly, I too, have come to terms with mortality in the past few months. I have a strange preminition that I won't see 60. If so, that will  give me 7 years and if I get through this, I am determined that I will enjoy them and treasure them. I don't think that's morbid. I told the girl who gives comlementary therapy (bliss) those thoughts - she is very spiritual, and she thinks that facing the certainly of our own mortality,whenever it comes,  is very healthy. Can't tell any family or friends though,  that would just upset them. can share it with you guys though. Anyone else feel the same?Or are my thought processes being clouded by chemo? Your views, as always are sought and appreciated my this sorry Scots woman. Susan Boyle, by the way, another sorry Scots woman, was on Britain's Got Talent last night. She started off flat and nervous, but recovered and is through to the final. It's on Utube, if anyone is interested - look under Susan Boyle+Memories (the song from Cats) Hugs and blessing to you all Nettie xxx ",

Sorry I haven't posted for ages, laptop is being repaired and the old, ancient! desktop - I swear it's steam driven!, is tempremental. I have been catching up with my IPhone, but no good for posting. Nancy, your daughter is your IMAGE!! - she looks beautiful and your heart must be overflowing. I keep saying this, but you all have such beautiful children, and the CUTEST wee doggie in our Margot, Cathi LOVED the pics, always do. I'm so sorry you are having such a jobbie time of it. Looks like your unerring good humour has taken a beating. Wish I could do or say something to help. I could wipe the floor with the old hag, catty Carol, the ancient bimbo,toooo easy, but I wish I could magic away Jacklyn's problem. I keep thinking what I would do if anything happened to my 5 nieces ,and my cousin's daughter, who is like one of my best friends (she takes care of my furry, purry posse when I am away) and the thought chills me to the bone. I can't even bear to think about it. You have been incredibly strong. It's easy to be strong for yourself, we have to be. You are an inspiration in your support. And get to the bottom of the pain you are having!!!! I have been getting bone pain since chemo finished, hips and shins especially, but I know that is to be expected. PLEASE take care of yourself. Well, I got my surgery date Thursday 18th in the morning. I am having a wire loop inserted because the tumour is no longer palpable, and they plan to remove 2mm. If there are any suspicious cells in the circumferance of the 2mm lump, then I will be recalled for a full mast. I am also having the lymphs removed at the same time. I expect to be in hospital for about 3/4 days only, so not too bad. I have spoken to another girl who had the exact procedure and it isn't unbearable b any stretch of the imagination. There is a fantastic local (very local) group of about 25 of us all going through treatment presently and it has been a godsend as we are all so supportive of each other and live within 25 miles of each other. Having lunches around our full (treatment) appointment diaries!!! So ladies, finger crossed that the surrounding breast tissue is clean and then it will be rads (about 6 weeks daily, they estimate, physio and then a year of herceptrin) that's the best case scenario. Since the end of chemo I have been totally wiped out, much worse than when I was on it, surprisingly. I had about 1 in 3 days when I felt GREAT, now I just feel like the life blood had been drained from me. I don't this it's psychological, though I wont discount that. Got my appetite back now, but can't stop sleeping. Had visitors last night and had to nap at 10pm!! Just could not keep my baldy eyes open!! How long do you think before my lashes start growing back, by the way My remaining ones are broken remnants of the long ones I used to have, I actually pulled out the stray long ones because they just looked daft!! I am having a new power shower installed next week as I won't manage the bath - my right shoulder is badly damaged so my left arm is now my dominant arm and that is where the lymph nodes are to be removed, and surgery on my left boobie. That's my fear, that I am going to be dependant for a while post surgery. I have been able to do nearly everything for myself all through his journey, and my indepenence means everything to me. Och well, no point trying to second guess the future. I know I'll cope and come out of it stronger whatever the future holds. Say a prayer for me girls, knowing there are such great wisdom (Barbe, did you study Philosophy at all? You actually sound Irish in your comments. I can heat some of the things you say coming out of my dad's mouth. \"you're guilty, but you're not to blame\" is such an Irish wise contradiction.) anyway, such wisdom and great good humour and kindness across the pond is such a comfort. Enjoy this glorious Sunday - we have actually had a week of SUNSHINE, I have had the factor 50, yes, factor 50 and been sittting in the garden this week. Wish I had the strength to garden, but have pottered around. Whenever I exert myself, I end up panting like an old carthorse. Not a good look!! Blessings and best wished to each and every one of you. And the the new newbies, you will bless the day you stumbled across this site. As I did in the bitter cold days of January, shellshocked, newly diagnosed and terrified, here in Scotland. You will get so much support and advise from these wise and brave women who have taken on BC and WON! Welcome and warmest wishes. Tartan hugs Nettie xxxxxxxxxxx",

Got call on Tuesday from the breast care nurse to come in immediately as my bloods were low at my pre-op assessment. LOW!!! They were 8.2! I started out at 15 Hg. No wonder I have been so tired, I was one point away from needing a transfusion - they give that at 7Hg here in the UK. Anyway they took some more blood, an armful. I think, and I got the call yesterday that they ere 10.9, so the cancelled procedure is now back on. so pray for me my dear brethern, and that the margins are clear. My laptop need a new motherboard - I paid £800 ( about 1$1300) less than a year ago with a 4 year warrenty and then f%$&wit nephew spilled lemonade all over it. So now it's junk. And I am broke having plundered all of my saving to live on, so cannot afford a new one. So won't be able to take my laptop to hosp. Oh happy days!!! Enjoy the rest of the weekend.

My cousin and his daughter left last night and there is a ringing silence in the house. It was stressful being upbeat because I am feeling at a low ebb just now, drained of energy and full of self pity, but I really miss them. I am seeing my consultant tomorrow to arrange for an echocardiograph and dates for rads and Herceptrin, then I think I will take a break in Blackpool, seeing family and friends and getting a bit of sea air before the next stage of treatment. Cathi, I am at a loss for words. what a traumatic time for you, Jacklyn and the kids. On top of her diagnosis, she must be at her wits end. Thank god she has you. I am sure the stress of losing his job, a massive trauma, prompted his outburst. No excuse, I know, but money worries can drive someone insane. Is this an isolated incident? You had some regard for your SIL so I hope something can be salvaged if their marriage was a good one previously. But broken trust is hard, if not impossible, to regain. He had the decency to leave and might be hating himself just now, but Jacklyn has to put her and the kids safety first. What a mess! I wish there were some magic dust I could sprinkle (I keep getting that image in my head these days, about everything) to make things right It just ain't fair that you have all of this on your plate when you have your own demons to battle. I will have prayers said for you. My sister is very friendly with The White Friars, a Monestry. The monks are the kindest, most gentle people imaginable. There are quite a few of you in their prayers! I am 'the auld heathen' of my Irish Catholic family, but I feel better if I have done this. Hope you don't mind. AE, I am so very sorry that UB has contracted pneumonia. Are the antibiotics oral? Will they delay the chemo? Especially now that it is working well? It seems that they have caught it early, thank god. Sorry you have had to postpone your trip. You must be so disappointed. Do you plan to came over later, once UB has the all clear? My brother contracted it and it stopped his chemo. His cancer was different, he was terminal, so it was the chemo that was basically keeping him alive. He was very weak when he got it, so didn't stand a chance. That's one of the reasons I have been so sad, it was his 3rd anniversary on the 13th. Sue, at least you know your dad is in good hands. That's an awful long time to wait for results though. Is there anyone to care for him at home? You might want to contact social services and the Occupational Therapy unit to see if he needs amendments to his house, laundry done, meals being delivered etc There is quite a lot of help out there, but you usually have to seek it out unless you have had a good social worker in the hospital. It's pants when your loved ones are miles away, isn't it? Even a journey of a few hours is too long. At least you'll be able to spend some time with him now you are on holiday. I am to have WTC ended on August 13th, you only get it for 28 weeks, so money will be awful tight. I'll have to find a relatively well paid job pretty damn quick as I have plundered all of my savings. I still have had no word on DLA, though I am assured that I will get it. They are inundated apparently. So many people applying. Think a lot of it is the stress of redundancies and the recession. I have a Welfare Right Officer pushing it for me, she is campaigning for cancer sufferers to be fast tracked. Anyway, additional stress. I have never been in this situation in my life, never had debts, never missed a credit card payment or a loan payment, always had enough to live on and a few grand in savings, so this is new to me. I am tired but can't sleep. Jeez - enough about me!! Lisa, hope your results are sparkling! Your post always make me smile. Funny, I can't bear the thought of any of you suffering! Any more news on the dating front! 'Fess up! Barbe, Mick Jagger!!!!!! I've told everyone about it. You should be on stage girl. What are they going to do about it. Don't they dissolve them with some kind of sonar?? My Dear Uncle Peter (He was the spitting image of Sean Connery!) passed 4 stones, 2 of them about 2 cm, and really quite beautiful! My auntie was going to have earrings made of them!! only kidding, but she still has them and they DO live in her jewellery box!! do know that he was in great pain and passing them, well, he claims he gave birth to them! Och well, I am sorry for the tough times so many of us seem to be having, your kind words always help. I suppose I will just have to adapt to a different kind of \"normal\", physically, financially and emotionally. I so wish I had my old life back, just one bit of it. I wish I could motivate myself to go to Maggies Centre or the Haven where cancer patients, current and cured, and their families and friends can meet , do projects etc. Maybe I just can't accept that's the new \"normal\" Once bootface has infected you, it leaves it's mark doesn't it? OK depressed you gals quite enough! I will let you know the results of my meeting with Mr Yusef tomorrow, and remind myself - again - that I am lucky to be alive! . I spoke to the registrar before my op and asked him if I hadn't acted would the cancer have killed me and he said \"Yes, and probably within a year!\". I should be smelling flowers better, water should taste better and I should look at the world in a whole shiny new light. That's the impression I am giving everyone, but inside I am scared, I am still sore, had my bum fluff hair shaved when I got my new Irish Jig, so I'm baldy, my feet are still numb, I still don't have an appetite, though I havent lost wieght (nope, there are no good s/e of this girls bootface), I lack energy, am pessimistic. Not a good look! Sorry again, so many of you are having a much harder time then me, but this is so cathatric letting this out. I know I am probably depressed, I was following the death of my dad so I know the signs. When I was dx, my doc prescribed an anti stress tab called Lofepramine, I don't know if they are any good, and I havent taken them religously. I will make an appointment to see her next week, need to get the swine flu jab and I'll discuss it with her Sending massive hugs to you all, and especially to all of you who are toughing this out. My mantra is \"this too shall pass\". Love from Scotland Nettie xx",

Likewise housework, and I cannie be arsed doing any of that. This is the 1st Easter weekend that I havent been away, beautiful weather, planting my hollyhocks (think they're hollyhocks anyway) that I grew from seedlings last nov tomorrow, in pots and planters, they are beautiful; got about 80 a sea of reds and golds. Getting a greenhouse soon so that I can indulge my passioin for growing. Cathi, I cried about Cheryl's result. I was a bit casual about cervical matters as so many of my circle have had laser surgery under local - in fact I thought at one point,about 18 years ago, that I needed it but it was a mix up. I wasnt even worried, but as we now know, it can be much more serious. I hope and pray that it won't be for J. She is beautiful and your wee granddaughter s a DOLL!!! On a lighter note Margot is uber cute. I have shown her pictures to everyone (not the posts, just the pics) and everyone now wants one. Think my fave is her first bath, so sorry for herself!! I love having an Auntie Em!! I got the yellow brick road analogy instantly because it is SOOOO apt! You are a genius girl. My onc team are all calling our journey now \"the yellow brick road\" so your fame has tranversed the pond - have I told you how much I love them???? I almost look forward to my sessions. They like my analogy of bootface being an invadert, FEC my wee solders and the s/e is collateral damage. The infection was 1 million times worse than the s/e. Like UB, really fatigued and disgusted with myself. He ok - apart from the tiredness? I am still seething about Karen's husband's comment! I sense a bit of a recurrant theme ... Nancy's brother too and the MIL from hell. Would love to have half an hour in a locked room with them .... Bless the day I stumbled, confused, shellshocked and frightened, in the middle of a bitterly cold sleepless night into - of all things - an American support site! Feeling so good, I might join my buddies, not on holiday - in the pub this evening and have a couple of Guinesses. NB Cheryl is having the most awful time. I feel almost guilty that mine has been relativly pain free ..Wish I could magic here. My care has been outstanding!!! I'm so lucky to be in the catchment area of my hospital with the wonderful team. The Onc consultant, Mr Yusef, is a MBE - one of the top honours - given by Lizzie (Her Madge) at Buck House.Havent seen him personally since diagnosis, but probably will next (last) fec where he will outline the next steps ....

I mercifully stumbled across this thread this time lat year when I was poleaxed by my dx. I have seen some of your posts and hope that the dark cloud that enveloped you then has evaporated now.

Concerned about you pet. There is a song by an Irish band called Ash called \"Shining Light\" (Annie Lennox covered it too - BTW, my brother knew Annie, long before the Eurethmics) I think of you (and of Lisa) when I hear it. Don't know why ... something indominable about you 2, Go on - Utube it if you haven't heard it already. And keep well. And let me know how you are. Or I WILL worry. Don't make me worry.

Please girls, a big collective prayer that he will appear at my window with his big clown feet mucking them up! Counting on you. Hope this Monday proves to be the bestest week for all of you girlies.

The s/e - sore mouth - I had that a LOT of the time, sore feet and shins, bone pain from the jabs the awful \"end problems\" - need I say more (?) are diminishing but the FECing fatigue is getting worse, so much that I am struggling to say awake ALL the time. No one can give me an idea of how long I can expect this to last, but I have so much to do, financewise etc that it is putting a real dampner on my life, and my social life - I'm Nettie Van Winkle!!!  Having a snooze in the corner while a band is playing (that was last night, before they work me up, took me home and tucked me up!!) Well, I am seeing my Breast Consultant in the morning at 10.30 so if you could spare a prayer for me from across the pond ... Will find out if it's to be a mast or lump. They will do total lymph node removal, thats for definite as is my HER 2 pos status, so I will be on Herceptrin for 18 courses (all day - for a year) def rads too, think about 6 weeks daily as the bootface invaded my wee lymph glands. Might also need more chemo once they have looked at the tumour. That is what I definitly know thus far, will know more tomorrow about timings. The surgery hold no fear, I have had great pain in my skeleton through injurry, ruptures disc , scititica (Mel, sweetie, back pain in uber commanding. You have my deepest sympathies. Mines was the vertebra at the very base of the spine, where al the nerves congregate. Sore, sore, sore, sore, sore!!!) I went for Chiropracty, which help a lot. expensive, but witin 6 weeks of 2 sessions a week, I was 75% better! Still sore at times because back injuries heal so slowly as there is no blood or oxygen supply. Have you tried chiropracty, it doesn't work for all, but sure did for me. TENS machine to  helped when I was really bad, for  my shoulder too. They are now DIRT cheap. I like to take natural things as much as poss - I have enough poison going through me at the moment!!! I was wonderful to see all of your pictures, I've said it before, you have such beautiful children  andit is wonderful to see you all, through the trauma and loooking great. It gives me such hope when you feel that everything that you are has been taken from you. Nancy, so glad you dad is much better, Treasure the time you have with him! Cathi, laughed like a drain at the pic of Margot giving you a tongue facial, you look like so much fun. How is Margot? Still stealing the show? I was gutted to see that Jacklyn is havign to go through all of this. Al the reassuances that Cervical cancer is usually ralatively minor to no avail. But if she has the spirit of her mum, and the humour, she will come shining through. Sweet Sue - hello, hello, hello!! I know the weather has been shite in Scotland too, and I'm feeling the cold at the moment. My poor wee garden plants are dying that I grew from seed in the horrible months post DX. I    am loving American Idol, the final 3 were awesome, but wee Chris is so beautiful I just want to stare at him. Think Adam's got to win though. Alison was great. Janis Joplin is one of my all time heros and \"Cry Baby\" was a filling homage. Anyoldhow my dear brethern, my hoover and my fridge have both died today - covered by extended warranties so I  must get on and get them reported before the curtain of weariness decends!!!!

Cathi, what you said about Alexis asking about her wee boobies wrung my heart. I was down visiting my brother and all my friends 2 weeks ago in Blackpool. My neice (of whom my bro has sole custody) is 12 in September and is terrified as she is convinced she will get BC. Her Aunt (her mum's sister) was diagnosed with BC when she was breastfeeding her baby  - she was 38 at the time, 3 years ago, and now that I have got it, it is praying on the sweet child's mind. She is complaining of pains! Hugh, my dear bro , told her they were just growing pains that that very girl her age gets them. Imagine being 12 and scared of cancer! We don't want to lie to her or patronise her (she's way too bright for that anyway) so can anyone sugggest anything? It's awful that children caan carry such fears. I hardly knew what a boob was at 12! On a brighter note, thought I would share some absolutly crappy jokes with you, if I may ... How did the stranded pig get down from the roof? The Swine Flu. At the Baker's Olympics, a pasrty chef was disqualified for making a false tart. What noise annoys an oyster? A noisy noise annoys an oyster! A frog walks into a bank to ask for a loan. His teller is called Patsy Whack. She asks his name. The frog replies \"Kemit Jagger, proud son of Mick Jagger\" She asked him if he has any collateral. He produces a beautiful snake figurine. Nonplussed, she seeks the Manager for advice about the collateral, if it was acceptable... HIs reply ... \"It's a knicknack, Patsy Whack, give the frog a loan, for his father is a rolling stone!\"  (Helps if you sing it.) What do  you call a cat who has just eaten a WHOLE duck? A duck filled fatty  puss! I thank you. Nettie xx ",

Loved the comment of coughing so hard that you were guffing away involuntarily. I though that only happened to me! Cathi, I am so sorry you are in so much pain. I have suffered on and off from sciatica following a fall in 1996 and it is the pain from hell. I found chiropracy very helpful though expensive. I also use a TENS machine which is non invasive and drug free. You can get them really cheaply now. I don't know if it will work with bootface, but it is useful to have for general pain. The thing is that you can get days that are pretty pain free and the next day the pain is breathtaking.  Hot baths and Arnica too helped me. Praying that you get some relief soon. Nerve pain is so bloody commanding! Barbe, good luck - hope you make the right decision. This could be a great opportunity for you. Your wit and humour - and brains - should land you a promotion. Fingers firmly crossed. Poor cat is still sore and wants to on his own an awful lot. I hope he gets better soon , it breaking my wee heart.

The site of the lymph removal is very hard, swollen, and red and sore though. Is this common? I am finding it uncomfortable to wear most bras, and I am an E cup. I am also feeling more tired than I did through chemo \u2013 how strange is that???? Will post tomorrow to let you know f I need a mastectomy, more chemo, both or just rads and Herceptrin. Feels like it will never end. My brows and lashes are returning and my hair is growing back, but mostly colourless!!!!!! Quite a lot of grey when I had hardly any \u201cbefore\u201d My BC (before cancer) I have so much to catch up on!!! And I am knackered. One thing I did catch was the news about Dennis. I am so sorry Lisa. I know what you mean; cancer seems to be everywhere \u2013 no escaping it. It seems like I get news almost every day that someone\u2019s mum, workmate or whatever has been diagnosed. It is s modern plague. I was on FEC, but a high dose. They use it a lot here in Scotland for aggressive BC \u2013 I know 4 other girls on it. Unfortunately, almost everyone on FEC loses all hair, body and facial, but I kept a lot till the end, and now as I said it\u2019s now reversing. I wish him the best of luck. I do know that it is very effective \u2013 my tumour shrank form 4.5cm to 16mm after 2 sessions. So the surgery was much less invasive. I hope it does the same for Dennis. Still on my old PC, laptop is going to cost £400 to repair and money is so tight. I haven\u2019t worked this year! So I hope this posts!! I\u2019ll post over the weekend to let you guys know the results. Say a prayer for me. To Cheryl and the other lovely ladies who e-mailed and PMed me, thank you for your concern. You truly are the best and I love you. Will take ages to catch up, will do it over the weekend. Are any of you watching the tennis at Wimbeldon? So exciting. Andy Murrey is Scottish (he actually was a survivor of the massacre a Dumblane when the madman Thomas Hamilton murdered a class of 8 year olds and their teacher in the mid ninties) He has been SUPERB and is through to the semis.

We in Scotland just celebrated the 10th anniversary of Devolution and the setting up of The Scottish Parliament a few days ago! So not as flamboyant as your celebrations, but still a FREEEEEEDOM, Braveheart moment! A very hungover me today - woke up at 10.30am -yikes, My wee cats were OUT all night ( thank god the torrential rain had stopped) and I am feeling every emotion under the sun. Mostly shamefaced, mouth feels like a litter tray, have drunk 2 pints of water and am still thirsty and .... yet ...slept like a baby. Got pure Hell from the furry, purry posse when I opened the door though. Not happy kitties. All of yesterday feels like it happened to someone else ... including the fact that my surgeon has left. So I saw a rather hunky Irish consultant called Dermot Murphy. So we were waiting for ages - over an hour - as he had all of our medical histories to bone up on what our stats were. I am still in shock, and now hoping he hasn't made a mistake about my results! It's my niece's 18th today, well it was on Thur, but we are having her garden party today, marquee etc and I feel sicker than I did on chemo!!! Self inflicted - shamefaced! At least if I start hurling like a champion I'll get looks of sympathy and not disgust as guests will just think I'm poorly coz of bootface. Actually, the family are all a bit worse for wear too, both because of my good news and the disappointment over the tennis result. I remember vaguely getting a call from my friend Heather in the middle of the night in tears. Checked on my log and yes, there is was. 4.05am, a 'tired and emotional' aye, right, Heather - crying about a bloody tennis match! Think she had a large money wager on Andy Murry reaching the final! Need to go to hosp again as there is more fluid build up and need to get it aspirated before I get ready for Carol's party. She is off to Glasgow Uni in September to study Microbiology and Zoology and was top of her year at school, so we are kinda proud of her. There were 2000 applicants for the 70 places on the course because it is a springboard for all sorts of medical careers, both in human and vetinarian fields. She is a crazy, mad animal lover, so wants to be a vet. This way she can keep her options open though. Looking at 8 years of study though! She is a lovely, gentle lass, so we want to give her a nice day, and a big congrats. Just occurred to me. Thank god I won't have to give blood today at the hosp as they would put me straight into rehab! Now going to take some tea and anti emetics, and tread my well trodden path to Outpatients. Luckily, I only live 6 miles from Hairmyres. With a glad heart, a thumping head and a sour stomach, I wish you , my American friends, a HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY and a great weekend!!!!!

What treatment are you getting for your mets? Julie, my wee rads Buddy from rads (in that horrible grip of winter last December) had cancer of the siliva glands. She is doing well, but had a dog of a time eating, swallowing etc. She is so much better now, and she is in her 60's! I so hope Blaire fares the same. Here's hoping. Julie, you have NO IDEA the amount of disruption the ash cloud has caused here in Scotland. I live under a fly zone and it is just now that we are seeing contrails regularly. One of the girls on Herceptrin had to have her family come over to drive from scotland to Benidorm in Spain to get her back for treatment. The protocol (here, at any rate, is that if you miss a course, you have to start the 18 again). But it is just travel disruption, nothing to worry about - there is no health risk from the ash, not even in the Shetland Isles, which is closer to Norway than Scotland, so very much closer to the eruption. Lots of folk on holiday in Europe couldn't get home and no one was taking responsibily for getting them home, or taking care of them while abroad. It's just never happened before, so it's untrammelled territory. The current wisdom is that there has been a bit of over-reaction by the CAA. Anyhow, it is JUST TRAVEL disruption. Crap, but not dangerous. If Devin ventures down to to he Mediterrainian coast he will meet as many Scots, and Brits, ever a few Irish .. as he did here. Madrid, Granada, Northern Spain - less likely ... I am meetng both consultants next week, Onc  and one for the long term s/e. Wed and Thur. Bit nervous. I have had my 14th Herceprtin last Monday. Only 4 to go!! Nearly at the Emerald City.

It takes it out of you to be positive all the bloody time, even if you actualy feel positve, subconsciencly we do have that wee fear nugget buried there, often justified! Well, got the final scores my loves.. Bone scan was clear. Some damage caused by accidents and a bit of wear and tear, but the pain attributable to the ba fall I had when I ended up under a bus in the middle of a blizzard just befre Christmas. I am sooo very relieved as my tumour had it's own healthy blood supply, so another route for the wee terrorist cells to find new homes. Not quite such good news form the barium procedure. I, too, have diverticulis and piles (which have shrunk very well, so no surgery needed at this stage - although we have to monitor carefully)  I also had a fissure which was very large, but now healing well. No wonder they couldn't  do the op last November eh? Proves I'm not a wimp, which I felt I kinda was at the time. So I am waiting for an appointment at specialist clinic and on a priority list, so if I bleed or get bad pain, I have to get myself up at once to hospital. Oh I also have Irritable Bowel Disease (which I think Ihave had for a long time - had quite a lot of pain and cramps, more like spasms actually, But sparodically, do you know what I mean? Most of the time I was fine. But I am a veggie (fish eating veggie) so have a high ffibre diet, so symptoms would have been minimised. Oh the joys, eh? BUT .... no sign of cancer, so all the mixed news - the bad news too, my new \"friends for life\" - seem like a mild cold. Any tips of diverticulitis control? I have had a wee trawl through the internet, but NOTHING is like someone sharing personal experience. This last 18 months have taught me that!! Mixed news on the babies too. Wee Amy is pretty ill, was in ICU (now in High Dependancy Unit) She was born without an ear, jus a lobe, but it seems that she has severe breathin problems. Poor baby had to have a trachiotomy (sp) yesterday. Her throat is 'floppy' and her jaw needs work too (we cannot see that) Her mum and dad are renting a hospital flat so are there 24/7, except for coming up to take us down. She is critical, ut is looking at a long road ahead. She is ok, not in pain, but we are all beside ourselves. My cousin (her gran) flew in yesterday. So we had a nice evening all together, despite the circumstances. It's just the thought of taking  a scaple to a tiny baby's throat ..... On the positive front - ironically - Hughie, Kez and Lilly Rose are coming up today for the Bank holiday. I cannot wait!! I havent been well enough to go down so this is the first time  I'll have seen her. Weather has been lovely - we were warmer then Spain. I hope it isn't going to be hard on Marie and Steven, seeing a perfect (but unplanned) baby when they had such a hard time having Amy. Steven (nephew) and Hugh (my cousin, his uncle) are incredibly close. Sorry, we are just so upset about Amy and her parents. They aren't going to have another child (Marie has a deficiency, and she is the youngest of 14 children, so they planned a big family, Amy going to term was a miracle, she is a miracle, and she is in great hands at Yorkhill Children's Hospital. She is contented in hospital, does not seem to be in any distress, even with the tubes, wee doll is a placid wee thing anyway. Sorry, rambling ..... I have had 2 nights solid sleep though - long time since THAT happened, so I must have been more stressed  than I thought! Oh Big Whisper, my fine 3 legged furry, purry friend is fully recovered and back to his big sweet sappy self. He is so clumsy and find it hard to jump up on high places. He does manage the sofa though! The fur has grown back so the stump at the hip does not seem quite brutal. I will be getting a new central heating system installed, and the house painted as soon as my friend Joe can fit me in - then a wee holiday (Blackpool and Ireland probably - with a wee weekend in Strathpeffer in the Highlands) I am to get some intensive physiotherapy to strenthen the muscles affected by the muscular myopathy. Still got the neuropathy in the fingers and feet, though a distinct improvement in the fingertips. Have some nail growth too. Hair has decided to grow back properly now. I had the chemo hair cut off, started using Head and Shoulders (the Zinc helps growth appently) so I can go 'topless' Will still use my Irish when I go out, but think in a couple of months it''ll be back to pre BC. It was like Liza Minnelli's before, so pretty short. Well lassies, that's all the news from the front. Sorry it's SUCH a long post. Judie, best of luck with surgery. Got a wee insight into your condition now my love. That must have been why I was in so much pain going through Tax, spasms and contractions - I could time them. They lasted 20 seconds, about every 20/30 minutes) I couldn't open Devin's blog, but  I see he's in Rome. It is AMAZING! When we were travelling, my friend had a cousin who is a translator there, so stayed at their beautiful villa in the Capitoline Hilll for a week. I am mad, mad, mad on history (especialy Ancient History - I was training to Teach English and Anceint History in my youth) What is the next stage of his wanderings. I know he is going to Paris to see Muse. Devin and I share a lot of taste in music! He didn't know that the Fratellis come from Glasgow (he was amazed when they came on in a pub in Glasgow!) Franz Ferdinand are Glaswegians too - I have seen them. Snow Patrol are Irish but studied and still live in Scotland. Scotland and Ireland are almost interchangeble ... We'll guys, going to make some Lentil soup for Hughie and Kez - their favourite, and the easiest soup in the world to make. Love to all going through trials, myself included, We are amazing. I have now decided that I am going to be there for my family and friends, not strong for them. It is great to be in remission Only 4 or 5 more Herceptrin then check ups and recon to go.

Meant to be getting the Herceptrin on 3rd August, and the Taxtotre on the 4th. I have had to put it off because I need some dental work done, starting 3rd, and now will have to postpone THAT again as I am off to Clones in Co. Monachen, Ireland, where my Dad came from, and where my brother's ashes were scattered, at the family plot.Brother died on 13th July 2006. Yep the old bootface, Gullet. Inoperable. We are still getting over it. My wee brother Hugh has paid for the Ireland break, so I just have to re-arrange treatment dates. I know the cancer is not there, so there is no massive urgency, just so many bloody arrangments. So...... tomorrow,,,,, after the echo, it will be a lot of calls. Be nice for a few wee more breaks before chemo .... again !! Has anyone else has \"The Yew Tree Poison\", combined with Herceptrin, post surgery. Herceptrin day 1, Tax day 2.... with rads after a break and then 18 rounds of Herceptrin thereafter? - Seems such a lot, where when I had such good initial reports post op?????? Any way ... Lisa, brilliant news. How great to to be told it's 'only' athristis. Or as as the old folk say here in Scotland Arthur Itis. Every old person here has a friend called Arthur. Either she/he has it so some bloody else in there circle has! But it is no joke, it's a pig of pain. But ... better then we know what than what we fear. Cheryl, where are you? Sweet Sue, try not too think too badly of your dad's partner. She might have been trying to spare you. Your dad might have been too. The first thing that would have sprung to your mind was not the thing that sprung to their mind. It's not bootface. Your dad had trouble with his gullet. Buhlieve meeee. If it had been bootcase, they would have known. Please sleep well, and try to see your dad soonest Take care Nettie",

I know that Child Welfare is paramount (God knows there have been shocking cases of neglect and death over here) but it must be plain to anyone that the kids are SAFE AND IN THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE with you and Ed. You don't need scrutiny, but do need support. Is Amanda still besotted with her husband despite his appalling behavior? And as per usual, no mention of YOUR health concerns. Putting youself last Cathi? I am furious at your daughter for allowing this to happen after all you have been through. Lots and lots of love and good wishes flying across the Atlantic my dear. Darling Judie. Thank you for your advice on diverticulitis. I actually met a girl who delevoped it following cervical cancer, so it can't be that uncommon. It's compounded by the IBS though. Marilyn has given me lots of advice. She was dx 4 years ago and had no plans for surgery.I am finding a high fibre diet seems to be the best - lots of fruit and fruit juice. I was sick today, but mostly fine. I am to get myself straight to hops if I get a temperature so I am back to daily checks. I wish I was well enough for surgery, maybe next year after my recon. Please pass on my regards to Devin, the well travelled Yankee. It's horrible what the breeder did. What an overreaction to a simple request. Guiness is adorable. I love Spaniels. We had an English Springer Rhona, and adored her. I hope you can manage to get him back. You clearly bonded. You really fall in love with your pets, don't you? My friend had got a wee Jack Russell, Sam. he is 10 weeks old and a total bundle of fun. I love when they fall asleep without warning in your arms. Good luck in getting him back. You must be thrilled having Devin home. Is he getting restless yet. Once you get the wanderlust it is comanding! Good luck with your hospital appointments. The waiting is awful and you just wonder if anything nasty is lurking inside. Shiela, hav they got back to you yet? You have done really well getting this far, especially not having been interviewed for so long. My last job but one had a protracted recruitment process, 4 interviews. I got the initial phone interview on 25 September (I remember coz it was my Niece's birthday) and finally started in November! What a production! Hopefully when I am better, the company I was working for will just give me a start date. I passed the tests etc beforehand. How did the interview go? Did you get a good feeling, the positive vibes? Even if you are not lucky this time, it will be valuable experience, but I so hope that they realise what an asset you are. Fingers firmly crossed. Well I had my 2nd to last Herceptrin last Monday, over an hour, not 90 minutes like before. Wow! Did it ever wipe me out!!!! I'm  at that strange transition period where treatment for cancer is coming to an end. Half of me is relieved and the other half is terrified. At least Herceptrin is keeping the cancer at bay, like garlic to a vampire. We all feel the same, we Monday morning girls and it is something we were told to expect. It's the long term side effects that are the problem! Hopefully I'll get used to them. Well Lilly Rose's christening was wonderful, almost all the family was there. Also has a friend's hen night (batchorette party) on Saturday and a fabulous Celtic Celebration. Needless to say, I slept the 200 mile journey home! I am taking my nephew Micheal down to Blackpool next weekend for his 21st, and taking my niece Sinead back for a month!! She is looking really forward to it. I am taking her to the Highlands - absolutly stunning scenery. Devin took some great photos of Scotland in FaceBook. Looking so forward to seeing everyone again. I might be attending a funeral though. My friend David (he is actually like a brother to me) dad is dying. Another victim of bootface, pancreas. He was only dx last month! Dave has just text me from hospital. He lives in Blackpool too, like so many of my family and friends and at least my brother and cousin will be there for him. He was a great support when my brother was dying, he came up a lot (400 mile round trip) My friend Shraron (who was dx 3 months before me and has been a godsend) is pretty ill now. Her cancer has spread to her lungs, liver and abdomen and not responding to chemo. She is back on Herceptrin, but it isn't helping. The staff at hopsital (she attends the same hospital as me) are in bits. Her dx was very similar to mine. Huge, young cancer (stage 3, grade 3 with node involvment. It could so asily have been me. I've actually got a bit of survivor'e guilt, especially on the \"down\" days when you feel you are never going to get truly better. Wee Amy Ellen is triving, she is home now, but on a nasal gastric tube and a heart monitor. She has been dx as having Goldenhars Syndrome, and is actually on the lower end of the spectrum. It can cause massive facial disfigurment but is is barely discernable in Amy, she doesn't have an ear though, but that can be remedied surgically over a series of ops when she is older. She is a beautiful wee morsel. I must learn how to post pics of them all. Both are really contented, beautiful wee girls, my heart just brims over. Hopefully there will be another on the way soon, Peter (Nephew) and Ann Marie are desparate for a child. Anyway my darlings, that's the news from the front. Love and hugs to each and every one of you!!! Nets xx",

Sue, the reason I asked is that I have diverticulitis, which feels, to me, like the hip. I thought it was. Do you have spasms, or unusual bowel action, or elevated temp? Might be worth checking out. It's not something you would put on your Christmas list, but bootface it ain't! Well my loves, got my last Herceptrin yesterday. Mixed emotions. Very. First you hate the whole thing, then you tolerate it, then you  get used to it, then it becomes so much part of your life that you feel your waterwings have been taken away and the water looks awful scary. Does this echo to anyone??? On the positive front, all signs are no sign of cancer, bloods, heart etc in fine form. Seeing my consultant 30th Septeber for final score. Doc on Monday thinks boob signs are scarring rather than rads or chemo in system, but not to be concerned. I did get a cud",

I will need rads, of course, and Herceprin for a year, but my sweet darling darlings - I AM CANCER FREE at this stage.

Saves the build up (203 emails when I got out of hospital). The old thing is having trouble opening up attachents, so will really need replacing! Karen, I know a break from family strife will do you good. As kids, we had a very close and nearby extended family. My mums 3 sisters wee like mothers to us. So whenever we had the screaming meanies with beloved aged parents, we had rooms with our aunties, so it was kind of a revolving sleeping situation. And tempers calmed down very quickly. We all lived about 5 minutes away from each other. Teenage siblings often cannot breath the same air. happens in every family. Bet they will be mega close when they reach their 20's. But a wee bit of space when the hormones are zapping all over the place will be helpful. So think of this as as temporary as you want it to be, try not to treat it like a big deal (even if you feel it is) and hopefully enjoy the blessed sound of silence fro a while. Lisa, good luck with Wayne. I love hearing your dating exploits and your unerring optimism, gives me hope for the future and a smile for the present! Hope it works out dollface. I know I said before Lisa, but FEC is cruel but wow, so effective.By the sound of it, and the number of treatment Dennis is getting, his dosage will be quite mild so hopefully the s/e will be mild too. Of the 5 of us who have had or are getting FEC in my circle, one girl was neither up nor down, one is currently being constantly sick, she keeps having to be taken it to hosp and they might not give her FEC next time, and the rest of us suffered the usual drech! Both Sharon and I now need NO MORE CHEMO, and we had very agressive cancers. the other 3 are still getting chemo. But it seems to be soooo good at killing the beast dead. I hope this helps, please tell Dennis it saved me and Sharon and prob the other 3 lassies getting it now. And hair, it does grow back. Oh yes it does!! We are in the midst of a heatwave, having had 2 summer free years! I am upstairs for a quick shower. Got to be very careful in the sun now and keep my \"at risk\" arm well protected so slapping on the factor 50 - almost sun block - and then out to read for a while in the garden in the lovely late afternoon. Can any of you gals advise me about rads? Both Sharon and I will be scheduled to start as soon as we recover from surgery and get the all clear from the Onc consultant, but we don't know anyone who has had this treatment so advice from personal experience will be really helpful. I will also be on Herceptrin for a year too - one day every 3 weeks for the whole day in hosp, 18 sessions in all. Anyone had that treatment? Thanks for all your good wishes, I can see a light at the end of the tunnels, and it's emerald green! Nettie xx PS: UB & AE - when you are in the UK, can you spare a day to pop up to Glasgow? Or Edinburgh? It's not too far from Wigan, about 3 hours by car. I know Wigan, my brother lived there a few years back, in a wee suburb called Asram. I'd love to show you a wee bit of Scotland. If you can squeeze this into your itinery, please, please let me know! Carol (my niece) had a lovely birthday, and so did we. Managed not to be sick. Thank God for anti-emetics!!!

I am insisting on you're being selfish over New Year. Please don't let me down. On this side of the pond, you might know that we have been ice gripped for about 5/6 weeks. Cars left in the snow, guttering falling down, no public transport to speak of .. they had a bone fide wee avalanche in the poshest shopping centre in Edinburgh when the snow just cascaded down from the roof in a - brief, but dramatic thaw!- Swept people off their feet. My toilet froze on Christmas morning (overflowing, don't ask) Family due to arrive at 3pm, turkey still to cook. No plumbers willing to come out. All self rectified by next evening, but Thank God my next door neightbour and I are friends in the interim! Oh a wee Christmas 'miracle'! You might know that we are aminal daft in my family. And that my big Whisper had a wee MIA in the last big freeze in Febuary, wandered in with his wee sister in the middle of the night - I couldn't sleep, but his leg was badly broken? Anyway poor leg had to be removed - he WILL NOT GO OUT IN THIS WEATHER NOW - ugg, litter trays, but thank god is happy and healthy and a bit stir crazy - wants to go out, frightened to do so, much like me at times! So, my sister's young cat was let out at 8am by my wee niece Claire at 8o'clock on the Sunday preceeding Chritmas day (they are awfully pedantic) He was gone, the kids (and Sis and BIL) were printing posters, asking neighbours to look in sheds, cellers - in temps colder than the North pole!! - no sign. Wee Rock strolled though the back door on Christmas day at - 7.15pm (told you they are precise). No injury, bone damage, totally as he walked from the house; but stinking of incence!!! Not the nice smelly stuff joshstick stuff, but the 'incence' They think he might have followed them to The White Friars (though he has never been in the car). Anyway, he was missing in Artic conditions for 6 days, came back unscathed, uninjured, no sign of being unfed and bloody noncholant about what he put his family through. Miracle? For me The Jury's Out? But I had a happy family on Boxing Day, Well, I must steel myself to go shopping for New Year, fresh things, salad and bread - thing I have got most things in. NO COOKING.

Anyway, one of my tutors, a nun called Sister mary Olgivly was out assesing us in St Particks just at Edinburgh University and this very disparate group of weans - the 4 Johns ( all with IQ that were Mensa level, Jon, John and 2 Jonathons as I recall) were at one table, The 'ordinary' kids, the 'travellling' kids (transitional workers) Sister Mary was outlining a lesson in 'what did you do in summer break' We are going to make a book about your experiences' From one of the kids (who was under a table) - a BEAUTIFUL wee blond curly haired angelic boy (5 years old - we were primary school student teachers) said \" Not another fucking book\" This has endured in my memory since. The redness on a nun, in full grey habit, and we trying not to laugh,, I still smile at the memory. Mind you we still can say FECING (like the Irish do) without being potty mouthed. Doncha think/",

My bloods were too  low at pre chemo to proceed but bounced right back. I am so relieved it has started and waiting anxiously for any side effects. I have been pretty sick but am pretty sure that it was just the bug. Hand is  a black and blue mess as they found it almost impossible to get the cannula in, Herceptrin through the wrist and Tax through the thumb in the end. Hopefully we will avoid installing a port. They can't use my at risk arm so pretty restricted, alas! Herceptrin costs £30,000 oer year. Thank god we have the NHS. One lady at the Herceprtin clinic is on her 47th treatment!. I had thought it was a number limited treatment. However, it is so reassuing that there is no limit based on cost if it is needed. (Incidentally, please do not believe any negative news on cancer and the NHS, I and my family have had the most superb care on the planet..) Oh laptop working like a wee pussycat by the way. Any news of Blossom? Was she ill or poorly, or old? Cats do go on adventures so hopefully that's all it is. My 3 wee cats have had colds, and wee Ted (the Ned) got really pretty sick a couple of days ago - sent me into a panic, but she had came round. I love the wee guys to distraction. They love it when all I can do us veg out and watch tele (will be on that train again soon) as they just join me on the sofa and go into a purr fest! Great to have you back Barbe, miss your wit and wisdom big time. Hope the wedding was a blast and bet you were the life and soul. Do you miss Mick? Cathi, Landen is a wee doll! You guys are great at capturing moments! I would love to be in a noisy, chaotic house for a while. Silence can be ringing! I love living alone, having guests, which I do a lot. Usually glad to have the house back to myself ... but sometimes ..... Oh well Lisa, the concert looks great, fulfill a great wish? I l love live gigs and seeing heros. I love festivals but couldn't go to anything this blasted year because of bootface.Pics were great and you looked radiant. Good to hear Dennis is tolerating FEC and that you are on good terms. He will be grateful for your knowledge, insight and support Ihave no doubt. The path reports of my tumour showed that it was less than a year old, had growm to 5cm and would have killed me within a year had we not caught it when we did. Scary, and humbling. Another girl at the Tax and Herceptrin clinic has EXACTLY (it seems) the same type of cancer, but her's didn't respond as mine did to FEC. Her tumour wa 10cm (and she has very small boobs) it was soft like normal breast tissue and even her doc didn't think it a cause of concern, just like mine. FEC shrunk it to 8cm so she is getting Herceptrin and Tax, and poss rads before she has her mx. So I am lucky, lucky, lucky, and Carol thinks she is too because so many of us walk around with this silent terrorist within us, detected only when it is too late. Like I said - scary but humbling. Both my breast consuiltant and my onc consultant haave both retired, so I can't even thank them. Thank god they stuck around long enough to save my life. Hope all goes well with you lovlies and praying that sweet wee Blossom finds her way home, and learns her lesson not to stray. With heartfelt hugs to you all Nettie xxx",

There is nothing more magical than a new baby in the family. We have 2 babies on the way in our tribe, one is my wee niece (she is only 20 and had put on 3 stone - about  50 pounds!) and the other is my cousin's son. They have had 8 miscarrages in the short time since they got married so this is a truly longed for baby! My sister has been really busy knitting baby garments. I can't because my fingers are still numb from the Taxotere! 7 pounds is a great, healthy weight for a wee baby girl. We are all praying for a safe delivery, including the White Friers, the saintliest monks you would ever hope to meet. We are all here if you need to unload. I know it has kept my sane in the deep dark moments we all have. Keeping strong and being brave for your family is a natural instinct I think, but sometimes it's hard not to dispair and to be able to share is such a relief. Well, that's me had 10 rads now. 20 to go. Holding up well, just a wee bit sore under the armpit but God! it is tiring!! !I could sleep all day I think. Love and hunners of hugs to each and every one of you! Nettie xxxxxx",

You know they have no morals, ethics or consistancy. You are being used as a convenience for monetary purposes and to give them a social life. I think it is an outright disgrace that you have no rights enshrined in law. Laws are made by lawmakers, and laws can be changed/altered/amended/exponged. It is an evolving thing. otherwise we would still be stoning women to death, and bear baiting. So I KEEP REPEATING - contact local groups and your political representatives!!!!!

The Redmond family is so unlucky, Lyyne died (BC) Corin died (cancer) and Natasha through a freak accident. They are a talented, ethical family and only Vanessa (mum) remains. Natasha donated her organs and 8 people are alive or their lives improved because of their morals. Sorry, I was really upset. Anyway GO Liam!! Love and hugs to each and every one of you. Oh Hugh (Shuggles) is ready to go back to work! Check up in (now) 8 months. He said it feels like a bad dream now.

I have replaced all my linen in the last couple of years with Egyptian cotton etc from there. I checked and they do not have a London store (surprisingly) but you can buy online. Check it out!! They do all the designer brands for a fraction of what you would pay in say, Debenhams. If you want to give my mobile number to Devlin it is 0788 883 0317and I'll be glad to recommend some other places. What fun! To be able to help shopping! Tell him just to price around at the moment as London can be expensive, can be great too for prices, but like all Capitals you can be ripped off (Edinburgh is just as bad, believe me)  Check out JD Hughes yourself! You can get a memory foam matress topper, a decent feather duvet, Egyptian cotton duvet cover, memory foam pillows and top quality, Christy's towels for about £100!!! £150 if you go for the best quality. He will want to take them home with him! If Devlin wants to visit Ireland, I can advise there too (my dad was Irish) He can sail from Scotland to Belfast for about £15 return. Belfast is the Capital of Northern Ireland (Ulster) and that is British (I know, it's a bit insane and has caused immense problems - now solved - throughout the past 90 years). Dublin, about 100 miles south is the Capital city of ROI (Republic of Ireland) They have a different currency (the Euro) so the \"South\" is quite expensive to visit as the Euro is strong against the pound just now.

If I recorded it for you, can you play that format in the US? If you like the main character, he is in an award winnning show called \"Father Ted\" about 3 priests on a wee Island in Ireland. One of the funniest things ever made! Well girls, I am off for High Tea, yes, High Tea.

It's lovely, light wee morsels and only £5! We have been a coup;le of times now and it's great!. They serve them in these old fashioned cake stands with layers, it's like stepping back in time! Lisa, you dog! Where did you get him? Does the shop ship abroad? I am willing to pay the postage (or the airfare) Seriously, he is a wee bit gorgeous, aint he? Best of luck girl. Hope he is as good as he looks, and as good to you as you deserve. Share him with us though, and make me jealous! You really are an inspiration Lisa, So many of us will be wary of embarking on a new relationship after all we have been through and the changes made to us and your story of having fun and living life to the max fill me with hope. Nancy, good luck with the scaffolding. Most of my boob is still intact, courtesy of FEC,but has a golf ball size \"dimple\" situated right at the top of my cleavage, so that will be fixed next year. Of the girls I have now met who had had recon, none have had problems, everyone just show off the work!!! Like you say though, not to be lopsided will be great. (Lopsided is the expression they use) Keep us posted I am on Facebook, but have not really got to grips with it. My new resolution ..... Off for TEA ..... Nettie xx",

Well Hugh and Kez (darling niece her her dad) are gong home tomorrow. Her wee baby, Lily Rose's head is engaged, so she could pod at any time. We were up talking till 4am this morning. She is only 20, looks 10!, and the whole thing has become so real for her now. We have all been buying stuff for the baby and we were oohing and aahing, so many beautiful wee things (all infant, she will grow out of them in 2 shakes of a lamb's tail, but who can resist baby garments??) Her dad is already spoiling both of them rotten - she is an only child, go figure ... I got my bone scan and a CAT scan last week as I am pretty sore, but that is probably from the fall before Christmas. Scan is just for peace of mind. I did set off Geiger counter in the day room though!! All of these things that would have scared the tar outta me this time last year are nada now. Also got my date for the bowel op (Gulp) 9th April. I think they are giving me a general - that was the script when I was down last time in November when there was too much trauma to proceed. Will master Facebook - have looked up some of your photo albums, thank you for sharing. Have you checked out Devin's? He is a talented photographer for certain sure and took some cool pics of Skye and Oban when he was up visiting. He is coming up in April again and it will be sooooo good to see him again. By that time I'll have worked out how to bluetooth pics ... Never been much of a photographer I'll confess ... Big Whisper the cat is much better, but very ungainly and timid (he was the friendliest cat in the  world before, but he was cuddling in to Kez last night when we finally hit the sack, purring away) Love to all of you, Hugh and Kez will be home soon so better get prepared. We are all absolutley exhausted (doesn't take too much for me at the moment, and they have been on a whirlwind of visits, catching up etc) Will miss them terribly when they leave tomorrow evening, but will see them when baby pops up!

Got my last TAX on Tue - yippee - and go for my rads simulation on Monday. Alas, I have the 'problem' back. A completely distended bowel. I checked and it can be a system of peripheral neuropathy. I have numb fingers and feet already. It sound trivial, sniggeringly laughable almost, but I am in pain, cannot eat (at all) so I am feeling as weak as a kitten. I might have to go back to hospital again. When will things ever get back to normal???? I am worried that I am not well enough to go through rads. I have not heard of anyone else whose bowels have totally stopped working, except for gas. I am embaresssed to talk about this, but it has now been since mid August. Combined with the other s/e, I am really miserable and am scared that this will be a permanent condition I will have to live with. I know everyone will find it hard to believe how bad the situation has become, as I am on 3 lax medications to no avail. I am scheduled very soon for a banding procedure (next week, I think - we have a post srtike on at the moment so am not sure of my date) and my bowel will have to be clear for that Don't know if any of you can offer any advice, but if so, I would be massively grateful for any. Thanks anyway for letting me unload. Great news AE about you and UB!!!!! These wee nuggets of sunshine make my day. The old bootbace just don't stand a chance against you guys .........

I am feeling a a bit defeated as everyone else I know is making a good recovery. Will let you all know the results. So many new girls too! Sorry you had to join this wee club, but you'll  get heaps of support and encouragment here, from some of the wisest and wittiest lassies around. Good luck and godbless!!! Cathi and Lisa, please give my best regards to Kim and Blaire. They are now on the list of people being prayed for by The White Friars! That's the monastry in Rutherglen my family frequents. It is so hard to watch people we love having this madness thrust on them - the overwhelming sense of helplessness you feel. Be strong guys, like you know you are. Darlin Judie, what can I say? The only 'problem' (apart from accidents and skelatol pain) I had before all this was in the old bowels, an boy it reared it's head during treatment! So I know how nasty and painful (and embaressing?) it can be. In fact, that's what I am off to discuss this pm. I didn't know anyone who had BC, but quite a few with bowel cancer.  So many antibiotics!!!! I hate antibiotics, I'm sorry I missed your birthday! I havent seen Devin's blog, I check into fb every couple of days or so. Havent fallen in love with it yet. What problems has the lad been having? He might be a bit weary of travelling by now and soon he'll be soooo ready to go home. Then he'll get restless again, I'll wager. You will be missing him dearly though. Hope you feel well enough to enjoy the plans you have made - they sound fabbie - and that you sail through surgery and the nasty bit of bowel that has been giving you such discomfort is removed without any muss of fuss!!

Got gel and dressings from the fabulous nurse at the cancer unit. Not painful, but some bloody (and smelly) discharge. I feel so much better now.

I make a production of present wrapping so they are colour co-ordinated and beautiful and I finally feel CHRISTMASSY!!! Did some housework too, bit restricted as the nails are coming off - still getting the s/e of chemo, and did a bit of last minute shopping yesterday after rads ON MY OWN. I felt empowered. Cathi, you are indestructable, and an inspiration, as always. Hope 2010 bring an end to you hip pain. Pain is commanding. So glad you had a great night out. You are lucky you have Ed. He sounds like the most wonderful man. And wee Ella is safe into this world. Thank you everyone for you kind words and shared experiences. I look forward to the day - soon - when I can reassure the frightened that these things too shall pass. When I had the bowel issue I was convinced the damage was permanent as it lasted the whole of the chemo, and beyond. And TAX can cause peripheral neuropathy of the bowel. So painful and you feel constantly sick too. Then lo and behold, as the days went on after chemo normality returned!!! Still need the op to repair the damage but that will be when all of this is over, and will be done under general, not local, anesthetic as the area was too traumatised. Then that will be another box ticked. Think the lesson I have learned is that we might just be poorly, and nothing to do with the therapies!! Jane, Judie, Shiela and everyone. I love and admire you all and cannot emphasis enough how much I appreciate your support. We have a fabulous group here, all local to the West coast of Scotland, young women with bc and we email, chat and meet very regularly - but we are going through this at the moment - at various stages. Some are nearing the end of rads, some going through chemo still, so we are kind of like the fighting the war together (that's exactly what it feels like) You guys are wise survivors who are a source of hope and wisdom. Going for lunch tomorrow (still have no appetite alas) and to get very late shopping. Hopefully I won't fall. We have had blizzards here in Scotland too. Looks great but icy underfoot!! Oh - finishing rads on 5th Jan (4 of which are boosters) and then Herceptrin for the rest of the year. I have been gettign Herceptrin with Taxoter since August, and getting concurren tly with rads for the last month. No bloody wonder I am tired and run down eh? Seeing the breast surgeon on 8th Jan who'll advise me of next step - if any. Also options on the lumptectomy, I think.

Need details, close details pretty damn quick! Glaad you enjoyed the hols with your girls ... and mysterious Mr Mr ....? Well kiddos, news fron the front. We are in the steel grip of Artic conditions, we here in icy Scotland are a half degree warmer that the SOUTH POLE. Minus 20 odd degrees, with no sign of a thaw. We have actually almost run out of grit and snow. This has been for a month now, so we are all getting a leeetle tired of the winter wonderland by now, buhleeve meee. I had the most wonderful Hogmany (New Year). Almost all the family, and very close friends were here and we had an absolute blast. I was very sore from the fall (caused by kids throwing snowballs at the ONE solo bus journey I attempted), it is a police matter, 2 women were calling the police about them when I got a snowball in the face and ended under the bus! The ambulancemen wanted to take me to hospital and I told them that I had just come from hospital and was going back tomorrow .... Anyway, my back, shoulders and hip are black and blue and I think the kids have been caught as I got a letter from the police urging me to press charges. Still sore but getting better. Was VERY painful lying on the table for rads though. On that subject -------- I AM FINISHED!!!!!! 6 weeks later. Got burned at the collerbone (looked like I had a hickey from a vampire, especially when it started bleeding) but not really painful now. I saw the breast surgeon yesterday (finished rads on Wednesday) and he said it will take a year for me to be healed because of the intensitivness of my therapies. But he will make sure the old tit will be restored to it's former grandeur (LOL) I have an appointment for Jan 2011. It might shrink too, so next year we can discuss next step. Seeing new onc late Feb, slightly apprehansive about that one ... My head has sprouted some bum fluff (was slightly freaking because about 6% of Tax causes permanent baldness, and my hair took a good while this time. Lost it with FEC, started growing and then lost it again) So we'll see... Fingers ae still numb and all but 2 nails have fallen off, so I feel so clumsy, cannot lift things. Pretty unpleasant, be better if the nails recover though. Well girlies, think that's all the news. Oh I went out for the first time time in ages (tiredness, rads and the bloody weather, say no more!) to see Sherlock Holmes. fabulous!

Great prognosis, such a relief for you. Your cousin is lucky to have you in her corner. Mixed week for me. I was physically sick when we went for a meal on Monday (so horribly embarressing)  They wanted to take me to A&E (casulty) but I wanted to wait a day to see if it was a bug (I am not getting chemo or anything now) Feeling ok now. I was never sick pre BC and it just brings it home how much the whole thing takes out of you. By Thursday I was well enough to go on a HUGE shopping spree. Just what the doctor ordered, retail therapy. Was flat out on Friday but it really felt that life is flooding back into me!!!!!!!! Got some great bargains too. The recession has meant that there are great bargains out there. is that the case on your side of the pond? I got the most beautiful David Emmanual blouse for £5! He designed Princess Diana's wedding dress. I came back like a pack mule .... I am going out for a few drinks with my friend Caroline tonight. I can now enjoy wine again (lost the taste,in fact it make me ill duing Tax). Another step to normality my friends. Just need to get strong again. Any tips/supplements etc that any of you found helpful after treatment. I don't seems to have any horrible s/e with Herceptrin, hope the old heart is ok, a friend had to have is discontinued as her LVF was 42. I will get an echo on my next treatment. My poor sister (who had rhuematoid athritis, very painful as it is an auto-immune disease) had a horribe fall down her back stairs (25 deep concrete steps) on Thursday. No breaks but deep bruising and she is in terrible pain. She has been a rock for me (we are incredibly close) and it just breaks my heart. With something like BC, we have all sorts of support network but there is nothing for her and people like her. The kids have been great but I am too bloody feeble just now to be of much use. Frustrating. She hates a fuss (like me) but she is confined to bed and getting by on strong pain pills. Well lassies, off for a wee gargle. Think it'll be Bailly's tonight.

I can only lift my legs 2mm hen depending on the thigh muscles, though near mormal with bent knees. Lots of work to do!! I took a deep breath and bought the top of the range AreoPilates machine. I'll have to find a different way to do things, like I had to after my shoulder injury I suppose. No pain at all (physio said sometimes it can be very sore, so I am lucky) Wee Amy's home, got some new piccies, will try to post. She has the sweetest nature, a sleepy, smily wee baby. We just adore her! She still has to be fed partially through a tube, but I am dying to be on  baby sitting duty soon. nope, Don't know why it works sometimes and not others. Will try later. Lots and lots of love to you all, special wished, as always to our wee pal, Cathi. Pic of Brand dressed by his big sis was just great. I laughed out loud! Nets xxxx",

I would be a basket case if I had so many blows in such quick succession. By the sound if it your gran's demise was swift and peaceful and that is something we all hope for. My dads passing was beautiful (I know how strange that might sound) We were all there and a priest administered the last rites. It was just the death he prayed for. So different from my brother's ... But your wee heart will be sore and there's just no getting round that, gotta go through it. Good luck and hugs and warmest best wishes to you all. Nanci - wee Ella looks like a REAL baby. Like she's got a HUGE set of lungs. She looked like a wee fragile doll at Christmas. Beautiful but so very fragile Now she looks older than 2 months, doesn't she?? All that worry and she has emerged a wee warrior. Well done Ella. Well done too Ezsribe for taking a stand about - of  what I can only describe as abuse - of your medical care. As a teenager, I loved Robin Cook (still do) and remember the horror of malpractice in the hospial system. Fiction, but where is scope for abuse there will be abuse. i am outraged that Nancy DOESNT EVEN KNOW what she is going to be hit with. Ask yourselves, you wouldnt put a car in for repair withoutknowing how much the final bill wold be. And you have already PAID for your treatment. Your lives and deaths are too important for scams like \"report writing\" by an observer to be at YOUR expense. Be as outraged as I am girls - no other country would allow that to happen. Am I right Barbe? Hi Jane! Big Whisper is clumping around with a stookie (plaster cast) Boy is he clumsy! He always was - great big clown feet. He a bit sulky and feeling sorry for himself. He definitly went into a huff for me leaving him overnight at the vet's Must learn how to post photos - he really looks funny. Vet was great, while he was under he scaled his teeth etc. And the whole thing cost less than £100. He's registered there now. A bit of travelling but WTH. Had a great weekend,  we decided on an Egyptian meal(with belly dancing) then a wee pub crawl finishing at O'Neills for live Irish music. Did the whole day without throwing uo too!! I was afraid of that as I still throwing up an awful lot. I don't think anyone would have through we had all just been fighting cancer - everyone looked insanely healthy, including me. I have looked healthy all through this apparently. At least that what the docs, nurses tell me. It's just the most lovely Winter's day. Very cold but no wind, a blinding while sun in a clear blue sky. Just beautiful! No more snow please. Had enough for a lifetime. I can see signs of Spring all over the place, wee crocus and snowdrops beginning to push their lovely wee heads through the grass. Have a lovely Monday chappies With love Annie xxxx",

He has to have his lower hind leg amputated as the dislocation has not healed. They took the stookie off as he was dragging it. The break is now healed so he is not in any pain and he will manage fine without the 'hanging bit' - it's just annoying him. He is weight bearing, much better now that the cast is now off. Op is scheduled for March 9th. He is in great health (got  through check up at the animal hospital) and they think he got himself trapped, hurt himself pulling himself free. My, what we go through for our wee pets!!! Looks like our Devon, Judie's son is coming up next week! Judie, weather has been just beautiful this week. Bitterly cold, but no wind, snow or rain.Bright sunshine but no heat in it! Hope it stays that way for next week, but we live in unpredicable times weather wise (mind you, in Scotland we always have) Just e-mailed the lad. Checking to see what's on in Glasgow/Edinburgh by way of theatre action ... Hope the funeral went well Shiela. They should be celebrations. My dad always said the first three letters of funeral was FUN, and for a reason. He said it means FUN for ALL -  that's the Irish for you! You know that those we love never leave us.

Wee thing still need special, high protein/calorie milk nasogastrically, but she also takes normal formula. I will post some more pics - sometimes it works and sometimes it don't ... Shiela, enjoy your severance pay and don't hesitate to do a wee bit of self-spoiling! Enjoy your new laptop (I'm a bit of a gadget freak myself. Love  my toys! I have got the new Nokia X6 and just love it!) Actually I should bluetooth pics to my wee netbook. That should be simpler.. Good luck too on the job hunt and try not to get too stressed. Nancy, so the mystry is solved! It's somewhere we have all been at some point, I had an Amex many years ago and had a small debt on it, but my job ended very suddenly (it was Government funded and our funding agency was replaced without warning) It cost £1m per annum to run and we had no time to secure alternative funding. We were a charity and I had 20 odd staff. It was heartbreaking and the small debt loomed SOOOOO large. It took me a year to pay it off. Mind you, it was a good old lesson ... What a good mum you are! Any news on the job you were interviewed for?? To all you ladies facing hysterecoties (so many of you!) I hope the treatment is not too awful. Why are so many of you faced with this? Is it cancer related? I don't know of many folk here faced with this. I wonder if \"current wisdom\" varies from the US and the UK .... Well, gor my last (I think) appoointment with my Onc consultand on Thursay. The results from last mammo were within normal range, even though the boob itself is hard and inflamed - even now.  I am getting quite a bit of grief from the diverticulitis, been throwing up too. i am trying to manage it but cannot identify any triggers. Had some great days lately though and lovely days out to the Ayrshire coast and the close highlands (we have some Munros, hills over 3000 meters, within an hour of Glasgow so journey not too taxing) Wish I could go hillwalking - the views are wonderful! I spoke to Devin on Facebook yesterday! I only go on every few days so it was great catching up. Judie, he is such a pet! Hope he just jumps on a budget flight and visits soon! Well loves, great hearing from you all. Cuddles to each and every one of you!!!! Nettie xxxxxx",

I have been a Co-Ordinator of a charity,been an account manager and, because I am a knowledge junkie, went back to Uni in 2001. The theory is great - Total Quality Management, pioneered by the Japonese after world war 2 - is a fab concept. And one that we applied always anyway. Always strive to do things better. But now these ... people .. have taken a concept, pickled it into a dogma, highlighted some buzz words and think they have reinvented the wheel. I am angry on all your behalf. And mine. Actually the trick is to use the buzz words. Big Whispa is cool. He was so unlike himself, disappearing into god knows where in my wee house. I had my nephew looking after him while I went through to Edinburgh. Poor old cat licked the joint through to the bone. Came down for breakfast yesterday covered in blood. Poor nephew hit the deck, I almost passed out, Today he is back to his old self, minus a leg. I have been given an Elizabethan coller to put on him, but don't think he will need it, wound look so clean - and we know a clean wound do we not girls? - and he is on the mend for certain sure. Sorry Judie, but going to wax lyrical about Devin. Lovely lad. Will meet him tomorrow to wave him off to London. He has been to Skye and Oban and not frozen in the process. Cathi - the pics of Ella in her wee headband were - how can I put this - ADORABLE! To think the worry we all had before she was born. Brandt always looks great, but his expression is amazing.

Good luck with the flashes. I have managed to escape that in the main (just about the one bloody thingI have!) Gilrs, I havent been down to England yet to see Lily Rose (got lots of photos sent up, but saw wee Amy Ellen yesterday. What a wee doll - she has got a massive head of jet black hair and dads upturned nose. Soon as I work out out get pics in will post. All babies are beautiful, but she really is a doll, I think it's the hair that does it - so cute. and she smells devine. Cathi, she also has a deformity in her ear, poss some hearing difficulty too. Got hosp on Wed for scan (barium enema) Which means I won't see Devin before he heads back down south unfortunatly, then Herceptrin on Monday, so will be going down to Blackpool on Tuesday for a few days to see the family and wee Lily. I literally cannie wait! I still think of my wee Kez as 10, she still looks VERY young - she is only 20. She had the baby at home, not planned. She had contractions, rushed to hosp. They stopped and she decided to come home. She was in the bath and they started up again and 2 hours later, Lily was in the world! Diane (her mum) delivered her, so not planned, bu perfect. Poor wee lass needed a lot of stiches though!  Big Whisper is doing absolutly great!!!!! He somtimes forgets he is minus a leg and land on where it used to be and hisses at himself, but aside from that he is in great form and enjoying himself, getting up to as much mischief as a big lazy cat can get up to. We've weathered a lot, my big cat and I, and came though Well, waiting for the decorator to show up - house needs painted. He was supposed to start on Sat, but I was in town with Devin, yesterday was seeing Amy and sleeping!! I lost all my plants in the hard winter, so going to do a little light gardening, bulb planting, bit of weeding. When my neighbours kids come in from school, the will help me clear the big planters and put in a few plugs. It's a lovely day here! putting on High sun protection then into the garden! Let the guy get on with prep for painting. Oh Judie, Frazier is on the tele ( it's a double bill every weekday morning) It's one of my fav programs of all time.

And Amy seems to be becoming the centre of our lives. She is a sweetheart and still has a long road ahead of her. When she was born, we had no idea of the extent of her  condition, as it can be severe. But Amy is on the low end of the sprechtrum, thank god and the prgnosis is even better. That's probably why we are so in love with her, but I swear she just loves everyone. I got enough points on my \"medical\" assessment to class me as severly disabled, but fit to return to work within 6 months. My Member of Parliament and some Journalists are committed to bring down ATOS, and of course, I am co-operatng with them fully. And advising other BC sufferers about the way the system is designed to fail everyone except the terminally ill and quadraplegics. So I am fighting back against this shower of clowns who are paid a fortune from MY taxes, and who are unemployable with our Health Sytem. This is according to a GP (Family Doctor) who attended an ATOS recruitment drive and was so appalled that she is actively camapigning against them. And our biggest National newspaper has started already with an article \"Wefare Warfare\" I am enjoying the campaiign, got my fighting spirit back! Sorry I have been mia lately, been caught up in research and getting e-mails prepred to send to all of our political reprentatives, lots and lots of anger on Breast Cancer Care UK. All of which needs to be directed. I am watching True Blood while typing, god it's extreme!! Love and lollipops my classy lassies!  Nets xxx",

It's pretty unspeakable that he is putting on the hero costume about \"taking care of you\". How FECing patronising. I so hope you are getting good professional and personal support. Judie, Judie, Judie - hugs and suchlike for your surgery. I saw the specialist a few days ago and surgery might be on the horizon when I am well enough. I would have liked to to have it done this year so that next year would be a brand new start but not a possibility just now. Wee Amy is still in hospital, but out of High Dependancy Unit. She might need the traciotomy until she's 3 or 4 (she had a 'floppy' voicebox) but she is still a joyful wee bundle. But a long journey ahead for her in reconstruction etc. Lilly Rose is just fab, fab, fab. Her baptism is on July 4th - so you will all be having her party I hope. Incidentally, your football team are aquiting themselves OK in South Africa! Didn''t lose to England at any rate. All of Scotland were behind them! And Cathi - Ella is a wee doll, and Brandt is a heartbreaker. But you know that already!! On a sadder note. One of our wee group here is very poorly. She is only 34, had the same dx as I had. The treatment that I had but treatment has not worked for her. Her cancer has mets to her liver, abdomen and chest wall. She has been down to The Royal Marsden in London for advanced trials but the tumours have grown. She  is back on Herceptrin - though it stopped working for her when the cancer mover to her remaining breast - they have exhausted the repertoir of treatment for her. We are having a benefit for her tonight, we fellow travellers and families and friends, and it will be a blast. Please spare a prayer for Sharon though, she is a wonderful lass and one of the bravest people I have ever known. Lots and lots of love to each and every one one you. Nettie xxxx",

Her views, until she regains her senses, are nul and void. I take it you havent told her about your bones? OF COURSE you have to accept ALL THE HELP AND SUPPORT ON OFFER!!!! You are not abandoning Ella, you are offering her a chance to socilaise, be educated and have fun in a different environment. A challenging one which will aid her development. And after a few hours rest (REST!  YOU ARE STILL WORKING WOMAN!) you will have the energy to devote yourself to the kids. I think I know what you mean about the possibility of her losing a connection to her parents, but that is out with your control at the moment at any rate while they are immersed in a sea of selfishness!!! You can't change their behavior, they have no right to comment on your decisions. I think you are superwoman too, incidentally. Go see the infant unit, take Ella with you, let her adjust to it and try to get some Cathi time. Maybe Cathi and Ed time??? Just know we are all with you pet. Great news Judie! Life's all good now eh? The play sounds awesome.Women in the Third World are treated worse than shamefully. Female circumcision is still common in some parts of Africa and rape is a common weapon, and the resultant AIDS/HIV is a constant plague. The sad thing is that \"we\",the First World know about this but only act when \"our\" (material) interest are at stake. I will look out to see if \"Ruined\" comes to Scotalnd and will certainly catch it then. The funeral is on Saturday, in Douglas in the Scottish Borders. It has scuppered pur plans for going down south at the weekend. My brother anad his fiancee are coming up on Friday and staying with me, my cousin too. I think everyone else will be staying in Douglas (which is about 100 miles from where I live) So sad. We saw Dave's dad at the christening on 4th July and he looked ok, ill but not too bad.

Her mum can't even visit her as she has a bad cold. She was baptised early on, but her Chrisening had to be postponed due to health problems. The family will be gathering again and we are so looking forward to being together on a happy occasion! Just wish the wee yin was in full health. Prayers gratefully recieved my dear lassies.
