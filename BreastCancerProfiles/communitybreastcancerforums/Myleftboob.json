      "Content": "Apr 21, 2012 02:17AM - edited Apr 21, 2012 02:22AM by Myleftboob Hi All I just wanted to update you on my paricular RADS issue.  I had my last chemo TX yesterday and as usual on Thursday had my blood work done and meeting with the MO to review.  My regular MO was off so they had me see the SR. Mo at the hospital where I receive TX.  I was exited to meet him because I have heard nothing but good things about him from other patients. So we sit and chat for a bit while he review my file and comments that now all I have to come for TX wise is Herceptin and to pick up my Tamoxifen prescription and how I've done well with TX etc. I said well I have to come in next week to meet again with the RO do again discuss RADS.  He looked quite puzzled and read my file again.  He then said, \"who told you that you need RADS?\". I said the RO did.  He then said, \"in all my years, you are not someone I would recommend RADS for at all!\".  I did tell him that during my initial meeting with her that I question this very matter and further I couldn't see where it was indicated either.  I also told him that she was to review with the tumor board as well. He told me he is on that board but of course I know there's no way he would actually remember my file since I'm not his patient.  He wanted to know what my regular MO thought about it too.  I just said initially he never mentioned RADS but I did bring it up each visit and how he just seemed to say lets deal with one TX at a time and worry about this when we need to.  Mabey he was being politically correct and letting the RO do her thing. At the end of the day she may tell me I don't need to do it afterall. He made me laugh when he said \"I don't do politically correct!\". LOL.  Anyway, it looks like its off the table for me, very relieved.",

The chest wall and nodes were clear.  As a matter of fact my margins were fantasic.  17mm from the tumor site and 11.2 from any DCIS!  She did say she would reveiw it with the \"tumour board\".  I'm presently having my TCH TX and a decision will have to be made I would think around the end of April 2012.  She's going to have to show me some pretty compelling evidence that the benefit outweighs the risk for me to consent.  My surgeon and the MO are both of the opinion that its really up to me.  I know there no RO's but they've been around long enough I would think.  The MO is the Head of his department and I am super comfortable with him.",

I could have swore I dated these but I didn't I guess. I started taking pics about 6 weejs after TX, at about 2 week intervals. I was obsessed. Herceptin really slowed down the process. I did start ot use an amonia free dye to cover the gray though and it made the hair look fuller. The pic with the most hair is from 4/2013 2 months after H and it had really taken off.  This link takes us through about 3/2014. Had it not been for H I figure it would have taken me about a year to get back to my normal lengh. https://www.flickr.com/photos/82762094@N07/  ",

I had hair everywhere too including my food which totally grossed me out.

Im 49 right now and there's a good bit of gray but I've been colouring it since my 30's.  It will be interesting to see how much there actually is.  My only beef is having had longish hair my whole life I didn't realize what big ears I had LOL!  Edited to say \"have\".",

They drove me a little crazy all night and taking them off pulled out a few lashes.  My eyelashed and brows thinned but never totally fell out and I like others just wore some extra eyeliner and brow shadow and it did the trick.  A friend of mine that lost their Mom to colon cancer and nursed her until the end was very hesitant to visit me out of fear. We also lost a good friend 2 years ago as well. When she did her face lit up because I didn't look the way she thought I would, ie bald faced, very thin etc.",

Anyway, just about 3 weeks PFC (I love saying that!) and my hair is starting to grow.  A good bit of stubble hung in there after I had it buzzed by my hairdresser just after TX2.  Have alot of white fluff and some dark coming in mainly at the back.  Where it went smooth along the hairline is starting to get sprouts too.  I had a bit of stubble fall out last week as evidenced by my lint roller but hopefully that has passed.  My eyebrows kind of hung in there but yesterday I noticed my right brow has lost a bit more.  Learning to pencil in at the LGFB class helped alot.  I also put a little bit of dark brown eyeshadow to set it and it has worked well. I start the H train alone this Friday but and I've read that it can slow growth but I figure I've getting getting H all along so I'm a little hopefull. I love seeing the pics of all of the people that are getting some really good hair growth, its very encouraging!!",

So finished that last week and my nice 1 inch or so of regrowth is going with the wind (litterally). My scalp is quite red and itchy and it feels the same when I was on Taxol 5 years ago. That all being said, does anyone know if I can start using Nigoxin once everything settles down with my scalp in like a month?",

I got a great deal from a friend who works for a distributor up here $35 for a huge shampoo and conditioner. I used it as well right after chemo in 2012 and right through Herceptin. I think it helped but H kept the growth at a snails pace. Once that was done though it was off to the races. My a year and a half my hair was what you see in my pic. I did a different chemo cocktail though this time around and the hair got really thin but it didn't all fall out. My MO was kind of amazed. Finally though about a month after I was done I cut all the longer strands off it looked so haggish. This time though with radiation II just don't want to irritate my scalp if I use it too early. I'm practically bald again after 10 TX and I didn't even finish a week ago. Sore and itchy like a sunburn. I have a great wig but they really are uncomfortable. The 2nd I;m in the door off it comes. Much like I did before. I've left the same question for the ladies on the brain mets thread which I feel weird asking such a vain question in light of their DX but I know the majority have had full brain radiation. I know this is really a chemo thread I just that perhaps someone might have gone through the same TX. They've been so helpful though with all my rad related questions for sure. I almost forgot about the BIotin though. I did take that the last go around. thanks for the reminder! Bow1965. Wowsa that's a good head of hair! DaraB Yeah it was quite a shock to me for sure. I thought I was having an allergic reaction to something my face and neck were totally swollen. Went to the local ER and the doc suspected liver mets and wanted me to come back for a CT scan (they had done an ultrasound). I decided the following day to call my MO at a different hospital and he told me to come in through the ER there. The ER doc took one look at me and said a liver issue of any kind woudn't cause this and that it had to be my chest, CT'd me and I had a 7cm tumor on my heart blocking the blood from flowing back down like it's supposed to. The consider it lung mets though. They're were some minor liver mets which I guess was a blessing were noticed but truly I could hav suffered a fatal heart attack had I not called my MO. He said it was a miracle I didn't arrest. So at least I was treated for both and had a full response. Now scans every 3 months The only thing I can add to anyone dealing with hair loss and regrowth is lots of protien, tons of water, nioxin, and time. If meat isn't going down so well (it didn't for me during chemo either). Chia puddings are quite nice and easy to make and no cook. (tons of recipes on Pinterest. Eggs, Protien shakes (stay away from Soy Based ones though if your ER+). beans, chicken and fish",

Not a ton of taste until you add salt IMHO but makes a great base for soup or gravey and you know exactly what's in it. Add a little apple cider vinigar too which draws out even more of the collagen apparently from the bones too.  Re hair, happy to report I'm feeling fuzz on previously smooth as a baby's butt areas!

It really hung in there I have to say but once I was done in October, it started coming out alot. I looked pretty haggish. Some long, some just growing back. I cut the long strands myself and was getting good growth over the next 6 weeks all over. Alas I had to do brain rads and once that was done in only 2 weeks, the rest went. I was told to expect at least 3 months to expect anything IF at all. So actually Thursday is exactly 3 months so at least something's coming in now.  Bravepoint. That's great news on the wigs. I'll call for sure. Nylon works for me. I'd like a shorter one actually.",

I was where you were last October but only found this site in December.  Wish I would have found it sooner.  dmacw is right, alot of these are B9 and I pray that's what's found for you!  Waiting for tests IS the hardest part believe me.  Try not to read too too much on the internet OK.  You will freak yourself out even more.  Stay as busy as you possibly can and make sure you have someone go to your appointments even just for moral support. People here really do care. (((HUGS)))",

Its really is patient/diagnosis/doctor specific.   I was 48 when my GP suggested a routine mammogram, no history, no symptoms, no problem. Through this my BC was found and the surgery, chemo happened in a whirlwind.  In my case no Oncotype test though because HER+ trumps it, therefore chemo was necessary.  Universal  healthcare is not the scary monster some would make it out to be. It really isn't as bad as people think.  Unless of course you talk to those that profit off of private health care.   I've had nothing but excellent care quite honestly, very aggresive even more so than I would have hoped.",

You are all an inspiration to me.",

It might sound very strange but its true.  I start Herceptin on Friday and praying it doesn't slow it down too much.  Then again I've been getting Herceptin all along right?!",

Long story short I met with her at the beginning of the process in January after my MX.  Of course she recommends radiation but we will meet again after I finish chemo to discuss further as she wants to present my case to the tumor board first regardless.  I finish chemo on April 20th and meet with her on the 26th.  Of course since January I have had alot of time to research and nowhere can I find where its indicated with my pathology including NCCN (I'm in Canada).  So we meet and she hasn't presented my case and still wants me to do RADS because of my HER status, grade and tumor location \"near the chest wall\".  I correct her and tell her they were centrally located.  \"oh you're right\".  Says she also wants to talk to my surgeon, has the wrong surgeon's name.   I correct her.  I come right out and ask her if she can point to a study or Canadian guideline where RADS would be indicated?  \"no\".  I felt like asking her what she was smoking or if she had the correct file. She ends the meeting with \"I'm glad you read\"?  So once again she says she will present to the board and we are to meet again in a week.  I already know what my MO and the Sr MO's opinion are (no rads) along with my surgeon (no Rads).  I don't have alot of faith in this doctor to make a decision to save her life.  BTW I'm not doing rads but wanted to give her the courtesy of listening to what her opinion was along with the rest of the board.",

Although, I can't say I would feel the same way with a lumpectomy though in all honesty.",
