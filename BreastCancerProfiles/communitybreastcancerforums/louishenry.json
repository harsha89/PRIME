Dcis needs to be under 5mm, no necrosis, grades 1-2. Second, and probably most imp. are margins. I believe to enter the no rads zone, margins need to be close to a centimeter. That's tough to do in some cases. Grade one with really close margins may  have a higher recurrence than grade 3 with  1 cent. margins. Google the VNPI index. It includes age in the guideline. I was also only 45 at the time, but there rest of the numbers were low, so I was still in the guideline of rads not necessarily making a difference in survival. I am on tamox. It's ok. My risk assessment was about 6% recurrence in 10 years. Rads would lower than to about 3%. Tamox another bit. I went to three rad onc and they all said not a great benefit. Try the tamox. They can't all be wrong, I guess. I live in a large city Chicago. and went to docs from large breast centers. Good luck, Nada",

I'm sorry about your mom. It's hard when everything falls apart at once. I had DCIS last May and am on tamox right now. It's not a problem at all, other than I don't menstruate. If you need anything, just ask. Nada",

It is a non-invasive disease that does not biolologically know how to metastisize.However, to avoid a recurrance that may be dcis or worse, you need to treat it properly. Sometimes if the dcis is all over the place, a woman may not have much of a choice. Mastectomy it is. However, most have lumpectomy with rads, and in some cases like myself, the dcis was so little, low grade, large margins etc, no rads are needed. But , we are all different. There are some that want a mast. because they don't want rads or tamox. I respect their decision. But,pure dcis is not going to hurt you. Even with microinvasion, they will probably treat it as stage 1a, which is the earliest of the invasive numbers. With a family history, I would understand if you wanted a mast. But, you really need to think this through. So, take a deep breath and try to get all the info you need to make the best decision you can. You have time. Nada",

All of us newbies get a lot of support here. I don't know your details yet, but as soon as you post, we will be here. I was (still am, but a little less) freaked after my dx. I wanted a double mast asap! But as time went on , my dx got a little more favorable and now I consider myself incredibly lucky that the radiologist wasn't asleep that day. I don't like taking tamox (I don't have se's), but you may not even need to. Shirlann is right. Pure dcis is not life threatening; you will be ok. Nada. Also, make sure you ask about stage, type of cells they see, one spot or several,  margins after your lumpectomy (REALLY IMP), and  micro- invasion.",
