The sonogram did find something so i'm waiting to get a biopsy a week from now. This whole process has taken a real toll on me and i'm inexplicably worried. The biopsy itself sounds scary and i'm not looking forward to that but i know the sooner, the better. Can anyone give me feedback on the biopsy procedure and any advice to calm my nerves? -ash Log in to post a reply",

Irr4993: it does seem weird you were more stressed waiting for the results but then again to actually find out what it was and not be in the dark may have been a relief though it wasn't the ideal outcome. I really appreciate your feedback. Marie5890: Good point on the sports bra, i wouldn't have thought of that. Any bit helps! I'm sure i'm working myself up over nothing as you've confirmed the images are worse than the procedure itself. Karenlen: Thank you for confirming the painless procedure. I'm not AS worried though i guess it's human nature to worry about things like this. I don't intend on looking as that might freak me out more. Thanks for mentiong the fact you were able to drive afterwards. That helps :)",

Honestly, i'm already feeling a lot better because even if the results do come back not in my favor, i'll have so much support and women to talk to here. I'm still at a loss for words at how caring and supportive you woman are. Thank you so much, really. Shelleyj43: Thanks so much for the warning about the vacuum sound. That definitley would have scared me and made me jump.Â  Jo1955: Thanks for mentioning the fact that it only takes a bandaid and no stiches. Charley: I really appreciate your support. You're right, i shouldn't worry too much before getting any results. I'm the stubborn type that pushes health issues off but as worried as i am, i know i'm making the right choice in getting the tests done early.",

I wish i could remember the name of the tumor, i know it started with an \"F\" but it can continue to grow. I have an appointment with a breast surgeon in march to talk about removing it. I'm relieved it is not cancer but still worried about the fact that i have this tumor and have to wait until the middle of march to find out if i nee surgery (which i've never had befor)",
