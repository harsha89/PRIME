I went from a DDD cup size to a C. I noticed a BB sized lump in my right breast just above the areola a few weeks ago. It is right below the surface. I went to my Dr who scheduled me for a mammogram and an U/s. The mammogram also showed another larger mass in my right breast. The radiologist was on site and was present for my u/s. She said that the larger mass (I cant feel it) was a simple cyst and the smaller BB mass is a micro cluster cyst. She recommended i come back in 6,months unless anything changes. Yesterday I noticed another BB sized mass in my left breast this time. It is in the exact same spot as the BB sized mass on the right breast. Its small but i didn't notice it before. Its a few days before ny cycle is due to start so im not sure if it grew with my cycle. I just had a breast exam by my dr 3 weeks ago and she didnt feel it nor did it show up on my mammogram. I am going to be calling my Dr tomorrow to see what she says. The radiologist had mentioned that you dont nornally feel these cluster cysts and that many women have them and dont know it, She believed i am only feeling them now because I have lost a large amount of breast volume from my weight loss. I am wondering if anyone has had the same experiences as I am having? Thanks for reading! Log in to post a reply",
