I tried that and it works better but still not great. Guess I was breathing heavy or fast one day. Tech asked to try to breathe softer.....easy to say since she's not about to receive radiation.

It's hard to keep busy because all we think about is the next appointment. I remember waking up at 5am after only falling asleep at 2....which only my my time thinking about the dx longer. So this will probably be the worse weekend and then each will get a little bit better. Like all the ladies tell you, once you have a plan you focus on that. Maybe go to your sister's house to break up the day. For me, I cried only at home. I wish I could give you a hug and tell you my surgery was only last month but I feel so much better than that first weekend after dx. I promise YOU will too! ",

I mentioned to RO this week how I feel nervous that I still feel it and he said he would do a bone scan anytime. I know since being dx, I've being sitting and reading A LOT....PROBABLY TOO MUCH about BC. I'm sure the sitting around all day and bad posture and now the hard rad table hasn't helped my back but I do worry what if.....though I'm too nervous to actually get the scan to find out. I am going to try the massage the hospital has avaliable for patients at the fabulous rate of $56 for a hour. Tried the free 15 minute sample masage today.

My older sister was dx in 2008 with dcis. She did radiation no tamoxifen. It returned this June She did genenic testing this time and told me and my other sister all negative and probably we won't have to worry about family history. Not so, I was dx December and it rocked my world. No family history before this. I still can't believe I have bc too. I'm happy that radiation will be over on 3/8 but sad our group will be over. I'm going to take the plunge and pop the tamoxifen in when finished with rads. My sister didn't so I feel I have to. Stinks that we all have no win decisions. It's been in the 70s in Boston the last 3 days. Snow is gone! I should be outside but this darn giraffe has me hooked Xoxo",

My last 2 were like my first 2. I know I felt OK this it it....has it worked...is this the last time ...is this darn caner coming back.....am I cured? I guess we worked so hard to get to that final appointment then it's sorta OK you're on your own.....good luck. I just wish we knew what happened inside our bodies that made those cells go rogue. Unfortunately we never will. All we can do is BELIEVE we will never have to have a crappy holiday/new years like 2016! I had a minnie ornament whose ear broke off. I didn't put her on the tree. When I was packing up the decorations my husband said did you glue minnie. I said no. He said go get your glue gun and fix her ear so next Christmas when we put up the tree minnie will be fixed just like you! Love to all",

One week on tamoxifen and I really haven't noticed any changes. Some mornings my bad knee seems a little more stiff but not sure I can blame the pill. I feel really alone taking this since I don't see my MO until 5/4 and wasn't told abut any supplements to take with it. Those boost must deliver a punch because I can still feel that zingers from time to time and I finished 10 days ago. Actually felt more discomfort since ending than I did during actual treatment. HAPPY SPRING!",
