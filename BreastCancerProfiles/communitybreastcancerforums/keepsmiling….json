I have a family history of bc- my mother is a survivor. I put mine off because I was afraid (bad choice, I know). Anyway, I was told that callbacks are normal for your baseline but I was convinced that I wouldn't be called back (and if I was called back I thought that there was something very wrong). Well, I was and I was a mess. To make a long story short, I was given a breast ultrasound and the radiologist was 99.9% positive that what they saw was a fibroadenoma (B9), but because of my family history I should also have an MRI to see everything (I have very dense breasts). It was scary, but at least they were being thorough. I had the MRI- it showed the same results and nothing more and I was referred to a surgeon. He suggested I have it taken out, so I did, they biopsied it and it was only a fibroadenoma. Thank God! So, I just want you to know that even though it seems like your world is turning upsidedown right now, it should all work out fine. You are smart to be proactive. Trust me, I was a mess. Couldn't eat, I was researching CONSTANTLY and I dreamt about it. Please have positive thoughts and don't be afraid to ask questions. Take care- I'll pray for you!",
