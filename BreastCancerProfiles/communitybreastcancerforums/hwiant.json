I had a lumpectomy to remove a 2cm cancer and 3 lymph nodes, then had a PET scan  which was clear,  followed by chemo and radiation. A little over a year later, I had an MRI at the recommendation of radiologist because I have dense breast tissue. The MRI found 2 identical (1.2 cm) very slow growing cancers, one in each breast, which they are pretty certain were there from the beginning. So the PET scan probably didn't find them becuase it only finds cancers that are metabolically active. I decided to get a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction and all is well now, even though surgeon had been worried about implants in a previously radiated breast. Taking Arimidex, following anti-cancer diet, and feel great.",
