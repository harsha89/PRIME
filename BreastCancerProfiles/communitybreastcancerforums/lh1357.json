I have tried reaching out to others like me on other sites and no one responds. I feel alone in this thing. I'm quite scared. How long does surgery last when reconstruction is done. Is the pain afterwards manageable. Will I need some one to care fore me and for how long. Because I'm working up to the day of surgery I'm unable to go to any classes to prepare myself. Can some one please enlighten me... Log in to post a reply",
