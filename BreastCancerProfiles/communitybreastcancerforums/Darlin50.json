They fell out again 2 months later and started growing back right away, again it took 6 -8 weeks. My lower left lashes just fell out again 4 month later but are growing back again. I didn't mind losing the lower ones so much (eye liner maskes that), but losing the upper ones twice was a real bummer. Headcovers.com has some real natural looking false eyelashes that are priced right and easy to apply (after a few trys). They got me thru the rough times. The good news is that they do come back and thicker than before!",
