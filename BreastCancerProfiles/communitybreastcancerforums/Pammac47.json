However I have one thing that's more than annoying. I do have pain in breast and lymphedema including extreme tingling in fingers. There's is swelling under arm, as well. I showed radiologist and they took US pictures of axillary area when did bx. I have not heard of this prior to surgery. it doesn't effect doing stuff, but it's always there. Anyone? Is there anything natural I can do to help also?",

I have been told pain is cause it's growing. Anyway I am now set to not only see the surgeon, but an onocologist and a radiologist on Tuesday the 16th. I'm scared, yes. The size, how quick it got there, and the new things going on with my body are all weighing on my mind. However there is one true comfort, I am not alone. Someone has been in my shoes. So many had to go before me for new treatments to be found. So my life is changing and I have fear, I cry because I am not done living, but know I have to fight to continue. Maybe someday we can find a cure, so my daughter never has to go through this. Or any of our daughters, sons or grandkids for that matter. By the way all I've been told is that Adenocarcinoma grade 3. We know 5cm+, but understand that could change",

Upon further investigating they did and I got my answer. It's insulting to those folks who were so terribly kind to me when I was at hospital, that I would let this reduce me to that. Shame on me, while they wouldn't release info to me. They did send to my pcp. I owe them a debt of apology and thanks-central florida regional and sincerely hope to never repeat that ugliness again.

Found lump in Dec 2015. Diagnostic mammo shows a very large lump and my lymph node is swollen. I was trying to say be vigilant and do any follow up testing they recommend. I'm unsure if it would have made any difference to me, but wouldn't be going what if. Anyway I don't even have my own answers yet. Next is my ultrasound guided core biopsy.",

Don't let it consume you, live life, deal with facts not unknowns. Good Luck and I hope all goes well. It sounds like life is good for you enjoy that!!",

There is a heightened anxiety level around the unknown for some this persists beyond getting a positive outcome. If you have recently experienced the loss of someone close from cancer as well as going through your own diagnosis process. Some have what we used to term \"survivors guilt\". I don't know but a doctor might be best suited to allay your fears and perhaps determine if you need something for anxiety, please do take care of yourself, and seek help if necessary",
