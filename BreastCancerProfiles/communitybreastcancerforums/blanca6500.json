I have a check up in a month just for precautionary measures, but she did advice me that if the rash grows or gets worse to not wait until the check up and go in sooner. I am hoping it goes away soon and I do feel much better now that I got a professional to examine the rash. Thank you both, I will keep you updated. ",
