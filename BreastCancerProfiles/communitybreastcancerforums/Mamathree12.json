Had an ultrasound, they could see nothing. Met with a surgeon and had it removed it was a golf ball sized fibroadenoma. Fast forward to last year. Another lump roughly in the same spot. This go around I had a bilateral mammogram for a baseline and an ultrasound all came back \"normal\" for both sides. So we left it be, fast forward and a new provider later and I was beginning to have pain in that same breast so another mammogram and ultrasound ordered (roughly 6months between them). All came back \"normal\". Spoke to a different surgeon who recommended we do a contrast MRI because I have pretty dense tissue. Go and get the MRI an drew right side where im having \"symptoms\" is all good and normal...here's where things get interesting. My left breast has a very small non palpable lump. So I am called in for an ultrasound and boom no problem finding a tiny lump. My concern is they are telling me it's \"probably the same\" as the fibroadenoma but with the golfball sized one they couldn't see anything and now with this teeny tiny thing it popped up no problem with ultrasound. They said we'll see how it goes in 6months. Any insight would be appreciated:) Thanks :) Log in to post a reply",
