I also chose double MX because I knew that I did NOT want radiation (other choice being another lumpectomy to get better margins & radiation) for a variety of reasons, and that bilateral MX would give me a better chance of symmetry in reconstruction...as would no prior radiation... Hope that helps explain my personal decision to have BOTH breasts removed.",

I don't sit around & constantly worry if/when it might come back--please understand. Not my personality . I've had so many surgeries in my life, lost a baby to SIDS 26 years ago, had 2 miscarriages, adopted a special needs child, & recently weathered a horrendous break up of my 20+ year marriage/family due to my husband going off the deep end into unspeakable addiction ...I could go on & on...but I won't. All this to say that I take most things in relative stride now: It is what it is. I think I've become unshockable! When I found out I had BC last Nov., it was ON my birthday. The excisional lumpectomy revealed IDC tumor in R breast next to those suspicious calcification clusters.  I was a bit teary, but never freaked out. I wasn't surprised, even though the ster. biopsy said it was only severe atypical ductal hyperplasia... Even though the radiologist & docs figured it was \"probably nothing to worry about\"...UM, NOT. And then they also found the IDC in my L. breast during BMX. I've had a lot of time now to process since the beginning of my 1st bad mammo. & soooo many biopsies!/tests/surgeries. I've honestly been pretty much at peace the entire time. Like I tell people that ask me why/how I'm doing \"so well\" w/ knowing I have BC: What are ya gonna do? And why not me? It's LIFE. That doesn't mean I haven't cried over it at times or lost sleep over it--I have. But, I just have this peace about it. And you are right, we have to go on living & have hope we WILL indeed have a long fruitful LIFE. I'm grateful for sooo many small things now. I take way less forgranted. I do not wake up in fear & dread. I'm sure what has helped me most is the loving support/prayers of friends/family/my-new-\"beau\"(guy). And if I didn't have my FAITH in God, I don't know where I'd be. He has carried me through it all. i.e.-The fabulous medical specialists/centers I've had with zero insurance problems--it stuns me. No infections, no complications SO FAR.  I guess what I meant before was that I STILL have a gut feeling the BC will come back...NOT that it is necessarily going to kill me or even become stage 4...but that I'm not done w/ it. And, I'm the kind of girl who wants to know ALL of the what-if's/worse-case-scenarios so I am prepared if they do happen. This helps me--to research-the-shet-outta stuff . It doesn't make me dwell on the what-if's, but helps me know what could happen, so I'll be emotionally prepared. p.s. - I have read a few posts from women on this site who have quickly gone from stage 1 to stage 3 or 4 and my heart goes out to them. Mostly, I'm in awe of them for their bravery & wonderful attitude; I marvel at their fortitude & grace. And I know that IF I find myself in their shoes some day, I'll have some wonderful women to go to. THIS website is so comprehensive, it continually amazes me in it's span & scope. God bless the Moderators!!!! I'd love to know the history behind this group...perhaps it's on the website already. ****Sorry this got so long. I hope I didn't overshare. Thanks for being here on this thread to help others... MOI",

I had my first \"bad\" mammogram 2012 (suspicious cluster calcifications on my R breast), followed by a stereotactic biopsy that read severe atypical hyperplasia/Borderline DCIS. Well. I followed that w/ a lumpectomy which found a 0.5 cm tumor, IDC Grade/Stage 1a/+E./P. receptors (90%). They didn't quite get clean margins, so after MUCH thought and after suspicious hot spots on my L severely dense breast via MRI, I decided that a bilateral MX was best. THANK GOD I had the dang bilateral mastectomy & listened to my gut! They found the same deal in my L breast! My lymph node was clear on my R. breast also (SNB), so no chemo or radiation--yay! They felt good about my L breast lymph nodes, but didn't do a SNB on them because we didn't know I had a cancer in my L breast prior to MX. *My BRACA tests came back negative--. Other Treatment:  I have another consult with a breast oncologist soon...my MX oncologist surgeon feels that tamoxifen would not necessarily be a given for me, as the risk vs. % it might help is iffy. They DID immediately take me off BC pills which I've taken for years for hideous periods/fibroids. So, I have many OB/GYN type decisions to make still: Do I want to take Tamoxifen? What do I want to try to control/help my bleeding now that I'm off the pill? What about ovary suppression/removal surgery? Will I most likely just need a darn hysterectomy to address all of those issues? Interestingly, I've seen an OB/GYN oncologist who would prescribe/perform any of these treatments, BUT the BREAST oncologists are the experts that I must crunch the #'s with to help decide which treatments would be most beneficial for me. I also have 2 aunts w/ got low grade breast cancer in their 70's/80's, and one had uterine cancer in her 70's. I had an endometrial biopsy that came back negative a few weeks ago--yay! Anyone else w/ a similar situation to mine? Thanks!",

      "Content": "May 3, 2013 05:16AM - edited May 3, 2013 05:19AM by violet_1 I'm just catching back up on this thread...SIGH. I have not had the Onco score...I think my oncologist breast surgeon said it wasn't necessary in my case. He DID take my final pathology to the Tumor Board...my understanding that Tami wouldn't be of much benefit vs. the risks... I think I've just had so much info...I forget what-the-hell I was told sometimes...;)I LOVE my breast surgeon--he's easy to talk to and gave me his cell # to call anytime...:) I just REALLY don't WANT to take Tamoxifen unless absolutely warranted(/SE's & risks)...which it doesn't appear to be. TONS of reasons for that...I can expand more on that later--it's very late & I should be in bed!!! Regardless, I have an appoint. with another Breast Oncologist May 20th to get a second opinion... I also really believe BC patients can NEVER be certain that they are \"cancer free\"...NED just means they don't have any evidence presently of cancer. I KNOW my Bilateral MX doesn't make me 100 % cancer-free. AND, from my understanding, I'm in double-trouble because they found I had BILATERAL BREAST CANCER @ at the MX-- they found same on my L side....twice the fun & twice possible for recurrance, right? Yee-Haw! It Sucks. AND, I'm not sure WHY, but I feel in my gut, it's going to come back, and I'm not one to normally feel the worst is gonna happen--at all. BUT, I had the strongest gut feeling before my MX that they would indeed find BC on my other super-dense breast even though it never showed up on ANY imaging...and it DID. So. There-you-go. However, I feel it's probably going to come back regardless if I take Tamoxifen or not. I'm not sure HOW to explain how I feel. It's not a defeatist attitude. I've been strong & at great peace through this whole ordeal & I have a really strong Faith in God/supportive family/friends/great medical care...and ironically, I'm at a really happy time in my life (going through divorce from 25+ yr. marriage, but met a wonderful man 1 year ago who has been super supportive through ALL of my cancer ordeal .) I just feel like it's coming back...some how/some way and it's not uncommon for it to recur. I don't mean that as a downer for anyone else...I'm just being honest about how I feel for me. YET. I feel at peace with whatever is going to be. And, I want to do what I can within reason, that which might help me (hence, the BMX)...if the rewards outweigh the potential side effects... Hope this makes sense tomorrow...it's past 2:00 a.m. I'd welcome any comments from others--especially on how YOU feel about YOUR cancer situation... Blessings--I've learned soooo much from you ALL!!!",

I didn't really care about drug test since I had nothing to hide, but I am so \"green\" new to this it was weird for me. I live in a very small county & this is the ONLY pain clinic so I'm sure this office gets 90% druggies. I had been taking Norco only so far & I know it's not good to take it for so long at 20mg. every 4-6 hours. This new doc put me on VERY low dose Kamden? 10 mg /Morphine class 2 x day and told me I can take the Norco I have left (only 50 10mg. pills!) for break through pain. The idea is to lessen the amount of Norco. She also wants me to start the Neurontin the other doc. gave me. I'm really hesitating that cuz I'm worried about the fatigue/depression/blurry vision SE's. BUT they are starting it very low dose increasing it every 3days until I'm on 3 pulls a day...still low dose. BUT, I'm not starting it until AFTER the long weekend! Sigh... So far, the Kamden is ok...but way too LOW of a dose. They purposely start u out low. What I did notice is that when I do need the Norco, I can get by w way less & less frequently...;) So that's good! HOWEVER, there's no way I will have enough Norco for 30 damn days!!!!!!! ****The DEAL at this clinic is that you can ONLY get appointments & med changes/refills at the monthly next appointment! No exceptions. I'm sure this is to prevent druggies from trying to get early refills. So, I'll have to try and conserve Norco like crazy. Also, I had to sign agreement that I can only pick 1 pharmacy and only get pain meds from this one clinic. Thing is the CVS I went to barely had enough 10 mg Kamden at their pharmacy cuz they carry the normal way higher doses--even the 30 mg they had had expired! Normal mg they carry are 60/100 mg. So, pharmacy said the clinic will have to call them ahead of time so they can ORDER the low dose next time. Anyway, I'd love anyone's input/experience here. The doc. DID say/confirm I have PMPS/ nerve pain, so THAT is good. But, she isn't specialized in BC per se. She did mention trying Fentanyl patches later, methadone, and nerve blocks as options. What PISSED ME OFF though is she went on and on about patients such as myself w a history of depression/anxiety experience pain much more acutely and that I had to do my part--blah blah. Anyway, I'll see how it goes...I tild her my concern of the Neurontin worsening depression & the fatgue issue...she daud its a small % the depression part...huge eyeroll... OY!!!!! Violet",
