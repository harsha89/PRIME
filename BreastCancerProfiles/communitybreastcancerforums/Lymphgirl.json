The pain in that area has been there since radiation.  I'm on gabapentin, anti inflammatory creams to rub on the breast and tylenol #3s at the moment. The sleep doc tried to put me on Cymbalta for my apnea, nerve pain and I reacted drastically to it. We even tried to cut the small dose in half - and still had issues. I need to be on tamoxifen, couldn't survive the AI's, but Onc wanted me to work on getting my apnea in control first. I'm just tired of being in a brain fog and soon as I start exercising - the pain keels me over. After 2 years, you would think there would be some relief. Pain Management doc seems to think at this point, this pain is here to stay unless we take further measures to deal with it.",

I also have Lymphedema in the breast. Walking makes the pain worse also. Someone mentioned yoga or tai chi.  I have lost alot of my flexibility, so not sure which would even be possible. Does anyone have experience with either of these?  Help please. Dx IDC, 1cm, Stage IB, Grade 2, 1/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
