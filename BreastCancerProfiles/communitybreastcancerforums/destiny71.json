Scheduled for mastectomy 10th January 2013 I will be joining a few of you both in trying to get through december without cancer ruling my life, and in the surgery itself. Waiting has been incredibly hard this far and I was extremely angry at having to wait for so long... I suppose it give me time to get everything organised, I have found advice on shopping for bra's and other essentials ... why is it surgeons do not explain the small stuff, when it is actually sooo important ...  thanks to the survivors who take the time out to help newbies prepare for the long road ahead",
