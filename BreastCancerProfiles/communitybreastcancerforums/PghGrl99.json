She is going to have 8 chemo treatments (She had her port put in and started friday 1 week ago and will continue every 3 weeks), a radical mastectomy, and radiation to follow.  Her first round of chemo was very hard on her.  Could barely get out of bed.  Hardly ate anything the first 3 days.  They have her on several naseau medications but didn't seem to help much.  They have 2 young sons who don't really understand. We know this is going to be a long battle for her thank god she has our family for support!! Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks, Lil Sis",
