    "Content": "Sep 27, 2007 09:00AM - edited Sep 27, 2007 09:00AM by LynneC Diane I also had IDC & DCIS clear margins, node negative, er and pr positve, Her2-,grade 2. 43 and premenopausal. After my lumpectomy, my surgeon suggested the Oncotype dx test (after my oncologist suggested chemo, radiation, tamoxifen). It's for er and pr positve tumors, with clear margins. They test the tumor and tell you the chance of recurrence in 10 yrs. My score came back 12, which means that my chance of recurrence is 8%. Because of this test, I decided to opt out of chemo. Chemo would have only given me another 3% (down to 5%). 92% of it NOT coming back was good enough for me.  I had 6 weeks of radiation and  am now on a Aromotase inhibitor after deciding to have a complete hysterectomy (ovaries, cervix, uterus, everything) after radiation. It's been 2 1/2 yrs now and other than the side effects from the AI, life pretty much is back to normal (aside from all these extra doctor's appts!). You can get through this! Hugs and prayers",
