She is doing pretty well now and actually is just back from a holiday. She hasn't been around much lately although she has always been one of the most helpful members on these forum. She has been active off the internet too to help those with this disease. I will contact her and see if she can help you.                 Hugs, Fumi",

By the way Pip, I just read your first post. Did your cancer specialist really told you that large masses are more likely to spread??? If that's true, then I would recommend you to seek for a second opinion and look for another doctor. Any doctors that don't understand what their patients are going through, how they feel and unnecessarily scare them are not good doctors, in my opinion. It's gonna be a long journey so you really have to make sure you are treated by a real good doctor who respects you and your feelings. As for how to cope with the waiting game, well I don't have the word of wisdom. That's the worst part of this journey. Just try to keep you busy and don't look for the medical information. When I was diangnosed, I googled like crazy for the information but anything only looked terrifying. Instead, come here often and seek for support. We are all here to listen. Hugs,",

I was diagnosed with IDC in July of 2005 and my tumor was more than 3.5cm. It was stage IIb cancer because MRI's confirmed 2 positive lymph nodes at the diagnosis. As soon as I finished with the tests (biopsy, MRI's, CT's and bone scan), I started neoadjuvant chemo. I ended up doing 2 different types of chemo, Taxol and EC, which took 6 months. Believe me, my tumor was only measured 0.8cm and those positive nodes were completely gone when I was done with chemo. I had a lumpectomy in March of 2006 and went on to rads and have been on Tamoxifen and Lupron shot (both are hormone therapy) for almost two years now. I know exactly how you are feeling right now as I was in the same boat. But hey, I am still here, alive and kicking. I work full time, have got my hair 100% back and am enjoying both bad and good hair days. In May of last year, I even went on holidays to Australia and met with my best friend. Yes, I have been fully enjoying my life just like I was before this disease. So rest assured, you will be just fine.  PM me anytime if you want to talk. I will keep you close in my thoughts. Hugs,",

We were all the same when we were diagnosed. When we were told that we had cancer, we all thought it was the death sentence and barely remembered what else was said in the meeting. The pill your Dr. told you to take for the next 5 years is either one of those AI's (Aromatase Inhibitors) or Tamoxifen, depending on whether you are post-memopausal or pre-memopausal. It was recommended because your ER/PR (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor) status was positive. ER/PR positive breast cancer has a lot to do with the amount of the production of estrogen in your body and to lower the amount or to block the action lowers the risk of your cancer coming back. Here's the link for further information.  http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/hormonal/                  If you can get someone to go with you to the meeting with your Dr., let them take the note for you. What they say is not always easy to remember regardless of whether you are upset or not. Or you can bring a tape recorder so you will be able to listen to the whole meeting over and over. Don't try to be a good patient for the Dr. and make sure you ask whatever you want and everything gets answered. There's no such a thing as a silly question. Just keep asking and make them repeat themselves until you feel confident. I am glad your cancer was caught early. Come back often and keep us updated.              Hugs, Fumi",

I'm not sure what type of biopsy (surgical or needle) she had but needle biopsy can miss a tumor and take a sample of normal tissue instead, even with the ultrasound guidance like they did for me. It is always good to have backup with regard to checking on a medical opinion since doctors can be wrong in their diagnosis - two heads are always better than one.

      "Content": "Jan 15, 2012 10:40PM - edited Jan 15, 2012 10:44PM by nowheregirl         I could organize this and put it all together. I have 20+ years experience of working at a commercial printing company as a sales consultant as well as a graphic/website designer. I know everything about printing and making websites. I am a self-taught geek and I also know how to make things actually happen. As some of you know well, I have already done a few projects here -  an online picture forum for those are going through reconstructions or with chemo hair, an online address book mainly for those of you with stage IV BC to share their contact information, a few video clips for those needed special encouragement/prayers etc. In fact, I did something similar to this a few years ago for the girls I met here. We were all doing chemo at the same time and needed some kind of tool that would help us know each other better. I made a 50+ pages booklet for home print (not for publishing) and made it donwloadable. You can see a small part of it here if you want. http://tkt.hostned.ws/luv/booklet.pdf The only problem is that it's the busiest season of the year at my work and it will last till the end of April. I could barely get much time doing anything but work. So if everyone could wait until after April, I could help. It can be good for y'all in some way - you can get enough time thinking, writing/drawing, getting things ready etc and email me your stuff, then I will start working after my busiest season is over. Specifically speaking, I think POD is the way to go. There are many services that take digital files, turn them into high-quality paperback or hardback books and ship them to you. From what I googled, Lulu.com and Blurb.com are two major POD companies. First, we will have to decide how many copies we actually need. I think the best way is that we only order as many as people who really want to buy the copy. Second, see how much it really costs to get the copies printed. Third, if we are assured that the cost can be covered by donations, we can actually start working on this. Those who want to be a part of this email me their stuff, I will put it together and create an account with one of those POD services and make the digital data that meets their requirements. At this point, I will certainly need someone else who can take care of receiving the copies and shipping each of them individually to those ordered because I don't reside in the U.S. Once it's all done, those who ordered can pay for the shipping to the person who handles it via check or PayPal. If we ever get more people than we ordered the copies for, the POD services I mentioned - like Lulu.com or Blurb.com - will sell our book for us. We won't have to worry about marketing. If someone hears about our book and want the copy after the first copies were printed, then they can buy it online. This time, no one will have to handle the shipping. Our book will be printed on-demand as the buyers order it and shipped directly to those buyers by the POD company at no cost to us. We can decide the price and even make donations to BC.org or anybody we want if we ever make any $$ out of this. That all being said, I don't have the time for this right now, like I said already. Isn't there anyone who is willing to be a part of a \"committee\" that takes care of #1) actually take orders and see how many copies we need #2) take donations and see how much we can raise #3) see how many can actually contribute an article, poem, drawing #4) collect some of special quotes from Zoh's posts etc? Also, is there anyone who is willing to be a recipient of the copies and handle the shipping?  Oh and most importantly, is everyone OK with letting me do this?    Fumi aka nowheregirl (former Timtam)   ",

Hi everyone, I'm not sure if you all know but our friend Kathy (Katz03, Sarah's mom) should be somewhere in my country. She came here for holidays on the 1st with her sons (not Sarah this time) and was supposed to go home yesterday (our time). However due to a huge typhoon, most airlines have shut down since Friday so I guess she's still here. I am afraid that she had to spend a night at the airport. Please keep her in your thoughts and send her good wishes.

Of course I have no regret for having done this but there're two things I would have done if I had known more about this. Have you ever heard of the Oncotype DX test and an SNB (Sentinel Node Biopsy)? The Oncotype DX test provides an individual, numerical assessment of how likely your breast cancer is to return but only available for those with early stage breast cancer whose tumor is estrogen receptor-positive and lymph node-negative. Here's the official link. http://www.genomichealth.com/oncotype/default.aspx An SNB is a method to detect whether any cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. Blue dye and/or a radioactive material are injected into the breast and will travel to the first or \"sentinel\" node that would normally receive lymph fluid from the area of the breast containing the cancer. Once you have done chemo before you have surgery, you or doctors will never be 100% sure if your node was positive or not in the first place because chemo does work for nodes too. I didn't do an SNB because I didn't know about it but when I had an MRI before I started chemo, there was one a bit swollen node in my axillary area but when I was done with chemo, it was completely gone and no swollen nodes were found. Breast cancer doesn't grow too fast in most cases so to wait a bit more before you actually start chemo wouldn't affect your prognosis. Ask your doctor about these and see if you can have these tests before chemo. Good luck! xo Fumi",

They decided to tell me that it was some sort of inflammation and I was stupid enough to believe it. I waited an entire year until I finally went back for a follow-up (because they had told me a year later would be enough) and this time, the lump didn't show up on any type of scans again. But the biopsy came back positive so I was finally diagnosed. I had fed my lump and grown it up to be 3.5 cm and cancer had spread to one of my lymph nodes. But guess what? I am three years and 5 months post my dx. So far so good. I am still here, alive and kicking. To learn not every test is perfect is good but don't be harsh on yourself nor blame yourself for not having known about it. You have learned it so now you can move forward. It's not the time to think what might have or might not have happened. It's the time to learn that you can beat this thing and will soon be where I am right now.  You are now in the hardest part of this journey. Things will get better once you get your treatment plan I promise! xo Fumi",

I am a Japanese living in Japan but my oncologist has never ever belittled my concern. I was diagnosed with the same type of breast cancer as yours (mine was stage 2b) in July of 2005 and did chemo before I had a lumpectomy in March of 2006. Ever since I had surgery, I have been having follow-up scans (MRI, CT, bone scan) every 6 months (just had them today!). If I ever get a symptom that concerns me, my oncologist will never wait for the next follow-ups and will certainly order as many tests as he can as soon as possible to see what's going on.  Personally I don't really think it matters where you live unless you live in a developing country where medical resources are limited. No matter where you go, there are always \"I know it all\" type of doctors. My first oncologist was terrible so I just dumped him. Just remember that you have every right to have you questions answered and your concern heard and investigated.

And there are many of them who have experience of studying overseas (mainly in the U.S. like my oncologist) so not every doctor in Japan is too bad at English. Unfortunately the northeastern region of Japan where you belong is rather a rural area so there are not so many major hospitals. But there still are a few, like in Sendai (in Miyagi Prefecture), Fukushima etc. If you don't mind travelling as far as Tokyo, then there is a hospital that is well-known for its specialization in breast cancer, called Kameda Medical Center. http://www.kameda.com/us/index.php It's located in Kamogawa city in Chiba prefecture that is about 5-6 hours away from Misawa. If you want your hospital to be closer to your place, then there is a cancer center run by a National University called Tohoku University that is about 2 hours away from Misawa. Of course you can get seen by the oncologist/surgeon who specializes in breast cancer at these hospitals or many many others. By the way, I live in the 2nd largest city in Japan called Osaka and my oncologist/surgeon is very well known for his specialization in breast cancer and his own unique way of performing surgery. He studied and worked at the National Cancer Institution in the U.S. for 8 years. If you are interested and want to meet with him, I can arrange. He works at a university hospital in Kyoto that is 6-7 hours away from Misawa but there are a few really reasonable accommodation facilities that only those in need to go to that hospital and the other one neearby for a serious disease can use (like $10.5 per a day).They are run by a volunteer group. If you want me to contact any of the above hospitals or any others (if you know), I can call them for you and ask if there is anyone who speaks English or any other questions you may want to ask. Just PM (private message) me if you want. Click on my name so my profile will come on the screen and to the right you will see \"send member a private message\". Click on this and you will be able to send me a message. I am here willing to help! xo Fumi",

In the meantime, I will treasure all the cards you sent me in the past three years and get some strength from them, like I always did from you. I wouldn't talk about you in the past tense because your spirit is still here and I can feel it. I can feel you smiling at me and probably flicking me in the head as I wouldn't stop crying otherwise. Kari, I want to share this beautiful picture of you and your sweet DH Jon that you emailed me before with everyone you have touched because both of you look so happy and I just know you would want us to remember your smiling face. Hope you don't mind my posting this.                           To those are concerned about me and left me a message in their posts or PM's, thank you so much for the word of comfort.

It must be the test called \"Oncotype\" and I think your wife has one of the best doctors in the breast oncology field in Japan. I also am Japanese living in Japan so I know how this disease is usually treated here. While this test is widely used in the U.S. and is considered very useful, it is not quite common here in Japan because they have to send the sample to the U.S. as there are no facilities here for this test. I know how scared you must be. I too was scared to hell when I was diagnosed with this bloody disease. The type of breast cancer I got was the same as your wife's but my tumor was way bigger. It was measured 3.5cm+ and one of my lymph nodes was positive. But it was 4 years ago and I am still alive and kicking. Working full time and enjoying travelling around the world. Actually I was in Melbourne this past September for holidays. Been there 3 times to visit my best friend in Melb since I finished all my active treatment (chemo, surgery and radiations) in summer of 2006. I am sure your wife will be soon where I am right now. Rest assured that this is NOT a death sentence.

Besides, it's almost funny how quickly some people forget how they felt for the first several weeks after their dx. There's a loooooooong thread where people are talking about the stupid things other people have told them and it's still going. We were all offended when people asked us stupid questions like why we got this disease or even just \"how are you doing?\". Then all of sudden, we forget about it and start asking our fellow stage IV sisters exactly the same kind of questions then blame them for not being supportive if they don't give us whatever we want from them. Blame yourself for being insensitive before blaming them. Take a look at their posts and you will find how supportive they have been for one another. If they do not treat you the same way, then it's most likely it's you that has a problem.   ",

First of all, as our sweet cyber mom Shirl posted for me, things between me and my sweet Scotty bear didn't work out the way I had wished. But that is all. It just didn't work out but by any means it is not to say he hurt or played with me. He told me that I am one of the best things that has happened to his life so far. He holds a very special place for me in his heart and still love me to bits, not in the same way as I do but still does. No worries I am not a little girl. I am not decieved, scammed or anything like that. I can tell he speaks from his heart by looking into his eyes. We will still remain friends and care for each other just the way we did before we met in person.                 Of course my heart was shattered to pieces and I had to cry my eyes out like a baby when I was told all this. I am still sad. Could burst into tears anytime. No idea how I will get over this and move forward. But hopefully I will eventually.              You would have said it was just too much to go through for a holiday but apparently it wasn't. The real nightmare just started last night.                Scotty has been back to work since this past Monday and it's his on-call week so he has been extra busy and I have been mostly by myself during the day. Yesterday was expected to be the busiest day of this week. It was about 3:00 in the midnight (technically Friday) when he finally came home from a 18 hours of non stop workingsince Thursday morning. I was in the kitchen at that time and doing the dishes. I was frightened when I saw him because he was just there standing quietly. Just about when I was to tell him \"hey you scared me. Why not say hi?\", I realized that so many tears were running on his cheeks, that he was holding his poor little baby girl in his arms. Apparently his sweet baby cat Starbuck who he just got from SPCA several months ago along with other boy cat named Apollo was hit by car and he found her dead on the driveway. We don't know if she was there because she tried to go back home or someone who knew she was his cat brought her there. The only thing I am certain is how devastated he must have been when he came home after having worked way harder than anybody should have just to find his little baby dead. I could never ever forget how awful he looked when he came into the kitchen carrying her in his arms. Just remembering that makes my eyes all teary but it keeps flashing back. I sure cried my eyes out when I figured what had happened, probably more than I should have because he had to pat and hug me when he needed it the most.                 Of course I am so very sad she died. I too was pretty much attached to her after having spent two weeks with her. So sad that she died alone and it was so cold outside. But I know he feels way far worse than I do. I know why he decided to adopt her and the other cat in the first place. I know how empty and lonely he was feeling at that time and how these two kittens brightened him up. I know how he ended up having to give the other cat Apollo to his ex g/f (long story) and how much he had to miss him. I know how this little girl always wanted to sleep on his laps and how much he loved it. It is just not right and damn cruel.             Obviously he is not handling this well (who could???). He apologized to me that he would be very quiet and introverted for a few days, that it would be pretty much affecting the remaining two days we would be spending together. He is feeling really empty and dead right now in a way he didn't think he would again.            I went shopping while he was at work today and bought some flowers and a card. I wrote my first and last letter to his little girl on the card and enclosed my necklace which she liked to play with. I put it along with the flowers beside her in the backyard. He buried all of them with her at his mom's place today. I didn't even need to hear a word from him to see how empty and sad he was feeling when he was back from his mom's. His eyes spoke it all. I held his hand with one hand and kept patting him on his shoulder with the other hand until he fell asleep on the couch. It was just too sad and too much to handle. My heart literally bleeds for him and I really don't know what I could do for him. Prayers would be highly appreciated.               xo Fumi",

Sorry you have to be worried. I'm 3.5 years out already but still do get nervous when I get pain. Craptacular isn't it?

I looked at your profile and hey, you joined this site on my birthday. I am glad that you finally had your PS listen to you. Sorry about the sores from Taxol. I was one of the lucky people who didn't get any major s/e's from it. I only had to be hairless and get some swelling in my feet.

I thought I was given the death sentence. I called my mum immediately but she couldn't cope well at all. I ended up being bashed when I needed the words of comfort the most for not getting myself looked at by a better oncologist when I first realized symptoms so that I could have been treated a year earlier. I hanged up the phone in tears and called my ex husband. It was the worst mistake I ever made. I wouldn't tell you what he said because it would only remind me of the worst memory. So it wouldn't be wrong in saying that I was totally alone literally and feeling like I was in the darkest tunnel and would never ever see the light again.                        Today I have marked three years of survivorship. In the past three years, I have seen so many women leaving behind their families, yet I am still here alive even though I have no one to leave behind besides my cats nor do I have anyone to look forward to growing up. But I have decided to cherish every moment of my life for those who had to go instead of feeling guilty for them. I believe that it's our mission to live our lives to the fulluest for those who had to go way too soon because we have been given time to live, which sadly didn't happen to them.                   I am still here, alive and kicking. I am pretty much the same silly woman as I was before cancer. So girls, rest assured that you will soon be where I am right now. Life may seem to be filled with crap at times but it does have some good in it. Like the fact that you are still here surrounded by many friends who care for you. Enjoy every minute of your life and don't be too sad. There are so many more years ahead of you. With tons of hugs, Fumi",

Anyhow, let me re-post this for those don't know how to post pictures on the board. I made this instruction ages ago and posted it but it's been buried and I don't know where it's gone. http://tamako.milkcafe.to/luv/bco_photobucket/index.htm Oh and nope my Shirley Poo, you don't need to read this. You will always have me post your pix so no worries. It's past midnight where I live (say 3am-ish) so I only skimmed through and can't address everyone. But I just had to tell this to those are struggling. If you remember what I posed the other day, in the earlier days of my cancer ordeal, I was lietrally in the darkest tunnel no one could have imagined. A lot worse than you've been through. I got divorced with my ex in May of 2002. Mind you, getting married to be a wife of someone and starting my own family had always been my only dream because I didn't grew up in a loving family (long story). I grew up feeling lonely. So when I broke up with my ex, I really thought my life was over. Actually it could have ended because I was in HUGE debt. The reason why I had to break up with him in the first place was that he and his father (my ex FIL) borrowed thousands under my name before I realized and under our current laws, there was no way I could have sued them or got help to let them pay it off for me. I haven't even paid it off yet but at that time, it seemed just too much to pay back. I could have committed a suicide if I had been more brave but since I'm such a wuss, I had to continue living and make ends. So I moved back to the place where I used to be and got a truck driver job. I still work like 16 hours a day at the busiest time of the year (though I'm not a truck driver anymore) but with such a hard job, I literally had to work without getting any sleep when I was on the road. After I worked as a truck driver for a year or so, I managed to get a new job which I'm doing now. It was just about when I thought things started improving when I was dx'd with this stupid disease. Imagine the horror of hearing that big \"C\" word without having anyone beside you and coming back to a totally empty home. I knew I wouldn't be comforted but I just didn't know what to do except calling my ex. BIG MISTAKE. He just laughed (yes I said laughed) and asked me \"so.... did the doctor give you a specific time frame as to how long you will survive?\". I hanged up in tears and called my mom. Another big mistake. After she yelled at me like hell and blamed me for not getting myself checked out by a better doctor (she was referring to a doctor from the previous year who misdiagnosed me with something benign), the first thing that came out of her month was \"so what are you gonna do with $$? Doesn't cancer cost you much? Count us out, we've already retired and you know we can't financially support you\". See, I told you I was in the darkest tunnel. I wasn't lying. But guess what? I'm still here. Better yet, I have lost 17.6 lb's since I started dieting since the middle of May! Been working on it so hard, staying under 1400 kcal and doing a 4.5 miles walk every night after work (and I always work overtime till 21:00 at the earliest) followed by a 40 minutes cardio workout. I'm almost where I was before dx. Woo Hoo! Could I have done all this because I had been special and extremely strong? I don't think so. Mostly because I just had to. I had to continue living my life and to make ends without any financial support, I had to work full time and many extra hours when I was on treatment. I didn't have any other options to choose. But I refused to let cancer have too much of an impact of how i live my life. I decided to live like as if I didn't have cancer at all simply because I 'm such a wuss and couldn't have lived in fears. Of course I have been super lucky in many aspects, like I have the best onc in the world and haven't really had any major side effects. But if I chose to dwell on the negative, the list of negative things could go way longer than positives. So even if it feels like your life is almost over, it ain't! It may take some time but you sure will be where I am. Life can be easy if your head is as empty as mine. Ha-ha! So don't you ever lose hope, you will be fine I promise! xo Fumi ",

My man isn't my man yet. *lol* Do you REALLY want to hear me talk about him? Since you asked, I will tell you what's going on around here. But remember it's you who asked. You couldn't blame me one bit if I didn't stop at all. Hee Hee. OK here we go. I met this guy in January of this year on the dating site. He's a Kiwi (New Zealander) living in Auckland NZ. He's 9 years younger than me but I have never felt an age difference between us because he's a lot maturer than his age and we have sooooooo much in common and share the same values. The second thing we noticed we're a lot alike is that he works as hard as I do (he is a computer system engineer) and the reason why he works that hard is exactly the same as why I do. It's not $$ but we just can't stand the thought that we may give our customers a negative experience with us. So now you want to hear what's the first thing we noticed that we're alike? Believe it or not, he too is a cancer survivor. Actually his case was way worse than mine. Just a year after I was dx'd, he was dx'd with a rare type of brain cancer at the age of 31. He was only given two options, have brain surgery within 2 days or die in two weeks. That's not really an option so he underwent surgery (twice to get clear margins), did 7 weeks of chemo+WBR combo and 48 weeks of chemo. So he just knows what I've been through and so do I. Although chemo drugs that are used for brain cancer are lot stronger than what are used for BC and he got pretty sick and lost his hair, it didn't stop him from doing what he wanted. He even did a half marathon when he was on chemo. I'm such a Zilla but still can't believe that! Oh speaking of which, he doesn't celebrate his cancer-versary. I just had my 3rd cancer-versary earlier this month and told him about it. Then he said he'd rather want to celebrate the day when he would have died as his \"second birthday\" because that's when he was given a new start of his life. He did a bit of google for me to see when I would have died if I hadn't been treated. Figured we would have died on the same date (a year apart though) so now we share our second birthdays which is 25th August. :) This really shows who he is. He's such a positive guy but would never try to live like dying. He keeps saying he's nothing more than who he is with or without cancer. Anyhow since we are too far apart, we haven't met each other in person nor have we talked on the phone. But we have exchanged countless emails and texts like \"three times a day basis\" and we just know we really are who we say we are.(I've even seen a picture of his scar on the head) I don't think he has romantic feelings towards me at this point but at least we are great friends. On the 3rd of September, I'm leaving for Auckland to meet him in person and will be there for 18 days with him. He's organized a getaway (3 nights 4 days) for just the two of us in one of the most popular tourists places in NZ and I can barely wait! Mind you, I've never been on any sort of holidays with a guy ever since I went on a honeymoon with my ex in 1999. The hotel he's booked for us looks so great and there's a gorgeous spa within walk distance just in front of a beautiful lake. He wants to take me there after dinner so that we could enjoy the spa along with beautiful stars in the sky. Awwww how romantic is that? I really can't believe this is going to happen. We've planned just too much for our get-together, from a small party for our second birthdays to a bread making lesson he'll be doing for me (he used to work as a chef when he was a lot younger) so 18 days could be short for us. He is a fitness freak and a cyber personal trainer of mine. Without him, I don't think I could have lost 17.6 lb's in 2 months. He too has been on a diet (though not to lose weight but to get lean muscles before he participates in a full marathon in November followed by a 62 miles charity walk in May) so I'm not alone in this. Knowing he's working hard too helps me stay determined. Oh by the way, did I tell that I call him Baby Pooh and he calls me Momma Bear?  (long story) Anyhow, I'm so happy I've met him and that we soon will be meeting each other in person. Obviously I'm pretty much in love with him but been trying to hide how I feel about him. I just know it'd be better for me to sit back and see how this pans out. Hopefully once we meet in person, things may change so stay tuned and keep your fingers crossed for me! Oops almost forgot to ask something important. He just had his follow-up MRI this past Wednesday. Ever since then, I've been nervous as heck and could vomit anytime. It's his first follow-up atfer he was done with chemo in December so can be really important. So far, no words from the hospital and he tells me it's a good sign and not to worry because he should have heard back from them if there had been anything wrong, like when they arranged more tests pretty darn quickly after his first surgery. But I am still nervous. Please for Pete's sake, send a whole bunch of positive thoughts and prayers his way. I'd be lost if we got bad news. xo Fumi",

Still no words from his hospital so I'm starting to think they didn't find anything to be concerned about. Mel, I do agree with you. A good sense of humor and a positive attitude is a must. Wish I could post here his \"cancer story\" which he wrote for a friend of his when he was dx'd if it wasn't too long. Hmmmm OK I've decided to share it with you all because it really shows who he is. He didn't even lost his humor when he was going through the most difficult time of his life. And I think you'd know why I'm so sure that he really is who he says he is. Who could have written this without actually going through this? http://tamako.milkcafe.to/luv/pb_story.htm LISA!!!!!!! You just put an ear-to-ear smile on my face! OMG, that's so incredible! Yeah we should all come and pinch you in the cheek and make you realize it really is true and what is happening to you! I am sooooooooooooo happy for you. We do need to hear some happy news. Mel, he's not baking bread for me. He is teaching me how to bake bread because I have never done that before. Believe it or not, a conventional oven is not a very common kitchen appliance here in Japan so I have never owned it. He laughs at me thinking I'd end up being all covered in flour after a bread making lesson shaking a rolling pin at him. But I must admit it could be true. *lol* Shirl, do you know how excited I am? I only have 45 days before I go see him. Wow, can't believe that! The first thing we'll be doing together is a party for our second birthdays. He's taking me to his favourite Belgium bar and after we enjoy dinner and some drinks there, we'll be heading back to home for some more drinks and fun watching movies in front of the fire. Oh since he's in the Southern Hemisphere, September is pretty much in the middle of winter so I can enjoy the fire, which I have never done before. I have sooooo much to look forward to! Have a lovely weekend everyone. I'm off to the shop for some food and do the workout! xo Fumi",

I am glad I'm going on holidays to Auckland where the season is opposite to ours. Shirl, although there are not so many things I hate in this world but one thing I really can't stand is animal/child abuse. I seriously think those who do that deserve a death penalty. Just because animals/children can't speak properly doesn't mean in any way they don't have feelings. Grrrrr just the thought that someone beat a dog for no reason drives me crazy. If I ever won a lottery, I would buy a house with a huge yard and adopt a shelter full of poor animals, which actually is one of my dreams. Judie, wow those pictures are just breathtaking! I loved them all. In fact, I googled for Lake Chelan and enjoyed more of beautiful pictures. Now you are making me want to visit your country. Thanks for sharing such great pictures and a story. Were you kidding by the way? There's no way you could have bored us! Today was the Lupron shot day for me. Last time I had it, I also did the bloodwork. Today I got the results and my tumor makers were all fine. Nothing to be concerned about. So that's a good thing! Have a great Tuesday everyone. Mine is over now. xo Fumi",

Yesterday I was asking him if I could borrow his stuff like soap, towels etc when I come and he said I could but told me to make sure I'd bring my own knickers cuz it'd be super wierd if I borrowed his boxers. I was glad I wasn't having a mouth full of coffee. Aren't those furry bugs nasty? I didn't know their hair could be carried by wind though. I will try and stay away from the trees or plants. Lisa - I know exactly how you must be feeling. Did you say you're feeling like a school girl? Hey you're not alone, I too am feeling like I'm a girl in her puberty. I keep checking my emails or texts to see if there's any from my Baby Pooh. (Oh by the way, he's my Mr. McDreamy). He only uses a PC when he's at work and he's three hours ahead of me. So if I didn't receive any emails from him by 2:00pm or so, I would have to wait until next day. Today it was a bit past 3:00pm and I still hadn't heard from him so I was almost giving up. But he did text me shortly after that and said that he was sorry he couldn't talk to me today as he had to spend all day in the meeting. He's such a sweetie and I have never met any guys like him. Guys are almost always unresponsive and could be gone MIZ for months without a word. Anyhow, don't dwell on the mistake you made in the past and just be happy. Kaloni - Where and how did you get such a beautiful picture? Thanks for posting it. It really is gorgeous. By the way how many nodes did they remove from your axillary area? Have I ever told you I have very mild lympedema in my bad (right) arm? Thankfully it's very mild, no one could ever tell I have lympedema unless they look at my arm extra carefully. Being careful is a good thing but don't be too nervous. I got this almost 2 years ago and have been avoiding heavy lifting. But other than that, I haven't really done anything. You know, I even got moth larva's poisonous hair and rashes in my bad arm. But my lympedema is still unnoticeable, no extra swelling or changes. It would be better for you to be careful not to get this thing but you really don't need to spend every minute worrying about getting it.             About time to hit the hay. Hope everyone is doing great. Beddy byes for me. xo Fumi",

      "Content": "Aug 5, 2008 02:27PM - edited Aug 5, 2008 03:19PM by nowheregirl Hi sisters,                            My Tuesday is over. The pain in my groin and lower back is 99% gone so I started doing the 40 minutes workout program yesterday. Apparently my bad leg is holding up OK. Oh have I ever showed you the bathing suit I bought a couple of months ago? http://www.aliciasimone.com/as_pages/product.php?number=149 I started doing a diet when this arrived because when I wore it and looked myself in a mirror, it looked totally different and I was like a giant pig. I have to wear it in front of Scotty (My Mr.McDreamy) when we go on a \"4 days 3 nights getaway\" and visit the spa together so I really do need to lose more of my weight. I know he wouldn't care but I do!!!                Today was a good day. Usually it's a bit hard to talk to Scotty in real time as he's a morning person while I've never been good at mornings. The time differences between us (he's 3 hours ahead of me) doesn't make it easier. But he's on-call this week (he's a computer system engineer) so he's staying up for longer hours. He emailed me 8 times today and of course that made me happy. Though don't tell anyone that we were mainly talking about what kind of rubbish bins we have and how we separate our garbage. *lol*                              Judie- I hope your colonoscopy goes smoothly and uneventfully today. Have fun with your granddaughter.                                Jane - Have I ever told you that I'm a HUGE fan of this bloke? I was so sad when he lost his wife to this damn disease. Oh I miss looking at him on TV.                                         Ulla - I'm sorry you got nasty stuff and a trojan virus on your PC. I don't really think there's anything Judie hasn't said. I used to use AVG but like you, I did get a trojan. After doing a lot of research, I finally got new anti-virus software called Avira for free. http://www.avira.com/en/pages/index.php While AVG only detects about 87.46% of viruses, Avira can detect about 94.26% of them. Though here's one thing. Avira doesn't have an email scanner so if you receive emails through an email client such as Outlook Express, I wouldn't recommend Avira. You may want to get Avast for free because it does have an email scanner and can detect more viruses than AVG. http://www.avast.com/index.html If you use web-based email such as Yahoo Mail, Gmail atc, you don't need an email scanner as they have an anti-virus filter and it blocks viruses.                                            Valerie - I am so glad you had a terrific time at Pinkstock. I do believe that the rainbows you saw there were our precious sisters who got their wings. I did see a beautiful rainbows with Donna (djd) just a couple of days after Kelly (sedgymum from Australia) passed away and it brought tears to our eyes.                                          Sheila - Earleen is a member of our picture forum and she looks like a great person. Have fun at the luncheon!                             Shirl - Good luck with your diet. I've lost 17.6 lb's so far since I started a diet in May but am still wanting to lose more!                                 Jule - So how are things going? I hope today is going great for you. Have a beautiful day!                                        Karen - Happy Anniversary! Where are you going for dinner? Hope you have a lovely time!                                               Lisa - Wow I'm on coud nine for you! A long walk at a National Park does sound romantic! Now I'm envious! Can't wait to go for a walk with My lil' Pooh bear.                                  Suebee -  I am so sorry you have to go through this. That sucks big time! You have every right to complain. Just vent away, we are here to listen.                                          Wren - I hope you are having a great Tuesday. By the way, what bird is that in your avatar?                     Oops, I should have been in bed much earlier but I still do have to respond to the email Scotty sent me tonight. I hope everyone has a lovely day today!              xo Fumi",

So no news from Sue yet? I hope she had an easy day and is having sweet dreams. Sue: Again, nice to meet you. I hope it's OK for you to have me here in the thread you started. Like you, I had never heard of ports until I came here two years ago. As I said in my last post, I did double 12 weekly Taxol and 4 EC but never had a port put in. It's just not a common thing where I live. In Japan, doctors don't opt for surgery unless it's really necessary like when there's evidence of disease. No matter how easy it seems. So they don't put a port in nor do they remove your ovaries just to be on the safe side as long as you can opt for the hormone threapy. Yes they put a needle in my hand first but since all veins were damaged enough to be undetectable, they ended up putting it in my wrist. Eeeewww! But once they successfully \"stab\" at you, you will not suffer a lot of pain. My veins are still a mess but it's not really a big deal. Shirl: So where are you going to? You will just have to email me a bunch of pix so that I can post them for us all. You will be missed. Just be prepared Ma'am, us all kids will not sit still while you are away. There will be a huge mess when you return! *lol* Karen: You look fab in your new avatar. I wouldn't have known it's a wig if you hadn't told me so. It does look so real. Oh and thanks for sharing the pictures. I just loved them all. Valerie: Even though we have never talked in person, I have known you for quite a while now. You have always been such a caring girl and I respect that. Oh by the way, I loved your doggies. They all look so smart. GB: Boy! I didn't realize you're from Ozland! Let me say I am half Aussie in sprit. You can see that from my username. You are so right, it doesn't matter how far we are apart to become friends. Did you know that I have a best friend in Melbourne whom I met over 8 years ago on the internet? I have visited her three times and am looking forward to seeing her again sometime soon. When I was dx'd with this dreadful disease, I got a bunch of cards and food from her entire family. I visited her this past May and her mom and other relatives invited me to their house and threw a BBQ party for I was strong enough to go through the ordeal. Oh one more thing... I am a huge Rove fan! Melody: Hahaha a match stick! You funny girl. It's been a while since I ditched my silly wig but I still can't help but hold my head when the wind blows hard. One thing I have learned from having been bald for such a long time is that you can get the flu from your head. I just didn't know hair was such an important thing to keep you warm. OK time to go now. I am sorry I missed so many. But know you are all in my thoughts. Have a lovely Tuesday everyone! xo Fumi",

Phew I did a full course! I have been on Lupron and Tamoxifen since February of 2006 and except for some mild hot flashes, I haven't experienced any major side effects. While I was on chemo, the only side effect I had was hair loss. No low WBC, no bruised fingernails, no neuropathy, no pain, no insomnia, nothing at all. I ditched my silly wig this past April and been enjoying both good and bad hair days. I work full time (worked throughout all treatments as well) and am as energetic as a well fed cat! No one can ever tell that I had cancer and in fact, I have had several people say I look much healthier than I was before dx. Everyone is different but if this happened to me, it could happen to anyone else! So don't you ever lose hope! Hugs,",

I really do hope both of them, especially the pain goes away real soon as I haven't worked out for nearly two weeks now. I bet I've gaind some pounds back. I still do need to lose more weight before I meet my Mr.McDreamy because I have to wear a bathing suit in front of him when we go on a getaway and visit the spa. I also need to go to the hair salon. My hair is such a big mess right now but I don't know if I should get my hair cut shorter (it's a bit shorter than shoulder length) as the heat here is killing me, or keep it on the long side as it's winter time in NZ. Things between us are going well although I'm NOWHERE near where Lisa and Jule are. To him, I'm just one of girl friends of his among many others. It's sad but I can't make him fall in love with me. *sigh*                            Shirl - I'm starting to miss seeing your face. I do love your cat but seeing your face always brought a smile to my face. Get some new pix and change your avatar!                  Ulla - thinking of you sweetie. Here's some chocolate and a beary hug for you. Fingers and toes crossed for the good results.                 Sheila - I hope you are having a lovely weekend with your DH. Sorry about his car.                 Jane - Yep I did tell him about how I was almost sending him my knickers in the mail, then he asked me if they were washed. *lol*                    Judie - Glad you are feeling better. Did you say Banoffi pie? Boy, how much I miss that yummy thing! My best friend Kelli made it for me when I visited her and I loved it!                           Karen - I'm so sorry to hear about your dad. My thoughts are with you honey, hang in there.                              Nancy - Hope you are having a fun filled weekend.                                        Melody - You sweet girl. Reading your post always brings so much comfort and fun.                          Jule - Hi dear. Wow so are you driving 5 hours every weekend? I sure hope things work out for you and that he can move closer to you.                    Sue - My favourite is an apple martini. I could drink it all day. But I wouldn't mind other vodka-based cocktails. Hope you feel a lot better soon.                      Anne - I hope bears are all gone now and that you stay safe and sound!                Lisa - Of course you are in love. I can't believe you didn't know that! Hope you are having a terrific time with him and that your pain goes away soon.                         OK gotta go now. I hope everyone is doing well. Lov ya all!                            xo Fumi",

I would have really enjoyed seeing you in the picture.  But I am glad you had a great time with Earleen.                                Jule - How are you doing? Hope everything is fine. I hope you can make it to Pinkstock next year.                               Valerie- I do like your new avatar but I would love to see you more clearly. Can't you email me that picture so I can crop it and make you two look bigger.                             Nancy - Woo Hoo for you are almost done with chemo! Only 4 days till the last round? We will have to throw a cyber party for you this weekend.                              Ulla - Don't worry about your weight now. There are so much more you have to do right now and ovbiously your plate is full. Pushing yourself into doing a diet or exercises is stressful. You can wait until you start feeling a lot better, OK?                               Sue - I loved all the pictures you posted but how adorable your prince is! I have always wanted to visit Spain mainly because the food looks yummy. ha ha! I can't wait for you to go on a holidays You so deserve it!                             Judie - Yaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy! I am so happy for you. That's such great news. I'm joining the party and enjoying Haagen-Daz! Yum yum.                              Jane - Your story about Canada reminded me of one of the best memories of mine. I visited Vancouver when I was 16 and stayed there for 2 weeks. Everything I saw was beautiful and Canada has been one of my favourite countries since then. Now you wonder what country I like the most? Believe it or not, it's where you live. Aussie Aussie oi oi oi! *lol*                                 Suebee - Good luck with your check-ups next month. I hope and pray that things at your work start improving soon. Hang in there.                              Mel - {{{{{HUGS}}}}} I don't have the words of wisdom but know my thoughts are with you. Everything looks so overwhelming and I can only pray that things will work out for you two. Thinking of you sweetie.                           Wren - Good luck with your reconstruction surgery. I hope you will get what you really want. I can't believe November is not too far away from now. No wonder we get old quickly!                                      Lisa - I am so very sorry about your friend. I too lost two of my dearest friends here on BCO this year: Jen from my chemo group and Kari who was one of the closest friend of mine. I know I am thousands miles away from you but measured in thoughts, I'm right there with you.                             Karen - I too loved the obituary. Thanks for sharing. I hope the funeral went well and that you are feeling better now. My thoughts are still with you dear.                                      Shirl - Wish I could fly like a bird so I could come and meet you. But I'm still hopeful that I will make it to your coutnry in the next couple of years. But here's a problem. Your country is just too big and all my friends live in different states. I just don't know where I should go.                                         Mouse - It's officially 20th August where I live so I am celebrating your first cancer-anniversay. Here's to many many many more years!                                      Kaloni - Looks like you've been busy. Don't forget that we too love you. Hope things calm down soon. Things are not the same when you are not here.                                 Anne- That's fantastic you got to meet Sheila. Now you've got me jealous. Our heat is still here, just doesn't seem to be gone anytime soon. It's been 97-ish for the last several weeks and the worst part of this is that the temperature wouldn't drop down any lower than 86F even at night. Grr.                                Can you all believe I only have 15 days left till I finally meet my Scotty bear in NZ? I can hardly believe that! I've got a pair of new jeans, a mini skirt (yeah I said mini!), two pairs of leggins and a necklace. Of course I want tons more but it indeed is super hard to get something nice to wear in the COLD weather when we are pretty much in the middle of summer. I wish our seasons weren't opposite. But anyway, I'm physically ready to meet him. Oh did I say I have lost 22 lbs since I start dieting in May? When I went shopping for new jeans, I didn't know what my waist size was. I knew it was smaller than before but never knew know it was 6 inches smaller!!! Hooray for me. I really can't wait anymore to see him but am a bit nervous at the same time. I just hope I don't disappoint him. Oh by the way, he had an assessment with his onc today and his last MRI was finally officially came back clear. Now we are party'ing!                 Hope you all enjoyed the pictures (all taken in my country) and that you have a great Tuesday (Wednesday for Jane). Talk to you soon.                     xo Fumi",

Just wanted to wish everyone a happy Wednesday.  My Scotty bear had surgery yesterday to have a bad screw removed from his head. Everything went well and he's back home already. He's still feeling flat out from the general anesthesia but we are hoping he will get more energy back soon. Oh and also his hair! They had to cut it short and he's a bit sad to have such a short haircut (and one bald patch) after finally getting his hair back from chemo. But to me, it's nothing that's for sure. As long as he is who he is, that's all that matters to me. Can't believe I'll be on the plane to NZ the same time next week! Nite nite now. Later gator everyone. Have a beautiful Wednesday. Fumi",

I can tell you this because I did chemo a total of 28 times (12 Taxol before/after surgery and 4 EC). If I can do that, then you can do that too for sure! Epirubicin was the hardest part for me and I felt really sick. But I didn't even take a single sick day from work. I was able to recover in a week or a couple of days more. 3 weeks is enough long to get better. As for the stats, here's my theory. The odds of my cancer coming back are either 100% or 0%. It doesn't matter what those stats or doctors say because everyone is different. We are not numbers. I have figured that it's pointless to be worried if my odds were either 100% or 0%. If I had to fall into the 100% group, I wouldn't want to spend my very limited time being worried. And if I fell into the 0% group, then there's no need to be worried in the first place! I know, I am just too air-headed but that does help! Poppy, I have no words of wisdom about the period thing as I was in chemopause when I had a lumpectomy. But know you're in my thoughts and that I will be sending a lot of healing and soothing vibes your way across the Pacific. Everyone, have a lovely Wednesday. Mine was already over. xo Fumi",

My heart is still bleeding, the hurt and nightmare I had when I was with Scotty are still real and raw but literally I haven't had much time thinking about what I didn't want to.                 Work here is crazy. I haven't been able to get home any earlier than 11pm since I was back from holiday. Some days I even had to survive without getting a lunch break. Apparently all my customers had decided to wait for me and not looked for anyone else to take care of their needs so as soon as I was back, they started offering me tons of jobs. Mind you, it's not supposed to be a busy season for me by any means and the real busiest season is almost around the corner. It should start from the mid of November and last till the end of April. I wonder how busy it will be because I have been already too busy!              As for the relationship between me and Scotty, we decided to remain friends when we were together so we have been talking in emails just like we used to do before we met in person. It does look as if nothing happened; the only difference is that now I clearly know where I should stand. Of course it is hard, super hard I would say. But I just couldn't stand the thought that I would never ever be able to talk to him so I chose to stay friends. Would you blame me for that? Well, deep down I know I am deceiving myself and that's probably why I have been having sad dreams for the last several days. But what else could I have done?               One day I feel normal and just too busy and the next I get down in dumps. I don't even know if I will ever be able to smile from the bottom of my heart. But life goes on, no matter where you are.             Thanks for being concerned, my dear family.             xo Fumi",

It depends but our official guidelines say that weaning should start at 5 months and be completed by 18 months. If breastfeeding was a prevention, the incidence of breast cancer in my country should have decreased after the WWII because during the war time, people didn't have enough food and even if they did, women were the last to eat. Plus women had the average of 4-5 children of their own as oppsoed to 1-2 these days. They didn't have enough breast milk in the first place due to the lack of nutrition and since they had more children of similar ages than they do now, the amount of breast milk that one child was given was much less than it is now. But the incidence of breast cancer in Japan has significantly increased. It's about 5-6 times as high as it was around the war time.",

Oh well,                     Judie - I am glad the funeral went beautifully. Know that we will be here for you 24/7 and holding your hand.                      Cheryl - I chose to have a lumpectomy (kind of reductions) instead of a mastectomy (whole removal). Lumpectomy + radiations work the same way as a mastectomy though some people still would choose to get a mastectomy because they don't want radiations or want to make sure they have no breast to get the cancer back in. It's been 3 years and a half since I was diagnosed and so far so good. I swear no one could even tell I had cancer.                     Lisa - My sweet friend, I hope you have fun with your grandsons.

I'm too lazy to make effort I guess. *lol*                           Val - My friend, you can have a break if you want but you can't totally leave us because you are needed here.

It's so great to hear that your dad is doing alright.                            Jane - I too watched the Sydney fireworks on TV and actually that's the first thing I saw for the new year.

Looks like this place is filled with warmth and love. I hope it's OK with you all to have me here. A little about myself. I was dx'd in July of 2005 with stage IIB IDC. My tumor originally measured more than 3.5cm and MRI's comfirmed at least two positive nodes. I was put on chemo immediately, 12 x weekly Taxol followed by 4 x EC every 4 weeks. By the time I finished with chemo, my tumor was only 0.8cm and those two positive nodes were gone. Had a lumpectomy in March of 2006 followed by another 12 x weekly Taxol. Call me a chemo veteran! *lol* Then went on to 30 x rads and have been on Tamoxifen and Lupron shot since February of 2006. I started chemo in July of 2005 and finally finished in June of 2006. So just until I ditched my silly wig in April of this year, I had been bald for more than a year. Now no one can tell I had no hair for such a long time as my hair has 100% grown back. I am so sorry that many of you are losing hair but hey it sure will grow back! Look at these pictures of myself. The first one was taken on the 22nd July of 2006 and the second one was taken just a couple of weeks ago. Yeah I was being funny in one of those silly photo booth with my friend who I did meet here on BCO. Can you believe that she came to see me in Japan all the way from the US?                  So... Sue, don't feel alone just because the majority women here don't live in your country. We are all close in spirits and we will all get together someday if we wish hard enough!              Much love,                     Fumi ",

It was like sailing alone in the ocean getting seasick for an entire week. But from what I have heard from those in the States, they have more antinausea meds than we do here because it takes way too longer here to get the drugs to be approved than in the States. So many of my friends there didn't suffer from nausea as much as I did because of the good meds. So there's a good chance that you'll be given effective meds. xo Fumi",

Then guess what? On top of all these, now my abdomen to lower back area is full of nasty rash and it literally itches like hell. To make it worse, I noticed the rash on Friday night so no matter how badly it itched, there was no way I could have met with the dermatologist as it was the weekend and no doctors were open except the ER. I really wanted to cry like a baby 'cause the itching was beyond what I could have tolerated. Then this morning, I went to the dermatologist. Turned out it was shingles!!! He did give me cream and some antiviral pills but I was warned that the itching might not go right away 'cause unlike for other rashes, the use of steroid to relief the itching wasn't the option as it might be rather harmful. So the cream I've got is more about killing viruses than itching. According to him, it may take 2-3 weeks until the rash is gone. WTF? Does that mean I will have to cope this itching for another 2-3 weeks? Bloody hell! It's already unbearable and it's only been 3 days. No way I could tolerate this any longer. Any kind of diseases makes you feel miserable especially when you live by yourself. Plus if that's something that would make you look ugly or gross, it could really get you down. I have never liked looking at myself in a mirror since my breast was gone but sadly I have to look at myself anytime I put cream on the rash. And no matter how badly it itches and irritates me like hell, I still have to do all the housework, chores and work by myself. No one will drive 1.5 hours for me to get me the Lupron shot tomorrow. (I should be able to get the results from my follow-up as well.) Not only physically but more emotionally it gets to me. I can't even be a good mom to my cats as I'm always somewhat irritated. I really want to cry. Thanks for listening. xo Fumi",

I posted in the rose shower thread asking if there's anybody that could help me participate in that wonderful act of love, then guess what? When I came back after work and went to read that thread, there were 3 women telling me that they already had ordered my roses. I went from no rose to 3! But that's not the end of the story. I had a couple more people PM me asking if I was still looking for help or just telling me they too had ordered my roses. They all said I didn't have to repay and just *pay forward* instead. So I donated some $$ to BCO in memory of Deb, as well as in honor of those generous women that helped me. Maybe you could make a donation or how about sending something to Deb's girls? I think they'd be thrilled to receive something in the mail all the way from the U.K. Just a thought.            Sorry I should go back to work now.

Before I got this stinky disease, I was seriously thinking about moving in with my best friend in Melbourne permanently but now I can't because my insurance wouldn't cover anything if I was out of this country.                          Shirl - A real good friend of mine whom I met over the internet years ago used to live in Ft.Lauderdale. Though I know almost nothing about Florida except that they get lots hurricanes. Do you get them too in San Diego? Speaking of which, when I was watching American Idol doing the audition in San Diego, I thought of you. Even expected you to be there!                           Nancy - Congrats on finishing chemo! Oh did you say you bought Kimono? Where the picture? I would really love to see you in it. And yep all the pictures I have posted in my last couple of posts are mine. I used to have a very good digital camera but accidentally dropped it in water and of course it broke.                            Karen - I have so many songs from 7-80's in my mp3 player. Actually I was listening to some of them today, like Alan parson's Project, REO Speedwagon, The Cars, Bread, Huey Lewis and the News etc. My Scotty Bear sent me a DVD with the songs from his iPod (over 300 songs!) a few months ago and it had some good oldies too.                            Lisa - Glad you had a great time with Dennis at the concert. I too am sure your girls will love him. Who wouldn't? It's so sweet of him to put off his business trip to be with you. He does sound like a nice guy.                                   Valerie - I was going to email Shirl some pictures which I'd be taking on my holiday in NZ from my cell phone but just realized she wouldn't know how to post them for you to see! *lol* I will try to pop in here when he's at work if I can.

By the way, I smile anytime I see you smile in your avatar.                                   Ulla - Wonderful news!!! I knew NED wouldn't leave you alone though. You're just too nice to leave! No matter how fat you may think you are or how funny you may think your hair is, you ARE beautiful and I mean it!                              Mel - Sorry about your friend Cheryl. Of course she, along with you and your SO will be in my prayers. I hope and pray things do start getting better for you soon. Great to hear you had fun swimming! Wishing your son good luck with the job hunting.                                  It's been a bitterweeet week for me. On Wednesday when I and my Scotty bear were chit-chatting via email, he got a problem at work. He wanted to go home early on that day because he came to work before 7:00 in the morning but he didn't make that happen. That problem turned out to be a major incident in the network he's taking care of. (He's a senior system engineer). He ended up working non-stop till Thursday evening. In case you forgot already, I said he came to work before 7:00am on Wednesday, which means he had to work non-stop without getting any sleep for over 30 hours. He still emailed me quickies from time to time to let me know how things were going but all I did during these 30 hours was tell him I was thinking of him or pryaing for him. I felt crap. I ended up crying my eyes out because I was feeling so useless, worthless and helpless and just thinking how exhausted he must be broke my heart to pieces. This turned out to be a major meltdown. I had been pretty much depressed just until I got to talk to my best friend Kelli in Australia on MSN today. She didn't know a thing at all, just emailed me earlier today to see how I was doing. Apparently she would always know whenever I need her. Actually it didn't even take an hour till she managed to pick me up. I just love this woman to bits! On the brighter note, I was surprised that Scotty sensed something was wrong with me when I was down. I didn't tell him anything and he didn't even see me in the eye. It was so sweet of him being that sensitive to me. Anyhow ladies, only 10 days to go and 11 days to see him in person (leaving at night on the 3rd and arriving in the morning on the 4th). These are something he suggested me the other day that we could do these on our getaway. http://www.agrodome.co.nz/Agrodome/Agrojet_IDL=6_IDT=1056_ID=5972_.html http://www.agrodome.co.nz/Agrodome/Shweeb_IDL=6_IDT=1056_ID=13558_.html Looks like a loads of fun? I'm sure I will have a blast and this will become the trip of lifetime for me. Oops almost forgot to ask you something important. My Scotty bear is having surgery this upcoming Tuesday in his time which makes it Monday night in your time (except Jane). He has 6 titanium screws in his head that used to keep the big chunk of his skull that they opened up for the brain surgery in place while the bone healed. One of the screws has been causing him pain as it's been pushing nerves in his head. (He often makes fun of himself saying he does have a screw loose in his head!) He says it's one day admission and an easy operation but of course I'm getting nervous. Please pray for him that the surgery goes smoothly without a hitch.                OK everyone, have a beautiful weekend. You all are in my thoughts.                 xo Fumi",

Only three days to go and thee days and a half to finally see my Scotty bear in the flesh! Can you believe it? I am more than excited. I could wee in my pants anytime. His surgery went well but he has been feeling a bit weird. We are guessing it's from the general anesthesia he had. Other than that, he's ok-ish. Oh I did ask him if I could use his PC's and got an yes! So I can come here and talk to you all when he is at work or the gym. He said he'd already set my account up on his PC (he uses Linux) and would be making Spag Bol and Tiramisu for our first night. Both are my favourites and of course I can't wait. Then on the first Sunday I come, we are leaving for a getaway and spending three nights and four days in Rotorua. I just hope the weather will be good so we can enjoy beautiful stars in the sky soaking ourselves in the spa. Everything he's planned for me sounds very exciting and lovely. Oh boy, I really can't wait!                                Anne - Oh so you too are going to NZ for three weeks? Sounds like a gorgeous holiday. If you have any questions about NZ, feel free to ask me. I will get the answers for you. Christmas time in Summer was kinda weird but fun also.

Sounds like it's too much to go through for her family. Cancer does suck but I am glad she has you as a friend. Do you like to ski yourself too? I have only done skiing once but it was ages ago.

I like them and often listen to their songs. I will check out the move you mentioned. I like funny movies.                              Mel - I am so happy for your clear results but so sorry about your DH.

I'm not sure when is my official cencerversary is as there's no clear definition of what date to celebrate, right? I thought it'd be the day I was diagnosed but have decided to go with my Scotty bear who celebrates the day he would have died if cancer hadn't been treated as a second birthday.                                  Nancy - I too ma glad your mom was able to spend her last couple of years with your dad being sober. So how are you feeling after having done with chemo? I hope you're doing great.                                  Valerie - Hey you bad girl. You shouldn't have made us miss you. Congrats on your cencerversary too. Oh did ya get the PM I sent you the other day with the avatar I made for you? Hope you and UB are having a beautiful long weekend. And yes I am counting. It's like 81 hours now.                                      Shirl - So sorry about your daughter. I never knew you had been through such a tough time. Almost 55 years with your DH? Wow, that's a long time. I do love fresh juice although I don't have a juicer. I will ask my Scotty bear if he has one so that I can make some yummy juice when I come.                                    Ulla - When are you watching Mamma Mia? I hope you have a lot of fun. Congrats on your cancerversary too. Looks like so many of gals here have their anniversaries in this month. Why don't you eat anything but salad? You should eat more than that. And nope we will not forgive you because you haven't done anything wrong in the first place.                                   Kaloni - Good luck with making a website for poor animals. You are such a sweet girl. Feel free to ask me for help as I have made a lot of websites as my job. Being busy is good but don't you ever forget to take good care of yourself.                                     Karen - Another congrats on your cancerversary. I hope you are feeling better now. How's your mom doing? Our summer seems to have gone and it's been either raining or overcast for these several days. I haven't seen the sun lately.                           Sue - I too thought you were on holidays. So sorry you have been having a hard time. But I guess it's just scar tissue.

For the first several weeks, it was really hard and there was a number of times I had to burst into tears. But now I'm kind of getting used to this.

Got shingles several weeks ago. The itching was almost unbearable and the rashes looked really gross. On the plus side, thankfully and surprisingly I didn't get any sort of pain at all. Just the itching that drove me crazy. I still do have some rashes left but the itching is gone so I can cope them.                    Then a few days ago, I noticed a lump-ish (or more like a knot-ish) thing in my good armpit area. Emailed my \"the world best\" oncologist but I was half sure it wasn't the big C since it hurt when I touched it and it grew big really fast. He called me immediately but after I explained the symptoms or what it looked like, he was almost sure it was a cyst. So did I stopped worrying? Of course not. I was still pretty worried and nervous. Met with him on Tuesday night. He checked it and told me it was nothing but a cyst. Though the nightmare wasn't over yet. He told me to lie on the bed so that he could cut my armpit open and remove the bad stuff. I was like WTF????? Hey I'm such a wuss. It was done under the local but I still felt it and actually it hurt. Now I have been meeting with my GP to get the wound clean with iodine and drained. On the first day, it hurt like hell and made me almost teary. But today it wasn't too bad so I am guessing it's on the mend. Will have to get this done for the next 8 days.                      The real busiest time of the year at my work hasn't even started yet. I think it will officially start sometime next week and last till the end of April. During those busiest months, I will have to work 14-16 hours a day and won't get home any earlier than 1:00am. So I may not be around all that often but you should know that I will be thinking of everyone daily. Will try to pop in and say hi from time to time.          In the meanwhile, you all take care and have a great time. You are my family and I love every single one of you.                  xo Fumi",

Of course I worked till a bit past midnight on my birthday and will be working my butt off on Christmas day too. It's not a public holiday here and December has been always hectic at my work so I have never done anything special on both my birthday and Christmas day for decades now. Just can't wait till my winter break which is from 30th this month to 4th next month.

Call the local florist called \"Tammy's Flower's & Gifts\" at 907-260-5355 (make sure it's AK so there must be some time differences) and speak to Rachel and tell her that's for Deborah Clonan's service. She is the one that has been taking care of this. If she's not there, just tell the person on the phone that you are calling to get a pink rose for Deborah Clonan. I am sure after getting over 150 calls, every single person at the florist knows what you are talking about!            xo Fumi",

Your head is the hairiest part of your body, right? Usually it doesn't hurt but once it gets infected like mine, it hurts when you touch it and grows fast unlike cancer. I had it removed under the local the other day without a hitch. Mine felt like the size of a prune when I touched it but it actually wasn't that large when it was removed.You should get it checked regardless of what it is. The sooner the better. Oh and if you want to get it ckecked, you should go to either the dermatologist or the surgeon. xo Fumi",

The place you mentioned sounds really nice. Nancy, believe it or not, I don't trust the profiles either. I never knew I would meet someone on the dating site. What is written in the profile doesn't really matter to me. What I look is the effort the person must have put when they wrote it. But it's not easy and actually he is the only guy that has never disappointed me. Most guys turned out to be a huge disappoint and I quit talking to them after I exchanged a couple of emails with them. I wouldn't have tried online if I had had more time.

My bad boob (wasn't bad at that time) weighed approx. 1lb. *lol* Jane, thanks. It is getting hard to wait and I'm losing my patience! Oh wait, I have never had a lot of patience in the first place. *lol* Shirl, Osaka is well known as a high-humidity area. Everyone from other places would say it's like having a steam bath. And nope, most residential areas in Osaka don't belong to the port area. Actually the nearest beach from my apartment is an hour drive away. As for getting animals as your pet, the get them because they want. What they're lacking is responsibility. What they really should know is that they can't dump or neglect a pet just because it doesn't always do things or grows up the way they want. They just get a pet just because they want it, just like a 3 year toddler wants a new toy. To have a pet always requires a lot of responsibility because it is alive. The saddest part of this is that those animals or kids that are neglected or abused still love their owners/parents no matter how horrible they are. Wren, glad you had fun watching Mamma Mia. Have you ever seen the musical version of that movie? My Baby Pooh just text'd me as his next assessment date was confirmed. It's a month away so we are assuming that the results from his follow-up MRI were all clear because if there's anything wrong, they would have arranged it sooner, right? Wow, we are almost ready to celebrate his being NED. Oh by the way, today he sent me an email with the subject line that read \"hump day with no humping\" and I was cracking up at work. Too bad I was sitting in front of my boss! *lol* Sleep tight everyone. Hope tomorrow is going great for you all. xo Fumi",

      "Content": "Aug 10, 2008 09:42AM - edited Aug 10, 2008 01:21PM by nowheregirl Hi all,           I have been sort of glued to TV these days, which doesn't happen always as I have never been a big TV person. We have two major high school baseball championships twice a year, one is in Spring and the other in Summer. Although I don't watch the pro baseball anymore, I still do enjoy those championships as the boys are a lot more dedicated and innocent than any pro baseball players. They solely play to win for the honor, not $$. And I used to play baseball in a team myself when I was in school. And now we have the Olympics. Personally I prefer the Winter Olympics as I love figure skating but that's not to say I don't watch the one in Summer. Personally I find it a lot more addictive to watch the individual events than the team sports. Mainly because I'm not familiar with most of them, and don't really know the rules etc. So far, I've been enjoying to watch Judo, Swimming, Gymnastics and am looking forward to Synchronized Swimming and Athletics (Track & Field in the U.S.?). It's kinda interesting though, to see they broadcast different events in different countries. For instance, Scotty said he enjoyed watching Hockey today but I don't believe they broadcasted it here except for some highlights on the news. I'm almost sure they wouldn't cover Judo in the States? Speaking of Scotty, thanks for the prayers for him. I appreciate it. Please keep them coming. It's getting closer and closer until I meet him in person and of course I'm getting excited. He has booked leave from work from the day I arrive (4th) to the second Friday I'm there (12nd) , which should give us entire 11 days to be together 24/7. Though unfortunately on the second week (from 15th Monday to 22nd Monday), he will be on-call 24/7 and should be busier than he usually is. Even if he didn't get called out, he would have to pop off in the evenings to be back to work to do the regular maintenance work and wouldn't be back till late midnight or early morning. But he said I could tag along with him so it should be fun looking at him work his butt off. I wil just have to make sure I'm taking good care of him and our meals are ready to eat before I go with him.                         Jule - I too am worried I will gain all the extra pounds back once I'm back from NZ. I have been more patient than I usually could be and haven't had much of my favourite stuff since I started doing a diet. I've been doing a low-carb diet and the hardest part of this is I can't eat as much rice as I used to eat. In Japan, we do live on rice so it's really hard to stay away from it. Maybe the best way not to gain the weight back is to make a pinky promise with Scotty to do the get-together again next year.                               Sue - Sorry you got your period back but you're too young to go into menopause. I haven't had mine since I started taking Lupron in February of 2006 and not sure if I will ever get it back when I finish Lupron in January of next year. As much as I don't want it back, I kinda miss to have it because it's one of the factors that make me a woman and I've already lost my boob and I'm single.                           Sheila - How are you doing? Miss seeing you here. Hope you are doing great.                       Valerie - Thanks for the prayers. Aren't you exhausted anymore? That's so great UB's port will be removed soon. Must be a huge relief for you. And nope, no room in my suitcase for you, silly girl.                     Judie - Have I told you I love your avatar? I am so glad you had a lovely time with your son and grandson. What an adorable prince you have! Loved the pictures. Thanks for sharing.                            Shirl - Thanks for the kind words but you don't *necessarily* have to be in NZ in spirit with me. I wouldn't be enjoying \"this and that\" with him if you were there with me in spirit.  *lol*                       Jane - Thanks for the prayers for Scotty. I guess your prayers should be arriving before ours because you live the closest to him! Sorry you couldn't make it to the mountains today. Hope you have a lovely time there tomorrow. Wow can't believe you have snow over there. I can send you some heat anytime!                                Susan - What are your favourite nursery rhymes? I loved Mother Goose, though I only learned it when I was much older for the nursery rhymes. Any chance we could see your grandson?                              Karen - My heart goes out to you sweetie. I am so sorry about your dad. He, you and your entire family are in my thoughts. Thinking of you hon.                             Lisa - My fingers and toes and everything that is crossable are crossed for Olivia! Also I'll be sending a lot of positive thoughts and healing vibes your way when you have a hysterectomy.              Nancy - I'm not really sure but would agree with Judie. It must have been the buoyancy of the water. I've heard that walking in the pool as rehab for a broken bone in your leg can make fast recovery. Anyway I hope you get to go swimming as often as you can!                               Kaloni - So good you dropped by. I hope you are doing well and that things calm down soon for you. Miss you girl.                                Melody - I was about to ask everyone how you were doing. Glad you checked in but so sorry about your SO and that you had to work when he was sick. I pray that things start improving for you two real soon. Hang in there sweetie.                     OK about time to back watching the Olympics. This time I posted from my photo collections that were all taken by me. Hope you all enjoyed to see what my country looks like and that you are having a fabulous weekend!                        xo Fumi",

I'm not sure what that x-ray thing means but from what I have experienced through my cancer journey, x-rays aren't used so commonly to see what's wrong with a person who had this disease. Personally my onc would run MRI's, CT's or bone scans on me if he thought I needed them. Ultimately x-rays aren't good for your health so full x-ray on your full body could do harm on your health. If you are unsure if it's worth, you shouldn't do that. If I remember correctly, you live in Sweden, right? Sweden isn't an isolated country where people would go hunting in the deep woods to get their daily food. It's a developed country. They do have more advanced methods to check you out. Sorry for being ignorant but what is your problem? Do you have pain somewhere in your body? If they think you may have bone mets, then they should do bone scans. If they think your cancer may have been back in your organs, then they should do an MRI, a CT or a PET. Don't really think x-rays are the option you should choose. Try and seek for a second opinion. In the meanwhile, I will keep you close in my prayers. xo Fumi",

      "Content": "Jul 24, 2008 12:27PM nowheregirl wrote: Hi all, I'm in a chatty mode so you have to be prepared. I have two things to tell you all, one bad and one hilarious.  Will start with the bad. Now I'm in a HUGE pain! My right half body has been feeling sore since yesterday. As some of you may know, I've been doing a diet since the middle of May. I used to do a 4.5 miles walk after I got home from work but who could have keep walking in this crazy heat? It's been 80-ish even at night so I have changed my exercise programs from \"40 minutes cardio workout & a 4.5 miles walk\" to \"40 minutes cardio workout x 2\". I was still sweating buckets when doing the workout but at least I was in a comfortablly air-conditioned room. Anyhow, when my right half body started feeling sore yesterday, I thought I must have got sore muscles. But soon I realized it wasn't anything like that. First, I didn't feel any pain at all unless my right foot was held in a certain position, which I couldn't tell what that position actually was. Secondly, I couldn't pin-point where the pain was located. It was somewhere between my lower back and right groin area but that was all I could tell. Then today, after I met with my customer, I was to move down the steps and felt this intense pain in the groin area. I couldn't even move one bit without holding a handrail. So I decided to go to the the osteopathist near my office. After he did some palpation, he told me what I was getting was called \"groin pull\" caused by ligament injury. It's a strain of the adductor muscles at the attachment region in the groin area. He said it must have caused because I had already hurt the ligament a few days ago but didn't realize it and kept doing that exercise program in which I had to kick to all directions balancing myself on one foot. I had some acupuncture treatment and got some cold packs. Of course I have been told not to do any sort of exercises that require me to put my weight on my bad foot until the pain subsides. I couldn't start working-out anytime soon anyway because the pain is really, really bad. I have to meet him tomorrow too to get more acupuncture treatment along with some massage. According to him, the pain should be gone within a week so I can start working-out again sometime in the next week. Riding a bike is OK so at least I can keep commuting by it. OK now hilarious story. I went to a large supermarket for some food and stuff on the way to my customer this past Friday but for some reason, I went to the upstairs where you would find things like towels, underwear, cookware etc. Then I found those cute Pooh towels and immediately was reminded of my \"McDreamy\" (because I call him Baby Pooh) so I grabbed them and went to the checkout.  Too many people were waiting in a line so by the time finally I got my turn, I was pretty much irritated as I had an appointment with my customer and I didn't have much time left but wanted to go to the post office before the appointment to mail him them. I asked the shop girl to remove the tags etc so that I could send them right away. I dashed to the post office, got a mail bag and quickly put things in it along with the cd's I had burned for him the other day and was carrying in my bag. Then I sent him them in the mail before the long weekend (the following Monday was a public holiday) and managed to meet my customer in time. Now on Monday I was doing the laundry as it was a public holiday and I was off. The weather was perfect to dry things outside. When I grabbed all my knickers to put them on the clothline, this horrible thought popped up in my mind out of the blue. I was freaked out. I knew I had bought a whole bunch of undies but no matter how hard I tried to recall when I had bought them, my chemo-polluted brain couldn't bring back the memory. All I knew was that I had bought them exactly in the same section of the same store as I bought things for him. I couldn't recall if I had bought my undies before I bought his towels or bought them all at the same time. If I had bought them all together, it would have meant I sent him my brand-new undies because I put everything I bought in that shop's plastic bag without looking at them!!!!!!!! Literally I felt the blood drain from my face. You'd never know how relieved I was when I found my brand new undies sitting in my drawer. I burst into laughing when I figured that out. I'm such a silly girl. Today he received the care package from me and I'm so, so glad he didn't receive my \"granny panties\" in the mail.      Kaloni, I hear you. My first ever dream was to become a vet but like you, I couldn't stand the thought that I would have to put animals to sleep or watch them die without being able to do anything for them. Oh by the way, I responded to your post re: how to put pix in your post. Lisa, boy I can't wait to read your next post. You will just have to give us some juicy details about your lunch date. I too am on cloud nine today as my man was real chatty and we exchanged 10 emails. He has been stressed out lately as things at his work was like a huge mess but today he told me that there has definately been times when I have provided him some stress relief as only a good friend can. Awww do you know how happy I was to hear this? Shirl, so when's your 55th anniversary? A trip to Niagara Falls sounds cool. Take a lot of pix and email me them so I can post them for you and everyone here, OK? Valerie, yeah animal lovers do think alike. My McDreamy wanted to become a vet too but like me and Kaloni, he said he couldn't have put animals to sleep. He has two cats too, Hammy & Starbuck and he got them both from the local shelter. He has been making a donation every month to SPCA. Anne, good luck with your colonoscopy tomorrow (or already today?). Sounds like Mama Mia is a real good movie. Can't wait to see it. Too bad it always takes months until we get to see the movies filmed in overseas countries as they have to dub them. Melody, sorry but I don't have an answer because I have never done colonoscopy myself. My dad did and it was done within a couple of days from the first appointment with the surgeon but I guess it was because he assumed that my dad had colon cancer, and he actually did. Sheila, what a heartwarming story about baby Jay's. Wish each and every parent could bring their children up the way you did, so that there would be no animal abuse at all. OK gotta run. Hit a shower before going to bed. Hope everyone has a grand Thursday. xo Fumi",

      "Content": "Jul 31, 2008 03:48AM - edited Jul 31, 2008 12:59PM by nowheregirl Happy Thursday all.  Valerie - Hooray for you and UB! Such a huge relief isn't it? You are going to have a fabulous time at Pinkstock and I can't wait to hear all the jucy details. Have a safe trip and lots fun! Shirl, Glad the earthquake didn't affect you. I have lived in Japan for 40+ years now but never ever got used to the shakes. They would always remind me of the worst memory I had in 1995. A huge earthquake followed by loads of aftershakes hit us and 6437 people died. Jane - Gosh, I'm such a stupid emptyhead. I never realized you're in Australia until now. Where about in AU do you live? My bestest friend Kelli whom I met over the internet 10 years ago is in Melbourne and I've been there 4 times. In October of last year, she sent me a packet of Pink Timtam in the mail and I loved it! Karen - Awwwwww what an adorable dog you have! Rusty is such a cutie pie. By the way, I love the butt that is just right next to your Rusty in the second picture. Never knew a butt could make such a cute picture. *lol* Sheila - I hear ya! It was really frustrating that we had to let those nasty morons post crap after crap without being able to do anything. Hopefully BCO will add a better spam filter. Judie - I had never ever liked dentists since I met this guy. Several month ago, my wisdom teeth started like crazy so I looked for reviews on dentists written by patients over the internet and found him. The first thing I thought after he treated my tooth was \"yikes! If I had known there was a dentist like him, I could have come years earlier!\". I hope your tooth aren't hurting. Sue - You silly girl. Like everyone said, you don't have bone mets, let alone IBC. Go eat some chocolate and be happy. You can't go to the mets board cuz we've locked the door. Wren - So how's your \"not spring but summer cleaning\" going? Will ya post some pix of your house once you've done with it? Would really love to see your house. Lisa - So is Dennis back today? I bet you can't wait. Give him some big smooches and let him spoil you. I am so happy you have met such a great guy. Ulla - Will we ever get used to the waiting game? But I think your onc wouldn't wait till the next appointment and should have contacted you if there had been anything that concerned him. So no news is good news. Hang in there sweetie. Nancy - Hooray for your son. Sounds like he's got the job he deserved. I hope and pray that your pain goes away soon and that you have an easy start at work. Just don't overwork OK?            OK before I give you some update on me, let me thank you all for being concerned, offering so much comfort and encouragement. I have always been emotional and even have a quick temper so I get angry or feel pretty down from time to time. But I just can't hold on to negative emotion. I guess I am just a born forgetful or happy-go-lucky. So no matter how angry or sad I was, it wouldn't last more than a week. Plus becoming too forgetful is one of the common s/e's of Lupron which I have been on for 2 years and a half now. It's like I wet my pillow with tears but by the time I wake up in the morning, I wouldn't even remember why I was sad.   The pain in my groin area and my butt is much better now although it still does hurt when walking, especially moving down steps. It will take a bit more time until the pain is completely gone but at least I won't be in pain when I go on a holiday to NZ. So that's a good thing.   I haven't done anything about my car just yet. I am guessing that it's the battery that is dead. So probably a jumpstart would work but I will just take it out and bring it to the service that we have been using at my work. Then they will see if it has to be replaced with a new one or just needs to be charged.   As for my bike, it's fixed now. Thank goodness, it only cost me 3 bucks! But I am still a bit pissed that someone pulled it down and just left it. It's the worst part of living in an apartment. You have to either park your bike downstairs or carry it all the way to your room.    My Mr. McDreamy, aka Scotty whom I call Baby Pooh has been doing an awesome job to cheer me up. He would never say anything special like \"you know I am here for you\" or \"I am thinking of you\" etc (though I wouldn't mind at all if he said those things, that's for sure!) but to steal his words, he would provide me comedy relief. Knowing how much he has got on his own plate, I can't even begin to thank him. A couple of days ago,  I woke up with negative feelings and could have never known I would end up having a belly laugh shortly after that. I was enjoying a morning cup of coffee at work when he texted me. I really shouldn't have read it when I was having mouth full of coffee especially in front of my boss. Ended up spilling it all over and making a huge mess on my desk. This is what he said. -------------------------------------------------------------- my memory is a bit like an ice-berg full of penguins... since the brain surgery, not only has the ice-berg shrunk, but alot of penguins decided it was a good place to stay... unfortunately the ice-berg is now full...so new penguins arriving tend to kick other penguins off... one of the penguins that was kicked off, was holding the information about you living in osaka. -------------------------------------------------------------- Just picturing a whole bunch of penguins buzzing in his head walking back and forth was beyond hysterical. I was surprised I didn't fall down from a chair. By the time I finally stopped laughing, I didn't remember why I was down. I really have to admit that laughter is the best medicine. I still wonder where and how on earth he could come up with such a silly story. Actually though, he wasn't supposed to be in a good mood at that time. He too was dealing with the pain in his knees and starting to give up on the marathon this upcoming November which he had been looking forward to doing. Thankfully it's getting a bit better now and according to his GP, there's still a good chance left for him to run the marathon in November so we are praying his knees get better before it gets too late for training. As for those nasty rashes I've got in my right arm, they are not shingles. I met with another dermatologist this morning because the rashes in my right arm didn't seem to get better although the itching had been gone a couple of days ago. And I was starting to be suspicious of what the first dermatologist told me as it's strange that I ONLY got rashes in my right arm. How could my left arm have avoided the UV rays if it had been exposed like my right arm was? I knew there's a private clinic near my office (like 3 mins away) that was owned by the best dermatologist in Osaka but since I noticed those nasy rashes on my day off, I couldn't be bothered going there especially when my car didn't start and my bike was broken. So I went to the dermatologist near my apartment. BIG MISTAKE!!! This new dermatologist told me that those rashes had absolutely NOTHING to do with the UV rays but were caused by moth larvae. Apparently their poisonous hair was carried by wind and I got it on my right arm. This really makes sense because my boss's mom is really into gardening (she lives on the 5th floor of our office building) so our office is literally surrounded by a whole bunch of flowers, plants and small trees. I remember her complaning about the larvae eating her plants. He prescribed me completely different medicines/creams but warned me that it could take a month for rashes to heal. But at least now I have the right medicines so hopefully they would be gone sooner than he thought they would. Phew, I wrote a year worth post? I hope everyone has a great Thursday. Luv ya all! xo Fumi",

Technically it's still Friday but I'm already home from work and don't go back to work till Monday. I can't believe I will be with Scotty the same time in 4 weeks. I will be arriving in Auckland on Thursday 4th and throwing a small party for the two of us. On Friday he will be taking me to his favourite Belgium restaurant for dinner and a couple of drinks and we will be heading back to home for more drinks. On the first weekend, he will be taking to some major tourist spots like Mt. Eden or One-Tree-Hill and we will  heading down to the middle city for dinner at a revolving resturant in Sky Tower. Then on Monday, we will be going on a getaway to Rotorua www.rotoruanz.com/ and won't be back till Thursday night! This is the hotel he booked for us http://www.millenniumhotels.co.nz/millenniumrotorua/index.html and this is the spa we are going. http://www.polynesianspa.co.nz/                        Other than these, we haven't got any specific plans yet but I'm sure we won't get bored. I can barely wait till he gives me h\\the very first hug at the airport. Gosh, I'll be certainly melting. By the way girls, can you all do me a favor? I have a prayer request. Scotty is having an assessment with his oncologist next Wednesday which makes it Tuesday night in the U.S. He had a follow-up MRI a few weeks ago but hasn't got the results yet. Although we are sure it's a good sign and there wasn't anything that needed to be concerned, I'm getting a bit nervous (He isn't at all.). Plus he is having surgery on 26th. He has 6 titanium screws in his head which used to keep the big chunk of his skull that they opened up for the brain surgery in place while the bone healed. One of the screws seems to be un-doing itself and causing him pain so he needs to have it removed. He tells me not to be worried as it will be just \"day admission\" and performed under a local anesthetic and some sedation but needless to say, I'm worried. Anything that needs your head to be opened seems scary to me. So please girls, keep his in your thoughts and send prayers his way. I would really appreciate it.                               Karen - Oh no, who the feck did give your dad Haldol? I feel for you and your mom. Hoping your dad can go back home soon. By the way, I would love the feeling of knowing I'm with my forever life partner.                          Shirl - I can just picture myself eating chocolate after chocolate after I'm back here from NZ. I will continue with working out and exercises but not sure if I will keep staying under 1400 kcal once I'm back.                           Ulla - Hip Hip Hooray! Yay! I knew it's about time you'd get some good news. I'm so happy for you. Now go celebrate being NED! He's a nice guy.                            Jane - Yep I'm counting. We have 561 hours, 6 minutes and 49 seconds left before we meet in person. The waiting is getting hard really but I know it will be much harder to leave there to be home.                              Sheila - Good luck with the yoga exercise. I have been doing a cardio workout conducted by Charlene Johnson since a couple of months ago and I am starting to like it.                      Jule - Do you lose weight from stress? Wow, I would have been real skinny if I had been like you but sadly I'm the opposite. I do gain too many extra pounds from stress. I seem to take it out on food.                             Valerie - I can't wait to hear more about Pinkstock. I am so happy that you had a lovely time with all the sisters and their family.                                 Judie - {{{{{hugs}}}}} Those risk factors or stupid stats are all bullsh*t so don't read them. Some people get cancer no matter what they eat, what their lifestyles are, how old they are or what they have been through. In other words, the rest of people don't get it no matter how high the risk is for them. Like I always say, your risk of getting new cancer or mets is either 100% or 0%. There's no middle. So why not stick with 0%? I will be sending a lot of benign vibes your way so try not to worry.                                Nancy - I really would love to get some brand-new clothes for my holiday but it's almost impossible to find nice WINTER clothes in the middle of summer!!! September is technically early Spring in NZ but Scotty said it should be still cold. So I'll be going shopping with him once I get there.                               Susan - I'm with you! I couldn't even bring myself to go walking without my mp3 player. Lots of good stuff from 70-80's.                      OK gotta go and do the workout. Hope the pictures I posted gave you some relief from the heat. Have a great day everyone!             xo Fumi",

As some of you know, my dad passed away this past Friday at 6:32am where I live which makes it Thursday night in the U.S. at the age of 84. He had been admitted to the hospital on the 5th of May and dx'd with colon cancer. He had fell into the critital condition and we had been told that he would not make it another day. Well he did make it. He was such a fighter (that's where my \"zillaness\" came from) and had been improving to the point where the doctors had eaten their words and been made to believe that he might make it another couple of years. However he left us behind without even giving us the time to say good-bye. This is what I posted on FB and thought I would share with you all. This is my tribute to my dearest Daddy.                        ------------------------------------------------------- Daddy, you went so quickly. You had finally started eating normal food instead of the fluid on the very night before you left. You had even gone for a short walk in a wheel chair on that day and been looking forward to starting rehab to be able to walk and go home. Only an hour before you were gone, you even talked to the nurse who came to check in on you and you even joked around. Who could have thought that it was going to be the very last time people would see you alive? I am sure that you still don't know why you had to go so I will let you know. Daddy, you really were recovering, recovering to the point where the doctors had eaten their words and told us that you might make it to another couple of years. No doubt about that. So rest assured that you did NOT lose the battle against cancer. Apparently you had developed a blood clot while bedridden in the hospital for the past few months and it caused a sudden heart attack. It was so sudden and you had to leave us at 6:32am on the 24th July before you even knew what was going on. You weren't even given the time to say the last good-bye to us as none of us was able to make it in time. This really sucks but at least you didn't have to suffer and was able to go peacefully without pain. And daddy, don't you think that it must have been NOT like \"the last good-bye\" but like a \"later gator\" with that joking look on our faces because that was just the way we had always been?                   Daddy, believe it or not, I had always been a huge daddy girl. You never knew that because there was a looooooong period when we were literally a dysfunctional family. We kept giving each other so much grief and sorrow, and I ended up leaving home and starting my life by myself at the age of 19. But as the time went by, we managed to put it in the past and retrieved our relationship back. For the past 15 years or so, we have done all sort of silly things together and shared laughter. Even after you became a little demented, you always cared for me and greeted me with that big smile on your face every time I came to see you, which I will always treasure for the rest of my life.                             Damn this really hurts. Daddy, this really does. But I know what you loved the most about me so I will try my best to not cry anymore. You loved joking around with me and we would always try to crack up each other with our silly sense of humor. Daddy, I still do think that I have a better sense of humor than you did. Yours sucked big time I'm telling ya!!! You better brush it up before I join you in Heaven. Daddy, it's just that we can't physically see each other for a while but nothing is going to stop us from being a good pair, right? I ain't say good-bye. I ain't tell you to rest in peace either because that's just not what you would do. Instead, I will tell you to enjoy playing with our beloved doggy Riki till I join you. So, later gator my world silliest Daddy. I love you to bits.                                    Yours always, Foo (that's how you had always called me!)                     -------------------------------------------------------             Hugs, Fumi",

When you are on the message board like here and see someone post the link, look how many posts they have made. If that's their first post or they have only posted the same link over and over (you can see that on their profile page, just click on their name), they are most likely spammers/trolls. You may get infected by viruses there or be added on the mailing list that you would never wish to be listed. Hugs, Fumi",

As I said before, I haven't even taken a single day off since I was dx'd over two years ago except for fun holidays and when I had an appointment for scans or with my oncologist. Yes I did suffer and there were some days when I wanted to stay in my comfy bed but I managed to work full time throughout chemo. Believe me, I even worked overtime till midnight. In fact, there was no way to quit my fulltime job. I got divorced 3 years prior my dx and my parents are too old and don't have that much $$ to financially support me. Plus my private insurance didn't cover any bit of my treatment due to my medical history (huge crap!!!) nor were there any organizations that would help me with $$. I was totally alone in the financial aspect of this journey but I did it. I wonder why they don't even let you give a try to continue working. I have met many women on these boards who managed to work full time. Just because you don't quit your job beforehand doesn't mean you will have to continue working. You could quit it if things didn't work out, right? Of course you don't have to work if that's what you want but having something that keeps you busy helps sometimes. It's all up to you, I never mean to push you to work like crazy. But if you don't want to quit your fulltime job, then it's worth a try? As for those \"what if's\", I know how you must be feeling, poor sweetie. But rest assured you are NOT going to die anytime soon. I personally know a woman who was dx'd with BC mets to her brain 10 YEARS AGO. Mets to brain does sound much worse than deep margins or tumors on the chest wall, doncha' think? So keep your chin up, you will be fine! xo Fumi",
