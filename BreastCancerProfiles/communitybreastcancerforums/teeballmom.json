My GYN called and from what I described to her she believes this may be my last period (where have I heard that before) because the one two days after my surgery was my \"scheduled\" one anyway.  If it goes beyond next Thursday or returns again next month, she is going to run some tests to find out what is happening.  I may ask my ONC about any blood testing her office can do to find out what my estrogen levels are at to ensure they're going down.  I did find some interesting stuff from Dr. Google (I can't remember who on this board came up with that name but I love it) about what is called estrogen withdrawal bleeding that results from the sudden withdrawal of estrogen in the body resulting from a bilateral oophorectomy.  O.K.... I must be losing it if I'm diagnosing myself these days. Well.... I've got to go and start cleaning house.  My mother-in-law is coming for a visit and of course it's one of those weeks when the house went from being clean on Monday to a mess today.  I would like to say I really appreciate all of you.  It's so nice to be part of a group that really understands!",

Last night it was a little heavy on my stomach but knocked me out for a couple of hours.  I'm definitely sleeping a lot, although strange how I'm not feeling tired but apparently my body feels otherwisee.  Tomorrow should be the real question as to how I feel.  Her protocol for my meds stop tomorrow and I only have 1 medication to take and only if I begin to get nauseaous.  Hope that doesn't come on.  I've been drinking lots of green tea and ginger tea and I keep my sea bands on for naseau.  So far the SE's are doable but my little guys are keeping me pretty occupied so I may not be realizing some of them.   Keeping everyone in my thoughts!!!  We're getting through this girls!!!!!!'

Just popping in for a few minutes.   I will say that I had a crummy weekend, but not how you'd think.  Side effects are manageable, and I slept most of the weekend away anyway.  I'd say I was just going to shut my eyes and be out for 2 hours at a time.  One time I woke up 4 hours later. I probably should have thought the whole idea of shaving my head the same weekend as my first treatment a little more.  Too much to take in too quickly, but I'm o.k. today and am sporting a t-shirt turban on my head (it's god awful pink but I bought a bunch of pink t-shirts before my diagnosis and it felt good cutting one up - already sick of pink).  The hardest thing this weekend was facing my 6 and 4 year old boys with my shaved head and my 4 year old son when he looked at me and said \"Mommy, when are you not going to be sick anymore?\"  O.K. I lost it and had to rush upstairs.  My poor husband was trying to console me (and it was his birthday that day) but it made me feel like a failure as a mom.  I know I'm not and I'll be stronger when I'm done, but boy, doesn't that hurt when you unintentionally must be hurting your kids somehow?  As far as the Neulasta shot, my ONC didn't want me to take any Claritin because she is having me journal every day any body aches (and she doesn't want the Claritan to mask anything) so that when I meet with her this Weds, I can tell her how everything went.  For me, if I have any pain, I'm supposed to take 800mg of ibuprofen.  I had my shot last Thurs and so far, I haven't felt any bone pain (knock on some wood).   Sending hugs to everyone and wishing anyone having treatment this week no side effects!!!  Take care.",

O.K. I vented, and feel a little better.  Getting used to the shaved head but boy I have a lot of gray hair.  Scarey!  One good thing I've noticed (and it may be my imagination since it seems a little soon but I'll take it) is that the hair on my legs is not growing back very fast.  Yay!!!!!!  I shaved last Friday and by now I should be hairier than I am. I think part of the reason I've felt pretty good is that I took Madelyn's advice and have been eating smaller meals all day and drinking lots.  I'm so tired of water, so I've been making a big pot of tea in the morning using a caffeine-free peppermint tea bag and a caffeine-free ginger tea bag and then drinking it throughout the day as iced tea when I need a break from water.  Maybe it's also soothing any tummy upset.  Tastes good.  Thank you for all of the encouragement from those further along in your treatments.  I have been stopping in and visiting other groups and can't wait until our July 2012 group can join them in being through chemo and helping others along their journey. Take care and I think I need to go get a hug from my boys.",

I also just wanted to post this quick little blurb for those of us with small children because it made me feel a little better yesterday.  We had an appt with our youngest son's social worker yesterday (he is adopted and annual reports must be sent to his native country) and unknown to us for years, our social worker had been a counselor for cancer patients/survivors as part of her intern work.  She emphasized to me yesterday that what I'm going through right now is just a blip in our childrens' lives and when it's all done, they're not going to remember it.  They remember it as maybe the time when Mommy slept alot or we didn't go anywhere on vacation or in some form like that.  She never mentioned to me that they're resilient, but that at their age (6 and 4) they are not continually focused on Mommy being sick so any emotional toll that I think I'm having on them continuously throughout the day is not really in their reality right now.  It felt so good to have someone sitting down with my DH and I who has experience and training in two areas of concern for our family right now.  She asked such really good questions of each of us to get us talking about how we were handling my diagnosis and put in perspective what is important.  First that it really is about me right now and I shouldn't feel guilty about it.  Second when I voiced concern about how I felt that I was failing as a wife and Mom and the sacrifices everyone was making because of financial costs and emotional tolls of my diagnosis, she told me that most importantly right now is that my husband needs his wife and the boys need their Mom and if we ended up living in a small home, apt, tent, whatever or the kids had to go to the worst ranking school, it wouldn't matter because what really mattered was that I was around.  She also asked would I have the same guilt about finances if it had been one of our children diagnosed with cancer.  Of course I said no, so she asked why I was feeling guilty because it was me.  I'm worth everything that is having to be spent right now, I'm worth everything that we are having to go through right now and I am worth everything that may come at me in the future.  My DH was just looking at me with these loving eyes the entire time.  Almost lost it in front of her, and she said if I have to cry, go ahead and also, not to be afraid to tell people who are trying to turn my diagnosis into their own therapy session right now that this diagnosis is about me, my DH and our boys and if they need consoling, they need to find their own network of friends or family to help them through it.  Wow, yeah I can see myself telling my mother-in-law that.  Not!  LOL.   Anyway, I know I babbled a little, but I really wish that everyone could have a similar sit down with someone trained to listen and ask questions and get things out that are bottled up inside.   This should be a standard with any health insurance policy in my opinion.",

I've been so scared about Taxol next Weds, but I just got off the phone with an acupuncturist my oncologist referred me to for a free accupuncture and massage session next Friday and I'm feeling better about my SE fears.  His experience shows that accupuncture has helped many women with neuropathy (which is my biggest fear) and I'm just so glad I can have this experience to see if it will be any help with SE's from Taxol.  I'm so hesitant to believe that I will not experience any SE's like my ONC says.  I'm hoping, but still really hesitant.   Madelyn:  I feel like I'm putting pressure on you, but I always look to you for your guidance also.   Camp Hilton sounds wonderful!!!! Sounds weird, but my hair is starting to grow.  I told my DH that if it starts to fall out again with Taxol, bring on the razor this time.  Is it just me, or is anyone else more afraid of losing their eyelashes and eyebrows (and I hate my eyebrows) than they were about losing their hair.  I've been o.k. with the hair, but I really don't want to lose my eyelashes.  My cancer center prescribes that eyelash grower that Brooke Shields promoted a while back, but I'm a little hesitant about that.  Maybe I should look into that further.   Take care everyone!!!!",

I'm so sorry you are having a recurrence, but you will be fine!  Will you be having radiation?  I will have A/C x 4 (every 2 weeks), taxol/herceptin x 12 (weekly), herceptin (for a total of one year every 3 weeks) and somewhere between taxol/herceptin and herceptin alone, I will get my radiation treatment.

When I visited the portion of the ONC's office where my infusions will be done (during my class yesterday), the chairs all face the green hills of Monterey, CA.  The first thing that came to mind (it was 5:00 PM and the sun was setting against the windows) was \"Wow, those windows are dirty\".  Isn't that horrible? Not, \"Wow, nice tv's or nice chairs or lots of nurses to keep an eye on everyone\", but I'm looking at exterior window dirt.  Oh well...... Take care everyone!!!",

I didn't get a choice of my chemo drugs.  My oncologist spent a lot of time focusing on what she believes will be the best for me based on my final pathology from my surgery and said that as long as I do as she tells me, my prognosis is very good.  With those words, there was no hesitation on my part to do anything other than what she told me to do.  She did put me in contact with a pharmacist who does integrative therapy using supplements for people going through chemo therapy and I meet with him on Monday.  He's going to advise me on the natural supplements I can take (in addition to the meds my oncologist will prescribe for side effects) to help with side effects and others for making me feel better during my therapy.  I'm excited to meet with someone who not only knows about prescription medications (40+ years experience) but someone who knows about vitamins and herbs, too.

It's just like he said.  I know something is there but it's not bothersome or anything like that.  The only achiness I felt was the day of surgery and that was in my left arm, but I'm sure that was from the anesthesia and by the next morning that achiness was gone.  Good luck on your port surgery.  The anticipation is by far the worst part of it. Cjanet:  That's what I worry about, too.  The WBC dropping and me ending up in the ER.  But I'll do what my ONC said and call if I get a fever of 100.4 or more. I purchased the Sea Bands yesterday at Target for nausea.  For $8, I'll try anything to hopefully keep the nausea at bay next Weds.  I'll wear them 24/7 if I have to. So I have decided that I will have my DH shave off my hair this coming Friday (my 1st chemo date is 7/11).  Our little guys had their heads shaved yesterday and they asked if I was going to have mine done with them, too (they're excited to cut my hair as best they can beforehand).   I just couldn't do it last night, but.... I am 95% sure about this Friday.  I decided that chemo is not going to decide when my hair is gone, but I will.  I hope I stay strong about my decision.  Take care everyone!",

I jump on to read but feel that yucky cold feeling so I am not posting much Also at our boys school the parents have to volunteer a lot so I volunteered to be their Parent Club treasurer. Well,I think it has been so good for me by keeping my mind off BC but it feels like a job. It's the only volunteering I have to do but what is that old saying? No good deed goes unpunished? It is taking up more time than it was supposed to. LOL. I shouldn't complain because I am grateful they created this specific position for me. I probably would not complain too much if I just felt better. Hopefully this weekend I can get back on these boards and wish everyone encouragement during their journey. Oh yeah. I set up my plastic surgeon appt so my ONC won't yell at me for at least not speaking with him before radiation begins. Still not convinced to have implants but I will speak with him. Take care everyone.",

Boobzilla:  You are so right about perspective being a funny thing. Well.... this Wednesday is AC #3 for me.  I can hardly wait to get AC over with.  It'll be 3 down and 1 to go after Wednesday and I've already been scheduled for my 12 Taxol & Herceptin and my tentative graduation date for that is Nov 21, 2012.  I will continue Herceptin every 3 weeks after that for a year, but at least the weekly stuff will be over by then. I already see that faint light in the distance having that date now (and hopefully I don't have any infusion dates pushed back during that time), and hopefully during Christmas, I will be able to eat a tasty dinner.  Hoping that is the case with Thanksgiving, but since the 12th infusion is the day before, well....... you know. I am not going to miss the nasty taste in my mouth. DH went and purchased me some ginger ale last night because I just couldn't drink any more water.  So right now, it's all kinds of iced tea, ginger ale and the occassional snatch of grape juice from the 2 little guys in my life.   The hair is gone in patches on my head, and what's left is the little bit of fuzz from when my DH shaved my head again a couple of weeks ago.  Being Asian I have that coarse hair and it's like little needles on my head when I run my fingers over it.  My two little ones said that my hair was cutting them the other day when I rubbed it against their cheeks by accident. Ouch!!! Hoping everyone who is getting a treatment this week has minimal or non-existent SE's.  Take care everyone!!!",

      "Content": "Sep 6, 2012 01:15PM - edited Sep 6, 2012 01:20PM by teeballmom Hi everyone. Had my first taxol/herceptin yesterday. Going in I was feeling that nervous nausea you can get when you're about ready to give a speech, and then of corse didn't eat or drink much. My onc could tell (geez) so I got a little lecture that I didn't drink enough water and I was slightly anemic, may WBC were good. Yay!! They first gave me a steroid and 50 mg of Benadryl through my IV. I will say the Benadryl was the worst part. Although I didn't get any reaction during infusion from the taxol, my left leg got that really tired feeling from the Benadryl and I couldln't get comfortable. I did sleep off and on but I'm remembering why I don't like Benadryl. My head felt so apart from my whole body. Anyway, After all was done I was kept for an additional half hour for observation, but I'm not sure if it is because of the taxol or herceptin. They just spent the time giving me additional hydration through my IV. I was so ready to leave that right on the dot I rang my bell to leave. We had to go get our boys from after school care and I was so ready to leave. I will say there is absolutely no way I will be able to drive myself home, too woozy. So I just woke up and I'm feeling really good so far. I did take some Ativan last night to make sure I slept through the night because of the steroids from yesterday. Tomorrow I'll post how that went. My onc insisted I shouldn't have any side effects which will be great. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. Take care and wishing luck to everyone in the BGC this week and no/minimal side effects for all.",

Only 6 more Taxol to go and completing Herceptin (either weekly like now or ever 3 weeks)!!!!  My echocardiogram I took last Thursday reflects my heart has not changed at all since the baseline echocardiogram they took in June.  Another Yay!  I was so worried that there would be a change and I wouldn't be able to continue Herceptin as a result. I just heard something sweet yesterday.  Our 2 little ones attend a Catholic School (the public schools are horrific in our area, and since both had experienced some delays as a result of arriving in the U.S. without our language skills, etc.. we decided that at least for a few years we wanted them in smaller classrooms to get some one-on-one attention and attending school a little longer each day). Well, each morning they have a morning prayer and I was told by one of the teachers yesterday that each morning the entire school says a prayer for me and the thought is how could prayers not be answered when they're coming from these sweet little voices.  Oh Geez!  The waterworks wanted to start so I had to leave.  It was the best start to sitting in the BGC. Take care everyone!",

My fear is that it was strep since it is making its rounds around our 2 little ones' school but thankfully it isn't. My ONC put me on antibiotics just to take care of any infection. Slight fever,etc.... So she wanted to take a conservative approach. Hoping everyone has a great week and take care.",

It just hasn't left me much time to get on the computer. Well today was my last radiation treatment. I was supposed to be done sooner but I was given a short 3 day break due to a small area of skin that was starting to break down. I got to ring this huge marine bell today, the dept. put up a huge congratulations sign and I got hugs from the ONC and there must have been at least 10 people clapping for me (some of them other patients I saw everyday who will be finishing their treatments next week). I am extremely excited to get some of my life back again. I will just be receiving my Herceptin now every 3 weeks. Definitely doable. The hospital I went to for rads has encouraged me to attend their cancer wellness program they offer for free which talks about diet, exercise and just dealing with the emotional side of surviving. Sounds really good. Hoping everyone is doing well. Take care.",

Fredig2:  Glad your first infusion went well!  Cityfi:  Sounds like our treatments are the same except I will be receiving Herceptin with my Taxol.  Although I'm HER2-, there is a 2nd number they look at and I qualify for it. Tab55:  We're starting on the same date.   So had my port consult today and I get my port in on July 5th.  They originally had me scheduled on July 12th (which didn't make sense because everyone told them I start chemo on July 11th) and luckily someone cancelled so I replaced her on the 5th.  My BS said everything looks good and my arteries are in perfect alignment for my port but if not he has another option closer to my neck.  Yuck!!! I met with a pharmacist today who now consults about supplements and herbs and nutrition.  I won't post about it here because it relates more to the complementary alternative group, but I feel so positive about everything he said, what I'm currently taking and those items that I will be purchasing.  It all comes down for me to being able to function as normal as possible since we have a 6 and a 4 year old who are like the Energizer bunny (I can't wait until school starts on 8/16 - isn't that horrible to think).  They keep going and going and going nonstop.  I will say the pharmacist was very adamant about staying positive and viewing the chemo as not the enemy (hard for me to do but I'm working on it) but as a partner (I can't remember now the perfect wording he used, but he meant a partner) in killing the cancer cells.  He recommended really focusing on this while the infusion is occuring.  I think someone in one of the chemo groups mentioned visualizing the chemo as the Navy Seals swimming through the bloodstream and attacking those abnormal cells while she's sitting in the Big Girl Chair.  Definitely something I am going to do.   Wishing everyone who is beginning treatment this week that everything goes well and that your SE's are non-existent or extremely minimal. Take care. ",

Soltantio:  I decided on a Weds chemo date so I can get my Neulasta shots on a Thursday and then if I start getting any SEs maybe they'll hit Friday night/weekends while my husband is home so he can focus on our 6 and 4 year olds and then I can be good to go on Monday.  That was just my train of thought and my the triag nurse seemed to think it would work best with our little ones. So I got my port today on my left upper chest/shoulder area.  Not the big deal I thought it was going to be, but my left arm feels like I've just worked out at the gym with 100 lb weights (not like I can do that anyway on a good day) so my husband and I are thinking it's from the anesthesia because the aching is more around the area where the IV went in. I'll live with that.  My BS said if I feel any discomfort it'll start tomorrow because of how much he numbed around the port area, so I'm good with that, too. Right now I'm waiting to see if my GYN calls me back today.  I had my ovaries and tubes removed at the same time as my BMX on 5/29 and since then I've had 2 regular periods, which is not normal (according to her when I called her exchange yesterday to speak with her and the 24/7 nurse through my insurance company).  I was just spotting yesterday, but I was supposed to call her today if I actually had a cycle and sure enough when I woke up this morning SURPRISE!!!  Oh well...... Will call her tomorrow again if she doesn't call me back.  Maybe my ONC doesn't know what to say, but my ONC is not going to like this turn of events when she sees me next week.  I love my ONC because if the GYN doesn't deal with it, I know she will.",

So far so good with this first infusion except I have brusitis caused by over doing it after the port was put in last week. Probably from my Costco trip the day after. Well, a girl has got to shop. I will say that make sure you bring some snacks. Luckily I did and I am starving! So first they flushed my port. Then they started my first nausea medication (about 20 minutes) and then set up a saline bag and then started my next bag of nausea meds (about 30 minutes) and the my next bag of nausea meds will start and then the chemo drugs. The saline bag is to flush the chemo drugs through. My doctor has already come by and checked up on me. I didn't expect that after seeing her in her office already. The anticipation of this day was worse than what I'm feeling right now. Kill those rogue cancer cells!!! Excited is not the best word to use but it feels better knowing I'm in treatment doing something than just waiting. And I have a gorgeous view of the Monterey rolling hills right now. Not sure how long I'll be here today. They just brought me some pretzels! Yummy my favorite kind, too. Well, I think I'm going toread for awhile. Take care everyone! Definitely not bad although I have to say I'm probably the youngest in the room.",

      "Content": "Jul 12, 2012 05:16PM - edited Jul 13, 2012 07:52AM by teeballmom Hi Everyone. So yesterday I had my first AC x 4 treatment.  Went well, although the 1 1/2 hour drive home was awful.  I was so tired.  Will probably make several stops on the way home the next time for something to drink that will keep me more alert.  Maybe a chocolate milkshake (small of course , LOL). I have such a fuzzy brain today.  Can't type worth anything and sometimes what comes out of my mouth is weird so I really have to be careful when speaking. So Day 2 today and I started the regin of nausea meds my doctor scheduled for me.  She was very strict how I take them.  I can feel the wooziness, but I'll wooziness over queazy any time. I take Decadron and something call Lopra.... something or other (1 each) with breakfast, and (1 each) at 3:00 pm with a snack and then (2) of the Lopra.... before I go to bed.  So I do this Day 2, Day 3, and Day 4 (she wrote the dates down for me).  Then this Sunday I have a 3rd bottle of nausea meds that I am only to take if I get nausea, since some people do get it and some people dont.  She was very amadant that I take the meds exactly as she said for the most benefit.  No problem.   I went in for the Neulasta shot today.  Nobody wants me to take the Claritin since it may blanket other symptoms I may be having.  The ONC said that the bone pain will more than likely be in my lower back and my sternum but 800 mg of ibuprofen will take care of the pain, and I shouldn't be in pain longer than a few days.  Pain would start approximately in 7 days.  If my pain lasts longer, I need to call her office immediately.  Next week I have a meeting with the ONC to go over all of my symptoms or body changes that I'm writing down in a little journal so she can see if there are some changes she may make to my treatment. Best of luck to everyone going into the Big Girl Chair tomorrow.   Take care.",

Well, my 4th and final AC this Wednesday. I will be glad.  I've been told my taste buds should recover, and I really hope so.  I can taste some things pretty well, but that metal taste won't go away no matter if I use plastic utensils, constantly brush my teeth or rinse with salt & baking soda or Biotene.  Yuck!   Wishing everyone the best who are having treatments this week.   Take care.",

So on top of everything else, my DH was in a car accident a few weeks ago (sideswiped by an uninsured & unlicensed driver here in CA) and our insurance company totalled the car.  Yeah, so on top of Taxol tomorrow, we've got to go find a new (meaning new or used) car for us by next Tuesday so he can turn in the rental.  I'm just so grateful he was not hurt.  The other driver hit the car really good, he ended up going through a ditch and traveling another 150 feet before his car stopped.  Everyone is amazed the car didn't flip over when it hit the ditch.  Unfortunately, we're upside down on the car, and when my DH called the finance company to see if they would discount what we are upside down on, they gave him a sales pitch on how they can work with him and just add what is owed onto a new loan if we go with the same make.  I even told him to try and use my BC as a sympathy measure but no deal.  Oh well... I told him it didn't hurt to try.  The answer is always no if you don't ask.  He's so stressed.  Me, not so much, but I think it's just because he wasnt' hurt and well, with everything all of us ladies must pay out for our treatments and everything, what's another several thousand on top of that.  Honestly, what are we gonna do? Oh yeah, I emailed my herbalist/pharmacist and he said he wants me to take B-6, L-glutamine and continue taking my green tea and alpha lopic acid for helping with any neuropathy I may get from Taxol.  I actually have to break down all of my supplements and take them over a period of 3 meals because I can't for the life of me get everything down in one sitting.  I'm grateful for this gentleman, just feeling like a walking pill bottle by the end of the day.  LOL. Hoping everyone is doing well and Take Care.  ",

As Madelyn mentioned I got restless leg syndrome during the Benadryl the first time. What they did yesterday is increased the nfusuin time from 30 minutes to 45 minutes and it helped a lot. Thank goodness. With my Taxol I get a bag with 50 mg of Benadryl combined with decadron then when that is done they give me a bag go Zantac. I am in and out of sleep but never completely out of it (at least yesterday I wasn't). I was listening to an older man's conversation with another patient and he had such a calming voice I was enjoying his voice. Very interesting since I thought I was only among a few that no linger plan for the future and just live day by day. This man does the same thing but he said it in such an eloquent way. Come to find out he was a Humanities Professor years ago. I can just imagine listening to a voice like that in class. It would have lulled me to sleep every day. Anyway, this Taxol/Herceptin ionfusion went well except I am now anemic. The ONC does not want me to get my transfusion so I am being recommended to drink homemade bone marrow beef soup and eat more of my grass fed organic beef we have on hand. I'll do anything except eat liver to get this rbc counts up. Madelyn: I had the Japanese acupuncture last Friday. I felt so good afterwards but will need to save up if I want to go again. $90 for each visit is not doable right now. Lots of school expenses for our little ones already. Good luck to everyone receiving treatment this week and no/minimal side effects. Take care.",

I'm finding out that our family has extended family we are unaware of who are helping us out anonymously.  An anonymous family at our boys' school has donated funds to cover the cost of our boys going to summer school for 6 of the days I will be in treatment and when I have to go in for my Neulasta shots.  I started to cry when I found out.  People are really amazing!",

As far as supplements go, everyone needs to do what their ONCs say.  If your ONC says no, that means NO.  Some of mine were a definite DOUBLE NO and some are not, but I have a pharmacist who is part of my team and I wouldn't be taking any if he wasn't on board.  Supplements during treatment are not to be treated lightly (just my opinion) because some can make some chemo not as effective.   Take care.",

Taxol has been very doable and now they reduced my Benadryl from 500 mg to 250 mg. I can actually function and speak clearly with the nurses without my brain taking a vacation. I think I have been lucky with side effects but I take a lot of supplements. And my iron levels went up 2 points. I am still below the lowest normal by 2 points but next week we will see. Starting yesterday my iron protocol from the ONC is to take 2 iron pills. Hoping everyone is doing well. Take care.",

She had I think less than 100 cancer cells ( I want to say they said around 40 or so but I know it was less than 100) in the path report but she is on Tamoxifen for 5 years now. Her doctor mentioned to her at the meeting when she asked about prognosis that he has only seen a few cases like hers and one woman is doing good after 15 years. Still did not mention what stage but I would assume maybe Stage 1. She was at a BC event hosting it in Denver and the show caught her breaking down a couple of times. I started breaking down when I was watching the luncheon with some survivors and those still in treatment. A blogging friend just posted on her site that a friend was just diagnosed with a rare form of BC. I read her message in the BGC yesterday. I almost lost it right there in the treatment room.

My rads ONC told me that side effects would begin about the 1/2 way point through treatment and it would include fatigue and pink or redness. I am being treated over the right breast area down along the side and up near the collar where there are some lymph nodes. Some of the armpit area is being treated also. I am having 33 treatments which include 5 boosts that they explained are condensing the area being treated to the just the tumor field. Now he did mention that as far as side effects, he didn't believe I would really be affected by the fatigue because the fatigue from the rads would feel like a walk in the park in comparison to the fatigue from the chemo. We'll see....... As far as the pink/redness, I am slightly olive skinned so they really don't know how my skin will be affected. The assumption is that I may not be affected as much as someone fair skinned but they also told me that they have seen olive skinned women who have really turned red during the treatment. I was also told that just like chemo, everyone is affected differently and there is no way to know how each persons body will react, but it will definitely be easier than chemo. They are watching me carefully and I meet with the rads ONC every week and he is readily available at any time for his patients. I am being treated at a hospital so there are several rads Onc's on site at all times. It is comforting since it is the same as my med Onc's office where there are always several Onc's on site during chemo treatment. I hope I have not been too long winded in my response. Take care!",

They also are not confirming any of my treatments until the results are in in case changes have to be made. What???? My ONC did say she didn't think it is anything serious because when she looked at my CAT scan results from a few months ago it didn't reflect anything in the bones. I am glad she is being proactive but I am so tired of BC being the gift that keeps giving. First the BC, then the thyroid nodules and now this. Crap!!! I want to believe her that it is nothing but I think back a year ago when I first knew something was wrong and I couldn't get any of the doctors I went to to get it right and by the time I found a doctor 6 months later who said I had BC my tumor had doubled in size. Everything has been going pretty good so far and I've been feeling that things have been maybe going a little too good. Oh well. Thanks for listening and have a great weekend.

In regards to my HER2 status, what my ONC said was that even though my testing came back that I am HER2 negative, my HER2 Copy Number was greater than 6.0 (mine was 6.2) so I am eligible for the Heceptin treatment (and my ONC said it will be part of my treatment).  I am glad she is looking at everything and just wish it was Monday already so I could find out what my treatment plan will be.

I'm so sorry you're dealing with this and completely understand being afraid of the test results.  Each time I have a test, I'm terrified that they're going to find something else new in some other part of my body.  I had a mammo in October 2011 and like you, was told I was 100% fine, in addition to being told on two thermograms (Nov 2011 and March 2012) that I was fine - just a lot of cysts.  Thank goodness I went with my gut feeling (I'm afraid of what would be the results if I had accepted what those results reflected) and 6 months later my mammogram (at a different mammography center) showed the 5 cm tumor, which when going back and reviewing my Oct reports from the other center, my new radiolgist saw that it showed the tumor was 1/2 the size 6 months prior.  It's totally o.k. to cry and be angry and the women and men on this board will help you through it.  I'd like to invite you over to the Starting Chemo July 2012 group.  It's a wonderful group and we'll all get through our treatment together.  It's a fantastic place to vent.  Trust me, they've all been there and can completely relate and there's no judgement.

I did order 3 hats already because I don't want to wear a wig and have to maintain it (I am very lazy about my own hair and just imagine I would let a wig get really nasty so best probably not to have one), but with that said, the hospital I go to has free wigs and hats that they give their cancer patients, so in case I change my mind, I do have that option available at least.  Our 6 and 4 year old know that Mommy is going to lose her hair and they are excited about helping Mommy cut her hair off the day I ask DH to shave it.  We told them that I will have my hair shaved like we shave theirs but just more will be taken off from Mommy's head than theirs.   They've even offered to paint my head pink, red and black (not sure why these colors) and then said when they're done, I can wash the colors off.  I'm amazed how resilient they really are.  They ask me quite a lot of questions when I go to the doctor, but they seem to take everything in stride. Depending on my treatment schedule, though, we may put them into summer school full time so they're kept busy during the summer and don't have to hang around me all day, especially if I don't have an easy time with SE's.  I really like the nurses I've met at the ONC's office.  This is our 3rd visit with her so I'm getting to know her nurse really well, although I doubt she'll be the one administering to me (I wish).",

After surgery the best advice I have about what to wear is button-up shirts.  The first time I tried to pull a camisole over my head I laughed the whole time because it took FOREVER and I still couldn't put it on.  I finally had to call my DH to help me.  Those who have had TE's can help you out more with what types of bra or support that worked best for them.

It looks like my surgery will take place sometime in May, probably during the last week.  Having a BMX without reconstruction; however, I promised my BS that I would speak with the plastic surgeon he recommended since he said I'm so young not to have it (I'm 46 - nice to have someone say that).  He's also pushing for my ONC to write a letter to the insurance company trying to get approval for the genetic testing, which he said after having the blood drawn, takes a couple of weeks for results (which we would then have the results for before surgery).  Still getting my CAT scans tomorrow.  Can't wait for most of this testing to be done.  Just want to get the twins removed now. Also, we have to find someone who can come up to take care of our 6 and 4 year old.  The last week of May is also their last week of school and I can't believe how many activities they have going on.  Memorial Day weekend we're heading out camping and the boys have been waiting for this since I made the reservations last summer.  Definitely going to have fun before surgery!  ",

Therefore,I went outside of my dental insurance and went to someone over by my breast care center instead. I'll mention this to my BS today and if he recommends, I'll find another oral surgeon to get it done faster.  ",

Take care.",
