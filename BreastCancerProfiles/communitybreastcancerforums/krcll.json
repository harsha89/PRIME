So I would like to find an organization to donate to that I know will use the money to support metastatic BC reasearch. Any ideas?

I feel lucky when I see that other women have had quite a hard time. By coincidence, this evening is my very last day of taking the horse pills. Scary.

Any time I need to use a bra that covers as little as possible (but still covers the neccessary!) I use the Lara. And it is cute! It almost looks like a normal bra.

If I tuck in my breast form in one of my old bras now, half of it is sticking out of the bra. Are the \"normal\" bras that you sew a pocket into quite full-coverage or does the pocket (and form) stick partially out of the cup? I've always thought that mastectomy bras are relatively big in order to cover all that cleavage that isn't there anymore. Erica- I love your bra lists. I have just ordered the Anita Gloria and Amoena Jada on the recommendation from your website (if I remember correctly....). I also bought the Nastasja on your recommendation. The only thing with that one, along with the Lara,  is that I find the cup a little small for my form. I think I am going to get a breast form that is slightly smaller for both the Nastasja and Lara bras. My remaining breast seems to be between to breast form sizes so I could go either way. ",

It sounds like the silicone pools down to the bottom inside of your foob and that really isn't supposed to happen. With my silicone foob, the silicone stays put within the form. Why don't you go to a real mastectomy store and try some on to get a feel of if the foob you have is normal? Also, if you find another type you like, you could look for them online and buy them when they are on sale. I used the fiber-fill forms for many months and didn't think the silicone would make a difference, but I LOVED it when I got it. It looked so much more real and felt better. I understand you have issues with LE, so that makes things different. Good luck in finding a solution!",

But maybe next time you will know more about which meds help you best with the side effects? I hope that you will be feeling better tomorrow... London-Victoria- I just want you to know that I will be thinking about you tomorrow when you get your first chemo. I'm sure you will have a fantastic team around you, like mrsb45 seems to have had. That is the most important. All the best with managing the side effects. Just remember that Admiral Lord Nelson and Codrington are on your side! delaine- It is funny how everyone is so concerned about the surgery, but don't seem so concerned about the chemo or rads. I suppose that getting a breast cut off is so dramatic for most people that it is hard to realize that other things are, in the end, harder to tackle. I have to say that I have been open  at work about why I am away (or rather, I told 5 people and within 1 week 125 people knew.....) and everyone has been incredibly supportive and nice. I know they don't really understand even if they want to, so I expect them to lose interest just about the time I need the most support.... Also, I am thinking having cancer might be like when I went through a divorce- I was always able to \"pull myself together\" at the beginning, but as time went on I had less and less energy to manage things. I just got run down. Even when I was \"done\" with the divorce I then had to build myself up again. It is hard for anyone on the outside to realize how it really is. But then that is why we are here for each other. WE understand! newtonville- I just got my first scarves from headcovers.com. 4 days from the States to Norway! They are beautiful scarves and a nice size. They have a great selection. I have ordered 1 or 2 scarves from 6 different places, so I would in ANY case find something that worked for me. I will keep you updated as to how it goes.",

I thought about you the whole day of your chemo and sent all the best thoughts I could over the North Sea right to the cancer center in the heart of London where you were. I'm crossing my fingers that you might be one of the lucky ones that doesn't get hit so hard with the side effects.... When you are feeling well enough just stick your head in and give us a \"hi\" so that we know you are alright. This thread isn't quite the same without you here ;-) Jane_in_UK- Thanks so much for popping in and showing us that we can get through this! Before we all start there are lots of nerves, trying to get ready for battle but not really knowing what to expect. It really is helpful to remember that we WILL get to the end of treatment! With the FEC chemo were you working? If you worked some times, how much were you at home and when were you good enough to go back to work?  tamlyn110- I see you will be having your port put in tomorrow. Good luck with that! I've seen that many women love their ports (their words, not mine!) so hopefully you will have the same feeling. Are you awake while they do it?  delaine- I don't have \"electric shock\" feelings like you do. Could that be nerves growing back? But I thought that would be a little later. I only had a mast on my left side but I certainly can relate to the \"iron bra\" feeling- poor you with this feeling on both sides! I try really hard to stretch every time I can because I figure we have only one chance to make sure we heal in a \"stretched out\" way. Once we are totally healed it will be harder to stretch things out. Anyway, that's how I imagine it is. My nurse has convinced me to take pain medication again- that if I do I will use my arms more normally and get back to 100% sooner than if I feel a little pain and don't use my arm as much. They keep telling me to take pain medication (Paracetamol) before I feel anything. I wore a soft (nursing!) bra first after the operation but found that it irritated the skin where the drain used to be. Now I mostly just safety pin the fiberfill prosthetic into a cami and just hope that it will hold itself more or less in the right place under my shirt! I am mostly very sensitive in my armpit after the SND. When will you know about your chemo? I will see my surgeon to get the path report on 1. Sept then after that I will get to talk to the chemo people. mrsb45- Great to hear that you felt so much better on day 2! I so hope that you are still doing so well. We \"chemo virgins\" are really rooting for you \"experienced\" ladies who are leading the way.  Welcome MN-Jeanne!  That's great that you aren't too freaked out. Denial is absolutely a good quality to have, I think! I am the type that has to obsessively read about everything to have everything in \"control\"- but of course there is never any way to have much at all in control.... So denial is a much better coping mechanism if you can keep it up! Welcome MarieK and unklezwifeonty! Let's just hope it really is like everyone says- it is doable and the worst part is not knowing what to expect. I guess by October we all will know!",

That means that people invite to Thanksgiving dinner just on any day that suits them. So this year I lucked out and was invited to TWO Thanksgivings this weekend!!!! In my opinion, the only thing better than Thanksgiving, is two Thanksgivings! Of course, my jeans have also somehow shrunk twice as much as usual....",

I live in Oslo but am american. I studied in London and am often in the UK. Actually, I was supposed to fly there today but had to cancel because of the operation. I LOVE your image of your father leading the entire British navy (marine?) throughout the ages to fight on your behalf! I read a study that said those with a \"fighting spirit\" had a better prognosis than those that \"stoically accepted\" the cancer. I would say you are doing well on that account! Interestingly, those that were in denial and didn't want to admit they had cancer also had better prognosis'. I suppose the most important element is a positive attitude- based on reality or not.  I also have had my Dad watching over me, but in a more modest way (he was a concert pianist, so his colleagues wouldn't be as helpful as your Dad's...). He passed away after a long illness in June and I still have a little pouch of some of his ashes with me that I will later spread in his home town. When I went to the hospital for the operation I took the pouch with me so he could make sure everthing went alright. I don't know if that sounds weird but I've always been a Daddy's girl so it helped me out. Maybe my Dad could play concerts on the ships before the big battles to help calm the sailors nerves and help with morale? Do you think that would be good? My surgeon said I would also have FEC. What does the 75 mean? I will have to check about the cold cap treatment at my hospital.  Otherwise, I've been thinking about just buying some cheap scarves and using that to hide my bald head. I've done alot of research on the internet and there are a million cool ways to tie scarves so I thought I would try to make the chemo treatment into a creative fashion statement. On the other hand, I might feel so ill that it is all I can do to get a scarf stuffed onto my head any which way! I also had thoughts of making a henna \"tattoo\" on my head. I don't know if that is too rock 'n roll/Hells Angels or not. I'm a classical musician so I always have to consider how things look with an evening gown on ;-) Are you from originally from London? I've spent alot of time in Cornwall and London and have done alot of travelling around in the UK.  All the best wishes for beginning your chemo! Sorry that you have to be first out, but we (I...) will be coming along soon. But then you also will be first finished ;-)",

I felt really guilty about leaving you all when I was the one that started the thread, so I didn't feel like I could just pop back in without an explanation.

Just remember when you are feeling bad, you will only feel better and better.....for the rest of your life!!! Scoobydoo- I'm doing fine. I'm going to try working every other week, so we'll see how it goes. I was a little more tired and achey after Taxol 2 than Taxol 1, and wonder how it will develop. No neuropathy yet and the nails are looking good. Mostly I'm just tired of always having the chemo define my life. I figure I'm not done with rads until May... One step at a time.

      "Content": "Aug 29, 2009 12:26AM krcll wrote: Hi there again! I didn't mean to ignore everyone, but I had a complete meltdown for a few days  and just had to regroup. I'm feeling better now. What happened is that I got impatient waiting for my path report after my operation on Aug. 6 (mast on left, lump on right, SN, supposedly clear, on both sides). My surgeon is on vacation so I got the surgeon on duty to look at the SN report (the path from the breasts hadn't come yet) and she said they found 5 mm. of cancer in the left sentinal node, growing into the capsule and I would need to be operated again to now get all the lymph nodes on that side. They found less than 20 cells in the right SN and they were not going to do anything with that. I am a string player and I have practiced hours and hours a day since I was 5 years old- I work hours and hours and hours a day being a musician- most of my friends are musicians- frankly, I'm not even sure how the non-musician world works! Well, I might be exaggerating a little, but the point is that my entire identity is tied up to playing my instrument and I need my arms to work without any problems. Not just without problems, but in top form. My arms and fingers are to me what legs are to a sprinter- things are very finely balanced and trained and the slightest change can upset my whole way of playing.  I am already having some problems with my left arm after my mast and SN and I completely lost it when they said they wanted to do a axilles disection. Isn't it very strange that they found 5 mm. in the sentinal node after the operation, while during the operation when they did a freeze cut (transl from norwegian...) it looked fine? That seems like SO much! Now, I could have misunderstood because it was on the phone and I was in shock- maybe she said .5 mm. But \"my\" cancer nurse at the same hospital also said she understood that it was 5 mm. Has anyone heard of 5 mm in the SN going unoticed until later? Apart from the whole musician/arm/lymphedema thing, I also worry that 5 mm in a lymph node is so much that it means they will find lots of affected lymp nodes when they go in. I really thought I was going to be stage !, but now I am at least stage IIa and could easily tip over to IIb. I will be seeing my surgeon (who is  probably now sitting on some beach in the Maldives with a Maguarita....) on Tuesday and will get the whole story. They operate only on Wednesdays so I am taking my toiletries with me and demand that he operates on me the next day! I've been waiting a month and will now have to wait another month before I start chemo. As much as I dread it, I want to start chemo! Otherwise, I will have to start a \"Starting chemo October 2009\" thread.... So, this is me in an OK mood- now you all know why I didn't write a few days ago ;-) London-Virginia- What a detailed report of your first chemo day- it really helps for us others to know what to expect! I am so impressed how you keep walking and doing normal things. I am sure you will fare better through all of this than if you just hid under the duvet. I have been writing down all your tips (and those of others) religiously  and you have inspired me to get a pedometer to try walking 10,000 steps a day. Well, maybe I'll start with 5,000.... Great news about the honey dressings- that must be an enormous relief for you! If they ever get done removing things from my body, I will probably be joining you with FEC. Do you know if there are any problems with neuropathy? I haven't really seen any mention of it with FEC. If there aren't, I will ask for the cold cap. Are you keeping your hair? I suppose you will know for sure in 5 or 6 days. Here's crossing my fingers! Delaine- I don't know for sure that there is a short time of getting stretched out, it is just my theory. But you can see from what I wrote above how worried I am about my arms. I stretch my arms out in every which way about 80 times a day, so I could be overdoing it, too ;-) Since you are seeing the onc Sept 10, does that mean you will be starting chemo soon? Does it feel alright to get going with things or will you be asking for London-Virginia's unused ticket to South America?  Myself, I seem to always be surprised at how I feel. One day I am handling it fantastically well and am strong and then a little bad news makes me cry 3 days on end. Maybe it gets more stable when we get used to cancer being a \"normal\" part of our lives.  Vlday- Welcome to our month. It sounds like your doctors have been on vacation with my doctors! Things do go slower in the summer. It sounds like a very good decision to take a leave of absence. Good luck with your port placement. I've read several places that women are very happy having one so I hope you will feel the same! As for a name for the month, do you want to start with a suggestion? It's a great idea. MN-Jeanne- I am sorry to hear about your slipping denial-I suppose it was bound to happen. Yes, it does seem to take a long time to get the stamina back. We really just have to let our bodies tell us how much we manage and give it time. If you have only had one meltdown so far then I am really amazed! I would say I have had 3 three-day meltdowns in 6 weeks and I was thinking that I was holding it together! Go ahead and meltdown as much as you need to- now and then you really are allowed to say \"poor me\". But I will try a little more to follow your inspiring example of \"if I don't think it will hurt, then it won't.\"  mrsb45-  Thanks so much for all your updates! You seem to be managing relatively well and even going to the gym already! Wow! I hope your blood counts are OK. MarieK- I hope you are healing well. I had my mast and SN on Aug 6, the day before you. I will be having the axilles disection in a few days. Can you tell me where the incision is? Have you had alot of pain from that part of the healing? I read on another thread that you are having some cording. Get to a Lymphedema specialist right away! As I understand it, the key to avoiding lymphedema is to make sure you get treatment right from the beginning. I have read that cording is a sign that one can have a pre-disposition for LE.  I found a LE society where I live and they had a list of PTs that are specialists in my area. I will have an appointment a week after my surgery.  But then I am a real worry wort about it... In Norway, PT to prevent LE is covered by the system for breast cancer patients. Is it for you? About wigs, I read that it is best to buy it before you lose your hair in case they need to order it. Don't know if that applies to where you live. It also might be less traumatic to know that the wig is sitting there ready to be used when that first hair falls out. I don't know which chemo you are on, but with FEC I think hair starts to fall out around day 12. Maybe they have the cold-cap that London-Virginia is talking about so you don't have to lose your hair? One more question for the onc! Carcharm-Talk about having a rough time with everything you have been going through! And being worried about losing your job if you take too much time free- it must really be hard! It is now day 5 of your TCH round, so I hope you are over the worst. If you get a moment, please tell us how you are doing and know that this is the perfect place to rant like a lunatic bacause we are all there at some time or other. BoyMom_2009- Welcome! I hope your surgery went well. I will hopefully be having my second surgery on Sept 2, so we can keep each other company on the healing front while the others here race off doing their chemo. Hopefully it will be like being the last ones in the high diving board line- after you have seen 10 others jump off and survive the fall, you may still be terrified but you just want to get down in the water with all your friends, so it really is OK to jump.  tamlyn110- How are you doing there? Not too long before you can take that shower ;-)  Neece- Welcome to you too. Sorry to hear the surgery healing is taking it's time. You had an mast 8 yrs ago, but is this your first time with chemo? It is wonderful that you have such a supportive family. I often think of those that have to go through this more alone than alot of us here. jennsdogs- Have we lost you to our thread? You should be having your chemo about now.  I hope you are doing well. Great to hear about you all! We will and are getting through this and it is SO much better to be doing it together!  Thanks for the company so far!",

I had the SNB done on both sides a month ago- my right side was fine 2 days after but my left side is still bothering me. That is the side with the mast so that might be the reason. I have an app. with the surgeon today (first check-up after operation one month ago!) and I am hoping to have the axillary node surgery done tomorrow. I'm taking a bag to the hospital so I can be checked right in, if they will do it! They only operate on Wednesdays.  I'm off to the hospital now for app to get path report. I'm very, very, very nervous about what they found in the operation, but there's nothing to do about that. I'll check in with you all tonight if I come home from the hospital. ",

I am having some swelling and irritation under my left armpit (mastectomy side) which makes me a little scared but I'm sure I'm just over reacting- I'm a musician so I REALLY don't want lymphedema. How about you? Are you getting your energy back? newtonville- Good luck on the surgery monday. I'll be thinking of you! As far as losing hair, I also was most worried by the no hair part of chemo. I mean, you can fake the lost boob and if you're not feeling well you can use a little more make-up but losing your hair is impossible to hide! I tried on some wigs and felt like a little old lady.... I tried some chemo hats and felt Quaker.... but I did a bunch of research on the internet and have found some really cool hats and scarves. The most important has been that I have found lots and lots of different ways to tie the scarves so that I don't always have to end up with the Fiddler-on-the-Roof look. Of course, it depends on how much time you want to use figuring everything out, but for me it has been kind of fun and I am looking forward to getting everything I have ordered and trying it out. They say the square scarves that are at least 35\" are best but I've also found that there are lots of ways of tying rectangular scarves also, if they are wide enough to cover the whole head. These are the web sites for head coverings I've liked best:  *** PlanetBuff.com           *****Google Image Result for http://www.therainbowshop.com.au/html/images/products/xtras/headwrap_earth_03.jpg  Hijab - Hijab Al-Muminat: Islamic Clothing for Women  Square Hijab, Islamic Scarf, Buy,Italian Scarves,Mortada,Head Scarf ***Cancer Hats: Guide to choosing the right chemo headwear, cancer turbans, or hats for hairloss during chemotherapy.  Head Scarf - Scarves for Cancer, Chemo, Chemotherapy Patients - Square Scarves  TASARAM - Distinctive Silk Scarves  Exclsuive Prints - Florals  Anokhi USA: All Scarves  Hats with Heart And the most important thing, for me, here are the youtube links on the different ways to tie the scarves:  kangaUSA - How To Tie A Back Twist Turban  kangaUSA - How To Tie A Traditional Head Wrap  YouTube - MY HEAD WRAPS!  YouTube - headwraptutorial  YouTube - Headwrap How to  YouTube - The long head scarf I'll have to see if all the African ways of tying look too ethnic on Norwegian/American me, but I'll probably decide on 3 or 4 main ways of tying and stick with those. I suppose it is my little attempt to make lemonade out of a lemon, but maybe you can find a creative and fun way to show the world that there are lots of ways of being pretty without hair! Hi jennsdogs! ninjamom: You can be our senior advisor, seeing as you have already been through chemo! Thanks! I don't have any questions for you yet, but I'm sure I will later. About the surgery, it really is easier than you fear. But I do think that the worrying before serves the purpose of letting us be relieved afterward. So maybe you could try to  accept the worrying as a natural part of it and not to fight against it.... London-Virginia: I hope the cold cap works on you. It must be hardest to lose long hair - I've had short hair for a long time. Since I am a musician, I will try to get \"cold gloves\" to offset neuropathy. I've heard that you can only cool down one place, but I'll check that when I meet the chemo people. I hope everything goes well with your chemo on Friday. Just remember that you start first, but you will also be done first!  Lots of hugs to everyone, Kari",

My operation (left mast, right lumpectomy, SNB on both sides- clear to begin with) was 3 1/2 weeks ago. My doc has been on vacation, so I finally got another doc to at least tell me if I would have more surgery. Only the path report for the nodes was in and she said they found 5 mm (!) in the left node, growing into the capsule. They found less than 20 tumour cells in the right SN so they will leave that. They want to go back and take all the nodes now.  The news that I have to have more surgery and that I am now in Stage II (hopefully still \"a\", but could tip over to \"b\" with the rest of the path report on Tues) bummed me out almost more than when I first found out that I had BC. How are you feeling? Do you know how much cancer was in the node? It must be horrible to not even to be healed and have to go back for an operation. On the other hand you'll be doing your chemo sooner than me. My chemo won't be able to start before 8 or 9 weeks after my first operation.  I am also very curious about how long the recovery time is. I found the SNB very uncomfortable and wonder if there is a big difference with having all the nodes removed? Also, is it normal for the hospital to not be able to find 5 mm during the sentinal node operation??? Is there something wrong with the pathology department at the hospital or is it just something that happens? I am wondering if 5 mm is alot- does this mean that I almost certainly have other nodes involved? I have tried looking at what is written here, but people don't specify how much cancer is found in each node. I am especially concerned about having problems with my arm after the removal since I am a musician. I would recommend to you, Sunshine, to have contact with a physical therapist that has lymphedemia as a specialty even before the operation. Then you can have someone watching out for you from the beginning to do what you can to avoid LE.  Sunshine, I didn't mean to hijack your thread. We basically are out after the same information after all. If I find anything out I will PM you. If you start chemo in Sept, come over to our \"starting chemo in September 2009\" thread, though I now may have to start an Oct thread..... Take care!",

But I did have a thought- you may want to consider going off the Tykerb some days before you go on vacation and, if you only have a week free, starting up again while on vacation. I remember reading that the half-life of Tykerb is 24 hours and that it takes 6-7 days for full \"saturation\" (or something like that). That says to me that it takes some time for Tykerb to leave and to enter your system.  I just finished my year of Tykerb on December 21 and it took about 2 weeks for the sores in my nose, around my mouth and on my toe to heal up. I have generally not had a big problem with the trots so it is hard for me to judge when how quickly that would clear up for you. But it took about a week to go from my Tykerb \"norm\" (never knowing what to expect from a bathroom visit) to the regular of the non-Tykerb world. Maybe someone else will chime in on how quickly the Tykerb trots disappear? Also be careful about how much you are in the sun. I got a horrible case of an allergic reaction to the sun (my conclusion- the onc never quite figured out what it was but I've later heard that one gets sun-sensitive on Tykerb). I got oozing pimple-like things all over my arms, back, chest and face. About 80 of them. Ick! After it started it was very uncomfortable for me to be in the sun or to get too warm. And it itched like crazy! I bought some colorful, thin long-armed cotton kaftans and that made it easier for me to be outside. It all cleared up when I came back to Norway. I hope you get the A-OK for a Tykerb break and I wish you a fabulous vacation with all sorts of umbrella drinks! Sounds like SO much fun!",

I've never heard of anyone taking more than 1500 mg a day, and that might just be for Tykerb alone. Lisa- Fingernails are getting better. I guess I need to grow the whole fingernail without Tykerb in the system before they are really back to normal. But I now can peel an orange! I noticed that I had no cuticles at all on Tykerb. Same for you? They are on the way back, too. ",

Then I tried some \"chemo scarfs\" (pre-tied) and they made me feel really \"old lady-ish\" and they were expensive. I'm only 48 and still try to be a little hip (O.K., I'm sure I don't manage it, but at least  I'm trying!)  so  I was really upset about having to look dumpy for 7 months. I feel dumpy enough as it is having to be a patient and having one breast lopped off! I mean, after 40, my best body parts have been my breasts and hair! Anyway, after seeing some of these web sites and YouTube tutorials I am now excited about trying out all the styles. Since most of the styles are african, some of them might look a little too ethnic on american-norwegian me, but they are really easy to do and certainly don't look too \"fiddler on the roof\"! Anyway, I just wanted to share my research! I am living in Oslo too so feel free to PM me about anything. I was done with chemo and rads last May and I am feeling great now. Fretex is a good place to find cheap scarves. Good luck!",

But I do think there may be more of a tradition to trust your doctor more in Norway and not to ask too many questions- after all he/she is the expert. Just a theori I have....

There are ice mitts and booties, made precisely for chemo patients (I think....) or as Kerry suggests, use ice packs or ice in Ziplock bags. My chemo nurse said they used to use ice water. With the ice mitts, they start me off 15 minutes before I get the Taxol so that I am good and numb when it starts. They change the ice mitts any time I feel like I'm getting warm again- about every 30 minutes. Then I continue with the mitts for 15 minutes after the Taxol is done. If they don't already use ice mitts where you are, you could check if they have a freezer you could use and if they would mind going and fetching new supplies for you when things start melting.

Not fun but doable. Every part of the journey was much scarier than it ended up being in reality. We are lots of women on these boards that have been exactly where you are now and we will help you through the next months. Jeanwash- Houndmommy is right, there is no need to rush into things.Alot of women with larger tumors have chemo before the operation to be able to see which chemo is working and (most importantly, I believe) to shrink the tumor in order to get clean margins in the surgery. I did have a Mx only a week after my diagnosis and it all worked out (clean margins) but in hindsight I should have done more research and asked more questions before rushing ahead. A week or 2 or 3 will not make any difference in the result- the tumor gets blasted away by chemo and cut out anyway. Also, in many (most?) cases, it is not neccessary to have a bi-lateral Mx- the survival statistics are usually not higher. I am stage III and we are more worried about spreading than a local occurrance. Everyone's cancer is different and there are many individual factors that affect which treatment is best for you.  Good luck on the way forward. You WILL get through this! Hugs",

I asked my onc about this and he said that they don't give the Neulasta until they see that you need it and that it has its own set of SE's and risks. It turned out that I needed it for the third infusion so then got it automatically for the fourth infusion as well. I have to say that I don't know how Doxil compares to FEC100 as to percentage of people needing the Neulasta, but I would certainly hope that it wasn't just a question of money that your mother didn't get the shot.

It is true that the terms are used differently by different people and I don't really know what is \"right\". If you are concerned about if it is curable, it can absolutely be beaten.

They are always soaking body parts in it and swear that it works. I will try tonight.  Keep in touch if you find something that works.

I have gotten splits on my heels and they are surprisingly painful. I was recommended a rubber-like \"guard\" or \"bandaid\" thing that sticks on and covers your whole heel. I wish I could describe it better but it is made by Compeed (maybe only available in Europe?). Anyway, it certainly worked a charm! Every once in awhile, I feel queasy in the stomach for a day. I am told that that is also from the Tykerb. Anyone else have that?  Lisa- are you gluing the layers of your nails together or what? I got a Mavala nail kit from the chemo people and the nail hardener works really well to stick the different layers of the nail tips together. I'm thinking superglue might have the same effect...

The reason I was given by my onc that I got FEC, is that the \"E\" in FEC is less damaging to the heart than the \"A\" in AC. But FEC is more expensive than AC, so maybe the insurance companies don't think it is worth paying for in the USA? Like many of these international differences, there are usually two different arguments as to which is best and there is no \"right\" answer. It was quite disconcerting to me at the beginning to see that treatment the Americans were getting differed sometimes from what the Europeans (and usually Canadians) got. But everytime I asked my onc about it, his explanations made alot of sense to me and I think we are getting just as good care as anyone else.",

But I'm really glad you are following up on the left side. I would like that they can feel the lump that you feel and can tell you why the dimpling and lump are there. The odds are definitely very good for you that it is not cancer, but especially with your family history, I think it is really worth it to take all the tests you can.  It caught my eye that you said it felt like a \"small, thick pencil eraser type lump\". I don't know if you mean the eraser type that is on top of a pencil or the type that is rectangular, flat and separate from the pencil, but my lump felt like the rectangular, flat type of eraser. It was more of a thickening and not at all the way I expected a lump to feel. It was at the back of my breast lying flat against the chest wall. In the end I could feel it, but not all the doctors could feel it without me really directing them.  It turns out that I had IDC but with \"lobular growth pattern\". ILC is not so common but, as I understand it, very sneaky and can be hard to detect on different tests and often hard to feel. I might suggest you have a look at some of the ILC threads to at least be able rule out having ILC.  I feel bad being so suspicous whenever I hear of someone with symptoms that are like mine were. But knowledge is power and early detection makes such a big difference in the odds of beating this!  Good luck and remember 80% of lumps turn out to be B9!!",

For me, the diarrhea didn't get going until the 3rd week. By the 4th week, I was having a very bad time- cramps and very watery stools 20 times a day :-( I took more than the max of Immodium (trial nurse said to try to stay ahead of it....) but it didn't make a dent. I do wonder if I got a tummy bug that week and that it wasn't only the Tykerb. Anyway, just then the trial protocoll changed to 750 mg whilst on Taxol (not a moment too soon for me) and within a week the diarrhea settled down to once every few days. Now I am done with Taxol and am up to 1500 mg again. I have almost NO SE's!!!! My trial nurse says that often the first month is the hardest and then things get better. She recommends taking 2 Immodium at the same time as the Tykerb to help ward off the diarrhea. She also has said that there is no danger in taking lots of Immodium since it works locally (doesn't give you constipation) and to take one every time you have a runny bathroom visit, to try to stay ahead of things. I take the Tykerb at night, because it is easier for me to remember not to eat for an hour before I go to bed than after I get up in the morning. They are huge pills but they go down easily. I recently signed some new papers for the ALTTO trial and saw that they now allow you to dissolve them in water (in a specified way, with a specified amount of water) as well.  Will you be taking the Tykerb alone or with Xeloda or Herceptin? Since I started out with it at the same time as Taxol, it is hard to know how much my hard start is due to the combination. But things have really settled down and my only problems these days are that I get split finger tips, crusty nose gunk and an occaisional swelling next to a nail. Not exactly big problems :-) Here's hoping for an easy start with Tykerb and that it crushes the mets to the curb! ",
