The doctor could determine surgery doesn't make sense, so I don't want to get too wound up about it.  But....presuming I do have this surgery, what should I expect in the way of recovery? I live alone (four flights up). My preference would be to stay at my home, and ask family members to stay with me for a couple days. Not sure if this is practical. I would probably stay with my sis otherwise. What was your experience like? (Of course I will ask the dr. about this, but I wanted to ask those who have been thru it.) I'd appreciate hearing from anyone who had surgery, regardless of stage.   I did look around at some other threads, but didn't see what I was looking for.

      "Content": "EnglishMajor wrote: Hey ladies I had my surgery almost two weeks ago and expect to be back to work in a couple weeks. I don't know why I am letting work crap get to me when I am not there... I guess it's a habit I can't drop! Anyhow, I have one direct report at work. I am thinking she must have a mile wide passive agressive streak...among other things. I was first diagnosed last fall and frankly not too concerned about work then--I spent two weeks having tests, etc., etc. Before I learned I was Stage IV, I was penciled in for surgery. (Good thing they used pencil, cause I only just had it!)  Eventually, I was sent back to work (no surgery, no chemo, just Tamoxifen). My colleague treated me as tho I were not there. It wasn't an attempt to be rude, I just think she felt on eggshells with me. (And I know, if you haven't been around someone with cancer there could be a tendency to think \"Well, no point in bringing her up to speed, she's gonna be out puking with chemo or maybe dying in a few months.\") It didn't help when, as I started to explain I would be taking Tamoxifen (until it no longer works) she jumped ahead of me and said \"And that's it [you'll be fine after that].\" I then had to explain, nope, not exactly....We did have some miscommunications. I did take out some of my anger/emotional chaos out on her, for which I later apologized.   My collegue was out of the office for some weeks prior to me departing for  my surgery. I really felt she went out of her way not to offer good wishes before leaving (no card, no email, etc.) I had to talk to her the day before the surgery and she kind of went thru the motions of wishing me well. Others (whom I don't work directly with) sent flowers and a care package (she did sign the group card).  Fast forward to last week when an outside vendor forwards an email to me in which she is giving him a little grief for being behind and then says \"But no one could be as late as English Major.\" WTF??? First off,  I took the time to get six weeks ahead prior to my leave. Gee, glad I could make that happen. Second, I am not chronically behind--I may have my weeks, but its been so dead in our industry, frankly not a problem lately. But more to the point, beyond the truth of the matter, where does she get off throwing me under the bus? Was that necessary?  I responded to both people saying I was ahead. To me, this would have been a good time for her to apologize, wish me well, etc. But noooooooo.... She responds back to me and the vendor sayding well this is an exception, this month cause I am out. So I wrote back to her privately and said if she had an issue with my work being timely I'd appreciate her taking up with me directly and I didn't feel it was necessary to involve me in the correspondence with the vendor, tho I am sure she was just trying to make little joke. Still following me?? She then responds to the effect that yes, it was wrong for the vendor to forward  the email (clearly not what I said at all) and, not that she's going to pull records, but if she did my work would shown to have been late. (Gee, passive aggressive much?) Then she put in some half assed enjoy the weather comment. I thanked her for apology and kind wishes. Sheesh!  What would you do? There's no point in dragging our boss in this, he has bigger fish to fry. I was thinking of cooling off for a day or so and then just calling her and trying to have a calm conversation to reiterate that commenting on my work performance is inappropriate and certainly unprofessional and besides that, untrue.  (Nodoubt she will continue to blame the forwarder and maintain that anyhow my work isn't timely.) I stand by my point:She shouldn't have mentioned me at all--it was neither funny nor true and think it is SHE who owes me an apology. Second, I  feel compelled to ask why she basically is blowing me off--it's not hard for ME to talk about having cancer but I think it makes HER uncomfortable. Again, I antcipate she will cloak her nonsupport in terms of \"I didn't want to bother you.\"  Dx 7/6/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "EnglishMajor wrote: Bill Keller\u2019s NYT op-ed piece on \u201cHeroic Measures\u201d (January 12, 2014)  misrepresents what metastatic breast cancer is and how it is treated. Keller is writing about Lisa Bonchek Adams--a 40-something woman with MBC who tweets and blogs her experiences with the disease (as well as humorous tidbits about her kids, dog, etc.).   While it is true that Adams was diagnosed with early stage cancer seven years ago, she has not been in a seven-year \u201cpublic cage fight with death,\u201d as Keller writes. Keller's editorial suggests that Adams is somehow pulling out all the stops with her metastatic breast cancer treatment. This isn't true--Adams is getting standard of care--the same as any of us would get. She did enroll in a clinical trial (and washed out of it) but it was NOT the last-ditch effort Keller paints it as--she still has some arrows left in quiver. When Adams was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) a little over a year ago, it was then that her cancer became incurable\u2013but still treatable\u2014for now. For now, Adams is LIVING with metastatic breast cancer, as are 150,000 other US people. As Adams correctly told Keller, the course of the disease can involve many periods of relative stability, interspersed with serious complications and side effects. To live with MBC is to embrace uncertainty\u2014you don\u2019t know if a drug will work, how long it will work and how you will tolerate it. You just take it one day at a time. There is no wrong or right way to live with metastatic breast cancer\u2013there is only the way that works best for YOU. As someone with MBC, Keller's ignorance of the MBC facts of life are frustrating. I hope this video will set people like him straight: http://animoto.com/play/pp9bg5hNO4Y1l5WJAfVcWA ....and here's a blog I contrbuted to on this topic: http://mbcnbuzz.wordpress.com/2014/01/13/bill-kellers-misguided-nyt-oped-piece-mbcn-responds/ Dx 7/6/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Maybe N.E.D. will inspire doctors in other specialties to follow suit. For example those specializing in male cancers could start a supergroup: \"Turn Your Head and Cough.\" Here is some info from the web site: N.E.D. (No Evidence of Disease) is an extraordinary new band, consisting entirely of musically talented gynecologic cancer surgeons, who have come together to play a mix of original alternative rock and folk-rock songs with the goal of raising awareness about women's cancer issues. The band has teamed up with Motéma to record and promote a CD for release in September, 2009, to coincide with Gynecologic Cancer Awareness Month, and to help publicize the first annual Gynecologic Cancer Awareness Day and Race which takes place on November 8th, 2009 in Washington, D.C. Watch this great Newscast US Video to learn about the band and hear their music! Help us spread the message, raise money and save lives by sharing the N.E.D. widget on your blog, myspace or facebook page. 65% of proceeds from sale of the CD's ($10 at this site) go to the Gynecologic Cancer Foundations's N.E.D. fund. You can also recieve the CD as a gift premium for any donation of $50 or more to the N.E.D. Fund of The GCF. For a $100 donation you will also recieve a copy of the N.E.D. companion book Music & Cancer: A Prescription For Healing by Dr. N. Nagarsheth. For a $500 donation receive also a handsome N.E.D.

      "Content": "EnglishMajor wrote: The bar is pretty low when it comes to people finding new ways to make money on \"breast cancer awareness\" but this one is amazing in its audacity..... Here are some hightlights: http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/16581681-418/boobies-rock-t-shirt-company-cashes-in-on-cancer.html You see them at bars and Bears games and other places around Chicago and the suburbs that attract big crowds and a lot of men \u2014 young women who want you to help a \u201cgood cause\u201d by buying T-shirts and other items emblazoned with the words \u201cBoobies Rock!\u201d and similarly provocative phrases. Their pitch: \u201cWould you like to make a donation to breast-cancer awareness?\u201d Former sellers say it works, often bringing in $3,000 or more in cash at events for Boobies Rock, a company based in a Denver suburb. Often, they say, people would press money into their hands saying they want to donate to the fight against breast cancer, even if they don\u2019t want a T-shirt, beer koozie or bracelet. \u201cWe had these bags of cash,\u201d says Berlinda Williams, who collected money from tailgaters at the Oct. 20 Notre Dame football game. Williams says her boss told her to \u201cjust tell them this is going toward a good cause.\u201d But Boobies Rock isn\u2019t a charity. It\u2019s a for-profit business. And some of the charities it claims to help say these claims are misleading, a Chicago Sun-Times investigation has found. A marketing presentation obtained by the Sun-Times that Boobies Rock uses to gain entry to some venues put its gross revenues for 2011 at about $1.1 million, with net revenue of $400,000 and unspecified \u201ctotal commitments\u201d at just over $250,000. ....a $250,000 legal settlement that Boobies Rock founder Adam Shryock paid to the Keep-A-Breast Foundation, best known for its I (Heart) Boobies products, to settle a trademark-infringement suit. Shryock confirms that the \u201ccommitments\u201d included the settlement. In addition to the money, Shryock and The Se7ven Group, another business he owns, gave up about $200,000 in merchandise to settle the Keep-A-Breast Foundation lawsuit, according to Gary Sirota, an attorney for the California charity. Sirota says that in preparing his organization\u2019s lawsuit, he spoke with about a dozen women who sold Boobies Rock merchandise. He says one woman, in Memphis, Tenn., told him her three-person team collected about $20,000 in cash in three months. \u201cThe guy gave up $450,000 of cash and merchandise without blinking an eye,\u201d Sirota says of the Shryock settlement. \u201cThat tells me something.\u201d Jessica Thompson, who answered a Craigslist ad seeking promotional models, sold T-shirts and other Boobies Rock items at the Oct. 20 Notre Dame game and at the Oct. 22 Bears game. She says her trainer told her to roam the parking lots with Boobies Rock merchandise, seeking \u201cdonations.\u201d \u201cShe explicitly told us it was not selling and to not use the word \u2018sell,\u2019 \u201d Thompson says. Instead, she says she was told, \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018breast-cancer awareness promotion.\u2019 \u201c Thompson says people were told that if they donated a certain amount, they would receive a \u201cprize\u201d like a T-shirt or bracelet. \u201cI was assuming it was a charity,\u201d she says. Thompson says she saw her trainer bag up the cash \u2014 about $3,000 for each game. She says the trainer boasted of collecting $4,000 some weekends. Thompson says she was unnerved by a comment the trainer made as she spoke of her plans to carry the cash back to Boobies Rock in Colorado: \u201cShe said, \u2018I always feel like a drug dealer when I fly back to Denver.\u2019 \u201c Williams says she, too, was surprised to learn that she wasn\u2019t working for a nonprofit organization. \u201cMy mom died of cancer,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought I was doing a good cause.\u201d   ...Shryock says that as a for-profit business, Boobies Rock doesn\u2019t have to give any money to charity. But he says it does so, sometimes \u201canonymously\u201d or under a name other than Boobies Rock, such as The Se7ven Group. He says that\u2019s why some of the charities\u2019 figures are lower than his. And he said he gave $3,000 to an individual breast cancer sufferer. He says he can\u2019t control the actions of independent sellers who exaggerate the charitable aspect of the business. \u201cThe girls are instructed very matter-of-factly what we are and what we are not,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cannot control what some of these girls say.\u201d He acknowledges that one seller told people she herself had cancer. He says another claimed that 80 percent of the money raised by Boobies Rock goes to charity. When things like this happen, Shryock says, \u201cWe put a stop to it.\u201d Dx 7/6/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Source Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center Department of Pathology, University of Miami, Miami, Florida. Abstract \u2002 We report a case of a 93-year-old woman who was diagnosed with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, T2N0M0 (stage I) breast cancer (BC) at the age of 45. Twenty-two years later, she was diagnosed with metastatic lesions to the lungs consistent with the breast primary. Her disease was stable on tamoxifen, anastrozole, and exemestane for 14\u2003years. Subsequently, she was found to have metastatic lesions to thoracic spine as well as progressively increasing bilateral pleural effusions. At that time, she was deemed not to be a good candidate for chemotherapy and therapy was changed to fulvestrant. Two years later (38\u2003years after initial diagnosis of BC), she was diagnosed with new metastatic liver lesions; although her pulmonary and bone metastases remained stable. Therefore, she was started on palliative chemotherapy with single-agent capecitabine. The treatment was discontinued after the second cycle upon the patient's request owing to grade 2 hand and foot syndrome. She expired 2\u2003years later after fighting BC for four decades. She survived for 18\u2003years after the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) while maintaining a good quality of life. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case in the literature with the longest overall survival in a patient with MBC. We provide a detailed clinical analysis in conjunction with a brief literature review. Dx 7/6/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Upon turning 50 [not 90 as some emails have it]  in 2006, Cleaveland Plain Dealer columnist Regina Brett wrote 50 lessons that life has taught her:  1. Life isn't fair, but it's still good. 2. When in doubt, just take the next small step. 3. Life is too short to waste time hating anyone. 4. Don't take yourself so seriously. No one else does. 5. Pay off your credit cards every month. 6. You don't have to win every argument. Agree to disagree. 7. Cry with someone. It's more healing than crying alone. 8. It's OK to get angry with God. He can take it. 9. Save for retirement starting with your first paycheck. 10. When it comes to chocolate, resistance is futile. 11. Make peace with your past so it won't screw up the present. 12. It's OK to let your children see you cry. 13. Don't compare your life to others'. You have no idea what their journey is all about. 14. If a relationship has to be a secret, you shouldn't be in it. 15. Everything can change in the blink of an eye. But don't worry; God never blinks. 16. Life is too short for long pity parties. Get busy living, or get busy dying. 17. You can get through anything if you stay put in today. 18. A writer writes. If you want to be a writer, write. 19. It's never too late to have a happy childhood. But the second one is up to you and no one else. 20. When it comes to going after what you love in life, don't take no for an answer. 21. Burn the candles, use the nice sheets, wear the fancy lingerie. Don't save it for a special occasion. Today is special. 22. Overprepare, then go with the flow. 23. Be eccentric now. Don't wait for old age to wear purple. 24. The most important sex organ is the brain. 25. No one is in charge of your happiness except you. 26. Frame every so-called disaster with these words: \"In five years, will this matter?\" 27. Always choose life. 28. Forgive everyone everything. 29. What other people think of you is none of your business. 30. Time heals almost everything. Give time time. 31. However good or bad a situation is, it will change. 32. Your job won't take care of you when you are sick. Your friends will. Stay in touch. 33. Believe in miracles. 34. God loves you because of who God is, not because of anything you did or didn't do. 35. Whatever doesn't kill you really does make you stronger. 36. Growing old beats the alternative - dying young. 37. Your children get only one childhood. Make it memorable. 38. Read the Psalms. They cover every human emotion. 39. Get outside every day. Miracles are waiting everywhere. 40. If we all threw our problems in a pile and saw everyone else's, we'd grab ours back. 41. Don't audit life. Show up and make the most of it now. 42. Get rid of anything that isn't useful, beautiful or joyful. 43. All that truly matters in the end is that you loved. 44. Envy is a waste of time. You already have all you need. 45. The best is yet to come. 46. No matter how you feel, get up, dress up and show up. 47. Take a deep breath. It calms the mind. 48. If you don't ask, you don't get. 49. Yield. 50.

I'm relieved it's over with and glad that I succeeded in some small way of creating more awareness for metastatic breast cancer. I will start earlier next year and build on what I've learned.  But I've also decided to create my own holiday: Breast Cancer Remembrance Day. On Oct, 31, the final day of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I will remember the friends and family I have lost to this disease. It's Sunday, so I will light a candle for them and say some prayers.  I will wear black, not for its funeral implications but for its simple dignity, a quality that has been sadly lacking these past 30 pink saturated days.   At 8:45 pm that night I will go outside with a flashlight. I'll think of the one in 8* U.S. women who will get breast cancer and the 45,000 who will die this year. My eighth grade science teacher told us  if you turned on a flashlight and pointed it toward the sky the photons leave the flashlight and they immediately start to spread out. Provided that they don't hit anything, each individual photon travels through space forever.  Time slows down as you approach the speed of light. I'll think of those whose time was all too brief and I'll hope for brighter days ahead.   *ETA to add that \"1 in 8\" should be put in proper context. As the National Cancer Institute explains: Women born now have an average risk of 12.2 percent (often expressed as \"1 in 8\") of being diagnosed with breast cancer at some time in their lives. On the other hand, the chance that they will never have breast cancer is 87.8 percent (expressed as \"7 in 8\"). But that is a lifetime risk. Risk increases with age, so the NCI provides a more helpful way of looking at it - for all of those women watching who are of different ages: A woman's chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer is: from age 30 through age 39 . . . . . . 0.43 percent (often expressed as \"1 in 233\") from age 40 through age 49 . . . . . . 1.45 percent (often expressed as \"1 in 69\") from age 50 through age 59 . . . . . . 2.38 percent (often expressed as \"1 in 42\") from age 60 through age 69 . . . . . . 3.45 percent (often expressed as \"1 in 29\") Dx 7/6/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "EnglishMajor wrote: I like my doctor, but  I don't feel the insitution at large has been proactive in offering neccessary advice in non medical matters. I am glad that my overall health continues to be good. Because I started as Stage IV out of the gate I had no prior cancer experience. Someone wilth early stage breast cancer would get an orientation day at this hospital. They would spend the first part of the day meeting with the various doctors involved in their care. Lunch is brought in (crappy I'm sure) and then, if they are having chemo there is instruction. So they would know all the hospital protocol and where everything is.... My experience: I knew nothing. After my first appointment with the oncologist, the person at the desk told me to come an hour earlier for blood work the next time. That was it. About a year after my dx I had surgery. I had to refer myself to the Image Center to get a post mx camisole. I was then give a crappy photocopied binder--the orientation materials I should have gotten a year ago as a new patient. Although my bloodwork has been consistently good (because I haven't had chemo and have been in good health) my doctor tends to write orders for xgeva on the day of my appointment. The past two appointments she forgot and I had to wait about 45 minutes until she finished seeing another patient and the nurse could get an order. Today, what should have been a 10-minute nurse visit was about an hour and 20 minutes. Last time I saw the doctor as per usual. I waited and waited for the nurse to come give me a short as usual. After 20 minutes I went out and asked someone--the nurse told me the dr. didn't sign the order--so again, I had to wait til she finished seeing another patient. I certainly understand a medical office will experience delays, but I don't think there was any reason this couldn't have been avoided... Given I have no other health problems, I don't now why these orders couldn't have been written months ahead. (Today I think the nurse got the doctor to do that...) I have been offered the service of the center's psychological counselor. However, at no time did anyone tell me anything about the hospital's social workers and what they might do for me. I presumed I wouldn't see a social worker unless I was going to hospice or had no insurance. I've since learned, tho, that the social workers would be the ones to (hopefully) let me know about any drug company finacial aid I would elgible for. Because I am insured and work full time, I presumed I wasn't eligible for any aid--but that is NOT the case--I believe I am elgible for some co pay assistance. When my job changed, my income was halved. I'm not destitute by any means, but I hope to be here a long time. So yes, I want help. Altho I genuinely like all of the hospital personnel, I feel no one is truly looking out for my non medical needs and if I didn't say anything nothing would change. I think that as a \"chronic\" patient there should be periodic reviews of my case and my personal situation so that I could get the best care at the best price. I do feel like the system is not all set up to deal with someone like me. I had a long talk with the oncologist's nurse today. I don't know if it will do any good. I will follow up when I next see the dr.  Just curious what you have experienced..... Dx 7/6/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "EnglishMajor wrote:  I thought this was a great article. (Although I don't think people should talk about themselves in the third person plural. (\"How do we feel about our treatment?\") Would you say \"We feel constipated today?\" But that's a minor quibble. I liked the alternative response suggestions.  From www.Caring.com (thanks to Deanie for posting on another board) WHAT NOT TO SAY TO SOMEONE WITH CANCER Melanie Haiken, Caring.com senior editor Experts caution that when caring for someone with cancer, there are six things friends or family often say-in an attempt to be sympathetic, supportive, or encouraging - that can have just the opposite consequence: shutting down communication and making the person with cancer feel worse. Psychiatrist Jeffrey Knajdl, director of psycho-oncology services at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, points to these six common sayings to avoid, along with suggestions for what to say instead: 1. \"Everything is going to be all right.\" You have no way of knowing if it will be or not, says Knajdl, and such a statement ends up sounding like an empty platitude - plus you establish a sense of mistrust. \"It doesn't make the person feel better,\" says Knajdl, \"because he knows it's not true and it just makes him feel dismissed and not heard.\" What to say instead: What the person really wants to hear is that you're going to be there for him through the good times and the bad, and that he's not going to go through cancer treatment alone. There will be days when it does feel like everything's going to be all right, and you'll be there to celebrate that with him, but there will be days when discouraging test results come in or he's in pain - and you'll be there for that, too. \"When you talk to patients, their two big fears are that they won't make it through treatment, and that they'll be alone and in pain,\" says Knajdl. \"Just keep telling the person that you'll be there with him and you'll make it through this together.\" 2. \"I know how you feel.\" This is almost an automatic response for many of us when someone is sad or upset. We say it out of the best of intentions, to demonstrate our compassion, our sympathy, our sense of having been there. The problem is, it has the unintended effect of shutting the other person down, says Knajdl. \"When you say, \u2018I know how you feel,' the unspoken second part of the thought is, \u2018and therefore you don't have to go into any detail about it,'\" Knajdl says. \"It increases the patient's sense of isolation, because it's like telling him you don't want him to talk about it.\" Unless you've been treated for the same type of cancer and have undergone exactly the same treatment, you really don't know how the person feels. \"We have no idea what it's like, and it's upsetting to the patient when we act like we do,\" says Knajdl. What to say instead: A better approach, according to Knajdl, is to ask something like, \"How are your mood and spirits holding up through this?\" If the person you're concerned about is anxious or sad, this gives him a chance to tell you how he feels, which can be a big relief to someone who's trying to pretend he's doing just fine. And even if he answers that he's holding up pretty well, he'll still feel better that you asked. 3. \"Try to keep a positive attitude, relax, and avoid stress. It can help you heal.\" Cancer patients hear endless variations on this \"mind over body\" theme. There are going to be days when a patient doesn't feel positive at all, and you certainly don't want him worrying that he's sabotaging his own chances of recovery. And what if he has a stressful job, or is a type A personality who reacts easily to stress - do you want him feeling guilty or worrying that his high-strung personality or tendency toward anxiety either \"caused\" or will worsen his cancer? Unfortunately, an awful lot of the literature conveys, in one way or another, the underlying message to cancer patients that they may have \"caused\" cancer through stress, worry, or a negative attitude, and that they could heal the cancer if they'd only develop a mellow outlook or sunny disposition. All that really happens is that they feel even more anxious about trying not to be anxious, or they feel guilty for not feeling happy. Even some visualization techniques can make cancer patients feel a sense of defeat, Knajdl says, if the focus is on healing but healing doesn't seem to be happening. What to say instead: Suggest specific solutions. When your loved one is tense or anxious, ask him to identify what's stressing him out and how you can help him put the worries to rest. In other words, instead of saying \"relax,\" help him relax by eradicating the stress trigger. For example, try refocusing any visualization he's doing toward a concrete and reasonably accessible goal, such as comfort or sleep. Instead of trying to visualize eradicating a tumor, suggest that he visualize falling into a deep sleep in a quiet, safe, pleasant place. Sometimes you can help eradicate stress with a concrete act of assistance. Knajdl remembers one patient who was very anxious in the hospital because he felt he hadn't put his financial house in order. His son brought all the documents to the hospital, and they took care of them one by one. 4. \"We can beat this.\" In our rush to be supportive, it's all too easy to fall back on such encouraging and inspirational messages. But they can give cancer patients a deep-seated feeling of failure. \"I call this the Lance Armstrong syndrome, this idea that if you have the right fighting spirit you can overcome disease,\" says Knajdl. \"I admire Armstrong and he's done great things to publicize cancer, but this idea that people can triumph over cancer with will power and an upbeat attitude is just crazy. There are all sorts of factors that contribute to why some people recover and some don't. The truth is, some people just get lucky.\" This problem tends to come up with cancer survivors in particular, who may believe very deeply that their attitude, philosophy, spiritual focus, or belief in healing helped them survive. And sometimes hearing such stories can make other patients feel hopeful and optimistic. But if things aren't going well - if a scary test result has just come in, if chemo's side effects are almost unbearable, if your loved one is facing the fact that his cancer may not be curable - then hearing others' tales of triumph may not be helpful. What to say instead: The best way to help your loved one feel positive and hopeful is to just keep reassuring him that you're in this together, and that you'll keep caring for him and supporting him and making him as comfortable as possible during his treatment. 5. \"Now, now, don't get yourself all worked up.\" Your loved one is scared, angry, or in tears, and you want him to feel better. But unfortunately, a statement like this makes it sound as if you want him to put his feelings, which are natural and unavoidable, under wraps. \"In this situation, it's okay to get worked up, and it's okay to vent,\" says Knajdl. \"We have this fear of feelings getting out of control. But sometimes a patient needs opportunities to cry or get angry or get upset, and if you can help him express these feelings and get them out, in the end he'll feel better.\" What to say instead: If you don't know what to say, it's okay not to say anything at all, Knajdl says. Just offer the comfort of your presence, a hug, or an arm around the shoulders. Allowing some silence without rushing to fill it gives the person a chance to say what's on his mind in his own time. Perhaps he's afraid of pain, afraid of letting you down, or frustrated by feeling incapacitated by his illness. \"One patient surprised his son by saying, \u2018I feel frustrated lying here in the hospital because I feel like I'm wasting my time,'\" Knajdl says. \"It turned out he was actually upset that he didn't have his legal affairs in order. The son responded by saying, \u2018Would you like me to get a lawyer to come in so we can take care of that?' That made his father feel much better.\" 6. \"Congratulations, you're done with chemo [or radiation].\" As a friend or family member, you'll feel thrilled when treatment is finished, but the patient's feelings are likely to be much more mixed. During treatment, he's taking action. That can be empowering because the focus is on a solution, either a cure or progress in pushing back the cancer. When treatment is finished, it can feel like there's nothing more for him to do but wait, and naturally he may feel anxious and uncertain. \"Often, people don't feel like celebrating. Instead they think, \u2018Now what do I do? Just wait for the cancer to come back?'\" says Knajdl. No matter how relieved you are, try to keep it to yourself. \"It's really common to say something like, \u2018Boy, am I glad that's over,' but that implies two things: that the treatment has been a burden on you, and that you want your loved one to be happy about it when maybe he's not feeling happy,\" Knajdl says. What to say instead: Give the person a chance to express how he's feeling. Try asking an open-ended question, such as, \"How are you feeling now that we're finishing up the chemo?\" This way, you allow him to control the response. He might say, \"I know we were talking about throwing a party when I finished chemo, but I really don't feel like it.\" The bottom line is, whatever he's feeling is okay, and your job is to make it clear you're ready to listen.

I knew that they were sponsor of the MBC Network conference I just attended in Indy, for which I was grateful. When I was first dx'd, I did ask my dr. if they were \"helping the cause\" and she said yes. I found Kathy Latour's blog  at www.curetoday.com  most  insightful. I think because Komen has been out there  the longest, they are probably lumped in (so to speak) with some others that  have misappropriated the  ribbon for  their own purposes.    LaTour writes:  The 127 races that are held by Komen affiliates around the world raise a lot of money--yes. And 75 percent of those funds stay in the community where they were raised to be used on all kinds of breast cancer related needs. Each affiliate sets its own guidelines, but they award grants in their area to non-profits, including hospitals, that provide such services as screening, diagnostics, and treatment as well as programs to educate and raise awareness. Some fund services such as expenses for survivors like transportation to treatment. In the '90s I was founding president of the board of two nonprofits in Dallas that addressed breast cancer. The first, a group called the Bridge Breast Network, assists uninsured women with diagnosis and treatment. We started the group with funding from memorials for my mother, who died of breast cancer in 1992, and then we had the very arduous task of fund raising for a start up that provided medical care for women with breast cancer. Had it not been for the Dallas Affiliate of Komen, we would never have gotten off the ground. And the women we served--all of whom did not have insurance and many of whom were minority--would not have had treatment. When we started Gilda's Club North Texas, the funding also came, albeit at lower amounts because we had to prove the numbers of our members that were breast cancer survivors. Komen affiliates do their homework on every grant. The other 25 percent of the money raised by the Komen affiliates goes back to Komen National and is directed to research \u2013 all of it. So where does the money come from to run the organization: corporate sponsors. The speaker always told the class how each partner was vetted and contracted so that both sides got what they wanted from the deal. In case you think they only said no to a few, I called Komen for the latest figures. In 2009 they had 366 companies approach them wanting to partner. They accepted 76. And remember that each of those companies that was turned down was offering money See entire post here:   www.curetoday.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/blog.showIndex/kathylatour/2010/10/2 7/Komen-for-the-Cure--Breast-Cancer-Action  Dx 7/6/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

(I remember Googling and the BC.org section on mets came up: \"We know you really don't want to be here reading about metatstatic breast cancer...\" True!) I have been fortunate to be pretty much stable on Tamoxifen for 2 years after presenting with a small volume of bone mets. But enough about me, how about you?   Dx 7/6/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "EnglishMajor wrote: Hi ladies I haven't had many side effects with the tamoxifen/zometa/zoladex regimen. With zometa, I do feel some aches and pains (sometimes very tight calf muscles the next day) but it doesn't last. Now having been on this for coming up on six months, I notice my hands are a little stiff at times and the bottom of my feet are sometimes sore. It's not terrible, but the hand stiffness bothers me in that it is new and it seems to be sticking around, unlike the other temporary reactions.. My doctor suggests this could be arthritis. (I am 44 and never had any arthritic symptoms before.) (I am not on AI's, where apparently this can be a side effect.) Consulting Dr. Google, I see some people given zoladex (lupron) for other ailments (endometrosis, etc) have mentioned arthrtitis. Just curious if anyone else  has had hand pain/stiffness with lupron injections. Dx 7/6/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
