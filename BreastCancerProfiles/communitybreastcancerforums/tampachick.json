Bring something to zip up, nothing over the head. For home, more comfy pants and larger zip up tops, hoodies. I was able to move my arms fine after to eat, drink. I clip my drains to the bra, no problems. Great sports bra is the Natori brand. I am 5 days out from the 1 step and doing well. Vicodin helped better then the morphine drip for me. Good luck and big Hugs! Steph ",

I tested positive for BRCA1 in July and now I am thinking about a bilat after all that. Where do I start? I need to get a breast surgeon and PS, correct? I am in Tampa and looking for recommendations. I'd go to Boston, NY or south florida too. I'd love to keep the nipples but I highly doubt that will happen. Do you guys have pics of yours you would share? How long did it take you to find a doc and then schedule surgery? Thanks!
