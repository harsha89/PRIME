I was nursing my 18 month old daughter at the time I was diagnosed, so there was only a month between when I weaned her cold turkey and went in for surgery. When I went in for my consultation with my plastic surgeon, he declined to perform the immediate reconstruction because he was concerned about the risk of  infection from residual breast milk that would create an unsterile environment.  I was devastated and couldn't keep myself from breaking down and crying in the doctors office.  Although it's been hard to have my reconstruction put off. The bra with prosthetic inserts aren't as bad as I expected. A friend of mine who had to have one of her TE removed because of infection also wore a bra with a prosthetic for a few months until the infection resolved. So, Bobogirl, I'm so sorry for everything you are going through. Any setback is always a heart break. I hope things work out for you.",

I understand the recommendation for the chemo since I'm young (36 y/o) and my oncotype score came back at 32 (high recurrence risk) but my er/pr status was only weakly positive (20%). With all the side effects of anti-hormone therapy, I'm not sure the benefit/risk is worthwhile. I have an appointment for a second opinion at Moffitt cancer hospital in Tampa on 1/15. I'll decide for sure after that. Sam2U...I'm sure you are beautiful, lopsided or not...Warrior_woman...I love the name. Very powerful💪",

I wonder why they choose one or the other... Marren- I've heard good things about the glutamine. I haven't had any peripheral neuropathy so far so I haven't used it. Diamond lil- hope you have a great weekend and enjoy that walk on the beach! It's winter in Florida, but we get some good beach weather too. Hopefully it will warm up this weekend. So...I am 10 days post my first chemo and just got my period. I was expecting chemopause, so I'm a little surprised. Otherwise, I feel pretty good. I'm glad we get a little recoup time before getting knocked on out butts again. I just have some minimal hair shedding but am gonna shave it once it starts coming out in clumps.
