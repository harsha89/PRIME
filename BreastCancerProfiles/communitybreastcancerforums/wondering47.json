    "Content": "wondering47 wrote: I've been experiencing pain in my left breast for three months. I went in for a breast exam, and was told it felt like fibrocystic changes. I've had three prior biopsies--one excisional, two needle core. All turned out to be benign tumors. Also, though in my early 40s, I've been told I have the breast density of an 18 year old. So I was sent for an U/S (it's been best in the past--mammos are useless). Last week, my OB's office called to say the results were benign. THEN today I received the actual radiologist's report in the mail, and found they had said I had a benign cyst in my right breast, and an \"ill-defined hypoechoic lesion with irregular borders\" at the same site in my left breast I have a palpable lumpy area and pain. Because this lesion is at the same site I had a lesion 4 years ago (a needle core biopsy showed a benign tumor), and it basically looks the same, the radiologist is not recommending any action. But I'm worried: When I had my last biopsy, right after they took the tissue they said there was nothing left that could be seen on the U/S--so the needle core had basically removed the whole area. So how can it be the same lesion? The radiologist won't talk to me, so I have to wait until Tuesday for my OB to come back from vacation..... Has anyone had a benign biopsy that basically removed the observable tissue and then had cancer or another benign tumor return at the exact same site? Or is it just likely scar tissue?
