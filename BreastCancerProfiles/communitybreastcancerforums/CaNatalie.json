This fourth chemo has really knocked me for a loop. My fingertips feel funny so I am hoping they don't go numb. I also have yucky mouth so nothing sounds good to drink, except at night I start wanting ice water. Which means I am up all night going to the bathroom. Which shouldn't matter since getting a good night sleep seems to be a thing of the past (even with the aid of sleep meds). I am tired of being tired! Nicki- I lost all my hair two months ago and just alternate between hats, natural or wig...whatever feels most comfortable that day. Also, I am four chemo's in and my weight has pretty much been the same. So, weight gain is not for sure, and even if it is, it's only temporary. Karen-Thanks for sharing the poem, I really like it.  I am going to print it and post it by my bedside. Hugs to all! Natalie",

Linda-A big congratulations on finishing chemo! You are helping me see the light at the end of this dark tunnel. The story of your nurses and the pin brought tears to my eyes, how special! Lori- Thanks for the advice. Did you get back to a normal sleep pattern after chemo? I miss just being able to crawl into bed at night and go to sleep! Debbie-Sorry to hear about the loss of your friend from church.  Hope you get your red blood counts up or at least stable. Mine are always in the 9 range. Nicki- Hope your first chemo goes well, you will be in my thoughts Tuesday! I am also getting tissue expanders after chemo. My plastic surgeon really helped me understand the sizing questions, do you have a consult set up yet? Interesting he also said if my skin was holding up well and I did well in surgery he could possibly place the implants in at that time. Has anyone else heard of that? Cheryl-What a pain with your appointment! I have the same yucky se of taxotere! Yikes...will my nose ever stop running? I feel like just permanently shoving tissue paper up there. Ulla-I wish I could jump through this computer and just give you a hug. I am on taxotere and my hair fell out as well (was that your question?).  Sorry to hear of your friends wife's death. I think after getting dx hearing about anyone dying of cancer hits me harder now. You will get through this! You are a strong, beautiful and marvelous lady! I believe in you! Hope everyone else is doing well. I could not get through this without this site and all of you. Natalie",

However I get my neulasta shot tonight...yuck! Kara- Thanks for reminding me I am now more than 1/2 done! Yeaaaaa! Also, I liked your post about the warm welcome back to work. I will hopefully being going back in May-June...so it made me excited to think about getting back in the swing of things as well as good reminder that there is a life after all this. Karyll- I totally feel you on the gatorade. I have come to love the lemonlime flavor, especially blended with ice in our blender for those yucky mouth days. Karen R.- Hope you and your family feel better soon! Hope everyone is doing well and able to enjoy the upcoming holidays. My Husband's birthday is in couple days and I am willing myself to feel well enough to make it a nice all about him (for a change!). Lots of hugs, Natalie",

I know how it feels to get this kind of news being so young. We are definitely a smaller few who get dx in our 20's. Getting cancer at our age is far from anything we could have prepared ourselves for. It does help to draw strength from others going through this and if it weren't for the ladies (of all ages) on this site I would be lost. I like your outlook and positive thoughts.  I am currently on Tax and carbo and tolerating rather well, but there are some yucky days. Losing my hair was hard and can still be emotional. Well, I just wanted to let you know there is someone else here your age group if you want to talk.  Best wishes to you on your new plan of tx! Take Care, Natalie",

Lori-Thanks for sharing you had similar pain. You are right about mentioning it to my Doctor and I will. Dakota- I love your name and picture! It's your second time around and your going strong! Thanks for reminding me of the se of bone pain from both meds. Ulla-You will make it through this chemo hell! Good luck on your first treatment of taxotere. I am sorry you hurt, I know how you feel and am sending gentle hugs your way. My bone scan came back clean to, thanks for reminding me of that and not to worry. Thanks again ladies for the warm welcome and peace of mind (at least till the next hypochondriac crisis). Natalie",

I am getting ready for bed as I have #5 chemo tomorrow, the next (and LAST will be January 28th), it feels so good to know I will be done at the end of this month. However, I am feeling so sore and achy I can't imagine two more doses of this stuff. I am sick of being sick, tired of being tired....however you ladies all help me see the light! Even if it is sometimes barley flashing, it is there. Cheryl-That really was an amazing Barbie house...what great memories. Plus a toy that will be played with a long time and not lose its appeal by next month. Karen R.-What a beautiful picture. Your little guy sure is cute! Nicki-Glad to hear you're hanging in there. I don't have kids (yet) so I know what you mean about it being somewhat of a relief to just have to worry about yourself. My hat goes off to all the moms with kids at home and caretakers...you ladies really rock. Karen-Hope you and your husband feel better soon. At least you can really justify being \"couch potatoes\" together. Kara- That must feel so good to be back to working, even if it is not full time. I miss working more than I thought I would.  Hope everything continues to go well with the tamoxifen. Hope everyone is well and feeling strong. Natalie",

I am doing neoadjuvant chemo and started carboplatin and taxotere in October and have had three treatments with three more to go. I get the neulasta shot after every treatment. I was wondering if any of you had rib pain associated with chemo (not surgery or rads)? My ribcage feels sore and of course I think the worse that the cancer has spread. But it didn't start till I started chemo and I thought it is rare for the cancer to spread during chemo.  Just hoping someone can calm my fears with a similar side effect! Natalie",

I decided to do chemo first and then surgery to ensure my tumor responded to the chemo. I have had three treatments of taxotere and carboplatin and wonder if it is even affecting my tumor. I have lost my hair and my periods so I know it's affecting something.  Part of the problem is after my biopsy the area where my tumor is swelled and felt much larger than the MRI reported size. At my last MD visit she said it felt \"less pronounced\". But how do I know that is not just the swelling subsiding? Being triple negative puts so much emphasis on finding the right chemo regimen.  Should I be feeling a difference by now? My main question is....for those who did chemo could you feel a difference in your lump and if so after how many treatments? Any info or input would be much appreciated.
