This was followed by 4 weeks of radiation where I had no side effects except that I started getting a little pink after the end of the treatment. The important first step is to connect with a surgeon that you feel comfortable with and take each step at a time.",

I have had this every time I had a mammogram so that it was always followed up with an ultrasound. My cancer was not detected on a mammogram, but the follow up ultrasound showed something that a biopsy confirmed was cancer. So in your case, it would probably be best to have a follow ultrasound to confirm that there is nothing there.",

I looked at their computer modeling and I could see how they were having the radiation beam at an angle so that it was just on the breast. You should talk to your RO about your concerns, they were very patient with me wanting to look at their computer modeling before the radiation treatment started.",

I was a total mess until I had a definite plan and then I was anxious to get going with the treatment. It is not surprising that it is hard to wrap your head around all this, no one expects to get breast cancer and the news is a total shock. I remember one thing that kept me positive: a friend of mine who had been through this told me to remember that there will soon be a time when the last thing you think of at night and the first thing you think of in the morning will no longer be breast cancer.",
