I just hate that it's still on the same side as 6 months ago and that there was a change (that much she did tell me).  I've had mammos is the same place each time, so they have my whole history.  So tomorrow I go back in for a recheck and ultrasound and we'll see from there.  Big sigh....... i can feel something in the area they are looking at and I don't like how it feels.  This one may have to go to MRI etc if they try to tell me it's nothing again.   Anyway - back on the stress bus.  Yuck.

      "Content": "magsandmattsmom wrote: And tired of thinking this everytime something happens.  I've posted in the past about my migraine auras.  During the month of January I was having them an average of one every 4 days.  One lasted 90 minutes.  I'd had enough so I went to my neurologiest to see what he could do.  Well he put me on some preventative meds.  And he took blood to see if I have some antibodies.  What he said was there was a slight risk i had cancer cells that were attacking something that was affecting my neurological system creating these syptoms.  He was doubtful that was the case but wanted to rule it out. He specializes with working with people with cancer.  Ok here's the part I don't know if I should worry about.  For the last two days I've had a continous \"aura\".  It's not full blown like my others where flashing lightening bolts take over my vision, but I've got the flashes and at times it seems like the lower outer corners have blind spots.  Should I be concerned??????? My onc gave me a brain MRI in Aug that was clean and the neurologiest didnt' see a need for another (and neither do i). Any thoughts would be great.  I'm sorry if I sound like a broken record Jill - Not taking herself too seriously!

Since my heart surgery in April I've been having eye issues.  I start to get these zig zag flashing lines in my eyes.  They last like 15 minutes.  At first I thought they were just my body recovering but they've continued.  I talked to my cardiologiest and he didn't see any reason for them from the surgery.  Called my onc and they raised no red flags for him.  Went to my eye dr and got a thorough exam - nothing.  The general theory is that they are the auroa for a migraine but no headache BUT I have noticed I get a headache quite often after them but not a bad one.  Ok here's the silly part - as always my mind goes to BC.  So I went to that brain mets website and some of what they say sounds like them.  Flashing lights etc.  Sigh.  Now what to question? I have an appt with my onc Aug 7th so I know that I can wait til then.  What I guess I'm looking for is some reassurance that it's nothing .  So?  Thoughts?  Thanks for allowing my craziness!
