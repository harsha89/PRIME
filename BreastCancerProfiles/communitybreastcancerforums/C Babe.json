Days 4-6 are the tough ones for me, with body aches, headache, irregularly, and big-time fatigue. Then on day 7-8 I feel like a load has lifted. Things I've found to be critical are: Miralax starting on the day after treatment, Claritin to alleviate the Neulasta bone-pain, and pre-emptive Tylenol or Advil to take care of the headaches and body aches. My appetite has never waned (boo-hoo) although my tastebuds get killed for the week after treatment! The wig is working well, but very itchy for me, too -- I'm using Eucerin Calming Creme on my head and that seems to help. Still, can't wait to whip off the wig at night before bed.
