Now that it is over I am glad I did it but the first couple of days it was tough. I still feel swollen, not sure if that is normal. I laughingly call the insertion the \"holy shit\" phase and the removal the \"thank The Lord\" phase.",

Firstly, my oncologist will only insert a cath within 2 weeks of original surgery. So, if you are just diagnosed and interested in brachy make your appointment to see your radiologist within a week of surgery. Second, if you have the choice, have your radiation oncologist insert and remove the device. It will save you considerable time and trouble. Professional courtesy would dictate sending you back to your surgeon. In my case, she was out of town so my oncologist inserted the device. It took some painful adjustment to seat the SAVI just right with cat scans between each. If I would have gone to the surgeon for insertion I think it would have been worse.",

The incision is healing nicely but I still can't swim for a week or two, that's tough in AZ in the summer time! This stills feels like a bad dream that I hope I wake up from. Next stop is the hematology oncologist and AI Inhibitors. So not looking forward to that. I am ever hopeful that I will do well on the meds and life a normal life.",

Until I met with the rad oncologist I had no idea if I was a candidate for brachytherapy. I was, sitting here with what I call the beater in my breast! It is day 3 of treatments using a SAVI device. Insertion was a bitch, I was second guessing the lumpectomy option while the device was being \"adjusted\". I had pain meds left over from surgery and I used them for about 24 hours. After that it got easier and I think my regrets were over although sleeping is still uncomfortable. If you can't take time off work for a week this would be very difficult. No showers, tough to bend over without discomfort, driving a manual car would be awful. By the end of the week I will know more but so far I am doing ok.",
