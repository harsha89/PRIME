I have no lump but I have a symptom that may or not be relevant...itching nipple in that breast. Wonder if that could be significant. I'm calling my GP tomorrow to ask about the letter. From what I have read at my age (62) calcifications are \"debris\" from dead cancer cells. That alone sounds scary to me! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "bc2445sb wrote: Had mammo on 6/7 and repeat on 6/29 due to a \"new cluster of microcalcifications\". 6/29 mammo rad. report says \"tiny cluster of microcalcifications...which are relatively smooth and may be conforming to a rounded configuration, suggesting benign etiology\". But it also says my breasts are \"heterogeoeously dense which limites the sentivity of mammography\". In reading new research it says that breast density now rates up with age and heredity as a prime risk of breast cancer. I'm wondering if I should contact the radiologist and see if a different type of mammography might be a good idea instead of waiting. Waiting makes me nervous. The other little thing that bugs me and I don't know if I mentioned it to my Dr. is that my nipple on that breasts itches most of the time...not to the extreme, just a tingling itchy feeling from time to time but every day. I've heard the radiologists won't talk to the patient. Is that true? Log in to post a reply",
