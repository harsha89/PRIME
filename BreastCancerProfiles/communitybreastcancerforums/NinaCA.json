I then had 14 great years on femara (liver met disappeared) I was no longer considered MBC but I knew I had circulating cancer cells somewhere in my blood. Liver met again in 2015 just in time to take advantage of the \"just on the market\" ibrance/fasloddx duo. I had surgery for the liver met in 2015 but markers are now beginning to rise again, CT scan in a month or so. The idea is to stay around long enough for the next generation of effective medication. I must admit when I got the first MBC diagnosis I looked for people who had survived and was surprised to find several people that gave me hope. I found hearing from survivors is very helpful. Happy Holidays to all. HUGS",

I woke up from surgery to find the surgeon, who was there to help the IR doc with his camera so he could hold back the gall bladder, telling me he decided to do a laparoscopic resection to make sure he got everything instead of just an ablation. My recovery is doing very well I'm told, only 5 small holes with some abdominal pain still, no pain meds anymore though. I did go to the ER last night because I had a fever for a second night in row so they wanted to check for infection. Everything is just fine, no need to worry. I plan on continuing on Faslodex and the scans and markers will let me know if and when I have to start Ibrance which was quite effective. I\"m very curious as to what happens to the tumor markers if there is no tumor left. Nina :)",

Before that Femara kept the tumors away. I am very sensitive to estrogen and removing it from my system has worked on my type of tumor. Of course I became aware of my tumor after taking Hormone Replacement Therapy for only 9 months, tumor just ballooned up. Our tumors are all so different and its hard to know what is the best for our own personal tumor. Good luck in your search for finding a good match. Nina :)",

When I quickly looked it up, it didn't mention liver but it sounds like a promising form of radiation therapy for difficult to reach tumors. Kathy, are they suggesting you start the chemo and see if the tumor shrinks before giving it the cyberknife? I just looked up a comparison between cyberknife and RFA to see what the difference was. I never really knew about cyberknife but see it has some good uses \"CyberKnifeÂ® detects minute body movements and fine-tunes the irradiation angle using a seeker.\" It's newer than RFA and all the comparison studies are about Liver cancer, not metastatic breast cancer. Don't know if the results apply to both cancers. They showed no difference in outcome between the two procedures but cyberknife, more expensive of course, had an edge with difficult to find tumors.

I was wondering if anyone on this thread has had part of their liver taken out (hepatectomy), minor surgery, or had intervential radiology (using microwaves) to remove a BC liver met? I was diagnosed with a liver met in 2001 and it disappeared after 6 months of taking letrozole (what a miracle!). I took letrozole for 14 years but a liver met finally made an unwanted return this summer. I have reduced the size of it with Faslodex and Ibrance and my turmor markers dropped way down (but still not in the normal range). Now comes the decision of what to do. I talked to a surgeon yesterday who talked about many of the options. He will bring up my case before a tumor board next week. I just want to know if anyone has gone through surgery for their liver mets and what were the results. He said I was an \"out of the box\" situation since they don't usually recommend surgery for BC liver mets but I only have one and am in good health otherwise. Thanks for any information you can give me. ",

It's been 10 months since I started the IBRANCE/Faslodex combo and even though the markers have come down to 51 and the tumor has shrunk to 14mm x 12 mm I'm considering surgery/ablation, I think it's time. Tumor Board says I can do whatever I want including continue on just the medication. I have talked to Boo, Denise, Longtermsurvivor, Leftfoodforward and Barb but was wondering if anyone else out there has anything to say about RFA (RadioFrequencyAblation) or laparoscopic removal of liver/tumor, or a liver resection for a BC liver met. I know the RFA could lead to a resection if the blood supply gets compromised. I know there are ongoing studies at the moment but none really aimed at which procedure might be the best if a procedure is chosen. My gut (or my fear of pain) tells me try least invasive first. Thanks for all the information you share and post on this website. It's great knowing there's a pool of sisters out there ready to help with her experience. Nina :)",

The mini review on OMBC was excellent (Oligometastatic Breast Cancer-learned a new word)- I'm in Northern California, Bay Area, a Kaiser patient. Are you the Stephanie that posts on Smart Patient? Not sure what the difference is between SIRT, RFA and Microwave ablation and the difference in outcomes if there is any. This is a great place to gather first hand experiences on less frequent problems I don't feel so unusual. ",
