Part of me knew that I shouldn't have (see my FB post, below)....but I did, and within minutes, my inbox started filling up... Stating one's bra color for BC awareness is ignorant + insensitive. HOW THE FUCK DOES A WOMAN WHO HAS HAD HER CANCEROUS BREAST(S) REMOVED ANSWER THIS QUESTION? To deepen \"awareness\", walk/run a race, hold someone's hand during chemo, or help clean/cook/watch kids for someone in treatment. But this game? It is a sad +pointless reminder of what women like myself have lost. Please stop. It is not helping. I don't have a question for you all, per se; rather, I suppose I'm looking for an indication that somebody understands how I feel...the women on FB are just not getting it, and I'm pretty much in tears having read their frivolous posts about wearing purple bras, pink lacy bras, leapord print bras,...you get the idea...
