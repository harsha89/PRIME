Waiting to talk to the MO can sometimes be as bad as waiting for the CT results to be posted through the online portal. Let's hope that conversation happens soon. I also got my CT results yesterday. Unfortunately, Ibrance and Faslodex have failed me after just a few months. I too have progression in my liver and a new met at T9. I suspect my MO will be calling me today to let me know that \"Houston, we have a problem\". I am guessing that Xeloda will be in my very near future with possible rad to the T9 met. I had so hoped for a long run on Ibrance and Faslodex. I also have a mild pleural effusion AND bibasilar atelectasis. Sheesh....really! My guess is that the mild pleural effusion is placing just enough pressure on my lungs to cause the bibasilar atelectasis. I should probably start to rethink the elevation that we live and play at. Since there are no clinical trials for MBC currently going at our Cancer Center I may start to look out on the west coast. I have lots of family out there so going out for treatment might be a possibility. Hugs to you and prayers to all.",

This has been a symptom for awhile and seems to be getting worse or more frequent. I had expressed this to my MO back in June. She checked with pharma regarding side effects to the various drugs for both cancer and the partial hand paralysis. Pharma assured her that the meds I was on should not be causing an issue. During my last visit in August we decided that we needed to get a scan. I do not know if this issue was present on the scans I had in June and the radiologist just did not mention the issue or if this is new. One of the causes of the partial collapse can be a result of surgery. I was on the OR table for 12 hours July '16 while they did major reconstruction on my back due to spinal tumors and a collapse causing spinal cord compression...hence the partial hand paralysis. No mets in the lungs...knock on wood. Hopefully my MO will call be this week and we can get this all sorted out. Z...may the luck of my Irish ancestors travel with you on this journey.

I have not responded to hormonals,(high probability mutation related), to CDK4/6 inhibitors (high probability mutation related), and the very strong Madame X (high probability mutation related). Unfortunately I also have the PTEN mutation. That alone sends shivers down my spine. Technically speaking Afinitor is the only drug the report recommended. After doing some research on the PTEN mutation I found that PARP inhibitors may also work but I am ER/PR+, HER2- and currently PARP inhibitor trials are designed for those who are triple neg. so couldn't even try one in combination with Afinitor if I wanted to.

As far as insurance goes...by any chance do you have a nurse case manager with your insurance company? If so call them immediately and explain what is happening. If you do not have one call the customer service number on the back of your insurance card and tell them you need one immediately and ask that they call you before the end of the day. Nurse case managers are responsible for coordination of care between all parties (you, your doctor, and the insurance company), and they are also your eyes and voice behind the scenes. Next, do you have private or government insurance? If you have private insurance, immediately call the Ohio state insurance commission and get the phone number for your state insurance ombudsman. Call their office and let them know your situation and that you need help. If you have government insurance: for Medicaid, call the Ohio state Medicaid office and ask for help. Each state is a little different but they may have a Medicaid ombudsman that the Medicaid office will refer you to or will assign you a case worker who will immediately start working for you. If you have Medicare, contact the office for Medicare for your area. You can find the phone number on the web by typing in Medicare and your state. If the insurance company denies the request, immediately demand a fair hearing. Depending on the insurance company either you or your MO's office on your behalf will need to request this. The insurance company may require a peer-to-peer with your MO and one of their medical directors prior to a request for a fair hearing. I know this is a lot of information and instruction but you need to get answers now and not a week from now. The above referenced nurse case managers are NOT the same as a navigator associated with your MO's clinic/office. Two different missions in scope. They do work together from time to time but they are not one in the same. Praying for you and your family and that you get answers ASAP.",

It is a diagnostic tool which helps pin point areas of activity. It is through CTs and MRIs with and without contrast that we see what is actually going on. Kind of like the differences between a \"screening\" and a diagnostic mammo. The differences between CTs and MRIs is also specific depending on the purpose and organ that is being imaged. Different doctors will prefer different images. For example, MRIs are the gold standard for soft tissue spinal imaging and are the gold standard for brain imaging. CTs work very well for bone and some soft tissues whereas MRIs do not. CTs are also fast so that if you are in an emergency situation a CT can give images in a matter of minutes v.s. a very, very, long exam time for an MRI. So there truly is not a perfect answer when it comes to which one should or should not be used. It really has to do with the intent and constraints associated with the body part. If cost is of concern and an MRI has been ordered, I would ask the ordering physician if the MRI would give better results over the CT. If their answer is something as simple as \"I just like the MRI better\", then ask about the CT. The cost is much less. Just as a wonky note for all of us moms, the major exception in the use of MRIs v.s. CT tests is in children. MRIs are always preferred in this population because an MRI does not use radiation however MRIs often will require anesthesia. Kiddos have a very hard time laying perfectly still for long periods of time not to mention become quite frightened by all that clanging. So if you have a kiddo that the doc wants to do a CT on and it is not an emergency, question them as to why a CT and not an MRI or xray. Question, question, question.",

With a smaller dosage Dani may get just enough relief without knocking her completely out or messing with her ability to function normally. One thing about opiods is that an increase may be necessary at some point in time. Everyone is a bit different as to when this begins to happen but for some it can be a very, very, long time. Perhaps a pain management specialist would be the perfect person to consult with. Different pain meds work better on different types of pain and a specialist might be just the ticket to help sort this all out. I hope Dani finds relief soon.

It looks like the holidays are fast approaching and everyone is spending time with family and friends, cooking, baking, and finding pleasure in snow, lights, and warm wishes. I have a liver bx on Thursday so need to run to get my blood work done and pick up my Xeloda at the cancer center. I just don't seem to be very motivated today. I need to just get up. Have any of you had trouble getting your pain medication? Last script I got from my MO was about 4 months ago. Interesting conversation around that script. MO stated that a colleague had been reprimanded by the state for his pain med scripts...really...an MO prescribing pain meds to cancer patients. This sent a chill through my bones. In this current climate we seem to be painting broad brush strokes regarding pain med scripts and many people who are in need of these meds are not going to get them because we can't seem to differentiate appropriate and inappropriate usage. I take gabapentin for nerve pain and when I went to get the pain med script filled I asked the pharmacist about med interactions. The pharmacist looked at me and very sarcastically told me the pain med should only be used PRN. I looked at her with daggers shooting out of my eyes and told her yes, I knew that. I then proceeded to tell her that it was her job under her licenses to provided the medication prescribed by my medical practitioner under their licenses. I then looked at her and informed her I had stage IV cancer. She became very quiet. I sure hope that in the future our conversation will play back in her head as she addresses others.",

The medication has to be refrigerated so they will take it out prior to your injections to warm. You might let them know you are willing to warm the vials while you wait. To do this just tuck one vile under each arm pit to warm. The nurses may also give you the option of having your injections at the same time by two different nurses. I have had it given one injection at a time and two at a time. I really don't have a preference but at least you may be able to decide how you might want the medication administered. If the med hurts going in don't be afraid to ask the nurse to slow down. This med is thick so slowing down the administration rate helps. If you get the injection one at a time while standing, point your toes on the side receiving the injection, to the floor like a ballerina. If both hips at the same time try to lean on something to take the weight off of your hips. Hope this info gives you a little idea of what to expect.",

I can't tell you how nice it was to see that others have already worked through some of the same issues I am having and that you all were there to support and share your experiences with me. I am trying to clean out closets but like you Micmel, just taking a shower can be exhausting. I have so much junk that needs to be taken care of but find it can be exhausting to even think about it. I tell myself that if I just take a small section at a time it will all be taken care of before I have time to blink. This morning I washed the kitchen cabinet above the range. With the change in time, the light coming through the kitchen window highlighted my lack of cleaning over the last year. I could not stand it any longer. Mets in my spine caused a total collapse of T1. Long story short, I had back surgery last July. It consisted of 7 levels being fused and a laminectomy at T1. This left me with partial paralysis of both hands and arms. I have mobility but it is very weak and I do not have feeling in my hands and arms hence some house cleaning chores have gone unattended to. I have started working on a notebook that tells my family how to proceed after I am gone since they refuse to participate now.Even though they do not want to think about that day, it will come and I have to figure out a way to make it easier for them as I fear they are really going to have a tough time at it. Scans tomorrow. This will be the first scans since switching to Xeloda last month. Fingers crossed. ",

I grew up on a ranch and I absolutely know the amount of work that goes into caring for any animal. It sounds like you are struggling with how to move forward. I live in the suburbs and often wish I could buy a very small house with land and animals but I always come back to the fact that my life is limited and what do I really want to spend my time doing. Currently I plan work around my weeks off treatment. I know that on day 3 of my week off I have more energy. That day is when I do my planning. I make a list of what I would like to get done on days 4, 5, 6 and 7. I have never been a list maker but find it is very helpful. If I don't make the list I become overwhelmed with what I feel I need to get done which in turn causes me to try to do too much. I become exhausted and then feel horrible both mentally and physically. Basically, if I am totally honest about it, I just sit and cry. Minnie -- Welcome. I think you are going to like it here. Lots of support from others who understand what you are feeling emotionally and physically. Lynne -- What the h*ll!. As a nurse I can tell you that no one knows how long anyone has to live unless you are in the active stage of dying. I hope you smile at her every time you go into her office and are wearing a great big button that has 5 1/2 on it. She needs to be reminded that with all of the great new treatments we have the old live expectancy statistics are just that, old. They need to be retired. Melt downs -- ahhhh, that pain in my arse. I have to remind myself that they are going to happen as well as fatigue and all the other side effects that this disease can bring on. But I will go to sleep and tomorrow may be much better. I have to remind myself that even though my family loves me they don't need to go through cancer too so with that said, I need to muster the energy to get busy Christmas shopping. I think wrapping and seeing gifts under the tree will make them feel loved and normal if just for awhile. Hugs and much love to all.",

I have remarked to my husband on several occasions that we no longer have friends; just old acquaintances. Seems everyone we knew just disappeared after finding out I had MBC. For me I am saddened by this but it is my DH that I really feel bad for. There will come a day when I am gone but for him, not only will he have lost me but what should have been his support network has also abandoned him simply because of me. This thought breaks my heart. Now on to brighter thoughts. Have any of you discovered Meet Up groups yet? We have belonged to a couple of groups over the years and they can be very fun. The most recent one that we have joined is a fly fishing group. My husband and I have been fly fishing for some time now and just recently discovered this group. I thought this might be a great way to acquire new friends who do not know about my dx. My hope is that my husband will develop new relationships through this group that he may continue to enjoy after I am gone. Minnie, you brought a smile to my face when you mentioned sitting up late at night talking with friends and family in Ireland. I am from a very large, very Irish family. Oh my goodness can we talk! When my husband first met me he stated that he was so lost when my family would get together because he couldn't keep up with the conversations. When I quizzed him about this statement he said \"goodness, I have never seen or heard a group of people who can sit around a table and have not one but several topics of conversation going on all at the same time and all of you can respond jumping in an out\". I laughed at him and asked him if it wouldn't be boring and dull if there was only one topic of conversation at a time. He looked at me with a very inquisitive look on his face. Well after 28 years of marriage he can somewhat keep up but still shakes his head from time to time because he has missed part of the conversation. ",

First let me say that the NP who came to the holding area to education and get my signature for the procedure and blood explained that because of where the tumors where located on my liver there was a high probability that they may have to go through the lower part of the lung to get to the tumor. WOW, ok. Then it was time for the procedure. I was on the table and received a light amount of the conscience sedation medication, my abdomen was prepped, and everyone in the room introduced themselves. There are several IRs in the room. We start with an ultra sound. IR states that we can't visualize the tumors which was not surprising since the tumors are on one of the interior lobes. He stated that he wanted to see if we could do this under ultra sound first because it is the least invasive. Next we do a CT scan. Still can't visualize the tumors. The IR states we are going to try the dye but once we start the procedure they are going to have to work very quickly due to the rapid cannibalization of the dye. So we proceed to inject the dye and then run the CT scan. You guessed it, they can't visualize the tumors. This all results in no biopsy. The IRs were so excited and asked how long I had been on Xeloda. When I told them I was just finishing the 2nd round they really were excited and told me Merry Christmas you have tumors that have shrunk to the point that they can't be visualize. My last scan was the 19th of November and the tumors were definitely visible at that point which means in 4 weeks the tumors shrunk. He also assured me that they are their for me if those tumors start to misbehave sometime in the future and he stated he hoped that was an extremely long time down the road. He again wished me a Merry Christmas and much joy in the news. I came home and slept most of the day. I did not even want to get up this morning. Lazy bones! Thank you all for your well wishes.

My son is out on the west coast so did a quick phone conversation with he and his family. Have had significant pain in my left hip over the past few days. Had to take pain meds. I will usually try heat, ice, and ibuprofen before I reach for the narcs but this time none of my usually go to's worked so had to take the narcs. It did take the edge off but did not take the pain completely away. I have mets in my lower back and right hip but the left side hip pain is new. It is raining today. First moisture we have had in over 100 days. Unfortunately it is not a big soaking rain which we so desperately need. Start my next X cycle on Friday with all of its side effects so trying to get my meal menus and shopping lists done for next week. We eat Vegan/Vegetarian during the week and have chicken on the weekends. I am finding it harder and harder to get the energy up and to deal with hand and foot syndrome while trying to prepare meals so I have come up with a binder system divided by weeks. I place recipes with similar ingredients into the week and then shop and prep. Because the recipes have similar ingredients it helps cut down on planning, shopping, and prep time during the week. Wishing everyone a wonderful day.",

This truly has limited my ability to pick up on the pre-MBC hobbies. I was on Ibrance/Faslodex prior to Madame X. I did have fatigue while on it, however Madame X fatigue is much worse for me. This might be a little bit of TMI but I am so fatigued that there are times when I think to myself that I am to fatigued to even get up to go to the restroom. Usually by the 3rd day off the drug I get my energy back and that is when I do all of the meal stuff. I am on a 7 days on / 7 days off cycle. Mae I love to garden. Pre-MBC I was really getting into hydroponic gardening. I live in a gated community and have limitations as to what I can do in my yard and god forbid a greenhouse. I love this basement hydroponic garden: youtube.com/watch?v=jAUv5YxIkS4 I believe that the person who developed this system is an educator. He has some great advice regarding what veggies grows well in hydroponic systems and what veggie's do not. Grannex, feel better soon. In the mean time, fluids, sleep, fluids, and some serious movie time. Minnie, have fun and enjoy every moment. Hugs to all.",

I am so happy for her retirement but sad for me because she has been with me every since my first diagnosis. My new MO is very good so I am not too worried about my care going forward.

Runor, when I read about your bladder issues I thought WOW, I am not the only one. I have had blood in my morning void but it clears through out the day. Urinalysis says nothing going on. I have a ton of scans tomorrow so we may have answers in a day or two. Saw my new MO last week and we are baselining before we start a new treatment. Technically all the treatments I have had since February have not worked so we need to move and move quickly to something and cross our fingers for success. Here is hoping and praying that every one has a better week.",

My liver bx that is schedule at the crack of dawn tomorrow will be my first. Even though I am a retired perioperitive nurse, I would be telling a fib if I said I wasn't a bit nervous. My tumors are not in a location that is easy to get to so I suspect I will be pretty sore after. The tissue will be used for receptor confirmation and will also be sent to F1. My MO has ordered a pathologist to be present to look at the tissue immediately to assure we have cancer cells in the samples that we collect. She has also ordered a CT guided instead of ultrasound. Again, the tumors are in a couple of tough areas to get to.",

I had a very large lesion at T1 that caused a pathological fracture and an eventual collapse of the vertebra that caused a narrowing of the neural foramen placing pressure on the spinal cord. Lesions were also found at T3 and T4. This caused numbness and tingling of both arms and hands with eventual loss of hand function. I had spinal surgery in July that consisted of a fusion from C5-T4 with instrumentation and laminectomy at T1. This was followed up by a C-collar 24/7 and then Physical Therapy which started 4 months after the surgery. Some question that are specific to a cancer patient that you may want to ask if and when surgery is recommended: Hugs and positive thoughts are on the way from my house to yours. ",

Please, please, take time for yourself during all of the business that comes with this disease and family. I am praying for you, KD, and your whole family. JFL, I am sorry to hear about your progression but I have confidence in your next treatment. Momallthetime, as many have indicated on this board, at a metabolic level, cancer loves sugar. A PET/CT is often used to identify cellular changes. When you have a PET/CT you are given a radio tracer in a glucose solution. The glucose is taken up by the cancer cells and with the help of the radio tracer we are able to see those areas that eat up all that glucose and \"light up.\" This is why you are asked to limit your sugar/carbohydrate consumption several days before the scan. A CT is often done with radio tracing contrast and without to monitor and detect any changes in the specific organ that the PET/CT had identified earlier. https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/pet-scan. I saw my MO yesterday and I will be moving on to palbociclib and fulvestrant. After 9 months on liposomal doxorubicin we had exceeded (by a lot) the life time max dosing. While it got me to NED as shown on the Feb scans we decided it was time to move to a new treatment. We did a 3 month flush and break from all treatment. My scans last week showed a new met on my liver and that one of the previous mets had increased in size. Start the new treatment on Friday with the fulvestrant first and will start the palbociclib at the end of June when my hubby and I get back from our fly fishing trip. Here is wishing you all a day of dancing, loving, and laughing.",

That is why your company contracts with BCBS of IL which is owned by Health Care Services Corporation (HSCS). Medical policy is a policy that HCSC uses to determine medical coverage. Medical policy is not developed by your company's HR department so even if your HR department \"approved\" you for those services BCBS could still deny the services and would not pay for them. I would go back to my IR and ask that they get a formal approval or denial from BCBS. You should receive a formal approval/denial letter in the mail from BCBS. ",
