I know I'm not a doctor but I really do not believe that the swelling and pain is from previous injury... any thoughts anyone? ",

I was also wondering why my onco is putting me on 5 yrs of tamoxifin but tells me he doesn't need to see me unless I develop other symptoms, shouldn't he be following up at least for a while after I start the med??? I just have this feeling I am being pushed aside and told what they think I want to hear.  He did give me a list of symptoms, but it just seems that there should be someone following me and asking questions being that I have no idea if something small could be a problem or not unless I start asking questions hear... which by the way is an amazing site with all of you amazing ladies, I am so happy I started reading here it really helps calm me when I start freaking out, so thank you all <3",

I can't thank all of you ladies enough for the support, laughs and even for the good cries I've had reading your posts and knowing I'm not alone and will not be alone.  To the DH's posting for your wives you are wonderful it's awesome to get the updates (I wish my DH knew how to use a computer) May I ask why some have had overies removed and some not and if you do have them removed do you still need hormone therapy? like the tamoxifin?
