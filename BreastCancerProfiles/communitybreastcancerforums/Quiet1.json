    "Content": "Quiet1 wrote: I have dense, fibrocystic breasts but in one breast, have 2 fibroadenomas and multiple cysts. I have had severe pain in this same breast for the last almost 2 years. And the pain has never moved from one particular spot. The first doctor told me I am too young for cancer, being in my 30's and the \"second opinion\" told me if I have pain I do not have cancer. No tests done,just his opinion. The pain is so severe that I can only wear a sports bra and at times cannot even sleep on that side. There is also swelling in that breast. So I guess my question is, how much pain do fibrocystic breasts cause? And is it usually only one?Â  Log in to post a reply",
