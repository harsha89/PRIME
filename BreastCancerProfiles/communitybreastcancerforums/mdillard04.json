Diagnosed Stage IV on June 8, 2015 with two small lesions in the liver. Utterly devastated to find out it was cancer to begin with, but to find out it was stage 4?? Still hard to comprehend. I am 36, not married, but am in a relationship that would lead to marriage and of course my significant other wants kids... Which now I can't give him. It has been such an emotional rollercoaster over this past month. I am trying to carry on as normal, but of course I have to embrace what my new normal is. I am optimistic and hopeful for a long life, but I won't lie that the statistical prognosis sits in the front of my brain. Started treatment two weeks ago, Ibrance and Femara along with a once a month Zoladex shot. So far so good!! Monika",

I was a runner and used to love going to the gym to do a Body Combat class (Mixed Martial Arts style aerobics. I am still working full time and have no energy once I get home sometimes. Gained 21 lbs since starting my treatment plan and I am so discouraged that I will not lose some of this stomach fact that inherited from being forced into menopause. Also have horrible joint pain as well. I also think I need an accountability partner. Monika",

Did pretty good first cycle with little to no SE's. Yesterday I noticed my hands looked jaundice and they are swollen. Having a little pain or twinges in the liver area... Should I be overly concerned?? Monika",

I trusted him. Now look where I am...wondering how long I have left, will never be a mother, why marry as I will eventually leave my husband a widower? My family is so positive and telling me I will be around for a very long time. They are a wreck as well as I am the baby. Well I hope that is the case as there is so much that I wan't to see and do. I have two very small lesions in my liver and have no idea how long they have been there. I took my first Zoladex shot yesterday...and cried as I knew motherhood was gone for me. Ibrance and Letrozole started today. I am praying for as little side effects as possible. I just want to have a good quality of life and to be happy. I want to live!!! I want to see my dreams come true....I am resting on faith, strength, and courage. Monika",
