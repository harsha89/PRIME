Also I think it is very important to see what our risk factors were for having this complication so an exhaustive review of our cancer type, location, surgeries, axillary dissection vs SNB, chemos, rad timing and dose is certainly indicated.     ",

      "Content": "Jun 17, 2009 04:13PM - edited Jun 17, 2009 04:15PM by Erica35 I am so sorry to hear that Connie has had another complication.  Horner syndrome is a \"nerve condition that includes a drooping eyelid (ptosis), constricted pupil, sunken eyeball (enophthalmos) and lack of sweating on one side of the face.\" It is present in 50% of brachial plexus injuries involving the lower plexus (C7-T1). Radiation induced brachial plexopathy usually affects C5-C6 and thus Horner's is very rare in RIBP. Most of the time if Horner's is present in a woman with breast cancer the neurologist will suspect either a met to the upper lung or an enlarged lymph node pressing on the T1 region or direct metastatic invasion of the brachial plexus. I'm hopeful that Connie has been aggressively worked up to exclude mets as the cause of her Horner's. Just because it is rare in RIBP for someone to have Horner's doesn't mean it never happens but her docs should be sure. I'm hoping for quick relief for Connie.  Best, Erica ",

How long do you need to use it to start to see a difference?  Thank you to all of you who continue to investigate and bring your resources back here.  I am so grateful for all the work you do.    Best, Erica ",

Does weight loss or weight lifting make it better?  Right now I can't type with my right hand.  I can't open jars or turn keys and have trouble with buttons.  I don't mind the weakness as much as I do the numbness and burning pain.  Anyone able to summarize for me what they have done for the RIBP that has worked?  I'm glad that you are sharing the lymphadema tricks too but bigger issue for me is the RIBP pain.  Thank you all for sharing your success at living with this.  Erica",

I started this cancer road in July 2006 and had planned to be done with everything this month. Sadly due to treatment failures I had to have more surgery than planned and now will be entering into a one year chemo clinical trial after my rads. Wish I could have celebrated being done this month. Hope I gather strength for the next year and half of more chemo and treatment. Glad to hear most of you are finishing treatment. Congratulations!",

Coming off the decadron and stopping the anti-nausea meds and ativan definitely makes me irritable. I think all of us get a little crazy just from the chemo/meds. Hang in there Lisa and Sue. I'm hoping that it will get better with taxol. I'll be doing once weekly Taxol and hope nausea won't be such a big deal so I don't have to take all the nausea meds that mess with my brain. Take care, Erica",

Since starting taxanes (one dd taxol followed by 2 dd abraxane, one more abraxane to go)I have lost all my eyelashes and most of my eyebrows. The other hairs are starting to grow back. I never lost my arm hair. I have a friend who also lost her eyelashes and eyebrows on abraxane and one month after finishing the lashes and brows are all back. I'm hoping for quick return of my lashes as well. Congrats to those who are finished. My last one is Nov 28th!!!",

I started chemo with all of you in August last year but I haven't posted in a long while. After chemo I had 3 surgeries and then one hell of a miserable time with radiation and then end of May started another year of chemotherapy. I am on xeloda and avastin. So my end date is June 2008. Karen I wish you the best of luck on your surgery. I know what it is like to think you are reaching the finish line and to be told you have to do more. It does take a while to wrap your head around it. We do manage to muster up the energy to plow ahead somehow but it is tough. Good luck. Erica",
