I wish I had never gone for my first Mammo at all .... I could just leave it all alone and forget about it, but my kids and husband drive me crazy about it ... I know I sound like a stupid person, but I just dont like the idea of them sticking a drill gun in my Breast !  So many women on this board that has a birads 3 wants a biopsy, and here i have a birads 4 and dont want one, I asked the doctor twice cant i just come back in a few months, she said no i dont recomend that :(  I guess i just dont want to have to deal with it being cancer !! I smoke and have for many years god only knows what I have... I smoke more now because of this worrie ! im just very stupid !!!!! I feel like a baby.... I know they all say even my doctor you have a 78% chance it will be nothing but because I cant tell what kind of calcifications you have it is Indeterminate grouped calcifications we have to do a biopsy.. she said it can go with DCIS.  There are alot of women with breast cancer and it sure looks like alot  more than 20% !!! I just pray when I go If I go that they will have disapeared. Can that happen ? I made another appointment for next wed, I Have been praying to GOD that they are gone !!!! has anyone ever had that happen to them? Log in to post a reply",

How can they just say dcis after biopsy then when you get it out they can come back Nd say oh we found invasive cancer ??? I really don't like this , why don't they wait till they take it out before saying its dcis ? Log in to post a reply",
