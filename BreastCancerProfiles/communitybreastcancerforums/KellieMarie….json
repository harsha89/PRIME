This is my first time posting, although I have been using this website since diagnosed in September. I started TCH on Dec 18th. I am feeling much much better than I was during the first several days after the infusion. I mainly had digestive issues, nothing too terrible, and bone/body aches. I'm assuming the aches were from the Neulasta. I did take the Claritin twice daily, but still had issues. However, from what I've read, the pains could have been much, much worse. My main digestive issue was diarrhea. I'm actually still taking Imodium. I have a sensitive digestive system already, so I wasn't surprised. This was my main reason why I had to stay home from work for several days. The bathroom at my office is just too far away in an emergency! I tried fasting for 48 hours before and 24 hours after chemo to reduce side effects. Since I have nothing to personally compare this to, I have no idea how much this did or didn't help. Aside from the diarrhea and some nausea, my SEs aren't too bad so far, so I think I'll keep doing it. I may try a fasting mimicking diet next time however. Well if you made it this far, thanks for reading. Much love to all of you!",
