Wait and watch,watch it spread to my organs,he has said because it is in my lymphs that it is in my blood and it probably is somewhere else just not detectable yet.He told my that the nodes are not life thretening and will not kill me??He said we would consult with a radiation onc about rads but because the nodes are on both sides of my neck he is unsure this is possible and scared it will cause alot of damage.The other chemo choice was Gemzar and Carboplatnium,problem being Gemzar is not funded and I may have to pay for it.He has no other suggestions.He does review my case with many other oncs.This is unbelievable!!!!!",

I phoned my rad onc today and talked to her assistant and explained the situation and she will pass my message on to her on Monday.I told her my meeting yesterday was pointless and that I need to see My rad onc.She said \"well you will see her once a week when your rads start\"I said we don't even know If I can have rads to all the areas of concern and it is important that she phone me immediately.I also phoned my onc today and holly shit he answered the phone.He is at peace with everything,he said wait and talk to your rad onc she will know exactly what to do,he agreed that the right side is the side of concern and he hopes they can radiate it as well as the left side in a safe way.He gave me some logical talk and I feel much better.He said in 4 months with only 31 days of tx the nodes have behaved pretty well.He said we know they grow and they spread but in the last year they have only went from node to node and he is very confident that this wait for tx decision is not gone to cause me any major problems.I asked about rads vs chemo first and he said there is no right or wrong answer to this.He also said because I have had so much chemo he would like to see me take a break and do the radiation and if and when they pop back up we can do the chemo then.So I do feel better after talking with him but of course this me we are talkin about and Im still very concerned about the newer nodes pop in up,but I will go to bed tonight and feel a bit more at peace with this and pray that things will move a bit more smoothly.Again thank you all for your advise and for housing offers.O my gosh that was truly a wonderfully way to show how far we sister's will go to help another sister.Love you all,God bless........Dawn Ps..Tender so good to see you posting again and ty for the pm.C love you to pieces you are my rock.Wats,Marle,Robin and all ty.Steph we are close in age and if you ever want to chat just send me a pm and we can hook up............",

I say oh,ok but the big f word node is  still big and he says well we will just watch it and explains to me that the nodes will flare up and down with the effects of radiation so it takes time.He also recommends watching the video on utube sp? about the professor who has cancer,cant think of the guys name right now,said he watched it and thought of me and all of us.So go and live.Weird conversation but good.Still having a hard time with the wait factor but feel better.Sorry for the he said she said thing......Dawn",

They have nothing and don't know when I will be called back.In the mean time the cancer is progressing in some of the nodes,I can feel this.So I sit and wait while the cancer keeps on growing!!! I have had a total of 31 tx in 4 months.There is a nerve in the neck the rad onc mentioned today that is of concern,radiation can damage it and cause my arm and shoulder to be numb forever.The right side of neck is the worse and it needs the rads but now who knows,I may not be able to treat all the spots needed.So maybe there is no reason to rads if we can't do it to all spots.My rad onc did not seem to concerned about previous rads when I talked to her in Dec,she even said if we radiate and a year later they pop back up we radiate again no problem....Mass confusion.Hope she calls soon.....Thanks......Dawn",

So will rads be a good choice? It will clean up or debulk the ca in the nodes thats a good thing.It will not protect me from the rest of me!!Some say to only radiate if I'm having symptoms or pain,which I'm but what if the rads totally kill off the cancer,and I'm cancer free for awhile.By awhile,my onc said the cancer will  come back.It maybe a month or two or maybe a year or two.We have not tried rads for my mets yet so we don't even know if I will respond to rads.As for chemo we have tried and had little response.I had a chemo break of almost 3 months and had very little progression,we know that the older nodes are slow growing but now there are multiply little nodes and we don't know what they are going to do.I have heard many good stories about the use of gemzar/carbo but because I have had little response to the chemo's so far I don't know what to do.So please anyone with an opinion or with experience please,please chime in and let me hear what I need to hear.I just can't afford to make the wrong choice and with your help I'm confident I can make a decision I'm comfortable with.One minute I'm fine with having rads and the next I'm thinking chemo is better and then do the rads.I'm sorry if I sound so uneducated about this but I feel this choice needs to be explored to the fullest before I can make the right choice for me.Thank you all.........Dawn dx in 05 at age 29 with stage 2 grade 3 triple neg braca 1 pos bc...mets in Jan 07 to supraclavicular nodes Log in to post a reply",
