I was lucky that I had no symptons until the Pharmist wanted to see how much I could take, so she jacked up the dosage the 2nd round of Abraxane to see how long before I felt something, finally started to get tingling in my fingers so she had to dial it back. I even went on a road trip from North Carolina to Alabama to our Bowl Game with my sister between my third and fourth treatment of AC.  Being a control freak and it was my car I drove all the way, only problem was I didn't eat enough before going to the game so we ended up leaving in the 3rd quarter and went to get a Steak at the Sports Bar and finished watching the game there.  What I did was listen to my body, and lucky my work was flexiable, I didn't set an alarm just got up when my body said to and went to bed when it said.  Biggest thing was make sure I didn't cramp that was the big problem I had, gatorade and baked potates became my best friend.  Also kept foods like tuna, next to my bed, I would wake up starving a little bit of food and I was back out. ",

That cleared the way for a BMX which I got in Feb 09, and according to the biopsy my ONC surgeon did showed the Chemo was effective in killing the cancer in my breast and my lymph nodes only showed trace evdience of cancer.  After surgery I had 31 days of Radaition in July, my scans were still NED, started Abraxane again in August 09 till October 09 my scan's were still NED so I was granted a Chemo Break.  It is now 2012 and I am still on a Chemo break, during this time I was dx with an auto immune disorder called Sjogren's Syndrome bascially my Immune System is attacking mositure organs, mouth, eyes, skin, funny thing I had no side effects on Chemo except sinus infections, now I have to deal with the residual effects of the Chemo & Surgery aches and pains, severe dry mouth, burning dry eyes, fatigue.  Thank-fully it looks like after 2 years we have finally got them undercontrol. I am just glad to have the extrem fatigue under control.  It is still hard to get up in the morning and I have a crap load of pills (10) to deal with mainly the Sjogren's and for the pain, but no Chemo.  I get scanned or chest x-ray every 3 months and email my ONC if any thing knew starts up so she can decided what to do.  The doctor's think that the Sjogren's is some how keeping the cancer at bay.  I am still working full-time but I am not sure how much longer I can handle it becasue of the amount of time just this past month I have close to 100 hours overtime by December it could be in an excess of 500 considering most days are 10 hours and some can be 15 but it is a fun job where there is down time to rest some. ",

Alot of the SE to this is the same as some of the listed side effects of Chemo which we are managing with pain pills and muscle relaxers.  My doctors are scratching there collective heads because they can't explain why I have been NED for so long. There is a drug I can take to get rid of the majority of my symptoms but that would suppress the very confused immune system that seems to be denying the cancer cells  from dividing. ",

The Oncologist are have been theorizing that the Sjogren's is some how keeping the cancer under-control. To be honest for me fighting the cancer was allot easier since I had no side effects from all the chemo. Now I am not on Chemo and basically have all the side effects listed as side-effects of the Chemo's I took. After 2 years my immune system was still spiraling out of control, I was having extreme fatigue, swollen partoid glands, walking pneumonia, so my Oncologist approved me to start on Methoxrate. It helped some but not enough since April 2014 I have been going to the eye doctor every freaking month, I have had bacterial conjunctivitis every other month, inflammation of the cornea, also had a scratch on my cornea and about every other possible thing. I have no tears which means severely dry eyes to the point of Photo-phobia, my eyes are sensitive to light from indoor to outdoor, most of the times I have to wear shades. I have figured out that Predisnoe stops the inflammation of my eyes allowng me to go without the shades, but my Rheumatologist doesn't want to give it too me long term.. Even though almost everyone in my family has been taking it for decades. My oncologist agrees with me on the Prednisone but convincing my rheumatologist is another thing, i got a month's worth out of him for December, and the month has been great, I have energy, can go outside with no shades. But as I figured it has been almost a week off and my eyes are inflamed once more, and the fatigue is coming back with a vegenance.",

So there is some hope and we are currently testing the theroy of my immune system keeping the cancer at bay, my immune system is currently being suppressed for a month in an attempt to curve damaged to the joints in my hands.......",

I had agressive Chemo Abraxane (Stand Alone) followed by AC (red devil), surgery BMX, then Radation followed by Abraxane again but at a higher doseage, pharmist wanted to see who much I could take before having side effects didn't really have any except for a sinus infection.  By Jan 09 my first NED scan, making the docs more comfortable performing BMX, which was suppose to be followed by more Chemo, but I had an infection that hospitalized me so I was switched to Radation.  After Radation I went back on Chemo, scans where still NED.  Oct 2009 was my last Chemo. Mircacle? Not really when my immune system came back on it activated another inherited disease called Sjogren's Syndrome.  Bascially my immune system is attacking heathly cells in moisture making glands.  I have dry mouth, throat, nose, it is also attacking my joints, and it looks like its going after my digestive system right now, my ONC has sent me over to the GI Clinic.  Though I am not on chemo I basically have all the side effects and spend about $300 bucks a month on arthritis, pain pills, pill that is suppose to make salvia, and a drug used for Malaria that is suppose to help with the joint pain.  I get scanned every 3 months and any new issues I email my ONC. My Onc thinks the immune system is keeping the cancer in check, I was told that autoimmune disorders has been know to \"cure\" some cancer's like Melnomia but not breast cancer (my onc works with Melnomia cancer too).  I also read an article recently where doctors used a dead HIV virus into a child with Leukemia and it put her into remission, something about the T-cells. A 2nd hand story is that both my mom and aunt had breast cancer @ 29, my Aunt Stage IV, mom not sure cause she lied to the family only my dad knew it was cancer, she claimed it was beign.  I still want to know how much the boob job cost becasue you couldn't tell it was fake......Both would die in their 50's from Ovarian Cancer.",

I am taking wouldn't you guess an older chemo drug called Methotexate in a low dosage to keep my white blood counts low to curb the damage. Lately I have been sleeping more than awake but I have no pain which is important for me, not so cool part is I love the sun and beach but due to the Sjogren's those days are long gone. I am literally and figuratively allergic to the sun, LED lights which sucks since everyone and every place uses them, I have to wear sunglasses everywhere, cause lights hurt my eyes to the point of up chucking, I can also get burns from sun and some uv lights. Have to lower light on computer especially with white backgrounds like Word, Excel and this website. The dreaded 3 month return visit to the cancer hospital is fast approaching where I get to find out if my long unexpected ride with Mr. Ned has ended or my love affair will continue. Part of me would rather go back on chemo because no immune system means no more relentless attacks from my immune system. My joints, glands, eyes, muscles, mouth, skin, vein's, digestive system, kidneys, liver and well basically anything that is moisture making. Also have Fibromaligia, Raynauds, Varicose Veins, and other stuff that I can't remember. On a crazy amount of drugs all having possible interactions if mixed together it is a crazy cocktail we seemed to have got the right combo at the moment. My biggest issue is extreme fatigue, doesn't help that may cause drowsiness on all my drugs. I think I am up too like 6 Specialist Doctor's, the biggest pain is the doctor appointments, before I went on Disability from work I was only 20 minutes from the Cancer Hospital but now its 2 hrs away. They long trip takes all my energy from the entire month, which is how long it takes to recover from each trip.",

Chemo #1 Abraxane, Chemo #2 A/C, first NED scan, Surgery (Bilateral Mastectomy), Radiation, 2nd NED Scan,, Chemo #3 Abraxane again, Oct 2009 3rd NED scan. Doctors decided to give my body a break, and Grant me a Chemo break, I was told it would be short lived since I was Triple Negative, yeah it is 2015, the beginning of my 7th year with Stage IV. I was dx in the Summer of 2010 with an Autoimmune Disorder called Sjogren's Syndrome, Fibromaylgia, Raynauds which has been a royal pain in my ass, the doctors believe that it is some how keeping the Cancer under-control but it is a double edge sword. All moisture making glands, in my body are dead or dying my partoid glands are always swollen, I have little to no saliva, I have Severe dry eyes,which has caused me to have Photo-phobia, (my eyes when inflamed can't stand any kind of light I wear shades the majority of the time), I have no sweat glands so I have issues with regulating hot and cold, Extreme Fatigue, Swollen Joints, my skin allerigic to water and the list goes on. I have been on Methotrexate an old Chemo drug since 2012 in a low dose in an attempt to keep the Sjogren's under-control, I also have to take Plaquenil,Gabapentin, and a crap load more pills, I had been working Full time through Chemo until I was slammed with the Sjogren's, my body was like nope not happening, so I went on Long Term Disability from work which has helped allot, was able to move back home and reconnect with my extended family. That and having your EMT/Registered Nurse Cousin living right next door comes in handy and retired Aunts and Uncles that love driving you the 2 hours to then Cancer Hospital/rheumatology clinic/eye clinic every month comes in handy.

I was dx Stage IV out of the gate in 2008 with mets to liver and lungs. While my oncologist and rheumatologist tried to figure out if it was Lupus, Sjogren's or both, the dermatologist determined I was allergic to water and also had Psoriasis and Eczema, possibly Rosacea that was 2010. This month the eye doctor confirmed the Rosaeca due to the inflammation I have in my lower eye lids, I also have severe dry eyes and mouth. Also have Fibromalagia, Raynauds and about a dozen other things I lost track a long time ago. They actually think my Sjogren's is know somehow keeping my cancer under control, after I started my chemo break Oct 2009 the Sjogren's has spiraled out of control and the cancer has taken a back seat with NED. I am taking Plaquenil, Methotrexate, Minnocycline, Flexeril, folic acid, Gabapentin, nexium, exvoac, Restasis and a few others. They have been playing around with the doseage of Methotrexate we just recently up it. Looking over my medical history I have had the Sjogren's since I was a baby but it didn't really start acting up till I moved from rural North Carolina to the city. I spent the majority of my college career in student health with repeated bouts of Walking Pneumonia, Bronchitis, Sinus infections every month, when I would go home to the coast I didn't get sick. I just recently moved back to the coast and rural North Carolina which has helped tremendously with sinus and allergies. The bad thing is a 200 round trip 2 to 3 times a month to see my Specialist Doctors.",

My last Chemo treatment was Oct 2009, my last three scans had come back clean , so the doc's said I could have a break, I get scaned/x-ray every 3 months. I also was recently dx with Sjogren's Syndrome, currently waiting on results of my Bone Scan, to determine if the pain I have been having is Arthritis or Bone Mets.  The blood test came back good as well as my liver function test.",

Shortly after the chemo holiday started I was dx with Sjogren's Syndrome an autoimmune disorder, the doctor's think this may be helping to keep the cancer in check.",

My liver had over a dozen spots ranging from the size of a pin head to a quarter, My first round of chemo was with Abraxane that zapped all of them except the stubborn quarter size spot, and got all the spots in my lungs, the doctor's decided to throw another chemo AC at it then they plan was to go after the spot with Cyberknife. After finishing the AC I got my first NED Scan (no evidence of disease) so the cyberknife was canceled, I proceeded to have my double mastectomy then radiation to my left chest (where my primary tumor was) after that I had another round of Abraxane for the hell of it according to my Doctor. I was still NED after that round of Chemo and was given a break from Chemo that I was told was going to be short that was Oct 2009. Chemo Holiday has been a blessing although the battle with cancer was a trigger for another disease that for the most part had been doormat called Sjogren's (Auto Immune Disorder). I apparently I hit the genetic lottery of all the crappy genes in my family my mom's side a genetic defect Brac 1 and Ovarian, Breast and Bladder cancer and both sides of the family tree are littered with Auto Immune Disorders. The last year I have been taken low doses of Methotrexate which is an old chemo to treat the Sjogren's.",
