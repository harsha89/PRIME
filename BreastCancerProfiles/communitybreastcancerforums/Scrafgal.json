I had 6 months of chemo and just finished my third phase of reconstruction procedures. My hair came back after chemo but fell out again. I am now bald and without eyebrows--might grow back...might not...working with a dermatologist. But, despite my burden, I am truly happy. I do think that it has to do with the great support of friends and family and the fact that, other than being bald without brows (which is a big deal for me), I am healthy and was able to resume working fully. I just put on my makeup, create my brows, and walk out the door, understanding that a lot of people are dealing with a lot of things--not just me! Volunteering at a cancer hospital helps me keep perspective on things. This is a long road but you are not alone, regardless of your choice. However, you never know what joy life has in store for you. Your life today doesn't have to be your life tomorrow. I plan to make my next 52 years (or how many years I have), the very best ",

There us nothing positive about cancer and you need support right now. The women and men here will be here through your journey. Are you being treated at a major cancer center? If so, many provide other forms of support to address financial concerns and emotional support. I encourage you to seek out those resources if they are offered. Keep us posted.

I had a mastectomy, so I cannot comment about lumpectomy prep or recovery. When you know more about your type of surgery, then I could comment. I also saw you encouraging someone who just recently got diagnosed. You are awesome to support others, while you are still dealing with getting diagnosed. You are making a difference in the lives of others. Regarding your specific question about waiting, and the potential for spreading, you need to get additonal information about cell proliferation (e.g. Ki67%, Nottingham score). The more rapidly dividing are the cells, the more you don't want to wait. Also, if you are node negative, with high cell proliferation, it might make sense to have surgery sooner, if possilble.Take care",

Things will never be the same again, but I am happy m, working, and vacationing with friends and family. I hope that your radiologist is wrong but, if not, know that you are not alone. You can get through this. The beginning is just the hardest part. Blueberry...try to keep busy to pass the time but call after 1 week. They will have the results by then even if they have not contacted you. Get your PCP to call. That's what I did as I was waiting on Chrustmas Day and just after fir results. ",

I was motivated to find the actual regression formula: my oncotype score was 46. My ki67 was 90%, So, that was motivation enough to find it. I happen to be statistially trained and so when I brought the formula to my doctor he was shocked that I found it!",
