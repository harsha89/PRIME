The first time it went away on its own the second time doctors had given me antibiotics for a sinus infection and it slowly went away during. This time I felt pain in that area for a few weeks before I could actually feel the node. I had gotten a cold and still have sinus drainage (maybe sinusitis again) but i could feel the tenderness before i was sick. I seen my Doctor and she said if it's still there for a total of 4 weeks we will do a ultrasound and maybe biopsy. I have also noticed some tenderness to the side of my brest (same side as the swollen lymph) I can't feel any lumps though and wondered if it's also lymph nodes in that area. I only seem to notice it at night. I am in a panic the 4 weeks is up I have 2 small kids. I catch myself laying in bed crying of what would happen if something happened to me.
