They was afraid i was never going to walk if i didnt do it right away. In Jan we began innerthiecal chemo if methitrexate in my skull and abraxane thru my reg port. The cancer was not visable on my april mri. We finished at the end of may. In july it did show again so started my methatrxiate on mon and also havalin. THERE IS HOPE. I have came alot farther than they thought and can walk fine. Just a little clumsey sometime. LuAnn",

They say we are trying to by some time with this type of treatment then move on to another before chemo.  My tumor markers are 525 and were only 22 six months ago.  Is there any other women out there with the same thing that has happened to them.  I am thinking about a second oppinion also at MD Anderson.  I hear how eating a vegan diet also helps fight this and have even looked into vitamin c infusions.  I just dont know what to think or do at this point.  One minute you think you have just normal aches and pains or at least thats what the docor says and then your world just crashes down.  I guess I am just venting too but it is just too real at this point.  Anyone with any insight I would be glad to hear from.  I havent got on this web site for almost a year but it always seemed to help me cope by reading how we have all dealt with these horrible situations.
