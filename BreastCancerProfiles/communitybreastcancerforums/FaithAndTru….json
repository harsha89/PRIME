I had a wonderful counsellor who had actually had breast cancer herself so she helped me enormously. I cried so much in the first three months and I was filled with terror as my kids were only 8 and 11. I remember thinking I will NEVER be able to laugh again or see the funny side of anything and I love humour..but my counsellor told me my sense of humour come back and it has. You will find your way thru this and beyond it...believe it because it is true. You will even find great blessings along the way. I your counsellor is helping and also a lot of people find mindfulness helps a lot although I have not tried that ...yetðŸ˜ƒ Sending you a hug. X",

The high number of nodes involved really really terrified me I also had an area of 10 cm involved but made up of small tumours so i understand your fear but you will find something that helps you to manage that fear it just takes a bit of time.. I hope this helps. God bless.",
