I broke down in front of my little girl more than I care to admit. I prayed a ton. One silly thing that I told myself which may sound ridiculous but sort of helped me was that I wasn't really in any greater danger than I was every time I hopped on the freeway. (I live in Los Angeles.) I go back to the surgeon in the morning and am asking for bilateral mastectomy. I've got big plans with my sweet little munchkin and tatas aren't required. Good luck to us!",

Last night, after we left the doctor, she told me her left nipple has been hurting for 2 weeks. When I looked, I noticed a lump. Back to pediatrician This thread is very reassuring that there are so many similar stories - I am comforted that this is likely normal development. She started a new school this month and it aged her...my little girl that still likes to play \"aminals\" suddenly said she had her sights set on a boy and matured a year in a week. I suppose this is the beginning.",
