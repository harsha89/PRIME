She had two chemo treatments of taxotere and has been in the hospital for eight days now with pneumonia. The pneumonia has gotten worse and worse everyday until yesterday she was put in MICU on a vent. The dr last night told me they put her on the vent because it was becoming too much of a strain on her heart not being able to breathe. She said moms lungs are waterlogged but this might only be for a few days. They are taking another chest X-ray today to see if her lungs are getting any better. I was wondering if anyone has been through this and came out of it okay. I am so scared she looks so terrible.",
