I wish it were different; however, it's named and less scary now (if that makes sense). I have \"Invasive Ductal Carcinoma\". I see the breast surgeon on the 3rd to go through treatment options and get the remaining info (stage, grade, hormone receptors, etc). Hopedreams; ShellShell69: not sure where all of this went for you; I hope all of the best and that means that you were B9. Kangcongrl: I hope you don't have to wait too much longer to hear the outcome. I want to hear what's happening with you, please keep me posted. xo",

I\u2019m in Canada and unfamiliar with your health care system but I think nonomimi5 has given you some good guidance. Biopsy was alright; they took 6-7 samples as the first few weren\u2019t great. I have \u201cextremely dense breast tissue\u201d. The doc said it\u2019s more than likely that I\u2019m going to need surgery. There was only one very borderline lymph node, in really deep; he said he didn\u2019t feel it wasn\u2019t important enough to go after it. I read a post by DJMammo about lymph nodes (cortical thickness measurements) and the ultrasound report. I\u2019m going to review mine to make sure I have the information. My next appointment is with a surgeon, to review biopsy results and next steps. Guess I am part of the club no one really wants to be in :( Thank you for your support everyone.",
