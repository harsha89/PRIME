I had a fibroid adenoma and intraductal papilloma. Thank God...I was so stressed and was very thankful that everything came out ok. I was told to get dianostic mamm every year. I did this for 2 yrs and moved so it has been 2 yrs since my last mamm. I went March 6 and waited for them to read them then they did a spot compression and then a US. This is what they found... a focus of calcifications on mamm and then a single dilated duct on US. Birads 4.... radiologist wanted to do stereotatic biopsy but my dr wanted me to just go to surgeon. My appt is Apr 1st and I am trying really hard not to worry but it is so hard! I feel like no one understands the worry associated with this. I am living in Florida now and have no family here, just me and my 2 daughters...I actually feel ashamed to talk about this to my new friends because I fell like they will think that I am silly for being so worried. I know this sounds crazy but it goes back to my childhood and of feeling like I never had anyone to be there for me...you would think that at 38 I would be over this but I am not!!!  I was researching this and found this site and after reading ya'lls post I feel like I have found others who can relate to me. I really have a gut instinct that it is going to be cancer, but I had that feeling last time and everything was fine! I want to tell everyone who is going through this that I am praying for you and knowing that I am not alone has helped my worries somewhat! Thnaks Log in to post a reply",
