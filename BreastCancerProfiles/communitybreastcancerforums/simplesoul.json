Here I'm watching my exposure and he starts barfing for the first time in 5 years! I think my dexamethazone kept me kinda awake too, but I'm trying to stay relaxed. Just want it started so I can learn my response and get it over with .. Eventually. So amazing how different tx is for each person. It can really be scarey, but my onc said some things come down to md style (like high density, TAC vs act, etc). The research is good with so much of the big stuff but it's the tiny things that don't seem so fixed in stone. Good wishes to all the April gals out there! Take care!",

My white blood cells went hiding the first two times even with the neulasta and I got rehospitalized after tx 1 and had to hide away from my 5&6 yr olds the second time. Im still kicking the cold they gave me! Has anyone tried medical marijuana for nausea? I threw up the zofran this morning and I'm down to being really groggy on ativan or compazine. Thanks!",
