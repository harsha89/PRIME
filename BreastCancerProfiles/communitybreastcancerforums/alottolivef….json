I see her tomorrow but from what I have read it appears chemo will be part of the plan. I just turned 40 so I prefer to do everything I can to make sure I don't go through this again. I will post tomorrow after I find out!",

I see this as great news and am glad to move on with the rest of my reconstruction! Hope this helps anyone else looking for some input. I am being treated at one of the best centers in the country (Duke) so I am relying on their expertise.",
