      "Content": "michellej1980 wrote: Hi all, I was just curious about how long people typically wait after diagnosis to begin fighting BC. I was diagnosed 18th July and am looking at 19th September for mastectomy. I am having to wait longer because I am opting for immediate reconstruction and of course both breast and plastic surgeons need to be available on the same date. I'm just worried that two months is too long to let a known cancer continue to grow inside me. Now I have come to terms with the necessary treatment I've begun focussing on the real matter in hand - cancer. I'd originally been sent an appointment for a different plastic surgeon but after chatting with my haematologist (whose care I am under for previous Hodgkin's lymphoma) she recommended a particular female surgeon who she felt for one reason or another would be better for me, and I trust her judgement. The PS I met today was lovely and I really want her to do my DIEP flap. I don't think I can bear not having the recon immediately but is two months a long time to leave the cancer be? How soon after diagnosis did you ladies have surgery? Age at diagnosis: 31.
