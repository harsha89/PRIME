So, thank you everyone for contributing your stories and answering questions. I've found a great deal of helpful information that has made my decisions about treatment much easier. What I'd like to know, since I'm starting chemo soon, is what you wished you knew right before you started your own chemo that would have made it easier to deal with. You know what I mean? Things that made you go, Man, if only someone had told me about that before I started. Any and all suggestions would be incredibly appreciated!

      "Content": "May 8, 2011 08:36PM - edited May 8, 2011 08:36PM by jamiebeth Hey everyone! I'm having my first chemo treatment (Taxotere and Cytoxan) tomorrow. Your posts have encouraged me greatly, and given me some good ideas on how to cope. For those of you about to take dexamethasone to pre-medicate for Taxotere, it's not too bad. I was worried about taking it, but the side effects are very manageable. My appetite did not increase, and even though I was a little jittery, I was still able to take a two-hour nap this afternoon. Now that the steroids are a non-issue for me, I'm worried about the chemo infusion itself. I'm sure I'll get through it and come out of it no worse for wear except for some fraying around the edges, but still, that's some scary stuff.   Happy Mother's Day to all the moms on this board!
