All of my right lobe to the 2nd and third lobe was removed.  I originally started out with Stage 1, triple negative back on April 4th, 2008.  Don't ask me why, but my surgery didn't take place until 2 mos later in June. By that time when they were to remove one 3cm sized tumor, it had multiplied to two.  My Dr. had me come back in a week to remove the margins,  at that time I was told three nodes were removed, all were neg.  He told me they got it all!  I had a sectional mastectomy so their was a large section of surronding tissue removed.  It took two months for the incision to heal. The original incision broke open, my wound was exposed to bacteria for almost two months. Eventually after finding a good surgeon, it was treated, restitched and healed well. January, 2010 I had a CT scan that revealed a 3cm tumor near the center of the liver.  Dr. started me on a round of chemo. After 6 treatments I had another CT scan tumor was not responding and had grown.  My oncologist decided on Zeloda and Avastin, I was on both for several months.  The next CT scan showed the tumor had completely disappeared.  I was sent to the Surgical oncology specialist that would perform my surgery.  At that time I was told I had a fatty liver that could determine how much liver could be removed.  While I recouperated from my chemo to regain my strength before surgery, the Dr. and I met several times to discuss how much liver would be removed. He was concerned about what could happen if the residual liver wasn't healthy enough for the new liver to regenerate.  It was a risk I wanted to take and he felt comfortable enough to go through with the surgery. I had a rough recovery, close to a year before I even began to feel like myself.  It will be 2 yrs in two days that I will be in remission.  I recently had another CT scan. What was in the report has me somewhat worried.  Its funny how radiologist type all the findings in the body of the report but in the final impression they leave them out..Whats with that? But here are my concerns that were mentioned in the report, if anyone can relate to them please let me know.   On a recent CT scan it show some changes taking place. The scan say's the lateral segment of the left lobe and caudate lobe are hypertrophied. Nonspecific hypodensity within segment 2 at hepatic dome. Intrahepatic ducts remain normal, however, extrahepatic duct is dilated 8mm within the pancreatic head.  My concern is, because blood test CEA and CA 27-29 are not reliable and are nonspecific, could I possibly be at risk for metastisis to the pancreas or could it be sludge blocking the duct. As for the nonspecifity to the hypodensity of the left dome, could these be new cancer cells developing that are not registering in the  blood test?",

TN has a strong tendency to multiply, and also has a greater chance of mets to develop.",

That could have been another reason they decided on the surgery, I don't tolerate it well.  Best of luck to you, I pray that it never returns and that your doctors can keep it under control!",

I am on disability right now, it isn't because I had cancer it's a multiple of reasons.  I had to go back to work, only working 8 hrs. a week due to finanacial issues. Now I am  going to review to see if I am capable of working full time. The ins. I have is medicare and medicade, they paid for the surgery and all my test following.  I am fortunate and thankful!  I don't know that I am capable of full time employment, especially because I have so many other health problems. I'm sorry to hear of your brain mets..Good luck and may god bless you! Joanie",

I do have a ventral hernia as a result of the surgery that needs to be taken care of. Do you happen to have an enlarged abdomen?  Mine is so distended!  Im sure the hernia has something to do with it, however, I have alot of discomfort under my breast on the liver side.  It's not only distended but tight and it bulges out just under my breast as if Im pregnant. I feel full all the time I really hope that they can help you out with the mets!   ",
