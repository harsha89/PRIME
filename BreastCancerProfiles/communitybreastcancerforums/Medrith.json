I was concerned about her going to the radiologist without my being there but these questions definately get to the core and I will share them with her.  She is of the generration tho that doesn't question much....PLUS I loved your quote about Worry...it truly is a misuse of the imgination... I am most concerned about the side effects and whether or not she will be strong enough ...any thoughts?",

I would definately go to a cancer center or one that specializes in breast if possible.  I had a situation where the doctors at a tumor board meeting were arguing over what the pathology of the biopsy was.....turns out it was cancer, not viral cells as one doc thought.  You can just request the slides from the institution and the scans.  These are actually your property and you can request them at any time.  I actually picked up the pathology slides and hand delivered them to another cancer center. Thank God.",

Hair dryer on cool setting is a great way to dry like cathy said. apply thin layer of silvadene cream ( this is what is used for burn units) and just cover with the telfa ( brand name) but a non adhering bandage. you could use paper tape to hold in place if unable to wear a bra.  If it starts looking really yucky show your doctor/nurse but the cream is an antimicrobial burn cream. Unless you are having lots of drainage you should not have to change more than 1x/day. the less you bother \"the wound\", your burn, the more chance new cells have to form.  Hope that helps ",
