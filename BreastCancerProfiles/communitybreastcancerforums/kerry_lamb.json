A big, wide-sided bra was also the go..the pressure was very effective. I was active, like you. I have pretty much worked right through, and I think now that I'm just about fully healed, I can see that staying active has been a great benefit to shoulder mobility (which is just about 100%). It WILL get better!",

Going through the wig-choosing thing has been the toughest part of this whole unwelcome adventure, so I hope my experience will help you. I found a service called 'Wigsonwheels' (I am in Australia), and they came to my house. Maybe there is a mobile wig service near you? The girl was amazing. She was here for over 2 hrs. I also have really thick hair, and curly, and I didn't have a hope of getting anything like my style. They were all like Dallas hair-do-s.. so I ended up choosing a straight one exactly the same colour as my own. It was almost impossible to get it on over my mane, so I just had to trust the girl. I buzz-cut my hair and just started wearing the wig before my hair fell out (3 weeks after chemo 1). It was my smartest decision.I felt invincible because I had taken the control. The colour-matching is really important. People just thought I had straightened my hair. AND it made me look heaps younger  You get used to it, and even though I really dislike having to wear it, I am grateful to have it. Mine is a 'Jon Renou', and it cost me AUD $340, so it would cost you about the same, I guess. It's a good wig, and easy to take care of. I am a high school teacher so I am under intense scrutiny from my girl-students all the time. They have been amazed at the wig; they cannot believe it is not real. So there you go! If you can fool the harshest critics, you will be ok! Before I called wigsonwheels, I corresponded with an online crew called 'Savvy Sheitels' and they were lovely. Have a look at their site. I found it impossible to decide because there are so many sites, but they were great.  Good luck with your choice, and don't worry! All this will be over before you know it. We are all much stronger than we know! ",

No, this is not a girl's own forum!  I suppose all women are different and most of the time we confuse the hell out of our poor partners. I can only tell you what works for me. I need my man to be close: lots of big, long, strong hugs. Lots of 'I'm here' closeness in the bed. He thinks I am beautiful and he tells me often. Who would argue with that?? I also love how he will just do household jobs that I usually do. It gladdens my heart to see him walk through the room with a big pile of wet towels to hang out, or struggling in with the groceries. If the weather is good (rare in Tasmania atm!) and I suggest a walk, he is always enthusiastic, even though he would not normally be. He speaks to my family to chat with them about my progress..not something I enjoy doing. He manages to always be there during chemo. I'd be fine on my own, but I love him sitting there reading. I love it that he is fully educated on the drugs, stages etc etc and does not have to discuss the minute details with me. (I don't want to know about it..I just want to get on with it.) I like him to tell me quietly before I go to sleep that he is always there for me. It's hard to get your head around the exhaustion when you are not going through it yourself..so you must become a very good actor and very patient! The fatigue is all-encompassing, especially in the first week after chemo.  I don't know if other girls feel like me, but I believe it is extremely important to 'live in the moment'. I don't want to deal with anything too far into the future..so the 'You will make it through this' is kind of redundant to me, as is \"It is going to be alright'. But the moment-to-moment stuff is really important. (eg \"You are my girl\" or \"Here is your cup of tea\".  ) It's funny, you know. No-one is prepared for this at all. But somehow, when you start, you both find all kinds of strengths. I am lucky, because I come from a strong family whose motto, if we had one, would be  : \"You are alive. What's to sook about?\". I do, however, empathize with those who are made of different stuff.  Love is it. In the words of our brilliant and slightly off-centre poet, Michael Leunig: \"Love one another, and you will be happy. It's as easy, and as difficult , as that.\" ",

I am telling y'all this because our group (20 of us) met exactly 2 years ago on this site when we all started chemo for the fecker breast cancer. Two years! Who could believe?? My love and prayers (and plenty of curses!) to all of you braving this treatment. I am here to tell you some things you all will want to know: the 'come down' from the steroids is she-it, your hair grows back like mad, your eyebrows grow back before you know it, drinking 8 glasses of water a day will change your chemo-life, (as will walking 3 miles a day), you will be utterly fecking fatigued for 15 months after you finish BUT get this: it FLIES by!! and you will 'catch yourself' feeling good. Top tips for dealing woith FEC (especially followed by TAX) : 1) drink water as though it is the secret to immortality (I had to have mine with gatorade powder, even though I LOVE water) 2) Don't fret about the steroid-induced 'wired' period following chemo.Use it to think about things and solve problems. I used it to my advantage ie I designed a beach shack. (which i have since built with my bare hands!). 3) Use the Biotin toothpaste and mouthwash even though you have no symptoms. Be warned! 4) Use slippery elm bark powder. (I am not a hippie freak!) It will sooth those inflamed mucous membranes (from your mouth to your..you know..) and finally...(oh how I wish someone had told me this!!) 5) Use a greasy barrier cream on your girly nethers. I used a beeswax hand-salve BEFORE the symptoms arose. Man..I was NOT prepare for THAT. You are all champions..and this c-rap comes to a surprisingly fast end. I CANNOT WAIT to meet the girls on Thursday..the ones who helped me get to this glorious day :) Thank God for this site",

I have been really studying this fatigue thing all year (since my near-death adventure in Feb.) and have come up with two things (thyroid, anemia etc excluded). Firstly, pain wears me out. I can be feeling great, but if I get 2 or 3 days relentless pain (even if I seem to be sleeping), I crash. I can hardly move. The other, much more interesting, thing is about oxygen and its uptake. When I am breathless with low red blood cell count (nadir) the fatigue is ridiculous. This was the case when I was recovering from ARDS, before bc diagnosis. It was always the case when I used to smoke. I too (even in my 20s!) used to have a nap in the car. I was actually famous for my nana-naps of 2 hours! The ONLY thing that works for me is to get oxygen into the bloodstream. I really think super-fitness is the answer..(N-o-o-o-o-o!  I'm 50!!!) That's so hard when we have NO energy, but I think we have all discovered that the docs just don't get it. Even when, in desperation, I have sat and said, \"You don't seem to understand. I am too tired to breathe.\", I just get, \"Oh...\" And that's all! My plan for post Sept 26th is to get a professional recovery + stamina exercise regime drawn up and adopt it for the rest of my life. What option do we really have? Death has tapped us on the shoulder, and I'm going to run as fast as I can! (literally) ",

My 71 yo stepmuminlaw recently had an xray for excruciating pain in her knee. When her doc viewed the pictures (before referring her to a specialist) he told her to be fully prepared for a diagnosis of SECONDARY cancer.She was absolutely gutted.  She then had to wait 3 weeks (thinking she had advanced cancer) to see the specialist and have CT scans and MRIs. She had bad arthritis and ostop to that precise area and has since had a very successful knee-recon. AnnaB, this waiting thing (with al the what-ifs) is, believe it or not, the worst part. If you are diagnosed you will morph into a warrior that you could never have imagined. I can hardly even remember the diagnosis. My last 9 months have been a blur of tests, surgery, chemo, work and more of all that, and now IT IS OVER and I am feeling normal again (albeit with a different hair-do and funny brows and lashes). Its seems like a movie I watched. This site pushed and pulled me through the whole thing. XXXXXXXX ",

It's all good.  I'm seriously hoping that there is a direct correlation between hair loss and weight gain ie as my hair grows back, my Queen Mary-style arse will reduce and disappear.   Today I was trying to mascara-up my 5 eyelashes and when I (forgetfully) tried to pick off a lump  (grrrrr AND it is brand new mascara grrrr) I pulled the lash out.

This is significant because I had not plucked my eyebrows for 25 years. I kid you not. I grew twice as many. It is wonderful.

The point I am making is..just when it all seems insurmountable..everything starts to grow again. It happens in a flash. The hair on my head is about 2 cms long and that whitish baby fluff that was there for a while is now being outgrown by dark hair.

I had tried all the baby-barrier creams. I made my cream with (roughly) 1 tsp of pure beeswax (hardware store?) and 3 tsp of olive oil. Put it in a small microwaveable container (glass or ceramic only) and heat on med high until the beeswax just starts to melt..do it SLOWLY...30 secs at a time. Stop when there are still some flakes of beeswax in there..overheating is not good. Stir with a little fork (plastic is fine) quickly until it starts to go a bit milky and then quickly add one drop of lavender oil and keep stirring until it is fully mixed. I put the lavender in to stop bacteria growing, but you could use a vitamin E cap pierced and squeezed in. You can leave it in the container 'for the duration', then throw it out if you wish.  It is great for sore lips as well, but no double dipping! (And external use only) Hang in there! XXX ",

I actually had some adenomas removed when I was 25. I am now 50. I always had some scar tissue there and some lumpiness on the same site and had regular mammos. Long story short, last year (after a negative needle biopsy!) my surgeon decided to take the lump out because she didn't like anything about it, despite the negative result. It was cancer and on we went from there. I think most doctors would prefer to remove lumps just to be on the safe side, and for your own peace of mind perhaps you should have it out. A lumpectomy is a pretty good investment in your own health, mental and emotional health especially. Breast cancer is shite, and best avoided!",

I do, however, still enjoy playing the cancer-card. Well hell! I EARNED that card! On Thursday afternoons I have a watercolour painting class..paid for by my school. (Cool!) Last Thursday I was early and had my wig on and the teacher was admiring my 'hair'. I went into the full explanation and she was suitably concerned/worried/impressed/affirming..all the things I was seeking! Anyway, part-way through the class I had to duck out to buy a different brush. When I came back the whole class (all older, retired gentle-folk) were fussing and cooing, and rubbing my back..NONE of them mentioned cancer!..and being so lovely! I loved it! And on the Wednesday I was walking around at school doing yard-duty, bin in hand; as I approached the 14/15yo boys they all got up to fly away leaving their rubbish everywhere. I called out to them \"That's right! run away! leave it to Cancer Girl to pick up! No..no..I'll be fine!\"  What is that??? This isn't permanent is it?? RanD???Are you (relatively) ok???

Afterwards I made him go through the utensil draw, which he reduced by 2/3 (I shit you not!) and two other draws. He tossed a whole lot of very ugly table linen (do I seem like a table-linen kind of a girl??) from when She Who Must Be Obeyed left 6 years ago. (I've been here 3, in case you are wondering..) It was so cool. This is a man who will part with NOTHING. (It's an illness..) But after all of that I had no heart for the wardrobes. I do today though..m-w-a-a-h-h-a-a-h-h-a-a-a-h-h-a-a-a!!   (He's at work). ",

I almost could not stand up properly. But, as always, and with all y'all support, I have a plan and I'm going to turn this shit around when I recover from this next cut & shut (tomorrow).

Lorna is the doll-maker, and I had bought her a couple of things at the auction-house to make clothes out of. The rules are very strict..natural fabrics only etc etc. I had bought her a heavily pintucked and broderie-trimmed long cotton dress, made in Mexico, a very nice old fur 'shrug' (embroidered silk-lined) and an old lacy cotton christening gown. All for AUD$65. Well, she was beside herself. The christening gown is 150 years old! Apparently these things can be accurately dated. There is enough very decorative fabric in the Mexican voile dress to make about 50 exquisite petticoats for dolls. James very much enjoyed the visit (wasn't too bored) and we had a lot of laughs. Driving was a bit tricky..I cursed the sloshing seroma every time I hit a bumpy bit of road. I'm looking forward to getting the thing drained again on Wednesday. Roxi, C-Rap! about the infection..C-Rap to drains in general, actually. Jeano, you are a machine!!  Rock, exercise (with all the associated resentment, negative self-talk and excuse-making) is a gift. And I say this as the queen of finding reasons not to do any.

Did he think he was doing the grande tour with you guys?? Not so funny the little bastards trying to hit the bird. I just remembered..I intervened in a similar situation last year..involving plovers. I got all high and mighty and marched myself along to the kids I had been observing (I thought) trying to find and take the chicks. I scared the hell out of them just with my body language. Turns out they were VERY distressed and worried about the possiblity of the chicks being run over beside the incredibly busy road! They asked for my help to save these chicks! I (red-faced) explained that the plovers chose that spot because no humans or dogs ever walked there..too close to the cars rushing along. They were so relieved and grateful. And I felt like a mean old bitch. Later I blamed chemo...XXX to you all. I'm off to turn the electric blanket on..yep, despite the GET BACK!! flashes. Frost here tonight.",

We are building these two corrugated gal 'shacks' (I think you guys call them cabins) at the estuary at Bellingham so that our families will have a debt-free, beautiful holiday location..like in the old, old days. It's so cool to think of extended families staying there in years to come: the elders will have the 'good' house with the ensuite bathroom, the younger couples will have the fold-out sofas, the teenagers will have the shed with the sleeping platform and the little kids will have the tents. That's my dream, anyway. I'll be watching it on a kind of cosmic closed-circuit TV. I also hear what you're saying about the port/up periscope biz. I was very brave about blood draws etc but when the end was in site I felt as though I had only a precise (small) number of needle-sticks left in my tolerance-quota. The up-periscope is very quick..it COULD wait, but can you get the two-for-one deal? ie the port used for the up-periscope and then the port removed whilst you are under?

There is no understanding to be done. In 1975, in Australia, the Family Law Act changed (to No Fault Divorce) and the earth shifted on its axis. Few ever (honestly) doubted a person's right to marry & divorce whomsoever he/she pleased...even though culturally the changes took some adjusting to. But I started teaching in 1979, 4 years after the new Act. It was when the first wave of separated families started showing up in class. I have been teaching broken-hearted children for 31 years! It is not possible to measure the impact of end-of-family. I have learned a couple of things, though Cris. Children who feel secure (Are you still my Mom? Will I have a bed? Does Daddy still love me? Will we have a house? Can I take my fish?) do best, as do those who see both parents liberally and without 'seething' handovers! You know what? This cancer biz has prepared you (and all of us) for any old shite life throws up from here on. We know shite from clay. We know our a$$ from our elbow. We know love when it's looking at us.

Who's is that?' and then remembering it is one of my prized possessions. I actually can't work out if it's chemo-brain or don't-give-a-rat's-ass-factor. Anyway, it makes for exciting house-decorating..better than shopping.  The exquisite pleasure of purchasing the new ironing-board cover ( yeah..I KNEW ya'all would be envious) was short lived. I tried to buy a new shower-curtain. I was gutted. Have you SEEN the shite that is around??? I was worn out from trying. (And I am a May O'Eight girl! ROFL) Anyway, we are LOVING living here and I am slowly getting over the Exhaustion That Dare Not Speaketh Its Name. My hair has grown long enough for me to go topless (though not to school just yet) and my eyebrows! OMG my eyebrows! I am plucking them! My David Bowie c1983 look is no more! I have been very amused at the Up Periscope talk. Is anyone else feeling like I am: the lady-of-a-certain-age-medical-bloody-fecking-tests-and-concerns-nothing-better-to-talk-about kind of girl?

She was a VERY difficult woman and yes, did that blaming/health competition thing ALL MY LIFE. She was an alcoholic and made my Dad's life so hard, but she blamed ME (loudly and daily) for 'ruining their relationship'.  Despite all that shite, I learned a thing or two about tenacity from her. She even died with her eyes half open (..\"defiant to the end\" was how my Dad described it.)

My surgeon said 4 - 6 weeks off work and I went back in two. (My family are very matter-of-fact in the recovery dept!) It really does depend on what you do for a job. Looking back I don't think a double would be harder to manage than a single..but my surgeon does not send patients home with drains attached. I went back to her rooms and had the seroma aspirated about twice a week. The two MOST important things are not overstretching in any way, and yet keeping the shoulder etc mobile. The healing only happens ONCE and you want to have full mobility in that whole area for your good long life! You stretch things as you can manage. Forget obvious things, like hanging washing and lifting babies/bags of shopping. But you can still cook and fiddle about in the kitchen. Once the wound heals, massage it with something plain..maybe a pierced vitamin E capsule. My surgeon, who is a brilliant little girl thing, was quite definite when I talked about immediate re-con. (I had read that masses of girls do it at the same time). She told me to wait 12 months for a myriad of reasons, not least of which is: exactly how much physical and mental trauma can we take exactly? I now know she was right. I'm going to feel like a rich (older) Hollywood starlet fronting up next May (emotionally healed, fit and on fire) , rather than a scared, scarred freaked-out amputee who wants her 'femininity' back.

Brows...much paler looking, but I can see black dots (new hairs trying to grow). Legs..s-m-o-o-o-o-t-h, Mound of Venus: VERY tidy. Head: baby fluff all over and ONE hair left from the buzz-cut. It's my lucky hair. I'm checking out a new wig this week because we are in spring here and I cannot imagine wearing my current Jackie O-looking thing in our 30 - 40 degree summer. (Not in Tas which gets to about 30, but in Victoria where my family lives). I'm feeling VERY fine about my last poisoning on Friday. (Have I mentioned it once or twice??) My husband is the marathon runner falling over the line..I have to take special care of him atm..To use his words, it's been a big year.

A few cells outside one lymph node, with clear margins, no signs anywhere else in my body and 16 weeks of dating the Chief Poisoner do not a Stage IV make. I'll be sent off for PET scan in Melbourne, hopefully when my hub and I are on our celebration junket there late November, so I guess I'll know then. Get this: Tasmania has owned a PET scanner for about 18 months but the state government has been involved in a snap and snarl about whether or not it goes into the Hobart public hospital or into a private one. Meanwhile, patients fly interstate..IF they're able to travel. Gr-r-r-r. The big news is I start my diet/exercise battle (bigger than BC!!) today (after I get off the couch) . I don't care how tired I am..I don't care how beautiful the champagne is that Drew has made..I DO NOT want a re-run of this year. Rock, I'm sorry for your friend's death. I struggle to get my head around the loss of young people. It really does comes down to this: The way he died is irrelevant. The way he lived is everything. Starting the Fair Trade biz...WOW. Makes us think, doesn't it...? I had a amazing boy in my tutor group at school five years ago. He impacted on EVERYONE he interacted with. No-one doubted he would be College Captain (BIG). But he left to what he loved: building. When he was 18, he knocked off work one day, boarded the light plane with three others to fly across a little strip of water home. The plane took off and immediately crashed into the sea, killing all on board. I have a photocopy of the last words he ever wrote (at a camp the weekend before he died): Live life, and Love. Love life, and LIVE. When I make my big fat (50th birthday) gold ring, I'm having it engraved with those words to remind me why we are really here.  I too really feel for those of ya'll who are struggling financially. We were devastated last Nov when my hub was made redundant (by J&J!!) but there was the (unknown-at-the-time) benefit of the redundancy payout we paid out the credit cards and paid all our rates in advance and fixed up the house a bit. All that gave us some breathing space for this year when my teaching hours were unexpectedly reduced and the medical out-of-pockets rolled in. There was no way we could have survived otherwise. And Drew started his new job (with no-questions asked carer's leave) on the day of my mastectomy! Never an ordinary day have I lived..... XXXKerry ",

It's like the 2nd last one is the significant one for me..I'm in a different head-space for the last one. I'm crossing cancer off my list of things to do.

Tonight I'm in bed with a bloated, painful stomach, a head which has just melted off my neck and onto the pillow, a neck which is so cold it has frozen into an odd shape, legs which I would swear were made of lead if they didn't have so many fecking shooting pains in them, pinched nerves in my spine from my enormous prosth, and a mouth made of milky white shite and ulcers. My husband is away tonight so I'm sitting here bare-chested and sweating, getting a good old squiz at the M-site. Does the tax really cause all this heat? WTF? I don't want to do anything..although today I did sew a hook-and-eye on a skirt I have been wearing for two years, which undoes every time I sit down because of the lack of hook/eye. This could be a good sign. I hung the bedding out today to blow in the spring wind..I am sure my whole house smells like a chemical factory. Tonight I'm kind of assembled on the (sheetless, unmade) bed as though I'm in a refugee camp. And yes, I'm sleeping this way tonight. I'm trying to find a way of making myself get out and get moving tomorrow (I am on two weeks 'holiday'..now there's a laugh!) but boy... What are you all thinking about Tamox etc after the chemo finishes? I'm so over chemicals I'm rethinking the whole thing. I'm desperate to feel 'normal', and I don't know that another 5 or 10 years of drugs is going to help me achieve that.  I want the drug that gives me motivation, with 'minimal side effects'. ",

Re my slang: 'Squizz' means to have a close look. It comes from something about Squizzy Taylor ( a petty crook given way too much attention in our early days here in Australia). I'll track down the source (in between searching for missing buttons to sew back on). 'Feck' and 'shite' are polite Irish  alternatives to.. well..you know..As a teacher and chaplain I can't use the real words in public so I have trained even my students to use these ones.

It is a sign of the fecked-up times we live in. I've been teaching for 29 years and boy have I seen a change or two. Sensible, compassionate people KNOW that with kids it is about two crucial things: 1. Learning how to lose in a competition regardless of how much effort is put in and 2. Never looking like the person who lost. It's up to adults to manipulate things so that real competition (with all it's obvious benefits and life-long lessons) is honoured, AND every child is affirmed and acknowledged even though they are not 'top dog'.  This is not rocket science. EVERY person who works with youngsters should be expert at this stuff. Too much formal acknowledgement is never enough when it comes to kids forming values.

I always laugh..(or cry, depending on how long after the dex it is..).  This is my informative post. Tasmania is so NOT a tropical island! I fell off my chair laughing at that. When I moved here my brothers were really, truly concerned that I was moving somewhere like Moscow! It is freezing in winter, very cool in spring, mild is summer (max of about 30C every now and then) and amazingly perfect in the long indian summer/autumn...Feb, Mar, April.  The island is very beautiful in parts and surprisingly ugly in parts. It's very small..two weeks is plenty of time to have the full Tasmanian experience. The East coast is brilliant for most of the year and really beautiful. I think most visitors from other continents would be surprised at how 'empty' our beaches are here, and a surprising number of Tasmanian families have a 'shack' at the beach. It's not that they are rich..the 'shacks' have been in families for years and years. Real estate prices have been very low for decades. Things have pretty much caught up to mainland Australia now. Spring temperatures are about 65F -75F, higher on the mainland. It's generally a green, hilly place and very unlike my 'country', which is flat and dry with a HUGE, black starry sky. Sigh.... Re my REAL near death experience: I'm philosophical about my cancer and some people think I am pretty unconcerned by it, and this is mostly true. I have my dark moments, believe me, but I remind myself that I nearly died for real in February; I'm too tough for cancer! (That's my self-talk, anyway.)  In about the third week of January I got sick and thought I had the flu. I've had it once in my life (in 1981!) and remember it in detail. I had all the same symptoms. I went to the doctor at one stage and he told me he had had quite a number of people presenting with the same symptoms: viral thing..bedrest and paracetamol, plenty of fluids. I stayed in bed getting more and more ill..temperature rising etc. On Jan 29 I told my husband I needed to go to the hospital. He took me back to the doctor (to bypass A & E). I have no memory of seeing the doctor! I was admitted, deteriorated and was then sent to ICU with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ie no ability to take up oxygen. I was intubated for 6 days..family was called from the mainland, priest was called. I was checking out. I, of course have no memory of this..induced coma! I had atypical pneumonia..no cause, no cure. At one stage I was on 100% oxygen and it wasn't enough. I still can't get my head around it. The staff at our hospital are absolute geniuses in my view. The head guy 'believed in his heart of hearts' that I would live..about 45% of ARDS patients survive. He told me that if I had stayed home I would have been dead in two hours. When someone goes down that quickly, they see the pneumonia as a smoke-screen for something else, and they found the (25 year old) lump and called the surgeon. She biopsied it..the lump bent the needle! That test was benign. She then pursued me (after I woke up!)  to have a lumpectomy because she just did not like anything about the lump, despite what my mammograms (which I have every 2 years), ultrasounds and the biopsy showed. Well..the rest is history. Mastectomy, axillary resection and 18 weeks of chemo later...I owe her my life. Her astuteness as a surgeon and breast specialist transcended all the tests..how cool is she??? So! Cancer??? BRING IT ON! My poor body, once strong (farmer's daughter) now has no muscle-tone, greatly reduced aerobic capacity..the whole disaster. I need one of those before and after TV shows to take me on as a special subject! But, I remind myself that when I 'woke up' I could not grasp a tissue AND pull it out of the box. I had to learn to walk again. THEN I had to learn to walk with shoes on my feet! And all of that after only 6 days asleep. When you girls are exhausted and feel as though you could 'sleep for a week', be careful what you wish for......... Much loveXXXKerry ",

The dog's name is Phoebe and I'm not sure an Australian farmer's daughter is allowed to have a dog called...Phoebe.  Quick! What sounds like Phoebe? My husband's only suggestion is 'Fleabag'. My Facebook idea (May O'Eight) was one of those good-ideas-at-the-time, but with the benefit of a small amount of hindsight, I think normal Facebook pages are much easier than a separate one (May). We'll see how we go. I like signing on here, and the cancer-connection is hardly one we can ignore. Jen, I am freaked out by the poss of Lymphodema. Y'all will probably NOT believe this but I am more freaked out by the possibility of developing IT than I am about recurrence. I think it's because there is no cure..there is no 'fight'. There is only a debilitating condition, and for someone like me who is a rural/feral lass and who likes physical, blokey activities, the thought of not being able to do ANYTHING I DAMNED WELL PLEASE freaks me. I'm not nursing my arm, but I am being aware and feck it! sensible. I tend to cuts (before bc my arm could rot off...I wouldn't notice..) and do a lot of gentle stretching and rotations. I'm getting good info off the L thread. One big worry is flying..although real research doesn't show it, there's a wealth of anecdotal evidence that a flight commonly kicks it off. It will make a 'catch up' in the US tricky..but hey! if I have to have lots of fancy stopovers...who can complain?? Randy! Randy!

I put up with it during the day (and my family put up with me) but I took the ibup at night. Watch out for acid-glass-shard-gut too.

Now, I know his wife has a thing for hoarding so I never worry about his visits. But yesterday I could see him very discreetly stealing looks around my living area. Then..you know how you focus a camera on something?? My domestic vision came into focus. Oh the horror. Have I really been THAT off the job? Admittedly, the fridge-pulled-out made it look worse. (I was cleaning behind it.) (Don't look alarmed, girls, the repair man was coming). But wow! what a neglected bomb-site. Sad, sad antitoot.

We are into the the spring/summer music festival season...I'm kind of over that scene by about 25 years and I'm VERY over the drugs that go with it now that I know a thing or two about REAL drugs! I'm fascinated by the festival names over there: Yambouree, Noonday Onion!! Did any of you read Bill Bryson's 'walking tour' of England before he returned to the US for good? I actually laughed out loud through the whole thing, but it was the chapter listing the names of places that made me pee myself. Earlier this year I read 'That Ole Ace in the Hole', (Annie Proulx) and really enjoyed the Texan pictures and sounds I got in my head as I read it. As a result of being a May O'Eight,for the first time in my life I'm getting interested in bits of the US, and Texas is one of them..perhaps because where I come from it's so big and flat and rural (I am guessing that Texas is flat..pardon my ignorance of these important details!) Lewing, I am so impressed by your running biz. I dream about SOME level of fitness..walking the dog (Phoebe, Freebie, Heebie-Jeebie, Fleabag, Feeble...any more helpful name-suggestions?..I'm calling her Reebie which will morph into Ruby by Wednesday) twice a day will start that long hard road!

The only cancer-stuff I have been thinking is about getting over to Melbourne for a PET scan asap and put the fecker out of its misery. Today I got further on with my life: I washed my chemo-bedding FOR THE LAST TIME, I bought hideously expensive and hideously wanky (not manky) capri Skins (I swore I NEVER would, but nothing else offered the compression on these sad legs)..and I'm getting on the bike tomorrow to have a little ride. I had a little practice the other day and could not find the brakes. Noelle..when did they put the brakes on the handle-bars...?   I also visited a lady who breeds Manchester Terriers. (I've decided to get one..first dog in 14 years after a lifetime of dogs) only to find out they cost  800 quid!! WTF!!!   BUT! she has some 6 yo bitches she wants to rehome so-o-o-o $800 or free?......$800 or free?  Let me think now... I also bought 3 pairs of 2nd hand french doors for our soon-to-be-built shack  (for a bargain, unlike the bf Man Ters) and now I'm simply exhausted from hoping my house sale settles next week. E-e-e-ek if it doesn't! AND THEN I came home and washed my youngest step's head-licey bedding. Yep, James has nits. Tres embarrasseeng!  Ok, while I'm still wired, and before I get really neulastery, I'm going to try to upload some Skins of a different variety. And Noelle!

Update on getting on with my life: Near our house there is a place where someone is doing renovations and there has been a little timber staircase on the side path for a week..couldn't see it very well, but it looked like something that might go up to a bunk. After I picked James up from school (he with with his nits, me reeking of chemo) I remembered that fortune favours the bold, so I stopped at the house. The owner was in the yard and was DELIGHTED that I would take the steps. But get this! They are a stunning set of 2\" thick perfect, shiny hardwood stairs that run between two house floors. They LAUGH at bunk steps HA HA! I simply cannot believe my luck.  Another stair story. I bought a stair at a real redneck auction a couple of years back (yes..I like a stair) and was driving a 1984 Honda Civic at the time, so I paid the last illegal poacher in Tasmania one rare rabbit trap to deliver it to my house!  Only in Tascrazier....or maybe Canada as well.

Are there two sweeter words in the English language???I am getting misty for you XXXX Thank God.  Cris & Otter, I had almost EXACTLY the same thought process as you..concentrate..take notes..ask questions...maintain control..this is important.  I had the lump for 25 years (scar tissue on lumpectomy site) and had a mamm every two years. When I had the Big Drama last Feb, the docs started looking for reasons why I crashed and burned so swiftly. They biopsied the lump (it bent the needle) and it was negative. The breast surgeon was not satisfied, didn't like anything about it (even though the mamms had shown no change) etc etc etc and she wanted to take the lump out, which she did. My clearest memory (in the complete blur) is her coming to the waiting room to call me. Drew stood up as well and I said, \"No need to come. Just wait here\". She said, \"You come too, Drew.\" That was when I knew and astonishingly I went completely numb. We sat down and she said,\"The lump is cancer\". I could see Drew out the corner of my eye and I watched his whole persona ripple and shudder and kind of collapse. I couldn't look at him because I would have just lost it. I don't remember any dates and I have no interest in marking The Occasion. In fact, almost every day I feel as though I dreamt this whole mess. I get so much strength and peace from you girls, and so much big love from my man. And my faith envelopes me as well. I don't know why, but I never think \"It might come back\". Blind optimism? Maybe. But like Eddie I truly feel that we are all going to be around for a long, long time. Eddie, I laughed out loud at the 44444 thing, and your brother telling you that you are not a Chinese family! That was hilarious. Nothing else was, mind you. I just hate it that any of you have to suffer one iota.  Noelle, I want you to blow business out of the water. I want you to hit paydirt and to come up with something so exhiliaratingly fantastic that it gets mega press. I hope Oprah hears about it. Actually, have it ready for when we go on the show!!! Anyone happen to have her email address??  I'm going to bed early tonight. Last night at 8 o'clock I decided to have a cup of tea and hop into bed. Or get out some Nick Cave music dvds, drink a bottle of champagne and go to bed at 11.30. Hmmmm. How to choose...Let's just say I was hunting for the headache tablets at 4am!!! Love y'all.

It's all true..I just hate having to face up to it every now and then. Rock, I'm with you on the cure thing...to me, sending money off and demanding a cure is a mad expenditure; so many families would benefit in REAL, HERE and NOW terms from some financial help, some relationship counseling, and opportunities to experience peace and help and love. Cancer has taught me (as mentioned by Rock) to value what I have in this minute and to DO things. I have regrets about Randie; I regret that I didn't get around to sending her a special, beautiful rock I found at the beach near our block. I regret not letting my ears prick up far enough when her hub added me on FB. I think that was the week they knew what the real prognosis was likely to be.    I can't do much about a contribution from Australia, although I should be able to send an international money order to whoever will shout my part of the cost. Please..nothing pink for Randie. I have had so many laughs thanks to her..but I seem to remember the biggest belly-laughs coming when I read her no-holds-barred reactions to the pink biz last October. I believe I actually cried laughing. So no pink. Red carnations? A cheque for the family to spend on a meal out together, or on a big tank of fuel for a road-trip to a special place?  Please, please let me know so I can pay my share. I'll work it out. I'm posting a link here to a clip on YouYube. It's a cool tune by a couple of Australians. I found Randie to be really laconic, like a proper Australianand this clip is perfect.

I have been thinking back to my end-of-chemo, which was Sept 26 last year and this jumped into my head: 'I should have been a pair of ragged claws, scuttling across the floors of silent seas'. That's how I felt..I WAS those ragged claws. I can't believe you love that poem..how cool! And how cool is everyone's news..that is so nice for a change. It's Fathers Day here, and it's been a really nice day at our place. I even made pavlova for dessert, with whipped cream, green and yellow kiwi-fruit, strawberries and a starfruit. James (13) showed Alex (16) the end of the starfruit and said,\"Looks just like a star!\". Alex, in classic grumpy 16yo style replied, \"Looks just like an a$$hole\". James nearly peed himself laughing..rather than being really rude, it has become really funny. For example, when the Ginger Ninja was licking his..you know..James said, \"Look! Rusty is cleaning his starfruit\". Sometimes it's hard in a houseful of males....Anyway, I've had too much pav..Eddie's pound-a-week diet is a arm's length at the moment. Oh well, back to it tomorrow. Hub is taking the boys to Queensland next week for 7 nights and to tell you the truth, I can't wait. I'm looking forward to a silent house, snore-free sleep..all of that stuff. I'm not going because I don't do water, and they are going to be doing all the theme parks. I get to get my home in order..sigh..is that even possible? I love hearing about 'dens'. It means..well..the future..looking forward.  Rock, I laughed my head off about the period, and the moon cups. I haven't had a period since 1994. I can remember trying those cups back then because my periods had become unmanageable. What a fiasco! Suffice to say, I ditched the cups.  Well girls, I'm off to bed, and hoping to get a good sleep. Otter, what is a ..chigger? XXXX",

It's 6.55 Friday night here and I've just eaten a bowl of Hub's spagetti carbonara (with a glass of nice red) after a BIG walk with the Fibber in the dark. It was fantastic. It has been really cold in the mornings here (0 deg C, sometimes -2) but pretty nice days. It's amazing how much better (more enthusiastic!) I feel when I get out and walk in the dark. There were two cosmic Randie acts today. (Jen, if you're weird..then so am I!) The first one was very mischevious; the second was just classic. We had a whole-school assembly today. 280 6yo - 16yo in the gym. All behaving really well etc, but a bit restless half-way through. Some girls got up to run a powerpoint presentation, and their teacher got up and turned the gym lights off. I burst out laughing; they take a full 15 mins to THINK about being warm enough to come on again!. Can you imagine how the kids were?? I couldn't stop thinking it was Ran's work and I laughed and laughed. Later on this afternoon I went to the Grade one room to find a suitable penpal for an Aboriginal girl in the Northern Territory (the far north of Australia..the opposite end to Tasmania!) . I was explaining to the teacher that the little girl has very poor literacy etc etc and then a tiny blonde girl was standing in front of us, waiting patiently for the teacher. The teacher was incredulous, and very subtly showed me the latest testing sheet for the girl, from the school psychologist, which talked about her poor self-esteem, her lack of friends and her dire need for a very simple, very personal literacy project. I was gobsmacked; she was the perfect match! Needless to say her mother was delighted when I rang her, and it was dawning on the little girl that she had a special friend. The Aboriginal girl's letter actually began, \"Dear Special Friend\".  Ah Randie. Thank you. And girls, thank you all for being MY special friends. ",

The 6 LAYING chooks are all asleep, and Drew if off fishing for trout in central Tasmania where it is probably about zero degrees. I went to a felt-making workshop for three hours today and it was really cool. I made hub a hat (to wear to freezing places where he fishes) and it looks great...in a hippy 70s or Jabberwocky kind of way. Anyway, when it is fitted and finished it should be quite neat. I am loving hearing people's stories about winding things up, medically speaking. Dana, you are lagging a bit on that front, but mind!...It's only lagging!! Angels, you putting the heater on in your cabin, when converted to Australian seasons, means that ours will be going off occasionally and then SPRING WILL BE HERE!!! A builder starts work on the sleeping platform (fancy word: mezzanine) in our shed at the beach in about three weeks. I cannot tell y'all how excited I am about that. The episode is called 'Nesting In Preparation for Transition to Retirement', in the bestseller titled 'My New Life' by Kerry Lamb, an author who is done with the fecker cancer. Eddie, I am so impressed with your pound-a-week achievement20 pounds sounds like a mountain but said, 'pound-a-week'..well, that's nothing. I mean, last year (52 pounds back) we were trashed with chemo and all the other shite, and looking forward to touching the bank on the other side. Or being hauled up! Pound-a-week. I'm going to apply that principle to many aspects of my life..especially as we fit out our shedslowly, slowly, pound by pound.  Love y'all, and owe y'all more than I could ever describe. Especially you, Sue, with yer two boobs. Soon I'm going to get up the courage to actually go and buy one of them frothy, frilly things about a 12c..that I've pictured in my dreams. XXX",

All the money raised should go to women like us who are broke for the next couple of years after being through 'treatment', and to lobbyists who will work their a$$es off to get poisons banned from our food, water and air.

I just can't stomach the hypocrisy of the commercial sector.  Lucky the May 08ers have enough love (and humor!) to smooth the seas (and the grumpy Australians). XXX ",

I do a lot of jobs with various individuals and am 'on call' for a shoulder to cry on. Just for interest's sake, I'm going to detail my day..unrehearsed! 4am: I 'awake', freezing (hub sleeps in James' bed on card-night), and am pleased because it means no Get Back!!! flashes, but my bladder is bursting. I don't mind, really, because I have to get up early and freezing and bursting will ensure I don't over-sleep. 6am: I'm about to either become an ice-block or wet the bed. What to do...what to do...Chemo-cat is scratching at the door so I let her in. She gets on the bed and I move her away from my lower abdomen. 6.30: up! Let the dog out, feed the cats and make a pot of tea. Gather my stuff for school, shower, drink the tea, jump into the old Triumph (it starts!), drive it to the mechanic to get the brakes done. It's 7.30. Get picked up, go to Lilydale to work..arrive 8.20. 9am: I'm expecting some girls to arrive for a special project (new school website) but the AP says a little girl's pony has foundered, may have to be put down and she is crying in the library. I talk with her for 20 mins, the other girls find me. We go out and take photographs, I remove two naughty girls from the class of a relief-teacher, get them to take some photographs, return to the library so the sick-pony girl (aged 6) can ring her Mum. As the phone is ringing, her Mum arrives to tell her, \"Scooby-Doo lives!!!\". More tears. 10.40: morning tea. 11 am the naughty, hopeless children arrive to paint a mural. I'm freaking about the potential for that-which-cannot-be-undone.10 mins in, the groundsman comes over to tell me that the council painter needs stencils of human feet (!) so he can finish a pedestrian pathway. I take a naughty, hopeless boy with me and we make the stencils. He tells me all about his trip to the refuse dump last weekend. We cook up a project, and I ring the dump to organise to get 2 bicycles fit for restoration (one for me, one to sell). We clean up from the mural-painting. 12.40: lunchtime. The Home Ec teacher comes to find me and asks me to come to the kitchen. I find a formally set table, and 5 of us are treated to a special lunch. 1pm: yard-duty. 20 mins of \"Rueban's spying on me\" and \"Troy said I shouldn't tell him what to do and I wasn't even telling him\" and \"I've got no-one to play with\" and \"Quick! Quick! Georgia's really hurt herself\", and in the middle of it this beautiful, beautiful tiny girl came up, gave me a hug (around my waist), looked straight at my swollen, blackened face and said, \"You're so pretty\", and ran off skipping.   1.20: end of lunch. A couple of hours to myself to put up a display. No. Bailey (aged 7) arrives with a note which says, \"Bailey would like to help you today\". So we put up the display; it takes twice as long because of the Bailey-Factor and also because there is not a staple in the school to fit my staple-gun. 3.10: my ride home arrives and we leave. She drops me off at the Black Stallion (I shit you not), a gaming pub in a very, very poor area. I had told my husband where to meet me to take me home, and that I would ring him when I got there. So I'm standing outside this really dodgy joint, and my phone is cycling through 'searching...searching...searching...'. No mobile reception!!! Miraculously, Drew pulls up, we call in to check out the car-job, we come home, pay a heap of bills, I cook a fish curry and now I am sitting here with a glass of red, a sleeping dog, two sleeping cats and my man upstairs.       It has been a good, Randy-day. Cancer??? Fuck THAT noise.XXXX    ps Otter, I REALLY wish I was there with you. XX",

The whinge won't achieve a thing, but NOBODY can ignore the horror of the photo.   On another note, I've been so tired this week (despite all kinds of wonderful adrenalin-filled moments and lots of joy) that I'm a bit worried. Can chemo cause serious anemia? I probably need a bit of a blood count, or is this the 'fatigue' that everybody talks about?  Tonight I cooked creamy cauliflower soup with leeks. Man, it was nice. I just couldn't be bothered cooking, so I quite impressed myself.  I'm also rehydrating some dried figs in sherry for a dessert on Sunday night. We have some young friends coming for dinner and I am so grateful for their presence in my life that I feel I'd better go that bit extra for them. Im heading to bed...the animals have all beaten me to it. XXXX",

And the reason for that is that these bastards charge about 4 times the scheduled fee. It goes on and on. I think I told you, the PS charged $4,000 for the re-con and I got $1200 back.

He showed me all around his positively amazing finished projects (including a fish-smoker with an underground updrafting pipe from the fire to the hanging fillets in the smoking chamber) and his carefully hand-made kitchen benches. He was a little weird (apart from his fascinating English accent and Touretty conversation) ..he had a kind of 'chemo-lapse' in his phrasing and waddya know? He has cancer. He has a really rare blood cancer and collapsed immune system, and has chemo every month. He is in remarkable shape (he is 62) and I think is taking most positive approach to whatever time he has left. He talked so emphatically about living life 'in this exact moment'. We had so many laughs. He asked me if I minded talking about 'this stuff', and pointed out that he has no-one else to talk to about it, except doctors. Interesting, isn't it? I think we will be good friends, and Drew can take him out in the tinny, which he will love.   We are all just about one year out from chemo (my last date was Sept 26th). Has this year flown, or am I just imagining it? We booked a trip to Thailand for May next year..the flights are so cheap.

Rock, and all of you, I am hearing you loud and clear about Getting Act Together Failure. I swear I put-off-till-tomorrow every task except changing my undies and feeding the animals. What IS this??? Maybe we have a seriously reordered priorities list or something. Maybe half the tasks of any ordinary life have simply fallen off the bottom of the list. I used to read that thread and laugh, thinking it was one of the comedy threads...but then it took me two years to sew a button on a skirt which I wear at least once per week. That's not really funny.....I've been back on the femara for 4 days and BANG. The feet/leg biz has started up again.

I have had a couple of extraordinary weeks. Two weeks ago I saw Archie Roach and Ruby Hunter in an amazing, intimate concert here in the bush. One week after that (last Saturday) I saw The Clip Clop Club (an underground, iconic, bent C&W band), AC/DC and the Dragon Tenors (Chinese singers of Italian opera..True!!!) IN ONE WEEKEND. I shit you not. At the end of the Dragon Tenors thing (an outdoor concert in Melbourne for Chinese New Year), as I burst into tears at the climax of 'Nessum Dorna\", these towers either side of us, which I had been previously unaware of, shot enormous fireballs into the sky. I thought I would faint from the whole damn thing. Then..THEN!! on Thursday just past, Ruby Hunter died. She just..died. Google her; she was a remarkable Aboriginal woman, and I had an amazing yarn with her about our Stolen Generations (she and Archie were stolen) at the concert just three weeks ago. Oh man, what a conversation. She had a radius of about 10' of the most peaceful spirit around her and talked of nothing but forgiveness and reconciliation. And then yesterday, Mary MacKillop was canonised. Has anyone EVER had three weeks like this?? Google Mairs while you're at it. Boy could she teach this mad world a thing or two...poverty, broken family, hardship, giftedness, faith, hardiness, single-minded-female can-do attitude and, most importantly, she would not take any shite from the patriarchs (and they numbered, and weighed, plenty!). I can just imagine Mary on this forum. She would understand the troubles, the new-boob journeys (I don't have nipples..can't afford themthe mad relatives, the burdensome responsiblities, our denial of them, our giftedness, our humor, our steely strength, our comprehensive fear and our bloody-minded war with it.

I've been walking heaps but I actually think my left leg is swelling a couple of mm each day. It is certainly uncomfortable. AND it pees me off. At least I don't want to eat everything I look at, which is a nice change!  I'm hating the clothes not fitting grrrrrrr! Randie, are you there?? Hello? I guess by now you have your drains out and are starting to get your head around what has actually happened. There's a lot of adrenalin beforehand then...real life with all its new challenges. I hope you are getting lots of love and care and that plenty of people are spoiling you. I've got a really dumb question: what is herceptin? XXXto you all. ",

Three tips on my right hand have been so tender..like yours, but that has stopped now. The white nail tips are fine, but the parts connected to the fingers are yellowing from the top down, have some bands across them and I have only 3 moons out of ten! I'm not that worried about them..I guess I will be REALLY worried if they start coming loose . I'm more concerned about the spare tractor tyre around the middle. It's like..I've been concentrating on getting through one day at a time and now that I'm feeling good again I'm starting to notice everything in detail..from the muffin-top look to the embarrassing pile of 'to do' at work. Oh well...I haven't forgotten to play the cancer card just yet! Noelle! What do you call a 'little' race? How long after you started moving the body again did you start to see jumps in aerobic fitness, and general strength? I'm hanging on your every word here!! XXXto you all.",

It's weird, after reading about your Fall / snowy posts to report that it was a perfect almost summer day here today, a beautiful evening to walk the Fibber after the visit to the PS and before the family-effort dinner-cooking. Alex (15 going on 16 ) and Hub did the chicken and veg, and James (12) and I did the apple-upside-down cake. I don't know which stroke of genius it was that got the lads cooking but it's really nice and it's argument-free (at last!!) The visit to the (French) (girl) plastic surgeon was great and at this stage I will be having the implant next May (anniversary present!) and a reduction on the left in the December. Scary and exciting.... Ellenoire, I love the family images I get from you..how mad! What a great movie it would all make.Actually, Gracie's softball-playing wake would be a great inclusion as well. A family I know here are German, and their family in Germany are so large and so mad about soccer that they have a proper fixture each year and each family HAVE THEIR OWN UNIFORMS!!!  Otter, I'm pleased to hear about your ma and pa and I empathize re the cold.

I am famous for exaggerating, but I swear my beard, neck hair and cheek hair is growing faster and longer than that on my head. My husband has been stroking my face the same way as he pats my cat. This is a worry. What is slowly dawning on me is that this is the next revelation: why women my age seem to wear so many quilted, sleeveless jackets; why women my age have a reddish, prickly glow about the chops: it's from waxing their face!  Why the phrase 'spare tyre' was coined. Why women my age take ages to stand up straight and hobble before they walk.   PLEASE tell me that this is not to be my permanent life! Does this fluff on the face go away or should I have it waxed (on my way to buy a quilted, sleeveless jacket) ?    All you happy girls: WAY TO GO!! This has been a long time coming..7 months. I know we are not out of the woods yet, but after this last 7 months I feel as though we can manage just about ANYTHING that comes our way. Noelle..what's going on with your shop that I should be excited about?

It seems to have subsided in the last month or so. Maybe it's because I am on holidays and maybe it's because I exercise every day without fail. I haven't been anxious about cancer; it's more an overwhelming feeling of being anxious for anxiety's sake! I imagine the feeling precedes a full on panic attack..thankfully I never went that far. Gracie, I can't remember where you are at with treatment. Is the swelling a post-chemo thing? I look at pics of me toward the end of chemo and I was VERY puffy..to the point of serious discomfort in the abdomen, but my face and hands/feet were swollen too. I was quite worried about it. (Heart???Kidneys???) Somewhere else on here I read that it subsides over a period of weeks and that is what has happened, although I still get the slightly swollen 'little old lady' feet. I still can't wear my wedding bands and I hate that. And good on you for challenging your daughter. As a teacher/chaplain I experience the fallout from this kind of lifestyle every day. It breaks my heart to see how kids struggle with instability and how brave they are. Old girls like us need to call a spade a shovel at every opportunity!

I hope you have a staff of caring people to wait on you hand and foot when you get home. When I was about 18 my aunt told me she had to have a hysterectomy. I asked her what one was (!) She laughed and said it was where they took away the playpen and left the playground. I had no idea what she was talking about, and when it dawned on me ten years later I was horrified that my aunt would make such a joke.

I have been shocked by the hand and feet pain, especially the feet and especially first thing in the morning. No more springing out of bed for me, and no gambolling down the stairs, or running down (late for work).  Now here's the thing: I was going to quit. I am made of cast iron, but I could not bear the hot flushes or the broken feet. But then I remembered that I am a May O'8 girl and we LAUGHHAHA at cancer, so I decided to experiment. I altered the time I took the tablet. No difference. Then I started to take a half tablet at 7am and a the other half at 7pm. The hot flushes are amazingly far fewer (and remember it's summer here..so..hot nights). I also doubled my dose of glucosamine from 1500mg to 3000 (one tablet morning and night). No more phantom carpel-tunnel syndrome, and the feet are much better. I discussed the half-tablet biz with my onc today. He was able to find out that it was fine as far as the actual tablet absorption goes. He is finding out if the more even dose, rather than one big whammy per day, is going to change the effectiveness of the drug.

We grew up in a very old, draughty relocated farmhouse and had no cooling, save a fan which was reserved for Dad (who worked his guts out in that heat, and needed to sleep at night.) When we had a heat-wave (eg 10 days of temps over 35C) the floorboards would be hot to walk on, and we would sleep outside on the verandah with wet sheets over us! Here in Tas we get some pretty warm days, and the sun stings here because of the thinner ozone layer, but it's mild really and goes on until the end of April. Last May (!)

That pisses me off. ONE of my chooks is of egg-laying age and she's not interested. I have a couple of very thick hydrangeas in the chook-run and 3 big tree ferns..the chickens' favorite spot is as far under the bushes as possible.They love it! So in order to enjoy them, I have to gently scare them out with a rake and then watch them scurry for cover....sigh...This weekend is a long-weekend here so I will be doing my pre-winter mods to the chook-house. I will also be rigging up some more appropriate housing for the Fibber and the Ranga, both of whom will freeze if I don't. The kitten is insane and hilarious. Christina (big puss) actually really likes him, which makes me suspect an evil plan....I like the logo thang; I do a lot of those sort of jobs but try to avoid them, really, and we have plenty of ability on this little forum! Would '17 Sisters' do it? Or would it blow? rofl! ....I can't remember the exact date of my mastectomy; it was late March, I think. I am 'celebrating' by (two days ago) booking in for a second mastectomy (well, gosh! The first one was so cool!!!) and a double recon. Now here's the important part: the PS, who is a gorgeous and, more importantly REAL, gun surgeon uses a French technique whereby she goes in through the mast scare, goes down toward the bottom of the rib-cage, and then cuts across that outer band of muscle, which gets folded up-ways and covers the lower half of the implant. The upper half of the implant goes under the pec muscle. Then the skin is hoiked up (that's not a special PS term, btw!) and forms the cover for the lower part of the 'breast'. You basically get a bit of a tummy tuck thrown in. No expanders etc. Did y'all play the film in your mind as I was describing it? I am very excited about this, mainly because my cancer-surgeon will be there too and is a huge fan of this short (3hr), safe surgery with quick recovery-time. AND I have the number of a gal who I can talk to and check her job out. Will keep you posted.   ....Childhood sadness? I can hardly bear it. I simply cannot bear pain in children.I will pray that every one of you can set your sad childhood experiences aside in a quiet and still place and leave them there. From this exact moment on: life is full of inconveniences but is actually made of joy, even if tears have to flush that joy out, much like panning for goldwhat a long post!  My song? Rock and Roll..Led Zeppelin..................(wtf........................?)",

I am totally fecking OVER health issues. And Life issues, for that matter. Every person on this board has suffered enough. That's official. Sue, Jen..Jackie..Rock..ALL of you...Is there something in the stars???? I have had a hectic, crap week. I am busy as hell at work, and then the boss says I have to pack up my office by Easter, because the building is being redeveloped. Took a deep breath and thought..I've done cancer..I can do packing. THEN he tells me I have to be packed by TODAY. We had a massive and magnificent thunderstorm, which is all very well but how do you move stuff when it is BUCKETING??? Then at 3.30 I was able to get an appt for 4.30.with the physio to look at a tight hammy and a sore shoulder. At 5pm the ditz in reception told me to 'Come through', and for 15 mins I perched myself on the edge of a grimy bench, looking at scuffed walls and, I kid you not, picking MAN HAIRS off the sus-looking sheet on the bench. I had a quick consult with the physio, was reduced to my bra and undies and left for another 15 mins with the acupuncture needles in my shoulder and hammy. THEN Ditz-Girl came in and said, \"I'm takin out ya needles\", pulled them out and literally plonked a hot-pack on my back, and said, \"There ya go.\"  I lay there for a further 15 mins..despite the hot-pack I was freezing cold (still in my undies on the grimy man-haired bench). THEN she came back and told me I could get dressed and go. I asked her if I still had needles in my hamstring and she laughed, hahahahahah, and said, \"Oh! Blind as a bat. Sorry about that.\" I left the building two hours after my scheduled appointment, frozen stiff and hating my life. WHO THE FECK are these people??????       Jen, I am so glad your Dad is getting the bike ready for you. It made me teary to think of a Dad looking after his girl (in the way that mine would.)  And Sue, I blubbered like girl to think of you on your last day...it's REAL! You are free. On much happier notes, today at school a big, plain boy about 10 years old was lined up waiting when he saw me (for the first time since last year), and his face was just...incredulous. He told me my hair looks \"AWESOME!!!! It's just AWESOME!!!!\". Then one of my Year 9 girls stopped dead in her tracks and said, \"OMG you've got beautiful skin\". I got a bit teary afterwards. I've been feeling pretty shite for a while..but then these little 5 minute miracles crop up...Tonight I've got a completely psycho ginger tom-kitten hard-core harrassing all of us, especially my big cat. It's funny enough to win me prizes on telly. No video-camera..sigh..Noelle..I just don't know what to say except...summer's coming and...your future is in your understanding of curly hair.

My workplace ( a prep - Yr 10 country school) is a love factory and is very supportive. It's important to be distracted and happy. I have chemo on a Friday so I can rest over the weekend. The steroids keep me awake for about 3 days, and its hard to go to work sleep-deprived so being quiet and still (though awake) is possible over a weekend.  Make sure you don't eat too much or eat food which taxes the digestive system (like big steaks) I have rolled rye for breakfast (cooked for 2 mins in the MW) which I have soaked in water overnight. I add 2 tablespoons of ground linseed and have it with low fat soy milk. I also eat some pumpernickle every day. This all keeps the colon active. Believe me, this is important. Eat plenty of silverbeet, fresh beetroot and salads. Your blood tests will be better for it. Drink masses of water because dehydration truly is your enemy and will keep you away from work. I went back to work two weeks after my mastectomy. I was vigilant about the physio exercises because you only have ONE recovery period, so make it count. You DO NOT want to have reduced arm/shoulder mobility. Remember..you are going to live a long and active life :)  You might want to reconsider having a double M. Remember you need  a good set of veins for future tests etc. And a double risk lymphedema? No way..not unless you really have to.  The fatigue was a shock. Everything you read about exercising is true. It's just that about 3 or 4 days after chemo you might be too tired to even think. When you are not too tired, walk miles. Make this a priority because it will make you feel better and keep you going to work. Always have some antacid tablets with you and eat them. They are a mini miracle. Most importantly, go to bed early..7pm is not too early! Even if you can't sleep, it's incredibly important to let your body do as little as possible apart from kill those cancer cells!  Good luck with it, and don't be afraid. This is a big, fat adventure. You will be an iron maiden after this! Much love! ",

I have adapted over the last 6  months to using my left arm more and more, and that works. My Dad had a really serious farming accident when he was 55 (nearly tore his right arm off when using a post-hole digger) and he totally rehabilitated himself to use his left arm, even to the point of playing lawn bowls left-handed and won Club Champion!  I have also become 'super aware' of my right arm, rather than 'obsessed'. That has helped, because like you I want to truly LIVE my life. We also have pump-bottles of that antibacterial gel around every corner to put on nicks and scratches etc., and packets of good-quality water-proof bandaids.  ",

I had a girl from wigsonwheels (in Australia) come to my house and she was brilliant. The wig cost about $350, which was a lot. I was tempted to buy online but was terrified of the colour,quality etc being disappointing. Marci's suggestion to try then buy online is an excellent one. I buzz-cut my hair and wore the wig straight away. I felt in control that way, and actually quite empowered. I put nivea cream over the whole lot..cheap and good!  I have struggled with 'dressing up as someone else' (and looking so much younger!) and wore a beanie for most of our winter, but now I can't wear the beanie..too much sunshine! I am going to buy a shorter more summery looking one because I'm not going to have hair to speak of until about April next year, and I can't do the scarf thing. Make sure the wig is not too tight..it will feel weird as it is but tight is BAD for wearing all day. Much as I don't like a wig, I have been grateful to have it.

You will be a bit sore, but I think you will be pleasantly surprised on that front. Take 1000 omega 3 fish oil caps. For some reason they gave me a great kick-along. Your recovery will also be surprisingly quick, especially if you follow the surgeons advice to the letter. This was hard for me... Don't be afraid of taking simple pain-killers so you can sleep. It's lack of sleep that will wear you down and do your head in. Cancer is a very private world and men can feel shut out because they, by gender, just want things fixed (and they can't fix them, in this case). I encouraged my beautiful husband to just be quietly very loving, and to spend time with his most supportive male friends. This has been great. Basically, we can't access their pain and fears, and they can't access ours. It should never become a competition..that can be very destructive. So mutual love, support and tenderness is absolutely the best thing.  I got the shock of my life when my lumpectomy proved positive, and because of the type of breast tissue I have, I had to go with the big 'M'. (I could not screen very well in the future). So be prepared for that suggestion, but don't freak out about it. It's easy to! But resist. One day at a time really is the go. XX",

White meat and 3 veg, 3 fruit, fish from Alaska, eggs, some yoghurt & cheese and nothing but whole grains (bread and cereal) is pretty much it. Water, caught in a bucket from the sky.

It started when we were tiny..for whatever reason, and what we put in our mouths HUGELY effects it. Teach you daughter to LOVE physical activity too.

(The wigs are not their own hair..but same deal with the glue etc). You can check it out on YouTube, from memory. But they have healthy scalps with growing hair underneath. I bought a wig, buzzed my mane, and just started wearing it as though it grew like that. I am a teacher and my wig is the OPPOSITE to my normal hair but the kids adjusted and still keep telling me how beautiful my hair is..which is a bit of a worry..my real hair will disappoint them when it grows back!   I found it essential all the way through chemo to slather the nivea cream on my skull, and to monitor the skin. The thing is, time flies believe it or not and once you lose your hair, you will be less stressed about it. I am more stressed trying to get something resembling eyebrows drawn on! I am grateful for my wig but NEVER wear it at home. Good luck! Tough it out. It ends!!!",
