I found a marble shape bump in one breast about two months ago. I thought its nothing (I know dumb) but about 3 weeks ago that one breast got red, swollen, and hurt when it moved. When I took a deep breath it hurt at times and only on the same side as that breast. I went to the doctor and was told I'm young its probably just an infection so I was given antibiotic and an anti-inflammatory twice a day each for a week. I asked but why does it hurt to breathe and was told its all inflammed in there probably. As the week went on the redness went away and the swelling but there is something in there. I do not feel the marble but the breast has a swollen looking area, it still hurts when I take a deep breath, and sometimes the shoulder and upper back hurt only on that side. I told my doctor after the week long antibiotic was done and then waited for my ultrasound referral. I had my ultrasound and now have to wait 2-3 days for it to be read and sent to my doctor. I said \"can you at least tell me if you see something\" and was told she cant say anything because she does the ultrasound but the radiologist needs to read it. With my insurance it seems its like a wait of 4 days for referral then a week for an appointment. So to ease my worrying and being sad until I hear back, has anyone had a similar experience? In my opinion either the marble I had felt popped inside and is causing something or it is still there and I do not feel it with the inflammation or it is blocking a duct causing issues? No dimpling, no discoloration, redness went away. No arm swelling and it is in medial chest almost between both breast area but to the left breast side only. Thanks Log in to post a reply",

I went to my doctor again today for a recheck of the bump and was told the ultrasound did not show anything abnormal. BUT what is it then? The doctor reexamined me and said there is some lump/marble thing. So I was sent for an xray to see if it will show something.  I thought ultrasound would show better than an xray. I'll find xray results Monday. Thank you.  About getting the run around, if you care to read lol. I have hmo insurance so I have a primary doctor who then referred me for an ultrasound then their radiologist read it and sends a report to my doctor. Now my xray was at another place today and I was told when their person reads it and writes their report it will be send to my doctor but now I have to wait til Monday because my doctor doesnt work fri/sat/sun. Its my insurance and the waiting is making me anxious and sad at times. Thinking....too much.",
