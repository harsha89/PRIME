I came home with lots of supplements to help with nausea, inflammation and immune system support. I was already taking quite a few supplements before my cancer dx so I think that helped a lot along with my 3x a week workout routine. Exercise I've learned is key in this fight so if you can please incorporate it if only a 15 - 30 minute daily walk. I haven't had any major night sweats or nausea as of yet but this is just day 1 after treatment. I too have a Neulasta patch so I'm not sure what affect that will have on my body once it goes off later this evening. I'll keep you posted. Ladies we are all Survivalists and can beat this disease if only one day at a time. Stay positive I know it's easier said than done cause I've had my share of days but we have to encourage each other.  Z",
