Last week i found another lump, went to doctors to be told i actually have 3 lumps (2 in one breast i didn't feel). I'm now wanting for a hospital appointment within the next 2 weeks.  I'm just a mess, my husband is in Afgan so i don't want to tell him and worry him, i don't want to tell my family as they went to pieces last time - my mother died at 45 after having breast cancer twice, my gran had breast cancer, and on my mothers side there has been another 5 women with breast cancer. I have had been seen by a genetic consultant and was going to start mammography from 35 anyway. I have 3 little ones under 6 years and everytime i look at them i just start crying. When my mother died my little brother was only  9 months older than my oldest. How do you cope?    Log in to post a reply",
