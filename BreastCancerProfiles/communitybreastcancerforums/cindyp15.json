I just started on sunday and dont like how i'm feeling, thinking maybe it's the way i'm taking them.  I take 4 Xeloda pills in the morning an hour after i eat breakfast and take my 5 tykerb around 4:00 pm, 4 hrs after lunch and then the other 3 Xelodas around 8:00 pm.  My stomach's all messed up and i've been taking 1 or 2 immodiums in the morning??  I appreciate any of your feedback on this. also, do you have to be careful with what you eat??

I've been off/on chemo and hormonals since then. My liver mets were completely wiped away from Taxol back in 2001, but keep coming back now.  I'm currently doing Abraxane and Herceptin and Zometa. I'm somewhat stable and still hoping to knock it back out again!",

My next treatment is scheduled next week. My dr is stopping the carbo & changing me to weekly taxotere/herceptin at a lower dose. I'm scared to death of doing round 2 due to my severe reaction. Has anyone else had this happen before, the colitis?  If so, do you think the smaller weekly dose will be more tolerable? I gained 10 lbs of fluid while in the hospital and am just now losing that. I don't know if I should try doing round 2 or ask for a new chemo? Dx 6/20/1995, DCIS, 2cm, Stage IV, 1/11 nodes, mets, ER+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
