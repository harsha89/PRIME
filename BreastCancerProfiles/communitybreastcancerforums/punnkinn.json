In 2008 I went to my first Neurologist because the pain was mild but botherome.  In 2010 went to a new doctor hwo said I had Carpal Tunnel.  Well after two surgeries and arm and hand getting much worse, tingling, vise-like pain from where my port was up my right side, down my arm and into the whole hand.  Surgeon and Neurologist couldn't understand why they referred me to Shands Hospital in Gainsville.  They thouight it could be Radiation Brachial Plexopathy.  Told me to go see my radiation doctor. To make a long story shorter (because I can hardly type anymore, IT HURTS).  I have been through Acupuncture, chiropractic, phycial therpy, pain management where I had 6 Ganglion Blocks and 1 epidural.  Nothing helped.  Went to a new Neurologist and he agreed with the doctor at Shands.  Also says that there is no cure but could start me on Trental.  Have not heard anything from this doctor as yet. I am glad to read all these comments from people who are in the same pain.  It helps mentally but not with the pain.",
