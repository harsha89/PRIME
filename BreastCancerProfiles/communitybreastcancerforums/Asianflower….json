I will start radiation next week. I'm fortunate to have incredibly intelligent & compassionate specialists. I have gone through all of this alone & have found that doing as much research as possible (via the internet) has made it easier to make important decisions. This has not been easy, but I can get through it - as can you. Asianflowers ",
