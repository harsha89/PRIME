My grandma who passed in 2006, my uncle who passed in 2008 and my mother, who is a cancer survivor! I have had pain and tenderness in both breasts, with swelling in just my left breast for almost a week now. I feel a movable, squishy lump in the left breast and it's quite tender. I am scheduled to see my GP on December 6th and I'm trying not to freak out while I wait. I took a home pregnancy test just in case it was hormonal, it came back negative. I'm back and forth between \"could it be an infection or Cancer!?\" There is no redness or pitting, just pain. Some advice on how to cope with this anxiety or words of wisdom from anyone in a similar position would be much appreciated! Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
