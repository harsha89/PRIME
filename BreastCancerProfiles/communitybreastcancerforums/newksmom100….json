Maggie - It's going to be okay.  My RO asked me to use the lotion 3x/day (morning, following my 3:45 treatment and at bedtime).  So far, so good, all things considered.  Your posts have been a blessing to me.  Keep your chin up, we are all here for you and you can do ANYTHING! I had asked last week if anyone had an idea of costs...thanks to those who responded.  I looked online at my insurance company today and the billed rate for my treatments is $742.02/day.  That is about what I expected, but of course that is not exactly what insurance pays.  I am in San Antonio, so of course costs will vary depending on where you are.  Thought this might be helpful for those of you who are curious like I was. One question for everyone.  I am still having a little pain due to the seroma.  I'm 7 weeks post surgery.  Is anyone else having this problem and what are you doing for it?  I'm having a little trouble getting comfortable at night.   Thanks everyone, know that I am thinking good thoughts for all of you.   Julie",

For all that are done, congratulations, I am very happy for you.  For those who are coming up behind, hang in there. YOU CAN DO IT.  For those who are really struggling, know that you are in my thoughts and I truly wish I could help.  Chef, I am sorry for the loss of your son.  Both of my sons' are in the military and both have been to Afghanistan doing their part to stop the group responsible for the horror of 9/11.  I hope it gives you a sense of peace knowing that they truly are doing the best they can.  We will never, ever forget those who were lost that day and continue to lift the families in prayer.  Ladies, I'm not sure why we were all chosen for this journey, but I am blessed to have you all here to share it with.  ",
