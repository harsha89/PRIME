    "Content": "Jshe wrote: I had a mid score on my OncoDX. My Medical Oncologist placed the decision to do Chemo or not back on me - a rough decision to make. So, after a little research I found that the Mammoprint test helped to sort people \"who fell in the mid-zone\". I requested this test from my Medical Oncologist and it delivered. This test was covered by my insurance company and was recently (Jan 2012) approved by the FDA to be done on preserved (not fresh) tissue. I encourage those of you who are falling in the mid-range of the OncoDX test to research the mammoprint test and ask your doctor about this option. Doctors are not used to ordering this test, be patient with them as they figure out the \"how to's\" . - my State's lab actually had to apply for licensure to run this test (so results took longer then expected). Many people get sorted into the low risk category after taking this test (peace) - those who don't know they are making the right choice by doing Chemotherapy (also peace). I wish you all well in your journey- hope by sharing this information I encourage you to research and ask questions - better to do it right then to do it fast. Take a few extra days/weeks to do your homework & don't let fear control you, use your power! Log in to post a reply",
