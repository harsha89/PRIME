It seems 7\" may not be high enough, but 12\" may be overkill. We are a recliner-less household, and now that I'm noticing, we don't even have a chair or sofa that comes up beyond neck level!

I was waiting and waiting for someone to start a May Mastectomies thread when I was scheduled for a May 1 surgery (I'll be thinking of you Floridamomandwife!) here in CT.  However, now I've changed surgeries, surgeons, states, and dates (June 15th, NS/SS direct to implant in Florida), so I'm back to waiting.  Okay if I hang out with you all until someone starts a June thread?  I'm not quite sure how to update, otherwise I'd just start a June thread.  For now I'll just focus my positive energy on you ladies of May. xo",
