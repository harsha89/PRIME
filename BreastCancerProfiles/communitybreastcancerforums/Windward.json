MARY- what a great idea to give radiation staff. I love the idea of little candies in a jar. I was going to get that large jar of jelly beans from Costco ( sort of like little Easter eggs?) but I did not know what to put them in. Will get to Target this weekend for the neat jar. SUNNYONE22 - I love your visuals. What a great idea to measure the passage of time; according to the disappearance of gumballs. I bet Einstein would even be impressed. And, as you say you get a treat. I get to the rad center early enough to make a hot chocolate in their coffee/ tea / and goodie bar - that being my treat. I am 6 days down, and 22 to go, and time is going fast, of course I have not reached the point of getting SE effects yet. Am intrigued by the cabbage leaf recommendation, have to copy that on a note pad, for just in case. So glad to hear all the joy and relief of all who have completed course of radiation, and relieved to hear the SE do eventually subside. Careful hugs to all, Windward   ",

I just went over my notes from the experience and have some information that might be of help. The best help for constipation, was and still is a combination of CALM and Benefiber. Two powders that you mix together in hot water and sip after dinner. The recipe calls for 1 tbsp, which seemed like a lot so I started with a scant half tsp of each, knowing I could increase it each nite if needed . It was and still is, great. As for nausea, I was given a host of pills for possible nausea, or dizziness, or cramps, or reflux, or diarrhea ,all for just in case. I was advised, wisely to take the indicated pill at the very first hint of discomfort . Don't wait until it is full blown. Doing that really helped, though I did not need anti nausea very often,and did not need the other pills. They have so many great meds these days. there is no reason to have to suffer. Took Claritin before and several days after the Neulasta injections and had no bone or any pain. There is no medication for the exhaustion. I had my infusion on Fridays. I was in good shape on Saturdays, and crashed on Sundays. Monday I was back at work. I have all kinds of other helpful hints I learned from the CMF board that I was talking with at the time. If you have any questions, please let me know. I have not checked this board for a long time, but I will now. A big hug to you all, Windward  ",
