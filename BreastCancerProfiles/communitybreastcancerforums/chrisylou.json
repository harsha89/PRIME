I didn't want to go that route so he referred me to Dr. Wapnir at Stanford. My experience there was great. I turned 63 in August and am a small woman with a much younger husband. I have been married for 28 years. Dr. Wapnir understood my need for breast conserving surgery. My tumor was a 3 cm. high grade tumor,Zero stage. When I arrived at Stanford on August 16th (the day before my surgery) Dr. Wapnir advised me that she suspected the tumor was not DCIS but invasive cancer because DCIS does not usually occur in women my age. So I signed for a Lymph Node biopsy just in case. I had my lumpectomy the next day with no complications and very little pain. The surgery confirmed it was DCIS and the 3 Nodes she removed were clear. Unfortunately, I did have to go back because, even though the margins were clear, Dr Wapnir was not comfortable with the depth of the margin and I had a re-excision to get a 2mm clear margin. Although it's only a week since the re-excision, I am thrilled with the results. There is no bruising and very little swelling. Either I am a great healer or she is an artist! My concern now is radiation. I don't want it because of the side effects. I already have an inherited cholesterol problem and cant afford to weaken my heart.",

My husbands cousin was diagnosed with breast cancer and opted for a Mast. and voluntarily had her lymph nodes removed hoping to avoid a recurrance. 2 years later, the cancer was back as a stage one in her underarm putting her straight into chemo. Age has a lot to do with it. If you are young, btwn 30 & 50 chances of recurrence are higher than if you are older. I am a firm believer that every treatment you take in the beginning reduces your options when and if the cancer returns. I am fresh out of a lumpectomy and re-excision for clear margins. The surgeon is recommending radiation which, I am told, reduces the chances of recurrence by 50%. If I have the radiation and the cancer returns, I will not be able to have radiation again to the same breast. My close friend had a lumpectomy 10 years ago (at 50) and opted for no radiation. Her cancer could return but she still has that option as a first line of defense. Over these last 10 years, the golf ball sized tissue that was removed from her breast has filled in and there is no difference between the surgery breast and the non surgery breast. I know everyone is different, but these are the only two women I know who had essentially the same diagnosis and went radically different ways in treatment. I am more worried about the effects of radiaton on my heart and lungs than I am about the cancer returning. For me, at 63, I'd rather not do anything further and wait to see if it returns. If I can get 10 or 15 clear years like my friend. I'll be happy. If it doesn't come back until I'm 78, I won't care if I have to lose my breast or take radiation. That's what I'm betting on. Good Luck with your decision and God bless.",
