My options I think are implants or to make the left one smaller and higher to match the now small and perky right side after the 2 lumpectomies.  I would love to know what the PS says about implants.  The 2 main reasons I was afraid of them was because of having to get them re-done every so often, and about making it harder to detect recurrence.  I wonder if those assumptions are true.  Will you let us know what he/she says?",

Thank you all so very much for all of the support you have given me these past 6 weeks - you all are amazing women!   It was a tear-filled moment for me ringing the bell this morning and saying goodbye to my techs.  In a way, it's a little scary to be done and no longer surrounded by such supportive people because it feels like now I'm off and into \"good luck\" territory - it honestly feels like when they hand you your child leaving the hospital and say \"off you go!\"  out of the protective cozy hospital environment. I'm trying to stay strong and confident that I'm now in the driver's seat and I'm really being active in changing my diet, doing exercise and reducing stress - it's a different kind of prescription.   I wish everyone the very best of luck.  Kickon2it - I'm so sorry that you back in this position again and I send you tons of good vibes. Thanks again all - I'll stay on for a while to see how everyone is doing!",

Also, my acupuncture guy said my skin was changing in texture (while looking at my legs mind you) so he gave me some herbs to help with the free radicals.  I should check though since you all were talking about antioxidents not being good during treatment - hopefully these are ok to take at the same time, I'm glad I saw that post! Have a great day!",

A rectangle of pink in the treatment area like I was in the sun too long, but that's it so far. I'm expecting more redness and peeling and itch since I still have a bit to go, but I'll enjoy it while it lasts.   Too funny about the bras!  I bought these gap body non-underwires that I wear to work and then use cami's at home with the shelf in them.  Still having a hard time wearing t-shirts and having the lopsidedness look be so obvious (had lumpectomy, but on smaller side and now they are quite a bit different).  Feel badly since I'm thankful that I still have both, but the disparity may bother me enough to make the other one smaller to match.  I may talk to a plastics person when the radiation is over.   Anyway, turns out there are no antioxidents in my chinese herbs so that's good.  Getting harder to get through the work day without yawning a lot.  Just need to make it long enough to put my 2 and 4 year olds to bed and then I can pass out :) Hope everyone has a great day",

I've been doing the best I can to stay up with all of the posts but am usually not online over the weekends with the kids running around, so I feel out of the loop! Had #22 today.  Thursday will be the last full-on treatment, then I do 5 boosts.  Should finish Feb 3rd if all goes well, but we'll see.  Still feel very fortunate that my skin is doing well.  LOL the week my RO was out of town (he's anti-anything creamwise), the RO I did see told me to start using Aquaphor which I did.  Worst spot is right under the armpit where it's getting zapped twice because of the beam placement - getting bumpy and red but it's manageable.  Mostly, I just yawn all day.  Looking forward to having energy back. So, anyone else glad we are doing this in winter?  I can't imagine being all hot and sweaty in Houston summer with this red burning skin!",

Only bummer news is that my RO said if I wanted to consider any type of reconstruction I had to wait 12-18mos since that's when my right breast would settle down after everything.  He said since the goal is symmetry, you want to wait until it's finished changing before you try to make anything match it.  Makes sense, but I was hoping for more like a couple of months, not over a year! ugh...",

They just want to \"boost\" treatment to that area to make damn sure they get the source! I have 5 boosts all together, today was #2 so I should finish on Thursday if all goes well.",
