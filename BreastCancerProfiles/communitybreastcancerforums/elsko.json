I am frightened to death. Do you know where can I find the info about meeting with people face to face in my area? I appreciate any suggestions, including financial which is a nightmare as well, I have student insurance that does not cover much, but visiting family in Canada where I am going to stay for the treatment time. How long was your treatment all together? and how often? Where are you now with the treatment protocol? xo, Elena",
