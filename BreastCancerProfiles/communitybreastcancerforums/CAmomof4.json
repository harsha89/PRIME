    "Content": "CAmomof4 wrote: Hi All, I am scheduled to have left mastectomy on Monday April 6th. I am diagnosed Triple Negative, and likelihood of recurrence is high. Plus, the AC part of my AC + Taxol and Carbo didn't have an impact on the tumor, so am concerned about residual disease potential in nodes (had several positive nodes in chest on PET/CT prior to chemo). I've been reading about vaccine type treatments and there seems some potential for these treatments in the future, so was thinking of trying to store my tumor as tumor is needed to make the vaccine. Anyone ever done this? I've found at least 2 companies, one much more expensive than the other, but the less expensive one would be manageable. Thoughts? Thanks, Mel.
