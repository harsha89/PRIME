There was a blue ring around my nipple was for a few days and the blue pee went away by the weekend. It kind of makes me wonder what the surgeon sees in the OR. Do we bleed purple?",

There is some comfort in knowing there are others going through the same thing at the same time. I don't feel quite so alone.",

For anyone who doesn't know what to expect, here's how they lumpectomy went for me.  On a side note, I'm allergic to amoxicillin so they gave me a different antibiotic which caused me to babble like crazy after the surgery. Apparently, I announced that I was mad at the surgeon for cutting me while dressed like a Smurf. Told the nurse I was mad at the dog for not helping me escape to Mexico. Told anyone who would listen that i needed an ice cream sundae. Then explained exactly which ingredients would go into it (Apparently lots of chocolate, brownies and fudge). Then informed them that my bf was mean, and probably wouldn't let me have a sundae. Then i babbled about Chinese food for a while. Apparently i wouldn't shut up. The good news is that they only took 2 nodes out and the surgeon believes they are clear. Just have to wait for the pathology report to hopefully confirm. ",

It's scary and no matter how much you read about someone else's experience, you still have to get through it yourself. I shed a lot of tears before my surgery, but I think the stress of the unknown was worse than the actual procedure. Hopefully you'll feel the same way once you're on the other side of your surgery.",

So I called the nurse navigator and asked about it. That's when she told me that they'd switched to a new type of dye because they were getting those types of complaints. She said that was the main selling feature for therm, that the manufacturer advertised it was less painful. But I didn't feel anything. I'm not sure this is a very recent change though. The threads that mention the dye being painful are several years old, and I couldn't find any references to it after about 2014. But when I heard about potential pain, I needed to know what to expect. The part that she said was a recent change is using the magnetic seed rather than a guide wire. Malizabeth - Unfortunately, i don't have any info on lymphodema or the pain you're experiencing. Hopefully someone else can help with your questions. Felinemum - I didn't have special prep either. It may be based on the specific procedures being done, or maybe it's just the preference of the hospital.",
