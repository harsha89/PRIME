Got the \"red devil\" (my nurse description) and Cytoxan..3-4 hours later I'm feeling queasy and fatigued. Took Compazine and had been chewing ice chips which seems to help. I will have AC every 21 days x 4cycles followed by Taxotere then Herceptin and Perjeta. This is the Arm 1 of the KAITLIN study I'm enrolled in. Anybody on the Arm 2 study?. Maybe we can compare notes. until then goodnight!  update: Vomited hours later that i was brought to the ER Friday for IV hydration. My serum sodium went down i had to stay for 23 hour observation in the hospital until all my electrolytes are back to normal. Maybe i should be drinking more but i have this bitter taste in my mouth. i hope next cycle will be better... ",
