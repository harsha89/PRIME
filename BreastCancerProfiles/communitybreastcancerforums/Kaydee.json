I havn't had a good night sleep in a long time.  Its past 1 and I am still up.  I have a two nightmares about my boobs.  One time my boob was actually attacking me!!  I'm afraid to take meds for fear that I won't wake up if my baby needs me.  Playing with my little one is my best stress relever.  Reading seems to be helping too.  I like the smut mags.... They are just mindless reading, thats all I need right now.  Good luck to you all!! ",
