I am so glad I did, and I have loved seeing others' cuts too. Luv2sing I am sorry your husband has not wanted you to shave your head. It is a shame he did not like your short cut. I am very lucky -  boyfriend was totally delighted when I showed up at his place last night with my new 'do. Indeed he said it made him feel a bit odd because I looked so much younger that he felt a bit of a dirty old man (he is 36 I am 35!).  When I was at the hairdressers' and she was beginning to do serious cutting the radio was playing \"the end of the world as we know it\" by REM. It cured me of any risk of crying because it was so melodramatically right that I just laughed.  Great work  Francine on getting through - and much respect to all who are coping with SEs today.",

My lovely lovely boyfriend gave me 36 presents for my birthday. He said it was because  he had missed the first 35!!

      "Content": "Apr 2, 2009 03:54AM - edited Apr 2, 2009 03:55AM by sakura73 Gina thank you for the G &T - delicious! Well, I certainly spoke too soon when I posted yesterday. About an hour after logging off I suddenly found myself on the floor in the hall way after heading towards bathroom to take a nausea pill. I think I was out cold several minutes. Figured I could not stay on the floor all afternoon so picked myself up and went into the bathroom. Next thing I knew I was waking up again in the bath tub! I have a lovely cut on my forehead from the first fall and a large bump on the back from the second. Rang the oncology ward, they said call an ambulance. I did, on the way to emergency my heart stopped beating (and started again!!) so by the time I got to hospital I was a cardiac case. Stayed in ICU overnight, had the day in cardiac ward while my onco and the cardiologist puzzled. It seems slowing of the heart beat is a rare side effect of Emend, so I can't have it anymore. Boo hiss! I had never fainted before so the  cardiologist thinks either the Emend or the nausea itself caused the faints. I am home now, my father has arrived from Sydney to stay with me, but I feel no further inclination to hit my head on things.  As for staying in hospital - well, my onco makes every one stay in overnight the first time for observation to see how well the nausea medications work. Since I have had this drama and will have different pills next time, I will stay overnight next time too. God bless my private health insurance, though I think to be honest Medicare would cover most of it if I had no insurance. I feel incredibly fortunate to be having my treatment in Melbourne.  Francine I do feel so awful to hear you might have to have more treatments. I hope you find a satisfactory resolution. Thank you to all who offered advice on ports. The paramedics and emergency doctors also had problems getting needles in so the port is now a definite, though my lovely onco said no to next week because my white blood cells will be low. I have read through everyone's posts and send you all much warmth and good wishes. Well done to those doing well, prayers and solidarity for those having a tough time. ",

But I wanted to share one thing she told me in case it helps anyone. I was commenting on the fact that I felt really lucky to have had (so far) such limited SEs. She asked me what my attitude towards chemo had been. I said I had really not thought about it much because my BC diagnosis came just as I was starting a  new relationship and that for most of the last 2 months I had been far too busy falling in love to think about cancer. She said that many studies had shown that the more positive and low key one's attitude to chemo, the more limited the SEs tend to be (obviously there are exceptions to this rule and I am not saying if you have bad SEs it is because you are a stress bunny! Nasharayne  and others, you have had horrible luck). I asked why this was. She said that stress produces cortisol, which produces elevated homocysteine levels. These levels are associated with, amongst other things, worse reactions to chemo. So her main advice to me was to do whatever I can to minimise stress in my life, so as to minimise cortisol levels. Mine are slightly elevated and one of the pills is for that. She said so many women are far too hard on themselves during cancer treatment - worried they are not caring for their families, worried they did something to bring the cancer on, worried about whether they can keep working etc - and that paradoxically that worry makes their fears more likely to come true by increasing their SEs through higher cortisol from the stress.She said we should all give ourselves a break. She also said that people do better on chemo if they think of the chemo drugs as a friend rather than as the enemy. A tough call, I know, for those having such horrible times as I know many here are. But she encouraged me to think of the chemo drugs as my fellow warrior in the fight for good health, not as something to battle against. She said this would make my body more likely to cope with the chemo. I don't want to sound preachy because I know how lucky I am compared to many. But I found her advice really helpful and in case it is of interest to anyone else I wanted to mention it. I am NOT saying that those with bad SEs have brought them on themselves. I would never say that.  It is clearly not the case. ",

Deep envy to those who are finished or nearly finished the first part of their treatment. Love all the pictures everyone is posting. Well, I have a shaved head, and I actually quite like it. My boyfriend shaved it for me (and can I say, he totally loves the effect of it and has been very, very attentive) on Tuesday when my compulsive hair tugging started to bear fruit in the form of handfuls of hair. I did not want to wait around watching it fall out, so off it came. Have posted pics on Facebook - thank you to those who have made such nice comments! Today my head is really really aching but I am not sure if that is because my 3mm hair wants to fall out or because my wig is too tight. I wore it for the first time yesterday as I had to go to court. I felt self conscious in the presence of my client who knew it was a wig (but said nothing) but otherwise okay. I am finding that I prefer my head wraps though. And until yesterday when my boyfriend 'accidently' picked a bald spot into my head, I was quite happy going nude. WIth the bald spot I look like I have mange, so it is head wraps from now on! Pickle - thank you for the good wishes but my next treatment is actually next Wed the 22nd- I get the port put in in the morning and then have treatment. Staying overnight again as the nausea drugs will be different. My brother is coming to stay for the few days after that.  Happy weekend everyone.",

      "Content": "Mar 31, 2009 07:45PM - edited Mar 31, 2009 07:46PM by sakura73 Hello all, I'm reporting in after my first AC treatment yesterday. I got to the hospital as directed at 11 with the lovely boyfriend in tow and was admitted to a private room rather than the day ward because I was staying overnight. Very swish! Then there was a lot of waiting around. I had the cannula inserted around 1pm - first attempt failed, and I was told to consider getting a port. Do many of you have them? I have 15 treatments to go and don't want to have cannula needle related panic every time, but I have read horror stories about ports on this site. After that, more waiting - in the end Damian and I went for a long walk in the sunshine. It was a glorious autumn day in Melbourne. Finally around 4pm I was given oral Emend, decadron and maxilon, and at 4:30 the influsion started.  No problems with the A (I sucked on ice though my onco rather scoffed) which ran through in under 15 minutes, then the C took about an hour and was followed by a 12 hour fluid drip to assist in flushing it through. I also drank at least 10 litres of water. Around 10:30 that night I had some nausea and was given IV Zofran. This morning a bit of a headache which paracetamol cured, and an Emend tablet. I was sent home with another Emend for tomorrow, and Zofran and Maxilon as needed. A friend collected me and we went for lunch.I fear not even chemo can take my appetite away! I know darker days are coming, but as you have also said, it is very doable. INdeed it was a total anticlimax! I have no nausea and apart from some slight heavy-headness feel quite normal. (I should add that after all the advice about avoiding constipation I went too far and gave myself the opposite problem!) I wanted the port put in the day of my next treatment but the only time my BS has is next week. Bit annoying. BUt if that is the worst news of the day, that is okay! A big shout out to pickle and maidmarion - my fellow 31 March princesses. I hope you continue to feel well. And best wishes to the rest of you too as you continue the warrior princess march.  Rachel",

I sang at a Tenebrae service last night which was out of this world. Music can make such a difference to one's mood, don't you find?  Francine, I definitely don't think of myself as sick. I had cancer, it was removed in 2 operations, and I am having chemo to prevent it coming back. That is how I think of it. I did have cancer. I don't have it any more.  I know this way of thinking might not suit everyone, but it certainly suits me, though when my next AC lays me low I might think differently! Sessna1, (and I am deliberately not PMing you given your comment above to Francine) one of my favourite Christian examples is St Francis of Assisi. He once said \"preach the gospel constantly, if necessary, use words\". In other words, let it be your conduct, not your words, which testifies to your faith. One of the best ways to do that is to behave towards others with the respect that we would wish them to give us. I know you know this, I am not saying anything new. If Linda and Francine and others find direct references to the Christian God (and let me be clear - I am a Christian who is spending nearly this whole weekend at church) upsetting in what is meant to be a supportive forum, then perhaps you should reserve your testifying for other places. You have made your faith clear, and anyone who wishes to ask you more can do so. God will require no more of you, and on St Francis's example would perhaps want you to now show a respectful silence on the matter. You can ignore me, of course - I have no special standing here, but as one Christian to another I hope you will take this message in the spirit it is intended. ( By the way, I am sure you did not mean to refer to any of us as dogs, and perhaps you would like to reconsider that part of your post! Metaphor can get us all in to trouble if we are not careful)  ",

I totally hear you all about not wanting to be a patient anymore. I am soooo over the looks from people.  But I have to acknowledge that I am so lucky. Apart from a general queasy feeling (which I did not have after first 2 treatments) AC number 3 has been pretty kind  to me. I had treatment on Tuesday, and by Saturday night I had my mojo back in spades and had a very pleasurable evening with DBF.  My brother (who was ostensibly down here to look after me, but got a cold so I looked after him!) thinks the Adriamycin he saw go into my veins was actually red cordial.   I hope noone thinks I am boasting - I know I'm lucky. I send much love to all of you who are having a rougher time. I think of you all often.",

      "Content": "May 3, 2009 12:44AM - edited May 3, 2009 02:42AM by sakura73 Alyad - I am having Zoladex to shut down my ovaries during chemo, so no more periods for me for a while. I had one about 2 weeks after my first AC but since then the injections have kicked in and the fertility doctor told me I wil have no more until after the injections stop. Apparently women in our age group have about 70-80% chance of periods coming back. Fingers crossed for us both. Buddy -please check in and let us know how you are doing! Cyndi and others - I have continued having sex with my boyfriend since treatment started. I am much luckier than many of you because I did not have a mastectomy and so have fewer changes in my body to cope with. Since I am on Zoladex I have to be careful of dryness etc, but there are ways round that. I have posted a few times on the mojo thread and won't repeat here what I have said there but I can say that I have found that focussing on my boyfriend's pleasure has been a great way to get my own body interested. Nothing is as sexy as a man who you've turned on! My body is definitely not as interested in sex as it was before AC and Zoladex, but I have had some very very nice experiences in the last month for which I am very very grateful. And in fact on a number of occasions I have felt so much better afterwards - less neck pain, for instance, which is weird. I guess it just relaxes you generally. I should say that I have made a really conscious effort to keep having sex, because my relationship is quite a new one and this would usually be the time when we were having sex every day. My boyfriend has been very clear that I don't have to do anything I don't want to do, but maintaining sexual intimacy - even if I personally am not as into it as I was -  is an important part of me feeling that my life is continuing normally. I want chemo to intrude as little as possible into my life. I still want to feel sexy, and though I don't feel particularly sexy bald, I do feel sexy when I hear my boyfriend moan because of what I am doing to him (sorry if that is too much information!) I'm a week and a half out from my second AC. Got a bad cold this week and have had to take things easier than I would have wanted, but apart from that I am still blessed with remarkably few SEs.  Hope everyone has  had  a good weekend.",

You're all amazing.  Special thoughts to those suffering with mouth sores - they are one of my worst fears! I had my egg retrieval today and it was not a success. There were only 3 eggs, and the likelihood is that they won't all freeze properly. When the doctor told me I just bawled and bawled. I had been telling people that all I wanted for my birthday was a small glass vial full of frozen eggs. And I really meant it! No pony for me, thanks, just bits of me deep frozen.  I know there are other ways of preserving fertility - and I am doing all of them - but I was really hoping for at least 5 or 6 eggs frozen, and now I might have only one or even none. $3000 not particularly well spent! Now the fertility stuff is over I am really desperate to get started on treatment. The not-knowing what my reactions to it will be is getting very hard. You're all being really generous in how you are sharing your stories, and I really appreciate it - but the stories also show how differently our bodies can react to the same drugs!  So until I start I can't know what my particular journey is going to be. I add my thanks to gina and M-o-B for all their hard work here.",

Alyad - so glad to hear you are feeling better! I have no tattoos and don't think I would ever get one, though my boyfriend is somewhat encouraging me to get one at the end of my treatment. I think when radiation ends I will just want to forget all about cancer and not have any reminder more than the scars I already have (which are quite funky - and my boob is perkier than it was thanks to my lovely surgeon who added in a lift when she took out the lumps!). I know what happened the last time I posted this but I have to say - I am feeling really really good. Mouth is still a bit off and am swigging Biotene like a gin drinker in a Hogarth etching, but otherwise no complaints. Was even able (and in the mood!) to be of service to the lovely boyfriend last night, if that is not too much information for you all! I think the thing which has helped is the amount of water I am drinking. I am seriously peeing every hour, but it has so far kept me remarkably fine-feeling. Of course, maybe my body feels guilty about the melodramas of last week, or maybe it is just saving it all for next time. Am off to the naturopath now to find out what I can do to keep future SEs at bay. It is a glorious autumn morning here. Hope the sun is shining for you all.",

I pray there is nothing sinister and that all is resolved soon. Diane - how are you? What was the result of the tests? Everyone - I do agree that some people mean well but just don't know how to respond to bad news of things like cancer. I have been fortunate, but there are some people who have found it too scary I think, that their friend/relative \"has cancer\" and have backed off. I hope you have all had a lovely weekend.

I have a new fear - that I have so few SEs because I diluted the chemo by drinking too much water during and after the infusion so that it left my body too quickly. I seriously drank about 6 litres of water each time. I emailed the onco and got a typical scientist response \"there are no studies to show drinking too much water reduces the effectiveness of chemo\" and he told me I could keep drinking water  but 3-4 litres was probably enough. So now I am freaked out that I have sabotaged treatments 1-3 by drinking more than that. Sigh.  It's awful how our minds can always  find something to worry about!",

I had a local and sedation, but it felt the same as a general. Today I am quite sore and I think I moved the shoulder too much because there is fresh blood under the waterproof bandage. But having it gone feels great.  Is anyone else having ongoing arm pain/full feeling on the side where the nodes were removed? My arm is not actually swollen but it feels swollen - I have colllected so much additional flab on my arms and upper body that it is hard to tell what is going on there. A week out from chemo has shown that none of that flab was water retention! Sigh. It's raining here - which is lovely because there's such a bad drought on.

I am one third of the way through Taxol, and some finger/feet pain aside am feeling fine. Hair is definitely growing, though it is white and still crispy-chemo-fried. Might shave it off again. DBF has been heard to say he would be happy if my hair never grew back, but I am ready for some hair, thanks. Karen and Jan  - on  the drinking thing, I am going to keep having a glass of wine here and there. I never drank that much, and have defnietly drunk less since chemo started, largely because on AC I did not fancy it. I think it is too simplistic to single out any one thing as being the 'cause' of what is just plain bad luck. I intend to get fit and healthy, which will mean I drink less, but frankly, if a form of mustard gas is good for  me I refuse to accept that fermented grape juice is the devil's work!

It is amazing how much colder it is without those little 5mm hairs!! I really feel like a chemotherapy patient now. Wore my wig for work yesterday (under my barrister's wig - I don't recommend wearing 2 wigs at once. Very very hot and uncomfortable) and it gave me a bit of a headache because the elastic  is so firm. I think the headwraps will be more use to me. Am wearing one today and getting quite a lot of stares.  On the weight front I seem to have lost the 2kg I thought I had gained since my first treatment. Like some others I am craving fast food. I do a fair bit of walking, though, and hope I can avoid weight gain. If anything I want to lose weight to ensure minimal body fat for estrogen to party on in! I have second AC tomorrow (if counts okay) but port is being installed first. I feel worried about the  port but based on the advice of those here I know it is the right thing to do.  Fasting before the procedure means I won't  be as well hydrated for chemo and this bothers me. I'll be in overnight again since I can't have Emend this time. Let's hope Zofran and Kytril can fill the void. And more importantly, let's  hope the port does  not get in the way of lovely BF grabbing hold of me whenever he wants! ",

For us, that is COLD.  Karen  - welcome! Gina and others - the question I keep getting asked is \"when do you finish?\". They mean the chemo, so I always then have to say that I have radiation afterwards. So the 'finish' date is NOvember, but of course if I do Tamoxifen the finish date is a looooonng way ahead. Because for me 'finish' means 'finish having to be a cancer patient' which is as much a state of mind as anything else.  Janet I also seem to spend a lot of time reassuring people that I am fine and that the cancer won't return. Then I go home and sit in the bath and have a quiet freakout that it will. It is so hard to be really open about my fears, because I don't want to be a burden to those  around me who I know are as scared as I am of a recurrence. I am thinking about having some sessions with a counsellor just to be able to speak all my fears and worries out loud without having to take care of the person I am telling.  I went to a personal training session today. There was one point where I literally thought that death was preferable to doing any further repetitions of the exercise. But now that I am through the AC I have to start getting healthy and fit (can't say 'again' as I was never really very fit before!) because if I am to avoid Tamox I have  to get my weight down. I am noticing some bracket creep around my tummy - the menopausal belly. Arrgghhhh. Of course, I intend to be out of menopause by the end of the year but I am not so naive as to think the belly will just vanish when my period returns. No free breaks on the chemo train!

I do feel my decision is right for me.  On the exercise front I have been really slack about exercise lately but for a while there was going to the gym and lifting light weights (no more than  5kg per arm) using my surgery side.

I think I have mentioned before that I have been warned that when active treatments (ie surgery, chemo, radiation) finishes is often the time when people become depressed.

The onco kept me in a second night to give me IV fluids and ani-nauseas (Zofran and Maxilon) through the drip. No more vomiting so far. So it seems that Emend really is the wonder annti-nausea drug, and I envy those who can keep having it.  Good news is that the port seems to work fine, and I didn't faint and crack my head open! Today I feel back on track - have been for long walk and will now have nap. Then will catch up on all posts and offer comments. IN the mean time, much love to all. R",

It is still really grey on top, but at other places looks a bit lighter than my old hair was. I actually had someone who doesn't know me say they liked my hair cut! I will still wear the wig for work for another week or so, and then be naked for good. It does feel so good to be free of the scarves and wig. I've had a glorious weekend with DBF and am feeling wonderful. I hope you are all feeling so too.",

I do have  private health insurance but the only difference that makes is the kind of hospital I have treatment in. I simply don't see any bills for chemo - either the government or my insurance company pays for the drugs and the hospital bed. So I have no idea what it costs. I did not have Neulasta. My onco does not believe in it. He was right for me - my blood counts returned to normal by the time of each AC. My onco also costs me nothing as I only see him on the day of treatment and his bill is also just paid by Medicare. I  do get bills for pathology (blood tests etc) which are then reimbursed by Medicare and my insurer. Here insurance companies NEVER have any say over what treatment you get. I have been amazed to read on this site of people whose insurance won't pay for what the doctor thinks the patient should have. If the doctor recommends it, you have it.  I feel so lucky. Luv2sing so sorry to read about your Taxol side effects. I have number 2 tomorrow. The bone pain subsided on Saturday. Nails are going bad. Until I read your post I had not really noticed that I am having difficulty focussing too. I got so little done at work last week, it was ridiculous. I hope you notice some improvement soon. It is a sunny winter MOnday in Melbourne. DBF and I had a fight last night and this morning by way of making up to me he suggested that we both take the day off work. So we had make-up sex all morning (sorry if TMI) and spent the afternoon walking in the park and drinking milkshakes. I feel so much  better than I did last Friday.",

Some days I really like how I look, some days I want to hide (today is a hiding day!) but the hair IS growing and I know I will look something like my old self soon. Today is the big show down with the oncologist about Tamoxifen. I feel really nervous. I am not used to disagreeing with doctors and although I feel sure about my decision I know that my reasons are not ones that will carry weight with him. So I am sure I will feel foolish, but I am still not going to accept a prescription. I am on I3C and it is making me pretty achey so it must be doing something to my estrogen levels!

I was 90% positive for estrogen and progesterone (funny how we never hear much about that one!) The same doctor said (when I asked about other ways to regulate estrogen) that there was \"not a lot of science\" in the thinking about good estrogen and bad estrogen - so she is clearly not going to be much help there!  I want to investigate the natural options too, including fat loss since that is where estrogen is stored. And I know there are studies which suggest regular exercise halves the recurrence rate - a  bigger benefit than Tamoxifen, for me.

This board is for all of us, regardless of what stage of the journey we are at. I am really glad to hear you don't need more surgery (save  for reconstruction) or radiation. Janine yes, we can't get pregnant on Taxmoxifen or for at least 3 months after we go off Tamoxifen, as it causes birth defects. We also should not get pregnant for at least 6 months after chemo, and my fertility doctor said really not for 2 years post-treatment since that is when recurrence risk is highest and pregnancy causes such floods of estrogen that it could increase risk. Then again apparently limited studies that have been done seem to show no increased risk from pregnancy. As you say, it is awful that things can't be more clear cut! BUnny and Buddy are you around?

I am an utter snot factory, it is disgusting.  Rang the onco who is filling in for mine, because (a) I wanted to know whether I can still have chemo tomorrow and (b) I don't want to take my bad cold into a room full of other people with compromised immune systems. He was decidedly unhelpful and did freak me out a bit by asking if I was having chemo for \"early stage breast cancer\" (I said I think so - no one has ever precisely told me whether it was early or not) and then saying that if so there is a need to press on with treatment. So one week off would seriously affect the prognosis? That makes me feel unhappy.  My thoughts are with all those recovering from surgery. I have a 5  month check up with the breast surgeon tomorrow. My arm still often feels heavy and tingly, but I am learning to live with it without freaking out that I am getting lymphoedema. Interesting to hear the different experiences people are having with hair.  My eyelashes are growing fast, thank God. And the hair on arms legs and down below is very fine and pale so far. Meanwhile my head is increasingly fuzzy. My DBF is sad about it - he liked my bald head! But I am so glad to feel hair on my head. Alyad hope first radiation goes okay. ",

I had such a crowd of visitors that I am sure the other women in my room hated me. One old woman told the nurses if she was looking for a boyfriend she should try my cubicle because it was full of them! (it was, too - my boyfriend, brother and 2 other male friends). Well done and congratulations to those who are finished with chemo, but of course chemo is not the end of the journey so you all still have the right to feel worried or upset. Mom of boys the 5 year thing is one of the reasons I am probably not going to take Tamoxifen. I don't want to be a cancer patient for 5 years. After radiation is over i intend to eat well and get fitter, but five years of a drug with potential serious side effects (not to mention meaning I can't get pregnant) seems too high a price to pay for me.

By the way - watch out for effexor, I hear the withdrawal side effects when you come off it are really hard. Hot flash club - count me in. Have progressed to night sweats too. I wrote on my blog that I think the term \"volcanic interlude\" is a better way to describe the flashes. They are soooooo hot.

Fingers and toes very painful too (thank you for the tea tree oil suggestion - am doing it!) and body still using steroids as an excuse to EAT EAT EAT.  I went to the funeral of a friend's mother today. She died unexpectedy of heart problems at 71, having previously been treated for BC. First funeral since the diagnosis, and I am ashamed to say that I was far too busy being overwhelmingly scared of dying myself (never had that happen to me at a funeral before - until this year it never occured to me I might die!) to do much in the way of praying for him and his mother.  All those lovely phrases about going into the light, finding eternal refreshment, etc etc are all a bit surreal when you have to think about the possibilty of doing it yourself. I hate being so maudlin and self-focussed, but today I am so so so tired of being this bald fat freaked out selfish person. I didn't need to get cancer to become a 'better person'. I was a much better person before January 22 this year. Since then I just hate what I am turning into.",

I read an article in the papers today which was very pertinent to my situation and I have decided to take the coincidence of it appearing just now as a sign I am meant to do what it recommends.  This morning at the gym I ran into a work collegue. None of my work collegues have seen me bald, but of course I was head naked in the gym. He was really sweet- told me I was looking 'very Sinead'. I can handle that! Much love to all.",

I have 20mg the night before and 20mg the morning of. I do feel like I suddenly put on weight but I don't think I can blame the steroids. I am hoping the onco will tell me to reduce the dose after tomorrow's taxol #3 as I have (touchwood)  have had no allergic reactions so far. Am finding the hand and foot pain pretty nasty but  your swelling sounds horrible. Take cae of yourself. maidmarion nice to see you here! Hope the PET and CT scan solve all problems by showing everything is clear. ChrisC433 if the first 3 nodes are negative why will they take out more? I had a sentinel node biopsy first and 2 weeks later a clearance since my sentinel nodes were positive. If I could have avoided having more nodes out I would have, because the recovery is slower and the lymphoedema risk much higher. I am sure your surgeon has his/her reasons but those nodes do serve a useful function so don't let them go unless you have to!! Just my 2 cents, of course.  Francine it is good to see you back here. Sorry to hear the nurse was such an idiot. I do think that even in the caring  professions there are lots of people who just don't know what to say to people who are obviously having cancer treatment. I went bald to the gym for the first time last Friday - the head scarf thing was getting me down because they got so hot and sweaty, and anyway it would have been obvious to everyone why I was wearing one. So bald it was, and it did feel so much nicer (a good thing because  the personal trainer was making me do things that were downright unnatural! I thought I was going to collapse on the cross trainer at one point). I did feel people looking at me and then carefully looking away, if you know what I mean. I went bald in the changerooms too, and apart from one woman who clearly struck up a conversation with me so she could show some support (the conversation wasn't about my baldness, but you know how you can sometimes tell that people are wanting to show their sympathy?) again people looked and then  did not look. It felt okay. The personal trainer, who is a pert and perky 20 something, said something which I decided to just find endearing. She clearly wanted to say something positive about my being bald (of course she already knew I was, but had only ever seen the scarves till now) and so what she said was \"It is so cool that your head is bald because you can see where the sweat  forms on the scalp! When you have hair you can't do that!!\". Hmmm. That's what I call reaching for the silver lining.",

I am really glad to hear you are done with chemo, though, and heading back to work. As for the gym - I don't want you to think I am the Energiser Bunny or anything! I don't do that much, and I am horrified by how much fitness I have lost this year. But every bit does help, and as you say, the chemo belly has to go! Mine is just gross. But the main benefit of the gym so far has definitely been psychological. What they say about endorphins is true. Still, you have so much on your mind that you should not beat yourself up about not starting exercise yet. ccbaby well done on finishing! Michelle that is wonderful news about your daughter's awards. I hope your son enjoys the camp. Dawn you are always so warm and supportive in your posts. You're wonderful! Janine let me know when you go naked to the gym! (head naked, of course!) I had Taxol #3 yesterday - slept through it, no dramas, and less steroid angst than last week, though I think that was partly because DBF, aware of what happened last week (the Great Icecream Argument) was extra sweet to me last night. Today  I am very flushed but I do remember that happening when I first had steroids on AC. The onco told me I can cut down to 8mg x 2 rather than the 20mg x2 I have had for the first three. I had gained weight since last week but I have decided to blame the clothes I was wearing. Jeans surely weigh more than trackie dacks!! Dayla, Gina how are you both going? And Mom of Boys - you popped in so quickly we couldn't find out how you are! Love and warmth to all. ",

Pickle and others - on the question of depression and motivation - I went for my last Zoladex injection yesterday and the fertility doctor warned me that is very very common for women to 'crash' as it were after the formal hospital treatments finish. She said people are able to be brave and positive while in active treatment but when ostensibly returning to 'normal life' all of a sudden depression hits. She said it can take up to 6 months, and that if it happens to me I shouldn't feel bad about myself for it - it is natural and understandable and it will pass. It sounds like a lot of women here are experiencing this right now. I am thinking of of you very much. Diane and others - well done on the exercise! I had my ninth Taxol today. There was a more experienced nurse there and she gave me the pre-meds more slowly and I didn't have the weird leg sensation. Only three more to go now. Yay. My best friend had her second baby yesterday. I got to hold him when he was only an hour old. It was the most beautiful, wonderful, breathtaking thing to look down at him in my arms. It made me feel so calm. I could have held him forever. I was right about wearing out my boyfriend's good will. He has asked me for some space - doesn't want to be in contact for a while ( we don't live together). He did this after I emailed him asking if something was wrong because he was becoming so distant. We got together right when I was diagnosed and it was such a glorious blessing that I have sometimes wondered whether he was a gift I was given while going through the initial horrors of  surgery and chemo, and that when that was over I wouldn't get to keep him. Right now it feels like I was right. I'm very weepy about it - and I am a messy crier so I look even weirder than normal! I'm desperately in love with him and I find the thought of being without him horrifying, so I am hoping, hoping that he'll want to keep things going, but if this year has taught me anything it is that there are many things I can't control, and this is one of them. If he doesn't want to be with me, if I don't make him happy, nothing I do can change that. So I am forcing myself to respect his wishes and not contact him, and I am not posting on FB or my blog either so that he won't have any news of me that way and will need to contact ME if he decides he wants to know how I am. Perhaps that is passive aggressive, but I figure that if he doesn't want me to contact him he doesn't get to have news of me by secondary means. He doesn't read here, of course, so I hope you all don't mind me blathering on about it! There's spring in the air here today. I send much warmth to you all.",

I am not ready to accept that yet, but perhaps it is true. And either way nothing can take away those times we had, and the support he was to me. I can't believe that the change could occur so fast - when I look back over emails and texts the change really occured over just a few weeks. But I can't make him love me. Part of me feels like I am bearing the brunt of his deep unhappiness and burdens caused by other parts of his life, that he has decided it is better to leave me that to work through the implications of being with me (pressure from ex wife, logistics of sharing custody of son etc). But even if that is true it makes no difference. It was his decision to make and he has made it.  I went to chemo today. A friend drove me, and took me for a coffee between onco appointment and influsion. I cried a little in the onco's office, and absolutely bawled in the day ward.

Jelly bean has grown nicely but the sac is apparently rather small which could be a sign it has not implanted correctly. Usually at 6.5 weeks the miscarriage risk is 15% but the doctor said for me it is probably more like 30% for this reason. Further scan in 10 days, then trip to the obstetrician if all looks okay.

It was fun, though I still spent a lot of the weekend being tearful. But today I feel better. The artist formerly known as DBF has given me a more detailed explanation of why he left. I can see now that there is nothing I could have done to keep him. It is no consolation, but at the same time somehow it makes me feel calmer. I think we will end up being good friends, in time. I would certainly like that and he says he would too. We'll see, I suppose.  My eyelashes are definitely coming back. I hope they are  not going to fall out again. Hair is still grey and fuzz-like.

I have had intermittant aches and heaviness in my surgery arm but so far the physio says it is not LE but just the slow process of recovery. Francine - I had a compression sleeve fitted back in May or so when I flew to Sydney - it was fine then, but was a bit tighter on my more recent flights to Sydney and Singapore because I have gained a little weight, grrr. In fact I took it off half way to Singapore because I was convinced it was doing more harm than good ( a badly fitted sleeve is worse than none) and did not wear it on the way back. The physio said the jury is still out on whether the sleeve helps when flying.I did do lots of exercises while seated in the plane to keep the lymph flowing. Dayla  again - Yay for Auntie Flo!! Alas, she is yet to pay me a visit. I booked my followup MRI, mammogram etc for early February and had  to say \"I don't have a cycle\" when they asked me when in my cycle the date they gave me would fall. I really want her back, though I too also wish I had my Brazilian. Leg hair is also starting to flourish in a  very annoying way. It's a scorcher here today - 43 degrees celsius (that's 109 degrees fahanheit!) and I am sticking indoors in the new house. D and I moved in last week and there are still lots of boxes around.

It is lovely to hear all of your news.   I logged in just now and saw the October 2009 chemo thread and was so incredibly thankful that chemo is behind me. Can you imagine being at the start of that journey now? It is weird being on a radiation thread because to me it seems so minor compared with chemo and yet there are many women there who had no chemo, were only recently diagnosed and are much more concerned about things than I am - they are stressing about things that we all stressed about back when we were starting out. Cancer treatment is so normalised for me now that I have almost forgotten what it is like to be worried about it. I had radiation 17/30 today. Still have no burning at all - I am really lucky I know.I feel guilty that things have been so easy compared with the horrible burns I know some of you  got. That said, I do have some treatment worries - have to make a decision about Tamoxifen and I feel sick about it. Have cancelled the oncologist appointment next week where I was meant to get the prescription  and am yet to reschedule. How are people going on it? I have started taking I3C and iodine and am so tempted to not take Tamoxifen at all. It is silly - I have had such an easy run with side effects from chemo and radiation that I shouldn't worry about Tamox side effects, but I do. As we've discussed before, for me  it is about wanting to put an end to the time in my life when I am a patient. I want cancer treatment to be OVER. And here's a question - do you think of yourself as cured? On another thread I got a bit grumpy at women who were saying BC can't be cured. As far as I am concerned I am cured. I might get it again, but if you have flu and get better you don;t say your flu is in remission - you say it is cured! Even if next winter you get it again. I wonder why we treat cancer so differently. I know it is different for those with advanced disease but for  those whose cancer disappears entirely in treatment (as I know yours is going to with your Adriamycin, NYDeb) can't we say we are better? I would be interested  in what people's views are on this - and I don't want to sound like I am criticising anyone else's  approach.  Dawn it sounds like you still think of  yourself as having cancer. I suspect this is quite a personal thing and we will all have different approaches. Happy weekend, everyone.",

I have just started taking iodine to make sure  my thyroid is working okay. nadine  I too am all about Vitamin D these days. I take 2000 units/day, like Francine.  The other thing I am increasingly all about is natural progesterone. (mom of boys  I am haunting the natural girls thread too!) Have been reading the Dr Lee book \"what your doctor will not tell you about breast cancer\" and can honestly say that I now understand how I got cancer, and how long it must have taken for it to grow. I don't mean that I know why I got it, or that I blame myself, but I can now look back and recognise what was happening in my body was the early signs of  my hormones getting out of whack. I had way out heavy periods back in my early 20s and can see that I must have been estrogen dominant even then. Then I went on the pill to control the periods and that would have just reduced my progesterone even more. In the last couple of years I did wonder whether the pill was causing or contributing to things like hair on my face. And all of those things are signs of progesterone deficiency, and without progesterone estrogen can run amok. Which is what happened to me.  So I am now working up the courage (a) to tell my onco that I am definitely NOT going to take Tamoxifen and (b) asking him or my fertility doctor about a prescription for natural progesterone cream. I know they are both going to freak. But I feel good about the Tamoxifen decision. It is such an individual thing and for me it is not the right thing to take. I am sure of it. I am taking I3C instead and with that and the progesterone I am sure  I can get as much benefit as Tamox could have given me.  Spring is finally here in Melbourne and today is a beautiful one. I feel happy because I have all these tiny new eyelashes sprouting, and only 8 radiation treatments to go! I have a  little aching and itchiness but still no burning. I am really lucky. Much love to you all. ",

Beth P  how was your biopsy?  Moborn -yay for last week of radiation! Diane  that totally sucks about the biopsy and I don't blame you one minute for losing it. You are in my thoughts. Even though you know it will most probably be fine, it is impossible not to freak out. I am glad you are seeing your surgeon, since you have confidence there. I am wondering a lot about my decision to only have a lumpectomy, given that many women here with comparable size tumours (indeed, mine was multi-focal)  have had mastectomies and are now planning removal of the other breast too. I am eagerly awaiting the return of my period and ovarian function - I want the estrogen back. Am I just in denial? Now that I have no boyfriend the pressure to get pregnant is slightly off, I supppose. But I do want children so maybe I should have been more aggressive in my surgical decisions since I will have plenty of estrogen around. I did ask whether I should have the thing off and the surgeon encouraged me to try a second surgery for clean margins first. It worked, so here I am.  On the topic of how many women go through all this - the one in eight stat is a bit misleading, I think - it is one in eight women over 75 or something like that. In my age group (30-40) it is one in 256. So I am the one taking it for the team amongst the women of my acquaintance!! I did get approached by a male colleague - older than I am - who told me his wife is in treatment for it. And by a woman in a cafe who told me her hair was a wig (until then I just thought she had terrible taste in hair dye!!). So yes, there are more around than we think. Beth, thank you for asking after me, and to others who have continued to send such wonderful warmth. I had chemo number 15 today.  Next week is the final one, and also the day I am measured for radiation. For the third week in a row I heard nothing from the artist formerly known as DBF. I didn't really expect it, but it really hurts that I am so vanished from his thoughts.",

MichelleinSJ it is lovely to see you here. Isn't it funny how life takes care of us sometimes - your experience of realising NOT getting a teaching position was a godsend is exactly like some experiences I have had this year, when not getting what I wanted turned out to be better than getting it! Okay, I have some news. I have not told many people yet and some of those I have told have freaked  out on my behalf, but I think the news is completely wonderful. Damian and I are back together again after a long process of becoming friends and spending more and more time together (including, I can confess to you but nowhere else, some friends with benefits hanky panky). I still don't fully understand why he broke up with me but it seems he had a panic attack about the ways in which living with me would require him to change other aspects of his life. He seems to be much more comfortable about that now, and it is he who first suggested that we move back from friends to partners.  I feel so happy. Some friends have expressed their concerns that  it (him leaving me) might happen again, and of course it might (though I don't think it will), but after everything that has happened this year my life philosophy from now on is not to be too careful of avoiding risks. As we  all found out this year, you never know what might happen. I am not going to let the fear of being hurt again keep me from being happy. Just like I am not letting the fear of getting cancer again keep me from being happy. I would rather risk more hurt than risk going without the joy that being with him gives me.  So that is my news.  I hope Monday morning is finding you all well and happy.",

Final session today went very smoothly. And it was a day much lovelier than I could have hoped for because my ex boyfriend drove me to the hospital and had coffee with me between onco appointment and infusion. He had been with me at the first chemo, and at several subseqent ones, and he was for that reason, if no other, the person I would have chosen to take me today. It was a journey he helped me take, and that he offered to drive me today was wonderful. It was a lovely day and we had coffee outside and then said goodbye.  I don't know often we will see each other - he lives a long way from me on the other side of the city - but our parting today was friendly and gracious.   I was meant to have my radiation measure up today but although I told them ages ago I don't want tattoos they had forgotten and didn't want to mark me up with pen and tape because it might come off before start date on 21 Sept. So now I am being measured on 22 Sept and start radiation on 24 Sept. I told the onco I am still undecided about taking Tamoxifen. He looked at me like I was an idiot. I want to keep my ovaries of course, so I don't have that option. I just don't like thinking of estrogen as the enemy. Much love to everyone. Thank you for all your support.

Back in the middle  of the year she was scathing about my not wanting to take Tamoxifen, but yesterday when I explained to her that I wanted to help my body balance hormones naturally rather than artificially block excess estrogen, she understood, and said that was fine.

No period for me since March.  Francine - apparently Tamoxifen does actually increase fertility but it can also cause birth defects so conceiving when on it is a no-no.

Hope your recovery is swift and problem-free. I asked my onco about tumour markers after reading about them on this site. Like you my chemo was  prophylatic. He said tumour markers are enzymes in the blood (or something like that) and that in my case there was nothing to look for since they were confident any measurable level of cancer cells had been removed in surgery. Hope this helps.",

I had an ultrasound today which confirmed mild swelling in my surgery breast secondary to radiation. I was told it will go away in time. The physio did some lymphatic massage last week and I have a further appointment next week.  Well, the mammogram, ultrasound and MRI were clear and I don't have to see the surgeon again for a year! I was nervous because the breast is swollen and sore, but the surgeon said a recurrence so soon after clear margins and radiotherapy would be very very unlikely and that it is just post radiation swelling. I also have a small seroma along the internal scar line which said will drain itself in time. So, big relief.  As for the weather, it is sunny and 35 degrees C (95 F) here today. I enjoyed my walk away from the hospital.",

Let's agree to post pictures... Nadine I have the chemo wave too, which I think is why my hair looks like it has stopped growing.  My eyelashes are completely back but I am expecting, based on what  I have read, to lose  them again. Eyebrows mostly back:  they were never that thick. But as Nadine says, I don't feel quite back to normal. I wake ever morning with really stiff hands and fingers - it is a different pain from the one I had during chemo, so I don't know what to blame it on.  Wish I could join you in NYC next April, but I am looking forward to my  own brief overseas jaunt next week; 4 days in Singapore. It is for work  but it will be lovely nevertheless. LD and I have submitted an application for a house to rent together. I feel really excited about it. It is not nearly so nice an area as where I live now, but we have to compromise as he needs to remain near his ex wife so that they can continue to share care of their son. And it will do while we save to buy somewhere better.  Love to all.",

If having children is important enough to you that you will accept the increased risk that comes from (a) keeping your ovaries and (b) perhaps going off the Tamoxifen now or soon, then you need a doctor who understands that those are your priorities. Complete menopause at 35 is an incredibly drastic option, and from my understanding there is absolutely NO consensus that that is best for early stage women like us, particularly where fertility remains a priority. If having no functioning ovaries was a complete protection against recurrence, menopausal women would never get breast cancer! Of course, for some women it is the right option, but not when we are yet to have our kids. My fertility doctor says there is no evidence that having children increases risk of recurrence and in fact there is some evidence from European studies that pregnancy may actually be protective.  Your DH was a bit insensitive in what he said (if you don't mind me saying so), and I hope you and he are able to talk calmly about this. But your doctor sounds very concrete in her thinking and perhaps a second opinion is in order?",

It is an old Gold Rush town and there are lots of beautiful avenues of European trees and stately homes. We wandered around admiring the autumn colours and planning which house we'd buy if we won the lottery. We also went to a truly DIRE performance of Chekhov's \"Three Sisters\" which was being performed by the drama school his twenty-year-old stepdaughter attends. With a couple of exceptions (and sadly, she was not one of them)  the cast were universally terrible. But it was  so bad that it actually became almost funny by the end, and anyway it was nice to have some time away and alone with LD.  Meanwhile I am still, as far as I can tell, pregnant, though more will be revealed at the first scan on Friday and I am trying not to think much about it until after  then. I have my first annual check up with the radiation oncologist tomorrow. My surgery side does still ache a little from time to time - as if I had pulled muscles in my back and under my arm. I am sure it is nothing, but of course as the appointment approaches  I image her telling me I have large tumours in my back and lungs!! bethr great news on the PET scan. Dayla if you are reading, I hope your trek is going well and your skin entirely better.",

Since we have all lived through it we know she will get through it too, but it is an awful thing. Francine [edited since you posted as I was writing!] sorry to hear about your bad day. Beth P and Nadine I am sorry to read about the continued post-treatment side effects. I too find myself much vaguer and much more easily distracted than I used to be (though if I am honest I was already starting off a low base!) It is both frightening and interesting to realise how much our mental and emotional states are connected to our homones and our bodies. Dawn Japan  is a wonderful place! You should try to get to one of the hot springs areas which are to the south of Tokyo - in Hakone and Shizuoka. I lived in a small town in Japan for a year as an exchange student after high school and absolutely loved it. Well, I am officially five and a half weeks pregnant and have one of those ultra sound pictures of a jelly bean to prove it! So of course it is far too early to be announcing it, and apart from here I am not doing so. I have a further scan next Friday to check that things are continuing to develop, and an appointment with an obstetrician in four weeks' time. The doctor said that it all depends on whether  it was a good egg or a bad egg - and given the recency of chemo, the chances of a bad egg are higher than they ordinarily would be. But for now all I can do is avoid blue cheese (alas!!) and hope  for the best.",

If the benefits it is giving are worth the woes then I am sure you will all find the strength to keep at it, though for me the benefits did not sound like sufficent and so, as you know, I elected not to take it and to try and achieve the same percentage of risk reduction through other means.  For those thinking about (or already) taking a break from the T-train may I recommend some research into indole-3-carbinol (I3C) which is a supplement I was taking before jelly bean made an appearence. It is a natural estrogen regulator, drawn from cruciferous vegetables. I noted some joint achiness from taking it but otherwise no side effects that I could identify. I saw the fertility doctor again this morning and have 3 little snapshots of an 8-week jellybean measuring 13mm (which I think is just over one inch?). Sac still a bit smaller than ideal, but cautious optimism is the order of the day. I have my first obstetrican appointment on Thursday. Meanwhile, my surgeon and oncologists now know of the pregnancy. Deafening silence from the oncologist but the surgeon wants me to come in every couple of months to be photographed. Not sure if that is for my benefit or hers, but of course i don't mind! Absent pregnancy I would be seeing each of the 3 (surgeon, medical onco,radiation onco) once a year, with appointments spread at 4 monthly intervals. ",

Tamoxifen is actually used in fertility treatments - as you say, it has an estrogen effect in the reproductive tissues like the ovaries etc, so women taking IVF use it. Strange the different uses a drug can have. Hope the procedure goes smoothly, and that the fibroids can be managed.  I had some minor bleeding last night and rang the obstetrician in a panic and went in for a scan today. Space Turnip (D's nickname for the baby) is alive and well, so no clues where the bleeding came from. Being pregnant definitely feels more stressful than having chemo etc. But perhaps I have forgotten with time how stressful chemo was.  Love to all.",

Okay, so this timing is a little weird - but this weekend I had occasion to do a home pregnancy test after my period failed to arrive on Thursday. In fact, I did 2 tests. Both were positive. I have to go and do a blood test today to get confirmation, but it appears I have conceived. I'm incredibly conflicted. You know how much I wanted to preserve my fertility but I had accepted my doctor's advice that I should not try to fall pregnant for at least a year after chemo. I am happy that my ovaries have apparently returned to full capacity, but equal parts scared that I'll be damaging my own health AND that it is too soon after treatment to be safe for the baby. I haven't lost the chemo weight or done the other things that will make me healthy. Of course if I am indeed pregnant it  is only 3 weeks or so, and many many many things can go wrong so that I am not telling anyone yet (except you guys, and Damian).  I am scared the fertility doctor will tell me horrible statistics that will make me have to think about options that morally I find really troubling. ",

I know from my own experience that proof that everything is working inside is such a blessing in itself. But an actual baby will be even better proof! Please do keep us updated. You all sound like you are having wonderful summers - I am so glad! The trial ended with my client being found guilty of everything. I think the jury got it terribly wrong, but then I would think that. My client was taken into custody immediately, his wife collapsed crying,   it was just awful. Since then the family have decided that it is all mine and the solicitor's fault and we've both been sacked from any further involvement in the case. I've spent a lot of the last 2 weeks thinking of the hundreds of things I could have done differently in the trial - perhaps none of them would have made any difference, but who can say?  It may be he'll appeal on the basis that I was  incompetent. I don't think I was, but if it helps  him get out of prison I don't care if he argues it. Barristers can't be sued for what they do in court and anyway I have insurance.  But as you can imagine, given the miscarriage and everything I was really really hoping for a not guilty verdict that woudl make some sense of all the stress and pressure that I am sure contributed to the miscarriage. So I have been feeling pretty low.  I've got lots of other work to do but I really can't  be bothered doing it. LD and I still haven't really had a proper conversation about the miscarriage. It seems it is going to  be added to the list of things which don't get discussed (him dumping me last year and then changing his mind is also on that list). In happier, though completely superficial news, am going to the hairdresser today for another cut. Have decided to keep hair short for a while. The curls  show  no sign of departing, and at the present length I really do look like the Queen. Not the look I want.  ",

Here in Melbourne it is FREEZING (well, what we in Australian coastal areas call freezing) and today it is going to hail. I am nearly 30 weeks pregnant now, and the Space Turnip is certainly making his presence felt: he is very very active and some times it seems like he is taking running jumps to fling himself against my stomach! LD doesn't believe me, because whenever I try to get him to feel the kicks Schnerbil suddenly calms down, the little sneak. The newly arrived fat stores on my arse and thighs are large enough to feed the average family, so I am hoping that he is a good feeder when he arrives. Work is really busy: it feels surreal to think that in 3 months I will be awash with nappies etc instead of papers and cases. But a good surreal. ",

It showed that all seems okay; the risk of genetic abnormality is quite low, the baby is in normal growth range and looks healthy. I am not making it super official yet (not saying anything on FB, for instance) but am telling those close to me, and you all feel like you are in that category.

I found that the day of and the 2 days after I felt a bit yucky but after the drugs cleared my system I was able to be perfectly normal and happy so long as I used the Biotene. I should add that in the first cycle the hair loss thing was a big of a drag - my scalp really ached for a few days. Really, in weeks 2 and 3 I barely had to think about the fact of chemo at all. I had great sex with my partner, went to work, sang in choir concerts, lived my normal life. I wish you the same good fortune!",

I'm doing AC-T, but my start date was delayed until 31 March so that I too could do fertility treatment. I have had part of one ovary removed and frozen for reimplanting later, and am right now doing the injections hoping I get a good crop of eggs to freeze. I do have a boyfriend but things are a bit new for us to freeze embryos so eggs it is.  I totally sweated on the arrival of my period, and of course given all the stress it arrived late even though the fertility doctor had given me medication to bring it on! So don't be surprised if you are later than normal.  I'm also going to be on Zoladex which is meant to reduce the risk of permanent infertility somewhat.

I had mine cut to the length in my pic a few weeks ago, and next Monday will have it cut to pixie length. Then the shaver will come out  on day 14 or so after my first treatment.  I think it helps - I have always defined myself as some one with long hair and it takes some time to alter that view of myself. I really like my present cut but am in some ways looking forward to the shorter one. After all, if it were not for the fact it is going to fall out anyway I would never have had the guts to try short hair! ",

This keeps your mouth cool and prevents mouth ulcers. It also saves your taste buds - I never lost them, though for the first few days my mouth felt a little delicate. Water and food tasted fine for me, and am sure the ice was  the reason.  Get your mum some Biotene mouthwash and encourage her to use it often to keep her mouth moist and to protect her teeth - chemo dries up our saliva. And get good anti-nausea medication - the best one is Emend.  As  others have said, it is really not as bad as you fear, so long as you take steps to look after yourself. It is great that your mum has you to help her.",

DUring that first days though, all our bodily fluids contain the drugs, including saliva. I don't kiss my DBF on the lips for the first 2 days, to be sure. I went to an info seminar on sexuality and cancer and was told it is totally fine to have sex if you want to. I have wanted to, and so I have. It is an important part of feeling like I still have my life - chemo has not totally taken over things. We use lubrication because chemo/Zoladex makes things a bit dry. Definitely not as much sex as pre-chemo, but we both feel pretty content. So if you fancy it, go for it!",

One of the hardest things about all of this is the absence of certainty. No one can say for sure that the treatments will work, or that we'll die without them. All we can do  is work out for ourselves what level of risk we are comfortable with, and what level of risk is unacceptable so that the negative effects of treatment are justified.  I start chemo in a couple of weeks. I had positive nodes so the decision was easy. I would probably have done it anyway because I want ammunition in my fight to avoid 5 years of Tamoxifen. I don't want my chances for children deferred until I am over 40. Many others welcome Tamoxifen. I respect them, but I really don't want to take it. Everyone is different but your oncologist can use Adjuvant Online to give you some targetted statistics. Mine did and I found it really helpful. I was told that without further treatment (other than radiation) I had a 62% chance of being BC free in 10 years.  Tamoxifen alone increased that chance to 74%. Chemo alone increased it to 82%. Chemo plus Tamoxifen takes me to 88%.   So for me, 6 months of chemo gives me a massive improvement in prognosis. Decision made. A full 5 years of Tamoxifen on top produces such a small increase that I don't want to do it given its long term impacts. 6 months of hell I can take if it gives me such survival benefits. 5 years of constant low level irritation - no thanks, if the increase in survival rate is so small in comparison. I suggest you make some lists of the benefits and the consequences of each form  of treatment. IF nothing else, it can give you a basis for explaining your concerns to your new doctors. And do use Adjuvant Online if you can. Best of luck!",

I hope you don't mind - am a very late March starter so almost feel I should be in your group too! I am on day 8 after first AC and want to offer you all some comfort that things do get better. I have used Biotene mouthwash extensively, as well as the Biotene toothpaste and gum, and since day 5 or 6 my taste buds have been back and everything tastes fine. The first few days I had very heightened sense of smell (meat etc made me gag) but last night I enjoyed a grilled steak and vegetables exceedingly. Use those nausea medications even if you think you don't need them - I did and have not vomited once, or even really felt more than a twinge of nausea.  Today, apart from some limited underlying tiredness, I don't feel like I had chemo at all. I also wanted to paste here some of a post I made on the March board about my trip to the naturopath. I hope you don't find it preachy. Here goes: But I wanted to share one thing she told me in case it helps anyone. I was commenting on the fact that I felt really lucky to have had (so far) such limited SEs. She asked me what my attitude towards chemo had been. I said I had really not thought about it much because my BC diagnosis came just as I was starting a  new relationship and that for most of the last 2 months I had been far too busy falling in love to think about cancer. She said that many studies had shown that the more positive and low key one's attitude to chemo, the more limited the SEs tend to be (obviously there are exceptions to this rule and I am not saying if you have bad SEs it is because you are a stress bunny! Nasharayne  and others, you have had horrible luck). I asked why this was. She said that stress produces cortisol, which produces elevated homocysteine levels. These levels are associated with, amongst other things, worse reactions to chemo. So her main advice to me was to do whatever I can to minimise stress in my life, so as to minimise cortisol levels. Mine are slightly elevated and one of the pills is for that. She said so many women are far too hard on themselves during cancer treatment - worried they are not caring for their families, worried they did something to bring the cancer on, worried about whether they can keep working etc - and that paradoxically that worry makes their fears more likely to come true by increasing their SEs through higher cortisol from the stress.She said we should all give ourselves a break. She also said that people do better on chemo if they think of the chemo drugs as a friend rather than as the enemy. A tough call, I know, for those having such horrible times as I know many here are. But she encouraged me to think of the chemo drugs as my fellow warrior in the fight for good health, not as something to battle against. She said this would make my body more likely to cope with the chemo.   Stephanie1 we are the same age with same treatment one week apart. Hope you are doing well. That goes for all April gals.",

I got to the hospital as directed at 11 with the lovely boyfriend in tow and was admitted to a private room rather than the day ward because I was staying overnight. Very swish! Then there was a lot of waiting around. I had the cannula inserted around 1pm - first attempt failed, and I was told to consider getting a port. NOt sure I want one, but am booked to get it next Wed. After that, more waiting - in the end BF and I went for a long walk in the sunshine. It was a glorious autumn day in Melbourne. Finally around 4pm I was given oral Emend, decadron and maxilon, and at 4:30 the influsion started.  No problems with the A (I sucked on ice though my onco rather scoffed) which ran through in under 15 minutes, then the C took about an hour and was followed by a 12 hour fluid drip to assist in flushing it through. I also drank at least 10 litres of water. The drugs are very cold from being in the freezer - I was given a hot pack for my arm which was very comforting. The C gave very slight nasal congestion but nothing major. Around 10:30 that night I had some nausea and was given IV Zofran. This morning a bit of a headache which paracetamol cured, and an Emend tablet. I was sent home with another Emend for tomorrow, and Zofran and Maxilon as needed. A friend collected me and we went for lunch.I fear not even chemo can take my appetite away! I scoffed down chicken and salad with no dramas at all. I have no nausea and apart from some slight heavy-headness feel quite normal. I know that the SEs are bound to hit later but so far, so good. (I should add that after taking particular steps to avoid constipation I gave myself the opposite problem! But I would rather that than consipation I think. SO - think prunes, think senna, cos lots of the drugs and anti-nauseas cause constipation). So as we say over on the March forum chemo  is totally doable. Much warmth and good wishes to all starting this week.",

I take myself home on the tram afterwards, have no nausea, very managable tiredness and some limited bone pain. Nothing else. The weekly regime is apparently much easier to tolerate than the dose dense one. I know I am in the early weeks, but really, chemo has gone from being a huge deal (on AC) to just an extended doctor's appointment which does not affect the rest of my week at all.  My onco told me that Taxol was prescribed for me because 2 of my nodes were positive. The taxanes are apparently good for cases where there has been that initial limited spread. What was your diagnosis? You could always start the Taxol and then discontinue if you found it unbearable.

I had people tell me 'the main thing is to managae the depression!' but I have not felt any depression, or when I did it was related to other issues in my life and not to being a cancer patient. I don't think it is denial. I think it is about not letting the cancer - or the cancer treatment - define you. It is about still being the person you were before diagnosis and that you are going to continue  to be. Keeping busy with life, not letting it stop for treatment. But whatever it is, I know it helped me get through operations and chemo and radiation (just finished last week) with only a few down times. My naturopath told me there are studies  which show that the less you focus on having cancer, and the more you embrace the treaments as being there to help you, the less serious your side effects tend to  be. So it can't help to be feeling calm and non-anxious. I am sure you have some dark days in your immediate future - I did have some miserable days during chemo - and you shouldn't  beat yourself up when they happen but I really encourage you to continue as you are doing now. I think too that it is definitely easier to have cancer yourself than to have a loved one with it. I think having to watch someone go through it would be unbearable, whereas I have found that doing it myself was not nearly as bad as the stereotypes.",

It is long, but it is worth it - it has lots of useful tips on preparation. And you are right to be proactive - preparation is power in my experience. My own experience was that I was overprepared - I have a cabinet full of remedies I never needed. My bare essentials were anti-constipation medication and Biotene mouthwash - I used it regularly and never had mouth sores - and also my natural supplements which kept aches and pains away. And during chemo infusions I drank LOTS of water and I used the anti-nausea medication as directed.  I had lots and lots of hot flashes during chemo and satin sheets would have been a nightmare I think! But everyone is different. My skin was not more sensitive. Indeed, most of the time during my 6 months of chemo I felt like I wasn't having chemo at all (I had AC x 4 then T x 12)  Good luck! It feels so awful to be about to start, I know, but believe me when I say you WILL get through it!",

The reality is that the  people who are more likely to remain active in this website are those who are in continuing treatment - for instance, those whose cancer was or has advanced. Those who have been given the all clear and have had no recurrence are probably less likely to be around to answer your questions.

I did AC x 4 and Taxol x 12, finishing on Sept 8 (I am in the March Warrior Princesses chemo group)  and had the port out  on September 16. My onco was happy for me to have it out that quickly as my blood counts had always been fine.  I elected not to have tattoos so have six large crosses on me covered by clear stickers! First treatment yesterday was a complete anti-climax - I was only on the table for 15 minutes and most of that was them getting me into position. I am  using Vitamin E cream but am also going to get a calendula cream after reading about it elsewhere on the Radiation board. My naturopath has told me to cut down on carbs and especially sugars - apparently a low carb diet 'cools' your body which helps counteract the effect of radiation. Anyone else been told this?",

Took them all through chemo too, except the I3C which is new. I don't think I want to take Tamoxifen (have not made final decision - and if I do start it won't be until the New Year) but the I3C helps with estrogen balance. The radiation oncologist was fine with me taking all of them. During chemo the medical oncologist had no problems with them either.  Had treatment 10 of 30 today. No burning yet. The radiation oncologist said that if I don't  have any pinkness yet it means I probably won't burn badly by the end. She said the radiaiton in my case is not focussed on the skin, whereas in the case of mastectomy you have to radiate the skin which is why sometimes those women burn more.  Hope everyone is doing okay!  ",
