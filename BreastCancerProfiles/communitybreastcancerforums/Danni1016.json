I should of all people know better as one of my best of friends died of BC. I appreciate this forum so much already. Just reading others stories have given me so much knowledge and what to expect come what may. I needed to hear from someone who completely understands. I worry about being a burden on my husband and family. I don't want them to suffer. But, you are right, I need to worry about myself first this time. I will definitely continue to use this as a support system and again, I am thankful for the words of encouragement. Danni ",

No one told me, but I'm okay with it as I understand it can be more accurate. It was a solid mass. Everyone tells me it will be fine, but I don't feel that way. I missed my mammo last year. I feel so stupid for not making myself priority. I am having symptoms like shoulder pain and thickened underarm pits. They found a .7x.5mm lump in my breast tissue itself. Apparently, it was an area of concern in early 2014. At this point, I am nervous and scared and embarrassed. I shouldn't beat myself up, I know, but that's how I feel. And unfortunately, I'm not feeling optimistic. My symptoms are classic. Be strong everyone says, but I really don't feel strong and I don't want to be strong. I should be allowed everything I feel without being told, \"it'll be alright.\" I have been so happy in my life the past few years and now this. I know anxiety and worry doesn't help. But, this sucks. Log in to post a reply",
