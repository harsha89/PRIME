I found a lump 6 mos ago, turned out to be simple cyst visualized on ultrasound.  Recently, the area where the cyst was seemed 'thicker' and my Dr felt it too.  She said she couldn't be sure what it was so ordered another diagnostic mammo and u/s.  Had that today and the mammo was normal and was compared to my mammo 6 mos ago and shows no changes and nothing suspicious.  They did an u/s after mammo and it too saw nothing - not even the cyst.  I still feel thicker lumpier area, and the u/s tech did as well.  Could this just be how my breast is now since I'm getting older?  I have had mastitis in this breast on several occasions and have saline implants that are approx 10 yrs old...could it be scar tissue?  The lumpy area is right above my nipple and does swell before my period and seems to go down after although still palpable.  Radiologist said to watch it carefully for change but no need to worry, all tests were negative.  I would not have been concerned in the least about this but then I read some posts on the Not Diagnosed but Worried Board.  There seems to be many people who had normal diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound and then they still find cancer.  Makes me think I should've asked for biopsy!  What would you do? Is it safe to just assume this is the new 'normal for me'?  I have to admit I just started doing regular breast self exams a year ago and that is when I noticed this lumpy area so who knows if it's always been like this.
