    "Content": "ejwilmington wrote: Hello - I am BRCA positive and had a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. It was not a great experience: infection, more surgery, implant gravitating to left side and moving in pocket, etc., etc.. My left implant is still moving around quite a bit in the capsule and I cannot find a good plastic surgeon in/near Wilmington, NC. I am willing to go to another state, but I have no idea who to use. Does anyone have any recommendations for an excellent plastic surgeon in or near Wilmington, NC? I am at the point where I am even thinking of just getting the implants removed permanentaly. Thanks.
