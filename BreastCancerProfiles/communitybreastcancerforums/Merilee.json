The first thing he did was reassure me that they were not going to make my hair fall out, make me radio active, make me nauseous, or burn me. I was a little surprised. He said that the worst it will get is that my top layer of skin may peel like an old sunburn might. I will be evaluated weekly to see if anything needs to be adjusted down and if I have any problems in between he will see me that day. They put me in a cat scan that has the capacity of a computer  lining up the beams so that they do not hit my heart, lungs or thyroid. Pretty nifty equipment. I will get 30 beams of healing light monday - friday. He does not want to start till the 25 of July to give my body time to regenerate itself after chemo. Then he revealed to me that he is a Cancer survivor- Ah ha he gets it Yippy! Two weeks of freedom, I won't know what to do with myself. lol",

You can  them see them on this link and see what they are if you are interested. I think it is important to not think of the rad beams as the enemy but as your   helper/healer. I had to make a similar paradigm shift going into chemo. I like the island of regeneration that the set helps you create in your mind.",

Clairiton taken with neulasta has helped many of us decrease side effects also. Naproxen is the best pain med for skeletal muscular pain. your doc can give you an rx.

I had my results from that in 2 days. It does seem like you have had some hasty advise.  I would strongly suggest getting the biopsy, then making any necessary decisions. I t is a big deal to remove a breast and that should not be taken so lightly by your medical professionals. That being said,  treatment has come a long way so even if it does turn out to be cancer, you will almost certainly survive. I would ask for a biopsy as soon as you can and get it behind you.  Waiting and uncertainty are the worst. Once I had a diagnosis I could make a plan and be proactive, that felt much better. Now, I am as healthy as a horse.",

      "Content": "Dec 29, 2011 05:13PM - edited Dec 29, 2011 05:16PM by Merilee Funny this should come up now, here is something I wrote about this topic on my blog a few days ago. I think people are naturally curious. Most are also very gracious. When my hair was gone, and I would run into people who did not know I was on chemo, not one person dared mention my hair loss. I think for some, it was just to much reality, for others it elicited a fear that many woman have. The fear  that they themselves  may one day have to endure the side effects of cancer treatment. One devistating side affect  is hair loss, another is often the loss of one or both breasts. I remember getting out of the shower bald and breastless one day. I caught a glimpse of myself in the misty mirror. For just a moment I could see myself as a ghost. It was eerie and I said out loud \" Holy shit Mer, you are beat up. \" I replied to the ghost in the mirror \" but I'm still standing mother f***er!\" I realized that I had picked up the sailor language of my late brother who recently passed away from cancer. I laughed out loud and thanked him for inspiring toughness in me as a child sibling. I also notice just how much I looked like him, without my breasts and hair. I have always been a bit of a tom boy but this day, I felt like I was genderless. Just some creature transitioning through this world. I realized that much of what makes a woman feel feminine had been taken from me by the beast. Cancer has a way of stripping you down to your essence, which I found has very little to do with hair and boobs. Loosing my hair and breasts was humbling beyond words. No one ever thinks that such extreme things will happen to them and when you are wrong,  it is indeed traumatizing. Trauma changes your perspective and deepens your thoughts about the way you spend  your life.  I have always been  a nurturer and have mothered many kids in addition to my own. My favorite role in life is that of mother. The thought of my children being orphans  strikes a raw nerve in me that makes me cry every time I think of it. It also motivates me to work hard at wellness. It was key in my decision to take a sabbatical from work and try to tweak out a life that is more in keeping with my feminine motherly instincts. They say that when a person looses one of their senses, that the others perk up and make up for it. I dare say, that loosing some of the aspects of my femininity to the beast, has most definitely perked my mothering instincts. I have also learned that darkness is always balanced with light. This, I love.",

I for one do believe that stress is a factor as I was under a ton of stress for a good long time before my diagnosis. I think it is one factor along with environmental toxins that are in our food and just about everywhere. I have not family history, & no genetic link. The reason to look at causes is not to kick yourself in the butt for not avoiding it, but to try our best to avoid anything that may be a factor in a recurrence.",
