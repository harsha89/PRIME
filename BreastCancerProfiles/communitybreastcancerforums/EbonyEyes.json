There is no history of bc on either side of my family and I had no personal risk factors. However, my mother smoked one pack of cigarettes a day and my dad smoked five. I've read that second hand smoke increases your risk for bc 90%. What does this mean in practical terms? I'm so tired of hearing about percentages: mammo, ultrasound,and biopsy -- 85% chance the lump was nothing. 9% lifetime risk of getting bc which I think is below average. Well I got it anyway. For that matter, my lifetime risk of becoming diabetic was only 6% and I got that too. What does that stat really mean? Log in to post a reply",

The more I consider surgery, radiation, being tested for the rest of my life, etc... the more I think I won't do it. Even if I survive bc I will still be a diabetic with failing kidneys and slowly going blind. Actually, not so slowly anymore. A lady at the health department got me into a state run program that will pay most of my expenses but it only covers breast/reproductive care. It won't pay for the rest of my healthcare and you can't have any kind of insurance while you're in this program. The monthly injections I need to keep from going blind cost $6,000.00. If I sell everything I own it won't pay for one month's treatment. And my doctor says I will be on dialysis soon. That costs about $70,000.00 a year. Private insurance is out, I can't afford the premiums for a policy that will cover all the things I need(even under Obamacare). Even if I manage to find the money and survive all these problems all I have to look forward to is taking care of my mother. We've never been close, she has always been so hateful to me and dementia has not helped the situation. She has become so violent and abusive, she has tried to kill me numerous times. She can not be left alone anymore so I will be with her 24/7. I will have no life of my own. And, no, my siblings refuse to help. It's all so hopeless. I think more and more that dying naturally in God's way is the best option. So -- does anybody know what i't like to die of bc? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "EbonyEyes wrote: Talked to two surgeons. So glad I got that second opinion -- second surgeon is taking a much more conservative approach and seems much more optimistic about my prognosis, even used the word \"cure\". Thanks to all who recommended getting a second opinion! Seeing an oncologist tomorrow. Should I also see a plastic surgeon before surgery? I want reconstruction but will probably wait 6 to 12 months. If I need radiation/chemo will definitely wait. The surgeon wants to do surgery next week. He says this has been going on too long(It's been 10 weeks since I found the lump and one month since the biopsy results) and I may loose the benefit of early detection. I don't understand. Everyone(medical personnel) that I've talked to has said the cancer was caught early and everyone seems excited about it's small size(0.03 cm). No one seemed to think there was such an urgent rush when they were making me wait weeks for tests then weeks for results. Then the hospital delayed the biopsy for a week over a fuss about my blood pressure -- then when they did the biopsy they didn't even check my bp! I know everyone here has much more knowledge about these things than I do. Should I see a plastic surgeon first? BTW, I have two areas of DCIS and one area of IDC/DCIS. Both surgeons said three lumpectomies would take most of the breast anyway and recommended mastectomy, said it would be easier on me(?). So I'm going to loose the breast anyway. Mastectomy isn't a factor. Log in to post a reply",

If the new antibiotic works. I am diabetic and we often get rare types of pneumoia that take a long time to cure. Can patients survive a wait time this long? I know there are medical standards for thngs like this, and for good reason, and that hospitals and doctors are worried about malpractice suits but shouldn't somebody be doing something?

The surgeon wants to remove everything and, in her opinion, I will need chemo, radiation, and hormone therapy. Which makes me wonder how carefully she read my medical history I've had blood clots caused by a hereditary blood clotting disorder. I'm not supposed to take hormones. I almost lost a leg a few years ago because of a blood clot. I don't want to take the risk unless my life is in immediate danger. When I said \"aggressive\" maybe I meant \"invasive\"? This is still new to me and I don't always use the right terminology. I want to get rid of all the cancer but I also want to conserve as much of the breast as possible and have as short a recovery time as possible. And, yes, I'm old enough(63) to remember when radical mx was the \"new and improved\" treatment. There were no diagnostic tests. If the doctor felt a lump, whatever the size, both breasts were removed. There was no follow up treatment either. Or even worse, they took a wait and see attitude until the patient was dead.",
