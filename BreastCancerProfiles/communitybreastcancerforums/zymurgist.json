They'd better give me a sticker or a lollipop or something!   Log in to post a reply",

I'm relieved that they looked clear, but not reassured.  Should I be worried about false negatives?  Get a second opinion?  I just don't know what to do! Log in to post a reply",

I'm 29 and started having bloody discharge a couple weeks ago, and even though it stopped after a couple of days, my doc wanted me to take the express train to mammogram city... she said it's partially because of my family history (aunt and grandma both BC survivors), and partially because I've been dealing with galactorrhea for the last 10 years.  Anyway, it's good to be able to read about others' experiences so that at least I know a little about what to expect. The good news is that I qualify for a breast & cervical cancer program in my state that will cover everything (I'm uninsured...).  I'm going to stop my rambling (for now).  :-D Thanks!",
