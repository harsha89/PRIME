I have been looking up breast cancer symptoms all day yesterday (while at work, and a little bit at home). And now into this morning I noticed that it's still there but a tad bit more redness. It's very subtle and faint but it looks like there are other \"small spots\" around the one small spot I found on my right breast yesterday.  As you can maybe already tell, I'm just an anxious person this slight change in the redness of my breast freaked me out even more of me being one of the \"rare\" girl's in their 20's that might have breast cancer. I will continuously update on this thread. I wish I could post pictures but I have only my phone for now.",

This morning as I got out of the shower I noticed a small red spot on my right breast approximately 2 inches away from my nipple.  I'm at work right now, and awkwardly feeling around my right breast to see if there are any lumps. Thankfully, I can't find any and I'm pretty sure that there aren't any in my breasts as I do self-breast examinations almost every day (...thank my hypochondria for that).  I'm just wondering if this should be a cause of concern, or if I should bring it up to my Doctor or not for when I schedule a visit to get my blood work done? There is no pain, no swelling, and the red spot is not raised like a pimple. It seems to have spread ever so slightly (the redness at least), but I think that's due to me poking around at my breast too much.  Thanks for the future replies! Sincerely, A More-Concerned-Than-I-Should-Be 24 Year Old Log in to post a reply",

It's a very small red spot, and it looks like I just scratched over my skin slightly. My breast isn't tender, in pain, or anything like that either.  It looks like it's fading actually, but every time I go back and look at it, it looks about the same. I will probably bring this up with my doctor next week if it doesn't clear up by then.",
