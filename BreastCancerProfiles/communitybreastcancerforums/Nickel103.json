      "Content": "Nickel103 wrote: I am 3 weeks post radiation treatment today (25 sessions). For two weeks my peeling has been turning into these patches of oozing missing skin. I have been using the silvadine cream and am keeping the trouble areas (on breast and armpit now) covered with non adhesive pads all day. Does anyone have any insight into how common this is? Or how long it will take to finally heal? I feel like my radiation oncologist did not even mention this as a possible side effect, and it seems like most women just have peeling without moist desquamation. So I'm pretty shocked that this is happening and am surprised by how extensive the affected area is. Any insights appreciated! Log in to post a reply",

Update - it took nearly 3 months for total healing where I could discontinue use of silvadine cream and telfa. Unreal! I\u2019m most upset that my radiAtion oncologist at MsK never indicated it could go on so long. As a patient I really like to know what to expect ahead of time, and was really disappointed my medical team let me down here. Hope you ladies are all past oozy-skin now!  I really wish I had heard of that film prior to my treatment. Hope it becomes standard of care soon.",
