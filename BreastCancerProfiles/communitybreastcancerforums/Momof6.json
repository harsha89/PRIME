Okay...thanks to whomever reads this. Log in to post a reply",

There are two types: macrocalcifications and microcalcifications Most breast calcifications are benign. The term microcalcification is often used for calcifications found with malignancy, which are usually smaller, more numerous, clustered, and variously shaped (rods, branches, teardrops). Calcifications associated with benign conditions are usually larger, fewer in number, widely dispersed, and round. In the middle are hard-to-tell calcifications which are often labeled indeterminate.",

There is ildefined hypoechoic probably solid nodule at 3 o'clock 1cm from the nipple measuring 5x4x3mm with no internal vascularity.  This may correspond to the mammographic finding of the left breast nodule.

They can not just fax you the results I don't think. You need to sign a release.  If you want your records call where you got your tests done and tell them you want all your medical records  (reports & images) from the dates you were tested.  As for the Xanax...it is addicting...so I think your Doctor was looking out for you...
