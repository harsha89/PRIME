They tried pills and finally asked if I was done having kids and did the hysterctomy but left my ovaries. After that the problem was taken care of but now I would like to know what they found if anything during my surgery. The problem is since then gyno retired years ago and my local doctor doesn't have any of that info. Finally to my question, What happens to files when a doctor retires? would the hospital where I had the surgery have any information??Yes I do know how dumb it was not to get all medical reports from the surgery at the time.
