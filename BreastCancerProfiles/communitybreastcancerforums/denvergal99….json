But maybe it will be managebale. So far, I have not had any issues. I will take the first day of AC off, and perhaps the next day, just to see what happens. I was expecting the worst with T & H, but haven't felt bad at all. I am going to start exercising so maybe that will keep my body strong. the black nail thing sounds bad, but nail polish can cover that. thanks again for the posts! I am also seeking a second opinion just to see how I'm doing. A",

      "Content": "denvergal99 wrote: hi there, I am new to this forum so please forgive me if I have already touched on topics you have dealt with. I am stage 3A, I have some lymph node involvement. thankfully only 1 side is affected, all my screening tests have been consistent. I have started my 2nd cycle of my 1st round of chemo (taxol and herceptin). Luckily my side effects have been manageble and very mild, I can still work after treatment.  for this I am grateful. My hair is starting to go, but it's very slow and not actually falling out but when I comb it goes bye bye! :-). But I have some hot wigs picked out and ready for it to be all gone. I am concerned about starting AC for the next round. I know these meds can be harder the body. My hair's already going so I'm not worried about that. Can anyone tell me of some positive experiences with AC? or at least not so many horror stories I hear about! I work in the medical field so I amfully aware of the negatives and downsides. thanks!
