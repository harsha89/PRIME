I had consults with two surgeons, dr Rache Simmons at NYP Cornell, and DR Debra Axelrod at NYU. I liked them both and am finding it difficult to decide who to move forward with. Their approach and treatment plan are similar. I will have lumpectomy vs mastectomy depending on results of another upcoming biopsy. Any feedback regarding experience with the cancer centers at NYP or NYU would be appreciated. Thank you. Happy New Year!

So it may end up mastectomy. I should know within next few days.Yes I will want to have the plastic surgeon reconstruction too. Who did you use as your ongoing oncologist at NYU after the surgery? I'm still undecided on which hospital for the surgery... So overwhelmed and I think my difficulty making a decision with this is just a manifestation of how freaked out I am ... And I guess on some level I'm scared of making the \"wrong\" choice, even though I'm pretty sure there is no wrong choice and I'll be in good hands no matter what - but the whole process is scary and feels so out of my control. And then this one aspect of it actually IS in my control, and yet I don't want the responsibility of making that decision, for some reason. I feel like I'm going crazy!!! ",
