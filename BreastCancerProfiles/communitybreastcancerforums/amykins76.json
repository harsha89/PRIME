Monday I called my PCP because i felt the infection was back again, went into office got 30 prescription and sent back to breast care center for routine mammogram/ultrasound. After the ultrasound (she took 67 pictures and many measurements) the surgeon came in and said we are doing a biopsy today! (OK ill admit it im terrified, but remianed joking) SO haflway through the biopsy i feel something warm running down my side. the doctor immediately says she got a piece of something but needs to abort the procedure and i need to see my PCP ASAP due to blood pressure and excessive bleeding and reschedule for december 4. I dont even know whats next I see my PCP Monday Log in to post a reply",
