I have to tell you that if my MD told me to go to a walk-in clinic, I would find a new one. Receptionists are not allowed to give out test results, so I am surprised she did that. You need to speak with a nurse or other medical professional. Nipple discharge IS concerning. One of my friends had it after a normal mammogram and it turned out to be endocrine related. If you don't want to shop for a new MD, please call the office to speak with a nurse or someone who actually HAS medical training. I used to be a medical secretary and I couldn't even given out lab results.",

Whenever I had discomfort with a provider throughout my treatment - general surgeon - plastic surgeon, oncologist and radiation oncologist - I made other providers aware of it. My care is fractured between 2 cities, so either be honest with your surgeon and tell him/her how they made you feel, or get a referral to another one. Once a doctor told me I could have a blood clot in my leg, and he was sort of rude and I said, \"You know you are terrifying me, right? ' to let him know his bedside manner sucked! We have to live with the providers for a long time - Be comfortable. ",

The one thing that has really bugged me about this disease - we lose everything - hair, eyebrows and lashes, breasts and a little bit of self-esteem, and people get hung up on what's on the OUTSIDE of us! Weight gain? Tell 'em - \"Yeah, that means the cancer isn't winning! \" Someone actually commented to me and said, \"I can't believe how hearty your appetite is after having chemo? ' Annoyed to say the least, I responded, \"Yes, because it was pounded in my head I would LOSE my appetite, thus giving the slug of cancer a shot at me, so I made a choice to eat no matter how I felt! \" Now that I am nearing survivorship, I'm eating more because Life's too damn short! God bless you and remember, what's on the inside is what matters - not the superficial stuff. If people haven't been through this yet, how would they know?",

Sometimes when people ask me and are all serious, \"So, how ARE you doing?\" that gets me because of trying to stay positive about this whole thing. My Dad had a great, dry sense of humor and was a lawyer for over 50 years. When people used to say, \"How are you, Carmen? ' He'd say, \"Lousy, but thanks for asking.\" - He said that the reason he said it was because he didn't think people were truly listening to his response - He was also a cynic. It became his trademark. When he died in 2010, we were devastated, as we adored him. My sister gave the eulogy and said, \"If you ask us how we're doing with our loss,\" all of the lawyers from the Bar Association that were there responded, \"Lousy, but thanks for asking!\" I hope that cheers you up a little. Bottom line, you're right. People just say it to say it as a courtesy. Those who really know us, don't have to ask. they know how we're doing and how scared we are all of the time. It will get better. I am sorry you recurred, too. I'd be mad. Feel free to e-mail me if you'd like to chat.",

In my case, it was lower grade and upgraded by the time I had my biopsy. I am on the Stage IIIC side of things. Be thankful that you're okay and be thankful that your radiologist was being overly concerned and conservative. Imagine how you would have felt if he hadn't been and it turned out to be something much worse.",
