My mamogram show some calcifications they recomend to do the neddle biopsy.  The Doctor was not too concern about the calcifications and gave me 2 options wait 6 months or go for it.  I decide go for the needle biopsy. Today  I got a call from the doctor. She said that is not cancer but there are slighly atypical cells and now we need to do a surgical biopsy to be sure that we are not missing cancer. She said that I do not need to worry so much, but I am so scared. I am 44 years old. My mother was 64 when she was dignosis. I do not know what to expect, I do not know what to do. My surgical biopsy is schedule for next week. Please I would like to hear from somebody. I would like to have the right questions to ask. Thanks Log in to post a reply",

Yesteday I went for my pre surgery testing I was told that my biopsy will be ultrasound guide. I did some searching and I know sometimes they do the biopsy with MRI. Who decide the type ( ultrasound or MRI), which is better.I had a needle biopsy last week that show ADH and ALH but not cancer. I am really worry but I count my blessings. I am cancer survivor already but I never see this coming. It is just had a lot mix of emotions (I lose my mother to BC last year).  It's so hard not to worry Thank for listen Log in to post a reply",

I was waiting to have all the information together before post it. in February 2013 I went for rutine year mamogram. During the screen microcalcifications were observe. Radiologist sugest a dignostic mamogram which lead to needle biopsy on 3/12/13 results show the following: Columnar cell hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia. Microcalcifications associated with benign duct profiles. Fybrocystic change. These results lead to surgical biopsy on 3/20/13. 52 gr of tissue were removed ( I think this qualified for lumpectomy) with the following results: Columnar cell hyperplasia without atypia. Fibrocystic change. Microcalcifications associated with benign duct profiles. Changes consistent with prior biopsy/surgical site. I was recommended for the doctor in this breast center a 6 month follow up. I decide to get a second opinion in other breast center in my city. They assest my risk ( my mother died of breast cancer postmenopause) and they told me that my risk is 29%, they do not want to wait 6 month  for the mamogram they want to do an MRI (bilateral) and a other mamogram of the surgical site in a month, also they want to considere tamoxifen as profilaxis. I  do not want to take tamoxifen if I really do not need too ( I read about secondary site effects) also I am  concern with my surgery site thart  is still is healing ( i have some burning sensation off the site, and I feel some hard scar tissue). I have a comming appoitment with my surgeon to discuss this issues.  They do not do any physical examination they just review all my films and results. I do not know what to do. Is anybody  in a similar situation that can share information with me? I want to hear from you. Thanks again Log in to post a reply",
