I was diagnosed a year ago this week with metastatic breast cancer with mets to the lung. it was much information to sort out but even though I am in the medical field the immediate thoughts were to decide on the right med oncologist and treatment facility . Since I needed a biopsy of the pleural lining of the lung. things moved quickly. In a short time pathology determined that the cells of the pleura showed adenocarcinoma and were estrogen positive and Her2 positive. A \"good\" thing (so to speak) since treatments are available to work on the cancer cells. I pointedly asked one of the pulmonologists what the survival stats were..he answered in what I knew were stats in a general sense. My pulmonary surgeon was very upset and put it all in perspective with regard to my estrogen and Her2 status. None of us are like cans of soup at the grocers...we do not have an expiration date stamped on us. As individuals each of us responds to treatments in our own way. I have been taking Faslodex and Herceptin every 3 weeks for a year.....side effects have been limited to some tiredness the day after treatment.....tumor markers have been in a steady range and imaging to date has shown no progression. My oncologist will react to any change with treatment adjustments. Robin I really feel good that my oncology team not only works with me but sees me as an individual. I wish you all the best as you find that special oncologist and take the next step to find out what is really \"going on\" biopsy wise. Hugs, Peg",

A biopsy was not needed because of a pleural effusion noted on a CT of the chest. After the chest surgeon removed almost 2 liters of fluid from the pleural lining of the lung , my O2 SAT returned to 97%. I felt better and was \"ready to go home\". Not so. We talked about the need for a further biopsy other than the fluid biopsy and it was decided that a VATS procedure to analyze pleural tissue cells would provide definite answers. Yep...adenocarcinoma cells...same as found in my original dx ER+ and Her2+. Since the VATS procedure with talc was minimally invasive I was home in a few days....ribs a little sore but Tylenol with Codeine helped with that. Since the hormone and Her2 status were confirmed I was a candidate for Herceptin and Faslodex. I have been taking those drugs in treatments every 3 weeks and Surprise! very little side effects....just some fatigue the day after treatment. Boy was I pleased with that! The docs include TMs CA 27/29 with routine labs and routne heart muscle function via echocardiogram. All in all I was a gamut of other emotional issues from fear of the unknown to loss of the status quo and all that goes with that. Sometime last Spring I asked my oncologist if I could fly out to be in AZ with family...He said...\"Why..not.....you are doing great and you have other fish to fry\"....be back in 3 weeks\". I finally felt free and that I can do this! You will have a range of emotions but please know that there are more treatments available now than there were just a few years ago....and please keep away from those stats they are misleading and become those monsters in the dark that hide under your bed. :( Let us know what you and your oncology team are planning for your treatment and follow up.

I am so sorry if that still is the case since you really need to know his reasoning in prescribing a particular tx protocol. It really takes information re your bx report. Arimidex is one of the first \"go to\" drugs for metastatic breast cancer with cells that are ER+ and for cells that are Her2+, Herceptin is used. Such information really depends on your individual case. If you started Arimidex now as your doc suggests....it may take more than a few months to see results. but it is still working. I am not sure as to why you would need to start Taxol...If I were you I would set up an appt with onc and get your complete picture as to the \"what...why.....and the successes seen with different protocols. Good luck Robin. BTW I have been taking ER+ drug ...Faslodex for a year and stable so far....those drugs are very doable. Let us know what you decide. Hugs, Peg      ",

Your system is in a path of shut down with the extensive loss of fluid shown.. Before addressing the vomiting the hospital needs to prioritize your needs and work to stabilize the situation. Then steps can be taken to correct the nausea after some fluid requirement is restored. If one of your primary oncology team is not available then a trip to the hospital is in order. Once there lab work and quick assessment will be done and you will be on your way to replacing fluid loss in the appropriate way. You will start to feel much better. Hugs, Pegg",

Since my MBC to the lung ..two yrs ago my level of energy has been sluggish and my adrenal gland numbers very low....cortisol, etc. About two months ago during scans it was noted that a substantial growth was seen surrounding the pituitary. UGH! Two weeks ago my neurosurgeon excised much of the tumor via a newer route that did not involve entry into the dura so hopefully no cranial complications. Next step is radiation to eliminate the residual tumor then back to Kadcyla. Surely hope that Kadcyla will be effective as a \"clean up\". It has been a long haul....seems like Iwas a resident at UPMC....looking forward to this next step. Hope that Kadcyla is effective for you, Denise. Peggy",
