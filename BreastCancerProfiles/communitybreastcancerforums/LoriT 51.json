I had double mastectomy w DIEP on March 8, 2017- I got infection was on 2 rounds of antibiotics then was put on Cipro; culture was done -it was not bacterial so plastic surgeon decided to open the incision so i could heal from the inside out Wound is large and still uoen; its apx 5\" long and 1\" wide but doctor happy w how its healing. Met w oncologist this week for first time-got my onco score.-because my score was 28 and I'm 7 weeks post op- there seems to be a rush to start chemo Taxotere and another drug (begins w a \"C\") -my concern and question is Now the plastic surgeon wants to skin graft the wound so I can start chemo because onc wants me to start Im scared of them grafting a wound that still has infection in it as chemo could put me at risk of idk what??? and Taxotere-can anyone share their experience with this chemo drug? I have read this is the ONLY drug that has a risk of permanent hair loss Im 51 yrs old ",
