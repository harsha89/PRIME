I've never been so scared in my life. I can't say that my gut feeling is telling me to wait but more my personnality of wanting to be sure I'm making the right choice. I'm just feeling like I don't have much time. But I'll def. go to Hopkins before treatment. My head is spinning!!!",

By the way, I was 33 at time of dx. Hopefully it's nothing, like idaho said, 80% of tumors are benign, but if indeed it is cancer, a year might make a big difference in the outcome.

During chemo, always bald and was quite shocked to find out that I was the only woman in that place not covering her head. I went for comfort, my own comfort instead of someone else's comfort level.

I'm getting my port installed next Wednesday, Dec 3, so depending on treatment, I might be able to start chemo on Dec 4, which would be perfect since second round would be due the day after Christmas, so I'd feel better by Christmas than hubby can take care of me & the kiddos for a week (Christmas shutdow at his work). Meeting back with the oncologist on Dec. 1 to make final decision on treatment, I keep going back & forth and don't know which one to do. My options are: his recommendation AC 4x + Taxol 12x or option #2 T/C 6x. My oncotype was over 50 which is the reason why he's recommending ACT, but HER- & ER+ makes TC a valid option for me as well. Not too excited about the idea of adriamycin. If TC, I can start Dec. 4 if ACT, I'll have to wait for all the scans to be done. Any input on this decision? As far as Christmas trees goes, we ask onc about it since it's very important to us. His words were that it's not a big deal, it would have bigger issues with me hugging & kissing everyone at Christmas than getting a tree. He's a common sense type doctor. With that said, we'll be getting a tree, I'll put the ornaments on, then stare at it from afar (couch!) and when it's time to take it down, hubby will do it all on it's own, making sure to clean the area well after. We've always had a real Christmas tree, it would be rather depressing for us to get a fake one. Until then, Happy Thanksgiving Y'all :)",

Then again, it would make for a great reminder. I did talk to one of the nurse and she says that ibuprofen is fine. A few years ago, I used to have bad pain in my knee and I found that Aleve was the best pain killer for that pain. She gave me the ok and it seems to be working well.

So if I can't take V-C, then why should I take the neulasta shot? Doesn't it goes against the chemo as well? I'm just very curious and plan on asking the nurse today when I meet with her. Tip for scarves, wear long earrings. I saw that somewhere, and it really does take the emphasis off the scarf, dresses your hear a little more and \"looks\" like hair. The colorful beaded earrings are perfect, while they're not something I typically wear, I just got a bunch of them in different colors. Bold, have you shaved your hair yet? I can't remember.

First tx is was 9.6, now 8.6, I'm wondering if it will keep dropping with each tx. Good luck to tomorrow ladies, second time around is a lot easier :) Oh, is there a lot of bald people in your chemo rooms, or most people cover their heads?

She said as soon as I was done, you really don't want to keep it in longer than you need. The risks of clotting (I think that was clotting) within the first 6 months is something like 6 in 1000, but to keep it a year she says it becomes 6 in 100! Also, it needs to be flushed every month. Keep that in mind while chemo will be LONG done, you'll have to keep going in on a monthly basis (while paying them everytime) to have it flushed. She said it's easier (and safer) to take it and put on back in if ever needed.",

This is so odd and was not expecting to be feeling that way so quickly. Not going to complain though ;) As far as financial goes, ladies, check with your hospitals! I just found out that my hospital had a charitable organization (wish I would have know before paying some bills, but I guess they don't advertise it too well unless you say something). Well, we applied and qualified for 100% adjustment on ALL our hospital bills for the next 12 MONTHS! Also, they told us that if we show the approval letter to other providers, they might accept it. She said most do, but not everyone. So, I called the chemo & radiation offices and they both said, fax us the letter and we'll take care of it. I couldn't believe it. $1500 worth of bills erased in the matter of 5 minutes worth of phone calls. I also found out that no copay for any of those places for 12 months, so all my 3 months follow-ups are FREE :) Usually $25 copay. Like I said, wish I would have know before we put over the first $1500 this year :( So check with your hospitals, they might have a similar program. I would have never known if I hadn't asked about the possibility of a $25 copay for each of my 33 radiations! Phew.",

No screening tool is perfect but right now mammos is the only one insurance will pay for. MRIs are known for better results in dense breast which younger women tend to have. It's definately raising an issue but I think they should start discussing other screening tools. How about alternating between all 3? That way, every 3 years, you get a different type of screening.",

Of course, I could ask to see them more, but I'm not worried and it actually caused me anxiety last time I was in, so as long as I'm feeling great with no worries, I'm happy not going to the doctor :) I guess every doctors is different.",

She said that the bone stuff isn't always as easy and sometimes they need to send it away to get second opinions. I figured, I'll give them a week, then call. The fact that my new dr really is a pediatric orthopedic surgeon doesn't help with all the waiting since he only does roughly 1-2hrs/week at the Cancer Center to see adults. But I like him, surgery might be slightly sooner if I was going to the first guy, but I didn't like him anyhow, so I'd rather wait a few more days and be comfortable that I'm in good hands.

Firni, I'd love that cranberry sauce recipe, no hurry to get it on time for Thanksgiving, but I usually just do the recipe on the back of the back, cranberries & sugar. Here's an easy pie crust for you, it's the OLD crisco recipe that they use to print on the containers, they've changed it so that it's \"healthier\" haven't tried the new recipe. This one is tried & true, I grew up on it. 2 cups flour 1 cup crisco 4 tblsp water pinch of salt The way I make it, I throw everything in a food processor (I hate mixing dough by hand) and pulse for about 20 seconds? maybe more or less, whenever a big dough ball starts turning around I stop. The problem with doing it with the food processor is that it makes for a VERY soft dough. So I wrap it in plastic wrap and chill it for at least 15-20 minutes, then it rolls perfectly. It makes enough for 2 layers of crust (1 apple pie or 2 pumpkins). At Christmas time when I make my meat pies (about 9-10) I make all my crusts, by the time I'm done with the food processor, the first one is ready to be rolled. Carie, what a blessing your children are helping out with the meal. So will mine, but at their age, it's not a blessing, more like a chore ;) Heading out for errands in a bit, hoping to get the rest of my food before Walmart becomes a mad house!",

Bonnie, glad to hear things are slowly getting better, sorry to hear about it all. So... WHY? WHY? WHY? Do I have to keep going through those scares? First, my tail bone decided to become crooked overnight causing excrutiating pain, mimicing spine mets, then my foot having unexplained pain, now my period are acting up, so weird that when I went to my OB last Friday, she did a uterine biopsy on the stop to be sure it's not cancer :( Still patiently waiting on those results and I need to get an ultrasound to check my ovaries next Friday. C'mon.. enough is enough! I never went to the dr before cancer and now I keep getting all that weird stuff going on. She is also checking my hormones. So options are, cancer, act-upped hormones or just a weird unexplained problem. If everything is normal, she's thinking about doing an ablation where they burn the lining of your uterus and she would have to tie my tubes just in case. Even though we've dealt with infertility since we've been married, I'm not sure I'm ready to completely close that door yet, there's still hope :) Anyhow, I'm giving them until Friday to call me with the results, they said 7-10 days. It's a different place then with my breast so I have no idea what their time frame is, but Friday morning, I'm on the phone! Well, Bold, I hope your check-ups went well.",

But I'm glad to hear you're doing better everyday. Texas, do you have a PCP that would be willing to order those tests for you? Vitamin D is even more important in the Winter because you get it from the sun and let's face it, we're usually inside in the warmth of our house in the Winter. But see, I know that, and for some reasons I still haven't started taking it. I really just need to head to the store and buy it! I finally got the U/S this morning. They said 48 hours for the report, so if I don't hear from my OB by Tuesday, I will give them a call (even though my follow-up is in a week!) I did get my CD with the pictures, of course, I don't know what to look for so I'm thinking for sure there are a few suspicious spots, but what do I know, I shouldn't have plopped that CD in my computer! Luckily, she did the pelvic U/S, made me empty my bladder before she proceeded with the intra-vaginal one. One more week and I should have answers :) Here's the sad part, procedure at that place is to show your ID to prove you are yourself, well, I have had so many tests done in the past few months that the guy now greets me with \"Hey, you're here again!\" and when I showed him my ID, he told me not to worry about it!! Now, that's bad! Wishing you all a wonderful weekend :)",

Well Divas, it's my turn, yet again, to be freaked out :( I had a follow-up U/S on my cyst on Tuesday. My OB called me back with the results within 2 hours of me walking out of there, not good :( Still there, but more prominent this time. She wasn't happy that they didn't take measurements, so we don't know if it's smaller or bigger, but it looks worse so she wants me to get an MRI right away, with contrast :( So Monday is MRI and wednesday I meet with her. She has also made it clear that no matter what the results are, she wants it out so I'm a little panicked. So my deciphering of what she said is - she believes it's cancer and she's doing the contrast MRI to see if there is anything else. Arghhh... I'm soooo tired of all those medical issues, seriously, I've lost track of all the MRIs, scans, X-Rays... I've had done since dx. It's not even funny anymore :( :( :( I'll update you all on Wednesday.",

Then as she walked in her house, her dr called her with the results, 2 cancer tumors in one breast :( Quick diagnosis, but geez, a week prior she had a happy normal life! She is getting a mastectomy this coming Monday. Hopefully she will be well enough for our visit 9 days later, I really don't care about her being a good host, I really just want to hang out with her and chat, it would have been nice to have a best friend to talk to during that time, I'm just so sad that we live so far apart now. Argh.. she's only 37, wonderful husband and 3 beautiful children. It's tough for them, they older than mine were and they still remember me going through it, one the bright side, I'm a survivor, so I'm hoping it's giving them hope about their mama. She's been my best friend since we met 24 years ago, this is hard :( As far as me, I enrolled in school! Going back to get an accounting degree. Scary, but it will help us get a better education for our children and save for retirement. Exciting, but scary.",

I kept shaving, getting rid of the white fuzz and making it look more uniform, so when I did my last shave, a week later, it was about 1/8\" tall, dark and pretty uniform. Now for some odd reason, on day 18 after my last chemo, it ALL fell again :( So I'm back to square one where the white fuzz will grow first. My reason for going bald was discomfort, the more I went bald, the least I could handle wearing something, even a plain scarf. There's no way I could wear scarf throught the growing process, especially that Summer is around the corner. What I plan on doing is letting it grow, than when it goes out of hand, giving it a shave, but longer shave everything. We'll see...",

So... while he had suggested the TC on our first visit because of his aversion for A, he is now suggesting AC+T because of such a high score. He says that I can still do TC if I wish, but would be 6 treatment instead of 4, but he really recommends ACT. I'm so scared of the heart risk & leukemia involved with A, I'm just at lost, and have no idea what to decide. He has such an aversion to using A that if he recommends it, I'm thinking that might be what's best. Now I have to decide what's worst, BC recurrence or heart failure & leukemia? He also talked to me about this trial they're doing on this new drug Bev. but they have no idea as to long term side effects. Didn't have time to look into it yet, but thinking no on that, would be given only if I'm agreeing on ACT. He is agreeing that A works best on HER2+ so TC might be all I need, but my oncotype score is so high. Then, the tiny positive node they found.. he says that 0.2 cm is the smallest size for a positive, but because it's there, BS might want to do a full axilliary dissection, or rad onc might just do the axilliary radiation, so I have to meet with the rad onc again, and more decision to take. He says that since they found it and we know about it a 3rd opinion won't change that the information is there, but it's already been sent. My head was spinning when we got out of his office, my 15 minutes appt slot took almost an hour! I really like my onc, but geez, I thought I was done with the bad news!

My MIL got mad at me the other night when I said that I have cancer, she said \"no, you HAD cancer!\" I kow most people think along her ways, but like I told her, if I HAD cancer than why am I doing chemo & rads? it's to get rid of all the tiniest cancer cells that are/might still be in my body therefore, even though the main tumor is gone, I STILL have cancer otherwise there is NO way I would be putting myself through this knowing that I HAD cancer. So I'm thinking that my 1 year anniversary should be at some time in June when I done with rads and not Oct. 24th when I had the tumor removed only 6 months out of tx.

She had until now refused to see me bald, I never pushed until it got warmer and told her she would have to get over it. So that night, I decided she would see it, I purposely didn't wait to remove the scarf and drove by her car. The next day when she talked to hubby, she told him that she saw me bald but I didn't know about it ;) LOL! She said it wasn't as bad as she thought, so I was night walk completely bald into her house, her first words were \"you little brat\" hahaha, but she did fine.",

Hubby and I are looking to get an older VW camper to take the kids on a fun vacation when tx is all over. Today is a HAPPY day  What a great birthday gift.

Yes cancer was removed in October, so if it was all removed than why the chemo & rads? So I told myself it was remove all cancer left and the last tiny bit will be removed with my last radiation. That's what gave me the strenght to go through all this, thinking it was removing ALL that was left instead of doing chemo/rads JUST IN CASE there's anything left. It didn't make any sense to me to put my body through all this for 6 months just for the fun of it because they took it all out with surgery.

I'm actually glad I never cut since it doesn't need as much shaping now. Even though my hair grew through chemo, I kept shaving because it was the fuzzy stuff growing. By the time I finished chemo in March, I think the fuzz part was about done so real hair started growing. Been doing the barrettes since October, headband still looks bad! Hubby & I are going away for a week for our 10 year anniversary this June, so I'm waiting until then to get a cute cut and look great for our second honeymoon :) Quite honestly, I'd rather be dealing with the lack of hair right now. Chemo did a number on my liver, I can't seem to be handling wine like before! LOL! I know, I shouldn't even be drinking wine, but I'm French, there's no way around it, I'll drink wine till the day I day ;) My liver does seem weaker though. And I have a bad case of cording right now. Started therapy this past Friday. I love my therapist, she's the best and it's already helping a lot. I spent 3 weeks with a bent arm before I couldn't stand stretching it. The good news, I found today, is that when cording goes all the way to your hand, you usually can get rid of it for good. But now fun, at one point I couldn't even do laundry or dishes! Wearing a sleeve right now. My breast is still sore, not much but enough that it can get worrysome, but I try not to think about it. While we're all out of the tunnel, it will still take a while before our bodies than be back to before chemo :( But... WE'RE ALL ALIVE :) And that's what matters.",

I can't really go past 3 glasses (not that I need more!) So I really can't complain too much. Bonnie, at least you weren't a big drinking to start with. I just can't drink water with a good meal, I would be a mess in your shoes! LOL! I'm finally ok with the look of my hair. Seems like every month or 2, I need to come up with a new way to fix them and I always manage to find something that looks good. The short-short was challenging, I dyed them until I got close enough to my natural color and haven't put any dye in my hair since July or August. At this point, I no longer feel the need to shape it to look better. I'm so glad I'm past that stage. And yep, super curly as well, people can't believe it! Whenever I straighten them, it's twice the lenght! I did cut my bangs so that it would be nicer & straight, that helped a lot. Now going for the lenght. I was going through old pictures last night and I was so sad looking at my long nearly straight hair :( But if it's curly now, I'm hoping it will stick with the lenght, I always wanted curly hair :)",

I called last week to check if I needed a bone scan before going in, they said no. So I went in today, checked the CT-scan and, he thinks it might be osteoid osteoma, but he's unsure, so he says... \"Well, sometimes those thing show better on BONE SCAN!\" Urgh! But at this point, after 2 $25 copays, and still knowing nothing, he says he can't really do anything for me, so he's refering me to a bone specialist who will know what's going on (so he says!). He's pretty sure it will need to come out, I want it out anyhow, it was so painful over the weekend that I could barely walk. He is still sticking to the no cancer but with the history better safe than sorry, if it comes out, the bone guy is the one that would perform the surgery. Waiting to get, yet, another appointment! The creepy part is that the bone specialist is at the cancer center I was being treated, so I will have to keep breathing and not panic that I'm in that place for a bad reason. I have never been so frustrated with doctors & testings before, initial visit & x-ray was 6 weeks ago! I'm not stressed about it anymore, just in pain and thinking it would have been a lot easier to deal with this this summer, not sure what I'll do with a cast having to drive & pick-up my kids to school everyday (no school bus!)",

I finally got an appt with the other guy and guess what... he wants me to get a bone scan! He was going to see me next Wednesday, he works at the children's hospital here, but once a week for an hour and a half, he sees adults at the cancer center! But I'll be away visiting family in Canada, plus I have a wedding to attend, so I'm still going and I won't let my foot ruin my vacation. With that said, next available date is September 8th! At least he wants me to get the scan before going in! So, I'll be getting my bone scan when I get home. At this point, they better tell me something and make a plan of action before there isn't any other test I can have done!",

Had my mammo in October, they called me back 3 times for more pictures!!! Ouch! I think the final count was 11-12 squishes, my breast was hurting for about a week after :( They found some calcifications so I have to go back in 6 months for another mammo and U/S to see if it has changed. Ughhh.. Does that mean every 6 months until something happens? Geezz.. I was so looking forward to moving to every other year mammo, not going to happen for a while :( In the mean time, I found out my cousin passed away a few days ago from cancer, 63 years old :(I didn't know her much since she was much older than me (my dad was a surprise, so my cousins on his sides were his age). She played  and did voices in several children's TV show when I was little, so my memories of her are mostly when we were little and she would do the voices for us at Christmas parties, so this makes it even harder that she passed this time of year. Am I the only one finding it more difficult when people die of cancer rather than another reason? Through the grief, everytime, I can't help but to think it could have been me, people do die of cancer. And even though I feel very blessed and lucky to still be hear, it still scares the sh*t out of me and it takes me a week or two to get out of this mood. I hate cancer!! And then that Christmas shoe song keep coming on the radio, can't listen, radio gets turned off every single time, way too close to home, I want happy jolly Christmas song this time of year ;) Tough week :(",

LOL! I was so looking forward to getting the tree, well, couldn't find one on Friday night, got one last night, hubby had to mess with the Christmas lights for more than an hour to try to find the burned one, couldn't find it. The whole process took more than 4 hours, never had such a hard time putting up a tree, of all years! But now it's all nice & pretty. Tonight, we'll be having a really nice dinner with wine, this might be our last one until chemo is done. I don't know how I'll be feeling and what kind of food I'll be able to eat, so I wanted to make sure that we'd have a nice night before this all start. Dreading tomorrow, I'm suppose to tell onc which chemo I want to do and I'm still not sure! I had decided on TC, but after a few things people have said, I might actually benefit more from AC+T....

A week into my first tx, someone told me I looked great to which I answered \"I might look great but I still feel like crap!\" oops! Cat, the top of my head was very painful and was the biggest reason for me going bald around the house. Everyone uses a pet roller, you can use tape, big shipping labels.. anything sticky BUT NO WAX to get the stubble out. I found that whenever my head would hurt, I would \"tape\" it and it would feel better. Since they're stubble, you can't really pull them. msbusdriver, DON'T USE WAX. When I went for the LGFB program, I asked her about waxing my upper lip which is beyond due but never got around to do before tx, she said not to use wax. With tape, you remove what's falling, with wax, you pull hair and it might irrited your skin pretty bad. I would use an electric razor before I would wax. Just my opinion. Well, I figured out that my dry scalp is really a rash :( The top of my scalp is dry, but the back of my head from ear to ear is a rash. Red little bumps all over that itches pretty bad. I got a tube of hydrocortisone yesterday, it's barely helping. Called the onc on call last night, she said to try benadryl cream and if that doesn't work, to go in on Monday to show them my head. No fever, altough after telling her no, I took my temperature to find 99.5F! My hopes are in benadryl or it will have to wait till Tuesday as I'm going for my citizenship test on Monday and driving my parents back to the airport after.

Well, even with a fan I sweat at night and don't use a sleeping cap. Apfuentes at 34, you should go back to normal, it will usually put you through menopause if you're close enough to it. Mary5454 I had a nasty rash & welts last cycle, it cleared with steroids, so hopefully yours will too. Sorry you're itching :( I have my typical fatigue right now and no desire to eat. Still do, still gaining weight. I'm so bummed because I was working so hard to lose weight before dx, I managed to lose 10 lbs and I've officially gained it all back and don't even care. Still have 3 rounds to go, I sure hope I don't gained an extra 10 lbs, I'll be heavier than hubby :( I also get very anxious during the first week, I just start worrying. How will they know that cancer is all gone when chemo is done, what if, what if, what if and I just start panicking over it! I do have an appt on Feb 3rd to find out if I'm a candidate for proton beam radiation. Still don't know how I feel about it, still a new method, but it seems to be more effective and better on your body. They're opening the biggest center in the world (they say) in Philly by the end of the year, I don't know that I would want to wait that long to get my radiations done and I don't know that I'd want to be treated else where, the course of the treatment is just as long, I can't picture myself in a hotel for 6-8 weeks and having someone to take care of the kids for that long. Cancer is frustrating!!!! Well, ready for a little nap :)",

When I first met with the onc, original plan was 4 TC, then it got switch to 6 TC when oncotype came back so high, but then found out oncotype isn't valid since I'm really triple neg. Right now, I have no idea why I'm doing 6 TC. Going in for #5 on Monday. I think I'm having a hard time thinking about that fact that with plan A, I would be done and I'd be moving with rads. I'm so tired too, not getting enough sleep. I lashed out on my blog last night about everything I'm tired of. I've been bordeline crying for 2 days.

I was telling my MIL that I wasn't feeling very social lately, but then I just realized that I'm just plain tired a talking cancer so I'd rather be anti-social! Picked up my mom from the airport again on Friday. She's been great, she flew (and she's terrified of flying!) here for every tx to help out with the kids, cook & clean for a week while I'm fatigued non the couch watching movies. Met with onc on Fri morning and was expecting the same \"see you imn 3 months\" that everyone is getting. Well, I was so bummed to get a \"see you in 3 weeks to discuss Tamoxifen!\" :( I thought we had already agreeded that I wasn't going to take it. I LOVE my onc, he's great, explains everything and hasn't pushed anything on me that wouldn't have been in my best interest, but he's a little forgetful. I asked him about my port removal to which he said \"I'm glad you reminded me!\" then asked him about starting rads, to which he replied again \"I'm glad you reminded me!\" So going back in 3 weeks (because I'm a good patient) to tell him that I am NOT taking Tamox. Need to schedule my port removal tomorrow morning (he says 2 weeks :), then schedule an appt to get started with rads process, then head out to my LAST chemo! WOOHOO!!! I made it :) Hair still growing, getting thicker and more uniform so I'm about ready to let it grow for real. Thinking about giving it a last shave on April Fools!

I woke up last Monday with my coccyx (tailbone, hubby didn't know what a coccyx was!) being in excrutiating pain, I could barely sit down of all day. After a week and a half, it still hurts, not as bad, but still. My first thought was to check online for a link with cancer! This is a slight possibility that could be rulled out with an MRI. The kids have been through enough, that I'm not talking about it, but they start school next Monday, so I'll be going to my PCP next week & demand an MRI. I'm not that scared about it, but it's still in the back of my mind. NOTHING happened to have caused that pain and I've never had that before. That was my onc. told me on my last visit, use your common sense, if you do gardening at the beginning of the season than, yes, you;re back will hurt, but if pain happens with no cause, get it checked. I have so many doctors appt to make that I'm waiting to make them \"in secret\" as to not worry the kids and go during school hours. Well, I'm suppose to go visit my MIL's friend tonight, she's still in the hospital. She has word of lung cancer now, so who knows what is going on, but definately cancer :(",

It's great! I went to visit my MIL's friend in the hospital yesterday, she's at Hopkins. Turns out she has lung cancer but there's nothing in the lung, it's located in between both lungs and wrapped around her oesaphagus & trachya (I'm sure these 2 are mispelled). With the location of the tumor, they can't operate and remove the tumor because it's attached to essential organs. Can't remember the exact name of it, it's small cell something carcinoma. She's stage 3b, no lymph nodes & no mets. The doctors did tell her they were going to cure her, but she's in for a ride. She has a port & feeding tube installed on Monday, she can barely eat because of the pain. She's starting radiation today for 6-7 weeks and starts chemo next Tuesday. Again, can't remember the names, it's different than with BC but it's some nasty one and she will be very sick from it. With that said, she's doing great and is very optomistic through all this. Cancer sucks! As far as my tailbone goes, I'm starting to be a little worried. I had an x-ray done this morning, and the tech said it's perfect, nothing wrong with my tailbone and to go ahead with the MRI. I was hoping it had been misplaced somehow. Getting the MRI with & without contrast next Wed, they're obviously very fast at getting the results and hopefully I will hear something before next weekend. Here's my update. Simvog, congrats on the clean colonoscopy. Now off to lunch, I'm starving :)",

When I asked him what the symptoms would be, he pretty much said any pain unrelated to any activities/bumps/fall. So if my back was to start hurting for NO reasons, then go back and see him. He said I would be the best judge for it rather then all those tests, it was actually refreshing to see a dr who wasn't trying to make money off me by ordering unneccessary test! And let's face it, all those MRIs, CAT scans, PET scans.... aren't good for you to keep getting them all the time. We've all already put our bodies through more than it's happy, let's not push it.

Which end of the foot is it? Toes or close to the ankle? I have finally found the PERFECT garment for my foot, they're not cheap, custom-made by Juzo. They're exactly like the one you had told me about last year, but it's a thicker material and they don't slip much of my foot and offer more compression. After insurance, they're about $100 a piece, luckily last year I had met my OOP so I didn't pay for them, but I wish I would have figured out they were my favorite, I only have 4. But at some point, it's a medical device not some luxury item, so I'll have to get more. I hope you're able to fond some relief.",

Yeah, I love my hospital, they really are non-profit, the make $0.01/year, so they say. Which isn't hard to believe knowing that they're really out there to help out people. I'm sure the drs all make good money, but they're all willing to help you out. It's a pretty large hospital and I love the fact that any doctors can log in their system and see what has been going on with other drs or see tests results, makes it so much easier. I wish more hospitals would be like that. I guess you can say the bone scan went well, although I layed on the table without moving for 1h20min!! Yikes, I was in so much pain when it was over. I'm getting the results tomorrow (meaning I'm picking up my CD & report). Next visit with the dr is next Wednesday morning and he better have a surgery date because the pain keeps getting worse. Hubby has to drive my car because it hurts to push on the gas pedal (the car has NO power, you have to push hard!) and I'm avoiding make unnecessary car trips. It stinks! I wore my compression garment on that leg today and it helped some, but geezzz, I just want the thing out. And on the bright side, well I'M STILL ALIVE :) Otherwise, I've been busy busy. Kids went back to school yesterday and I'm in the process of taking care of all the veggies I picked out of the garden on Saturday. Froze some peppers, pureed all the roma tomatoes and simmering into a sauce...Here is a picture of our harvest day! And ALL organic :) ",

Very yummy food, we have a small local restaurant that is Peruvian & Dominican food, so good. When you learn how to make it, you will have to come here and share :) We had a great Thanksgiving, no drama :) Last year my SIL left slamming the door before dinner! And on Black Friday, we have friends from out-of-state that came for the weekend. Heating the turkey in gravy turned out GREAT but... I did miss the smell of the cooking turkey through the day, so next year (Yes, I'm already there!), I will be cooking it on Thanksgiving but earlier in the day so that I don't stress about it being ready on time, then smother in gravy and in the oven to get hot. In a few years, I'll have it down! Texas, good luck on the surgery today. And Carie, get some extra rest to be strong for this next round. And believe it or not, leftovers are ALL gone! Having guests this weekend helped.",

Reason I'm asking is that my parents are wanting to visit for the New Year. They're looking at getting here the day before/of/or after my TC#2 which is Dec. 29th. I'm debating as wether it's a good idea or not! Going through chemo right now, I think I should please myself first instead of others, they're retired so it doesn't matter to them when they visit, but I think they'd like to be here for the New Year itself. But seeing how I'm feeling right now (and I'm only on day 3!) I'm thinking it might be best if they would visit a week after treatment. Plus my mom is a GREAT cook, I wouldn't be able to enjoy the good food and wine ;) Or even the week before, but we celebrate Christmas with hubby's family and I don't think they want to tag along, but it's only 2 days... What do you all think? I don't think that the first week after tx is a good idea?",

After I posted last night, I went upstairs and tried everything we had in the house that was liquid. Nothing did it, I can do milk with added sugar, but not very refreshing and I was sooooo thirsty. Went back to my milkshakes, but changed it a little, this time no bananas and I added pure cocoa, about a tblsp. I told hubby it actually tasted like chocolate cake batter, he tried and said \"yeah, ok!\" LOL, he said I put in WAY too much cocoa, I could barely taste it. Well, as I was putting all the ingredient in my blender, I just lost it, can't believe I finally cry and it has to be over a silly drink! Drank the milkshake and went to bed. Thanks for all the suggestions, I need to make a run to the grocery today. I plan on buying ALL your suggestion plus anything else that I might find! Won't be a cheap run, but I seriously need to find something. It's a bummer because we're really water people, but the kiddos will enjoy drinking everything I don't care for  So far, adding stuff to water hasn't worked, the water taste comes through so strong. Soda typically gives me heartburn, so that wouldn't work either, I can't finish a can before getting horrible heartburn, imagine now.  I'll find something, and I'll try eating soup for lunch everyday. msbusdriver - Sorry about the hair. Hubby's only request was that if I lose my hair while he's at work or sleeping (he works night) to at least cover my head first, then tell, then uncover. He said he might panic if he finds me crying & bald! LOL! but he's fine with it too, just wants warning.",

Do you have a hat or scarf to wear if you do decide to shave? All I can say is that I feel so much better now that it's behind me. You say you're having a party at home, be careful with the food, if you're cook anything so that it doesn't fall in the food! What ever you decide, I'm sure you'll do what's best for you. As far as greens goes, my onc says to not take supplement, but we still have to eat healthy. A supplement will have a high amount of concentrated vitamin C, but a glass of o.j. won't have as much. Haven't tried oj yet, typically gives me heart burns and I don't think it would agree with my taste buds, but you still need the vitamins in food. I went for my LGFB class today, got my goodie bag and a few hats. I ended up being alone so the lady spent a good amount of time teaching me about the make-up, so that was nice. And there's a few ladies that knits hats to donate, I got a few nice hats knitted with that fuzzy yarn, I'm so excited, they're so much fun! They'll be great when I just need to step out to the grocery. And I ordered my wig, she said it might be there tomorrow, but even if it is, I honestly don't know I'd be wearing it for Christmas. The way you're all taking about it being so uncomfortable, even the scarves I think it feel good to just remove them & go bald. My scalp is still sore & achy so the cold air feels good.",

This past Monday, we met with a private school for our son for next year. We were getting ready to leave and hubby looks at me \"you're not going to wear a scarf?\" He was somewhat bothered by it, after all we were going to a \"meeting\" that would decide if they would accept our son or not in the school. Well, my thinking was, it's in a church, we're meeting the pastor, if he can't get past the fact that I have cancer, too bad! I've finally came up with the conclusion that no matter what, someone WILL be uncomfortable. If I wear the scarf, I'm hot, itchy and uncomfortable. If I don't, then other people are uncomfortable seeing bald (at least at first). I'm going through enough right now that I will NOT be the uncomfortable person over it. Good luck, it's an adjustment for everyone. Keep in mind that while you're fine with being bald, you don't see yourself bald all day long like other people do - unless you carry a mirror with you ;)",

Honestly, I don't know that people would have reacted differently if you would have gone bald, they all knew what was going on so I'm not sure it would have made a difference. I went bald to the school meeting, no one said a word or even stared (students included!). The lady in charge called me a few days ago with more info and she only asked how I was doing. I'm really surprised at the response, while I have yet to have one person approach me to talk about cancer, I fear that people wouldn't want to talk with me. My boys started a swimming lessons and when I went last week, I showed up bald, I was expected to be ignored by other moms (fear of talking to a blad woman going through chemo!) but yet 2 other moms started talking to me about other stuff than cancer. That was great!",

Once you've felt akward the first 2-3 times going out bald you forget. Now, last weekend was my hubby grand-father's 80th. It was a HUGE party and I hadn't seen his family since Christmas and had the scarf back then (I was only bald for 2 days!). I was really debating about wearing a scarf or not, his grand-father looked completely shocked when he saw me with the scarf on Christmas. Well, decided against for the exact reason I said, someone WILL be uncomfortable and it won't be me, it will be all 50+ people there ;) Turns out a few people didn't even know what I was going through and a few people told me I was beautiful. It's always nice to hear. I think we make a bigger deal out of it than others do. My MIL actually told me that she prefers seeing bald than to see my port sticking out! As far as little kids, I was worried about freaking them out but really, I think children all handle it better than adult. My 4-year old never even bother to say anything about my lack of hair. Now, how many of you have been hearing a child going \"Mom, that lady doesn't have hair!\" in a store? I really don't mind and feel bad for the embarrassed parent that their child was so loud, but I'm hearing more of these comments than people approaching me about cancer. Just wondering.",

So I opened the door to the poor guy who quickly asked me if I was ok, didn't know what to say other than \"well, yeah, I'm ok\", I am ok! So he asked if I was just sporting a new look? LOL. Told him no, cancer, I'm on chemo, but I am doing ok. He felt bad and I'm hoping to get a new dishwasher out of it since mine doesn't work too good, maybe he'll feel sorry enough to put in a new one ;) LOL. You can't feel bad for people, I know it can be akward, but quite honestly, if I was the stranger, I'd rather feel akward than be the one on chemo! Altough, sometimes when I'm having bad days and go run errands and feel like people are starring, I just want to say \"quit looking, I'm bald, do you want to see?\"! But that would be my french temper... oops, so I just say it in my head and keep walking quietly... You know, my MIL still hasn't seen me bald! She won't do it. I don't mind, even though I see her often, it's never for long visits so I'll do that for her since I love her, but.... comes spring & summer, she'll have to get over it since it will be too hot for me to wear anything. Well, mom & dad are here to the rescue :) Next round on Monday, until then, eating yummy food while I can enjoy it. Raclette on the menu, tomorrow night I believe.

I don't know if it would be because of my age, I always had very thick hair. And they didn't ALL fell and keep growing through chemo. I kept shaving, I think the very thin hair would have made me look more sickly than I looked bald. I know some of you were smooth bald. Bobbi, you look great with your short hair. I always had long hair before, maybe that's why I'm having a harder time with the short short cut. I decided not to get a hair cut until Christmas. I kept debating and finally decided not to cut until it's long. Will get it shaped for pretty Christmas pix ;) Then no cut for another year! Sonia, I didn't do anything to my hair except comb a little. A little wavy in the back but no tight curls or anything. Good luck today. Wishing for a quick recovery :) Bold, I hope your back feels better soon. So, I wasn't thinking much about cancer until my MIL called last night. Her girlfriend who has been so good to me through chemo was diagnosed with Lymphoma yesterday. We don't know all the details yet, she does have a huge tumor on her lungs and still loads of test to go through. Cancer sucks. I don't want to be negative around them, but she looks like she's in bad shape. She has trouble, eating, breathing. I just hate this, I was so upset over it last night.

I used to be so sad because I always had very thick & long eye lashes & brows and after chemo it just wasn't getting as long as before and as thick. Now keep in mind that I didn't loose all during chemo (probably because of before thickness?), well, I looked at myself today and realized that my eye lashes were finally as long as they used to be. I had heard about the 3 month mark when it starts falling again, now I heard an explanation that made a lot of sense. You're hair are on a growing cycle, they fall all the time, but just a few here & there. When you loose all due to chemo, your hair is now ALL on the same cycle, so when it's time for eye lashes to fall, they all fall because they all started growing at the same time. It can take a year for the hair to start alternating so that they don't all fall at once. A couple of months ago, my lashes & brows started going by clumps. As much as it stinks, it's normal. The first time I washed my hair and got a handful in my hand, I was almost panicked until I calmed myself by reminding me that I was loosing hair ALL the time in the shower before chemo. It's normal. You might want to wait a bit before you go ahead with the permanent make-up, that's big step.",

Take it as a blessing, you'll get to spend more time with your family :) Mandy, I'm glad to hear you had a wonderful family vacation. I'm going in for my bone scan on Monday, then meeting the new doc on the 8th. I'll try to get my report somehow in between ;) I just got back from visiting my family in Canada, I was worried about the 9-hour drive (one way that is!) by myself with the lack of cruise control on the car. I made it, that's about what I can say, it was quite painful by the time I got there, but I survived and came back :) While there, we had a family party and my aunt who was diagnosed right before Christmas had just finished her treatment. It's funny how you just bond with people, I had never really talked to her before and all of a sudden we found ourselves talking for a while with this new bond. She's a nice lady. With the great amount of testing I have had since June, I reapplied for the financial assistance from our local hospital and we qualified again  I was scared we wouldn't since hubby got a small raise and a bunch of overtime, even with that, money is tight for unplanned testing, especially if my foot requires surgery, so that was good news when I got home yesterday. I like my hospital :) I guess summer is technically over since the kids are back in school next Monday. It was a fun summer, I was very productive at keeping my kids happy & entertained, otherwise very UNproductive at keeping my house clean & laundry done... hehehe",

The bad news is that they still don't know what it is and I am REALLY FREAKED OUT & SCARED :( I like my new dr, seems to be a bit more knowledgeable than the last guy. He gave me 3 possible options: 1. Osteoid Osteoma - But, my \"spot\" barely lite on the bone scan, and an osteoid osteoma usally gets REALLY bright. Also, it is typically more painful at night which I don't have any problems sleeping, the pain is usually best if my foot is not on the floor. 2. Giant Bone Island - Again, we're dealing with something that should light bright on the bone scan and it's not. At this point, he feels like it's neither. 3. Metastatic Cancer - While cancer rarely occurs below the knee, it IS possible and this is definately an open option at this point. And, I'm quite freaked out because he is the first dr to admit that at this point, it could be cancer. I don't think he strongly believes it, but I just shut down to be able to read his thinking and ask more questions. So the plan is to go into surgery, remove the \"thing\" and do a biopsy. By then, hopefully they'll be able to pin point what it was, hopefully not cancer and I should be relieved of the pain (a few weeks later of course ;) Just waiting for a surgery date now...",

I am considered ER/PR-, but they did find during the biopsy (not lumpectomy) that I was <5% ER+, so because of that little itty bitty risk that there might be some + to it, my OB wouldn't give me anything to regulate my cycle last time I was there. I'll check about the cream though. Dr yesterday gave me a prescription for a yeast infection, she was 50/50 between the infection & plain dryness, but now after putting this subject out there, I'm convinced that I have yet another reason to not be happy with chemo leftovers and I won't get the prescription filled. Geezzz... they don't tell you all that when they're selling you chemo cures cancer! On another note, ladies, I don't know how you all do it! Treatment is over, yet you're all still doing procedure after procedure! I guess it's probably another thing they don't mention that mastectomy with reconstruction  is a LONG process!

Hoping for good news. Made it to my OB this past Friday to get all my results. She will be keeping an eye on the cyst on my ovary, I need to get another ultrasound in 3 months. My hormones levels are low, but since she has nothing to compare with, she can't tell me much about them, but yes, my estrogen is low. She is suggesting an ablation combine with getting my tubes tied, but I'm just not ready to make such a big step, I still have hope that one day I will bear a child and I'm still in my 30s. Like I was expecting, she can't help me with any of my issues :( She also got my testosterone levels check and yes, they are low as well, and that is one hormone I can take, my onc even though it was a good idea (she checked with him first). Of course he does, he's a man ;) Testosterone actually does great things for your body, even helps with vaginal dryness, so I'll be giving it a shot. I am planning on making an appointment with a midwife, I know it sounds odd, but a friend of mine is pregnant with #11! She is well familiar with that lady and she seems to think that she might be able to help me with my issues on a more natural & holistic way than conventional drs would, so I'm looking forward to it.

First, his reasons for suggesting AC+T was that he was trying to put me on a clinical trial involving a new drug called Bev. Took home all tyhe papers last week, didn't even read and decided not to get on the trial. Well, as soon as he found out that I wasn't going on the trial, his recommendation became TC for 6 rounds. Can't blame the guy, they're all trying to put us on trials, but I was sure happy to find out that he wants me on TC now. We even asked about TAC since it's the same with the addition of adriamycin and he said no. We got the path report back from Mayo too, and they're saying no nodes involved also, so that helped his decision stating that A isn't necessary in my situation. Since 2 people are saying negative nodes & Hopkins says 1 micro met 2mm, no full ax. disscetion or radiation. Got my report from the oncotype and they're telling me that I'm ER- and onc is one of the rare onc that doesn't believe that Tamoxifen really helps. So biopsy says ER+ (weak) and oncotype dx says ER-, he's not recommending Tamox, offering but not recommending and agrees with the fact I don't want to take it.

My taste is definately off, peanut butter just didn't taste right this morning, soup was ok, then I swang by Walmart to run a few errands, forgot my bottle of water. My mouth is really dry, so I started craving watermelon, of course, not in season! so I settled for an apple that juste didn't taste right, tried grapes, they were horrible. I hope this taste issue doesn't stick for 18 weeks, because we love to eat in this house! By the time I left the store, I because very sluggish and out of it, it was time for me to go home. I guess I'm thankfull that I'm not dealing with nausea. Karen - Sorry to hear you're going down this road again, but you'll find the ladies here very nice & helpfull. TC isn't as harsh as AC, I think most ladies here aren't having much nausea with TC. Today is day 2 for me and still no nausea, took my pill as they told me, but I really had none. sdavis - sorry you're switching to 6 rounds, but TC isn't as hard on your body as the other ones. I have to bring more food next time, hubby stuck around so I sent him for lunch, but I'll be going alone from now on, so I have to be prepared for lunch.",

I'd like to have a few sitting around here just in case. I didn't realize that week 2 was going to be the weakest week, I had assume I was getting out of it. Looks like my son is getting a head cold, so I'll be staying away from him. I feel bad as he's been having a hard time since my cancer trip started and now I'll have to push him away :( But I did tell him this morning that mommy can't get sick, so hard to understand in a 5 year old's head. Colleen - That's a tricky one. My first thought was to say that chicken is really starting to taste bad, but if you do, NO more chicken, they'll all switch to ground beef, the other cheap meat, so be prepared for tons of spaghetti & chili! But.. I hear you, we were fed from Mon-Thursday this week and we had chicken & rice EVERY night this week, not true, once it was chicken & potatoes ;) Yeah, I'm pretty sick of chicken as well and I love chicken! Starting next week, they'll be bringing food Mon-Wed-Fri until treatment is over (probably around May). I am thankfull and don't want to complain, so we'll try to do variety on nights we have to cook. Our problem is that everyone wants to bring hot food. It's Winter, by the time it gets here, it needs to be warmed anyway, so chicken tends to be dry, which I have a hard time with since tasteless dry meat, all I have is texture, not very appealing. I've been trying to say that food doesn't have to be here AT dinner time, I can heat up, but it's not working. Oh well, still very thankfull I'm not having to cook. Didn't think I would, maybe it's the lack of taste, but I do miss my cooking. No problem with cheese here, we all LOVE cheese, but can't stand american cheese, again texture. Firni - Bone aches are from the Neulasta shot. I'm working as hard as I can not to be sick and to keep my blood counts high enough. I DON'T want that shot! Got aches bones from Taxotere, the nurse said it would have been worse if I had the shot. But it should pass. Have you tried a hot bath? Brenny - on the wine issue. Not sure why, but you shouldn't be drinking every day. My nurse said, it's ok if you want a glass on Christmas but should be too much! Yeah right, I'll be having more than 1 glass per cycle (if my taste buds wants to show up again!). Like hubby said, if she said 1 glass, she means 2 because she knows that patients always push limits a little therefore they can't give you the exact limit. I'd have to ask why we can't drink. But if you have1 glass/week I'm sure you're fine. I need to work on a question list for next appt! sdavis - You're too funny! My first thought was, WOW, I can't believe she actually wants to have sex!! LOL! Then I figured it out. You know hubby got a book about husband dealing with breast cancer (how to cope withy wife BC). Of course he's a man, so he turned to the sex part, books says \"be prepared to take care of your own self for a few months!\" He's been nice though, hasn't even tried, but I'm starting to feel bad for him, but this is NOT even near being in my thoughts yet. I keep telling him I'm starting to look like Frankenstein's wife with all those cuts! But yeah, I was told to use condom as well. While chemo causes infertility, in some cases and can cause fertility. We have already been dealing with infertility since they day we were married, with our luck, that when I'd finally get pregnant! Well, gotta go. Have to fix my hair while they're still here ;)",

Thanks :) About LE, I'm aware that I'm at risk but my understanding is the risks are lowered by having SNB vs the full axilliary node dissection. And if they had tested positive, they probably would have removed more. Thank you for the suggestion of meeting with a specialist, while I did see a very nice lady about my foot, I'm not sure that she deals a lot with cancer people so I'll try to find a new one from the cancer center here. I already own a compression pump for my foot so if worse comes to worse, all I need is an extra garment. Still trying figure out what's wrong with the left side of my body ;) I'll have to check the LE board when I have a chance, still so much to explore! Caroline",

I know I'm going to be ok but I am just sooooo scared right now. I'm trying to keep it together for the kids, they're only 4 & 5 and are upset enough as it is that I don't need to be crying & flipping out right now. Hubby just left with the kids, didn't want to tag along. Feeling anti-social, plus I'm becoming a germ freak, I was scared that someone there might be sick and since I feel something coming.. Well, I just didn't feel like talking to anyone. On the bright side, my port is finally feeling better and I'm able to sleep at night. Firni - Hope all goes well with your surgery tomorrow :) Mary - All my onc said is use your common sense, stay away from sick people, don't hug/kiss them at parties (so easy to do right now!), wash your hands a lot. You can also wear those hospital masks if you're in a public place that you feel if full of sick people, avoid buffets (even eating out, you don't know if the cook or waiter has a cold). Now the tricky one is all the Christmas parties, you really might want to consider eating before going to a party. Food sits out for a long time and gets as germy as buffets do with everyone touching the serving spoons. If you eat before, you'll still eat some at the party, but not as much. I'm seriously considering that one. We might have to look like rude people for a few months, but if we get real sick it can be very bad for us. Everyone as already been warned that I cannot be around sick people and that if someone has a cold to please let me know. Whenever we have to go out, I'll be handing a vitamin C to my kids & hubby before leaving the house and upon return. Since I can't do V-C, I'll at least boost their immune system a bit.",

Hubby said I was so pale he wanted to take me by the hand & say \"let's get out of here!\", but we stayed and treatment started. A few minutes into the Taxotere, I started getting this horrible taste in my mouth, the nurse proceded to say that this usually happens with taxotere & younger patient! Then onto the Cytoxan. All of a sudden, I started feeling like I had to sneeze and started blowing my nose, to which the nurse proceded to say that this usually happens with cytoxan & younger patient! Again!! When we left the chemo room, we went down to the wig bank and got my first wig! I still don't know how I feel about it, I really think I'll be more of a hats & scarves person. They also gave me a night cap for when the hair start falling and to keep my head warm. I guess I survived my first tx, altough I'm still very freaked out & mad that I have this chemo inside my body right now, and a little depressed over it. Thankfully, I don't have to cook dinner tonight, the ladies from our church are providing us with meals until Thursday, then hubby will be home for the weekend. They're talking about providing meals for the next 6 or so months, until chemo & radiations are done. While I'd probably be able to cook dinner, we'll sure be eating healthier since if I had to cook tonight our dinner would probably be a yummy box of Kraft Dinner! LOL!

Next week, I'll go back to normal life, this week, I'm enjoying. Amazingly I feel great, not thinking about reccurrence or anything. It's kind of scary, I'm feeling like I just woke from a bad dream, put it behind & moved on like it NEVER happened. How can I feel that way so quickly? Plus I don't want to forget, I need to remember what I've just gone through so that I can make the right choice to prevent going back down that road and to keep remembering that life is a precious thing and I need to take care of myself. Both of my children will be in school next year :) I homeschooled this year, I know what was I thinking!!! Looking forward to having them in school next year.

It's a pre-foreclusure so we're getting a GREAT deal, well below market price. Well, the bank officially accepted our offer today, we're closing in a month, then I have 2 weeks to get in there, clean it & paint it while the kids are in school then we move and they'll have a back yard again.

I only homeschooled one year, couldn't handle it! LOL! Homeschooling pretty much kept my mind off cancer during chemo & rads, my son is strong willed and stubborn, so I am, add chemo in the mix, we didn't stand a chance at a succesful homeschool experience, when April came around, I told hubby that he was smart enough, I was done and he was going to school the following year! It was only kindergarten though. We found a great little Christian school in our area with a pace curriculum, he started in first grade and around march, moved to 2nd grade as he was done the material for the year. My hat's off to any homeschoolers out there, I couldn't do it, and in our family, for everyone sanity, my kids are much better at school! With them at school, I started substituting last fall, I'll be going back next fall and I'll be teaching the art class for the elementary kids at my boy's school and a cooking class for the middle/high school. I can't wait, it should be a lot of fun. Small school, they were only 13 from K-12 last year! Oh no Bold, those scare are horrible. I had one last fall, thought for sure it was it and found out my coccyx was crooked and I had herniated disk in my back. Wishing you for the same out come. Any big plans for the 4th anyone? Hubby & I got back from Prince Edward Island last week, we went away childless for a week for our 10th anniversary, it was wonderful and reminded me how much fun I have with my husband. He's a great guy :) Next week, we're taking the kids camping in Ocean City, should be fun and weather is supposed to be mid-80's, can't beat that for beach weather. I hope you all have a fun weekend.",

I think I've had more scans full of radiation done since cancer (a year!) then I ever did in my life before :( They keep covering you all over to protect your body because, let's face it, those scans aren't good for you. I feel like every few months I have a battery of tests done. I never use to go to the dr before cancer, and now that highly irritates me and I feel like my body will never be the same again. Then I read studies and all about how bad radiation therapy is for you and that the bad outweighs the barely existent benifits, and about chemo and it makse me sick that I've put my body through all that. When you're first diagnosed with cancer, you want it out and done and fast, I wish I wouldn't have been so scared and had taken the time to really read about it all. I probably still would have done chemo, but I'm about 95% sure I would have opted out of radiation and I'm so thankful I put my foot down and refused Tamoxifen. What is done is done, but when I think about it, it makes me sick and furiates me that I didn't take more time. At least I didn't let them talk me into Adriamycin! Phew!! LOL! I guess it's just one of those days :( I'm back to mostly being my normal self, my hair have grown beyond belief and since I waited a whole year before a cut, it is looking like a normal cut I could have had in the past. When I look in the mirror, I no longer see cancer, then every few months, comes a round of tests because my body is now acting up :(:(:( Sorry about ranting, I should have a nice glass of wine, but we're out :( LOL! On the bright side, my CT scan CDs should be ready for me in the morning along with the report for me to read and not understand! Then again, a few click online to panic me trying to understand... hehehe",

And the port scar, well, it's just big, rough and ugly, but even when the port was in, I decided I wasn't going to try to hide it or I would have had to get a complete new wardrobe! It's quite high, so yeah, I went out through chemo with a huge bump sticking out of my chest!! At least now, it's flat, but I try to not let it bother me. I really try hard to not think cancer anymore. I hope your hair start growing soon so that you can feel the same way :) You are taking hormones right now, aren't you? Is it suppose to affect hair growth? Carie - That is WONDERFUL that the pain is going away!!! So my foot... I got my films & report yesterday. It states that it could possibly be a bone island? I've read about them, benign condition, but... in a symptomatic patients and patient with a history of cancer, they often do a biopsy on them to be sure as they can mimic a cancer tumor and by misdiagnosed. Also, bone island don't show on bone scan? Not sure why, but they don't, so if I was to have a bone scan and they can't see it, than it would mean good news. Still painful though, so I might need surgery either ways. I have a follow-up next week, but I'm trying to talk them into sending me for the bone scan first, instead of going, forking out $25 to be told that I need a bone scan before making a decision on what to do! I'm hanging in the thoughts that cancer rarely appears below the knee. But it hurts, yesterday was a bad day, pain and swelled up by night time, and now is still quite painful :( More waiting, probably more testing...",

I was quite emotional working on it as I re-read it all, I had to make a few corrections, chemo wasn't to do to prevent me from making mistakes! So, yeah, it brought me to tears a few time. I had been wanting to do this book since I've been out of treatment. I don't think I could have stomach working on it that soon after. I wouldn't want to have it published, I don't mind sharing my life with people I know, but wouldn't want my personal life out there for strangers. Plus many pictures of friends & family that might not want to be put out there. Mandy, see, I view Christmas time differently. I can totally understand where you're coming from, but last Christmas I was just so happy and thrilled to be healthy, have hair (losing my hair 4 days before Christmas wasn't ideal! LOL), taste all the wonderful food, traditions, not be scared to get sick from hugging everyone and really just be alive. I really see Christmas time as a big celebration right now. Of course hubby totalled (not his fault at all) our car 2 weeks before Christmas last year, that put a demper on our happiness a bit, but still. Maybe if you shared your anxiety with your family it would help relieve some of it? By trying to protect your family and keeping it all to yourself, you're probably putting more stress on your shoulder than you need. And they might share the same emotions and trying to protect you as well. I say talk to them or maybe you could have a nice family celebration dinner, without feeling like you're whining, tell them all you're sharing this dinner to celebrate the fact that you're cured and that you're not in the same position as you were 2 years ago. Maybe that you could cheer you up to see it with different eyes. Texas, sorry to hear about you being down. While I could understand all of you, I know feel like I don't. I didn't need extra surgeries and I'm not taking any hormones, maybe it's easier for me to get past BC? I never really looked at myself in the mirror before, so I still don't, and hubby, well, he's a man, and he sees boobs, he doesn't care what they look like! LOL! But I can appreciate some, after my lumpectomy, I was so scared to remove my bandages, it looked horrible, one breast bigger than the other and they weren't leveled at all. I really didn't want hubby to look at me. Have you tried being completely blunt with him and just take his hand and put it on it? It could just be one of those situation where you feel weird about doing something but when you try, you realize that it wasn't a big deal and you'll do it again. So next time there's some action going on, just direct his hand, he won't even notice it's the \"bad\" breast. Heck, it's worth a try! Well, ladies, sending you all big hugs.",

First, his reasons for suggesting AC+T was that he was trying to put me on a clinical trial involving a new drug called Bev. Took home all tyhe papers last week, didn't even read and decided not to get on the trial. Well, as soon as he found out that I wasn't going on the trial, his recommendation became TC for 6 rounds. Can't blame the guy, they're all trying to put us on trials, but I was sure happy to find out that he wants me on TC now. We even asked about TAC since it's the same with the addition of adriamycin and he said no. We got the path report back from Mayo too, and they're saying no nodes involved also, so that helped his decision stating that A isn't necessary in my situation. Since 2 people are saying negative nodes & Hopkins says 1 micro met 2mm, no full ax. disscetion or radiation. Got my report from the oncotype and they're telling me that I'm ER- and onc is one of the rare onc that doesn't believe that Tamoxifen really helps. So biopsy says ER+ (weak) and oncotype dx says ER-, he's not recommending Tamox, offering but not recommending and agrees with the fact I don't want to take it. Port on Wed. chemo teaching on Thursday than start chemo on Monday, Dec 8. 2 months from dx to start chemo, I guess it's not bad. I'm happy :)",

I was thinking about something, while you don't have health coverage right now, nothing prevents you to make an appointment with a reputable breast surgeon, tell the receptionist that you will have coverage at the time of appointment. Depending where you live and where you go and who you see, you could very well have a 1-2 month wait for an appt. I was lucky and went in about 2 weeks after mammo since my BS had a cancellation, otherwise, it would have been about 2 months wait to get an appt. Something else to think about.",

Obviously, we need women that are willing to get in those trials, but I was only 33 at time of dx and I was willing to suffer from unknown side effects for the rest of my life when I knew that traditonal tx would work just fine in my situation. With that said, adriamycin is a nasty drug and I wasn't even willing to take that one due to the heart problems that it might cause. Adrimycin is not the ONLY chemo option out there. You need to find out your ER/PR/HER-2 status, that would help you make a more informed decision. Some drugs don't work on ER+, triple negative... It's not all that easy to make the best informed decision. Good luck to you.",

They have financial assistance and if you make less than 84K / year and insurance decides not to pay, they will cover for the entire cost of the test. Anyhow, patiently waiting.. some more ;)",

Of course, they don't advertise it, but it's worth calling. Chances are, you can wait 2 months to get it check, of course you don't because you're scared, but most people with cancer have had it for at least 5 years so 2 months doesn't usually change much to the outcome, especially if you had a clean lumpectomy 2 years ago. I would be scared that if you go to your PCP, it would become existing condition and then, you might have to wait a year for them to pay? Just some thoughts. Hope this turns out to be nothing.",
