She did an exam and said that despite negative mammogram and ultrasound she is still very concerned. I have new dimpling that has formed in the past month, and my breast continues to increase in size. The lump hasn't changed at all. She said 10% of lesions can't be seen on mammogram and US. She is sending an urgent referral to breast clinic for MRI. I asked her if I should be concerned AGAIN and she said she was was concerned. So more waiting",

My indentations are still there and I noticed a few new dimples yesterday. The only thing that is giving me hope is that the lump is kinda movable. I mean, I can slide the skin over it, but it stays in the same spot from underneath, if that makes any sense at all. Does anyone know if I will actually find out anything tomorrow",
