Could also be referred pain from the neck. I\u2019ve been experiencing pretty intense, sometimes severe headaches as a result of neuropathic pain for over a year now - headaches started with Neulasta and worsened with Taxol and then again after radiation. Tamoxifen didn\u2019t help matters also. Gabapentin helped for a bit but when I tried to go off the medication I realized that the sensations and pain were much worse than before. I\u2019m not certain if the med made it worse in the long run, but am now having to get back on it and a few other meds for some relief. My advice is to see a neurologist or physiatrist as soon as you can to develop a treatment plan. Good luck and keep us posted.",

I am 6 months out from active treatment and having an awful time as my headaches are now constant and are now accompanied by face and neck pain. I never had headaches until I was diagnosed. I also had them at various times throughout treatment as Neulasta and Taxol were not kind to me. Was also on Lupron for a few months before starting Tamoxifen in December. Imaging for the head is all clear but I have some arthritic changes in spine which could be contributing. Trying various prescriptions and due to start PT soon. The constant pressure in my head is taking a toll as my QOL is now less than when I was going through treatment.  DJohn",

      "Content": "Djohn wrote: I started chemo in January and completed 4 rounds of dose dense AC every 2 weeks to be followed by 4 rounds of dose dense Taxol. After the 2nd round of dose dense Taxol I started to experience neuropathy in my hands and feet which I knew could happen as one of the side effects. However a few days after my second dose of Taxol, I started to experience a burning/stinging sensation on my torso - back, shoulders, arms, underarms - whenever I used lotions or underarm deodorant. I experience the same sensation on my skin if I just rub it also with no product. Has anyone else experienced this form of skin sensitivity from Taxol treatment? Log in to post a reply",
