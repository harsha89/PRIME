Pending further immunohistochemical confirmation.\"  Goes on to say: \"paraffin block will be forwarded to genzyme for immunohistochemical evaluation in order to rule out any subtle underlying malignancy and a final report will follow.\" Surgeon said no follow up appointment, no call to check final report. nothing she said this is final in her opinion.
