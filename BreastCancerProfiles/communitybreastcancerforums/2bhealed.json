      "Content": "2bhealed wrote: I recently noticed fluid that would come from my nipples when I would gently squeeze them. I had been having breast pain/tenderness but my doc thinks it is the chest wall that is sore/inflamed and told me to take Naprosyn or Advil. One of my nipples looks a little inverted but no redness or orange type of characteristics. Every now and then they do itch...is IBC the only cancer that would have these syptoms? I had an ultrasound on Wednesday and should have results within 5 days they said. I am concerned because I have a history of lung problems and over the past year have had pneumonia 4 times and have had a lot of radiation focused on my chest/lung area. Do technicians usually send readings from ultrasounds that show findings of possible cancer/tumors to the docs immediatly, or is the 5 days waiting time normal no matter what?
