I guess it's better to know now, rather than later, though it probably feels pretty bad.  Not everyone is equipped to handle this kind of bad news.  I have 3 sisters and a brother. When I told them I had BC, 2 of the sisters completely ignored it and my brother made multiple drunken calls to me begging my not to die on him.  I finally had to stop taking his calls--I simply didn't have the energy to prop him up while undergoing multiple surgeries, chemo, sepsis, and infections. My mother was almost as bad--she kept telling me stories of people she knew who had had BC and every story ended with , \"and SHE DIED!\"  My adult kids were pretty useless. Thankfully, DH was up to the challenge, because the rest of the family just bailed on me. Now is the time to identify your tribe. You may be surprised at who gets in your corner. For me, it was my Sunday School class. We had only been members a short while and I really didn't know too many of them. But they took us on and were really there for us both (DH developed prostate cancer right after I finished chemo.) They made calls, sent cards, and brought meals twice a week for several weeks until I could get back on my feet. I would have never in a million years dreamed that this bunch of almost-strangers would gather round us like this, but they did. So, as much as I love my siblings and mother, I figured out pretty early that they weren't going to be my support system. ",

And pregnancy hormones are likely amplifying the whole situation, too. Without seeing your report, it's hard to know what to tell you. But there is this scoring system called BIRADs that might explain things. BIRADS stands for Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. It helps radiologists put the findings from mammogram screening into a small number of well-defined categories. Here is a quick & dirty breakdown: Hopefully, this will turn out to be a whole lotta nothing. Take comfort from the fact that breast cancer is extremely uncommon in women under 35.

But my head hair is thick and curly, a big difference from my thin straight hair previously. The only issue that I have had is some peripheral neuropathy, probably caused by the Taxotere. I saw a neurologist who says he believes it will eventually improve, but he can't guarantee that it will go away. It's not awful and if it doesn't worsen, I can live with it. I think every chemo has its own issues. Talk with your doctor about your concerns and see if he/she feels strongly about TC or if he things another drug cocktail would be just as good.",

I was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2015.  In the last 12 months I have had 2 lumpectomies, a bout of sepsis, 4 rounds of chemo, diagnosed with 2 gene mutations, and had a BMX.  I held up very well through the whole thing, until I suffered severe tissue necrosis and lost half of what was left of my right chest and a huge 6cm seroma of the left side. It was so horrible I could hardly even look at it, and I've been a nurse for 39 years!  I went into a deep funk---I could hardly bathe & dress, or even get off the couch. I was totally uninterested in reading, watching TV, going to a movie, going to church, or even going out for ice cream. My DH was frantic with worry. Thankfully, he got me to a doctor and she diagnosed me with PTSD immediately. She put me on an antidepressant (Lexapro) which also has some anti-anxiety properties. She also gave me something to help me sleep, because I had hardly slept from the day of surgery. Within 2 weeks I felt like myself again, even though the wound healing still struggled along for a total of 16 weeks.  I'm 7 months post-BMX now. I'm off the sleeping med and weaning off the Lexapro. Both meds helped tremendously. I never went in for talk therapy for this because I had a pretty good handle on my feelings.  Your mileage may vary.  I find that it helps me to not think too far into the future.  Three-four months is about my limit.  If I find myself perseverating on things farther out that, I just have to shut it down.  I get busy with housework, or doing something for someone else. Anything but allowing those intrusive thoughts to take over and bog me down. I strongly recommend that anyone who has feelings of anxiety, hopelessness, lack of interest, or unreasonable sadness for 2 weeks or more should talk to their doctor. You may have depression, anxiety, or PTSD (or all three), all of which are treatable conditions.  You don't have to suffer through it.",

Initially, I thought I would be out of the woods when the BRCA genes came back clear. It took an additional 2-3 weeks to get the results on the 32-gene assay that was done and unfortunately, I came back positive for both Chek2 and PALB2 (associated with BRCA2). The genetics counselor gave me a lifetime breast cancer risk breast risk of 45% Yikes! At first, my breast surgeon recommended close surveillance and I was good with that. Then I consulted with an oncologist and when she saw my family history, gene mutations, plus the known BC that I currently have, she immediately recommended chemo and bilateral mastectomy, and possibly ovary removal. Had I known all this earlier, I don't know whether I would have had a PBMX. Of course, these genes have only been studied in the last 2 years and there isn't a clear consensus on what should be done. Now that I *do* know, I will pay for my adult kids to be tested. They have a 50% chance of having one or both gene mutations, as do my own siblings. So I'm working up a medical family tree that everyone can take to the doctor, along with copies of my genetic testing. The 32-gene assay is pretty expensive ($3000+) but it's only about $300 to test for PALB2 and Chek2. Totally worth it. It will be my Christmas present to my kids.",

Colonoscopies aren't so bad--the prep isn't pleasant, but the procedure itself is a breeze so if you haven't had one in the last 5 years, contact your PCP and get a referral.  Colorectal cancer is highly treatable because it is very slow-growing.

      "Content": "May 15, 2016 08:21AM - edited May 15, 2016 08:23AM by mustlovepoodles Florida, I do understand your concern. I found out that I have both the Chek2 and PALB2 gene mutations only after I got breast cancer. My two older children decided to be tested, as well, and while my 30yo son is negative for both, my 23yo daughter is positive for both. Needless to say, I am devastated, as is she. We have so much cancer in our families. Sometimes she says she feels doomed. I always try to validate her feelings, but I also point out to her that she is fortunate to live in a time when they even know about this stuff. Despite finding 19 cases of cancer in my 1st & 2nd degree relatives, nobody ever though to have me get genetic testing. So I had no idea that I was living with a ticking time bomb. I took my DD to see my breast surgeon just yesterday. She was thorough and held nothing back. I was very impressed at how well she explained everything to DD in a way that she could understand. They did a baseline ultrasound in the office and will do a baseline MRI next week. DD will have surveillance every 6 months, minimum, forever. And unlike those of us who are older and didn't know anything about these genetic mutations, she will have the opportunity to have risk-reducing surgeries at some point in her late 30s-40s, if she so desires. I will say that although DD is very upset, she does not feel like her life isn't worth living. She doesn't hold me responsible, even though my genes clearly ARE responsible (and I had to get them from one or both of my parents). She is not sorry I had her. DD is very pragmatic and she has just taken this news like a man--or really like a very strong WOMAN. Take courage. You and my DD have long lives ahead of you and you are both very fortunate to live in a country and a time when scientists are actively studying breast cancer and gene mutations. Don't feel the need to make any permanent decisions right now.",

I don't give him much opportunity to see it. I had no choice but go flat for a long while, due to extreme sensitivity that made it impossible to tolerate anything against my skin.  About 6 months post-BMX I received a set of Knitted Knockers. As soon as I put them in my shirt, I had a surge of self-confidence.  Two weeks later I got my first set of silicone breast forms. I wear them every. single. day. No matter how hot it is outside. They look totally natural and sometimes I forget I'm wearing breast forms.  That is, until it's time to dress for bed or get a shower. Ugh. Don't look!  I don't have any stinging or itching, but I do get weird sensations when my chest gets cold---it feels just like when your nipples stand up, LOL. Sometimes it feels like my milk lets down. But my whole chest is numb! I just know one thing: I cannot live like this. I have decided to pursue DIEP reconstruction in NOLA.  I actually was scheduled twice already, once in Feb and again in April. Unfortunately, my mom was ill and she took a turn for the worse about 2 weeks before each appt. After I canceled the second time I decided to just wait it out; Mother was on hospice and it really wasn't the right time to sign up for that kind of surgery. She passed away in June and we ate up the summer and fall getting my house and her house ready for sale. My house closes next week, so it's time for me to contact the Center and get on their calendar again. ",

She looked over my records, my family medical tree, AND my gene mutations and decided the best course of action was NOT radiation, but chemo, BMX, and preventative hysterectomy. Totally changed my treatment plan, but I was okay with it because by that time I had thoroughly researched my path report and knew that chemo was going to be necessary, at the least. I can't say enough good things about Dr. Volas-Redd, her staff, and her colleagues. She and they have been nothing but supportive and wonderful. She is very encouraging and upbeat, but also shoots from the hip--no holding back. Personally, I love that in a doctor.

Your doctor will probably do an MRI of the breasts to look for anything there they may not have seen yet and a bone scan to see if there's anything worrisome outside the breasts. If those tests are clear, then it's likely you are considered early stage, which has a very good survival rate, >90%.  So, all is not lost.  If you're having too hard a time with your anxiety, consider talking to your doctor about taking something for it. We've all been in your shoes and many of us have needed a little something to help us over the hump.  As my oncologist told me at my first visit: \"This next year is gonna SUCK.

Anti-anxiety meds make most people more relaxed, even drowsy, but a few will experience the opposite effect--agitation, increased anxiety. You'd want to know how your body reacts BEFORE your test. Also, plan to take your pill AFTER you sign your consents. They may have to cancel your test if they perceive that your consent was given while you were under the influence. I took a Xanax immediately after i signed. It works pretty quickly. By the time i got undressed, got a gown on, got into the room, and got positioned exactly right the Xanax had kicked in. They numbed my breast very well, so the only real pain i felt was the initial shot (very small needle, btw.) There is a lot of clicking and some pressure that goes along with the test, but if you have pain speak up right away so they can give you more lidocaine.",

My tumor was 1.9cm, so just under stage 2, and grade 3. It was also PR-, which is considered to be more aggressive. So, I had 4 rounds of chemo without too much difficulty. I take Femara daily, with no side effects. Honestly, my breast cancer experience was intense for the first year (2015-2016), but after that it's been pretty anticlimactic. Do I think about having breast cancer sometimes? Yes. Sometimes. I don't dwell on it every day. I'm not one to perseverate on the what ifs in life. I figure my risk is either 0% or 100%. If cancer recurs, it's 100%. But if it doesn't, my risk is 0%. At least, that's how I think of it. I refuse to mourn something that hasn't happened yet and MAY NEVER happen. That's just a waste of precious life and I ain't got time for that! ",

Of course, the decision was pretty well forced on me--I already had breast cancer when we found out that I have PALB2 and Chek2 mutations, both of which cause breast cancer and other cancers. My 23yo daughter has also been diagnosed with both mutations and her estimated lifetime risk of breast cancer stands at 58%+. We are both understandably devastated, but I take comfort in the knowledge that she will have better surveillance and better opportunities for prevention than I had. Does it make it any better? not really. At the moment, she feels doomed. But I think in time she will come to appreciate the so-called \"gift\" of knowledge. If, by having a double mastectomy, taking anti-hormonals, having her ovaries removed, all at a later date, IF it means that she has a longer and cancer-free life, then it will all be worth it, IMO. I wish you the best as you wrestle with these decisions. I know it isn't easy.",

Your surgeon will help you determine your what type of surgery would be best for you. The oncologist determines the course of treatment, whether you would benefit from chemo and/or radiation. Most of us do not need chemo, btw. Since your tumor is estrogen responsive, they'll probably put you on a hormone suppressor, too. As for your co-workers, they are being nosy busybodies. Your medical treatment is none of their business and you don't owe them one explanation. Tell them you don't want to talk about it. If your distress is overwhelming, let your doctor know.

DCIS is usually treated with lumpectomy plus radiation, or sometimes mastectomy, if the tumor is very large (several cms.) Pure DCIS is never treated with chemo. Your tumor is hormone responsive and you are pre-menopausal, so you will probably be advised to take Tamoxifen for 5-10 years. Take some deep breaths now. Hearing the words \"breast cancer\" sends most of us reeling. I've been a nurse for 40 years and I can attest that having a little knowledge doesn't make it any easier. But BC is generally a slow-moving disease. You don't need to be in a rush to make decisions or have surgery. As my oncologist said to me, \"This is early stage. You're not gonna die.

I found out about my breast cancer while on a family vacation in Jul 2015. I only told two people--my DH and my sister, who had also had BC-- until I had completed more testing and had a plan in hand. Once the plan was in place (all that took about 3 weeks), only THEN did I tell my kids. And the way I did it, well...it turned out funny. I decided to call a family meeting on a Sunday afternoon. When everyone was there I asked my 30yo DS to bring us a plate of fresh cookies I had baked. He walked into the family room with the cookies like he was holding a dead cat, and said, \"I sort of feel like somebody has cancer or something.\" Well, that certainly broke the ice! So I owned up that I did, indeed, have breast cancer, that I would be having some surgery, and I wasn't going to die. So, then we ate cookies and watched \"Muppet Treasure Island\"--nothing like a bit of Tim Curry to get your mind off things. Of course, as it turned out nothing went as planned-I needed extra surgeries, chemo, more surgeries, had complications--but my DH and my kids really rose to the occasion. They cooked for me and drove me to appointments. They did the grocery shopping and the yard work. They hung out with me and watched stuff on Netflix when I wasn't allowed to go out in public (on chemo.) And none of them ever batted an eyelash when they saw me with my wig or beanies (I never could let them see my bald head, not even my DH.) Interestingly, about 9 months after my BC diagnosis my DH was diagnosed with advance stage prostate cancer. Knowing that the family meeting/cookie bit was not going to go over again, this time we invited them to our local pizza dive. This time it was my 23yo DD who said, \"I feel like there's something y'all want to say.\" My kids are nothing, if not intuitive. So we got a round of beers and a pizza, and told them the plan, simply and plainly as we had before. They took a few minutes to absorb it (and the beer), and then life went on pretty much as before. They kept the dog for us when DH was in the hospital. They again cooked and shopped for us. Thankfully, DHs cancer was contained so he didn't need rads or chemo. But if he had, I'm sure my kids would have stepped up in any way we needed. Just sit tight for now and be ready for anything.",

I have made up a medical family tree and sent it out to all my sibs, aunts, uncles, and cousins so they can discuss it with their own doctors. If they need copies of my records I will make that available to them. I have three adult kids. My two oldest are anxious to have genetic testing, especially my 22yo daughter. I just pray she's negative. My youngest is very mentally handicapped and cannot participate in his own care. We will not pursue genetic testing for him, as it would not change the way we care for him.",

Then the PS comes behind her and gathers up the skin and fat that are left and forms it into two mounds. The size of the mounds is directly proportional to the original size of the breasts--big breasts leave a lot more skin and fat than small breasts.

I had a ton of necrosis on the right, with deep tunneling--it looked like a wolf had snatched a chunk of my chest off. I also had an enormous seroma on the left that once opened poured gunk down my side, despite the two drains. My DH couldn't even look at it, beyond the first glance. I was mutilated. My PS started me off on wet-to-dry dressings on the right, but it soon became clear that the wound was far too involved for that. She put on a wound vac that had to be changed every 2-3 days in her office for 7 weeks, after which she changed to some other kind of special dressing that I changed every 3 days at home. All the while, this huge seroma on the left had to be packed and unpacked with string-gauze twice a day. Total healing time was 16 weeks for each side. My two consolations were that the wounds never got infected and I didn't have immediate reconstruction. No doubt, I would have lost it all. Still, the scarring is substantial and the skin is adhered to the chest wall. My new PS says he can revise all of it when he does my DIEP (yes, I fired my other PS. Totally lost confidence in her.) This has by far been the worst experience of my life. I wish you all the best.",

You just had MAJOR surgery 13 days ago, for cryin' out loud!  Of course you're having a hard time--who wouldn't?  I imagine that most, if not all, of us who have gone through what you're going through have had some degree of depression and anxiety. I know I did. Like you, my tumor was a small stage 1, luminal B.  I endured a LX, re-excision, and 4 rounds of chemo before I had my BMX.  I was holding out pretty well until then, even when I lost my hair and everything tasted like paint and grass clippings. I had intended to be back at work in about 2 weeks, because, you know, several ladies here at BCO had breezed through theirs.  Well, the BMX did me in.  I had a 4\" wide seroma on the left and massive tissue necrosis on the right which resulted in a huge hole 3-1/2\" wide and 2-1/2\" deep, down to the chest wall. I had to pack both twice a day. That lasted about 3 days and then I broke down.  It was just so horrible. It took 16 WEEKS for my wounds to heal. I think I was about 2 weeks post-op when I hit the wall--I couldn't concentrate, couldn't get off the couch, didn't want to bathe or dress, didn't want to talk to anyone. Basically, I just wanted to sit in front of the TV and eat chips for 18 hours a day.  I went to my doctor and poured my heart out. She immediately diagnosed me with PTSD.  She understood my feelings of mutilation and discouragement.  For me, the answer was a course of antidepressant, Lexapro, which treats depression and anxiety and is not habituating. Within 2 weeks of starting it, I was like my old self. I went back to work at 4 weeks post-op. I had burnt up all my sick leave and vacation, so I really didn't have a choice. It was hard, but since my depression was lifting, I was able to manage.  I guess my best piece of advice for you is this: don't compare yourself to someone else.  You can only heal so fast.  And make no mistake, your body is in fight mode during this time of intensive healing. Rather than focusing on what you should be doing, concentrate your energies on what you CAN do right now.  Baby steps. You'll get there; we all do. This won't be forever.  Perhaps it's time to talk to your doctor about your depression.",

She really felt that I would be playing with fire if I didn't have chemo. So I had 4 rounds of TC. Honestly, it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Nothing like you see on TV, with the constant vomiting and gray face. I had a lot of fatigue, my hair fell out, my taste buds changed temporarily, but I never threw up. I did have to go to the ER a couple times for fever. In all, I think I missed about 5 days of work. Now, the BMX has been a whole other story. I lost a lot of tissue on the right to deep necrosis--the wound was absolutely ghastly. I've been a nurse for 39 years, so I've seen my share of bloody-gutty things, but this was just too much. I had to wear a wound vac for 6 weeks and I'm still dressing it. I also had a 6cm seroma on the left which is still draining and I'm still packing twice a day. At this rate, I expect it will be mid-May, at least, before these wounds completely heal. I was out for 4 weeks with all this, had to go back to work with the wound vac--that was so much fun. Fortunately, I do not work in a hospital. I'm on the paperwork side of community health nursing. If I had worked in a hospital, I'm sure my MO wouldn't have allowed me to work during chemo, especially since I had it during the winter. I'm glad I had the chemo. I feel like between the BMX and the chemo I have given it all I've got. Now we'll just let the chips fall where they may. Good luck, whatever you decide.",

But let me try to reassure you: young breasts are prone to lumps, bumps, and rashes, and breast cancer is virtually unheard of in a 20 yr old, pregnant or not. I'm really surprised that they're going straight to biopsy, but maybe that's just an overabundance of caution on their part. Upload your ultrasound report when you get a moment, if you would. It will help us know how to respond to you. At your age, the risk of breast cancer is less than 0.1%, even with family history. The chances that this is totally BENIGN are greater than 99.9%.

So those visits took a little over an hour--the radiologist has to read the mammogram, then has to look at the ultrasound pics. Sometimes he also did own ultrasound, if he wanted more information.  My last visit to the breast center for a diagnostic mammogram was about 3 hours, however. The diagnostic mammogram took about 30 min because the tech had to get extra images for the radiologist. Then he wanted an ultrasound. I knew when I felt her going over the same place over and over that there was a problem. Then the radiologist came in and went over it again for about 20 min, clicking on pictures. I could clearly see the mass on the ultrasound and it didn't look at all good.  When she was done, the ultrasound tech told me to dress and she would take me to a conference room to talk to the radiologist--I knew right then that this was very serious. I had never had to talk with the radiologist before. So, the radiologist went over his findings and recommended a biopsy. They set that up for the next day (Friday) and on Monday my PCP called me with the bad news. You may or may not need 3 hours for your mammogram, but since your doctor recommended it I would block that time out just in case you need it. ",

The reason I ask is the meds are different. Tamoxifen seems to have a lot of SEs and it's used in women who are still having menses. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are used in women who no longer have periods. They can also have SEs, but in my opinion not as harsh as Tamoxifen. I have taken Femara for almost 2 years. I already had arthritis, so I have some joint pain. It's not any worse than before. I have actually lost about 20-lbs in the last year. My hair came back from chemo fuller and with more body. Its still very fine, no change there. My sister has been on Arimidex (another AI) for 5+years and she hasd no SEs, whatsoever. It looks like your cancer is early stage, which means you have very good odds. You'll know more once they get the lump out. Try to hang in there. I know it's not easy, but don't give in to the what ifs? They will destroy your energy.",

Hopefully, this will turn out to be benign. The only way to know for sure is to have a biopsy.

My experience with chemo was much better than I anticipated. It's not like on TV, with the constant vomiting and gray colored skin. I had some nausea, but my MO have me meds for that. I never vomited and I looked great throughout. I did lose my hair and I was fatigued off and on, but for the most part it was business as usual. I think I missed about 5 says of work during chemo. I will be taking a hormone suppressant, Femara, for 10 years. I also needed a double mastectomy and I will need a hysterectomy, all due to some serious gene mutations and awful family history. Otherwise, I would have just had lumpectomy radiation, and Femara.",

I would think that you might want to pursue that, since your sister had BC at a young age (twice!) If you decide to get tested, I would strongly suggest that you have the expanded testing, and here's why: I have a strong family history of breast (youngest: age 24), colon, uterine, lung and other cancers in my first & second generation family members, both sides. My BS suggested I have the 5-gene test which came back negative for the BRCAs and three others. Yay~! But then my genetics counselor recommended that I also have a 25-gene test because of the numerous colon cancers in my family. Well, what do you know~! It turned up TWO rare gene mutations which cause BC and other cancers--in fact, all the cancers represented in my family can be caused by one or the other of these gene mutations! As a result of finding these two rare gene mutations, my treatment plan changed from LX & rads, to PBMX. I'm really glad I got the testing. PALB2 and Chek2 are much more rare than the BRCAs, and almost no one outside the Breast Cancer community has ever even heard of them. But in my case, given my family history, the genetics counselor pegged my lifetime risk of 45+%. My 24yo DD decided to get tested and wouldn't you know, she has them, too. In fact, her lifetime risk is 58+%~! It's sad to know that my DD has this, but at least she will have the close surveillance she needs and MAYBE she won't have to go through this whole sordid breast cancer experience. I wish you the best.",

If you decide to get the testing done, I would recommend that you get the expanded test, not just the BRCA genes. My family is just rife with cancers of all kinds, but mainly lung, colon, pancreatic, and breast. I came up negative for the BRCAs, but positive for PALB2 (pathway to BRCA2) and Chek2 and guess what? They cause lung, colon, pancreatic, and breast cancers (and others, including lymphoma.)

I'm a mother of adult children. I would be devastated if they put their lives on hold and ceased to function because they feared I had cancer. Heck, after my diagnosis, when my DD and DH decided they would shave their heads in support of me during chemo, I wasn't having it! I appreciated their concern, but I just didn't want to be reminded of my cancer every time I looked at their bald heads. What I needed and what they thought I needed were two different things. They wanted to shave their heads so they would feel like they were doing something, not because it would actually make my treatment better. I subscribe to the \"I'll be upset when there's something to be upset about\" routine. This isn't cancer until pathology proves it. And if it is cancer, there will be plenty of time to grieve it LATER. Grieving now, when you have almost no information, is just a huge waste of life force. Put it on a shelf and leave it there for a few days. The waiting is hell, I know. Believe it or not, you'll both feel like you have more control once you have more information AND a plan in place.

There are many BENIGN conditions which will cause lumps and bumps and pain.That said, its always a good thing to get it in the habit of checking your breasts, even at age 19. Mammograms don't \"see\" through young breasts well because they tend to be dense. That's why they don't generally do mammos at your age. Ultrasound is very effective at \"seeing\" into young dense breasts. If the ultrasound comes back clear I think you can rest easy. Now, try to keep your hands busy--busy hands will keep your brain from over-worrying. Try not to touch the site constantly; that isn't helping.

Etnasgrl, if you are having second thoughts, you need to postpose surgery until you have all your questions answered and you are completely at peace with your decision. Breast cancer isn't a particularly fast moving type of cancer, so you certainly have a few weeks or months to get a second opinion. At the very least, your BS should explain to you in detail why you need to have this surgery on your perfectly good breast. I had a lumpectomy and re-excision back in Aug. Mine was up high in the tail of the breast, almost under my arm. I have a 4\" incision because my BS decided not to do an extra incision to get the SNB; most LXs are smaller. It has healed up nicely and the scar falls into the natural fold under the arm. There is no noticeable difference in the sized or shape of my breasts.",

I have very dense beasts, er, breasts, and I have probably had more than 30 call-backs since I started having mammograms 20 years ago. Even had a couple of biopsies that turned out to be nothing. But for some reason back in June I had this random thought--\"I wonder if I have breast cancer\" ,even before I had my routine mammogram. And sure enough, after a call-back and yet another biopsy, here I am. In my experience, doctors do not use euphemisms to get you to do their bidding. If they call you back, it's because they want to figure something out. All you can do is show up and let them do their thing. I am a believer in NOT grieving things until they are upon me. It's a time & energy waster. If you come up positive for breast cancer, well, there will be plenty of time to be upset. No need borrowing sorrow.",

Once you go with the mastectomy, there is no turning back. You can't put them back on. Reconstruction isn't the same as a boob job. It doesn't look the same and it doesn't feel the same. in fact, your whole chest will feel numb, possibly forever. This can really intimacy.

One surgeon decided to take the risk knowing that without surgery he would certainly die. Amazingly, DH managed to survive. So why wasn't I exorbitantly happy?

They even use it to look at the inside of a baby's heart while it's still inside the mother! Pretty cool stuff. Benign and cancerous lumps have different characteristics on ultrasound. A radiologist who reads breast imaging can generally spot the difference and if there is a level of suspicion that it might be cancerous, he would recommend biopsy. Biopsies are invasive and not without their own risks, so they aren't going to stick needles in your breast without a darn good reason to do so. Frankly, I think you are getting way ahead of the ball here. I know the waiting is hard, but you have to keep your hands and brain engaged in something other than cancer. At your age your risk of breast cancer is statistically zero. Zero. In fact, I would bet my 401k that this is ANYTHING but cancer. Hang in there. You'll have some answers in a couple of days.",

Ultrasound can often see more in the breasts than mammogram can, especially if the breasts are dense. That's why they went over the breasts and arm pits, to make sure they got a good look at everything. I'm sure if they saw something worrisome they will call your mother back for more testing or a biopsy. ",

Cancer can neither be ruled in or ruled out by mammogram, ultrasound, MRI, or any other imaging. Only a biopsy can definitively determine whether a mass is cancer or something benign.

This score is the way radiologists determine how concerned they need to be and what kind of surveillance and treatment (if any) is needed.

Try not to grieve all this right now. It's never a good use of your time and energy to grieve something that has not happened and may never happen. If it turns out to be malignant after all, well, you'll have plenty of time to grieve then. While you're waiting try to keep your hands busy. Busy hands make for a busy brain. Anything you have to concentrate on, like sewing, painting, cleaning, or gardening. Definitely limit your internet searching--that will just lead you into a dark place and most of the information will not even apply to you.",

I have a 20 year old son with a rare chromosome disorder which renders him severely intellectually impaired, hearing & vision impaired, and with a seizure disorder. We had always imagined that he would live with us forever. Then, as it dawned on us that he was growing taller & stronger, but not gaining new skills as the years went by, we began to say, \"Maybe we will try to place him when he turns 35\" (at which point we would be 75.) Then he hit his growth spurt and we thought, \"Well, maybe when he's 30.\" Good round number. And we have two older kids who were always willing to help us. Then my husband became permanently disabled with stage 4 lung and heart disease. His health is steadily diminishing every year. Eight years ago we were able to take the kids on a cross country RV trip. Today, DH struggled to walk out to the mailbox and back. He can no longer help with my son, other than to feed him. No bathing, diapering, dressing, exercising. And I can't keep up with it. This man-child is 6'3\" tall--fully a foot taller than me--and strong as any normal 20 year old man! And suddenly we realized that waiting until he turned 30 to place him was going to be a terrible idea for everyone!. Fortunately, I saw the light when he was about 15. One day I saw our lives as others see us and it was SOBERING. The best thing we ever did was begin the journey to find a permanent home away from home for our son. It took us another year to get the state to approve the voucher, and then another 8 months to find the right home (cuz, he's my baby and I will not settle for less than the best.) But when we found the right family, it was like magic. Everything about it was right, now to the white bedspreads on the twin beds--the exact same set up in his home bedroom. I know, freaky, right>! Our dear boy has lived there for 3 years now and it has been a God-send for all of us. Last year, DH very nearly died when his mitral valve decompensated. He was hospitalized at Thanksgiving when his lungs became infected with a very common organism and tried to kill him with pneumonia--that took him until May to recover. What would we have done if we had also had the daily care of our son? He has been spared all these medical crises, and although he would not begin to understand the details, he is very sensitive to our moods. Now his life just goes on and some days we show up and take him to Cracker Barrel for dinner, maybe do some toy shopping at Walmart. Then we go to a hotel with an indoor pool, let him splash around in his life jacket for a bit. Spend the night, then get up and go do errands in the morning, let him buy his snacks and some flowers for his host mom, whom he dearly loves. It's not the life I had thought we would have, but it's a great life for our son. And now when we go see him, we can just be his loving parents and enjoy our son! Rosevalley, you have given your daughter such a gift. I can't give you any advice that you don't already know. I think we all worry about having to deal with the issues of death & dying with regard to our special needs kids. When my father died, we didn't think my son could possibly understand what was going on. But after the funeral he walked down the hall, threw himself on my father's pillow and WAILED his heart out until he cried himself to sleep. Never sell these kids short. They know a lot more than they can express. Blessings go beside you, in front of you, and behind you as you walk this road. Cathy",

However, there are a few on this board who got a BIRADs5 and did NOT have cancer. Hold on to that, but prepare yourself for the possibility of bad news. You asked why...my doctor told me this: You are female, you are over 55 and you have breasts. And I'm telling you the same. Nothing you did caused this. Breast cancer is just bad luck. If it does turn out to be cancer, just know that you CAN do this. You can. Honestly, I'd rather have breast cancer, than a heart attack. Breast cancer is very treatable, and although we fear it, it is unlikely to kill you outright. In fact, the majority do NOT die from it. Some of the treatment can be hard, but to tell the truth, you've already been through worse and thrived. Most women need surgery and radiation, or surgery only, and a daily anti-hormone pill. A small minority will need chemo, which isnt fun, but its doable. Hang in there. I'm sure it is difficult to go through this alone, but you can do it. Once you have answers and a plan for treatment you will feel much more in control.",

On the way home from her office, we stopped off at the pharmacy to pick up bandaging supplies when suddenly the hematoma broke open. OMG. So much blood. I looked like I had been stabbed! Thankfully, it was all old blood, so a pressure dressing did the trick. But, really. Yuck! A week later, I went back to surgery for a re-excision, plus evacuation of this huge hematoma--the BS got another 350ml (11-oz.) blood from the breast. About 5 days later, I could hear and feel a sloshing in the breast, which, of course, was a large seroma. It was big as a lemon under my arm. I went into the office and the BS removed 300ml (10-oz.) of fluid. Two days later, it suddenly burst open and lymph fluid came gushing out like a small fountain. Thankfully, I was at home! All I could do was just mash as much fluid out as possible and slap on a pressure dressing. Three days later, I woke with a 103+ degree fever and the seroma fluid looked absolutely disgusting--majorly infected. I felt like the walking dead. Sigh...it was very stubborn to heal, partly because I still had a lot of fluid in there. The BS finally had to put in a drain. I had to take 3 rounds of powerful antibiotics to finally start feeling like a normal person. The drain came out 2 weeks ago and there is still some fluid in the seroma. There is a small open area in my incision which sometimes feels a little wet, but it's not wetting my bra or shirt. The BS has already tried suturing the opening, and it did get smaller, but there is still that small open area that will just have to heal from the inside. I start chemo in 4 days, so I'm really crossing my fingers and toes that this thing doesn't get re-infected.",

Both your ER & PR are strongly positive, which is a good thing--Because your cancer is responsive/receptive to female hormones, they can be switched off with medication.. ER+/PR+ means you are much more likely to have a very treatable \"garden variety\" breast cancer. Many of these cancers are treated with lumpectomy, plus radiation or mastectomy alone, plus a daily pill to suppress your hormones. As for why they wait on the Oncotype, i can tell you this: the Oncotype they did after my biopsy was ER+ and weakly PR +, enough that it was classified as fully positive. That meant all i needed was lumpectomy, radiation, and a pill, and I'd be out the door. Go, me! Well, after my lumpectomy, they re-ran the Oncotype and discovered that the weakly positive PR was now completely negative, which is a more aggressive type of BC. My MO took it before the hospital tumor board, where the consensus was that i needed chemo. In the meantime, genetic testing revealed two rare gene mutations, so now I needed 4 rounds of chemo followed by BMX. Foo! Hang in there. I know the wheels of medicine are turning slowly. Hopefully, they can get you into surgery before Oct, just for your peace of mind.",

I suppose cytoxan might be used, but I've never heard of NOT having surgery for BC. It's usually the first treatment, unless the tumor is large and aggressive. Then they give chemo first (usually by IV) to shrink the tumor, and follow it up with surgery. It sounds like you and your daughter already have a strained relationship, so maybe she's just not giving you much information. But what she does share with you sounds a little off to me. Hopefuly I have just misunderstood.",

I can see you're upset, but you really dont have enough information to draw a conclusion. Your biopsy was inconclusive. No one, not even your surgeon and certainly not someone on a message board, will be able to tell you definitively whether you have DCIS until you have the excision. Once they get the mass out they will cut it into tiny slices and look at them all with a microscope. After that your surgeon will make recommendations regarding treatment and surveillance. At this point about all you can do is sit tight, breathe, and try to distract yourself.",

I asked him about tumor markers, but he said he doesn't use them for people with early stage cancers because of the high rate of inconclusive results. If you get a result that's a little outside the norm, you have to do a bunch more tests to determine whether that initial result is a true problem or just an aberration.

Rather than just assuming that this lump is fibroadenoma, he wants to know exactly what this is. I wouldn't read a lot into his decision. In fact I think his decision was a good one. Just remember this: It's not cancer until they it's say it's cancer. Stay off Dr Google -- there's a lot of scary misinformation out there and none of it is going to do you any good. Breastcancer.org is the only place I would recommend to get factual information. Right now try to not focus on breast cancer. Do not grieve something that has not and may not even happen to you.",

My point is that of the thousands of people I've sent to surgery exactly ONE didn't make it, a child with extreme heart defects. He was too sick and they couldnt save him. Anesthesiologists are very skilled at their job. They put hundreds of people to sleep every month without issue--babies to senior citizens. The fact that you are young and in good health is vastly in your favor. The biggest issue that long surgery might cause is nausea or vomiting, which is no fun. But there are many meds to counteract that and most people respond well to them. While you're recovering make sure you do your deep breathing to expand your lungs nicely and move your legs frequently to prevent blood clots. Incidentally, I've had 14 surgeries. Never had a problem waking up. Never had breathing trouble or blood clots. Just nausea. Best of luck to you. I think you're gonna be okay.",

If I'm understanding your post correctly, they cannot seem to determine whether this mass is simply still-developing breast tissue or something more concerning. As you probably already know, your risk of breast cancer at age 20 is virtually zero. Not that it could never, ever happen, but your risk is something like > 0.1%, which means that there's a 99.9% chance that this is ANYTHING else. Breasts start growing during puberty and they don't stop until around age 22-25. Young breasts are prone to lots of benign lumps and bumps caused by mastitis, infections, and fibroadenomas.

I normally wear gel nails, but I did not want to risk infections during chemo, so I just went with regular nail polish and what I call \"gentle\" manicures and pedicures. No clipping cuticles or digging around toenails. My nails were fine afterward, if a little more brittle, no discoloration. As they grew out after chemo there was a definite horizontal line on the nails. I've had that happen before after serious illness or surgery. Once that line grew out entirely my nails were completely back to normal.",

I highly doubt that insurance would pay for the test twice, anyway. At 36, the Oncotype is well beyond intermediate level. I would expect that your mom is going to be advised chemo, for sure.

I have an exceptionally strong family history of BC and other cancers. As such, my 23yo DD decided to be tested and wouldn't you know, she also came up positive for both. I am beyond heart-broken for her that she has to deal with this, and that I gave it to her. I'm sure your parents feel the same way (you had to get it from one or the other.) I took my DD to see my BS so she could get a plan of surveillance. She will need yearly US and yearly mammogram, even though she has very dense breasts--she has terrible insurance and a high deductible, so she cannot afford the MRI her BS ordered. Pity, because I have an aunt who had BC at 24. I can't remember exactly the progression of purported intervention, but I do know that the BS mentioned stepping up pro-active measures at age 30, hormone suppression, I think, followed by preventative BMX and hysterectomy after age 35. DD says she doesn't want children, but you know, she's young and could very well change her mind in her 30s. I didn't want kids either at 23, but by 30 it was a whole different ball game.

Right now, y'all are in the worst place--you have a little bit of knowledge, but no firm plan. Most of us felt adrift, angry, and devastated by the news. Once we had a plan in place, it often felt like we were taking back some control in our lives. Everyone here is alive, whether we're at stage 1 or stage 4. We have all chosen to LIVE our lives to the best that we can, under the circumstances. Depression is quite common with a diagnosis of a serious illness. Just know that there is treatment.

I get that you're trying to feel prepared, just in case. As has been pointed out, breast cancer is not just one disease. It is many diseases with many treatment options. You don't need to scare yourself needlessly. We have saying here: \"Its not cancer until pathology proves it.\" Don't borrow trouble. There will be plenty of time for investigation, should this indeed be cancer.",

But try to remember that lumps are just lumps until a doctor says otherwise. And stay off Dr. Google! He is no friend.  The first step to determining what's going on is to take antibiotics. If the lump goes away, great! You just had an infected hair follicle or other minor infection. If the lump comes and goes with your period, then it's probably a bit of breast tissue that's responding to your hormone fluctuations.   If the lump remains or gets bigger, then it's time for an ultrasound and maybe a biopsy.  You don't say how old you are, but I'm guessing your grandmother was at least in her 60s.  Breast cancer is much, much more common in older, post-menopausal women, so it really doesn't raise your own risk, necessarily (assuming that you don't have any other BC in the family.)",

Are there others in your family who have had colon cancer?    Has anyone mentioned having some genetic testing?  There are panels that test multiple genes, including mutations that cause colon cancer and other cancers.  My family history is just rife with breast, colon, lung, thyroid, uterine, and pancreatic cancers. I had a 32-gene panel which revealed 2 rare gene mutations, both of which cause breast cancer and individually cause colon, thyroid, pancreatic, lung and other cancers.  Of course, I'm not happy about it, but at least I know and can get better surveillance.  I had a preventive BMX (the LX actually got all the cancer) and total hysterectomy. My children were tested and my 23yo DD came up positive for the same gene mutations, so that sucks. But she has begun breast surveillance now and will have the opportunity to do some things medically and surgically when the time comes (10-15 years from now) and maybe she will never have to go through breast cancer and chemo.",

That means that there's a 99.9% chance of this being anything other than cancer. Can it happen? Sure. I have an aunt who was diagnosed at age 24--in 1912! She lived well into her 90s and died of dementia. Nipples come in all shapes and sizes. Most nipples poke out, but some turn in, called \"inverted nipples.\" They are not dangerous and really don't cause trouble, unless you're trying to breastfeed. You're doing the right thing having this checked, since its a new finding. We all need to be in touch with our bodies. But i would be very surprised to hear of a 25 yr old with no family history having breast cancer. Not that it can't happen, but it is very, very rare.",

I was BRCA negative, but PALB2 and Chek2 positive--my genetics counselor estimated that my risk had been 45+%, about the same as BRCA2.  I was fortunate that my insurance company didn't bat an eye at the cost.  My 23yo DD also tested positive for PALB2 and Chek2--her risk is estimated at 58+%.  Her insurance didn't pay any of it, but she applied for a hardship discount and the company (Ambry) paid the entire bill.

My breast cancer is not the same as someone else's, even if we have similar stats. My sister had breast cancer 6 years ago. She had a lumpectomy and radiation. She came through with flying colors.

As far as side effects, they weren't too bad for the most part. In fact, actually getting the chemo was a piece of cake--it was painless and I was able to complete my work on my laptop while the poison did its job. Of course, about 3-4 days later, the fatigue would set in and my taste buds changed for about 10 days. I ran fever a couple times and had to go to the ER. But, mostly my life went on. I am fortunate to be able to work from home a lot, and to have a very understanding boss. As such, I have only had to take about 5-6 sick days since Oct.

You do not have to ask permission or even tell them that you are seeking a second opinion. They should be grown-up enough to not take it personally. I actually did experience this. My PS had discussed implants with me about 6 months ago and I said no, I do not want foreign bodies implanted in my body. Period. When I went to pick up my records to take to another PS, she overheard me and came storming out of a room to berate me in front of God and everybody. She said, \"I told you I can just pop some implants in there!\" Yeah, I know what you said. I left with my records and never looked back. I did see a second PS, who also wanted to \"pop in some implants\", so I sought out a 3rd opinion, this time from the group in NOLA. They do DIEP flaps all day, every day, which is what I wanted in the first place. I don't care at all that my original PS is pissed with me. She can go sit on a tack!",

When the initial tests for BRCA came back okay, we proceeded with the lumpectomy. Unfortunately, later some other results showed that I had two rare gene mutations, PALB2 and Chek2, which raise my risks substantially. So, now that I'm done with chemo, I'll be having a BMX in Feb 2016, followed by an oophorectomy or hysterectomy later this year. I wish I had known prior to the lumpectomy. I would definitely have chosen mastectomy over watchful waiting every 6 months for the rest of my life. As my MO said, \"You're breasts are gonna try to kill you, sooner or later.\" Yikes!",

I think healthcare professionals are slowly coming to understand that we don't stop caring about ourselves once we get the senior discounts. I am 60. I wear makeup and earrings every day, no matter what. I like for my clothes to fit decently and my hair to look reasonably fresh. Breast cancer came in and destroyed my sense of femininity. I had very large breasts from the time they came in (age 11, so much fun...) So far, I have had 3 cancer surgeries, with at least 2-3 to go, 4 rounds of chemo, lost all my hair, and developed carpal tunnel syndrome due to breast cancer treatments. At this point my hair is about 2-3\" long and curly, not my usual stick-straight, so I find it hard to work with. I had planned to live flat after my BMX, but later found that wearing soft knitted prosthetics (Knitted Knockers) improved my confidence exponentially. So, now I am seeking out reconstruction. Who knew I could be so vain? I'm old, gray, and fat, with bad knees. Why do I even care? Nobody is looking at me anyway. Or at least, that had been my thought. And then I had an epiphany--if by \"nobody\" I mean \"men\", well, do I really need that kind of validation? Maybe there is another lady like me out there who looks at her old, saggy body and thinks they need a role model--well, here I am! I will continue to dress nicely, wear makeup, and try not to look dumpy, so I can support other ladies who may be going through similar experiences, regardless whether a man thinks I look fine or not. As to your questions: 1) Will my BC return after mastectomy? How can it return if I don't even have a breast? Mastectomy takes out as much breast tissue as possible, but there can be small cells left behind. It is uncommon, but recurrence does happen. 2) Do I still need radiation if I had mastectomy? Maybe, maybe not. For many women, the answer is thankfully, no. In my case, my treatment plan changed from lumpectomy, plus radiation, to chemo, plus BMX (plus full hyst, due to gene mutations.) 3) The pro and cons about reconstruction. This you will have to research on your own. You are the only one who knows how much reconstruction means to you. but from your description it sounds like it would mean very much. Don't discount your feelings about this. 4) The cost of reconstruction if it is not covered by insurance . I believe that US federal law requires health insurance companies to pay for breast reconstruction following any lumpectomy or mastectomy, minus your deductible. 5) The effectiveness of reconstruction. When you are ready, you can Google reconstruction and find pretty much any kind of picture you want. Sure, some will be more graphic, especially if the lady had complications. But most look pretty good. Keep in mind that breast reconstruction isn't usually one & done. It usually takes a minimum of 2 surgeries to get the right look, and some ladies have had upwards of 7-9 to get theirs perfect for them. For instance, I thought when you got implants it was forever. Nope. They last 7-10 years, then you have to replace them. Do I want to do that every 10 years, at my age? Best of luck to you. I see you're in chemo now. Go ahead and buy a good wig now, so when the day comes sometime in the next 2 weeks, you'll be ready.",

It's also possible that you DO have mastitis--its not just a condition for pregnant or breastfeeding women. At any rate, an ultrasound is in order and is very accurate in young, dense breasts. Its non-invasive and not particularly painful. You'll just lie on your back while the tech moves a wand over the breasts and underarms. At least your age is on your side. Your risk of breast cancer is virtually zero. Young breasts can have lots of wonky lumps, rashes, and dimples caused by benign conditions like mastitis, cysts, and fibroadenomas. And hormones also play their part. Good luck with your ultrasound Wed. Let us know how it turns out.",

Breast cancer is generally slow-growing. My guess is that she probably had had it for years, undiagnosed, for it to have progressed so ultra-rapidly. My suggestion to you is that you have them seen by a breast specialist. Obgyns don't necessarily have the skill set to evaluate breasts thoroughly. As to whether you need a mammogram and a biopsy, I think probably not. Young breasts are generally very dense. The best first test for young breasts is ultrasound. They don't want to go poking around inside a breast unless they see something suspicious, because it always leaves behind small scars which can mimic lumps.",

We went through something similar about 15 years ago, when my DH became desperately ill, went into septic shock and nearly died. I was homeschoolong my 10 & 16 year olds, working part-time as a nurse, and managing our 8yo who has severe disabilities. Although I wasn't the sick one I was beside myself with grief and fear for my husband's life. I couldnt concentrate and I needed to be at the hospital as much as possible (DH didn't know where he was or what was happening to him.) My kids were basically watching \"The Lion King\" and reading comic books all day for a few weeks there. When DH came home from the ICU he was weak as a kitten and required my full attention. I took a good assessment of my life and realized the my kids were beginning to suffer from the stress. The 8yo was already in school. I got the other two enrolled and I was amazed at how well they adjusted. A teacher noticed that my 10yo seemed a little withdrawn and got her promptly into a school-based support group for kids undergoing extreme changes (divorce, death of a parent, homelessness). It was called Friendship Club, and she had no idea that it was a therapeutic group. She just thought they met to do crafts and make friends. I can't even describe the physical relief I felt after making this decision. We finished out the school year with the kids in public school. By the next fall their dad was steadily recovering and I was back in the saddle. We resumed homeschooling without missing a beat. I wish you peace, in whatever form you may need, to get through this. Having gone through this cancer experience myself, I can only imagine how difficult this is for you.",

If you do have genetic testing, ask for one of the expanded panels. The small 5-gene panel only includes the BRCAs and three other most common gene mutations.

The size and stage are also factors in determining treatment. Some cancers respond well to lumpectomy and radiation. Some require mastectomy or chemo. Most require hormone suppression meds, but not all. There is no one-size-fits-all course of treatment.

      "Content": "Nov 7, 2015 06:36PM - edited Nov 7, 2015 06:38PM by mustlovepoodles When I found out I had BC (IDC) in late July 2015, I immediately asked for genetic testing. There are 19 first & second degree relatives in my family who have had some form of cancer (other than skin cancers, which I don't count.) My father's mother had cervical, uterine, breast, and colon cancer; her 6 siblings all had cancer, either lung, colon, or breast, or a combination of that. I have a cousin on my father's side who had male breast cancer. On my mother's side I have 2 aunts who had BC before age 50 (one was only 24!), plus several with lung, colon, pancreatic cancers, and lymphoma. I am the second of 4 sisters to have BC and one sister has had uterine cancer. When the first test came back negative for the BRCA genes, we had a little celebration. Woot! But 2 weeks later the second test came back, which looked for the more obscure BC genes, plus colon, lung, pancreatic, etc, and came back positive for PALB2 and Chek2. PALB2 is the pathway to the BRCA 2 gene. The genetics counselor estimated my risk for BC at a whopping 45%~! Had I known that, I would have had a PBMX several years ago. As it is, I have had 2 lumpectomies (before we knew about the genes) and I am now going through chemo. Radiation may still be in the cards. I will be on estrogen suppression for at least 10 years. There is no way of knowing whether I will have BC again--having it once makes me susceptible to having it again, even without the bad genes-- so I'm planning to have the BMX after chemo is finished. I wouldn't wish this on anyone.",

The right breast ended up with severe tissue necrosis and the left breast had a gigantic seroma. If I had had reconstruction I would have lost it all. I had thought I would go for some type of reconstruction, but I'm actually becoming more and more comfortable going flat. At my age (59)nobody really cares about my boobage. I decided to not make any decision about it until January 1st. My wounds are just now finishing healing from my mastectomies; it's been 16 weeks. I'm going to give the whole area a good long time to rest before I do anything else. As far as the scarring you can only imagine how awful it looks on me. My situation is not very common. I had a lot of complications that most women don't have. I have to tell you, my scars are hideous. I don't even like to look at myself. So it's very possible that I may be having revisions in the future, but not now. Incidentally, I home-schooled for nine years. If you can do that, you can manage this. Best of luck to you.",

It was tapped many times, and then it got infected. Six weeks, so much fun. Not. If you're bothered by leakage, put a pad in your bra. I cut a thin maxi-pad in half and stuck it inside my bra, sticky side down. Easy to change and no one will be the wiser. I don't think it much matters about whether you express the fluid or not.

I have had enough diarrhea that I take something every day to keep it in control (no accidents~!) The fatigue has been pretty tough at times. I've had to go to the ER a couple times for high fevers, and got antibiotics. But for the most part, my life goes on pretty much normally. The big thing for me has been the fatigue. When it hits, I could lay down right in the road. But I'm not sleepy. Just bone weary. It has affected me during this holiday season because I just don't have the stamina to really cook like I normally would. Most Christmases, I'm in the kitchen every day making cookies and pies. This year, Pepperidge Farm is making my cookies. Just as well--cookies taste weird to me right now. I've been fortunate to have friends who have brought in meals from time to time, especially during chemo weeks. Anyway, that's my way of trying to say, hang in there. None of us wants to have chemo, radiation or surgery, but here we are. My particular cancer is moderately aggressive, plus I have 2 gene mutations, so my MO is being VERY aggressive with my treatment. Do I love it? well, no. But I want to give it all I've got, because as my MO told me, if it comes back it will be incurable. I can't control whether it will recur or when, but by golly!

I think it's pretty normal to have some anxiety, but it sounds like yours has gone off the charts. You're doing lots of things, but it seems that nothing non-medicinal is working for you. I know you said you don't want to take anti-anxiety medicine, but this may be the time to consider it. Taken judiciously, anti-anxiety meds can be a real boon to get you through this tough time. I'm not a fan of taking them all the time, due to the risk of habituation, but if you're only taking it during this time of uncertainty (situational anxiety) habituation is an extremely low risk. (I have taken them off and on since I got this diagnosis, myself. So far it's been all benefit and no down-side.) As you may already know, breast cancer is a fairly low risk for women who have no family history of breast cancer, around 12% over the course of your lifetime. Women over 65 have a higher risk, but it's not substantially higher. That would mean you have about an 88% chance of NOT having breast cancer. The way I look at it, if I had a 12% of being diagnosed with breast cancer over my lifetime, but an 88% chance of winning the breast lottery (NOT having breast cancer), I'd be hoofing it to get that mammogram. Better to know than not know, in my humble opinion. Good luck to you.I hope you keep your appointment so you can enjoy your holiday season~!",

Do your self-breast exams, too, because you really need to at least be familiar with what your own breasts feel like. My own mother, 81 years old, hasn't had a mammogram in over 15 years!

Don't read too much into the doctor's statement--he knows you're upset and he's trying to be a nice guy by coming in extra for you. As you may already know, your age is in your favor. Less than 2% of women ages 20-35 will be diagnosed with cancer. The vast majority of biopsies are totally benign. Of course, your risk is not zero, which is why they will continue to run tests until they are all proven to be either benign or malignant.",

I received some good education about depression and medications and finally accepted that, for me, medication was going to be permanent part of my life. It's been 7 years and I have not had an acute bout of depression since then. I readily accept that I will be taking these meds forever, but you know what? I don't care. I feel so normal now. I have been able to face my diagnosis without falling apart. I have been able to manage chemo and hopefully I will be able to do as well with the BMX in Jan-Feb. This is a long way of saying you don't need to feel guilty, not for taking meds and not for having an easier time than someone else. It's not a contest. As the song says, \"Let it go! LET IT GO-O-O-O...\"  ",

Starting fights over such minor things. What helped me was a mild antidepressant and time. And throwing things. And the occasional primal scream.

I also have GERD and it didn't affect that. It was more annoying than anything else. At first, the iron bra feeling drove me a little crazy. it didn't help that I had to sleep on my back for several weeks until the chest wounds healed. I didn't feel like my BMX was all that painful but I was very fatigued. I had some unusual complications that most people do not have, so my advice is to be prepared in case things go sideways. It has been almost 3 months and I am doing very well now.",

There was a time, before 1985, when women would go to sleep not knowing whether they would wake up with both breasts or only one. It was terriblly stressful, but doctors genuinely thought it was better for women to not have to undergo two surgeries, even though it meant they had no say in what would be done to their bodies. Thankfully, we live in a better century now and we understand that women have the right to decide what happens to them. No doctor in a civilized country would dare take your breast off against your will today. Can you even imagine the lawsuits? They understand now that these surgeries are safe for most healthy women and there is seldom any reason to rush to breast removal without careful consideration. Your surgeon is suggesting excisional biopsy. I think you should consider it. If you continue to have concerns about the possibility of removing your breast, bring it up with yiur surgeon so he can put your mind at ease. He won't know you are worried about this if you don't tell him.",
