A month prior to my bc diagnosis I had shoulder surgery on the same side as my uni. I had a horrible time with my restricted range of motion. That was what drove me to ridding myself of as much tissue as possible that was stiff and stuck to my ribcage and go for a DEIP a year after my mx. It wasn't fun...but I am very happy I gained back mobility. My ps in Boston does more DEIPs than any doc north of NYC. She did an amazing job! Annie, good for you for not jump to a decision that is not right for you. It's beter to hold off than later having regrets. You can always change your mind down the road and revisit the decision you are making today. It's a little more of a challenge when you decide on a reconstruction that was wrong for you.",

My daughters surgeon stood with the radiologist after a digital mammogram and a positive diagnosis of bc and the tumor was not visible and they knew its location. She was 35. Two years later, I had a \"questionable\" digital mammogram. Nothing visible just \"questionable\". Nothing palpatable. An MRI revealed a 7.5cm mass! Interstingly, the entire mass was not cancer but I was Stage3. The cancers were different varieties and this was not genetic. I was in a small research trial in Boston..an interesting choice for treatment!",
