I figure hair grows back. Id rather lose my hair than be afraid of recurrence thru the years. You will do what you have to do. Life will be good and busy in no time (from what Im told) BTW... At least you remember your path report. Mine is >1cm and hormone neg. Stage? Grade? HMMMM.. talk about wanting to go back.... Many Hugs and thoughts Gma",

The tech that took my mammograms and had to actually make the dreadful call to inform me that I needed to come in for a \"spot\" found is actually an old friend of mine. We were very close 20 years ago. It was so hard for her as well. I dont know if I really wanted the nurse to call. Today anyway. I will talk to my mammo tech friend this weekend and get some more info from her on my biopsy report. She called and gave me the report yesterday but again, I heard only half. All I remember is lower grade than they thought and it was IDC and hormone receptor negative. How many of you girls have had biopsy path reports that have been the same/close to your final path report post op? Again, the cancer is size of pencil eraser -so- >1cm i imagine. Not much tho. Good news. I called my half-sisters very old phone number that I kept after finding my birth mother. Sounds like, from the answering machine, its her and her family still. Not only will this help in my final decision but I can warn her. My birth mom got pg w/ her 3 months after she put me up for adoption. She kept her. We are the only children she gave birth too. Would the genetic testing have to be a special procedure they would have to have done? Will medical records of any type help? Im not quite sure if birth mom would have testing done. She had a very difficult life. Lets just say I am very glad she chose to find me a good home. I thought I would at least start w/ my half-sis and ask about cancer in fam and go from there. I feel like my whole body is riddled w/ cancer. Im afraid it is in my chest wall, my lungs, ovaries, back. I am sore all over. Stress? A very hard day. Funny thing? A few months ago I was dx'ed w/ SEVERE Sleep apnea. It has been w/ me for years and I have HBP and Irregular heart rate w/ anxiety due to it. Ive had my machine for a month and felt a little better off and on but still had insomnia. Day I was dx'ed? I slept 81/2 hours straight and have slept at least 61/2 each night since. Im even scared for just surgery alone. Overweight 50 lbs, weak heart, not much exercise since my wreck (hip pn) and a few minths ago my ankles started to swell a little right at my cycle time. Water retention I guess. Docs didnt seem to worried. I had a few other questions for you all but my eyes are blurry and Im having trouble remembering what I was going to ask. WOW, I sound like a 2 year old. Thanks for listening again. I .sure appreciate the hugs. Gma-Toni ",

She will go to appts even and take notes and just be there for you when you need her. She will call doc offices even when you are wondering where test results are, ect. I did find out a bit of different info.... The cancer is hormone + not negative which I first thought. Better I guess..... how any of this can be better I dont know so......

She was 6 mon pregnant and my first grandson lived only 9 days. The man that hit her hasnt been charged yet and it was a year ago in March. My daughter is a walking miracle.

The years have been very difficult and my daughter is still recovering. Now this? I am ready to give up. I am a very strong person and realize I have to fight but am so tired of heartache. So far all I know is the grade of the tumor is lower than they thought. It is small, the size of a pencil eraser and it is IDC w/ hormone involvement. You really do not know how bad it is until the final path report comes after surgery, I imagine. My fear is the same of so many other women here. I have been through so much that the lower my chances for recurrence, the better I will feel. I am actually considering a mastectomy instead of lumpectomy. It is on my right breast an inch above my nipple. I see the surgeon on tuesday (6/16). then schedule surgery, I guess. My breasts are large and droopy. Size C cup but still heavy. I am so lost, scared, devastated and actually in a little denial. God doesnt give us any more than we can handle? Hmmmm.... I want to see my children grow more and actually hold my next grandchild.

I am pretty sure I have decided on a Right sided MX. I meet w/ my surgeon on 7/2 (oops said wrong date before) and will schedule surgery that day. This will be my 2nd appt w/ him. It is Federal Law for Insurance to cover breast reconstruct post-surgery. Both breasts if wanted. Some insurances (Ive been told- but not many) will cover only at the time of surgery - not farther down the road - but it is law to cover breast reconstruction. I have a large droopy \"boob\" on the left and I have worried about that. I dont care about losing my other breast. But I am seeing a PS next week to consider \"shrinking\" my left side. I just dont know if Im up to all the desicions. Just want it out! I have been so out of it today running around, Id like to talk to you more!

I am needing the \"easiest\" reconstruct and reduct I can get. I have enough skin to do a skin sparing MX w/ immediate implant (I think). When do they do the left side?  I have had the opportunity to see the cosmetic looks of both post-surgerys.

I feel better and the dark circles are almost gone from under my eyes ! Mary, thanks for asking, yes I saw the PS and BS yesterday. I was so impressed. I will have R MX w/ immediate recon as well. I will be doing implants as my health is not as \"good\" as it used to be. TRAM and the other ops just werent for me. I will do a lift and reduct on L and recon on R. I know both docs very well considering I worked w/ them both for 14 yrs. Seen their work too. I feel like this big huge weight has been lifted. Still queazy bout the canser (any newcomers, I love to spell that wrong) but having a plan has made such a difference. In order for both docs to be in surg at same time they do have to coordinate their schedules so looks like week of July 20th now. Little longer than I wanted but only bout 6-7 weeks post diagnosis. Beachgirl- yes, will be thinking of you and hope your u/s is soon. Mary is so right, we are the same women we were last week. That was one of my hardest lessons. In fact, I am a better woman.I feel, for the first time in my life, that I am living in the moment. You come back anytime and post your heart away. So many caring women here and so much knowledge. Hugs to you all, Gma - Toni Dawn - Love you ! Sharon- Always on my mind !",

Did I tell you that he is 6 years younger than I? GGrrrrrrr...... Robbing the cradle, well, robbed it 18 yrs ago! Just celebrated our 18th year of being together. My DH is a romantic. We celebrate the day we met (July 3) and our wedding anniversary ! My question is, does anybody find it harder to be at family get togethers since their DX? You would think I would have felt at peace being around all the people I love. Instead, it was a tough day. My mind played tricks on me. Ya know, where will I be next year? Will I be with the ones I love? I became overwhelmed at the party, although hid it quite well. Just looked into everyones eyes like it was the first time I had ever seen them I know we change as women (men) after this disease. Become better than we once were. Appreciate all parts of life. Will I calm down a bit after surgery and after I know what my plan of attack is going to be ? I assume I will but getting there is like living a day to day nightmare. I do apologize to any new comers if I am scaring anyone. Maybe you feel this way as well sometimes and its normal too. Will I always live in fear or am I just having a tough day and its only 7 am ? Better go take my happy pill now huh? Whine, whine, whine. Hey, anyone see a good movie lately? DVD or movie house, doesnt matter. Get my mind rolling in a different direction would be nice today. Well, Shit. Oops, sorry but that felt good. @@@@Hugs@@@@ Gma - Toni  Edited to fix typos - GEEZZZZ !!",

I am 44, adopted and have been through hell in the last 5 years and now BC !! My daughter was in an awful MVA and sustained a severe head injury. She was 6 mon pregnant and my first grandson lived only 9 days. The man that hit her hasnt been charged yet and it was a year ago in March. My daughter is a walking miracle. She was NOT supposed to live. I was in a similar accident and fractured my (R) hip, pelvis and numerous ribs. I had to stop working 2 1/2 years ago. My husband was injured at work 2 years ago. The years have been very difficult and my daughter is still recovering. Now this? I am ready to give up. I am a very strong person and realize I have to fight but am so tired of heartache. So far all I know is the grade of the tumor is lower than they thought. It is small, the size of a pencil eraser and it is IDC w/ hormone involvement. You really do not know how bad it is until the final path report comes after surgery, I imagine. My fear is the same of so many other women here. I have been through so much that the lower my chances for recurrence, the better I will feel. I am actually considering a mastectomy instead of lumpectomy. It is on my right breast an inch above my nipple. I see the surgeon on tuesday (6/16). then schedule surgery, I guess. My breasts are large and droopy. Size C cup but still heavy. I am so lost, scared, devastated and actually in a little denial. God doesnt give us any more than we can handle? Hmmmm.... I want to see my children grow more and actually hold my next grandchild. Thanks if even one person listened to my pity party. All of you are strong, beautiful women. Always, Toni --- The heart is the hub of all sacred places....Go there and roam in it !

Birth farther had none on his side 20 years ago. Got alot of soul searching to do... I can see the onc as well before surgery if I want to. No further tests need to be done. Just need to really realize this is happening and do some searching and then off I go to fight my battle. Today, so far, my attitude is strong. I will fight this. I will win.(is that the valium talking?) I will make it through this. HEY- what does DH stand for in posting? thought was daughter but now I think its husband. Which is it or am I way off?

Makes me feel quite special. My first TX was wednesday. I went to the hospital and so I get my own private room, bed, room service meal (yeah!) own potty and a recliner for DH. Takes bout 5 hours there compared to doc office but doc office was $1200.00 copay. Ouch. Each time for poop sakes. 3 more txs to do - be done before Thanksgiving. No I do not regreat my decision. I had a 24 oncotype DX score (I know you knew that, Sharon) but wanted to let ya all know,  ((HUGS)) Toni PS I will keep you all posted - Hey - no SE's yet. Little heartburn and leg weaks the first night but decided I was hungry. Little sore in back of neck today and havent slept all night Im sure are more but nothing bad !! XOXO",

I dont even see the surgeon until tuesday. Ill be in our psych ward by then.

I am also new and have yet to have my surgery. Find a good link that you feel comfortable in _ make your own even_ but dont get yourself overwhelmed w/ all the stories. I was told that in the beginning !Take what you need and give what you can, just remember we are ALL different women and men ! Life does throw everyone a few curve balls. Some a little bigger than others but it makes us who we are today.Strong, beautiful women. Mary - We sound like the droopy booby sisters! I hear yah sistah. I am thinking of that as well but remember, we are ALL different (again) I have overwhelmed myself w/ reading, googeling, ect. I am going to meet w/ a PS but am unsure of doing anything other than getting rid of the canser (love to spell it wrong- a sense of power!) I wouldnt mind looking at \"no Boobie: but thats me. I figure I can duct tape the other one up if it gives me trouble. Heck, I always can fix it later if its not right for me right now!

Three weeks from now. Not sure if I told anyone but I smoke. I know yuk!! Only about 3-4 cigs per day and not for many years but it is an embarrassing habit. Always been a closet smoker. Well, of course I have to quit. Its been hard. PS afraid of necrosis post-surgery so it definetely was a reqiurement of his. Im glad. Ive quit so many times and then it seems as tho a family health issue comes up (alot lately) and I start again. So the PS wants at least 3 weeks and no smoking. Then the PS and BS had to coordinate schedules so... July 28th is the day. Why dont I feel a little better? Its my DH bday today too. We are gonna watch a movie tonight and have dinner so that will be fun. Update - As long as Dawn posted about her surgery, I wanted to let you know she is doing well and napping right now. All the kind hugs and thoughts were appreciated , Im sure. She is a very special friend to me and I love her dearly. Sharon- Thanks for the offer, I will let you know. How nice, handmade for you.

I dont have any history of BC so my surgeon suggested that having a bilat MX woukd be too much surgery for me to endure. I am leaning toward uni MX (right) just due to stress that we have gonee thru and maybe I will have less chance of recur for a longer period of time. I just need to start thinking of reconstrct. Any more stories you can send my way would be great! ++hugs++ Yes, I am leaning towards MX more than ever now w/ reconstruct. Would have to have both sides done tho cuz of huge big boobies.Never evr liked my boobies. I think I would be alright w/ no reconstruct but again \"big left boobie would be left\". Already have so many medical conditions, would cause more pain than I need.The Lumpect sounds easier but the fear of recur would send me to the funny farm and the whole rad bit sounds terrible. If our \"heartache and tragedy\" occurences in the past 5 years would not have happened, I think I would be able to \"maybe\" not be so scared of the future ?!? I am better today and back in my battle mode. Knowing Im going to be strong and am strong to deal w/ this. Knowing I will survive. Just knowing all you strong beautiful women has made me realize that we are many. Many that will go on living and thriving and enjoying life. Its a pleasure to hear from you all and I think of you everyday. God Bless.

Not my first surgery but it still scares me. My doc says.. Why? youre going to be sleeping and I have to do all the work !! Poop head. You will wake up before you know it and then the GOOD drugs start to come ! Your surgery is before mine, bout a week. If you need to take your ativan do it. You can even break them in half. Sharon, Lucy-Hello my dear friends, thinking of you today. Dawn-Was out shopping again for some pj's and lay around clothes when you called. So nice to hear your voice. I will light a candle in the morning for you during your surgery and will be thinking of you. Probably will be pacing... Thought you may txt me this morning so wasnt expecting to hear from you, was nice. What phone service do you have? Verizon, ect ? Hey Guys - I know the boards have ideas for clothes post-MX and recon, but did something work well for any of you ladies that you could share w/ me? I really have to stay away from alot of reading as my mind plays tricks on me. Just in the last couple days or so again, weird. Will feel better after surgery (I think) Love and Hugs to you all, Toni",

I am 44, adopted and have been through hell in the last 5 years and now BC !! My daughter was in an awful MVA and sustained a severe head injury. She was 6 mon pregnant and my first grandson lived only 9 days. The man that hit her hasnt been charged yet and it was a year ago in March. My daughter is a walking miracle. She was NOT supposed to live. I was in a similar accident and fractured my (R) hip, pelvis and numerous ribs. I had to stop working 2 1/2 years ago. My husband was injured at work 2 years ago. The years have been very difficult and my daughter is still recovering. Now this? I am ready to give up. I am a very strong person and realize I have to fight but am so tired of heartache. So far all I know is the grade of the tumor is lower than they thought. It is small, the size of a pencil eraser and it is IDC w/ hormone involvement. You really do not know how bad it is until the final path report comes after surgery, I imagine. My fear is the same of so many other women here. I have been through so much that the lower my chances for recurrence, the better I will feel. I am actually considering a mastectomy instead of lumpectomy. It is on my right breast an inch above my nipple. I see the surgeon on tuesday (6/16). then schedule surgery, I guess. My breasts are large and droopy. Size C cup but still heavy. I am so lost, scared, devastated and actually in a little denial. God doesnt give us any more than we can handle? Hmmmm.... I want to see my children grow more and actually hold my next grandchild. Thanks if even one person listened to my pity party. All of you are strong, beautiful women. Always, Toni --- The heart is the hub of all sacred places....Go there and roam in it ! Dx 6/9/2009, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/5 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

The doc thinks its just nerves and I am sure she is right. Haven't slept a wink and just can't get outta this funk. Ya know? Its ok though. It will all work out. This is weighing on me so much that I think its all just going to be alright. Angels are all around me. Wanted to catch up w/ you Lucy, and still plan on it. The tummy meds the doc gave me make me sooooo sslleeppyyyyy...zzzzzz....zzzzzzz......zzzzzzz  hmmmmm what was I saying? No really, they make me sleepy (during day) need at night, huh? I will get it together this coming week, I have too. Its week before surgery !!! Sharon, Dawn (I hope) is doing fine. Such a strong young woman. I havent bugged her cuz I know she is trying to get settled. That word doesnt even sum up everything she is having to do to get relocated again for her DH job . I am thinking of her and know I will here from her soon !!! Love and Light, Toni  (9 days and counting!)",

I am surrounded by wonderful people but yet so consummed w/ this BC. They really do have alot of support programs here in Montana. My post-op nurse comes to surgery w/ me and also reports to my family (in the wait room) how I am doing, the breast imaging nurse that initially came to my 1st appt w/ the BS and took notes, can also accompany me to surgery (the walk down the hall to meet the men in blue masks!) and then go sit w/ my family and support them, ect or stay w/ me. We have spoke quite a few times in the middle of the night after Ive woke up w/ nightmares. Ya know, Ive met great people thru here but who wants to be woke up at 3:30 in the morn w/ a lunatic on the other line when you guys have already had surgery and can actually sleep!!! That and she was right here in town and had same time zone. So just a few more days to go. Trying to hustle and get ready. Dont know what to get ready but there has to be something right... mj- so sorry to see you have to come here but glad you did. the ladies here are so awesome and supportive. I am just having a temper tantrum right now...it really has helped me to come here. Ive even made a very close friend and thats nice to care about one another. Reach out to every one, dont overwhelm yourself though, its easy to do. I did it. Dont read to much from Dr Google ! And we are all very DIFFERENT women. Lucy- Thinking of you. Dawn - Its been so long... I do miss you and hope you are well. ((HUGS)) Toni (Gma)",

Have a hematoma on the left - might have menntioned that already earlier :) See that little side smiley face I just did ? No kidding, have never known what that was until a week ago... OK, hurtung some today, 6:30 in the morning and just took a pain pill. Woooo.... Feels so nice to talk to all of you. Wish we could conference in !! Got your card Lucy, so very very sweet. OK guys, please keep me in your thoughts... need a low Onco score... no chemo if low score. Of course I will do what I need to do but if I dont need chemo... that would be refreshing. My DD (injured one) has a surgery on her arm coming up in October and I have some relatives coming to see us from Wisconsin same time.. those are my excuses, think they are strong enough for no chemo? Hoping thry are... oh, will do Tamoxifen for 5years but doc even thought there would be no chemo due to negative nodes, size of tumor (Oh I had some low grade DCIS in there too) again, will do what I need too.  Darn it, There goes my arm - numb, tingling from SNB and painful. Just had to be my dominant side, huh ? wanted to keep chatting to you guys. Did Dawn tell any of you she recently turned a year younger? Thought I would blab that. She did have surgery recently so please keep her in your thoughts, she means a lot to me. So do all of you wonderful women. Talk Soon. Hope I didnt forget anything. Always, Toni",

My second chemo TX will be Oct 6 and then I will be 50% done !! My mama got sick for a bit and lost alot of blood, became anemic and had to have a 2 pint transfusion. we admitted her into the hospital on Friday Sept 18 and she came home the next day. Wanted to keep her for observation. She looks so tired. (85yo) Im an only child and its hard right now to be there for her. Anyone thinking of just having one kid....GET OFF THE COMPUTER AND START SNUGGLING W/ YOUR HUBBY RIGHT NOW !! IM SERIOUS ITS TOUGH BEING THE ONLY CHILD. Ok, no really, I wish I had a brother or sister. Even for support right now. Im so glad my 2 daughters have each other through this, they are too. I am having no real SE's w/ the chemo (knock, knock, knock) and hope to be lucky throughout. I will finish before Thanksgiving, probably as bald as the bird. Please take care and love you all !!
