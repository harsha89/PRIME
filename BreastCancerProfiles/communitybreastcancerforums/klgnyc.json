Double mastectomy, chemo and radiation, three+ years ago and not a moment without pain since. Everyone kept telling me it was the expanders, but we swapped those out prior to radiation and it was no better. Then the plastic surgeon said it was the radiation, but the tingling around each breast and the constant squeezing iron bra feeling are really even on both sides. I've done PT for a year and half, massage, topical cream with lidocaine and other meds, acupuncture, Botox (twice), nerve blocks, a spinal block, Lyrica (made me loopy) and revision surgery in which they removed the impants and put new ones over the muscle. I'm still in pain and now on a very low dose of gabapentin which doesn't work very well, but the higher dose makes me so exhausted and I'm afraid to go off completely and be miserable again. I'm working with a therapist and doing hypnosis which seemed to be helping, but the past few weeks have been less effective. I'm taking CBD oil at night, but THC apparently lowers the efficacy of the lovely Tamoxifen I'm taking so... It's awful to think it will always be like this, and I'm sure you feel the same. I'd take the impants out in a heartbeat if anyone thought that would help, but none of my docs think it will - they're assuming the damage is from the surgeries and another won't help. So, when these things reach the end of their shelf life and have to come out, they won't be replaced. I often wonder if I'll feel better and then curse myself for not having removed them sooner. No way to know, right? I'm praying for you, and grateful to hear that you finally found something that helps a bit. It gives me hope. ",

Thing is, I did everything that wasn't meds before finally trying the meds. And even now I'm on a super low dose of Gabapentin and doing hypnosis in the hope I can stop meds eventually. FYI, I have a bit of lymphedema in my arm, too, but that doesn't cause me pain, and I wear fun compression garments (designed by LympheDivas but cheaper on Lymphedema.com) so it looks like I'm all tatted up ;)  My physical rehab doc said there's no reason I should be in pain, so perhaps my brain is feeling pain that is no longer there; he's the one who referred the therapist who does hypnosis. That may be true, but the pain sure feels there to me and it makes me angry which is apparently inhibiting treatment. I don't wish this on anyone, but somehow it makes it easier to know that there are other women out there who get it. Who don't think I'm being selfish when I complain about all of the ridiculous complications because, after all, I should be happy to be upright and breathing. Of course I am, but I also want quality of life as we all do... I'm not a \"why me\" person so I never asked that question. And with breast cancer affecting one in eight women, why not me? I do ask why can't I find some way to feel better and move forward. Often. Thank you all for just being there. It helps.",

      "Content": "Jul 31, 2017 11:14AM - edited Jul 31, 2017 11:46AM by klgnyc Barbara, I feel like I'm living your life. BMX with TE two years ago in March and I hated the expanders. Took all sorts of muscle relaxants and even wore a Butrans patch for months, but those only took the edge off. Everyone told me the implants would be better, but they're not at all. Yes, I had radiation, but the iron bra feeling is completely uniform across both breasts...one poster said it was as if someone had wrapped duct table around her as tight as possible and that's a pretty good description. I liken it to someone squeezing my breasts super hard every minute of every day. I used to wear inexpensive bras without underwires, but as the pain continues I can't even wear those and typically go braless or wear a tank top under shirts. My PS had no ideas and sent me to a physical rehab doc who prescribed  PT (my 4th therapist in 1.5 years), a topical lidocaine/gabapentin ointment, two rounds of botox injections, a nerve block, four weeks of acupuncture, and finally Lyrica. Nothing has worked except the Lyrica, but at 300 mg per day it makes me foggy, off balance and just loopy overall. If I took more, I'd be a mess, and I wound up discontinuing it. My head is more clear, but my chest hurts worse. I've found a surgeon who thinks a pre-pectoral reconstruction in which new implants are placed above the muscle would alleviate much of the pain, but it's a fairly new procedure and he's only done about 30. I've spoke to one of his patients who says he's changed her life, but she didn't have radiation and doesn't have my other surgical risk factors. I have a family member in medicine who thinks surgery should be the last option given my risk factors for a third surgery, especially in a radiated breast that may not heal well, but no doctor has suggested any other sort of new procedure or a medication that won't make me a zombie. Has anyone else had this version of reconstruction, or might you have other suggestions?",

I'm actually not really nervous about the surgery, but I'm surrounded by medical professionals telling me I'm making a mistake given my risk factors.

Mind you, I've also done just about everything else and nothing has helped, so clearly I'm an outlier ;) Needles are pretty small and it's not very painful, especially in the scheme of what we've all been through. Injections were on the chest wall above the impants and then on the sides, past impants, near ribs. Maybe two or so per side, if I'm remembering correctly. Good luck. I really hope this works for you. ",

I want these things OUT and I'm wondering if your pain is similar to mine even without impants. Gosh, so many of us are just grasping at straws, aren't we? If someone had told me this journey would look like this, I definitely would not have done recon. And all the feel good, Susan G. Komen, wear pink for breast cancer stories tell you how you have some surgery, throw in some implants, and go on with your life. Yet all of us are in pain and none of us can put this in our rear-view mirror so it's really hard to go on with our lives. I'd be happy to feel 25% better which is a pretty low bar, and I'm sure you all feel the same...",
