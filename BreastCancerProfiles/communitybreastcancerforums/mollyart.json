She had 2 1/2 years of NED before the mets came back to bones and a tiny spot on her liver. When she and I are lucky enough to spend time together she does not want to discuss the cancer or her treatments, so I respect that. She wants to have fun. She was suppose to come visit this weekend but just texted me....\" at the doctors...blood counts are really low. I'm so tired. Besides that they found cancer on my spine and I have to get an MRI tomorrow night. I might need radiation treatments there\". Can you all tell me what this means? Her docs had told her back in June that she should go on chemo, but gave her the option of trying  a combined hormone treatment for the summer. She choose that over chemo. Obviously that didn't work and there's been progression. What happens next? My sister has been a \"mother hen\" to EVERYONE her entire life. Whenever someone has a problem they call her. She puts everyone ahead of herself. Since her diagnoses 4 years ago she's doubled down on doing things for other people. She has not rested at all...just the opposite. It bums me out that she is SO exhausted from carrying for others...but I know that's the way SHE wanted to spend this time. She is the strong one that everyone leans on.  She has worked so hard to make everyone else feel okay about her situation. I doubt even now she'll put herself first...but I'm hoping. Please tell me what to expect next? Shouldn't she be resting? Having a calm less stressful lifestyle? She just goes and goes and goes....not wanting to disappoint others. I've begged her to slow down...but she dismisses the thought and insists she's fine. Today's text was the first time she admitted how exhausted she is. I'm really worried and want to help.  thank you so much ",

She has always been vague about the treatments she is receiving. My family, Mom and Dad and brother all thought things were going well based on the way she acted. Over the past 4 years, she never sat down...has been busy and doing everything for others. I spent a few days at the beach with her 10 days ago and all seemed fine. We just got a call that she's been hospitalized at Johns Hopkins to get the pain under control. Her husband now admits she has a \"new' tumor\" in abdomen, \"new\" tumor on liver, activity in multiple lymph nodes and a tumor on her lower spine that is pushing on nerves. The blood work shows low white blood counts & platelets. He husband  has asked me to tell my family. Could you all please tell me if there's anything positive I can pass on? Is there any hope for moving on to a new treatment? They are looking into radiation for the spine. She had been on A & A for the past 3 months. I believe now she was told of progression then 3, 6 12 months ago.. 3 months ago refused chemo because she had a wonderful summer planned and went for it. Can she not have chemo now because of the blood count? Does this mean hospice? I need to be strong to help my family cope with this. I need them to understand where we are at. It is just such a shock since she has chosen to deal with this and not tell. We respect that... it's just so hard to have it all hit at once. Thank you for your advice. I've looked on this site and learned so much from you all.  You've gotten me out of many dark moments and given me hope. I just have to be strong for her and my family.

I believe you all that this is a roller coaster and this is just a low spot. She may be able to come home today. I cannot thank you enough for helping my family. We have not wanted to have her time spent with us talking about cancer. When she's with us she sings, laughs, whistles... she use to dance a lot but the SE make her knees hurt. Anyway...she's always been the cheerleader of the family. She's going to feel bad that the cat is out of the bag. I am working with my family to not make HER make us feel better! My 50 year old brother is taking it very hard....said he thought she'd been cured. We had intentionally kept things from him...he is a recovering alcoholic and very fragile.

Kim is 53 and was diagnosed on Dec 4, 2010 with IIb IDC. In order to be part of a clinical trial, she was given a PET scan. It showed a tiny dot on her right hip that everyone thought was a scar from roller blading. They tried to do two bone biopsies (scrape?) and finally had to do a needle aspiration. Well, some cells came back positve for BC, so now she is a stage IV. She had a double mx on Feb 2 and had 7 nodes removed. All seven came back positive. She had 19 rads on the hip and was told it was \"erradicated\".  She is getting her drains out and will begin 35 rads on the right breast area (only breast with BC). She has been taking Tamoxifin.  GIRLS, can you tell me why she isn't getting any CHEMO? Is it because she just had the one met and they \"cured\" it? Wouldn't chemo help? They said something about \"saving\" chemo. Do you all think that sounds right? I don't want to scare her and have her second guess her doctors. She is being treated at Johns Hopkins.

It has helped me so much to meet you  and see how you've dealt with challenges. Here, it is treated more like, oh by the way, I have mets....where as in my world when  I mention IV to any of my friends and they act like.....\"ohhhhh\". You know, like who needs that! Nikola, She was initially IIb based on biopsy. Had had mammo 9 months earlier with ultra sound. Her breast specialist (for the last 15 years) said he thought it was just a shadow (ignored puckering skin!) The doctors at Johns Hopkins seemed shocked that he'd not been more concerned A YEAR AGO..... Post surgery and PET, 7/7 nodes with a bone met... now she's IV. Oh well, can't change the past. She's had dense breasts,cysts biopsies for YEARS. She'd really tried to do everything she could do be pro active. So she's really bummed. I believe the girls here when they write..... \"it will get better\". It has gotten better already from the initial shock...so I have faith in what they say.",
