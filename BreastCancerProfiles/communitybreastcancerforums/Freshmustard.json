So over a week ago I got some painful pains under my left armpit and down the left side of my breast. I have had some discharge (green. When expressed. So thought I better see the doctor. She examined me and noticed I had some thickening in the arm pit and non on the other side. And referred me to the specialist. That was to today. He too felt the thickening. But said he didn't seem to concerned but wanted to refer me for an ultrasound it case it's the start of a disease. The pain has increased over the past week to the point I can't sleep on my left side anymore. And my left breast feels so heavy. But no inflammation or redness I'm stumped. And to be honest a little worried. Has anyone experienced anything like this. (no dimpling or puckering or any other signs.) My maternal grandmother had cancer in both breasts. Which I guess is my reason for worrying. I watched this horrible disease take her away from us. 28 years old. So I'm thinking age is on my side Log in to post a reply",
