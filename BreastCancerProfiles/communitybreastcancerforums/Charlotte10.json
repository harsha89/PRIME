Seems like my typical XL would be the size to order. Any advice? Brands/companies/styles? What for the hand?

Stay calm for now -- I'm saying prayers for you on that already -- and just be methodic. Jot down any  questions you may want to be sure to ask, like \"What percentage of patients do you have to call back like this when there turns out to be no problem?\" (I was told 90 percent of the time there's nothing wrong ultimately.)    It's probably best not to alert work or anyone at this point as to what you are having checked out. You don't want the word to get around since it will likely be nothing to worry about. Here's hoping that's the case, and here's a hug for you! --- Charlotte",

The Huntsville area was hit by six or so tornadoes but the big problem now is that a main electric distribution line from a power plant was destroyed, so they are having to rebuild. Everybody in Huntsville and much of North Alabama has been without power since Wednesday (and few places are open for food or gasoline, and no schools or work, or internet or cable TV). Primitive conditions!  I came South to stay with relatives and regain internet and TV privileges. Hopefully Huntsville will be back in civilization next week.   -- Charlotte",

      "Content": "Feb 8, 2011 04:28AM - edited Feb 8, 2011 04:29AM by Charlotte10    The Mammosite technique doesn't always work out, despite the best efforts of your doctors. My surgeon thought I was a good candidate and that it would save me a lot of driving over seven weeks of traditional radiation. The insertion of the device seemed to go OK, but several hours later blood gushed everywhere and I rushed back to the surgeon's office for help. I was OK and the bleeding stopped quickly, but it meant the end of the Mammosite effort, and the balloon device had to be removed.    My radiation oncologist was not unhappy about that, because while trained and willing to perform Mammosite radiation, from the start he said he preferred me to have traditional radiation over 7 weeks. That would give me the full impact and best chance of no recurrence, he said, and he would want his wife or mother to have the traditional treatment. And in the long run, that's what I did.      Note that the type of radiation chosen seems to change the order of things. I had had a lumpectomy, and no nodes were involved in this stage 1, grade 3.  But instead of going from surgery to Mammosite radiation to chemo, I had to quickly reschedule to go into chemo first, with radiation after that.  ",
