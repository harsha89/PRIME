    "Content": "15yrscounting wrote: We've traveled a bit in the past 15 yrs. My husband usually sets off the metal detectors due to knee surgery and I always care for the luggage, etc going through the screening.  I always wear slip on type shoes, etc. to avoid delays. This was our first full body scan.  I had nothing in my pockets and no metal on my person so was surprise that I was singled out for a full body scan due to my prosthesis.  I opted for a private screening but I was concerned about my personal items.  I was not allowed to touch anything and everything was left on the belt.  My items were not tagged and not easily identified by my husband as in the past I took care of everything.  The screening process took several minutes.  It was not just a pat down but had to wait to be sure the test paper passed as well. I think it's important to spread the word to everyone to be prepared when traveling. In the future I will remove my prosthesis to make the process easier, I don't care to be singled out again.   Log in to post a reply",
