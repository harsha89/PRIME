I get how you feel so well, I have recently developed skin mets on the exact place, so I feel bad when I see myself in the mirror, actually try not to look at myself most of the time, even when bathing. I cannot wear most of my favorite clothes any more. How ironic and sad it is..we have so many tumors in our bodies, suffer from so much pain, live each moment with the bitter awareness of our end to come anytime, yet cannot give up our concerns about our looks, the \"cancer look\".   I pray & hug you..hope the best therapy, whaever that is, is selected for you so that you can enjoy many more days with your lovely family.

I had been prescribed Xanax & Lexapro at dx, but it turned out that I was taking them wrong-though the dose was right. Doc explained that to help the anxiety building up in my system resolve, I needed to have the meds act 24/7. So, instead of increasing the doses (which I thought was the only way to solve the problem), he simply divided them to be taken at specific times of the day. And it WORKED! I do still wake up a couple of times during the night due to the Tamoxifen hotflashes, but can go back to sleep easier than before. And wake up feeling relaxed & rested. I strongly suggest you check this out with your doc.  I do have some tough moments every now & then, but at least get some regular quality sleep every day. Oh and I can say time flies playing scrabble on ipad :) Love & hugs, Ebru",

We can't choose our family members, please bear this mind. You are not stuck with any of them once you have your OWN family. Ideally, it would be best to have good relations with everyone, but not worth fighting for an already lost battle. People can be mean, bad and it's best to avoid them. I'm sure you already know all I've written so far.. Yet sometimes one needs to hear / read in our case from someone else. Would you rather force yourself into a fake relation with the ones who only keep hurting you or spare your most precious time left with the cutest ever grandchild? Stress is not good in our case, we are to just become as SELFISH as we can for the sake of our loved ones. They deserve to spend as much time as we can possibly have. I believe that the people who cause more struggle to the ill only ruin their own karma eventually. And do trust the fairness of the Universe. You don't have to prove anyone anything as long as you are confident with the truth. And my very sensitive & emotional friend, I know you and love you. As many other friends in your life, all of whom you had the luxury to choose. Quite often, friends become closer than many members of the family. Finally, boo to all who made my sweet Chis cry over such bullshit! Huge hugs & love Ebru",

I get you..  Blamed, cursed at, wanted to leave everyone & everything at different points of my life.. Now at 39 (with MBC the past 3 years) I am at peace sort of  with them all. But more importantly with myself. This is MY reality, which I expect none of my loved ones to ever undestand or accept. I am alone in this. So just settled my relation with them cancerfree, love them and cherish their existence. Docs are better in understanding, yet they speak based on proof. Not self experience. I take all medsociety can offer and accept they cannot fill in the blanks left still. BCO literally kept me awake and motivated to learn, share & support (give and take) in so many dark times. So please stay here. Helps so much.  Well shit happens. To some it's more frequent. Since can't change it, leaving things to the flow is best. You get treatment, support, live your daily life best as possible and it ends someday. To us it is a horrifying reality with each breath.. Not easy.  My first response upon dx was \"wish I didnnt have a kid\" we all are different :) that's for sure We make our vows at marriage but so few really mean it in real sense or understand what we are taking on as responsibility. Why all the fuss? Your DH did promise to be by your side no matter what ı am sure. Did the vows included promise of \"giving\" children to him I wonder? If so, you may feel guilt ;)  Hey sister welcome on board. You are not alone. One day at a time. No need to persuade anyone what you want or not want to do. Your life, your decisions. You know what's best for you.  Always the best & hugs Ebru",

I noticed right there & then that with their level of education and med experience, neither of the docs had an idea of the implications of the talk on the patient.

She needs that for peace of mind & in some cases ( mine at least) help the body relax despite the huge war going on in it..  Hope she feels relief soon.. Do ask for help from the med team for proper SE management. Sometimes when you don't speak, they may assume things are OK.  All of this aside, this is stage 4 cancer..

It is a good day to enjoy that part of the news. I remember reading some posts that kept on mentioning chemos not working one after another, which was so depressing. Taxol is good. Working for you. AND second time round.So we are happy about that. You have good many options still in your pocket, which you will need further ahead.  A couple of months ago, while I was on Taxotere & thinking what's next.. already had the Red Devil, Now the T Truck.. my DH reminded me these were helping me out to hunt down the cancer buggers. That I shouldn't feel like they were the enemies themselves. Feeling some of the worst SE's at that moment, I was like \"oh yeah what do you know?\" but thinking about it furher since then, I have somehow bought the idea and now feel calmer, if not friendlier towards the thought of chemo again.  I think your MO sounds too straightforward, not emphasizing with you. You, we, everyone knows these facts, we need to be told the details GENTLER, and one by one.. That's how I feel about it. Since we cannot turn back the clock for you to have the conversation again, why not focusing on the next one and asking some details on how to keep better QOL on treatment.  I am sure you are familiar with some of the chemos SE's, not all pull your hair out. Some are in fact gentler for many sisters than the AI's..which when first reading it, I was fascinated about btw.. Maybe being a part of the treatment plan according to such details we help you out. When I was first told to be put on Zoladex, I asked if there was a gentler alternative, so now I am on Lupron. Silly but I am not afraid of dying itself, but a shot in the belly . Never been NED so far, so I cannot comment on that, but I believe in managable QOL. Maybe MO could offer some stuff to lessen the SE's you are currently having. Already having Tamoxifen out of the list in just 4 months & praying Femara sticks around with me longer than that, I know the day will will come when I am left only a number of chemos to continue treatment. Daily QOL dear, please don't think too far ahead.  Hair is a great issue, for all of us. Wish the price of our treatment wasn't that high. Personally I prefer losing hair to having nausia like harsh SE. Cancer is cancer. Cancer sucks. Not having hair is for me mostly what everyone else around me should deal with. But the harsh nausia etc is totally what I am dealing on my own. But that's me...I am not the once attractive gal I was, with my skin mets, shrunk & brownish left boob, so DH is already fine with my baldness already . Well even if he is not, he has stuck with me for some more time anyway.. I hope! love & hugs, Ebru",

I chose this one cos it's covering more on the front so my skin mets don't show. I have a small boob, the other one's shrunk flat with chemo somehow... Never considered recon from day one, that's me. Learned later I couldn't have anyway. Dh is fine with the remaining one, so far., he said once he was in love with me, not my boobs, which would get uglier with age anyway.. of course there is some imbalance of my looks with the bathing suit on, so right before climbing for the highest slide with ds, I tucked my dh's poolcap as a fake boob before getting out of the pool. Not that I cared, I had nowhere else to put the cap. The slide was fun. Right after we were getting out of the pool, I realised my fake boob was right on my stomach in the bathing suit hahaha 😳😳. Well I pushed it up and walked out of the pool as if it was the most normal thing in the world. Btw sun is totally banned for Xeloda users, who cares, just 2 days with ds who was sooo happy with mommy in the water again with him after 2 years. Worth the price. After a while dh asked for his cap back before getting in the pool... Well I grabbed it out of my bathing suit and handed it over... I had great time. I don't wear bras anymore. Choose appropriate clothing, trust me there are some cool stuff even for us.. But of course that's me. I know many feel recon is crucial to feel better about their bodies & I strongly respect them. But for me, already radiotherapy ruined skin offering nothing but what I am left with, I adopted the Italian / French approach.. Attract attention to my best parts.. I laughed my brains out when announced the most beautiful woman on 20th year highschool reunion, little did they know.. Focusing at my Pink hair & professional \"porcelain makeup\" hiding the severe facial rashes of my Xeloda, they didn't realise the weight I put on, my saggy legs as I can no longer excersice I hid under the long skirt!!! It sucks, no it sucks big time most of the time, even though I try to make fun of it most of the time. Know what, I cry very hard at times too. But then feel better at other times that I am still alive & not alone in this crappy new life. Thankful for each day I still get to spend time with my dh & ds. Will be glad to help you grab some great clothing rather than buying bras! Anytime dear.. And there are sewable breast covers shaped as bras you know, much more convenient. I don't even sew them, just tuck them in if I ever need too. Well my private secrets have all been releaved at last 😏. For you and anyone else interested... Hugs & much love, Ebru",

I was put on Xanax & Lexapro by docs, but it was only after I visited a psychiatrist to have the dosage / using instructions revised properly it worked for me to sleep, indeed. My painkiller Tramadol also helped relax even if not sleep.  * Need oxygen & more oxygen.. the chemicals work on your whole system so your body needs to breathe more. Wearing light clothing and frequent walks (though not far, you can't make it I agree) helps too. * Red stuff, cherries, berries whatever to keep your blood levels up, so that you don't get more effected by the SEs.. maybe haven't already seen my famous watermelon white peel recipe!? I am serious. It has more than the red part offers for us. So eat it up sis.  hugs, Ebru",

Though ER +, hormonals failed me at first, tms skyroketed to almist 3000 at some point.. Now Xeloda has taken things under control..  One day at a time is the formula.. Experience led me to add to that one activity per day. So things are more doable, more quality time with family..  Extensive bone mets need lits of resting, for me, at least. No pushing yourself too far.  Pleural effusion, as your mo said, is not the biggest issue.. Walking, deep breathing exercises, working with an incentive spirometer helps lots!  And tx also help resolve fluid of course.  Don't count the years.. enjoy the moments  :) Hugs Ebru",

Mom's best advice to me as she had a brief ride on this effing roller coaster herself..  People without experience can't and won't get you, so the more talk the worse it feels, sadly.  Extra bucks to a psychiatrist ( not psychologist) is worth it.. Hope you are on your mood meds EVERYDAY, not occasionally, cos they don't work properly otherwise.. A good psychiatrist will adjust your best dosage of them daily, if not already done so. And you can gossip about and curse at anything & anyone while with the psy, they have great responses for specific circumstances, trust me!!! Xanax needs to be taken 12 hours apart as it's effect lasts max 8 hours..the real effect keeps working for just a couple of hours.. So divide your daily dosage in two, if not already know that. My psy said not even some his colleagues know that..  İ was quite devastated to find out Aİs worked just a couple of months ( who am İ kidding?? Never worked, TMs skyrocketed each month!). İ had read on the boards for some Aİs are more tolerable, for others chemo is, at least some of them.. İ was so focussed on being happy to have my hair back on Aİs that İ had overseen my horrible SEs on them..Xeloda shocked me in a good way on my second date with him... Well .. WHAT DOES NOT KİLL YOU WİLL MAKE YOU STRONGER has been the exact case with it.. He liked me more finding out the heart attack (literally) he caused of his awesomeness (a chemo in pill form with no hair loss!) didn't back me down. So Our affair is still on, for now..  We are arming up to support you in your next adventure with chemo, yeah! We know our ways to deal with their SEs, each one of them! Never forget you are NOT (at least virtually) alone in this.  Cherish your family as they are, not them with the c-buggers.. Let your med team and BCO sisters help you with the rest 💪. Hugs & love Ebru Edit: İ made sure my fave quote was not skipped in this long post, today's gift  for you !! ",

Thanks.  I have been following her posts on FB, so just realized it's been like a week since I last saw anything from her..  Dear Jill, You have a special place in my heart.. Sevgili dostum benim . Praying day & night for your comfort and so glad to have met such a friend as you. Feel extra blessed to have been welcomed in your family memories on FB which I so adore.. Hope to hear better news from you soon.. Oh this crap! Where's the cure?? Please drink a spoon of cold pressed virgin oil first thing in the morning followed by a huge glass of water.. And the black cumin ( freshly powdered) çörekotu in Turkish at least a tea spoon a day.. Artichokes more artichokes just have someone boil them for you drink the water, suck the roots of each leaf, eat it.. As much as ypu possibly can.. Maybe these will help with some relief..  I am preparing the biggest surprise next week.. Be sure you check out the boards after next weekend :)  And please do keep posting more of those lovely photos!!!  Hugs love more love & hugs sweetie Ebru",

At least here😤 I was glad to find out a couple of other people do walk around with toilet paper rolls when have their noses drip. Cos we have to make sure the problem doesn't reoccur once we heal the skin. I use Bepanthol for that as I do for everything else ☺. Hope you find relief soon.

Much scientific evidence shows operating on metastatic areas only help the cancerous cell travel faster on the lymphetic highway throughout your body, so cınsidering your past operations, the Med team most probably think it's best to treat well and look after your body, help it keep all energy for the fight, rather than recovering from yet another operation ..

You have to be your own advocate, don't forget that. And you need proper mood management. If the current meds aren't working, please DO consult with a PSYCHIATRIST. They are the only ones who CAN prescribe what you NEED in the right DOSAGE. Now, this crap sucks, and do rant away whenever you can. I do that myself quite often lately. No apologies ever again, please. And never feel guilt for your loved ones struggling along with you, as this is their shit as well as yours, to deal with.

OK we all have c-buggers in us as our common side, but we also have many different stories, some of which we all have experienced sharing with anyone else doesn't help, but with the sisters here. So take all time you need. We are always here to welcome back, as I have been welcomed with most heart- warming comments, after deciding in quite a short while  that I cannot be away from the boards actually.  Take care, hugs, Ebru",

You need good quality of sleep as a part of your treatment & anxiety doesn't help it for sure.  love & hugs, Ebru",

TMs still on the rise a bit.. Well it's autumn already, so hope Xeloda will make peace with the surrounding contitions and kick back in. Since hormonals did not like me before, I want to stick with hair protecting chemo as long as possible .. Dh hates short hair & Ds is still too young to grasp things as they are.. Of course, already started viewing new hair trends in case I ll go for wigs again ;) Great that Xeloda (which gave me my first heart attack right at the start) is my great friend now that I am constantly on heart pills for the past 3 years.. Strongly suggest newbies to read my past threads on its SEs and nutrition advices :)) Well, today I said bye to Tramadol 100 mg, which had been my sole pain killer right from the start. I insisted on not moving on to stronger weapons immediately and confess have endured a 'bit of' pain especially during this past summer.. Keeping activities on low level, etc .. So feel confident my new handsome pain management doc has joined my team at the right time. Today :) we discussed matters in detail and he prescribed a codain based coctail :))) for regular use and another strong weapon for breakthrough pains.. Feel happy.. Feel relaxed.. Finally the pain is under control. I am confident I made the decision to move on to new meds right on time. No more driving. Dh already took away my car, knowing my fast driving instincts o well .. But am still allowed to go to grocery store etc when I must.. Driving has always been my hobby loved my cars and probably that's why I resisted so long not to use much meds till now.. Susan & Sue who have been in Istanbul know that :) the city is much enjoyable with a car.. Well that's the end of another chapter now :) Still on Xanax & Lexapro for mood and anxiety control.. The yummy doc said we'll stick with those for noww.. Gals, please consult with a psychiatrist for mood meds and pain doc for pain control.. MOs can only know as much on those c- buggers .. My cardiologist is still in control of my heart and pulminologist ( also an immunology specialist) closely watching mu PE and the rest.. The headmaster of the team is of course DH, dealing with his crazy wife still. I am so blessed to have him by my side. He is writing a book on history, hope I get to see it published.. DS finally got the notion mommy is really sick.. A great success of the family I believe.. Not to have him worry for mommy for this long! Now he is 10, just started middle school.. Just another accomplishment to have witnessed that as well.. Guess I'll need 24/7 house assistance from now on, so will be hiring a full time maid soon. Not my fave to have a stranger living in the house, but my bone mets disagree with that :)) Life's been good.. Met so many gals during this journey and based on my experiences, what I suggest most is PLEASE IGNORE ANY SORT OF NEGATIVITY in your life.. Especially during the past few months, I was so surprised to experience such horrific pain right after I got sad, angry, overwhelmed .., you name it.. Interesting but true.. Very true. Not easy to deal with everything so possitively I KNOW, yet communicating this with you loved ones DOES help. This has been the greatest discovery of tje past few months living in pain hell.. Btw I am still around, my post may sound a bit like wrapping things up.. NOPE! I want to meet the newbies, that's why I keep on writing.. Hopefully will post more often ..

On the other side, we haven't found out what causes this, yet. But so relieved I can now be with my son again. I love you all so much, you know your support helps me pull myself together and move on. We all have so much crap going on. But then, life is going on, STILL :)))) It means soooo much to have you all by my side, while you keep dealing with your own delicate issues.. I'll check out nerve pain relief meds, as I have been using Contramal during all this, but it didn't really relieve much. One can be amazed how much pain she can endure.. Well, what I have been going through was definitely worse than giving birth. And yes, I should be my own advocate on pain Management. Meanwhile, hot water bags help a bit. Interestingly, numbness of my chin got a bit better during the last few days of my off week from Xeloda. And we were focussed on Zometa all this time. More tests are waiting, including a possible spinal fluid check. But we don't rush for now as there is little time of school break left for my son and he missed me so much.

TMs still on the rise a bit.. Well it's autumn already, so hope Xeloda will make peace with the surrounding contitions and kick back in. Since hormonals did not like me before, I want to stick with hair protecting chemo as long as possible .. Dh hates short hair & Ds is still too young to grasp things as they are.. Of course, already started viewing new hair trends in case I ll go for wigs again ;) Great that Xeloda (which gave me my first heart attack right at the start) is my great friend now that I am constantly on heart pills for the past 3 years.. Strongly suggest newbies to read my past threads on its SEs and nutrition advices :)) Well, today I said bye to Tramadol 100 mg, which had been my sole pain killer right from the start. I insisted on not moving on to stronger weapons immediately and confess have endured a 'bit of' pain especially during this past summer.. Keeping activities on low level, etc .. So feel confident my new handsome pain management doc has joined my team at the right time. Today :) we discussed matters in detail and he prescribed a codain based coctail :))) for regular use and another strong weapon for breakthrough pains.. Feel happy.. Feel relaxed.. Finally the pain is under control. I am confident I made the decision to move on to new meds right on time. No more driving. Dh already took away my car, knowing my fast driving instincts o well .. But am still allowed to go to grocery store etc when I must.. Driving has always been my hobby loved my cars and probably that's why I resisted so long not to use much meds till now.. Susan & Sue who have been in Istanbul know that :) the city is much enjoyable with a car.. Well that's the end of another chapter now :) Still on Xanax & Lexapro for mood and anxiety control.. The yummy doc said we'll stick with those for noww.. Gals, please consult with a psychiatrist for mood meds and pain doc for pain control.. MOs can only know as much on those c- buggers .. My cardiologist is still in control of my heart and pulminologist ( also an immunology specialist) closely watching mu PE and the rest.. The headmaster of the team is of course DH, dealing with his crazy wife still. I am so blessed to have him by my side. He is writing a book on history, hope I get to see it published.. DS finally got the notion mommy is really sick.. A great success of the family I believe.. Not to have him worry for mommy for this long! Now he is 10, just started middle school.. Just another accomplishment to have witnessed that as well.. Guess I'll need 24/7 house assistance from now on, so will be hiring a full time maid soon. Not my fave to have a stranger living in the house, but my bone mets disagree with that :)) Life's been good.. Met so many gals during this journey and based on my experiences, what I suggest most is PLEASE IGNORE ANY SORT OF NEGATIVITY in your life.. Especially during the past few months, I was so surprised to experience such horrific pain right after I got sad, angry, overwhelmed .., you name it.. Interesting but true.. Very true. Not easy to deal with everything so possitively I KNOW, yet communicating this with you loved ones DOES help. This has been the greatest discovery of tje past few months living in pain hell.. Btw I am still around, my post may sound a bit like wrapping things up.. NOPE! I want to meet the newbies, that's why I keep on writing.. Hopefully will post more often .. I know you all miss my photos and all.. Elections are coming up in Turkiye.. Fingers crossed we'll finally get rid of this tall mustache! Codaine is good ;) well life's rewarding me being a good girl all my life.. Now I am a junkie!

I am also on a healthy diet, but aiming to occasionally enjoy some of the \"no no\"s myself as soon as my TM's are lowered to an acceptable level. Eating a cookie or two making you feel happy vs guilty afterwards, is the thing to watch out for. How you feel is more important than what you do. If going to enjoy it, go for it ;) My cousin replaced sugar with honey for my son's (allergic to all unhealthy happy food) cookies, which he loves so much BTW. Just an idea. For exercise, MO advised swimming (when chemo over) for my extensive bone mets, now that summer is over! Now will look for a clean pool.. I am currently just walking. All harsh movements are forbidden in my case, so I suggest you check with onc what is best for your specific case. I take a calcium, magnesium, zinc& vit d3 supplement everyday, subscribed by onc. Having said all this, I admit I am in a similar place as you are right now BTW. Hope we all feel better soon.

I will never forget one of the oncs saying \"don't you want you see your son's 10th birthday?\" when I first rejected therapy based on my experience 20 years ago. I was happily shocked to find out here many of the stage4 sisters outlived their oncs' predictions. Now I have hopes to maybe see my sons high school graduation. Lol",

Lung, Liver & Brain mets are considered more dangerous, as far as I have learned. I was dx'd Hodgkin's Lenfoma when 16, 20 years back, the chemo just sucked in every possible way, and I also had a taste of the nasty radiotherapy given as such high doses back in the day! Of course I made an oath never to accept any therapy ever again if faced with a similar dx later in my life.  BAM, past April I was dx'd with mets to nodes, almost every bone I had, pleura & skin (for now). I immediately rejected therapy at first, sticking firmly with my oath. I felt betrayed, why now? They once told me past 10 years (not 5, right) I would be cancer-free. And it was 20 years!  My oncs spent a lot of time reassuring me chemo is nothing like what I once had, not because of the drugs themselves, but the drug industry has progressed so much dealing with the side effects. Yes, tried & true. Now on Taxoterrible, the cycles pass as a breeze, condisering past experience. I have been informed radiotherapy too is not once it was, although I have no chance receiving any more of it.   So much already said, I am glad to have accepted therapy. I wake up each morning and see my loving-hubby right next to me, and my 7-year-old son jumping in our bed with yet another lego truck he has built! It is surely worth it for me. And the stats ... well the h... with them. They have already been proven wrong. Why not again, for the opposite this time.",

I have been enjoying the daily sunshine, sitting at a coffeshop, meeting with friends.. can do whatever I want when I feel like it.. dx actually liberated me from what I believed my obligations were.. to live my life the way old retired people are supposed to (as I once believed) Spending each sec with your loved ones has no price., Trust me, no job is a hobby..

Your body is at war and need all focus and energy possibly can devote to that.. well that's something money can't buy. On the other hand, some sisters say working distract them and they feel normal- ok.. for me, I have accepted my reality, closed down my business right after dx and live each sec enjoying and ignoring all possible stress.. also have kicked out toxic people out of my life.. my cancerland environment is still managable this way.

I even have them adjusted to each new therapy.. I have an oncology psychiatrist, oncology dietician, pulmonologist, cardiologist and pain doc on my team of docs.

I read all those bad reviews on the internet about it too late & was pissed at DH for a while for ordering it, though was so sweet of him to seek for the ultimate best available here. It is way too pricey, I agree. But it definitely hugs my achy bones gently, I don't bother even eating at the dinner table. I definitely suggest something similar if not this one, I am sure you have more options in the US. And why not both the recliner & the trip you want? I guess we all are past our economizing days.

I guess it would be too much on me to handle their conversation then. During my previous infusion, the lady sitting next to me observed me for a while and (probably not seeing me in enough misery until then) snapped at the nurse adjusting my IV \"she will get the red devil too, right?\" I almost replied that I had enough of my share with it at age 15, but could keep myself from that.",

They feel \"things\" about what they see.. We of course do not share each and every SE of treatment, our experiences with our visits to the \"dark places\" with them mostly, including DHs, trying to protect them from feeling sad. Which, I think is the hardest JOB.. For me at least..  I am blessed with the luxury to send DS for stay overs to grammys as we live in the same city ( even arranged his school bus accordingly for such urgent times) so that he is away when I need to flush my dark thoughts mostly alone..  DH tries to help , wants to share, but after almost 3 years of experience I know it only adds more burden on him and does not make me feel any better.   My first visit to the psychiatrist was to have the mood meds prescribed, wasn't expecting anything more. Turned out speaking a bit worked wonders. I had a couple more visits just to chat after that.  You girls are lucky, wigs in the US are ROCK! I don't know if it's already too late, but I once met a lady in infusion room who cut her hair before treatment & had her wig made with it. Wished I met her before shaving off my waist length natural blonde hair before first Tx... Maybe the idea helps any one of you ladies. Anyway my solution to hair loss was going wig shopping with Ds and had him choose various ones with me. He felt empowered against the embarressment choosing which to wear when, for me :)  Trust me, as long as you are alive and you can hug them & they can have that mommy smell ( how bad you think you smell with the chemo smell that doesn't ever wash off !!!), everything's fine. I greet Ds each day he arrives from school and take my afternoon nap - not before as I fear I might not hear the doorbell ( and don't as I sleep too deeply) - when he prepares his own snack, does his homework & play until Dh arrives and calls in / heats up dinner from the fridge before gently waking me up. He is grateful I am with them still, each new day. The house work is nothing compares to that for him, I know by heart.  I sometimes shop for new clothes and sering me dress up makes both of them so very happy, as I am mostly in my sweats when at home. I decided to do this more than occasionally when Ds arrived one day from school and asked \"what's the occasion, you are dressed up?\" When all I had on was my jeans and a tshirt!!!  Easier said than done we all KNOW, but I will say it anyway  One day at a time! Just cherish each new morning you still can wake upto being with them and ask for all meds available from your med team ( as they might assume you are fine when you don't) for your QOL during this time.  Love & hugs Ebru",

Effexor, on the other hand, interferes with Isoptin, my heart medicine (I am one of the lucky ones to have more than one exciting illness!) on a much higher level, so concluded I stay with Lexapro with the same dose.

Yep, I met all the sweet angels from their posts & met you all on the recent posts. With Kita's passing I thought I couldn't handle any more losses & thought maybe leaving would help. But it didn't. It took me just a couple of weeks, or even days maybe to figure out I was already a member of this family. I thought of each one of you when read & heard something. Couldn't resist sharing anymore, so came back. It's hard for us all sometimes, as Janis pointed out we are here not just to receive, but also to give back. Just in any family, it is sometimes more happy & other times sad. The last couple of news hit us all hard for sure. I believe the silence is why. Hopefully we will be receiving more happy news soon. We can deal with it, together.  love & hugs, Ebru",

So kind of can predict SE's a bit.  Back when I used to do take Femara before bedtime, I had to wait like an hour to GET to sleep, because approximately in that interval the hot flashes started kicking in & I felt lousy for a while. After a change of T-shirt & drinking water, I got to sleep like a baby till morning. But that's me of course. Interestingly, after started taking it at noon, I haven't experienced (yet of course) that strong hotflash, though I have my hot/cold flashes regularly throughout the day. Btw, was told my MO I could take it whenever I wanted at the start.  Lupron is Lupron. Hot flashes regularly throughout the day, but have been much MILDER.  Hope you find the best for yourself.

Religiously, you have not used up all breaths your body was programmed to take in before birth, be it faith, meaning of your existence in any religion or the atheistic approach  Mystically, you have not still known your true self & reached peace with your existence to achieve nirvana, greater self, etc..

I feel you are still in the shock of your dx. It is normal to think think & think of this cancer crap every second of the day & night for a while. Please consider taking meds for anxiety & depression. They are a normal part of your therapy. I was surprised when my MO first suggested them, but found out it HELPS a great deal. You need to sleep. Sleep will help your therapy.  I cannot say having children is meant for everyone. So it won't help regretting your past decision. You could have had a child & be worrying about his/her feelings of your current situation right now. So it's better not to dig that deep & jump to conclusions. Now it is time to focus on yourself, take care of yourself, to do whatever that makes you happy & cherish each moment you still have with your loved ones. You just took a breath & then let it out, right? It's gone forever. You might or might not have the chance to take another one tomorrow, so can't really plan things that far. But taking the next breath right now, you know you still live with it. Focus on that one. Soon that will be gone too, so better not have more regrets than you already have.     warm hugs, Ebru",

Last summer I was so miserable on X full dose, that I quit it totally for two full months on my own decision. TMs were stable at first, got lower! after that and only started to rocket back up at the end of the third month when I put myself back on the lower dose of X again.. Tms were already rising slowly before I quit and continued rising after started back on treatment (MO not informed), but I felt good those 2 months. Mom supported my decision and put me on a strict diet. DH supported me with my decision and helped me as much as he possibly could. The only drawback was I needed full dose of narcotic painkillers as the cancer pain topped without treatment. Rational approach and strict treatment is tiring for sure. It's your body, your decision.. Yet, do remember qol does not get better off drugs.. Tested and seen that! Hugs& love Ebru",

For me, Zometa is good! Also currently on Xeloda as chemo, which has been working miracles on decreasing my TM's. As far as I have learned, none is the replacement of the other, rather they are working as a team.

To flush the toxins out, just drink gallons of water the day before, the day of and the day after each infusion. I recently completed 8-cycle Taxotere & Zometa (similar to Xgeva) treatment. I had great bone pain especially the first two weeks of each cycle. The last week before the new cycle was pain-free. Now I am on Tamoxifen & Zometa & Lucrin. After the first couple of weeks, my bone pain almost completely gone, other than the week of Zometa infusions. So, I figure Xgeva might as well have some blame for the pain. I was prescribed Tramadol by onc on day 1, he said I needed it for QOL. Hope you feel better soon. Ebru",

Who cares.. We climbed mount Eda today! Great oxygen. I tell you, what I wish every now & then is to time travel you all to here right after your dx es.

I was able to donate a cınsiderable amount just in time before school registration last week, which is the happiest event recently.. The coup related stuff has not dissolved yet.. We got adjusted to the new normal :)))) Turkish folks are tough people! We'll see what happens next. Still defending our democratic rights.. Love love listening to Melody Gardot still.

Maybe also try white peel of the watermelon? Both refreshing and boosts the blood white cells especially. For nausia, I currently use kytril.. I had zofran with taxotere before. Kytril is working, maybe try that? For reflux, roasted chicbeans are preferred. You can order it from your local Turkish store. They have regular and white flour covered ones. Whites are better .. They fill the stomach for sure.. If you could only eat artichokes for your liver.. Or maybe suck the roots of the boiled leaves. And Okra for your kidneys.. Best ever..

So spend the day with them and come back at night to my own bed. This morning dad woke me up saying my rooster arrived. He is not a joking person yet I asked him stop kidding. He said a rooster was in their backyard, and their neighbor said I ordered it .. Ugh.. The chemobrain.. We were chatting aboıt 2 months ago when she brought us a couple of organic eggs from their small village. I remembered later today mumbling about how we no longer can eat organic chicken.. I immediately drove over to eat our dinner-to-be rooster  DS played with him all day long till mom cooked it. I figured he can be a surgeon all right.. No attachment and don't kill my pet story here. Still quite hot in September here. I am looking forward to cooler days, this chemical menapause and bloating is not fun at all. Numb chin syndrome continues :( have next blood test and scans in two weeks.. Got so used to aching all over and fatigue that I started questioning why people dive, climb etc.. Most sports seem meaningless right now. We agreed with mom, a stage3 BC survivor(?!) that it's not fun beyond the age 50. Well my body feels 80 at 42 already, so my vote counts!

Even for the lucky ones who can be on hormonal therapy or the ones using chemo in pill form for some time, we all have to be poked at least once every month- 3 months for blood work, scans, therapies. Considering the good number of ladies with recurrences who only can at best ( if not had double mastectomy before) use one arm for all this..And the truth is we all get to taste the variety number of IV chemos someday, if not today. I had followed Lynn's thread which has great info, so please check that out if not already. I've seen / heard people have their ports inserted to various parts of their bodies. One day in the infusion room, the lady sitting next to me zipped down her pants to open her abdomen waiting for the nurse. What was she doing???!! I was an infusion room virgin until then, to admit. 20 years back, I had my first set of treatment in a private room using my arm veins. Well the nurse came and gently accessed her port on the right side of her abdomen, I guess close to her liver. Well that was cool.  Maybe not in the infusion room, but I decided that was better than a port in my chest, if possible. I also liked Ann's (Coolbreeze) idea to have inserted in her arm. BTW I still haven't mine inserted yet. My primary onc is taking her time, I guess, to work out on all possible treatment in pill form before suggesting the port (that's how they prefer in my country). As far as I know there are almost no early stagers with ports here, so it was interesting for me to find out on BCO that early stagers in the US especially do have ports inserted even for 6 cycles of chemo treatment, then have it out.. I can use one arm for everything & it is already tired before my first cancerversary. I would have had my petite power port inserted already if I was in the US, trusting majority of the positive views of ladies with ports on BCO. Hope you decide for the best...   Ebru",

I love & care for each and all of you, who have provided nothing but information, support & love, expecting nothing in return. I tried to share my adventure here so far, hoping to help anyone in anyway & was here as much as I could to offer my support to the ones who were in need at that particular moment. Kita's passing has done it for me. Ironically my message on her blog is the first one implying good-bye to her, whereas I had no info on her final situation. I figured that it is beyond my capability to cope with the loss of any more BCO sisters, so I sadly have decided to leave the boards.  I pray & wish the best of time for each & all of us with our loved ones with great QOL until the day comes for our next adventure ahead. All of you will be in my prayers, even if I will not be here any longer.  Love & eternal hugs, Ebru Dx 4/9/2012, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 1, mets, ER+/PR-, HER2- Chemotherapy 4/11/2012 Xeloda (capecitabine) Hormonal Therapy 8/24/2012 Hormonal Therapy 6/8/2016 Arimidex (anastrozole), Zoladex (goserelin) Chemotherapy 6/8/2016 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Xeloda (capecitabine) Log in to post a reply",

İ am not interested at all of what she meant, İ thought upto now MBC was dangerous enough. Actually relaxed it's only saline for the moment. One step at a time, eh? Meeting MO in a couple of hours..thanx to the onc here, she forecasted my affair with Femara is probably over as of today, which I prefer not believing until confirmed by primary MO. Spam, my TM's were 800s to start with last April. After 6 rounds os TX they backed down slowly until Oct. I had already started Tamox in July or August along with TX. She was already determined to lower TM's as much as possible, had in mind either more chemo or switch to hormonals back then. I was so happy when she announced hormonals.. TM's skyrocketed so high so soon. I think she has lots in her mind right now. I wonder if plans change today, will see soon enough. Colored my hair platinum just this week... Hope to keep it some more time. Will update later.. Hugs & love. Ebru",

I feel Pam has been freed from her suffering and is in a much better place. Having my mother by my side at each chemo session myself and seeing the desperate hope that I will recover fully at the end of the first chemo cycle I am still on, I cannot help but pray To God she does not witness my death. This is the second time she is living cancer treatment with me, the first being when I was just 16. She was so happy when the treatment was over after a year, and that cancer was out of our lives for good back then. So her devastation was also stage 4, as my diagnosis last month.  As a mother of a 7-year-old myself, who cannot even bear properly a high fever he occasionally has, or a small injury he comes from his school with, I am sending all my prayers for you, that you can carry on, despite your pain, which probably the is the worst pain someone can suffer in her / his entire life, ever.  You have already taken very good care of your daughter, but it was God's will that Pam completed her time here and now belongs in heaven.  May she rest in peace. Lots of hugs.. ",

Just started my morning walking this week, hope to keep on with it. Well I am quite active on twitter, Facebook & apps on iPad. NO TV. I hate it. Feel dumbing me. But rent movies on iTunes is fine. :) If not feeling like going to the movies. Not really a reading as much, can't concentrate much on long scripts.. Music is my life.. Keeps my spirits up. Interestingly, I am very happy to my BCO sisters & family for support. But prefer spending more time with people not knowing my situation lately. Guess life somehow goes on hopefully for more time, with the QOL manageable for me. So, why not talk something else?? Somedays I even feel as if I am not sick, of course after popping my narcotics killing the bone pain ;) I am not in need to have many people around me, can self entertain.. hope you do find what you want to do soon. Purpose is to stay alive in a better mood sis. My favourite philosopher summed it long ago with his autobiography title \"Killing Time\". Not just us, everybody else does that. Difference is we are aware of our mortality each second, whereas others think they are immortal\u2026. Well, that's what I think & believe.

That may be why my MO doesn't talk about such terminology.  What I know for sure is that I will be on some form of treatment for life.  hugs Ebru",

I quickly replied him with my limited scientific background, to gasp for breath, to inflate his lungs, etc. He smiled and said \"because he is scared, born to somewhere he never was before\". And added that the fetus happily lived in his mother for 9 months, where it was warm & comfy and he was fed. That, it is the shock and fear of loosing all that makes the babies cry. Only after placed on his mother's breast to smell his comforting mom, he is persuaded he is still with her and it will be fine. He concluded all babies relax and sleep well after the first breastfeed. Having had this experience with my son, I loved this explanation, helped me accept my fears of dying and occasional crying are normal. I am soon (well according to the stats at least) going to die / born to somewhere I never was before. Hope it is the heaven described in my childhood :) It is OK to cry a little until I get used to my new home-to-be.

My iron levels & everything else have always been low, seeing everything spinning occasionally even before dx, so you can imagine the levels of my first couple of months of chemo-induced anemia. Oncs in my country push for nutrition as a crucial part of the treatment, rather than supplements. I have had a strong diet from the start, first visiting a dietician focused on cancer patients to sort out a plan: First the no no's: grapefruit, pomegranate, green tea, anything fried, coke & similar, take away & packaged food of any kind, coffee, salt, sugar, anything with white flour, rice, alcohol, smoking, chocolate meat OK'ed: lamb, sea fish & turkey only. no beef, interestingly. I avoid consuming milk (Onc said may interfere with chemo), replaced it with yoghurt oil: only virgin olive oil   6 meals a day (at least) in moderate portions (not to upset my pleural effusions) 09:00: dried fruit tea, 2 egg whites, 1 egg yolk boiled / omlette, cheese with no salt, whole wheat flour bread, some walnuts 11:30: fruit salad, some almonds  13:00: meatballs/steak of lamb or turkey, salad with all colors, steamed veggies/ veggie soup, bulghur / whole wheat flour pasta 16:00: some plain homemade yoghurt (I add a teaspoon of nigella seeds not interfers with chemo, checked with onc), some nuts  19:00: meatballs/steak of lamb or turkey, salad with all colors, steamed veggies/ veggie soup, bulghur / whole wheat flour pasta 21:30: 2 fruit, some yoghurt It's boring, I know, but it works for me. I have a bite of chololate when I really crave for it, but stick to the diet mostly.    Jan (JCB51), no wonder you are craving for watermelon, the white part just beneath the peel that we normally throw away is in fact what is suggested for cancer patients. Eating / juicing that both really has helped in our blood levels.  During summer I juiced & ate cherries, cornellian cherries, blackberries, black mulberries, strawberries, damsons, grapes, peaches, nectarines, fresh pineapples (the center part especially) in HUGE amounts among everything else, mom kept showing up with a huge glass of something red at least once a day. Consuming all fruit & veggies with peel as much as possible, after washing in apple vinegar & rinsing twice, a boiled beetroot per day, pimentos, carrots, an artichoke per day (when available), celery roots, broccoli & of course lots of tomatoes. Needless to say all is organic. Also have dried fruits occasionally.   And finally grains, beans, chick peas, lentils, cooked with veggies / bulghur, or alone. I drink 2 lt of 8.22 PH water. My TM's were really high close to 1000 at the start, so I have been strict with the diet so far. Planning to avoid some restrictions as TM's get lower. Interestingly I got used to consuming healthy stuff. Always pushed myself to eat no matter how yucky everything tasted after chemo, considered eating as part of my medicine. After the third chemo it got easier.   Ebru  Dx 4/9/2012, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 1, mets, ER+/PR-, HER2- Chemotherapy 4/11/2012 Xeloda (capecitabine) Hormonal Therapy 8/24/2012 Hormonal Therapy 6/8/2016 Arimidex (anastrozole), Zoladex (goserelin) Chemotherapy 6/8/2016 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Xeloda (capecitabine) Log in to post a reply",

Now that I'm on heart meds, we wanted to give it a second chance, since she favors X wholeheartedly. If it works, it will be great, if not we will learn soon enough. Actually I have been considering a port placement very seriously myself, but noone else around me does! Don't know why. I'm on meds for life anyway. I'd welcome the port the minute doc got on the topic, but she hasn't yet.  Ebru",

Him: You say having a great life here is also heaven, but when someone goes to real heaven the family is sad, very sad.. Me: Yes, but they are sad cos they won't be seeing him/her anymore. They are/ should actually be happy, cos heaven is probably a much nicer place than here.. and who goes there is happy.  Him: Yes but D.. (his classmate who lost her father to cancer at the beginning of school year) is still very sad. Me: I never said the sadness goes away. But you keep living. D's father is probably building a new house for his family when they will join them later. Like we built our family with your dad before you were born here. You were in heaven then :) Him: D.. is the strongest girl in class, she has the biggest muscles on her arm and the best basketball player.. Everyone envies her.. She is happy about that.  :) Life will go on for all our loved ones, I trust, as D.. is still the best basketball player.. It will be hard, but they will learn to cope with it, when the day comes for us to say good-bye to them..  About Xeloda.. it is a wonder chemo for many. I hope you will be among them. And some also have very mild SE's. I hope you will be among them! PAİN? I love Tramadol 100 mg.. My best friend so far.. Hope you meet yours soon.  hugs Ebru",

In fact back on Xeloda, which I had to quit the first time round after errr.. it gave me a heart attack on the 3rd day .  OK, rest of the story... thank God I left the hospital not too late after they \"washed\" my blood and went to MO's office where I did wait for hours. People in the waiting room with stage 0-1 conversing desperately did get on my nerves after some point though, 2 full hours of waiting after all..Made sure with the secreatry I'll have more privacy next time, should I wait that long. MO announced Navelbine first. She said it would be in pill form?!. OK this new info & maybe doable I thought, until she said the first dose had to be IV. Without a port & considering my already poor tried veins, I didn't jump very enthusiastically to that idea. Thank you all for your previous feedback btw. Knowledge IS power. She then said \"wish you could do Xeloda\". For the ones maybe who don't know my past experience with X, it gave me a good heart attack on just the 3rd day of the first cycle.. since which I am on heart meds. Small note, it was prescribed wrong back then, for me to take it with empty stomach .. that probably added to the outcome. But of course we never mentioned that to her (as she's already one of the top-notch Oncs in Turkiye), also considering like everyone else docs can make mistakes. DH & I both jumped to that idea, as we believe maybe it would be different this time. She was puzzled by our enthusiasm, which was a brief fun sec for the both of us. With her little knowledge of our real experience with X the first time round, she  could have even thought us nuts to go back on a med that nearly killed me before . Btw not yet quit Femara & Lupron. Will have my Lupron shot on Friday & keep taking Femara for the next 3 weeks. Gives me hope my brief adventure with AI's not yet over maybe. Though MO did admit she was hoping my journey on them would be much longer at this stage & was suprised it was way too short instead.  Anyway, I am a Xeloda girl right now. Will have a look on that one here in detail today. Feel much better for the moment, but it was a big bump for sure the other day. Now I am back up on my feet again! Thank you all for your support & sweet compliments. I'm so lucky to have you all..Will post my new hair once have the final color set in.  love & hugs, Ebru",

MO said raising cows take longer than sheep, it was something about quality of the protein, I did not ask in detail. Kfontaine: Chicken was Ok'ed for me as long as it was hormonefree & free range. Not many producers here are focused on that yet. So prefer turkey meat to be on the safe side. I had read about alkaline water, found a specific brand of natural spring water with ph 8.22.

You either use it one week on one week off of 2 weeks on one week off. MO decides based on your condition. I cannot comment on your insurance issues as I live on the other side of the world. Of course you will seek whatever treatment is available as long as you can tolerate the chemo and have good quality of life. MO's first response sounds so crappy, as you seem to have minor mets. For some TMs are good indicators of your situation, for others not so. So as other gals already suggested, it is best you periodically have scans, just in case. Nutrition is crucial. No dairy with Meat protein while on Xeloda. Make sure you are hydrated well & eat lıs of fresh colorful stuff!!! Always here to support you. Hugs Ebru",

My iron levels & everything else have always been low, seeing everything spinning occasionally even before dx, so you can imagine the levels of my first couple of months of chemo-induced anemia. Oncs in my country push for nutrition as a crucial part of the treatment, rather than supplements. I have had a strong diet from the start, first visiting a dietician focused on cancer patients to sort out a plan: First the no no's: grapefruit, pomegranate, green tea, anything fried, coke & similar, take away & packaged food of any kind, coffee, salt, sugar, anything with white flour, rice, alcohol, smoking, chocolate meat OK'ed: lamb, sea fish & turkey only. no beef, interestingly. I avoid consuming milk (Onc said may interfere with chemo), replaced it with yoghurt oil: only virgin olive oil   6 meals a day (at least) in moderate portions (not to upset my pleural effusions) 09:00: dried fruit tea, 2 egg whites, 1 egg yolk boiled / omlette, cheese with no salt, whole wheat flour bread, some walnuts 11:30: fruit salad, some almonds  13:00: meatballs/steak of lamb or turkey, salad with all colors, steamed veggies/ veggie soup, bulghur / whole wheat flour pasta 16:00: some plain homemade yoghurt (I add a teaspoon of nigella seeds not interfers with chemo, checked with onc), some nuts  19:00: meatballs/steak of lamb or turkey, salad with all colors, steamed veggies/ veggie soup, bulghur / whole wheat flour pasta 21:30: 2 fruit, some yoghurt It's boring, I know, but it works for me. I have a bite of chololate when I really crave for it, but stick to the diet mostly.    Jan (JCB51), no wonder you are craving for watermelon, the white part just beneath the peel that we normally throw away is in fact what is suggested for cancer patients. Eating / juicing that both really has helped in our blood levels.  During summer I juiced & ate cherries, cornellian cherries, blackberries, black mulberries, strawberries, damsons, grapes, peaches, nectarines, fresh pineapples (the center part especially) in HUGE amounts among everything else, mom kept showing up with a huge glass of something red at least once a day. Consuming all fruit & veggies with peel as much as possible, after washing in apple vinegar & rinsing twice, a boiled beetroot per day, pimentos, carrots, an artichoke per day (when available), celery roots, broccoli & of course lots of tomatoes. Needless to say all is organic. Also have dried fruits occasionally.   And finally grains, beans, chick peas, lentils, cooked with veggies / bulghur, or alone. I drink 2 lt of 8.22 PH water. My TM's were really high close to 1000 at the start, so I have been strict with the diet so far. Planning to avoid some restrictions as TM's get lower. Interestingly I got used to consuming healthy stuff. Always pushed myself to eat no matter how yucky everything tasted after chemo, considered eating as part of my medicine. After the third chemo it got easier.   Ebru  Dx 4/9/2012, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 1, mets, ER+/PR-, HER2- Chemotherapy 4/11/2012 Xeloda (capecitabine) Hormonal Therapy 8/24/2012 Hormonal Therapy 6/8/2016 Arimidex (anastrozole), Zoladex (goserelin) Chemotherapy 6/8/2016 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Xeloda (capecitabine) Log in to post a reply",

They all interact in the liver, where Xeloda's main site of work! You should have real protein, young meat , that is lamb, not cow. No deep sea fish allowed. No fries. No packaged food. Deep red, deep green fruit and veggies, prefferably fresh. Have afternoon nap, go to bed early and have shower twice a day. Water's healing power is immense. Cut carbohydrates as much as you can, they equal sugar you know. Drink water, prepare cinnamon and lemon flavored bottles. Don't read and believe anything .. I wasn't supposed to last a week at dx, it's been 5 full years! Not the sick, but the one that's time is due dies. Get stress out out of your life.. easy. I even kicked mom out of my daily life. No drama queen is allıwed anymore around. It's my life. For liver eat tons of artichoke! We get poisoned in the kidneys with chemo & all.. have okra on your plate.. sometimes you cannot eat anything, nausia yep! Light youghurt with crackers help. Also can find roasted chickpeas at Turkish grocery stores to help with the stomach acid. I had HFS on the face dear, and dealt with it.. don't worry, you can manage it! X was good.. wish I could stay longer on it.. no dairy with x! Don't forget! Hugs Ebru ",

I thought they would cut me off it after some time, and even asked once, but nope was the answer I got. I recently completed 8 cycles of Taxotere & now on Tamoxifen & Lupron & Zometa and of course the blood pressure drugs. Still. I know my heart is chemo tired already from my first cancer, docs want to save it from further harm while they can. Maybe have your heart checked just in case? Ebru",

If that was the case, I am sure we would have had a complete cure out of it by now. There are lots of brilliant docs working to find the cure.  People have different approaches, for some it's misdiagnosis, others, miracles, some others God's will & the rest hear stories of a friend of a friend.. I have one story from my doc (and a first person info indeed) that I have already posted here as well, thinking it made me feel good, maybe it would make some of you feel good as well. I respect them all, the variety makes it worthwhile to spend hours on the boards. If I heard exactly how I felt / thought from each & every one of you, it wouln't make sense to visit here anyway. So I tend to pick & stick to every bit of positive input in each post. This helps me keep sane & feel supported & hugged with the virtual love of you all here.  Being a relatively newbie still here, I have come to realize that counting & hoping for years, months, days, hours, seconds is not the point, for me. As long as I have the QOL, living my life \"normally\" as much as possible, it IS OK. Be it a year or 10 really is not the point for me. Arguing in my head  further of \"if's\" just is too tiresome and even more depressing. Having made peace with this thought, I stopped counting time, hoping for miracles.. BUT a cure definitely is welcome anytime ! Ebru EDIT: CA tripled to almost 1200!",

As I have briefly summarised in my own thread a few minutes ago, sun, hot weather do not get along well with TMs.. The rise is NORMAL. Also, flying (which I am banned from now on) also is another critical factor on the TMs, due to the high pressure your entire body endures.. We are never officially told about this but statistics do show cancer patients 'getting physically worse' after intense travelling, especially flying - said MO. Please do not think too much on the matter and rest a bit! Taxotere is harsh, I KNOW! Such a good gun, though. Hope you can possibly stick with it for longer.

Last weekend DS (12) represented Serbia in JUnior Model United Nations, and his resolution on disarmament of countries passed! He was so proud, felt so mature and all.. I am not a politics person, yet feel it is good DS is aware of what's going on and has ideas of what can be done. Since I opened up about my condition last year, he has been quite normal about it, observing my treatment for the last 5 years and that I am still aroumd and with good qol. We talk about death at times, he says it's normal, accepts all will die anyway. I am so grateful he has grown enough to handle things as much as he can. He was just too young when I was dx'ed. ",

Artist, this is day 3 of Taxotruck cycle one and I already feel some buttkicking going on around the areas of my mets. Granna, we already ruled out ascites with the screening. My liver has grown, lymph nodes have grown and I have a bit of PE. Thank God, the suffocating phase is over, after the infusion. Cive, haha :) still hopeful, indeed. Or maybe the Cubans ;) Steph, I agree about Xeloda, SERIOUS c-bugger fighter! Yet, each MO prefer different order of therapy, according to our specific conditions.. Xeloda still is my fave so far :) Linda's MO and mine think parallel. I was to go on to Gemzar&Carboplatin, but my condition reqired Taxotere, the big brother.. once again.. right after Dx I had 8 cycles of it, after which things were under control, stable and could rest on milder chemo and AIs for the past 4,5 years. JFL, no two cents on Afinitor, but DO enjoy your holiday, sis! Keetmom, fingers crossed! Ben's Mom, welcome! Great to hear therapy's working :) DS was just 6 at dx, now he's already a teenager, 12! Hang on, your toddler's got many more years with you. Definitely agree with you on relationship with MO is important. They've seen so much and in time build a theraupatic bond with each one of us, at least mine did. I was open to that and eager for doing what she said. Zarovka, as always you point at specific details to be considered for us all, thank you. Photogirl, happy mom's day to you too!! :))))) Robin, each drop of TM drop counts.. I figured liver mets resist the numbers in my case, yet as MO put it it's functioning is what counts more! Oh well, the steroids had me up so early up again this morning. Guess will try to sleep a bit more. Hugs all Ebru   ",

Finally make a good crunchy ball of the pieces and throw it to the bin.  I gave up educating others for their errors, especially docs. Gosh, if they haven't learned to do their jobs properly in the 10+ years of med education, you can be sure they most probably will not be with our warnings. I had asked my obgyn who suggested I use birthcontrol pills until I got pregnant in my 7th year of marriage, whether my previous Hodgkin's Lenfoma dx & therapy as a teen had to be considered & that using the pills would be safe. He reassured me of the matter.. 20 years later, I found out my current MBC feeds on hormones. Even Dr. Google suggests against them! Wait the story is not over yet. I cannot get rid of him as a person even if he is no longer my obgyn, because he is my DH's cousin's husband!   I figured moving on works the best for me. ",

I believe we all have a full glass of water to start with. With our choices throughout our lives against the things we are faced with, some of us take a small sip every now and then, while others drink theirs all faster. In the end when the glass is empty, it is over for us. That's what I consider our small (but crucial) input to our personal destiny. I think I couldn't have any peace with what I am going through as fair, considering otherwise. That's our difference from plants & animals in the wild. I think only they live & die naturally in full sense. Thinking we drink coke (let aside alchohol), smoke (actively or passively), live in cities with severe pollution or in a small cabin in the forest, exercise or not, take a drug for each time we feel \"sick\" knowing even the most innocent could have serious side effects for the lucky few, we determine the speed of our end upto some point, even though even the ones doing all the right stuff could still be doomed with cancer or any other disease, which is their destiny in the purest sense. My mentor exampled this as people having to sleep more at nights take slower breaths, then ones stay awake later who breathe faster. But as the number of breaths they each have are pre-determined (and of course differs individually) making the choice to go to bed early or not even puts the responsibility of our lives on our personal selves. That's fascinating, for me at least. Makes me feel better than a death-sentenced prisoner waiting for his execution day to come.  Have I told you before I am a philosophical major?

This is the first & last question my MO asks me each time İ visit her.. Later she quickly looks at my cts, blood results & tms, checks my body with the old-fashioned way of using her hands & using her guts based on experience most of the time. She rocks! Btw İ have severe bone, mediestan, pleural mets since dx.. But feel better every day since last year..treatment works, med team help, family & friends look after & sisters here support, all in the best possible way they can.. Just trust them all. Btw, wow you are one lucky girl.. Wish Dragon Girl was around for me when İ was first dx'ed.. She is your virtual mom, no matter what your ages are.. My two cents as a lucky patient of a psychiatrist who knows what he is doing, nit the dosage but how you use the pills matter.. Eg. Popping a xanax right before a flight never works chemically more than an m&m😃. You need to half the daily dosage of it and pop them 12 hours apart for it to work.. This is for Xanax.. Each drug probably has it's own way to lalaland.. Which we have the right to access 24/7. Period. As İ feel Ok (check my posts 😜) most of yhe time, İ asked mo if İ should consider giving up some of the pills. Not even raising her head from the papers she was checking out, she replied \"they are the reason you feel fine. No\". End of discussion. Hgs Ebru",

It was counselling who advised to hold this information from other parents until next year, actually. I can guess why, having witnessed myself an incident about ds' classmate with her own personal problems struggling, and some class parents not having the right attitude toward her. I will definitely try to get to know better the parents to choose whom to trust when needed.",

Lost all hair on body ( except legs of course as I needed them most, ugh)!!!  Anyway, I read some research where Taxotere might cause permanent hair loss.. Well glad that's not the case for you.. My hair was thin and grew back very slowly too. Wearing mohawk style for almost 1,5 years, regularly shaving most of it really helped. Ooops secret revealed :) I AM a rock n roll girl so got the idea easily.. My dh & ds were very supportive. I still don't have the hair I once had but regular shaving, biotin shampoo (just twice a week, let it get oily, your scalp needs it) and eating rainbow colors surely helped a lot. I used no supplements.  Hope you feel more confident with your hair asap with quick improvement.  Almond oil is used generally here as a mask to hair for helping the scalp come to its senses for more hair growth.. Some women put it in their mascara tubes even to grow their eyelashes, so no harm.. Has been used for centuries.. Some insisted it really works on both hair and eyelashes.. Mom (bc survivor?!) once mentioned about mixture of vitamin e tube with pressed garlic mask on the head.. I said no thank you! She did it herself and has male lion hair now, though cannot be sure it was the garlic. Cos she did lots of things. Her pharmacy suggested the garlic formula!  I also figured my head needed to breathe so as soon as I had some hair, I put away all wigs, scarfs & hats.. Some people also insist standing under the rain is a great treat to hair.. Umbrella manufacturers probably hate this idea.  Good luck & hugs Ebru",

So use the cancer caed so that they never will take you for granted and save the last bit of life energy left in you for as long as possible. Trust the experience. I lost a very dear friend to it! Her close circle sucked up her energy and she passed away just on her secınd line of treatment! This is my two cents for you .. Hugs Ebru",

It is quite normal to have a breakdown with a sane mind.. so working on it to blur the facts stabbing your heart does work.. mood meds are for that as everyone else has suggested.. It takes a time to adjust to this phase of your life, no matter who you consult, which med you take, how much support you receive.. we all have been there. For some, it is a couple of months, others a couple of years and rest mmmm never\u2026 well all I can say about this is that I hope & pray you belong to the first group.  In my case, each visit to the oncology department brings both misery & relief.. you can guess the misery part.. I am relieved it's not my son but me dealing with this. Having had childhood cancer before and witnessed mom's hopeless sadness which she couldn't hide in her eyes, I can somehow guess how much harder it can be to live this bullshit (sorry for the language) with your child.  So when I come back home, I try to make the best of it, also already said by many.. Enjoy my time with DS, let all toxic people get out of my life as each sec is precious, not to be wasted for anyone who is not worth it.  Since I have already retired, I have all the time in the world to do whatever I want ( as much as I can afford it) when I am not sleeping. And sometimes doing nothing and enjoying the laziness makes me feel so good.  Hey, what's the worst thing that can happen to a MBC gal? Die? Well without it, we will die someday anyway, so it's really no big deal. The deal is to make the most of it, until that happens :) Easier said than done, but I feel blessed to have been informed beforehand I should make better use of the only life that I have, rather than work my brains out & worry about stupid things & people until I die. :) That's me of course. And I too have nervous breakdowns myself.. which is good, to let it out. We need that as well. After all, that's what tears are for ! I can sincerely say I was't any happier before MBC.. As one gets older, everything becomes a routine.. of course I would love to see my 9-year-old graduate, marry, have kids.. but seeing children who lose their parents early and still move on with their lives, is a relief.. They are much stronger than we think, I guess\u2026 Still I admit I do have fantasies of DS getting married at 13 so that I may see my DIL ha ha ha :)  As my favourite philosopher Feyerabend puts it, we are \"Killing Time\" here anyway.. I hope the next level where we go as angels ( I want purple wings btw) is cooler than here, cos we already got our share of misery.. I believe in the eternal equality of beings in the universe.. So don't really feel jealous why I am not one of those Victoria Secret models.. Or a nobel prize winner novelist.. :) I am sure our time will come.. just wait! and try to focus on the broader picture.. it cannot end like this.. Not logical scientifically, nor religiously (if one is a believer)..  I am chatty tonight..  hugs & love Ebru",

Have you consulted with your Phychiatrist on the dosages? Mine explained these meds, Xanax and alike in particular work in 8-hour intervals, so instead of dose increase he divided the daily dose previously prescribed by another doc into 2, to be taken in 12 hour intervals. Worked wonders. And tell me about the brain zaps & all. All were gone in a short while. My current psy rocks!

That's probably why he has not confessed earlier, but only did when he suspected he was caught. Just like anyone else with addiction to something, say like alcohol usually does. I remembered a Meg Ryan movie portreying an Addict (of alchoholism) & some famous guy I cannot recall now acting as her husband, when I read your post. It was a great example of dealing with addiction as a family. It is beyond just a matter of being cheated on, what you are experiencing, I believe. I say all this, since you asked, but I am confident it really does not matter how long I just go on with facts of rationality..since people are not acting rational many times in their lives. Only you can decide for yourself, whether he is SINCERELY staying with you, or as a consequence of the 20-year-old obligation called marriage. Whether you have that special bond to keep you together until the rest of your life..ask your heart? Big hugs & love Ebru",

Imagine my psychology then. Thank G*d, I am at a much better place now.  The beauty of being here is that we provide each other information, support, friendship, humour, whatever we all need..we have sad days, but then we have better ones following. My mentor said in one of my visits \"just like the day following the night, summer following winter, we have good days and bad days. Living one day at a time is easier just like living the day and not worrying about the night to come. Enjoy the moments as much as you have them\". We will think about what is waiting ahead when that day comes, THEN. It is not so easy doing that, but then we are all lucky to be here to share & support each other. I also say to myself when I feel really good (which, honestly speaking, is not very frequent these days), I do not \"feel\" cancer, and try not bothering myself with the battle going on in my body.

A mom / spouse not motivated to get out of bed doesn't help with your loved ones' feelings at all! They need you to take it as much you do.  Worried about addiction, I asked MO, if it would be hard for me to quit them after a while ( about 1,5 years ago). She replied it would be the least of our problems. Offered the idea to quit them just a few months ago, since I have been feeling well for a while. She snapped in my \" no, they are the reason you feel fine\". Was imformed by my psychiatrist that no matter how great you think you are handling the situation living with mbc, the brain gets very exhausted & the building up of stress works distructively on your system. Why reject the luxury of avoiding that?  Edit: I don't know about any as-needed happy pills, but there's the option of smoking pot for some I heard 😳??!! Hugs, Ebru",

Currently on the chemo which nearly killed me and know what? Not only my TM's have been coming to their senses, but I notice my terrible chest skin mets have been healing. Sorry doc, but this is BCO's success so far. She almost put me on another chemo, where I objected and wanted to retry x,having read so much on it here. Now that I am on heart meds anyway, it's a calculated risk we are taking, saving that other chemo for later. Also know what? My onc wasn't hopeful when saw my situation at the start, now says I'm her best patient.. Docs try their best to help us in either way, based on med records we so depend on outselves fir more hope each second. But even those records don't mean anything after some point. Remember some sisters (bad name memory sorry) passing away all of a sudden when weren't doing that bad????? So for me, I listen to my body now and decide EACH day how to live in it the best that I can. Some days it says take things slow, other days it says don't get out of the bed, hold your pee some more.. But every now and then there are some wonderful days when I even forget I have MBC, rare but I still do. As much as I respect my med team, it is my body who will give me the talk that I will act upon, when the day comes... Hugs Ebru",

They were angry, getting ready for a war.. The priest visited them to pray for their success. He heard one of the men saying how he wish the king listened to them & not go to be murdered. The priest replied \"he wouldn't have been murdered had he stay here yes, but there was no way he wouln't have gone\" I remember this story and feel regrets somehow are objections to our destinies, of course when you do believe in them, which I do.

As much as I feel devasted at times struggling with the reality of my mortality, I still feel lucky to have understood how valuable each second we have in this journey called life. Just before dx, my main problems were work-related, were considering buying a new house, arguing with DH over the silliest things, etc. After dx, I found out I started enjoying life much more, feel happier each day I wake upto, not planning the chores & jumping out of bed to do them immediately. Instead I relax lazily for a while, wait for my son to jump in & play with him for a while. I'm not acting Pollyanna 24/7, but have already figured it's better trying to find tiny bits of things to feel better rather than let yourself caught up in the bad bad thoughts. hugs, Ebru",

I have a brain damaged brother.. i am barely 15 months older than he is and we have always been very close.  (i am the only sibling he'll obey because i am older than he is.)  He was given a small house when my mom died and here is a pic of his mulch.  he politely asks the neighbors is he can rake their leaves in the fall and have them.  the yard is about - I'm not sure = about 35' by 20'.  He uses the mulch but also gives it to volunteer community gardens.. what a nut.  He won't even give me one bucket... \"Mary - the mulch is for the poor!  He is out working, rain or shine, every day.  He'll call occasionally and tell me his is coming out to help me with yard work.  I just adore him because he is sooo truly good.  he goes to Mass once or twice a day, works full time at the post office and does good works for people... paints their house for free.. things like that.    the tomato plants are on the right. I have also taught him many duets.. songs from musicals and kid songs.  here we are playing 'row, row, row your boat'.  you can see how happy I am.. he is such a wonderful trip.  My little sisters must have been teased about him.. They don't like him at all really.  He manage to graduate from college (my dad was a professor and that helped) but went to a very special special=ed school. I have him over for dinner once or twice a week..... if he is not too busy. 3. Can you tell us about one of your childhood memories: When I was a kid there was a nursing home 2 blocks up from our house run by nuns. Starting when I was 7, my mother sent me up every early afternoon in the summers and on Saturdays. (I would swim at 4 pm. with my dad and siblings.  She was very committed to the idea of service to one's fellow men.. When i was first 'hired' I thought I would be playing the piano for the residents. That never happened except for a few times. I helped them to the bathroom, fed them, read to them en masse, kept them warm with little blankets knitted by the altar society. I loved it and made many old friends. It was very very sad when they died. It took me a couple years to get used to the stream of death. I was always shocked when they would actually get sick and die. A few years later I started playing the organ at their funerals. Their sons and daughters loved that.... and I was astounded at the money. The funeral home took care of the 'arrangements'.. They still do. I still occasionally visit a funeral home in my neighborhood. I had a very good friend who went to live there at age 93. She said don't you dare come see me when I am dying. Well, I heard she was dying and quickly drove over to see her, but she has just died moments before. When her daughter came up to Kansas City to put her in the home she said \"Quick - take whatever you want of my possessions so Judy won't get everything. I chose a huge aqua Fiestaware platter which I use all the time  Judy was fine with that. 4. You mentioned playing the organ at funerals. Any specific memory you would like to share with us? Here in Kansas, a brother of a friend of mine, a fireman with a gambling and drinking problem, committed suicide in jail after being picked up for driving under the influence. One of my free lance jobs is playing the organ at funerals. He lived in on the northwestern side of the metro where the houses are pink, grey and crumbled, surrounded by wild dogs, and sometimes have Chief's logos painted full size on the side of the house that has NO windows. Tattoo parlors abut homemade churches of questionable denomination and the roads have no curbs or drainage conduits. William was a bagpiper. After the funeral, which was well attended by sturdy legged firemen whose pants were all too tight, who sported handlebar mustaches and shaved heads and probably had Harley-Davidson wannabees in their detached sheds, 25 firefighters gathered in the vestibule with 8 fully dressed bagpipers.  A fireman said \"We will sound the final alarm for our brother William\" They had brought at least 8 big brass bells (the kind that used to ring in firehouses to call the firefighters and dangle above the front of the trucks). The 8 bells started clanging in a reverberating church of stucco and tile, the bagpipers started playing, and the huge old church bell started peeling. For at least 3 minutes this unbelievably loud cacophony sounded. The congregation was clustered at the back of the church by the firemen and bagpipers. After about a minute of this wonderful noise, everyone broke into the most unfettered sobbing I have ever witnessed. Not a person was spared from the sobs of utter sorrow.  When the clamor died, one of the firefighters, I guess to lighten the mood, said \"Dang it - Bill owed me ten bucks\". The very elderly mother of William opened her purse and gave the firefighter a ten dollar bill which he stuck in his pocket to the dismay of all the other firefighters. Life is very short. 5. You have mentioned more than once your passion for playing & teaching music. Can you share some of your music with us? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsXQAhe8uYY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr_sl_UJdKE  ",

I felt my ribs \"breaking\" with each of those. I bended to hug my knees (I invented it) each time I had to any of those, to feel less pain. No pain meds helped, was already told that as well.

I remember started feeling better by the new year, now feel almost fine. Though I hate yawning still, feeling my ribs streching, ugh!  Take your pain meds anyway, but I suggest antidepressants & antianxiety meds & sleeping meds more, cos in my case at least, the more relaxed I felt, I felt it less.

I am serious. I know many pass away in their beds, surrounded by loved ones, yet my hope is something more like having coffee with DH somewhere, when I suddenly (yet calmly-working on that, still trying to prepare myself to it) drop dead. I had the driving car during the attack fantasy for some time, but now that I no longer drive long-distance, Dying on the way to groceystore is not an ascar-winning scene. Anyway, I dread tubes in my body, machines beeping and the hospital smell. But if be it, I'll prefer the most expensive private one for my last breath. I admit I am scared of dying, but lately am curious of what's next as I witness most of my dear friends here having gone before me. There are only a few of my long-term BCO sisters left still alive, so it is somehow becoming easier to accept it coming for me at some point. Ironic. We seek hope mostly on the boards, don't we? I no longer do that. Have read so much, witnessed so much, that now am at another level now, still occasionaly sharing info & experiences with newbies. It's like a child growing to be adult, the longer we stay alive, the more we grow into perception of death. If I didn't have MBC, I'd be running around for my business meetings, planning our next summer holiday and insisting on moving to a much bigger house with 25-year mortgage, I know. I am grateful for all that I have had so far, I am a luck lady for sure. From now on each breath is a bonus point. Well, guess this sums up my view.. love Ebru",

He was unfair to my performance and I lived professional hell, going through serious office mobbing for almost 2 years after which I quit .. yet, when I heard he suddenly passed away in a home accident ( was young), I went to the funeral, stopd by him and told him, I forgave him. Prayed for him. About a week later, I saw a dream him smiling at me and he thanked. This has been the ultimate example for me to believe the soul doesn't die.. at least no harm in believing so. I have also been trying to be even more kinder to everyone, cos you know, we do break hearts without noticing.. I don't have many people left surrounding me after having retired, so enjoy the silence, cherish the quality time I have with the few who really care for me. I thank God quite a lot each day for having had the chance to realise how lucky I have been so far with tolerable treatment so far and really not plan the next day any more.. go with the flow.. this past week, I have felt like sharing more on the boards, so I do..

But I wanted to share my experience, especially my last experience .. Having failed on AIs on the first round after the first kick of chemo right after dx, I'be been on Xeloda as you see on each of my posts.. The last couple of months had been rough, TMs skyrocked, yet my MO waited. She insisted it worked so well at the start and so quickly, maybe it was my ER+ had to be reconsidered.. So I am back on medical menapuse.. Just after the second shot, I am stable :) and still on Xeloda. I admit, it was no fun the last few months but trusting my MO paid off.. Now crossing fingers for more stable ahead.. I am glad she works not only with her protocol knowledge, but also instincts.. If a chemo / AI does not work the first time round, please do not just dump it and work around it. A reminder for the ones who may not know, Xeloda triggered my heart attack the first time I used it, but now on heart pills, everything is fine. Lupron was first used to put me in menapouse and it was used every 3 months.. The hot flashes were so severe. Now on monthly Zoladex, it's much better.. Hope to give hope to some, who may be worrying about their current therapies.. Lastly, my morphine requiring pain subsided! :) I use painkillers much less and am back onmy feet :))))) There are bad days, yes.. But then definitely better ones. I thank BCO & my sisters here who are by my side.

As you stated the experiences of your parents differed. .. Yours will be a totally different experience. And of course ours as well.. Death is a natural part of every creature's being. We never questioned how we were born or did we ? We have absolutely no idea how it all started, to be frank. I am talking beyond any belief system btw.. A plant, an animal, a human baby.. How does that happen?? Indeed I thought a lot about the topic, being a philosophy graduate.. And concluded it's only fantastic to experience it yourself. Like the first time you ride the bicycle without anyone else's help. Just yesterday, we watched a Nat Geo documentary on how brain digests all the info it receives via senses and how it really concludes stuff not exactly they are. Wow I thought! So death maybe is the step to the reality.. Anyway, mental preparation comes first I believe. When you are mentally ready, your loved ones wil be as well. I have been telling my son I came gere before him to prepare our house, his toys etc.. So he got the idea it is only realistic and natural I leave our home before him to build the next one. I am glad for the accomplishment as he is just 11. Hope you find your answers soon, Hugs Ebru ",

Before that I felt so miserable and alone. Thanks to my BCO sisters, I could learn to cope with the situation, so I strongly suggest you look at the past threads on the matter, if not already done so. My 7 year old son is counting the days of my current chemo cycles and waiting for my hair to grow back. That is his current understanding of the disease. Now that I have some baby hair back, he wants me to take off my scarf when going out. I too have tried to be as open with him like Karen, who was among the helpful sisters on my first communication with my son, thanks Karen by the way. Now I try to cherish each day I get to spend with him, trying not to think far ahead. I guess things will work out somehow when the time times. We all have our loved ones to help us at each step of this crazy adventure, and our board sisters to support & advice on our daily issues. Love & hugs Ebru",

Glad the palliative doc is coming today.. Hopefully you will find relief asap!!! Please everyone, not just you Karen, ask for help from anyone & everyone at the hospital. Each doc his/her own specialty.. Some are brave enough to admit one doc cannot know everthing going on in the body.. During my stay at hospital with severe pleural effusions, MO simply referred me to the pulmunologist for draining & talc procedure.. Well my doc cousin's pulmonologist friend jumped in right in time to say wait for a few weeks & see if chemo & breathing exercises (!!!!!!) would help a bit before further procedures.. Glad İ listened to her. Right on the 5th day of using Xeloda accompanied by Taxotere infusions, İ had an heart attack. Turned out, İ had to have consulted with a cardiologist BEFORE any  treatment whatsoever, ugh!! Glad İ am alive still to share my experience. Now under control of daily heart protecting pills,  İ am still on X.  Oh and (sorry this is long, but İ find it crucial to share as a live example) İ was prescribed mood meds by the neurologist at hand when İ said İ was desperate for sleep & relief were not the right dosages for me & İ was using them wrong cos they didn't work! Well, visiting a psychiatrist, not only the dosages of my Lexapro & Xanax were decreased (no mispelling) İ learned to use them properly and a few sessions helped wonders.. Btw on all my medical records the classification is palliative already.. As there is no definite cure anyway, they bundled up treatment and palliative here ha ha :)) practical.. Like simplifying the organisation charts in companies.. Less protocol!! Hugs Ebru",

X nausiated me the first round, but we started again, but fully equipped this time.  My RO(!) who treated me 20 years back, suggested İ use stomach protection regularly(see my point consult with Them all). İ have separate morning & night pills people with stomach ulcers use and a syrup İ have both morning & night. No nausia this time... And no stomach pain. But beware you cannot use antacids with X. Docs should know the kinds you can use.. All of us using some form of pill treatment (even if just mood meds) should be on stomach protection İN ADDİTİON to possible nausia treatment if that SE occurs.. Ugh ... Things we learn through experience.  Carbs & Protein are more doable with X at times though we are told to juice, eat greens & reds blah blah.. The thing is to keep your stomach full somehow. Wasa crackers with plain yoghurt helps best when İ do feel nausiated. And the extra stomach acid is best sucked by (Barb you know this one!!!) roasted chickpeas.. They are sold ready packaged in any Turkish grocery store (maybe try online if not a near one available). Keep them in your bag/pocket and pop one or two regularly during the day.. Not finished.. The empty stomach's (naturally with that much vomitting) recovery is quite fast with juicing raw potatoes.. Seriously.. My DH's & my stomach ulcers caused by too much medication are mostly recovered with it. As the raw starch covers the inner walls of the stomach instantly, the terrible crawling feeling on the floor in pain decreases, please do try it. Not tasting bad either. The thing is you should drink it as soon as you juice it.. İf wait for a few minutes, the stach will cover a wall in the glass instead ;) which proves it's effect on your stomach.. Also helps balancing the possible diahhrea in some cases..  You probably know no dairy product with meat protein.. No cheeseburger! No yoghurt with steak.. Should consume dairy products as snacks, alone. Oh and definitely no milk!!! Never!!! Hope you feel relief soon with palliative care, thinking of you dear. Hugs, Ebru",

She was open & honest that she may skip some details even if written right in front of her, so I'd better remind her.. she rocks!  You said the doc is more concerned about QOL, maybe he got you wrong on how aggressive a treatment you are looking for..  Also TMs DO work for some.. trying to find out whether you are one of the few lucky ones may be a better idea than just skipping it.

Some keep them in olive oil a bit and consume ( for it to last longer).. İ choose to consume it when İ find it fresh.. This is not an alternative medicine, it's a fruit And freshly powdered black cumin (also can be found in Turkish Grocery stores) a teaspoon of it with youghurt or honey daily helps boost energy :))) İ'll be back with whatever else my poor chemobrain can remember :))  Hugs Ebru Edit: forgot to mention all suggestions are MO approved or else İ'd never have used them myself..

I was infused on Fridays after school, the weekend sucked totally, but on Monday I was on my feet to school, back to NORMAL! 20 years later, was glad I was going to receieve Taxotere (very similar to Taxol as far as I read on the boards) when Onc announced no nausia. Yes I did not have nausia, with proper antinausia meds like Zofran & all, but never felt normal once throughout the 6 month treatment. So glad it is over for now. Red Devil, for me, was way better than the Taxotere Truck for sure. ",
