Before the chemo she had a lumpectomy. the incision has been okay, but today she woke up and the incision is red, inflamed, painful, and swollen. Because she is undergoing chemotherapy, i feel like she should go to the hospital right away. am i overreacting? or should she wait until the weekends over.
