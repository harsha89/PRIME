When I went for my pre-chemo appointment, the nurse practitioner was taking notes on what I was telling her about OTC's for SE's that I have heard about here; like the Claritin. It makes sense to me that the people who have actually been through it know best what has worked for them. As a medical provider myself, I also know that we do not know everything! Just because something hasn't been through a clinical trial or research study and made the journals yet doesn't mean it doesn't work! I do, however, tell my team about everything I plan to do and ask if there is any detriment to using it that they are aware of. If the answer is no, I figure....what can it hurt? I have a real mixed bag of tricks lined up, using both conventional medicine; surgery, chemo, hormonal therapy....and alternative therapies; reiki, medical massage, acupuncture, nutritional supplements, cold cap therapy, etc etc.Whatever is safe to the best of our knowledge, reduces side effects, and helps me cope is fair game! To be honest, I am absolutely terrified and I just want to throw the whole kitchen sink at the problem until I see what I need and what helps. It is just amazing how all of this becomes \"normal\" vocabulary in a couple of months time............ ",

Definitely feel queasy with little appetite, but no volcanos, thank God. Took Claritin before the Neulasta, only very mild achiness. Hoping everyone else is hanging in there, and feeling better soon. Really, the worst of this for me has been the steroid. Aside from the reaction during chemo, the oral steroid the day before and after makes me short of breath, racing heart, pulse doubled, and can feel heart \"flopping\" in my chest. Tireder than I've ever been, but too hopped up on the steriods to sleep much at all from Wed. till today....finally took 2 1/2 hr nap this afternoon and feel like a new woman. Think the MO and I are going to have to discuss alternatives to this particular medication. Yech!!!! My port is a little tender after being used, but nothing major. I really don't think they are all that easy to dislodge. Use common sense with activity, if it hurts, don't do it, otherwise I think you're good to go after a day or two.  I am hoping the cold cap therapy saves my hair, but got my wig today to be prepared in case. Planning a buzz party too, if I need it. I am actually very pleased with the wig; the cut and color is very similar to my own, and my husband says it's actually \"sexier\" than my real hair! Not too sure I wanted to dig into that comment too deeply! Markat, big head, big brain, smart woman; that's how I see it! Laura, Check out American Cancer Society TLC catalog, I got some attachable bangs there that look pretty good. You can return anything you don't like if unopened. Got my breast prosthesis yesterday too, and feel more \"balanced\" than the little pillow puff thing I've been stuffing in there.Want to reconstruct eventually, but one step at a time. Keny, sooo glad to hear of reassuring test results. Yes, I think that is one of the hard things about all of this. Every ache or pain makes you wonder, and I think to some degree we will always be fearful of recurrence. Hopefully it is something we will learn to handle without being consumed by it as time goes on.  I also feel for those of you with small children. The holidays have to be a particularly hard time to be dealing with all of this, and trying to make things as normal as possible for them. I also have two daughters, 25 and 20. The 20 yr old is also away at school, will be home for break next week. The 25 yr old is local, has two preschoolers, and helps as she can, but sometimes the peace and quiet outweighs the assistance, if you know what I mean. I love my grandsons, and feel guilty about needing only small doses of their love right now; but like everyone has said, we as moms and women are givers, and for once we are just going to have to learn to see to our own needs first for awhile. This Christmas will definitely be low key for us, and thankfully mine are old enough to be told that. ",

Went out to lunch, did some Christmas shopping, and start back to work tomorrow. If you'd told me 2 days ago that was even possible, I might have become violent! Call your onc, and keep calling, till you get something that gets it under control.

Interesting how so many of us are in the same age group. I'm 48.I also found the Herceptin only infusion to be no big deal. So 5 more \"bad ones\" and counting. Laura, my MO has me doing steriods the day before and day after, and of course during infusion.  No hair loss yet. Only day 8. Too soon to tell if cold caps are gonna help. Still some of the diarrhea, get tired easily, and have a drippy nose. Took the Claritin, didn't get the bone or nerve pain. I am taking some supplements that are supposed to help with that. For those who have had the nausea baaaad....I just found out that you can take Emend by mouth a couple of days prior to chemo to try and prevent this. MMMHMMM!!!! Guess what I will be discussing with my MO prior to next treatment?!? If we could just get that to be more tolerable, I think I could handle the rest of it. Went back to work today....yaaaaaaaay! Felt so good to know something. This cancer world is so new and scary. Being in a world where I know how to operate was a mental boost.",

We can do this together in spirit on the 1st. I hate the whole thing for all of us too. I am gradually coming to terms with the fact that a future occurence is quite likely. That was not my perspective at the beginning, I was going to have surgery, get whatever treatment I needed, reconstruct and move on. Yeah. Know better now. My tumor is HER+, and I will be receiving Herceptin, which they tell me is a \"game changer\" in treatment therapies for this type. All the survival/reoccurence stats about people with my diagnosis do not really take into account the apparently better outcomes with Herceptin because it just hasn't been around long enough. That is hopeful, but bottom line, we just don't ever know, do we? And not knowing is one of the hard parts.  rachelvk- Hadn't heard about olive oil before. That is probably worth a try and doesn't sound too awful. Heart healthy, also!!!!  I think we're entitled to a certain amount of grumpy. I've sure had my moments. Is Taxotere supposed to cause less neuropathy than Taxol? I did not know that. Hope so, because I am getting THC with Taxotere/Herceptin/Carboplatin. I am 48 with grown children and three grandchildren, so in a different place in my life. I think though that it is important not to close any doors if you think you could have regrets later. There is not a thing wrong with a conscious decision to be child free; on the other hand, the choice to become a parent is something you should not pass up for any circumstance or any person if you feel it is something you desire. I also decided I could not afford the name brand Penguin Caps, but am looking into Elastocaps, which are much cheaper. I have talked to women on the boards who have also used these with positive results. They are more like $80-90 each. It is recommended to have 3-4 of them, but that's still much more affordable, and I'm thinking that for me, it's probably worth a try.  tammie- My surgeon assures me I will be happy with the port, and I certainly am all about avoiding the digging for a vein I experienced during the mx hospitalization. I just hope it is not a constant source of discomfort like the drains! My BRCA was negative, despite a strong family history. I was told only about 5% of them come back positive, which surprised me.  What are you all thinking about dealing with holidays and chemo? I am just sort of choosing to opt out of most things and have informed the grown children not to expect expensive gift giving. Something small for the kids, a collaborative effort family dinner...THE END! Anyone else thinking that far? Also, anyone else planning to/has worked during chemo? I really need to financially. Any helpful tips or ideas for planning?",

I hope that does not turn out to be true for you. Why did they make this treatment choice? Is is because of a particular tumor characteristic or because you have had taxotere previously?  We have a very large extended family and actually have company from out of state this weekend because there is a family baby shower occurring tonight. No one has expected me to do anything \"extra\" and my DH has done all of the cleaning and cooking, but I am exhausted just having them all here. Rotten time of year to have to deal with this, but then, when would be good? It must be very hard to go through this with little ones. Mine are at least grown.  Work, well, we will just have to see. I am a nurse midwife and have very long days in the office and 24 hr call shifts for deliveries. My practice partners have been MORE than supportive and accomodating, and have in fact donated some time, but I simply cannot afford not to work throughout chemo, and if I am going to work at all, am going to have to do a 40+ hr week. My scheduled days can be manipulated to work around whatever are my \"worst\" days after treatments, if we can try to predict a pattern, but once I'm on, I'm on and whatever happens, happens. Very concerned about this. It is great that you may be able to work partially from home if needed. greetings, kennylynne. sorry that you are facing both chemo AND rads. hoping it goes well for you. ",

Less than a week away sounds like it is really happening. I also wish I had words of wisdom about talking with your mom. I understand why you have wanted to protect her from this information, but I hope there are others in your life that you can and do lean on. We all need that. I told my mom right away, that was probably the hardest conversation I had. I started to wait till I knew more, but decided that if it was my daughter, I would be hurt that she didn't tell me. Her mother died from breast cancer and I knew it would be hard for her to hear. Like Rachel's family, she is a nurse and I am a nurse midwife, so we kind of think we should be able to somehow fix this, but it doesn't work that way.  I think your mom will need to hear that you waited to tell her because you knew how hard it would be for her, not because you didn't love/trust/want her support. You and I understand that, but it's a mom thing....you feel like you should always be all that your children need, even if that's impossible. If you are comfortable with it, maybe it would help her to be involved or accompany you to treatments or appointments so that she feels she knows what is happening and is \"helping\" in any ways that she can. Then her need to be your mom is being fulfilled. I don't know if you have children, but I am trying to think about this as a mom, instead of as the person with the cancer diagnosis. Good luck...I'm sure this will be tough for both of you.  Look forward to comparing notes next week.....!",

That is a difficult part of all this, for sure. Do your research, then talk with the oncologist before you decide anything. We each have to find what feels best and go with your gut. Tammie-sorry you are feeling crummy. I was told I get the Neulasta automatically. I wonder why some do it that way and some do not. I hope that when you have it, you do feel better soon.  Rachel-my port didn't hurt at all the day of surgery, but then got really sore for a few days after. I had it done 1 week ago. There is kind of a heavy, or mild stinging sensation there now...in other words, I know it's there, but not terribly bothersome. My 3 yr old grandson was climbing on me this evening and it really didn't hurt. It does get better and will hopefully save us future angst! I know several of us start tomorrow.

They just knock me out so (living in medicinal state!), that I didn't want them if I didn't need them...but wow. Had both Phenergan and Compazine. Compazine seemed like it worked better. Did SeaBands, acupuncture, ginger, yep, the whole spiel. Didn't seem like any of it helped a whole lot. Gator, hope the bowel problems are resolving. That has to be miserable also! I had a little of that, but not much.I did buy some Gummi fiber vitamins, hoping to avoid that. Don't know if that was what helped or not.  I am just so concerned about the cumulative effect. Round 1 was more than I expected, for sure. And thinking of trying to work in between, which I have to do, just makes me want to cry.Just have to focus on one at a time, is all I know. ",

Others who have done this before keep telling me it will be better after the first time. I sure hope so. The hair loss bothers me too. We are already dealing with changed bodies. To have something that is so visible to everyone else feels like being a walking \"I have cancer\" billboard. I have ordered the Elastogel caps and plan to try these. Whether it not it works, who knows, but I felt it was worth a try. Stephanie 33-That makes sense. I just am still not sure how they make all of these decisions between similar meds. Hoping that the SE's are not as bothersome as you fear.  Tammie-will be thinking of you on Friday. Let us know how it goes. I know that you are sedated but awake for this. Would have thought they would put you under general anesthesia for bone biopsy. Guess not. Ask for really good drugs!!! Hope that you are groggy enough not to feel or remember much. My port placement was supposed to be tomorrow.  Got cancelled because my pelvic sonogram showed no change in an ovarian mass (cyst?) of 4 cm from 6 wks. ago till now. My GYN says if malignant, it should have grown; if benign, it should be getting smaller. Since it's the same, they want to biopsy this. To get it done in the same surgery requires rescheduling. Makes sense, but frustrating. On a good note, the liver question is settled and seems to be ok.  Hugs to all. The waiting and not knowing what to expect at each stage of the process is the toughest. ",

We will all be there with you very shortly. Gator, how's your DH? Mine is eating verrry carefully and feeling better for the moment. Have to call the surgeon on Monday to make an appointment for him; they were closed yesterday.Also going to see his family doctor on Monday to try and get his BP under better control before he strokes out on me!  Sounds like we all have the same fears. I hate to throw up also. Have had trouble with motion sickness, terrible \"all-day\" sickness with pregnancies, and also after any anesthesia. Seems reasonable to expect that this is a side effect I'm likely to have.....:) My onc center uses Aloxi as the pre-med for this, I have been reading that Emend is better. The pharmacist at the center said not to say she said so, but if I ask for Emend, I will probably get it. Once again, ya gotta speak up for yourself....why is that anyway???? Have also bought OTC SeaBands to wear and going to have weekly acupuncture treatments which my insurance actually pays 80% of. Who knew? No one told me that either; I researched it for myself. Had the first one this morning, and it didn't hurt at all....actually kind of relaxing and pleasant. I will say it helped with the soreness from the port placement. The acupuncturist also asked me if I have been eating well. (No!) I have gained about 10 lbs. since diagnosis just from less activity and stress eating. He said, well, we will try to relieve some of those junk food cravings also. Hmmm. I thought, \"this I gotta see.\" Don't know if it's all power of suggestion or what...but had lunch at Subway, and no munching all afternoon. Interesting stuff! I guess we'll see how much it helps with the nausea once we get there. ",

I am so non-techhy, and my adult kids are very impressed:) Also think we are possibly beginning to get a handle on the SE's. Called the answering service last night and said, look, I didn't expect to feel good, but constant dry heaves almost a week out is not gonna cut it. They called in a Rx. for Zofran, told me to take that instead of the Compazine I had first. By this afternoon, no change, called back. Now taking Zofran every 8 hrs with Compazine every 4 in between and it is tolerable. I am now feeling \"good\" enough to be annoyed with the diarrhea and heartburn, and taste changes and all the other stuff I didn't care about before, so I think that's improvement.  I think you just have to keep letting them know if things are unbearable...hopefully we will find a way that every experience is not this bad. I expect to feel more fatigue, etc as things go on, but I don't think it's even possible to be more nauseated. I was also told that taking the meds AHEAD of time is important, as it's harder to control once it has gotten crazy. I am always hypersensitive to any medication that I take, so it kind of makes sense that this would happen. Going back tomorrow for just Herceptin....hopefully that will not be as rough to handle. Glad for those that have one treatment behind us, and wishing peace and comfort to those just beginning. I know I read everyone else's experiences before I started and got scared when I saw that someone was having a really bad time, but not everyone gets every SE, and you just don't know till you do it how you personally will react.",

Hadn't heard of them myself before getting on these boards. The 2 main kinds are Penguin cold caps and Elastogel caps. The consensus seems to be that the Penguins are better, but the Elastogel are waaay cheaper. Plan to try them. Don't know how well it works, seems to be mixed experiences and opinions among both users and MO's.Just a thought if you are interested, there is a whole forum thread about hair and cold caps.  Tammie, I have a shopping list too. I really hope that your port placement is not bad for you. Will be thinking of you tomorrow. Still trying to get mine rescheduled and coordinated with the GYN surgeon to do both that and the ovarian biopsy at the same time.  Grace-Sounds like you had a TRAM or DIEP procedure. I am just a little envious; my plastic surgeon recommended not doing immediate reconstruction since there was so much initial confusion about my diagnosis. (which did actually change after surgery). I hate looking in the mirror right now. I hear that there is quite a recovery from the type of surgery you have had. Best wishes as you go through this time and prepare for chemo. I am starting on the 1st also, so we can compare notes in a couple of weeks:)",

We may be physically miserable, but that fear of the unknown is pretty rotten also.  Welcome to those just joining in. Glad to have you here, but sorry you have to be....you know what I mean:)  3girls, I am so sorry that things got held up due to miscommunication. That is so frustrating and has happened to me more than once already. I am quickly getting over the need to be a model patient, and I get on the phone and make noise alot more quickly now if I don't hear from people when I should. It is especially disappointing when you are also a medical professional (I'm an advanced practice nurse), and start to see the faults in the system firsthand. Kind of makes you aggravated with your own profession, which is not a good feeling. You get to a point where you don't care what anyone thinks, you just have to be your own advocate, and everyone else can just deal with it! Gator; keeping you and the hubby in my thoughts and prayers. One at a time is enough, thank you very much! My hubby also sees his surgeon (same as mine) about the gallbladder issues on the 9th. He is insistent that he is not having surgery till the 6 \"bad rounds\" of chemo are done. I don't think that's gonna work out well, but he is stubborn.  Any of you have words of wisdom about helping your families? We were cuddling in bed this morning and my husband just broke down sobbing and said how afraid he is of losing me, and how he just doesn't know how to cope with watching me be miserable through chemo and feeling helpless to help me. It's the man thing of feeling he should protect me....but he can't. I feel very loved, but it just broke my heart to watch him. He's been all tough and strong for me, but he is hurting too. Suggested counseling....yeah, I didn't think so. Any thoughts or similar experiences? Deep sigh....:(",

Keny, I am also a \"control freak\" who ticked off my surgeon just a bit by reading my own chart before she got to the room. She got over it, and figured out it's how I roll. I just couldn't wait one more minute to know what my test results said. Hey, they're yours, right??? Hoping for positive results on pending tests for for Kelloggs and Rachel. Gina, my vote is leave it uncovered. Any open area heals better with air.  Tammie, hoping you are starting to feel better, and hoping for Rachel, Susan, and Markat, that the ports are becoming less bothersome. Rachel; hoping too that you'll be able to make beautiful music soon. Keeping the recreational things that bring us beauty and joy are very important. I have a midwife colleague who had chemo last year. She is a harp player who was worried also, but was able to play after a short time.  Evy, I read from one of the other threads (forgot which one) about nutritional supplements to prevent neuropathy. I am taking 100 mg of Vit B6 , 30 mg of L-Glutamine, and 500 mg of L-Acetyl Carnatine daily. Got them all at the natural foods store. Don't know yet obviously if it works, but doing everything and anything I know how to head off any problems I can even try to control.  Ladies who are wig shopping...Check with your local Americian Cancer Society branch. They donate wigs made of human hair from Locks of Love to local hair salons who will volunteer to distribute, fit, cut, and color them for free. They can tell you who in your area participates. I found out because my daughter is a cosmetologist. Using cold caps hoping not to lose hair, but wig is ready if I need it. Also check out the Look Good, Feel Better sessions on makeup application, drawing on eyebrows, handling skin and nail changes, scarf tying, etc. Find out through ACS or your onc center. Free session, nice makeup freebies, and good tips, or so I hear. Going on Monday. There are also free websites that donate hats and turbans, and a program where a \"chemo angel\" will send little notes and gifts of encouragement as you go through chemo. I will look this stuff up again and post later if anyone is interested.Got my breast prosthesis (foobie) today and bought a bathing suit half price while I was at it. Merry Christmas to me! Reconstruction has been delayed till after chemo per PS recommendation.  Sunflower, thanks for the encouragement. Can't wait to be on the other side of this.Tammie, like you, I can't keep up with who is doing what without reading back and taking notes. I think Mardibra, Gator, and myself started yesterday, with several more due to start next week. My chemo day was very long. Checked in at 8:15. Wait. Called back for BP and weight check. Wait. Called back to see MO. Wait. Saw MO. Wait. Called back for infusion at 10:30. Admission checklist. Started pre-meds at 11:00. Got Benadryl, Aloxi, Emend, and Decadron, followed by Taxotere, Carboplatin, and Herceptin. Didn't finish till 4 pm. This is on a 3 wk schedule. Accessing the port stung a bit, but I was glad to have it. Much better than the recent digging for gold of veins during the two previous surgeries. All in all, it was pretty much what I expected EXCEPT for some weird reaction to what we think was the Decadron. Got sudden, intense, crushing, OMG, don't touch me, don't make me move, horrifying back pain. Now I had natural childbirth, so I am no wimp, but this was like the worst contraction ever that stayed at its' peak without stopping for like 10-15 minutes without stopping. The nursing staff acted like they had never seen anything like it, and wanted to give me Ativan for my \"anxiety.\" Um. Fail. The MO did stroll back a bit later and said that this is rare, but possible. Question is, was it an initial reaction thing, or something that's going to happen every time. Not looking forward to finding out next time, let me tell you. Was NOT prepared for that one.  Had Neulasta this morning. Took Claritin. Very tired and not much appetite today, but no other problems thus far. Hoping there won't be, but I understand it's a little too soon to call at this point. Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it. Will post some of those freebie links in a bit. Mardibra and Gator, keep me posted on your weekend, and deep breaths for those of you still waiting. It isn't as scary as you anticipate for the most part, and apparently my scary event was a fluke thing. Of course I'D do it, if it's remotely possible! One down, anyway!",

Trying to reach my MO today to talk about using Emend by mouth the day before and two days after chemo. Apparently they save this for people for whom nothing else works....! Didn't know it existed, found it by researching myself. Expensive. Insurance only covers so much...$164 out of pocket for each treatment. It's worth it if it works! Just thought I'd mention it for some of the others who have been hit hard with this also. I have a drippy nose, watery eyes and zits too, just for the record.  Terry, I feel mutilated too. Some of my friends didn't get it either. \"Just cut it off and get rid of it!\" was the consensus. Well, yeah, but.....it's hard. I wanted immediate reconstruction, my PS recommended against it because my diagnosis was so confused pre-surgically. Now I'm like you. I want it, but I also want to be done with this, vs having another series of surgeries. Not sure what my end decision will be. My husband couldn't be more loving or attentive, but intimacy is not happening, which makes me feel defective also. He says he just can't get past feeling like we're in crisis mode and once the chemo is over, he will be mentally in a better place to \"pick up where we left off.\" I need reassurance that I am still desirable...which leaves us in no mans land. I think it's fine to grieve ALL the things in our lives that are forever changed....and then we have to eventually accept that there's a new normal. I'm still working on that.  Someone (sorry, lost track who) asked about cold caps. There is a whole thread for that, but google Penguin or Elastogel cold caps. I have Elastogel, they're cheaper. It's quite a production to pack them in dry ice, transport to chemo, switch caps every 30 min. etc. My DH has taken on that job. I am day 19 from 1st chemo and haven't lost hair yet, though my scalp feels sore today. So I don't know if it's going to work or not, but I felt it was worth trying. Someone also wanted to know about nutritional supplements. I take COQ10 100 mg daily, to protect the heart. B6 is supposed to help with nausea and also reduce neuropathy, I take 100 mg daily of that also. Also for neuropathy, Acetyl-L Carnatine 500 mg a day. On another thread, L-Glutamine 30 mg a day was recommended for neuropathy also. I bought and tried it, but it's a powder that you dissolve in a beverage/pudding/applesauce, but it just really tastes so awful that I can't do it with the nausea. ",

Just kind of hit an emotional wall the last few days as it wasn't letting up. Sometimes it is hard to think that you will ever feel anything close to normal again. Went for Herceptin this morning, which is really no big deal, but just kind of came unglued. Think the staff was not sure what to do; I've been so upbeat every other time. Doing better tonight, was just overdue, I think.  Had to buzz my hair yesterday. Tried the cold caps, and did actually have alot of hair left, but was shedding everywhere.

Also had an MRI of the liver to take a second look. MRI of the right breast before mx saw a \"worrisome\" area that they thought was an affected lymph node, a subsequent CAT scan said it was not a lymph node but a hemangioma, which is a cluster of abnormal blood vessels that I was likely born with. Then an abdominal sonogram failed to find this area at all....so we still don't know what it actually is. Hopefully today's test will tell us something reassuring. Also had a pelvic ultrasound as there was a 4 cm mass on the ovary previously that they \"thought\" was a cyst; follow up was recommended to see if it is decreasing in size or not, if so, this is good, if not, may need a closer look. The tech refused to tell me if it could still be seen or even to turn the screen toward me. I know that they are not radiologists, and not supposed to interpret findings, but it is funny how some will kind of find a way to let you know that things are ok, and others seem to withhold information just because they can. It is MY body, excuse me, and I have been through so much already, just give me the dirt already! So of course, now I am concerned that it actually showed something she didn't want to tell me....when it was probably just fine. I don't think they have any concept of the anxiety you face in these situations. Then she wants to know why my blood pressure is 156/103. Ummm yeah.  OK....just needed to vent!",

Sounds like you know her well enough to decide how much to share at one time, and you will find your way through that in a way that feels best to you. Every person and every relationship has its' own dynamic; you know yours best.  Spent the afternoon taking outdoor autumn photos with all the kids, grandkids, and significant others. One of my stepdaughters is studying photography, and does a terrific job. Families are amazing things. As my daughter said, we are elastic. You can pull us pretty far apart, but we don't break! Every family has its' problems and imperfections, but if you are very lucky, you come together when it really matters. When everything else is in question, love is really all you had anyway. Feeling pretty emotional today, nervous as Thursday approaches, feeling like nothing will ever really be the same again, and I am saying goodbye to life as I knew it before. Have never liked the \"survivor\" terminology, but starting to understand it a bit better. Trying to pull myself out of the melancholies, and move forward with an acceptance of doing what must be done. Not easy right now, but we will get there!  ",

Markat; doing the happy dance for good test results To all those on our second round; hoping for minimal SE's and the ability to enjoy at least some of the holiday. Had discussion with MO about the severity of my nausea last time. Will be taking the Zofran starting now, not waiting till nausea starts. Taking PO Emend today and for next two days to spread effects out more. Starting ginger supplements. Finally, he gave me tiny doses of liquid Haldol to take if and when nausea starts. Says it's an old tried and true that worked; they just don't do it much anymore because there's so much new fancy stuff...which obviously is not working for me. He also said women with very bad nausea during pregnancies (check) history of motion sickness (check) history of post operative vomiting (check) and narcotic/sedative hypersensitivity (check) are at very high risk for extreme nausea with chemo. Well, imagine that! So he totally believes me (thaaaaat's nice!) and it's a matter of playing around till we hopefully find the combo that makes this tolerable. Y'ok! Hoping that's sooner rather than later. I already informed my family that this is my ONE AND ONLY trip down chemo lane no matter what happens in the future UNLESS the nausea can be better managed. Other than that, it's sure not fun, but survivable. The four days of dry heaves if I even sat up last round should not be visited upon any living being. Hoping for better days this time. ",

I was a little goofy from steriod insomnia at 5 AM! So it's the night before chemo; and all through the house, I'm the only one stirring; I surely hope there's no mouse.  The stockings are draped on the high chair (don't ask why) with care, in hopes that St. Nicholas will wait till I'm no longer a bear.  Sara is nestled all snug on the couch; her bedroom's too hot, and I've lost my perch. I'm not yet wearing a kerchief, I've still got my hair. Brent has a cold, and he's snoring upstairs.  Now on my cell phone arose such a clatter; I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. I flew to the bathroom and turned on the light. I then found my glasses; without them, NO sight! There's (Thank God) no snow here, it's raining again. It's almost morning as I look out below.  Now what to my wondering eyes should appear..but a patient in labor who's texting....OH DEAR. From the sound of her voice, contractions so quick; I knew in a moment, it must be legit.  She paused then to breathe, and she timed them again. Five minutes apart for two hours they came. She's anxious for baby; it's the third call tonight. So dash away, dash away, dash away all. To L&D to determine if s/he is coming today. So up to the hospital this couple they flew. With suitcase and car seat, and baby's daddy too. And then in a twinkling, I heard on the phone, the labor nurse calling to keep me informed. I took a quick shower and drove across town, I'll admit the patient, then be chemo bound.  I am dressed in comfy clothes, prepared for \"the chair.\" A blouse that unbuttons to reach my port...there. We look like peddlers dragging all this stuff in. We must take our coolers to eat our lunch there. Another brings the cold caps to try and save hair.  My eyes, how they water; my cheeks are so fat. Compliments of chemo/steroids, oh, how I love that! My mouth gets so dry and my lips need some jelly. We won't even mention my expanding belly! I can't help but laugh, in spite of myself...for this is a season and this too shall pass. God's in control, I have nothing to dread. No more complaints, let's get down to work.  I've shopped and wrapped a few presents. I mailed all the cards and packages. There's a tiny tree twinkling and one batch of sugar cookies baked with grandchildren just for fun. It's Christmas this year on a much smaller scale. Somehow that's ok, it's just this one. We've had time to focus on those we hold dear, and the real reason we have this season each year.  I might not be able to join in on Sunday, but please know I love and am thankful for both \"real-time\" and online friends. Family is more precious than ever, it seems.  Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good day! ",
