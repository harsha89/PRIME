I've had 4 rounds of TAC and having my 5th tomorrow but I'm done! I've had enough of it. I want to quit after this next round tomorrow.Â  I'm meant to be starting my teaching placement in February and I just want to be normal again. The physical side I can sort of cope with but the emotional side is killing me - I don't think half a day passes without me crying. Can I just quit and continue radiotherapy? Does anyone have any inspirational stories about quitting early and everything being ok? I don't want posts that say 'keep going it's only one more'. I know that. But I can't stand anymore. I've heard that stress can cause cancer - ha ha that's ironic - chemotherapy is the most stressful thing I've ever been through and that's saying something! Please give me your thoughts and expert opinion. What benefit does the 6th TAC give you. (I've heard some treatments recommend between 4 and 6 rounds and that quitting at 4 is possible but I'm not sure about TAC treatment). Thanks guys Log in to post a reply",
