Severe joint and bone pain (actually the 1st was worse)- I am also dose dense. On the end of day 2 (the day after chemo) I get he flu like feeling- starting in my neck, jaw, back, etc Then wakeup 3rd day with the joint and bone pain which lasts for 3-4 days. I use ibuprofen during the day and hydrocodone for a night or two. With my 2nd Taxol I got some tingling/numbness on bottom of feet and right thigh and wrist/arm. Left foot better after 2 days, but rest still an issue 8 days after treatment",

Mine are incredibly kind and caring, and when my next set of appointment are scheduled- I sit there with them and we figure out what times and days work best for me. I am SO sorry you are dealing with people like that right now- how horrible! I know sometimes there aren't a lot of choices in an area for specialists like this :( But know that there are a lot of people who really do care (including total strangers like those of us on this board) and are very compassionate when dealing with cancer patients. So sorry!",

They said they dose people up (50mg) in case of an allergic reaction, but they gave it to me using a syringe into my IV and I about passed out- it made my head swim, I could barely talk- it was like I was completely drugged. Almost vomited a few times. Then I slept! It was the worst part of my 1st Taxol. With my 2nd Taxol- they said since I didn't have an allergic reaction they reduced the dose to 20 mg - and I asked that they give it in an IV drip rather than so quickly with a syringe, and it was much better. It still hit me after a bit, but not so badly. I hate taking benadryl unless I absolutely have to. They said next time they would look into reducing it to 12.5 mg.",

I am watching the last few drops in my drip bag of Taxol right now - this is my last chemo treatment - yay! To all- hang in there- the end of chemo will come and you will hardly believe that much time has passed. I spent most of my time over the last 16 weeks just managing symptoms/side effects. One thing that I have trid to is remain active, even during the severe pain (not as much during earlier chemo of A+C when I was terribly nauseous). Even when I was in severe pain and I walked like a 95 yr old - I took even short walks-it helped a lot!",

It is quite a rollercoaster ride. Just when I think I know what to expect, something else comes along. I had 4 dose dense (every 2 weeks) of A & C and the last 4 treatments (2 of 4 done) are taxol only. Thought I would escape without neuropathy on Taxol, but nope- foot pain yesterday (heel esp) and today foot pain and mild numbness on bottom of both feet :( Took a vit B6 supplement. I will tell you- for those of you asking- yes Taxol is MUCH better than A+C! I have even experienced severe joint/bone shooting spasms of pain with Taxol and it is still a million times better than A&C. Very little to no nausea, stlll extremely tired, but a million times better than A+C. As a matter of fact - if I say or think about A+C I gag. :( If I see a red/pink liquid, I gag. I felt so poisoned on A+C and feel none of that with Taxol. I hope you are all doing well, keep your spirits up- cry when you need to, but then think positive thoughts. We will be looking at the backside of this before long. http://ginakarasek.wordpress.com",

I am calling the day I receive chemo day 1 I worked all day on the 4th (day 2), really just felt as if I was just recovering from the flu - tired but no changes to appetite. From all the reading I'd done, I knew it could get worse, so I stayed home on Friday (day 3). I was so glad I did. I woke around 3:30 am feeling a bit nauseous and so I took my backup nausea med (prochlorperazine), then went back to sleep until 6 am- when it was time for my regularly scheduled Zofran (ondansetron)- which I am supposed to take every 8 hours for the first 4 days after chemo. I ate some dry rice chex, sipped water, then fell back asleep for a few hours. When I woke, nausea was mild, and I made myself nibble throughout the day and by evening I had some cream of chicken soup. By day 4 (Saturday), nausea was under control again, and I ate - carefully. I had oatmeal, yogurt, a banana, saltines, and whatever small amounts of things I could tolerate. By dinner I had a small grilled burger :) Today (day 5) - I actually woke up hungry and ate 2 saltines with my 6 am Zofran, and went back to sleep until almost 8 am. I had my normal yogurt and banana breakfast, an actual grilled cheese for lunch, and for dinner- grilled chicken, green beans and potatoes. I ate much less than I normally do, but it was a fairly normal meal :) I am very tired, and nap alot whether I intend to or not. I am easily fatigued, just short walks require some rest, but I feel it getting better each day. I am taking a walk with my husband each day- I have read that even if you are tired, try to keep moving. From past experience with bed rest during high risk pregnancies, I have found that it is a downward spiral, so keep moving as much as you can. The rest after exercise seems much more restorative than just laying around. I decided to keep a blog to share with my family and friends who are not nearby, and have found it to be catharctic. I made it public to hopefully help others as well, if anyone is interested in reading it: http://ginakarasek.wordpress.com On the right hand side of the blog page, you can click to follow it and you will get notifications whenever I update it. Good luck to all of you on your treatments!",
