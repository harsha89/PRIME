Heather, you are so right about being an advocate for my Mom. I am pretty sure the nurses and doctors have nicknamed me \"the pit bull\" behind my back. They always get that, \" uh oh, she's been researching again!\" look whenever I ask them about my Mom's treatment and handling of her SE's. :-) Just wanted to share something that has seemed to help my Mom with the dehydration. Coconut water. It's loaded with electrolytes with out all the sugar of Gatorade. It doesn't taste very good, but she uses it along with milk in her whey protein shakes and it hides the flavor and helps keep her hydrated an boosts her protein at the same time. I just bought some fruit punch flavored coconut water and will see if that is more palatable. It also helps with constipation so should probably be avoided with diarrhea.",

      "Content": "Dec 30, 2011 11:51PM - edited Dec 31, 2011 01:28AM by April1st Ok ladies. I found the website for the Cancer Fighting Kitchen Cookbook and it has some of the recipes from the book. rebeccakatz.com/recipes/ Yesterday I made a HUGE batch of the Magic Mineral Broth. It's serves as a great base for all her other soups and its yummy enough to sip on its own. I got the Kombu at the Market in the Asian section (it's seaweed, but you'll never taste it in the broth.) it seems like a lot of work at first but once you realize you don't have to cut the veggies into bite sized pieces it goes fast. You just wash chop a few times and throw into the pot, you'll be discarding all the veggies at the end anyways. I made about 8 qts. Total. And I'm already half way through it. I also made the \"Thai It Up Chicken Soup\" I couldn't find fresh lemongrass in my market so I bought the minced lemon grass in a tube in my Market's refridgerated produce section (near the packaged fresh herbs). The Asian food section had the rice noodles and coconut milk and I bought a lot of fresh ginger for this soup and also to make tea for Mom's upset stomach. It's a very mild tasting soup. My Mom loves it. Says its very soothing and not too overpowering. If you get the book, you'll also see \"Anytime Bars\" these have been great for when mom feels like snacking. I also made the \"dried fruit compote\", great for having in Yogurt and in your oatmeal. I found the recipes online. Here are the links www.myfoodmyhealth.com/HowItWo... books.google.com/books?id=vxN6... Another recipe I've made from the Real Simple web site is \"Baked Barley Risotto with Butternut Squash\" I leave the parmesan out because it's to much for Mom right now, but it's great without it. It's a very easy dish to make! Link: www.realsimple.com/food-recipe... Well that's it for now. Let me know if there are problems with any if these links. Happy to say mom is feeling okay tonight. I'm a little nervous since the 4th day was the one that was really hard for her last time. But we are keeping optimistic that this time will be different. I hope you all have peacefull nights of sleep. A",

Most all supermarkets will have it in their health food section. I always took for granted how lucky we are to have so many health food stores here in California until now! Is there any way I can post pictures here? If so, I'll take pictures of the recipes with my phone and post them. BJMRN- I think I already posted this, ( is it possible for a caregiver to have Chemo brain too?) but The Cancer Fighting Kitchen\" is available on Amazon.com and has been my go to book for recipes. Your husband can order it and get pretty fast. www.amazon.com/Cancer-Fighting... Thank you for all the encouraging words. It's my honor to take care of my Mom, heaven knows she took care of me for many years! Still does.",

From watching my friends with boys it seems Boys may wear you out physically but girls wear you out emotionally, they have the same hormones running around their little bodies that a teenager does going through puberty, but not enough language to express themselves. I've often thought that if my daughter knew how to flip me off it would cut her emotional tantrums by 50% at least. I just read a study that said the brain of a 3 year old looks similar to the brain of an adult sociopath. That sounds about right to me. Love that little girl!!!",

Mom is starting to feel the SE's so she's resting. I just gave her some milk of magnesia because she hasn't had a BM in two days and that's what caused the problems Last time. Trying to catch it before it wreaks havoc again. The coconut water does taste awful, the whey protein powder shakes mask the taste. We buy whey because Mom's cancer is ER+ PR+ and we don't want to mess around with the Soy Protien powder. We blend some frozen berries in with the vanilla powder, almond milk and coconut water and it's nice and refreshing for her. It's great on days she doesn't feel like eating or drinking water She starts taking non drowsy 24 hour Claritin one day before her Neulasta shots and takes one every day until they are done (1 shot a day for 5 days) they have been a godsend in helping with her bone pain. These boards have been a great source for learning about these tips for getting through the SE's. Mom's doc recommended B6 vitamins to help with the nerve pain. I had been told about L-Glutamine but Mom's doctor said there are some studies showing that it hinders the Chemo's effectiveness so She said we shouldn't do it. I spent yesterday cooking up a storm. I'll post some recipes soon. Really helps to have the fridge stocked before the SE's hit. Mom has been brushing and rinsing with a soft brush and biotene toothpaste and rinse. No alcohol in it and it seems to help with mouth pain. So much more to write but the floats call so that's it for now. Hope you all are having easy, peacefull days. April",

I know how frustrating it has been for Mom to not be able to do what she normally does. I can only empathize. I have no idea what this must be like for you. If its any help, my Mom's oncologist was right, this second round is much more manageable. I hope this is the worst of it for you. Thank you for the tip on the whey powder. Ive been told that Processed sugar is like food for cancer, so anytime we can cut it out it makes me smile to think that we are starving those malicious cells to death. WaveWhisper- I'm so happy that you are feeling better! Anniebell- how are you doing today? Momof3boys- first of all, three boys?!? My one girl has me exhausted, I salute you! Have you taken claritin for the joint pain? Worth a try if you haven't. And I wish I could cook for all of you. You are all brave beautiful warriors. Nothing less. Josie4- your kids must have been so happy to get to go on a bike ride with you! Alright, the little one is looking for Mommy again so off I go. Wishing you all a good pain and stress free day.",
