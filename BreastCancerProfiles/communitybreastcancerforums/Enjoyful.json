A lot of my doctor-related anxiety abated when I found a new, confidence-inspiring doc.  I hope you can find the same. Hugs to you! E",

I don't know your specific circumstances, but maybe this applies (from http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/cobra.html): \"To qualify, individuals must experience a COBRA qualifying event that is the involuntary termination of a covered employee's employment. The involuntary termination must generally occur during the period that began September 1, 2008 and ends on May 31, 2010.... The premium reduction applies to periods of health coverage that began on or after February 17, 2009 and lasts for up to 15 months. See Continuing Extension Act of 2010.\" This seems to say that as long as your qualifying event occurred before May 31, 2010, you're still eligible for a total of 15 months of benefits.  They're just not giving that benefit to anyone who had a qualifying event AFTER May 31.  Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong! Best wishes, Suzanne! E",

Decreased levels may occur in a number of conditions, particularly: In diabetes, your potassium may fall after you take insulin, particularly if your diabetes had been out of control for a while. Low potassium is commonly due to \"water pills\" (diuretics); if you are taking these, your doctor will check your potassium level regularly. Additionally, certain drugs such as corticosteroids, beta-adrenergic agonists such as isoproterenol, alpha-adrenergic antagonists such as clonidine, antibiotics such as gentamicin and carbenicillin, and the antifungal agent amphotericin B can cause loss of potassium.

Wow, so sorry about the car accident on top of everything else!  PET scans can light up for a bunch of different reasons.  I had some lymph nodes light up, but a biopsy revealed normal lymphatic reaction to some sort of infection.  More recently, my thymus lit up; they think it's \"thymic rebound,\" a reaction to the chemo, but they're going to watch it. There's usually an SUV score on the PET scan report.  I believe that the higher the number, the more likely it's cancer.  My thymus had an SUV of 3.7, if that helps.  If your doctor thinks it's inflammation, then likely the SUV is low or there were other non-cancer indicators.  I hope it's \"just\" inflammation!  Best of luck to you!

I'd always been told I had dense breast tissue but was laughed at when I asked if it was a risk factor and/or a problem.  My mammos and ultrasounds were clear for years, including the ones performed 6 months before diagnosis.  The mammos and US missed SIX freakin' tumors in my right breast.  Once they knew I had cancer, though, a follow-up MRI showed everything.  Too late for me - diagnosed at stage III and now stage IV. I've heard that mammograms are only 60-70% accurate.  Isn't that a failing grade?  I think we can thank our health insurance companies for paying only for mammograms and not the MRIs that could have saved us a lot of heart ache.

Just to let you know, before diagnosis I had always been active, had a healthy body weight, never smoked, drank rarely if at all, had a baby before I was 30, breast-fed my daughter, began menstruation after age 12 (you know, all the low-risk factors) and I still got cancer.  Just days shy of my 5th cancerversary, it came back even though I continued what I considered a healthy lifestyle.  This doesn't mean it's hopeless and you should go out and abuse your body, but sometimes crap happens and we have no control over it. So please don't blame yourselves for your cancer.  Guilt can't be good for our health either!  Going forward, lose the weight because you'll feel better mentally and physically and because you'll be healthier overall.  Good luck and good health! E Edited to add:  I wondered as I read that article whether dosage was the issue.  If they're using the same dosage of chemo and/or hormonal and other therapies for everyone, wouldn't it make sense that overweight persons would have poorer results?",
