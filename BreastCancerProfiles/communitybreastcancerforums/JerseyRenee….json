I am almost 42, & just had my 1st mammo last Monday, yes I procrastinated on it. Called me next day for diagnostic then Friday Stereotactic Biopsy. All this in one week & now into week 2 with the stress & sickness awaiting results. I also had microcalcifications. They were in a branching , linear configuration which is why suspicious. BIRADS4- suspicious. Good luck to you on your Biopsy! I will be thinking of you!!!",

As others stated to me on here I now will pass on the same advice which is to take deep breaths & take it day by day! Trust me there will be a roller coaster of emotions! I have cried & got angry to the point I am sick of seeing pink. Just seeing it is a reminder my diagnosis happened during breast cancer awareness month. Not even a month after my diagnosis I have already seen medical oncologist, genetic counselor, breast surgeon, plastic surgeon & today MRI was done. Trust me we all know what you are going through! This is why the support you receive on here is so tremendously helpful! I am thinking of you! {{hugs}} ",
