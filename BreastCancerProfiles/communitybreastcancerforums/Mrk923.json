It is my understanding that they are designed to work with your natural muscle movements to move fluids out and compression sleeves don't work while sleeping because you are sedentary? What I wear at night is more like a tubular bandage that a therapist gave me. It has extremely light compression. The therapist also gave me an isotoner glove that is very light and works well.   My therapist also recommended the Farrow Wrap that can be worn day or night. I have tried it and it works but I have trouble getting the velcro strips adjusted just right so I prefer the traditional bandaging. You're right about those finger wraps.....   ",

I also have back problems and have to sleep on my side. So now I always wear light compression along with a glove and try to sleep on my good side..Occasionally I will roll over to the bad side and slightly elevate my bad arm on a pillow for a short time and then roll back to the good side. This usually works well for me. Sometimes if my arm is feeling a little achy in the evening or I think I may have overdone it with activity during the day or my back hurts I will wrap up with compression bandages before going to bed. According to my LE therapist I can sleep on either side if I'm properly bandaged. So far, I haven't had any problems. This is a bit time consuming but with practice I've learned to wrap up pretty fast. I also bandage up before flying just as a precaution. They do make special nighttime garments for LE that are supposed to work well but I haven't wanted to spend the money to try one of those yet. My insurance deductible is too high to even bother for now. Good luck with your surgery..... Toni",
