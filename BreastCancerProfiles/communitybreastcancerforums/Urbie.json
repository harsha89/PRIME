I went in for a routine mammogram (only my second one because I am 40 years old) and they called me back for another look. Long story short is that a biopsy determined that I have IDC and quite a bit of DCIS in my right breast. I went through ALL of the tests and it doesn't appear to have spread, but I have decided to have a bilateral mastectomy on August 16 and to have reconstruction start the same day. I can't seem to find out much about recovery time for the surgery. How long will it be until I can get back to my life? And even with bilateral surgery, will I always be afraid of it coming back?

Paxton - they told me today that if I have diarrhea to take Imodium AD - take 2 tabs after 1st liquid stool than 1 tab every hour if still having liquid stools, for up to 12 hours.  If no relief after 12 hours to call the doctor.  Seems like a lot of Imodium, but that is what they told me.   I go in tomorrow morning for a Neulasta shot - they say that my insurance approved it, which I cannot believe because I have no coverage for brand name perscriptions.  But maybe because it will be administered in the hospital it falls under some other category??  I am just hoping that I can get more of this Emend because today went fine.

      "Content": "Oct 1, 2007 09:08PM - edited Oct 1, 2007 09:08PM by Urbie Well my first chemo session is behind me!  And it went really pretty well.  The only problem was finding a vein that would work.  First one had a valve that wouldn't open, second one collapsed because I flinched and held my breath, third one was working fine but I got up to go to the bathroom and the bag was empty (small one Ativan & Benedryl) and the blood got sucked up into the tube.  It clotted before they could flush it so they needed to go to vein number 4.  They served snacks, tea and lunch!  And I even got my feet massaged!  It was actually a nice morning and I am still feeling fine.  I know that it is wishful thinking that it will last, but one can hope. I go in tomorrow morning for a Neulasta shot - they say that my insurance approved it, which I cannot believe because I have no coverage for brand name perscriptions.  But maybe because it will be administered in the hospital it falls under some other category??  Now my challenge tomorrow is to convince my ps to squeeze me in for a fill in my tissue expanders.  They say I have about 7 days until my white count drops so it shouldn't be a problem (theoretically).  I may have to beg....  I want this reconstruction and exchange done by the end of the year!  New boobs for Christmas :o)   Goodnight all and I hope you are all feeling good.",

I am using Crest Pro-health toothpaste and Biotene mouth wash regularly so I hopefully can steer clear of the mouth issues.  Only time will tell.  Day by Day it seems, but I can't complaine too much compared to some of you.  Keep your eyes on the finish line ~ it will be worth it.   Good days to you all.",

I felt VERY drugged and spacey from the anti-nausea drugs.  Made me wonder why they don't warn you not to drive.  I wasn't sure if I would actually get to where I was trying to get to! ",
