But they can't do that. What they don't tell you is that at least for some of us, any benefits to reconstruction are a toss up. We are perpetually uncomfortable, need to wear a bra 24/7, the pectoral muscles are not thrilled with being displaced (if you have under pec implants) (hello perpetual physical therapy), you are wearing internal \"ice packs\" (silicon implants are not self-heating). I am still angry at the sugar coating the medical community gave these things I have to live with for the rest of my life (and yeah, I could go through another procedure to have them and their capsules scraped out of my chest, but I am not sure what the end result would be). Find yourself a good prosthetic bra, at least you will be able to take it off! Be proud of your decision.",
