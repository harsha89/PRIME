Tumor markers continue to rise. Up from 180-500. Have been through mln0128 trial, Navelbine, Halaven. Currently between drugs. Ibrance, fulvestrant, Xeloda, Abraxane, letrozole all also failed. I don\u2019t know what my onc will want next. I have asked for Keytruda but she says it\u2019s not approved for BC yet (but lots of people are in trials or got it free under compassionate care). I\u2019m in Dallas but I will flee to MDA-Houston if they have something for me. Is this normal to just go through drug after drug every 2-3 months?! I\u2019ve done Foundation One and they didn\u2019t find much. Approaching 3 years with stage 4. Fed up but still feel pretty good.",
