The best thing to do is realize that this is the hand fate gave you.  Play it the best way possible.   You can cry, whine and etc, as long as it doesn't become a habit.  Seek counseling if one needs it.  I have always found that the best helping hand is at the end of my own arm.  This has kept sane with the ability to go with the punches.  Sort of like that punching bag little kids have.  Punch it down and it comes right back up.  I am in my 16th year from dx.  I Best, DJ ",

Let your husband deal with the insurance companies.   Sometimes bad things happen for no reason at all.  Prior to my original dx, I had a minor surgery that turned into a staph infection that nearly took my life.  Then the dx, for a year I felt what it might be like to step into hell.  Life did right itself eventually.  I have lots of other medical conditions and the best way to deal with it all is to just keep moving.  You will adjust and enjoy life again.  I went on Arimidex for my 3rd recurrence and then had the time of my life.  I travelled and did everything I wanted to do.  Good thing I did, as I can't these days.  So be patient in a little while you will be living your new norm.

See a surgeon about having the tumor remove.  Don't just allow the cancer center to call all the shots.  Everyone has their specialty.  Surgeons will recommend surgery, radiologist will recommend radiation and oncologist will recommend chemotherapy.  See the one who will help your friend best.

The tumor board initially recommended chemotherapy, my oncologist thought I would respond better to hormonal therapy.  Is your mother at all ER or PR positive?  I had chemotherapy when initially diagnose, I never thought it worked.  Tamoxifen didn't either and 4 yrs later I had a recurrence.  My cancer is slow growing.  I wonder if that might not be the case with your mother? On this board a few years ago, I read about a woman whose cancer was similar to mine. She had one of the best known oncologist in this country.  He said because her cancer is unaggressive, chemo works best on quickly dividing cells, her cells were slow.  it was best to keep to hormonal. My original tumor showed a grade of 3 which were fast growing cells.  However, my history shows it to be slow.  My 2nd recurrence was in 2 ribs.  They just showed up again on the recent scan, so it took them 11 years to return.  Figure my cancer is slow.  It's a wild possibility, a real wild card but, if she is ER or PR+, would hormonal work better?  Perhaps she has had them all and that is why the chemotherapy.  I have heard good things about Halavan.  Just a thought.   All my doctors (have a lot of other serious medical issues) find it hard to believe with what showed up in the last recurrence, I was still around.  Don't give up on her, keep trying to find answers.  I wish your mother well on this journey.  She is very fortunate to have such a helpful daughter.
