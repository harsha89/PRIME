That's why they give you chemo to try and mop up any rogue cells that might have slipped thru.  We just have to hope it did it's job well. I saw my BS this week and asked him if 10mm was big and laughed (nicely) and said they can be as big as a tennis ball !!!  Really the only thing we know for sure is the more lymph nodes affected ( usually 4 or more) then the more likely chance of any metastatic  occurance  down the line  Also it's good to find out if the nodes came out easily with no extra capsular extension or were matted ( not a good thing). You mentioned clear node margins so sounds like at least it was all contained in the node  I asked my onc about vasolymphatic invasion and she explained that the breast tissue slides they analyse after Mx are really only a snapshot. Of time. I couldn't work out why I had a node w/o vasolymphatic invasion and the snapshot in time makes sense to me. It was there but moved to the node - if that makes sense?? ",

An article i found on PubMed  CONCLUSIONS: IMLN metastases are a marker for disease severity; recognition of this may influence choice of adjuvant therapy. The presence of metastatic disease in an IMLN is associated with a high rate of axillary nodal involvement, and should mandate axillary dissection. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy may help identify these extra-axillary metastases. 2timer - imlns are a marker for aggressive cancers but since your grade was 3 - you knew that anyway and at least your axillarys were clear ( YAY) and you have had double Mx plus chemo then i would think you have been as aggressive as you could be ",

I lost suction on one ( too active) but I had a spare - make sure you get one and they gave me a bag to hide the drain in and I just tied that to my jean waist - when in shower I hooked the bag over the tap so I had a spare hand - just keep your wound covered and waterproof as best you can My 2nd drain came out day 10 You will be FINE I never felt a thing with either !!!! Sounds weird but its true I was told after Mx not to drive with drains in ( but I did about a week after Mx). I also had full ALND and played 18holes of golf three weeks post Mx - might have been different if I had had a Dbl Mx. Don't know The Mx isn't too bad and once out of theatre they only ever gave me Tylenol in Hosp Good luck when it happens - I am fast thinking there is a lot of negative stuff on forums and not enough positive posting to balance the books :))))) Day 3 post round 3 TC and no ill effects yet.

Yikes Infusions all good once they found a good vein :(((( ended up in back of my hand this time after attempting my arm great considering I forgot my ELMA today and it would have been in the wrong place - chemo pharmacist !!!!!!! Claratin will not help sinus' pain unless it is due to hayfever. They do in AUS make a combo called Clarinase here which is loratadine and pseudo ephedrine that might be a better choice for cytoxan sinus. even plain old pseudo on its own if your MO allows Also going back to neulasta and claratin they also make a desloratadine version that is stronger/ more effective than loratadine for hayfever and therefore might be even better for bone pain. its called AERIUS here in AUS and made only by claratin manufacturers. I wore my wig and was only one. Others all had scarves ( or very good wigs !!!!). I feel self conscious but everyone tells me it looks really natural.

So can let you know more then. Since I am not doing rads I suspect she will just check oestrogen levels and put me straight on tamoxifen. My onc appt is slightly later due to having been in UK but am really interested to see what my bloods, liver and hormone levels are doing. I have no scans planned and don't expect to get anymore done since CT and bone scans were all clear in June They dont like scanning unless there are suspicious symptoms and I have none :) To all those finishing up chemo awesome job - Angela and anyone else that finish line is getting closer for all July firecrackers and a month out my stamina is definately back to where it was prior to chemo - after all the walking around disneyland , Paris and London. A mere 18holes of golf this morning felt easy ( and I got my best score for 2013) so the old me is back detoxified and better than ever before and we will all experience that sooner or later As Hannariggs (I think) put it - we are all so fortunate to have been able to help, encourage and be there for each other on this crappy journey - this forum has been an absolute lifeline for me - congrats to you and your daughter for being so caring and generous Donna - so pleased for you re scans - that's awesome news Xx",

Fascinating ( that's the pharmacist in me). Rambos floss advice sounds logical to me Soriya re my nausea meds. They gave me kyril 2mg to take at 7am on day 2 and 3 and I never needed the breakthrough nausea meds so middle of the night wasn't an issue for me If you are awake take it if not be happy you are asleep think it is only the first 3 days really anyway the nighttime dex dose should cover you overnight WBC update post weekend Oh and my oestrogen levels looked perimenopausal anyway <100nmg So bye bye ovary function ???",

Probably only a matter of time but I try to keep exercising and keeping weight down to try and stave it off Jerigrace it sounds like you have a lot of juggling to do ... Am Sure I read about a possible connection between BC and low thyroid... How long ago was yours removed? Rambo I have my chemo kit in the bathroom and a chemo bag that accompanies me everywhere ( yes even the golf course) My second dose is August 2nd reckon there is a heap of us all that week Scribblinhanna must be hitting her second by now and hunnybunny must be this week maybe??? I need spreadsheet to keep up with who's doing what and when with these different regimes :)))) Feel free to talk anytime jeriG isn't that what time differences are for??

As we know at day 10 my neutrophils were 100 also. Although I was fortunate enough not to get the fever or an infection ( just that chronic toothache ) I have new WBC count being done tmrw. So it will be really interesting to see how they bounce with out neulasta. After 20 days Re the generic loratadine there should be no reason why they did not do their job, the active ingredient and strength would be identical however the fillers are sometimes different ( starch, glucose, gluten etc). Occasionally the absorption can maybe be slightly altered because of this. But if this was really the case then substitution with generics would never be permitted so in answer to your question - in theory no - in practice it seems to happen occasionally. There are generics that are actually manufactured by the originator brands known as 'cross-licensed'. These normally come off the same conveyor belt. Maybe you could source some of them ( the originators make them to try to grab the generic market for themselves as well as the original brand ) Who is slated for rads after their chemo??? . I have been told I don't need them and am ??? If that is OK. I had very clear margins and my node had not gone extra capsular (yay) appreciate any feedback. NC x",

I suspect that giving that much later it will nearly have a chance to really kick in b4 your next cycle. So you maybe well be neutropenic for a little longer The main worry was usually if you give it at same time as chemo that the poison will kill off the immature stem cells and that might cause more probs. so moral of story probably better later than earlier or u could just skip it for this cycle- you are traveling well . Next time If you keep having it ask to take it home and self admin 24hrs post chemo - that's what I have done for 2 rounds - it's EASY to do and painless in stomach as long as you do it slowly. How brave to consider rocking the bald If it was me I would definately wear a wig or scarf Lana. But it is your choice. I teased H yesterday about going out bald and he never skipped a beat. I still wore my wig though. I don't even notice it really now and loads of people have said to jeep my hair like that when it grows back. But I would never have the time or patience to persuade my hair daily to have such volume. Maybe I will just keep the wig. Haha Anyone else's eyebrows thinning ?? Rambo you are very quiet ??
