I also have some rib and back pain and some painful, little bumps in the crease under my breast. But all this is tolerable compared with the sudden spike in my bp over the past two weeks. I'm talking like 150/100 as compared with 125/85. I take Norvasc 5mg which has always worked really well for me. Now it doesn't seem to be working at all. It takes my bp down for a few hours but by the end of the day it's back to 140/100 or higher. Nothing in my routine has changed -- same basically vegetarian diet, same yoga and meditation routine, same exercise regime. The only thing different are the rads, but all my docs say it couldn't be related. Has anyone else seen this? Does it go away after rads are finished? Please tell me I am not a nut-job or a hypochondriac like my docs seem to think. Thanks so much for any words of encouragement.

I had a lumpectomy and am now going through chemo (4 rounds of dose-dense AC followed by 12 taxol and 1 year of herceptin). They have also recommended 35 radiation treatments once the chemo is done. But now my mo is sort of nudging me to get genetic testing, but I'm not sure I want this information. I mean, I have already had cancer. I also have a strong family history of cancer. I have no sisters or daughters or close female relatives who could benefit from this info, so why should I carry that burden for the rest of my life knowing potentially that my body is coded against me. Furthermore, if it turns out that I have the gene, will I feel pressured to have a preventive mastectomy? Is that what I really want? I'm very ambivalent and could use some guidance.
