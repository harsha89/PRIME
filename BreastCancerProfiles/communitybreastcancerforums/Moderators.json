While not cancerous, these lumps may grow. And any solid lump that's getting bigger is usually removed to make sure that it's not a cancer. Fibroadenomas are the most common kind of breast mass, especially in young women.\" Even though your doctor suspected a benign mass that's most common in young women like you, it's still important to have it checked. Please keep us all posted on what you learn from another doctor, and best wishes! \u2022 The Mods",

The scans, and if needed, the biopsy, are needed to be then interpreted by a medical professional. We are glad you have this scheduled but sympathise regarding the waiting over this timeframe, especially with what you've just been through. The waiting is a horrid time and long waits are very hard. Just try to concentrate on the odds being in your favor and that your body is probably having a lot of hormonal changes. Researching, without info on what at least scans show, can lead you to so many possibilities that it may not be wise to do too much until you know more. Dr Google can be a dangerous place as is usually takes you to the extremes, so beware. We wish you all the best for 6 Jan and a benign result. The Mods",

We know how stressful it can be to have changes to your breast health that are unexplained. When you see your doctor again, explain your concerns to her, and let her know that you would feel better and more at ease if she sent you for a consult with a breast surgeon. The report you quoted above simply states that there were no abnormal findings in the mammogram, and that an ultrasound was needed for follow-up (probably because they couldn't locate the lump, which is fairly common). If the radiologist from your ultrasound included in your report to have a surgical consultation, it could be that the results from the scan were incomplete, or because he wants to be thorough, which is a good thing! Changes in your breast health, no matter how insignificant they seem, should always be taken seriously. We would suggest following up with your OBGYN, and pushing for a referral to a breast surgeon, even if it's just to put your mind at ease. Please let us know what your next steps are, we'll be thinking of you! The Mods",

Like Jennie said, we haven't heard of a seroma at an incision site increasing your chances of developing lymphedema, but radiation can raise the risk. There are steps you can take pre- and post-surgery, to help alleviate your chances of developing it, and some things you can do to manage it and prevent flare-ups. You can find that information on our main site: http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/lymphedema/r.... We also sympathize with the change to your physical activity. You want to give your body a chance to recover after surgery, but you also want to be in the best shape you can be as you start on your treatment journey. There are some modified exercises you can do to stay active, until you're close to 100%. As with anything related to your healing, you'll want to discuss this with your doctor to make sure you're cleared for physical activity. Also, asking for a referral to a physical therapist with experience with breast cancer patients might be a good place to start! In the mean time, some information on exercising after surgery: http://www.breastcancer.org/tips/exercise/treatment/surgery Please let us know if you have any questions, or if you need assistance in any way.

There can be many explanations for the symptoms you're experiencing, but it is important to get to the bottom of what's going on.

Here is a link to a page on our main site about the actual Biopsy procedures. Hopefully that will provide some information about what to expect. Most anyone who has waited for the results of a biopsy will say that the uncertainty and not knowing is the worst thing to manage. Our minds tend to try to figure out what will happen so we can try to cope with the outcome but we tend to lean in the direction of the results being worse than better. It sounds like you have had your share fare of trauma and stress and that must make this all the harder. It also sounds like you have risen above a lot of obstacles in your life so remind yourself of that. Mostly try not to focus on the worst case scenario. The chances are that these lumps could well be benign and not worth the worry that you are giving them. Good for you for mustering the courage to get them checked out and for reaching out here. Distraction is key to getting through the rest of the week. Keep us posted on how things go on Monday. We are here for you. The Mods",

We're sorry for what brings you here, but we're very glad you've found us, and hope you find the support and information you're looking for! PET scans are not typically used diagnostically for breast cancer, because of their unreliable screening ability. For example, to answer your question, yes, benign lumps can indeed show up on a PET scan. While cancer cells grow faster and absorb more glucose (thus making them glow brighter on a scan), benign tumors and lesions can also absorb large amounts of glucose, as can infections and inflammations. So false positives on a PET scan for fairly common, which is why a scan is usually followed up by a more thorough diagnostic test (in your case, a mammogram). The majority of breast lumps turn out to be benign, so the odds are definitely in your favor that this will end up being nothing for you to worry about. We know it's hard not to worry, but try to remain focused on your favorable odds, and think positively! Once you have your mammogram, you'll have more answers. We're hoping your results are benign, please keep us posted! The Mods",

We're sorry for the worry that brings you here, but we're glad you've found us, and hope you find the support and advice you're looking for! Given your young age, even factoring in your family history, it would be very unlikely that this turned out to be a malignancy. Breast changes are very, very common, especially in young nursing women. Lymph nodes can also swell unexpectedly and without explanation. That being said, your doctor would not have said whether or not it was cancer, because without testing such as an ultrasound or biopsy, there is no way to say definitively that it is not. An ultrasound is standard protocol and is used quite successfully in identifying fibroadenomas. Should the radiologist be unable to say one way or another what is going on, then your doctor may encourage you to move forward with a biopsy, to rule out cancer for certain. Please let us know how you're getting along, and what the results of your ultrasound are. We'll be thinking of you! The Mods ",

It's good to hear that you went to see your doctor the next day after finding the lump and although 8 out of 10 lumps are benign (not cancerous) it's important to get yourself checked out and have your mind at ease. Here are some links that you might find helpful to read in order to keep yourself informed about Breast Changes and Breast Lumps. Worried about Breast Lump Breast Changes There are many people in your situation, with health concerns and no insurance, however there is help out there. The link below has information on resources that you might be able to access. Help for People Without Health Insurance There is also an active discussion going on amongst members who either have concerns about breast lumps or have been diagnosed which you might like to post in.

Or any ultrasounds before all of this? Did she have any symptoms in her breasts like lump(s), bleeding nipple, etc? It is very difficult for us to tell what is negligence.

While the lump in and of itself may not be considered an emergency, five weeks can be a long wait emotionally when one finds a breast change. We wonder if you can call again and explain your situation. Typically a medical practice allots more time for a first appointment with a PCP. Perhaps they would fit you in or put you on a waiting list for an opening for a breast exam. You can inquire with an urgent care center near you. They may ultimately refer you back to your PCP. Again it may not be as much a medical emergency as an emotional one. It is completely normal to be concerned when a change in your breast presents itself. Most here would say that waiting for answers is the most stressful part of the experience. In the meantime it would be helpful to find some ways to distract yourself until you have some answers to your questions. Here is a link to some resources that can assist with free mammograms. Keep us posted. Hopefully others here will offer additional ideas. The Mods",

Pain, stress and anxiety can all cause teeth grinding while asleep and that can be a cause of tooth stress to cracking point.

We concur with the advice offered here by several of our members that it is best to seek the attention of a physician whenever you notice breast changes. We are not physicians and cannot diagnose your situation or comment on your pictures. We do realize how very stressful such changes can be. Remember that you are hearing from women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer but there are other possible reasons for changes in the breast. Only medical attention can confirm any diagnosis, cancer or otherwise. Please keep us posted and let us know how you make out at your appointments. The Mods",

It is impossible for us to say what is going on as we are not doctors but most here will say that there are others reasons for breast changes besides cancer. It is always good practice to bring any breast changes, regardless of what they are to your doctor's attention so that you can get a proper diagnosis and hopefully some reassurance.

Your problem needs to be assessed by a Doctor as they can view and feel the area and know your full history of age, stage in cycle, any prior injury, etc. All that needs to be done by a professional to decide what tests may or may not be appropriate or whether just antibiotics and time are the best course of action. Please see a doctor if you are worried about any changes in your breast. The Mods",

Only your doctor can accurately diagnose what's happening with your breast, so it's good that you've already made the appointment. Also keep in mind that while these kinds of changes to your breast are something to be taken seriously, IBC is very rare and only makes up between 1-5% of diagnosed cases of breast cancer. You can find more info about IBC here. Try not to over think it in advance of your appointment. Keep us posted with how it turns out, we'll be thinking of you! The Mods",

We're for the circumstances that have brought you here, but we're glad you've found us, and hope you find the support you need. Like Erica mentioned, you'll find many of our members were diagnosed and completed treatment without having an MRI. MRI's are typically reserved for screening women with a higher than average risk of breast cancer, to find out more about an area of concern that showed up on your mammo or ultrasound, and to monitor for recurrence after you've completed treatment. Most doctors, unless you meet one of the above criteria, won't order one (and most insurances won't pay for one unless it is deemed medically necessary). You can read more about MRI's and how they're used here: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types.... That being said, if you don't feel comfortable or confident in your doctor, we second Notdoneyet's suggestion about seeking out a second opinion. This is someone who you'll be seeing a lot of, and who will be treating your very serious illness, so you want to feel as secure and take care of as possible! The Mods",

Besides sharing your experiences and learning from other members here at the boards, you may also want to take a look at the Breast Cancer 101 section from the main site, which is designed to help you sort through all of the information on our site to find what is more relevant to you right now and once you know your grandma's diagnosis. Our thoughts are with your family. Your gandma is lucky to have the family support she has. The Moderators",

We know it's scary, but please keep in mind that at your age, even factoring in your family history, breast cancer would be very rare. There are a number of explanations for both the lump and the swollen nodes, none of which are a serious health concern. However, the only way to rule anything out and know for sure is by doing hat you're doing, which is keeping on top of your breast health and following through with your doctors!

The opening paragraph is very straightforward about the importance of dealing with fatigue: No magic pill can cure your fatigue, but there are some medical treatments that may help. If your doctor doesn't respond well to your concern about these problems, find one who will. You must assert yourself if you know you've reached your limit and need help. The best doctor is one who appreciates the problem, is willing to listen to your complaints carefully, who knows enough about the problem to do an evaluation, and who is willing to treat the problem as part of cancer care. Be specific when you talk about your fatigue, such as, \"I get short of breath when I walk the five stairs to my office.\"",

It sounds as though your medical team is being responsive and acting properly to assess what they've found, and that's a great. They are investigating your breast change with all their tools. Next appointment, we suggest you try and have a friend or relative with you as the brain seems to 'shut down' and remembering exactly what was said is very hard. You could also ask if it is OK to record your next appointment (via your phone) so that you clearly hear their findings and can review it later, if needed. Waiting is not easy but beware of general searches on the internet as there is a lot of poor and inaccurate info out there. We hope this eases your mind while you wait for the results. May the MRI again be clear but show what is creating the pull. Hopefully other ladies will be able to give you their experiences of similar inward pulling from B9 causes. Best wishes, The Mods",

We are sorry about these recent breast changes but glad that you reached out here for some support. Most here will say that it makes sense to consult with your physician for any breast change to insure your breast health and peace of mind. You can do a search on the blue tool bar for \"indentation aerola\". Be sure to use the quotes. Such a search might reveal others with this issue who have posted about it. One caution is that sometimes people post on non cancer related findings that turn out to be benign and we don't necessarily hear back as to the conclusion. So don't be alarmed if that is the case.

We're so sorry for what brings you here, but we hope you and your mom find this to be a supportive, informative place. You've gotten a lot of great responses with some really good advice. We're going to second finding another oncologist, either on your own or by asking for a referral from your mother's PCP. It is so important that you both feel comfortable with her doctors, but also that you feel secure knowing that she's getting the best care possible. Get a hold of your mother's medical records, and just start calling around. You're going to need the information regarding her cancer and diagnosis when you speak with other doctor's offices. We strongly agree with what Dltnhm said above us: front desk receptionists and the people who typically make the appointments most likely won't be familiar with the specifics that you're discussing, so ask to speak to a nurse in the office, or leave a message (or several) for the doctor. Your mother is very lucky to have you as her advocate during all of this. We know how difficult it is to navigate, especially in the beginning! Please let us know if you have any questions, or need assistance of any kind. The Mods",

Sending our deepest sympathies to all of you who knew and loved her.  Stagefree's Story. \"Having joined Breastcancer.org more than 2 years ago, I was not a newbie at all to cancer. I was 'cured' from Stage 2 Hodgkin's Lymphoma at sweet sixteen, when I literally survived the pity looks & pessimistic comments on what I was going through. Back then, we relied solely on my medical team, having scarce sources to get information & more importantly support. I was alone, surrounded by my loving family and friends. \"As a textbook patient, I was not surprised at all when diagnosed with breast cancer at 37, as a long-term side effect of Hodgkin's Lymphoma. However, the metastatic bonus wasn't expected. The minute I learned it was not stage 1, 2 or 3, but 4 and that there was no stage 5, I calmly refused therapy. But wait! 20 years had passed and I had no idea about the new cancer therapies and for how long they could actually help me. My medical team insisted I do my research for final decision, which I am so thankful that I did listen to. After some gloomy news I received from Dr. Google, I met Breastcancer.org, a site full of not only up-to-date information on breast cancer and very helpful facts & suggestions (especially for dealing with side effects of each treatment), based on medical proof, but also a virtual sitting room full of ladies from all around the world, offering their support, guided by the site's dedicated moderators. With my past experience as a teen being so lost and alone during my treatment, I immediately hung onto BCO, and with the amazing information & support, I trusted I could give treatment a chance...and here I am, enjoying each day with good quality of life, still. \"My son was a first grader who just started reading when I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. Now I am optimistically looking forward to his last year in primary school, which indeed is next year. \"I know I am not alone, I know I can share information, I know I can give & take support, I know breast cancer is not the main part of my life. Scrolling through our threads on our private forum for ladies with metastatic breast cancer & Stage 4 breast cancer, anyone can witness our joyful moments, our will to live our lives, not just our cancer, as long as we can. Thank you BCO for providing this grand opportunity to me, connecting me to such adorable sisters only miles apart.\" -- stagefree (Ebru), Istanbul, Turkey, diagnosed at age 37 ",

There are many issues to consider and many variables in all treatments depending upon location, surgeon, your body's responses and your Dx. Your choice is a difficult one as you are in the middle, so the more you analyse others' responses to the same dilema, the better your decision will be for you. We understand that it is confusing, often overwhelming and there is so much information to read and consider but there is no easy way as YOU have to make the decision as to what is done to YOUR BODY. Sorry we can't help more. You are best talking with the other members. Waiting is a hard time but can be well spent in educating yourself on the options for treatment. Also take a budy into doctor meetings to take notes (or ask doctor if OK to record on your phone) as it is often hard to remember what was said, what drug names and treatment protocols were offerred after the meeting. The more info you have, the better and having a person to discuss optipons straight away can be useful. All the best The Mods",

Bloody nipple discharge doesn't automatically mean breast cancer; as MelissaDallas mentioned, cancer in both breasts would be highly unusual, The cause of the discharge is likely hormonal, or an infection of some kind. And consistently stimulating it is probably not helping, as it's causing irritation. It's good that your doctor is going to schedule the procedures as a precaution, as there seems to be something going on that needs to be addressed, but try not to panic. Given your age and the symptoms you're describing, it would be highly unlikely that this is anything more than a benign condition or some kind of minor infection. And don't worry, you didn't offend anyone! Kicks responds like that to everyone. We welcome in and all members who have breast cancer, or are worried they might have cancer, or just have questions that they need answers to. That's why we have this forum! Please know that you're welcome here! Let us know how the mammo and u/s go, we'll be thinking of you! The Mods",

It's normal to feel very scared and worried when you don't know what it is that you're dealing with yet. It can be hard, but try to take it one day at a time. Do you know what kind of biopsy procedure you will be having? You might find our page on Biopsy Techniques helpful to know what to expect when you go in. If it does turn out to DCIS (which it may not) there is a thread here in the discussion boards that may be helpful to you in understanding it all a bit better. A Layperson's Guide to DCIS Discussion Please do check in with again often and let us know how you are getting on. Sending big cyber hugs and kind wishes your way, From the Moderators.  ",

We're sorry for the worry that brings you here, but we're very glad you've found us. The fact that the other tests you've undergone have come back negative is a good sign, but given your history and your mom's passing, we can see how you'd be anxious about getting a resolution to the breast issues you're having. Is the specialist unwilling to do the procedure under local anesthesia? There definitely seems to be a sense of urgency in having the procedure, but the risks associated with general anesthesia are certainly to be taken seriously. We're assuming the specialist is aware of your familial history? Have you had a chance to speak with an anesthesiologist about the risks of the procedure under general? We're so sorry you're going through this, we realize it must not be easy to figure out how to proceed. Speaking with your doctors about your specific concerns would be the best place to start, maybe they can alleviate some of your fears about the procedure, the anesthesia, and the issue itself.

With dense breast tissue, a mammogram is often hard to read so an ultrasound is quite normal to be done. The majority of pre-menopausal women have dense breasts, so is a common problem, it just means you have more glandular/connective tissue than fatty tissue in your breasts. But, density can ONLY be determined by mammogram. Sorry but 5 mil would normally be 5 millimeters (just under a quarter of an inch) and is a measure of length not density. Someone else may have an idea but really you need the US and repeat Mammogram done anyway. Then discuss results with your doctor fully. It is often wise to have another friend or relative sit in on consults with a pen and paper taking notes, as is very hard to keep everything in your memory when you are trying to pose questions you need answers to, just a suggestion. Also gives you someone to discuss results with straight away without having to go through details again. We wish you a benign result and keep us informed. The Mods",

IBC is typically very aggressive, with symptoms developing and progressing quickly, often times within days and sometimes hours (http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/types/inflamm...). The fact that the symptoms you've described have developed over the course of the last few weeks, and given that your doctor seems confident that it's a hematoma related to the biopsy, are good signs.

You may find this page helpful, and read more about the Oncotype DX DCIS test here as well, that could be helpful. DCIS Treatment. Hang in there! Here is an excerpt from this page: The Oncotype DX DCIS test is a genomic test that can help you and your doctor make decisions about treatments after surgery for DCIS. The Oncotype DX DCIS test analyzes the activity of a group of genes that can help doctors figure out a woman's risk of DCIS coming back and/or the risk of a new invasive cancer developing in the same breast, as well as how likely she is to benefit from radiation therapy after lumpectomy. The Oncotype DX DCIS test results assign a Recurrence Score -- a number between 0 and 100 -- to the DCIS.",

You're sure to find Breastcancer.org a welcoming, knowledgable, and very supportive community of incredible members here to help you through your journey. You're sure to get many responses soon to help you get started. First, it's VERY normal to be angry, scared, and drained! You'll hear from many members that have experienced the exact same emotions -- all completely understandable. To discuss with others going through surgery right now, you may want to join in the October 2015 surgery thread. When you're ready for chemo and radiation, there are threads corresponding with your timeline as well. For some insight from other members on Cold Caps, see the thread on Cold Cap Users Past & Present. There's also helpful information on the main Breastcancer.org site's page on Cold Caps. There's also a forum for Young Women with Breast Cancer, who understand the fears about fertility problems after chemotherapy. Also, some very helpful info on the main Breastcancer.org site about Fertility and Pregnancy Issues Before and After Breast Cancer. Also, there's a very helpful Triple-Negative Breast Cancer forum, for you to meet others with a similar diagnosis. We know this may seem like a lot of info to take in all at once, so read it as you feel you can -- take your time. We're all here for you and please keep us posted on how you're doing! --The Mods Edited to add Triple Negative forum link.",

While most recognize find it important to discuss detection and \u201cprevention\u201d, the month of October appears to evoke primarily negative emotions: anxious, annoyed, angry, sad, frustrated, overwhelmed, excluded to name a few. Overall, respondents wish that there was more of a take home message and education around all the pink and survivorship: what is going on in the research, what could one actively do to prevent/reduce chances, sharing of more stories of MEN and women already experiencing breast cancer, more than one day acknowledging MBC, more clarity on where the money is going. Too much sexualization, silliness, impudent phrases and activities, and commercialization that do not seriously enough represent the seriousness of disease, feelings and experience. There is a concern that the pink and fundraising around it in October is going too much toward awareness, and not enough toward research and help in general for those who have already been diagnosed. There are many comments also discussing if \u201cprevention\u201d really exists, and resentment around that word. The survey will be up all month, so pass along, and we'll provide all findings at the end of the month!!  Take the survey now >>",

For others' information, here's a quote from this article at the main Breastcancer.org site, talking about shingles and a weakened immune system from bc treatment: People with all types of cancer have a higher-than-average risk of developing a viral infection called shingles, which causes a painful blistering rash. Usually it breaks out on the chest and back, although it can affect any part of the body. Shingles results from the reactivation of the virus that causes chicken pox (the varicella zoster virus). Once you've had chicken pox, the virus can lie dormant for many years in the nerve tissue near the brain and spinal cord. Cancer and its treatments often stress the body and weaken the immune system, which can lead to shingles. Shingles can be treated with anti-viral medications taken by mouth, such as Valtrex (chemical name: valacyclovir), Zovirax (chemical name: acyclovir), and Famvir (chemical name: famcyclovir). These work best when taken within 72 hours of the rash's appearance. Shingles-related pain can be treated with many of the pain medications described in this section, such as narcotic analgesics (also known as opioids), antidepressants, anti-seizure medications, and topical anesthetic creams.

Rather, it is used to complement other screening tests. If an abnormality is seen on mammography or felt by physical exam, ultrasound is the best way to find out if the abnormality is solid (such as a benign fibroadenoma or cancer) or fluid-filled (such as a benign cyst). It cannot determine whether a solid lump is cancerous, nor can it detect calcifications.\" We hope this helps! Please keep us posted on what you find out! --The Mods",

The label \"benign\" often makes people think that the mass is not dangerous and may not require treatment but the fact is that it can grow larger, creating a visible lump on the breast and causing some discomfort.

The fact that your biopsy came back benign is a really good sign. Biopsies are typically quite accurate in diagnosing cancer, so while we understand your fears and concerns, it's more than likely a lingering infection, or possibly a secondary infection related to your biopsy. If, at the end of this round of antibiotics, you're still experiencing the same (or worse) symptoms, definitely return to your doctor to try to get to the bottom on what's going on. Please let us know how it goes! The Mods",

It's very, very common to \"phase out\" when you're getting information you weren't prepared for or find hard to understand. Your discussion in person with your oncologist will definitely help -- and you may also want to bring a friend with you who can help recall information received, or bring a notebook to jot notes, or a recorder so you can capture all of the information you're being given. In the meantime, you may find some helpful information on the main Breastcancer.org site's page on When Do You Get Chemotherapy?, which helps explain dose-dense chemotherapy, which it sounds like what your doctor has suggested.Also, the page on Choosing a Chemotherapy Combination, helps explain why doctors usually recommend certain medications or regimens. Another helpful page is the Talking to Your Doctor About Chemotherapy page, which offers suggestions on how to get information about your doctor's recommendations and questions to ask. We hope this helps! Please keep us posted with what you decide. We're all here for you! --The Mods ",

Take a breath and settle a bit as it sounds like you have been seduced by googling your symptoms and leaping to a conclusion. Yes mammograms can leave you sore as the tissue is pressed quite hard. RA, being an auto-immune disease, is subject to flare ups when you are stressed (as you undoubtedly know) and this waiting is very stressful.

There are many types of breast cancer, so you need to have specific details to understand implications fully. You may find reading HER2 Status of interest, but you need to know if the report says HER2 - (good) or HER2+ before worrying about that gene. Invasions absent sounds good but you really ned to wait for the full interpretation from her Doctor. Tell her to write down questions she wants to ask before appointment, as is so easy to forget when in with Doctor. Knowledge is power and enables better rational assessments and questions, so is very important. Hopefully, someone else is going with her as two sets of ears hear more that one and have the other op[erson write down details discussed for later referral.

Sometimes the initial biopsies can capture the problem cells if you are very lucky. The post surgery biopsy being clear is good news. Your mother will still need to strongly consider following her doctor's/surgeon's advice of chemotherapy to ensure any loose cancer cells are dealt with. Your mother's doctors have all her results there to assess so they are best qualified to offer advice. Were any sentinel nodes removed as well? We wish you mother a SE free chemotherapy course, but everyone reacts differently. Your mother is lucky to have a supportive son like you. The Moderators",

It came back clear. I had a CT scan on Monday, November 3rd. It came back clear Those showed there were no cancer tumors anywhere else in my body. I had 3 of 15 lymph nodes removed test positive for cancer with one of the lymph nodes showing that cancer had broken through. There's a possibility of a cancer cell or more floating around looking for a place to land and start a tumor. 50% chance. I Saw the medical oncologist on Monday, November 3rd. I'll have an echo on the 20th then and a port placement on the 21st. Then my first chemo treatment will be December 1st. I'll have 4 treatments (1 every 2 weeks) of AC (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) and then 12 weeks of Paclitaxel aka Taxol. I will have to take the Nulasta shot as well. The talk of Radiation was thrown in there but not sure how many rounds. Then take the hormone blocking pill for 10 years he said. So I'll actually be joining in the December Chemo group. I am not looking forward to being bald in winter. lol I guess what I am asking, is this... I'm really concerned about being sick with the chemo drugs and trying to care for our 6 children at home as well as I homeschool. I'm almost to the point of telling the doctors that I don't want to do the chemo and radiation, etc. and just go to the hormone blocking pill. I have already had my bilateral mastectomies (on October 24th) with tissue expanders. I got two of my drains out yesterday and my first fill of 50cc. I'm nauseated today, threw up a little, and have diarrhea (sorry probably TMI). I'm crying as I type this. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to be so sick I can't homeschool and take care of my children. I took my temp and it's 99.1. I don't feel achy or anything. I thought about calling the doctor but don't want to sound like a whiner. Please any suggestions or thoughts. ",

You didn't mention whether or not your DCIS was hormone positive or not, were you tested? Sometimes, if the DCIS tests positive for hormone receptors, doctors will recommend hormone therapy following radiation and/or surgery, to lower your risk of recurrence. You can read more about that here: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/types/dcis/tr.... Again, welcome to the community, we look forward to seeing you on the boards!

It sounds as though your medical team is being responsive and acting properly to assess what they've found, and that's a great. Anyway, we recommend you to read the article What Mammograms Show: Calcifications, Cysts, Fibroadenomas, from our main site. It reinforces that there are many other benign masses, including some that are especially common among young women. Waiting is not easy but beware of general searches on the internet as there is a lot of poor and inaccurate info out there. We hope this eases your mind while you wait for the results. Best wishes,",

It is also a very aggressive disease that progresses quickly, so you wouldn't have symptoms come and go, and they wouldn't respond to cortisone cream. What you're likely experiencing is a skin condition or some kind of reaction. We would suggest getting in to see a dermatologist as well, if the appointment with your doctor doesn't yield any answers. Good luck! The Mods",

Your mother knows what it is all bout so probably best to tell her now rather than later. Also it may be helpful to read from our main site: IDC - Invasive Ductal Carcinoma where you'll learn about symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, etc. Possibly of interest too is the Oncotype DX Test We hope this helps!

We are sorry that these findings and subsequent testing and biopsies have brought you here but glad that you have been helped by reading here thus far. We hope that others might chime in. From what you describe it seems as though you need more definitive information from you doctor about what constituted the suspicion finding on the mammogram and the ultrasound. Is it possible that the lump you were concerned about was not thought to be suspicious but a subsequent finding was considered suspicious and needing biopsy. Can you contact your physician with your questions so as to be more clear about all of this? Do you have a sense as to when you might get the results? While others may chime in here we believe that more information about the results of your screening tests might be in order. Let us know what else we can do to be of help. The Mods",

Your family history does put you at higher risk, but that doesn't necessarily mean you have anything to worry about.

It is always advisable to bring any breast changes to the attention of your doctor. Perhaps the best way to proceed is to first find out what your doctor has to say about the lump. If you remain concerned then you might inquire as to how and why additional screening tests are used and for what reason and if you are not a candidate for further testing what are the reasons. Perhaps others will weigh in here but It is hard for us and our members to truly advise you as to what to request as we don't have enough information and we are not doctors.

We´re sorry to hear you're having troubles, especially with feeding your little 4 month old. Rashes and changes when breastfeeding are quite common but anyway, it is good that you are checking them with your doctor. Until other members come along to post we would like to make you a suggestion: You can use the \"Search\" button on the left side and enter some key words like \"rash breastfeeding\" and you can then view many posts of women in a similar situation to yours. Then you can post to them by private message if they are not currently posting on these forums. We hope this helps. ---The Mods.",

So if it's fast-growing, there may be some concern that it could get too big. If you have concerns about the surgery, there certainly isn't any harm in waiting 6 months and checking it, or getting a second opinion. Keep us posted and let us know what you decide! The Mods",

Waiting for results is so hard and many say is harder than getting their Diagnosis, as you feel so without control. We certainly hope for benign results all round, but if not we are sure you will find this a safe and friendly place to discuss fears, good and bad times and most importantly gain knowledge. Going into appointments with medical team members and having an idea of what they are talking about is so important. Also, when you go to obtain and discuss your results, take a friend or relative with you as it is someone else to hear the news and either celebrate with or discuss results with. Two pairs of ears also hear and remember more, which can be useful. We wish you all the best and feel free to contact us, if needed. The Mods.",

The odds of you having IBC, or any breast cancer, at your age, are very, very small. IBC is a very serious disease, but it is quite rare, making up only between 1-5% of all breast cancers. Typically, symptoms of IBC will present and get worse in a very short amount of time. They don't come and go. What makes IBC so dangerous is how aggressive it is, so a rash showing up, then disappearing, then coming back a month later, is not indicative of IBC. However, any breast changes should be checked out by your doctor, as they can be symptoms of something else going on. We're not medical professionals, so we can't diagnose you, but our advice would be to set up an appointment with your gynecologist and have him/her look at the rash, just to be on the safe side. Please keep us posted on how it goes! The Mods",

The doctors can only guess until the biopsy results come back (sorry more waiting) but once they have biopsy results, they can then tell you benign or problematic. You need to try and settle until then, anyway possible and Wrenn is right, trying to 'read' facial expressions of people you don't know is risky, and they can't really know from scans anyway, only biopsy results. It sounds as though your medical team is being responsive and acting properly to assess what they've found, and that's a great. Anyway, we recommend you to read the article What Mammograms Show: Calcifications, Cysts, Fibroadenomas, from our main site. It reinforces that there are many other benign masses, including some that are especially common among young women.

Anyway, we recommend you to read the article What Mammograms Show: Calcifications, Cysts, Fibroadenomas, from our main site. It reinforces that there are many other benign masses. Waiting is not easy but beware of general searches on the internet as there is a lot of poor and inaccurate info out there. We hope this eases your mind while you wait for the results.

If your appointment with the surgeon is on the 8th, and you leave on vacation ten days later, it's unlikely that you'll have the results from any tests the surgeon orders; if he feels like a biopsy is necessary, even if it's done same day, those results can take upwards of a week, not including weekends. Our suggestion would be to discuss with the office what their policy is on delivering test results. Some offices will give you the information over the phone, while others require you to meet with the doctor to discuss the pathology report.

We're sorry for the worry that brings you here, but we're glad you've found us, and hope you find this to be a supportive and informative place. When you say you've had the genetic testing done, do you mean the BRCA test? And were you found to carry one of the mutations? Has your doctor said why they are not suggesting a biopsy at this point? With your familial history, it wouldn't be unheard of to have a biopsy if there were areas of concern. If you feel like this doctor isn't being as proactive as s/he should be, we suggest seeking a second opinion. As you know from watching your sisters battle this disease, time is of the essence. Perhaps it's time to find a doctor who you feel is being more aggressive with your care. Please keep us posted on, we'll be thinking of you! The Mods",

We know this information can certainly be overwhelming when you're first diagnosed, but we can promise you it will get easier. The more you learn about your diagnosis, the more things will start falling into place, and the better you'll feel about your treatment and recovery. It sounds as though you were diagnosed with Stage 0 Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS), does this sound correct? If so, this is a very treatable diagnosis! You can read more about DCIS here on the main Breastcancer.org site. And, you can chat with others about their experiences with this diagnosis on the DCIS forum. Start a thread there to introduce yourself, and you're sure to get great support! Also, it's understandable to have concerns about how your job will be affected by your diagnosis and treatment -- the Breast Cancer and Your Job section on the main site has lots of great advice on working during treatment, talking to your boss and co-workers about your diagnosis, and taking time off work for treatment. We look forward to hearing more from you soon, and supporting you throughout your diagnosis and treatment. --The Mods",

Your Gyno is only being extra careful and going to have you have a manual US by a technician to check the questionable area that is less than a centimeter area that the ABUS system saw but couldn't get the angle view that a manual operator can. This is not a reason to panic, it is just your Doctor being conscientious, which is far better than one who doesn't care. Please look at Breast Ultrasound May Help Younger Women Avoid Biopsies, also from our main site. You may have denser breast tissue due to your age (not a problem or bad thing) but Ultrasounds can get a view that mammograms can't in those breasts.We hope this helps, but try to settle, take a deep breath, and get control. We know that waiting is a terrible time, and no-one here will dispute that, but your results have not shown any obvious problems yet. Try to take it one day at a time. The Mods",

The cyst might have been a small infection, which could explain the swollen nodes, but also keep in mind, your lymphatic system is fairly sensitive, and they can swell for any number of reasons. We're guessing the doctor took several samples just to err on the side of caution, and not because he was concerned about malignancy. Try to focus on the positive for now, until your results come in, which will more than likely be benign, and then you can really relax! Please keep us posted! The Mods",

In the meantime, you may want to check out the main Breastcancer.org site's page on Paget's Disease of the Nipple. Also, you mentioned in your post you were also diagnosed with \"DC\", and in your diagnostic profile, you mention DCIS but at Stage IIB,which indicates an invasive cancer (DCIS is a non-invasive Stage 0 cancer). Did you mean to select IDC (invasive ductal carcinoma)? There's some good information on the main Breastcancer.org site on IDC as well. Also, there's a wonderful thread here for members currently undergoing chemotherapy at the same time as you -- make sure you stop in and say hi on the December 2017 Chemo thread, where you can compare experiences with others and support each other as you undergo treatment. We hope this helps and we look forward to hearing more from you soon! --The Mods ",

There are many breast conditions and most are not cancer related. However, any change to the breast should be checked by a physician. As you are experiencing significant pain, you should have it checked. Try to go when it is in a swollen state so that your Doctor can feel it properly and possibly order some tests to determine the cause as it may be something easily treated, once diagnosed. Also, for your piece of mind, you need it diagnosed. We wish you the best but please see a doctor. The Mods",

Most here would say that finding a lump and waiting for a definitive answer can be the most stressful time. Weekends are the worst time. We are hoping that you will get an answer quickly.

      "Content": "Nov 16, 2015 01:16PM - edited Dec 1, 2015 03:50PM by Moderators Hello All, We are interested in hearing your experiences on issues related to your diagnosis and/or treatment,such as sexual matters, weight gain/loss, chemo brain/chemo fog, bone and heart health, exercise and nutrition issues, menopausal concerns, lymphedema, infertility, neuropathy, joint pain, skin/hair changes, relationship changes, work and career hurdles, and emotional issues including fear of recurrence. Please don't feel that you need to address each of these issues. We are listing these as suggestions. Your stories will complement a new, upcoming section on the main Breastcancer.org site on Survivorship issues. Some things to think about for your story: Have you gained a new perspective on this other side of treatment? What life lessons have you learned? What advice would you give your newly-diagnosed self or other person just starting the journey? How does your \"old\" self compare to your \"new\" self? Is there a difference? What impact has your breast cancer diagnosis made on your life? If you've become a Breast Cancer Advocate, what is your mission and how are you fulfilling it? If you're willing to share your perspective of your life after diagnosis and treatment, or your life on active, maintenance or on-going treatment we'd love to hear from you! Please send your story via PM to the Mods along with a picture of yourself or something that represents you, and a note about how long since you've been diagnosed. Seeing these stories will surely inspire our new members, along with members just going through treatment now, to see that you CAN get through active treatment and get to a new normal on the other side, even if that includes maintenance or ongoing, lifelong treatment. Your story will be included with the other Members Stories photos on the main site (http://www.breastcancer.org/community/acknowledgin...), in our December Newsletter and may also be used in part throughout the website and/or in fundraising or event materials. Thank you for considering! --The Mods",

      "Content": "Jun 4, 2010 04:41PM - edited Jun 4, 2010 04:42PM by Moderators Hello Community Members,   We understand that managing the risk of lymphedema is a complicated issue. New information is always coming in, and for this reason, the Breastcancer.org Lymphedema section is prioritized for updates and is currently undergoing editorial revision.   It is true that there is a risk of developing lymphedema after undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy. The risk is low, but it still exists, and some women can and do develop lymphedema after having this surgery. It\u2019s also true that most women will never develop lymphedema after undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy. There are no absolutes. Each individual, together with her doctor, must use her best judgment about whether or not it is safe to engage in certain activities. It is widely accepted medical practice that blood draws and blood pressure measurements should not be performed on the affected arm. If there is no safer place on the body to receive blood draws and blood pressure measurements, then  you and your doctor can decide whether it is a safe and reasonable option to use the affected arm.   Lillie Shockney is a respected and valued member of the Breastcancer.org Professional Advisory Board. Different experts have different perspectives about the level of caution one needs to take when it comes to preventing the onset or worsening of lymphedema. There is no one consensus among professionals about how to manage the risk of lymphedema. Some experts believe that it\u2019s most important to err on the side of greatest caution in day-to-day activities. Others emphasize quality of life combined with using your best judgment from situation to situation.     It is not the role of Breastcancer.org to give individual medical advice. It is up to each patient to talk to her doctor about her unique risk for lymphedema.   We appreciate the respectful dialogue we've been able to have on this invaluable forum.     Warmest wishes from all of us,  The Breastcancer.org Team  ",

We know the side effects can be hard to manage, but try to assure you mom that many of them are temporary, and will lessen as her treatment continues.

Buy the best food Fresh fruit likes pears, apples, berries, bananas Dried fruits like prunes, dried apricots, raisins, figs Prune juice Nuts like almonds, pecans, and walnuts Lemons or limes to add to water Grains, cereal, and pasta with high fiber Unsweetened applesauce Fresh, high-fiber vegetables like carrots and broccoli Protein and iron-rich roods (nuts, fish, tofu, nut butters, meats) Crackers Sugar-free gum/candy/mints Tea -- all different flavors!  2. Get things for the kitchen Plastic or bamboo silverware Supplements: Some dieticians recommend Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 to combat bone loss Freezer storage containers so you can cook and freeze meals ahead Rubber gloves for washing 3. Hygiene Biotine oral wash (plus one in travel size) Unscented moisturizer (plus one in travel size) Sunscreen: Visit the EWG sunscreen guide Lip balm Hand sanitizer (plus one in travel size) Toothbrush sanitizer Packet of new toothbrushes Waterpik (in lieu of flossing) Pack of flushable moist wipes Squirt bottle for cleansing irritated skin/privates Tissue box and on-the-go tissue packs 4. Cleaning New or washed shower curtain liner Lint roller for pillow Disinfecting wipes (e.g. Clorox or Lysol) 5. Medications Artificial tears for dry eyes (Renew or Similasan) Immodium Acidophilus capsules for yeast infections Laxatives such as Colace, Miralax, or Senekot Pain reliever such as Tylenol or Ibuprofen Regular Claritin (for joint pain) Pepcid AC or Nexium reflux/indigestion Thermometer Blood pressure machine Ask your doctor about an anxiety medication Ask your doctor about a sleeping medication 6. Comfort Soft, seam-free hat for sleeping Satin or silk pillowcase Slippers Hair net Comfortable, stretchy pants, and cozy sweaters and shoes A wrap, pashmina, or blanket 7. Practical Tips Have a hair plan if you are going to lose it: Cold caps, wig, scarf. Consider getting your hair cut short before treatment. Discuss fertility preservation options with your doctor, if relevant. Get your teeth cleaned before treatment begins. Order a temporary handicap placard Talk with your employer ahead of time about time off, and Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) forms. Automate your bill-paying Consider organizing cleaning help Hire someone to help mow the lawn or take care of your garden. Start a blog or CaringBridge site to communicate and organize logistics Get thank you cards for the gifts and meals you may receive. Get a refillable water bottle for carrying around Gather plenty of good reading material Download movies onto a laptop or tablet Download favorite music and consider a meditation CD. Prepare a \"chemobag\": Assemble a small, portable, makeup-type bag that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: Digital thermometer, Tylenol or ibuprofen, toothbrush, toothpaste, breath mints, lip balm, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, sanitizer or hand wipes, saltines or animal crackers, tissues, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse, Maxi pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. Looking after yourself during chemotherapy Plan your infusion-day clothing well: should be comfortable and have elastic band. Exercise, or move around, every day to give you more energy and lift your mood. Moisturize whenever possible. After each shower, cover yourself in a high quality, paragon-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer from head to toe. Stay hydrated by drinking lots. Make it interesting by adding lemon or lime. Wear slippers around the house, especially if you have hard floors to prevent neuropathy. Forget about wearing heels during chemo! Sleep, rest, sleep, rest! Plan something special that you can look forward to after each chemo. Make a point to laugh and also to relax as much as possible. Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich food If getting infusions, download movies on your mobile device and don't forget your headphones! Infusion tips Some chemotherapy medications can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women may automatically have a port surgically installed. Others may be given the opportunity to use their veins with an IV. If you can use an IV, the goal is to keep your veins in good enough health that you can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to 'start low' on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt number 2, but she cannot go lower. If you're getting a port, the nurse may clean the port by injecting Heparin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heparin is injected. A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Nail care tips Some women swear by the OPI Nail Envy and Avoplex cuticle treatment set: http://www.amazon.com/Opi-Say-Hi-to-Fortify/dp/B00F6MNCGQ/ Use the Nail Envy as directed, and apply the Avoplex twice a day or more often if you can remember. Keep one bottle of the Avoplex, one at work, and one at home. Keep your nails very short to avoid snags and tears. If you are going to get a manicure or pedicure during chemo, you'll want to bring your own tools. Even if you are not, you should probably at least have your own nail clippers or scissors at home that you do not share. If your treatment will be turning your nails black (e.g. sometimes seen with Taxotere), then paint them a dark color before starting the treatment! Also ask about ice gloves that can help nails not turn black or fall off.",

Results from their clinical studies showed that all participants benefited from using the Theradome™ and experienced one or more of the following: A minimization and slowing down of hair loss; A doubling of hair follicle size for existing hair; New growth of healthy hair. It is costly ($895.00), but could be shared, or donated further to others. Our Theradome helmet has already been donated. But, we'll get it passed along. Sorry, wish we had more!

Like MelissaDallas said, it is possible for your lymph nodes to be suspicious and it not be cancer. There are a few things that would explain swollen lymph nodes, including a minor infection of some sort. We know it's hard not to worry and dissect every word that the radiologist said, but try to stay positive! It could be that they're just being extra vigilant because of your previous cancer.

While they don't grow at the same rate as a malignant mass, they can get bigger over time, which is why some doctors recommend having them removed. We know it's hard not to worry, but remember that most of these masses turn out to be benign. We're hoping this one does too!

To clarify, the BIRADS system is mainly used in the USA and some other countries, but certainly not all, so don't be concerned if you don't have a BIRADS, as it is only an indicative rating. Calcifications are very common, just there are different types. Nothing is sure, as stated above, until someone assesses a tissue sample and the surgeon may be required to obtain that sample. As we don't know your country and medical system, it is very dificult to advise you, but you can but take one step at a time, as each result can be the end or lead to other test. The feeling of not being in control is scary and most everyone on these forums know how you feel, and can empathise. Just take the tests one at a time as you may not need more that a mammogram and ultrasound! We hope so. If you are ordered a biopsy it still does not mean you have cancer until determined by pathology. We wish you the best The Mods",

The fact that you've had a mammogram and US in a breast clinic means a lot as they are very experienced in diagnosing problems. If they were at all unsure they would have ordered a biopsy, so you should be able to relax at that.  However, if you are not confident, you have a right to seek a second opinion. It is your body. It sounds as though your medical team is being responsive and acting properly to assess what they've found, and that's a great. Anyway, we recommend you to read the article What Mammograms Show: Calcifications, Cysts, Fibroadenomas, from our main site. It reinforces that there are many other benign masses, including some that are especially common among young women. Beware of general searches on the internet as there is a lot of poor and inaccurate info out there. Best wishes, The Mods",

It could be that the lump is benign, but they want to be sure to keep an eye on it and make sure it stays that way. Perhaps he suggested you come back in 3 months for a follow-up to check the size of the mass, not necessarily a biopsy, and the intent of his statement got jumbled? It was definitely a good idea to request your records and biopsy results, so you can look over those yourself. Also, when you return in 3 months, is it possible for you to bring someone you trust to help translate? Someone you can go over questions with beforehand so they know what you want asked, and nothing gets missed? Just a thought! Please keep us posted on how you're doing, we'll be thinking of you!

We know how concerning it can be, especially during pregnancy. We don't share or post pictures of breast cancer symptoms, because we don't want to encourage those with breast cancer concerns to use them as a diagnostic tool. That being said, symptoms like the one you've described progress very rapidly, often within days, and typically do not go unchanged for 5 weeks. Breast changes during pregnancy are very common, as are skin issues. It may be a good idea to have your rash looked at by a dermatologist, in addition to your regular doc! And if the rash changes in any way or you begin to notice other symptoms, bring it to your doctors attention as soon as possible. Please keep us posted on how it goes! The Mods",

Your description of only hearing bits and pieces of information sounds completely normal and how most here would describe the beginning days of learning they had breast cancer.

Just letting you know that this thread has been inactive since 2009 so you may not receive any responses to your post here. You can always create your own topic in this forum as you will likely get answers from other members by doing so. FYI: Eight out of 10 lumps that women feel in their breasts are benign (not cancerous). A benign lump can be a collection of normal or hyperactive breast gland cells, or it may be a water-filled sac (cyst). In any event, if you feel a lump and you're worried about it, DON'T HESITATE TO SEE A DOCTOR. By getting a doctor to check the lump you'll ease your fears. And if it's something serious, you can start getting treatment right away. The Mods.",

We are sorry that these changes in your 3D annual screening have brought you here but glad that you reached out. If you have more information from your mammogram you may want to look at this thread on Interpreting your results. Perhaps once you have your ultrasound results you can also review this thread for more clarity. Waiting for diagnostic tests can be very stessful. At the same time most of our members will advise you to not immediate jump to the worst conclusions. We are hoping for good results for you. The Mods",

You'll be in a fair amount of discomfort, you may be sent home with drains, and you'll have sutures and/or staples, and these all need to be minded carefully. You'll probably be advised to start light arm exercises after your surgery, but the no lifting rule is an important one following mastectomy and reconstruction. Getting family members and friends to pitch in will be key! As for how long recovery can take, that depends on the patient! Doctors usually say that you'll need around 8 weeks of recovery time following this type of surgery, but some people need less time, and some people need more. It's important to listen to your body and not overdo it. Follow the doctor's instructions on light exercise and stretching to maintain mobility during your recovery, get up and walking as soon as you feel comfortable, and get plenty of rest in the days after your surgery. Good luck on your surgery, we hope it goes well and that your recovery is quick! Please keep us posted! The Mods",

The Mods Hair loss occurs because chemotherapy targets all rapidly dividing cells\u2014healthy cells as well as cancer cells. Hair follicles, the structures in the skin filled with tiny blood vessels that make hair, are some of the fastest-growing cells in the body. If you're not in cancer treatment, your hair follicles divide every 23 to 72 hours. But as the chemo does its work against cancer cells, it also destroys hair cells. Within a few weeks of starting chemo, you may lose some or all of your hair. If you are having chemotherapy, your hair loss may be gradual or dramatic: clumps in your hairbrush, handfuls in the tub drain or on your pillow. Whichever way it happens, it's startling and depressing, and you'll need a lot of support during this time. Some chemotherapy drugs affect only the hair on your head. Others cause the loss of eyebrows and eyelashes, pubic hair, and hair on your legs, arms, or underarms. The extent of hair loss depends on which drugs or other treatments are used, and for how long. The various classes of chemotherapy drugs all produce different reactions. The timing of your treatments will also affect hair loss. Some types of chemotherapy are given weekly and in small doses, and this minimizes hair loss. Other treatments are scheduled every three to four weeks in higher doses, and may be more likely to cause more hair loss. Other types of breast cancer treatments may also cause hair loss. For example, Radiation only causes hair loss on the particular part of the body treated. If radiation is used to treat the breast, there is no hair loss on your head. But there might be loss of hair around the nipple, for women who have hair in that location. Radiation to the brain, used to treat metastatic cancer in the brain, usually causes complete hair loss on the head. Tamoxifen may cause some thinning of your hair, but not baldness. No matter how forewarned you are and how ready you think you are, it's always a terrible shock when your hair falls out.",

It's a lot to process, on top of being thrust into this world of cancer and treatment and surgery and a hundred other things that you probably hadn't thought twice of before your diagnosis. Just try to take it a day at a time, and don't think too far ahead. Focus on each day and what it brings. We have some links put together that many of our newly diagnosed members find helpful, a Breast Cancer 101, if you will.

Your friend is quite young and hopefully fit and we hope she recovers well from her BMx. People will need ton know more details on type of cancer to comment but each person's cancer tends to react to rads and chemo differently, so it is hard for people to comment at this early stage. We hope you can get your friend to read the BCO Resources and topics as knowledge is very useful as she goes through the 'process' of BC treatment. It is a very hard time and your friend is lucky to have a concerned friend to discuss this with. Talk to her as you may find she has a lot of information already.

While not cancerous, these lumps may grow. And any solid lump that's getting bigger is usually removed to make sure that it's not a cancer.

Sorry we're a little late jumping in here, but we wanted to hop in to provide some helpful links, starting with the main Breastcancer.org site's section on Chemotherapy, including info on what to expect with chemo, types of chemo meds, and side effect management. Also, the Treatment Side Effects section is a great resource for tips to help manage any side effects you may experience. There are some really helpful key threads here in the Chemo forum too! Great tips and practical advice on the following discussion board threads: Also, Last Month's Chemo thread might be informative! Hope you find this helpful! --Your Mods",

Lots of people wait for several weeks between their diagnosis and the start of their treatment or surgery, for a variety of reasons. It's not uncommon for 4-6 weeks to pass between diagnosis and surgery! It very likely will not have any impact on your cancer, but for added reassurance, we would suggest talking it over with your oncologist. We know how important it is to find a breast surgeon you are comfortable with, but if you feel as though the waiting period would be difficult for you to get through, calling around for a second opinion is a good idea!

We're sorry for the worry that you're experiencing, but we hope you find support here. A wait-and-see approach is very common with fibroadenomas. They are a common benign breast condition, and in most women, do not increase their chances of developing cancer later on. Many will stop growing, posing no risk to the woman. The issue with removing them is that tend to come back, and removing them every time they regrow can cause the breast to become misshapen. That being said, if it continues to grow, many doctors will opt to remove it, as it can become a source of discomfort if it gets too big. The follow-up is likely to check it's size, to make sure it's not growing at a rapid rate. If it is, your doctor will probably want to discuss other options at that point. We hope this helps ease some of your fears! The Mods",

You are certainly not alone as we regularly hear from those who are pregnant and dealing with breast changes and the anxiety that such can bring. It looks like you are taking all of the necessary precautions and following a path that will hopefully bring you some resolution and peace of mind. The only thing we might add is to work to move up the appointment with the breast specialist. While not necessarily a medical emergency it can be an emotional one as you want to decrease stress and worry during pregnancy as you are able. Perhaps you can put your name of a wait list for a sooner appointment. We are wishing you a benign result and a quick resolution. Keep us posted. The Mods",

Anyway we know how scary it can be even knowing that the vast majority of breast masses turn out to be benign, so while you wait for further tests to be done, it may ease your mind to read through the article What Mammograms Show: Calcifications, Cysts, Fibroadenomas, from the main Breastcancer.org site, that describes some of the benign results that can come from testing.

It is always a worry when you or your doctor find a change in your breast. Try not to jump to far ahead. While that is easier said than done, many lumps turn out to be other than cancer. It is very hard to wait for answers. Try to distract yourself in the meantime and may be stay away from researching too much until you know more. The Mods",

This is an interesting Topic as it is so important to discuss that time from first being told that 'C' word, when you almost go into shock. It is an incredibly emotional time as it bring your mortality to the fore and \"why me?\" is a big statement. It is OK to cry and probably healthy to do so as it releases some tension (to a small degree). If your husband, relatives and friends cry with you it is because they are worried about you too. We Mods get emotional reading your stories too. The interesting part that so many above have stated, is that it gets better. That is so important for newbies to read - it is statements by those who have been through this that mean so much. It is possible, that initially you have no control over anything but just having to wait for a progression of test results and appointments. Then, as stated above, once a treatment plan is developed and surgery you can start to regain some sort of control again and there is light at the end of the tunnel. We wish you all the best and always consider that all the people on this forum have been there too and are willing to help you through the process. The level of support you give each other here is so fantastic to see. The Mods",

We're so sorry for what your mom, and you, are going through, but we're glad you've joined us, and hope you find the support you need. There are a lot of really good responses here that we just want to echo. Chemotherapy has changed drastically in recent years, and many, many people are able to live relatively normally while undergoing treatment. Also, studies show that adding herceptin to to a chemo regimen can improve overall survival and disease-free survival: http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/hercepti.... We suggest having your mom write down all of the fears she has about chemo, and discuss them one by one with her chemo doc. We understand how watching her mother battle and succumb to cancer would be influential, but their cases are probably very different. It's important to confront those fears and learn more about then, rather than let them dictate her treatment plan. Please let us know if there is anything we can do, and keep us updated! We'll be thinking of you both. The Mods",

It can be difficult to discern the chances of the lump being cancerous or benign simply by ultrasound findings as it is used more so to complement other screening tests. If an abnormality is seen on mammography or felt by physical exam, ultrasound is the best way to find out if the abnormality is solid (such as a benign fibroadenoma or cancer) or fluid-filled (such as a benign cyst). It cannot determine whether a solid lump is cancerous, nor can it detect calcifications.without the doctors performing a biopsy, and so we would recommend trying to just take it one day at a time (easier said than done) until the biopsy is performed and the results come back.  We have attached some links which you may find helpful while you wait for others to respond.   ultrasound  BIRADS Core needle biopsy Please do let us know how it goes.  Warmest thoughts and wishes to you.

It sounds like the antibiotics have worked in treating whatever infection she may have had in her breast, which is a good thing! The lump may or may not even be related to whatever else was going on; many, many women have lumps in their breasts, and the vast majority of them turn out to be benign. It's possible she discovered it when she did because of the extra attention she was paying to her breasts, or it could've been related to her cycle. Either way, if she has a follow-up appointment schedule for a couple of weeks from now, and the lump remains unchanged, there doesn't seem to be a reason to go back sooner. She may want to call the doctor and let them know the lump remains, just to keep them in the loop. And remind her to keep a close eye on things, and inform her doctor of any changes she notices. Hope everything turns out to be fine! The Mods",

So the fact that these issues have been ongoing for weeks means it's unlikely to be IBC. It does seem like something is going on though, so it's good you were proactive and brought it up to your doctor! Try and stay relaxed, the odds are in your favor! The Mods",

Any change in your breast health/general health is worth bringing to your doctor's attention. You sound worried and so we also encourage you to talk to your parent or a supportive adult in your life who can help you to make your appointments and help to curb your fears. Sometimes visiting sites like ours or googling symptoms can make one more worried or anxious then necessary. Here is a link to information on our site about teenagers and breast health. There is additional information as well if you find it helpful. Remember if reading causes you to worry more than make sure to stop reading and researching and see your doctor first. The Mods ",

Swelling above the breast can be your lymph nodes and can indicate infection but your doctor's tests should have shown infectious reactions in your bloodwork. Now that you've felt a lump it would be best to see the doctor again and possibly get ultrasound and/or mamogram of your breast, just to be sure. It is most likely something minor but worth checking for your own piece of mind. So follow up with your Doctor again. We hope it all turns out to be nothing to be worried about.. The Mods",

We're sorry for the circumstances that bring you here, but we're glad you've found us, and hope you find the support and advice you need. It's always good to want to know as much as you can about your treatments. Have you discussed any of your concerns with your doctors? When they recommended radiation, did you ask why and how it would benefit you? It might be a good idea to start by writing down all the questions you have, as well as the concerns you have about side-effects and risks, and sit down with your medical team. They will want you to be as comfortable as possible going into treatment as well, so getting answers to your questions shouldn't be an issue. In the meantime, we have some information on our main site about radiation that you might find informative: http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/radiation. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us via the private message function. The Mods ",

Everyone here knows the agony and fear that builds while waiting for appointments or results. Some people keep themselves busy doing cupboard cleanouts (that they often have put off for years :-), working in their gardens or potting sheds, anything that keeps their mind and body active and engaged. Nothing will totally stop you worrying, but that is only natural and everyone here sympathizes with what you are going through. However, putting it off will only make it worse as it just extends it. Be strong and go to the appointment please, then you can find out. Different biopsies are required for different areas and different clinics may use varying techniques, so don't let what you saw on the report panic you. Remember that you have a greater chance of results being benign than otherwise - cling to that. We can only wish you the best, let you know you are in our thoughts and we are with you in spirit to help you be strong and follow through with the appointment. Regards, The Mods",

If the masses are on the bigger side, you could be looking at significant scarring, so definitely talk to the surgeon about how much s/he is planning on removing. The recovery will be dependent on how you typically handle surgical procedures, and how big the areas are that are being biopsied. Also, take into consideration you'll have additional recovery time if you undergo general anesthesia. You can read more about biopsy types and recovery periods on our main site: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types.... Good luck with your biopsies, we'll be thinking of you! The Mods",

Most of the tests have probably already been completed, on the tissue that was removed at biopsy (and lead to your diagnosis). If you have a copy of your pathology report, you'll see what was done and the result listed. You can learn more about some of those tests and what the results mean here: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis. If there is more info that your doctors need that isn't already on your path report, Armed with your pathology report, you'll sit down with your doctors at the breast specialist and come up with a treatment plan that works for you. Your first visit will be very informative, so write everything down, and write down any questions you have ahead of time.

You may also want to take a look at the Breast Cancer 101section from the main site, designed to help you sort through all of the information on our site, as some knowledge helps you understand what the results mean. However, remember that you have a good chance of it being benign, so try not to read too much from Dr Google as there is a lot of poor info on the internet. The waiting, most agree, is worse than the tests, so we sympathize. There doesn't seem to be much other than keeping busy, to help decrease the stress.

Have you been to a stylist who may be able to provide a different, or shorter hair style? Have you tried using hair accessories, like ties, clips, barrettes, or headbands? Some suggestions from this page www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-inform... Be gentle with your hair. Wash the hair on your head less frequently, using a mild protein shampoo twice a week and massage the scalp. A protein conditioner can be used to help add body to fine or limp hair. Use a soft hair brush and a hair dryer set on low heat or let hair dry naturally. Pat the hair dry rather than rub it. Avoid curling irons, straightening irons and hot rollers. Avoid perms, hair colour, bleach, peroxide, ammonia and lacquer during treatment. These products can contain chemicals that can irritate the scalp and damage the hair. Wear a soft cloth cap at night to catch hairs as they fall out. Use a satin pillow case as it is softer and smoother than other materials. Sorry you are having to deal with this!",

Hi everyone, We'd love your feedback as we're finishing up our hair loss management videos! These videos are intended to help women prepare for chemotherapy-related hair loss. They include submitted photos of our own community members. Since you are bit into it, and maybe even past it, we thought you could provide some good insights. These are still in the editing phase so they close to final, but not final yet. You'll notice a male voiceover on the \"How to manage chemotherapy hair loss\" video. This is a placeholder. A female voice will replace it in the final. The photos and text will scroll across the screen in the final rather than popping out. The information in these videos is intended to be a general introduction to preparing for and managing chemo-related hair loss. We will be adding web site content sections that go into much greater detail on wig, hat, head wrap, turban, and other options \u2013 much more than what we are able to convey in these short videos. Please know that Breastcancer.org also intends to create a video and other content addressing how to manage the loss of eyebrows and eyelashes; we are currently seeking funding for production. We very much value your opinions and feedback. Please post your feedback here, or us Mods! Questions for your feedback: Keeping in mind that the videos are intended to be a basic introduction, did you feel like any major piece of information was missing? If you've already had anxiety about losing your hair, did any part of these videos help to reduce that anxiety? If so, please describe what was helpful. Did any part of the videos cause you to feel anxious or increase existing anxiety about losing your hair? If so, please describe which part made you feel more anxious. Did the videos hold your attention for the full duration? Any additional comments?

We're sorry for the worries that bring you here, but we're glad you've found us, and hope you find this to be a place of support when you need it. Phenyxxfire, it's possible the doctor wants to see you back in 6 months to check the size of the cyst you're concerned about, to see how much it's grown and the rate at which it's growing. While cysts are usually benign, they can grow big enough to cause pain or misshaping of the breast, at which they could warrant surgical removal. He can probably tell from the ultrasound that it's benign (shape, edges, whether it's light or dark are a few indicators), but wants to see you sooner than your normal annual mammo to track it's size and/or growth. We totally understand how worrisome it can be though, so if you feel that a second op would be helpful, then definitely seek one out. Please keep us posted on how you're both doing! The Mods",

It's great that you're being so diligent about your breasts, and it's good to be aware of changes, etc. You should also mention your concerns to your mom and if it will make you feel better, discuss them with your doctor. Your doctor should give you peace of mind and reassure you that these aspects of your breasts are normal for you, and nothing to worry about. Please let us know what your mom and doctor say and try not to be too concerned until you've discussed your concerns. --The Mods",

It sounds as though your medical team is being a bit insensitive to your concerns. Anyway, we recommend you to read the article What Mammograms Show: Calcifications, Cysts, Fibroadenomas, from our main site. It reinforces that there are many other benign masses, including some that are especially common among young women. Also biopsies can leave scaring that makes scans more difficult later. Waiting is not easy but beware of general searches on the internet as there is a lot of poor and inaccurate info out there.  MelissaDallas has a point but if there are any further changes, don't hesitate to go back or seek another opiniomn. It is your body and your choice. Hi Eliz22, we hope meeting with BS sorts out your question and we hope, if a biopsy talken, that you find benign results. If you can take a friend to take notes if possible and give you support (hopefully not needed) as it is a very stressful time. Our thoughts are with you. The Mods",

We certainly understand your concern about the breast changes you're experiencing, it's a scary thing to go through! Like Whatnow said, what happens at your ultrasound will depend largely on what the ultrasound discovers, if anything. While many radiologists will speak with you about your results, regardless of what they show, some will not if the findings are positive (in a good way!). If you have questions, you can ask to speak with the radiologist, or you can schedule an immediate follow-up with your GP or GYNO and request that your u/s results be sent to their office.  Also, please keep in mind, IBC is very rare, making up only about 1-5% of all diagnosed cases of breast cancer. And at your age, with no history of breast cancer, the odds are even more in your favor. It's good that you're being proactive about your breast health, that's the best thing you can do at this, and any, age. Please keep us posted on your ultrasound and the results, you're in our thoughts! The Mods",

We know it can be stressful when you experience changes in your breast health, but like MelissaDallas said, it sounds like your ultrasound explained your symptoms, and we agree that you should talk to your doctor about some ways to help manage fibrocystic breasts. Also keep in mind that at 23, breast cancer would be very, very rare. At this point, monitoring and taking note of any changes, and then following up if you notice sudden changes or new symptoms appear, is likely your best course of action. Breasts change constantly as we grow, with many of those changes happening in our early 20's.

If you had chicken pox as a child and you\u2019re 50 or older, your age and your weakened immune system can put you at higher risk for shingles, a painful, blistering rash caused by the same virus that causes chicken pox. There is a shingles vaccine and in most cases it\u2019s better to get it before you start breast cancer treatment. If your immune system is weakened, you shouldn\u2019t get the vaccine until you\u2019re done with treatment and your immune system is at full strength again. If you had chicken pox as a child and are 50 or older, it\u2019s a good idea to ask your doctor if getting the shingles vaccine before you start breast cancer treatment makes sense for you. While shingles can still flare up even if you get the vaccine, the rash is usually less painful and less severe.\"",

You'e already had a flood of feedback, that will help with deciding to go single or double. Statistics are generally that you should have no more chance of recurrence than you did of your first Dx, however there are psychological and physical considerations as well to consider - are your breasts large or small, how will you cope with your mammo after the first surgery (it can be very stressful).  Are you considering recon or going flat? You could read the Reconstruction stories and options on BCO and ask questions. You may consider not reconstructing and going flat, so read Living Without Reconstruction After a Mastectomy There are many issues to consider and many variables in all treatments depending upon location, surgeon, your body's responses and your Dx. We understand that it is confusing, often overwhelming and there is so much information to read and consider but there is no easy way as YOU have to make the decision as to what is done to YOUR BODY. Sorry we can't help more. You are best talking with the other members. Waiting is a hard time but can be well spent in educating yourself on the options for treatment. All the best The Mods",

You also have a long wait that doesn't make it easier. You could read the Reconstruction stories and options on BCO and ask your question there. Please rephrase and don't double post (same post in multiple Topics). We hope you can gain lots of valuable info on pre and post surgery along with your reduction. Your surgeon may be concerned with doing both surgeries at once and the physical limitations resulting during recovery. Often just having someone who understands can help and we're sure someone will soon comment. We wish you the best. The Mods",

Clinical studies with over 750,000 women have proven 3D MAMMOGRAPHYTM exams are more effective versus traditional 2D mammography exams at detecting invasive breast cancers, as well as reducing callbacks.1,2 This means an earlier diagnosis for some women, while reducing the stress and anxiety for others.1,3 Yet, many women don't know about these more accurate mammograms, and even more won't have access to them until breast screening centers offer them.1* Hologic, the makers of the GeniusTM 3D MAMMOGRAPHYTM exam, approached Breastcancer.org to help raise awareness about the availability of this clinically proven technology. They want to encourage women to get involved and let their breast screening centers know that they want this technology accessible to them and the other women in their lives. If you agree, you can get involved. Here's how: Visit MyGenius3D.com and find out if your facility has this advanced technology by typing in your ZIP code. If your facility doesn't, let them know you want them to offer it. The site includes each facility's contact information. You can also post here to raise your voice... even if your facility has it. In support of our work at Breastcancer.org, Hologic will be donating $10,000. Thank you on behalf of all the women who deserve this!

They can help you get an appointment with a doctor or nurse practitioner. You can feel proud of yourself for taking your health concerns seriously. Take a look here for additional resources: Important Resources for Teens. Please limit your posts to ONE of the following forums: Not Diagnosed But Worried https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/83 Waiting for Test Results https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/62 Benign Breast Conditions https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/148 High Risk for Breast Cancer https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/4 Review the currently listed topics in the forum of your choice from the above. Someone may have already asked a question similar to yours, and received answers that would fit your situation. A great place to start is this thread, which covers frequently asked questions about interpreting imaging results, common symptoms or unusual breast activity. Please see For ALL Not Diagnosed Newbies: Imaging & Common Symptoms FAQs for more information. In the forums, look for topics with recent activity or you may also start a new topic, if you're not finding the answers you're seeking. Introduce yourself as a new member and post your question. Refrain from posting the same question in multiple topics. Allow some time for members to respond before posting again in a different thread. If you have not received responses in a timely manner or if you are confused or concerned about the responses you receive and need help please send a PM to the Moderators for assistance: https://community.breastcancer.org/member/56097/message We hope that you do not receive a breast cancer diagnosis. Since we are a breast cancer organization, it is only appropriate and in your best interest to remain on our boards long-term if you receive a breast cancer diagnosis, or as needed during times of concern (e.g. further testing). If you have been routinely and repeatedly told by your doctor and/or a second opinion doctor that your concerns about breast cancer are unfounded due to testing results, repeating your concerns on these discussion boards will not change your status, and likely will frustrate members who have already offered help and advice. If you think you may have a health-anxiety issue, we strongly suggest you share your concerns with your doctor and ask for help minimizing your anxiety. Below you will find links and information on our main Breastcancer.org site for those who have not been diagnosed with breast cancer but may be worried: Benign Breast Conditions, for lots of information on signs and symptoms of benign issues. \u2022Understanding Breast Cancer, to help define what breast cancer is. \u2022Symptoms of Breast Cancer, for information about what to look for. \u2022Breast Cancer Risk and Risk Factors; great info on how to determine your risk level and things you can do to help lower your risk. \u2022Screening and Testing for information on types of breast cancer tests and what they show. \u2022Managing Breast Cancer Fears, for info on calming your fears and getting the information you need. \u2022Understanding Breast Imaging and Database System (BI-RADS) \u2022Worried About Lump in Breast - http://www.breastcancer.org/questions/lump - Eight out of 10 lumps that women may feel in their breasts are benign (not cancerous). A benign lump can be a collection of normal or hyperactive breast gland cells, or it may be a water-filled sac (cyst). - In any event, if you feel a lump and you're worried about it, DON'T HESITATE TO SEE A DOCTOR. By getting a doctor to check the lump you'll ease your fears. And if it's something serious, you can start getting treatment right away. - One way to make lumps less frightening is to get to know what your breasts normally feel like. There's no better way to find out than by doing your monthly breast self-exam. The upper, outer area\u2014near your armpit\u2014tends to have the most prominent lumps and bumps. The lower half of your breast can feel like a sandy or pebbly beach. The area under the nipple can feel like a collection of large grains. Another part might feel like a lumpy bowl of oatmeal. - If you notice any changes in your breasts that last over a full month's cycle or that seem to get worse or more obvious over time, tell your doctor. Knowing how your breasts usually look and feel may also help you avoid needless biopsies. \u2022Test Results and Medical Records, including what to do when you get your test results and how to keep track of your records In addition, there are also important Discussion Board threads for those not diagnosed but worried, where you can find and ask for advice from others who are where you are, or from those who have been there: \u2022Does Breast Cancer Hurt - honest truth from bc patients \u2022Breast Cancer Symptoms - a comprehensive list from those w/bc \u2022Anxiety - https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/83/topics/855477?page=1 Check out, Know the Facts About Breast Cancer: A Video By Breastcancer.org President and Founder, Dr. Marisa Weiss (https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/83/topics...)

Odds are in your favor that this is a benign condition. Women's breasts change constantly, and it's not uncommon for these changes to come on suddenly. Sometimes, if your breasts are too dense to get a good mammo, then a doctor will request an MRI, so it's possible that while the gynecologist wanted better pictures, the breast specialist was able to discern enough from the mammo to rule anything serious out. We definitely suggest following up with the office though, and if you feel like there is any doubt and need to be reassured that you are in good health, then certainly talk to your doctor about an MRI, just to be on the safe side. We know it's scary to have unresolved questions about your health, we hope you get the answers you're looking for from the doctor! The Mods",

We're so sorry for what your mom and family are going through, we know the first days and weeks after a diagnosis can be so very hard. What type of surgery is she having? During her meeting with the oncologist, they'll most likely go over the surgery and her recovery, and then lay out a treatment plan based on what was found during the biopsy. This is where she'll learn what sort of treatment she'll be undergoing, like chemotherapy, radiation, or both. Once you have that information, coupled with the specifics of her diagnosis, you'll have a better idea of what you're dealing with. You can also contact other doctors for second opinions, if that is an option, and something you feel is necessary. Is it possible for someone to be with her while she's meeting with the oncologist? So that any questions she or anyone else has don't get forgotten, and she feels more comfortable with what's being discussed. Please keep us posted on how her surgery goes! In the mean time, you may find it helpful to connect with some of the members on our caregivers forum, for support and advice: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/16. The Mods",

Scar tissue from your prior surgery may show up. Please read What Mammograms Show: Calcifications, Cysts, Fibroadenomas. and Keeping an Eye on Benign Breast Lumps is Safe Alternative to ... from the main Breastcancer.org website where you will read that scans without invasive biopsies can often be the most appropriate treatment. Also look at Breast Ultrasound May Help Younger Women Avoid Biopsies, also from our main site.

It's a very personal decision, and your wife should consider all her options and find the one that works best for her and your lifestyle. You mention not being 100% on the surgery - what are your reasons for being unsure? It's certainly a big decision, and it wouldn't hurt to get a second or third opinion. It's hard to compare recoveries and results, as everyone's body and diagnosis is different. But perhaps speaking with another surgeon to get a different perspective could be helpful!

      "Content": "Nov 9, 2015 10:25AM - edited Dec 1, 2015 02:52PM by Moderators Hello All 6+'ers ! We are interested in hearing your experiences on issues related to your diagnosis and/or treatment,such as sexual matters, weight gain/loss, chemo brain/chemo fog, bone and heart health, exercise and nutrition issues, menopausal concerns, lymphedema, infertility, neuropathy, joint pain, skin/hair changes, relationship changes, work and career hurdles, and emotional issues including fear of recurrence. Please don't feel that you need to address each of these issues. We are listing these as suggestions. Your stories will complement a new, upcoming section on the main Breastcancer.org site on Survivorship issues. Some things to think about for your story: Have you gained a new perspective on this other side of treatment? What life lessons have you learned? What advice would you give your newly-diagnosed self or other person just starting the journey? How does your \"old\" self compare to your \"new\" self? Is there a difference? What impact has your breast cancer diagnosis made on your life? If you've become a Breast Cancer Advocate, what is your mission and how are you fulfilling it? If you're willing to share your perspective of your life after diagnosis and treatment, or your life on active, maintenance or on-going treatment we'd love to hear from you! Please send your story via PM to the Mods along with a picture of yourself or something that represents you, and a note about how long since you've been diagnosed. Seeing these stories will surely inspire our new members, along with members just going through treatment now, to see that you CAN get through active treatment and get to a new normal on the other side, even if that includes maintenance or ongoing, lifelong treatment. Your story will be included with the other Members Stories photos on the main site (http://www.breastcancer.org/community/acknowledgin...), in our December Newsletter and may also be used in part throughout the website and/or in fundraising or event materials. Thank you for considering! --The Mods",

Stage IV is no different. We have added a specific caveat to the description of the Stage IV forum per request of several members (including non Stage IV members). We ask that that people please respect that this forum is for Stage IV members only or those posting on behalf of a Stage IV patient. There is a separate forum for Stage IV Caregivers/Family in \"Support and Community Connections\u201d. We have NOT made this forum private for the reasons stated earlier that we do not want to add any additional barriers for women and men needing information and support. However, we do agree that the needs of Stage IV women and men ARE unique, and it can cause an additional level of stress when non-stage IV members post their worries or questions on these topics. We can all read, and learn from one another. If someone wants to give a special hug, or supportive word of encouragement, this is always welcomed. Otherwise, the needs and feelings of the various groups are truly unique and thrive well with compassion and understanding.  Every day our members are using common sense and respect in selecting where and what they post: e.g. Seventy year old members are not posting and commenting in the 30 year old forums; Those who receive strength and guidance from spiritual/religious threads, are not necessarily posting in the atheist thread; Those with Stage IV are not necessarily posting in the Stage I forum (and vise versa). If you have additional comments or suggestions, please PM us, the mods, or post in the comments thread.  And due to the overly negative tone, the emotionally-draining nature of this topic, and per request of the original poster, we are locking this thread.  Thanks for your understanding.  The Mods ",

First, we did not remove the post without contacting LuAnn. This is the private message that we sent to LuAnn: \"Hi, I'm really sorry to have to say this, but you are unfortunately not allowed to raise funds publicly on breastcancer.org, even though it is for a charitable cause. We think that you are very kind and loving to want to do this for a Angela, however, it does not abide with our Community Rules. Maybe this is something that you could do privately. I sincerely regret that I have to remove the thread, and hope that you understand the reasoning. Warm wishes, Melissa\" Our community rules and site rules have been developed over time, with much thought, experience, and assistance. The specific Rule that we are referencing is: You agree not to solicit anyone to buy or sell products or services, or to make donations of any kind, without our express written approval. This rule was developed to protect our Community from potentially false fund-raising requests -- (e.g. requests for someone's treatment, etc., who end up NOT being real). We know that LuAnn's request is authentic, however it may encourage more such similar ventures from others--- some which may end up not being honest. So, by making an exception here, it leads to us being inundated for other such requests. Because of this, and for your convenience, we DO allow links to third party sites: breastcancer.org allows links to web sites operated by persons or entities other than Breastcancer.org. Breastcancer.org specifically disclaims responsibility for materials posted or activities that occur on linked sites. This allows you, as members, to do such fund-raising without breastcancer.org having to be directly associated with your choices. On another, yet related note, we receive ongoing (and heart-breaking) requests to help women who are not able to receive their treatments due to a lack of monetary funds/insurance. If we could possibly fulfill these requests we would! We have carefully written our mission statement with the help our Board of Directors, Professional Advisory Board and Consumer Advisory Board. Specifically, our mission is to help women and their loved ones make sense of the complex medical and personal information about breast cancer, so they can make the best decisions for their lives. With this mission statement, we raise our funds, and the awareness and respect of our site. So many people and groups give of their time, money, and effort to make the wonderful programs at breastcancer.org possible. We thank everyone who has contributed to our mission and programs and to those who continue to support our fantastic growth and development. breastcancer.org is placed at risk of losing this support, and possibly even at legal risk by associating ourselves with fund-raising outside of our mission statement. We receive thank you notes from thousands of people who we have helped with our programs \u2013 even claiming to have \u201csaved\u201d their lives. We do not want this threatened, or our reputation to be questioned. Breastcancer.org is designed to be a homepage for a thriving community concerned about breast cancer, and a comfortable place for visitors to find emotional support and share experiences. Your love and kindness and generosity toward Angela and her family is beautiful. We encourage this, but ask you for your understanding as to our goal of protecting the site that hundreds, and even thousands, have worked so hard to carefully develop and nurture, and for those who depend on its survival. We hope that this helps you to understand and to accept our moderation decisions. With respect, Melissa and Tami",

It sounds as though your medical team is being responsive and acting properly to assess what they've found, and that's a great. Anyway, we recommend you to read the article What Mammograms Show: Calcifications, Cysts, Fibroadenomas, from our main site. It reinforces that there are many other benign masses, including some that are especially common among young women. Please understand that a BIRADS Score is a USA system to provide one way for all radiologists to categorize their findings and create a follow-up action plan. It is simply a guide to future testing (if any) required from results, so far. It is NOT a diagnosis and should not be considered as such. The only definitive diagnosis is by biopsy. Various scans show a variety of different tissue features, and can usually determine if a biopsy is warranted Waiting is not easy but beware of general searches on the internet as there is a lot of poor and inaccurate info out there.

Also, you should have a numerical list at the bottom of each thread that lists the number of pages -- you can click back a few pages at a time to find more recent posts, click the first button to go back to the beginning of a thread, or slowly click back through chunks of pages to reach a certain time in the middle. Currently, we don't have a super easy way to jump to a particular page in the  middle of a thread, BUT, you can jump to any page in a thread by editing the url in the browser line at the top of your page -- just click the url once, scroll to the end of the address, and you'll see a \"Page=\" with the number of the page you're currently on. Stick any old number in there and press enter and you'll jump to that page in the thread. We're working on an easier way to take care of this, but in the  mean time we hope this helps! --The Mods",

You'll find many other relevant topics under Living Without Reconstruction After a Mastectomy that may interest you to read and post to as well as your own topic. \"Dog Ears\" can be not only unsightly, but uncomfortable too. If not possible to achieve first time around, they can be rectified by simple surgery later. We are sure others will give their experiences and insights on your question. Your surgeon should be willing to do as you ask, provided you are informed of all aspects. On this forum you will be able to gain the required information to make a correct decision for you. It is your body and YOUR choice. If you are not happy with your surgeon's attitude, we hope you are able to seek another surgeon who understands your point of view. We read too often of members who have had surgery only to find the surgeon decided to allow for a later reconstruction with skin sparing (leaving a saggy chest) rather than the expected neat flat chest they expected. You need to be firm - to the point of having your surgeon sign an agreement to do as requested, or go to another surgeon. We hope you find the answers and responses to help in your decision process. All the best The Mods",

Imagining the worst, losing sleep and visiting sites like ours and others to find answers can produce much distress. We are sorry that you haven't heard from our members here but we are sure that there are many who have been in your shoes. Try as best you can to distract yourself from the worry. Try to not turn to Dr. Google and know that you are following through with the best course by planning to consult with your medical team for more advice and hopefully answers that will offer you relief. Keep us posted on what you learn. The Mods",

Click here to find it on our site http://www.breastcancer.org/community/acknowledgin... or read below: We are sending gentle hugs to her husband and beautiful boys.  Save as Favorite  \"My name is Allison and I am 32 years old. I was diagnosed on October 1st, 2013 with breast cancer at the age of 31. We found out a couple weeks later that I am stage 4 with my cancer being spread to the bone. I am also triple-negative. I have 2 kids and am married. \"In June of 2013 I noticed a swollen lymph node under my right armpit. I went to my new family doctor and she told me it was probably nothing and more than likely caused by a virus such as a cold and would go away in a couple weeks. I went back several weeks later because it felt to me like it had gotten bigger. She again told me it was nothing but suggested perhaps I had a bacterial infection and gave me a course of broad based antibiotics. When I went back again in the middle of August because I felt the swollen lymph node had gotten bigger, and said I was concerned about lymphoma, she suggested I had high levels of anxiety and needed to see a counselor. She wrote me an order for a second round of antibiotics just in case I had a lingering infection of some kind. Finally, I mentioned the cyst on my ovary from the year before and how I was supposed to follow up to make sure it had resolved. At that point she finally agreed to send me for a CAT scan from the neck down. The CAT scan showed both the swollen lymph node of 2 cm and a complicated cyst on my ovary, bigger than the year before. The radiologist suggested a mammogram for the lymph node and follow up with a gynecologist for the ovarian cyst. Although my Dr. said I did not need the mammogram, she went ahead and ordered one because of the recommendation of the radiologist. This screening mammogram came back clean...or negative. \"In September, I went back to my family doctor again and insisted that we do further testing for the lymph node. It was bigger and I knew something was wrong. Every instinct I had was telling me something was seriously wrong. She again told me I needed counseling but I insisted on a referral to a hematology oncologist for a second opinion. She sighed and gave me the referral. The oncologist felt the lymph node and started asking me questions, and told me I needed an immediate ultrasound. He called up the breast center and told them that I needed to be seen that day for the scan and within a hour I was at the breast center getting an ultrasound. It was September 26th. During the ultrasound they found the lymph node, as well as a small mass that was deep and high in my breast, right next to the lymph node axillary tail. They placed some markers on me and did an immediate diagnostic mammogram which also showed the mass seen on the ultrasound. I was scheduled for the first appointment they had available for a biopsy, September 30th. On October 1st, I got the phone call that changed my life forever, informing me that I had breast cancer and the lymph node showed cancer cells as well. Within a few days we also knew that the cancer was triple-negative and very aggressive at the highest grade of 3. \"Additional tests and scans that I once again had to push and argue for, showed that the cancer was probably already spread past my breasts and lymph nodes into my bones. My femur on the left, another bone in my leg on the right, my pelvic bone, and spine. A biopsy of the pelvic bone confirmed this and I was officially diagnosed with Stage 4, Grade 3, triple-negative breast cancer. On October 31st, I received my first dose of chemotherapy. Today my cancer is steady (has not progressed) and I continue my chemo treatments. \"I like to sing the song, 'Roar!' by Katy Perry as my theme song...for I am a tiger and I will roar against the cancer.\" --Freedomchild82 (Allison), diagnosed at age 31",

Check out the myths about breasts and breast health, particularly as they relate to uneven breasts during puberty. Hopefully this information will help to not worry so much. It is always a good idea to talk to a parent or trusted adult about any health concerns you have and in fact it is always a good idea to bring your worries to your primary health care provider for information and ways to protect your health.

Take the survey now >> In summary, we have already had 168 respondents to the survey. While most recognize find it important to discuss detection and \u201cprevention\u201d, the month of October appears to evoke primarily negative emotions: anxious, annoyed, angry, sad, frustrated, overwhelmed, excluded to name a few. Overall, respondents wish that there was more of a take home message and education around all the pink and survivorship: what is going on in the research, what could one actively do to prevent/reduce chances, sharing of more stories of MEN and women already experiencing breast cancer, more than one day acknowledging MBC, more clarity on where the money is going. Too much sexualization, silliness, impudent phrases and activities, and commercialization that do not seriously enough represent the seriousness of disease, feelings and experience. There is a concern that the pink and fundraising around it in October is going too much toward awareness, and not enough toward research and help in general for those who have already been diagnosed. There are many comments also discussing if \u201cprevention\u201d really exists, and resentment around that word. ",

You can read about Family History as a Risk Factor on the main Breastcancer.org site. If there is a first-degree family history, your family may consider Genetic Testing to see who may be at risk. If you're concerned about lowering your daughter's -- or your own -- normal risk of breast cancer, you may be interested in checking out the Lower Your Risk section, which includes Dr. Marisa Weiss's Think Pink, Live Green column, and tips for Organic Living.

They're not unheard of for women who have ongoing benign breast issues, but as you mentioned, getting the surgery approved and covered by insurance becomes an issue without medical necessity. It's a very personal decision, and one you obviously haven't come to lightly. The most important consideration is that you're doing what is best for you and your situation, although it's important to remember that a mastectomy doesn't fully eliminate your risk (women who have recurring fibroadenomas often have them in both breasts). We have some info on our main site about prophylactic mastectomies, and how to decide if it's the right course of action: http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/prop.... We hope this helps!

We, like all who are here, honestly wish AR the very best health, and hope that she uses her celebrity status for the benefit of all --- from early detection to the massive and ongoing struggles of individuals with advanced status.  P.S. Edited to add that we did make some slight edits to various member posts and topic title to get rid of defamatory comments. ",

The chances of your lump being anything but benign are very slim, as you're very young and breast cancer in young women is relatively rare. We know it's concerning to have any changes in your breast, but you've done the right thing by seeing your doctor and bringing up this concern.

You may want to write down your concerns in advance of meeting with your oncologist and take someone to your appointment as it can be difficult to take everything in in the beginning. You also may want to reach out on the forum Young with Breast Cancer as there are a number of topics there for young people and young people with children.

In fact, most breast cancers are NOT inherited, so if you're concerned about your risk of breast cancer, you may also want to check out the Lower Your Risk section of Breastcancer.org, or the new site powered by Breastcancer.org called Breasthealth.org.

We're sorry for the worry that brings you here, but we're glad you've found our community. Given your young age, the odds that you have cancer are very, very low. More likely, you're dealing with some kind of infection related to nursing or all the changes your breasts have undergone following your pregnancy. However, only a doctor can accurately diagnose your condition, so we urge you to speak with your OB tomorrow and discuss your concerns with her. At least for your own peace of mind! We know it's hard not to worry, but remember that the majority of breast issues turn out to be benign. Talk to your doctor tomorrow, and hopefully she can help ease some of your fears.
