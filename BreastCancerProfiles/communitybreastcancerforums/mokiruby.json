    "Content": "mokiruby wrote: Hello, I'm 30 years old and currently 30 weeks pregnant. For the past 2 months I have had this really intense pain in my right breast usually after eating. The pain brings a tear to my eye and lasts for about an hour or 2 before it settles down. I decided to mention it to a Dr. She then sent me off for an ultrasound. The ultrasound has come back and the right breast (the one with the pain) came back clear but in the left breast they found a small solid lesion. The ultrasound tech said it's probably fibroadenoma but need a biopsy to be sure. I have booked that appointment and earliest I can get in is in another week. I've been feeling sick with the not knowing, and struggling to eat and sleep. I have 2 young children and every now and then I have to go off to the bathroom to have a cry so they don't see me like this. I'm scared. My aunt died from breast cancer. I know it's possible it could be nothing. I've also just noticed that my left nipple is in... I'm not sure what an inverted nipple looks like so not sure if that's what it is.. it's just not sticking out like the right as much and is leaking a clear white fluid. The right side is not leaking at all... Log in to post a reply",
