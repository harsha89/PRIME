Have come to believe mammogram isn't the way to go for dense breasts. Anyway that ultrasound revealed what they called a complex nodule right breast with somewhat irregular margins, radiologist said \"wider than high\" ,probable benign ,then, and showed left breast nodule 5 mm, probable benign and 2 \" prominent axillary lymph nodes , largest 14 mm\" , overall said probable benign on everything repeat in 6 months. So I did, repeated both in Aug 2017, mammo abnormal, ultrasoundnoted a \" new nodule right breast somewhat irregular , hyoechic, and reportedly left breast nodule had gone fro my 5 to 24 mmm but \"wasn't certain the 2 techs were looking a thing same lesion, \"which I thought was strange for radiologist to write. This lead to MRI which said BiRad category 2, benign findings.I thought this was strange,not convinced all was well,and went to an breast specialist surgeon, who said the films were of poor quality (done at a free standing facility that does imaging) and I needed to repeat at a hospital associated facility she trusted. She also said \" I would have said the left breast was lit posteriorally, , on MRI, but radiologist didn't say that in report. Repeat mammo benign, showed nothing of course, ultrasound showed the irregularly shaped 7x6x5 mm lesion with irregular margin and a \"tail\" ( which I've gathered tails are Ok on animals, not nodules), with no vascular flow to lesion, and a probable benign intrmammary lymph node on right, they didn't recommend workout of that . This ultrasound did not see the lesion on left breast which had been reported on other facility report.Now I have to have a ultrasound guided core biopsy of the irregularly shaped nodule on right breast. Sorry so long. I am very scared, but it will be better to know what's going on. Sorry such a long post. That's my story. i will talk with my primary and Gyno about not referring people to the first imaging facility due to the poor quality of their imaging and reports, I could see the difference as a lay person when they put the older ultrasound next to newer ones. So waiting to see what happens. Wondering about \"the tail\" and \" no vascular flow within the lesion\"statements, will see breast specialist surgeon after needle biopsy. Log in to post a reply",

I do like the Breast surgeon, after biopsy, if treatment indicated, will get 2nd opinion as well. The BiRad 2 was given by first place with unclear poor quality film.most recent ultrasound says supsicious without a BiRad number, I guess it's actually 4? So that's where I'm at. Unfortunately have to meet an out of pocket of $3000 ( that shouldn't take long unfortunately before the PPO kicks in for 80/20. Coverage. I hit the wrong box when making selection it looks like. I'll update after biopsy I guess",
