Especially since there is a tie between breast and ovarian cancer. My aunt had ovarian cancer at 29 and then breast cancer later. Same with my grandma. She died in her 30's from breast and ovarian cancer.",

Maybe it's just that it's comforting to know others have been through what I fear most and they are here to help. I am humbled by that.  I am 28 years old and was adopted so I didn't know my famiy history. 2 years ago I found a small lump in my breast and told a doctor and he said not to worry about it since I was so young. Now 2 years later (almost three) I moved and have a new doctor. While doing a routine physical she found the lump and asked how long it had been there. I told her the story and she sent me for a mammogram and ultrasound. I did both and got called back for a fine needle biopsy. A chain or cluster of complext cysts around the hard nodule were aspirated and came back B9. It was recommend that I have a core needle biopsy since the hard nodule couldn't be aspirated. And that is what I did yesterday. The sugeon was concerned because it was \"taller than wide\". (although yesterday on the screen it looked much wider than tall\") Now I wait. I have a follow up on the 15th and will get the results then. As to my family history.....I was able to get in contact with a biological relative and found out that on my dads side three generations of women have had breast and ovarian cancer.  Thank you all for the time you take to help those of us in the waiting period.  Log in to post a reply",

I have a followup ultrasound on the 18th to see if they have grown or shrunk since the last ultrasound a few weeks ago. I had to cancel my gyno appts and just keep the ultrasound appointment. I felt so overwhelmed between the breast lump and then the two on the ovaries. Too many appointments. It's easier for me to do one at a time. Because the breast lump has some malignant characteristics to it, I decided to tackle it first. ",

I did the bloodwork for it but it just depends on if I fit the criteria for the insurance to cover it. He did mention the possibility of a fibroadenoma and that is what I am hoping and praying for. Either way God's got it and I can rest in that ",
