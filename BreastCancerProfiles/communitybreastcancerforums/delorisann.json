I had my six month pet scan which came back great. my bone scan came back and needed to go in for xray on femur bone, will get results to that next wednesday, then had my mammogram and they called and want me to go back in for an ultrasound. I had BC in the left breast 19 years ago and now I am scared it is back. I had BC in the right breast 9 years ago and it is clear they said.. I am just scared now that it has come back. the waiting is horrible but I dread finding out. I have been blessed with added years and I am selfish and want more. I just needed to talk to somone I guess and would like to start coming on the board and meet you wonderful ladies . I am curious as how the pet scan that is supposed to be so great could miss something in the breast, anyone know?  I will be back for sure",

I am just not one that posts a lot or talks a lot, I moslty just listen and read. tonight, my heart goes out to you. I know how  scarey this is but guess what? You are definitly not alone, My goodness I wish I had as many friends online as you do. I  guess in order for that to happen, I need to get on here and meet everyone. Anyway, my friends in the chat room call me Del.. those ladies are graet and have helped me in so many ways. I know you have lots of prayers going up and I dont think one more can hurt , so just know i am going to add you to my prayer list and pray that the Lord will give you peace and the reports will come back good. I can tell you are loved and cared for. You are one lucky lady in that aspect. I pray that the test come back with something other than cancer.. We need to pounce on Cancer and Pray that God will just help man  find a cure fast. It is already too late for some but the rest of us are still breathing and where there is breath there is life and where there is life there is hope... Love, You sister in the Lord.. Deloris",

We will continue to pray for her, God is still in control and still in the miracle making business, I know because he gave me a miracle for the third time. Just keep up the prayers and if God does not heal her here it is because maybe he needs another angel in Heaven. Hugs to you all Delorisann",

Just want you to know I am so thankful to have met you and want you to know I miss you. I have you in my prayers and I pray that God will give you a miracle. When I was fighting so hard from my cancer, I kept singing a song I sing with my band. it is called Miracle in the Making. God gave me my miracle, in fact he has come thru for me three times. I praise the Lord for my healing and I pray that you get yours too. Thers a miracle in the making, one just for you , the father is working even nowYour prayers have been heard and the answer is on the way.Theres a miracle in the making for you today.  I was told that if God didnt give me my miracle while on earth, I would get it in Heaven. I think he has more work for me to do here on earth, because he healed me once again. I will be praying for your miracle also.. Dear Heavenly Father, I bring my sister Dawn before you tonight. I ask that you wrap your loving arms around her and give her peace and comfort.Lord you know what tommorow holds and we do not, but I pray that her family can draw strength from you and she can  also. Lord I pray that you find it in your will to let her continue to be here for her family. Please Lord, I pray that you help us find a cure for this horrid disease. We have too many sisters that are suffering so and sometimes we wonder why this is happening. Maybe we dont have faith enough, I dont know but I do know that you said if we had the faith of a grain of mustard seed we could move mountains. I think all the sisters in this group could muster up enough faith to move a mountain if we had to. I am asking you Lord.. Hold her hand tight thru all this pain and suffereing and help her find some calmness and comfort. We love you Lord and praise you thru the good times and the bad. Amen.",
