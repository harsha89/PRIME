I had a small red spot just next to the nipple and every so often it would itch or get some scaling. Then it would disappear, but would come back sometimes in a several week period. It was only on one breast which is why I questioned it with my breast surgeon and internist. Both kept saying that  because I had just had a lumpectomy and radiation for the second DCIS in my right breast that it was just dermatitis. They recommended different creams and lotions to try and it would work for a couple of days or a week and the \"spot\" would appear again. That was in 2003. The breast surgeon was going to do the punch biopsy in his office that Sept. The day that I went in for the biopsy there was nothing there! However, it came back again and would become irritated. They kept telling me that Paget's doesn't come and go, but I knew with that \"gut feeling\" that we sometimes get that something wasn't right. One of the main things being that it was only the one breast. Finally after much nagging from me my BS sent me to a dermatologist who did the punch biopsy and as Tender said it was a little thing with no pain. The first thing he said was that because it was only on one breast that would be his \"first\" reason for doing a biopsy. It came back positive for Paget's. Luckily, there was no underlying invasive tumor but more DCIS for the third time in 10 years in the same breast!. The oncologist recommended  a mastecomy with immediate reconstruction which is what I did in Nov. 2004. I don't want to frighten you, but had I not been aggressive who knows what would have been the out come if I had let it go. I am now 3 1/2 years NED. Hopefully, yours will be nothing, but you need the peace of mind to know for sure what you are dealing with. Please don't put off getting the biopsy as there is nothing to it. Praying for benign results for you. Rose",

Tell your doctor that you are uncomfortable with what you have been told and ask him to do the biopsy or recommend a dermatologist to look at it. Lots of Hugs and will be thinking about you and praying for a good and speedy resolution to your problem. Rose",

      "Content": "Nov 2, 2008 12:05PM - edited Nov 2, 2008 12:06PM by Rande Hi Alli, I was diagnosed with Paget's in Sept 2004. I did not have an invasive underlying tumor, but I did have my third bout of DCIS in the same breast. The Paget's symptoms first started to show just before I was diagnosed with my second DCIS in 2002. I had a lumpectomy for the DCIS followed by 6 weeks of rads. The Paget's was just a small red spot that itch occasionally. It was just next to my nipple. Somehow it survived the radiation and would come and go for the next two years. My doctors didn't think it was Paget's because it would go away and then come back so thet treated it as dermatitis. They were going to do a biopsy in Sept of 2003 and on the day of the biopsy there was no sign of it even under magnification! But, of course, it did come back and I was very lucky that there was no underlying invasive tumor. They removed the nipple Oct 2004 and found the DCIS. They had gotten all of the Paget's with the removal of the nipple, but because this was the third DCIS in the same breast in 10 years the oncologist and my breast surgeon recommended a mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. I had that done in November of 2004. I pray that your sister does well.",

I had lumpectomy with rads in 2002-03. I did not want to risk an implant and really did not want to go that route. I wanted to use my own body tissue. It is a very major surgery as the others have posted and I was 69 years old at the time. I found the results to be very natural and the bonus of a flat tummy was a plus. I also had the left breast reduced to match. I will say that the recovery was very long. I healed well but did have a hernia which was repaired during the revision and nipple reconstruction the following Oct. I still have abdominal wall weakness in one area and if I overdo I have periods of swelling and discomfort. I don't know if my age played a part in this and also the fact that I also have Irrlitable Bowel Syndrome which causes bloating and discomfort. In truth I was very uncomfortable for the first several months, but I know many women that did not have this same problem. The DIEP flap and Muscle sparing TRAM was not available where I live and I did not want to travel for the surgery. If these options are available to you I would certainly look into them.",
