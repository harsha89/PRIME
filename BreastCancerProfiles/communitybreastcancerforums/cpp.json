I have tried to join some discussions, but feel as if there are established friendships here and I am intruding. Just don't fit in. So, I thought I'd start a new discussion and make some new friendships with others who have been recently diagnosed. We are just starting on this journey and we can travel together. I have my surgery scheduled for Aug. 10th. Bilateral mastectomy w/ reconstruction. (expanders) I had to quit smoking before they would do the surgery...thats why I have a wait. Today marks 1 week that I have been smoke free ...it has been a struggle, but I can't say it's been horrible. I think because I have a huge motivation...my surgery. I have to get to work, but hope to meet some new people and make some new friendships! Have a good day! Log in to post a reply",
