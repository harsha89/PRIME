Like I have nothing in the tank to keep myself even halfway positive during the RADS. I used it all up in chemo and dealing with the mastectomy. It's been almost 8 months since my diagnosis. This feels like it's never going to end. The worst part about it is that I don't think it ever does. Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day",

Nothing major but just really really red like a sunburn and REALLY itchy. So much so that they called in a prescription strength cortisone cream. It itches the most around my collarbone and in between my boobs. Under my arm is equally as red but not itchy but I think that's only because I am numb under there from the mastectomy. On a positive note I feel like this has gone by relatively quickly so for those of you just starting try not to obsess about how long it's going to be. Just go and try and go about your day as normally as possible and it will go by fastðŸ˜Š And just as a side note from previous conversations I read above...I am laying on my back for treatments with both arms over my head with the mold for my arms and a bolster under my knees.i wear a gown that opens in the front. My techs open the gown and immediatiy lay a small towel over my girls while the line up my tatoosand then remove the towel and close gown during treatments.",

I finished chemo in sept, had a double mastectomy in October and thought I was done besides my continuing Herceptin treatments until my MO wanted me to just talk to an RO to be safe. Apparently I am in the gray area so to be safe I'm going forward with the RADS. I'm not happy and definitely scared. Mostly of the late SE. I have mapping Thursday and have my first treatment (of 28) on jan 12th.",

I keep telling myself once I do the first one and get the ball rolling I can stop analyzing the situation and just get on with it. I too want to do everything I can to prevent this from coming back but I'm afraid of the SE's. I already had reconstruction and have implants in place. I'm worried what is going to happen with that. I'm even more terrified of developing another cancer as a result of the RADS. I know it's supposedly a low risk but after having cancer once I'm not willing to accept increased risks of any kind of cancer. I just hate this whole situation",

Getting a little more tan under my right arm but that's all. I guess there is some fatigue but mainly from the drive which is 50min one way. But I have 3 kids (6,4, and 2) so I'm always tired so it's hard to tell what is from the cancer crap. CassieCat- I like you had a complete pathological response to chemo and had clear margins after a mastectomy. Thought I could avoid RaDs but alas I am here. My team thought there was some benefit in it for me along with the idea that I am young (35) so they wanted to be aggressive. Welcome to all of the new members of the group. I stressed MAJORLY in the days leading up to RADs but once you get through the first one and just get into the groove it's not so bad. You can do it!!",
