I had originally planned to replace the implant on the BC side because of all the information stating that rads and scar tissue, skin and breast tissue dont do well together, But as luck would have it, the valve broke so during my re-excision they took out the old  and placed a tissue expander in. My implandt was a 350cc they replace with a 400cc TC filled to 200  and at this point it is big. We are not filling it any more because we really dont want to do any more stretching than we have to. Which is good because i really dont want any more tension on the scars than needed. And you also hve to worry about capsular contracture  which is still a possiblily with the TE because the scar tissue is forming around it know .. I wont start my rads unil the end of May or beginin of June. Just had my latest surgery last week and I have to heal... But I would think if you had mastectomy withut radiation and your implants dont fail  during surgery they would stay in. Unless you want to go bigger, then they might do a TE until you heal and then put new implants in,  I just dont know. Talk with your BS and see what he says about it... he might recommend you to a PS he or she works with to get their opion.",

I don't feel that most microcalcifiations  become  cancer.  Most of them are not associated with cancer in any way shape or form  They can be from  previous injury, aging or just part of  breast changes that some women experience   And some are associated with cancer. They can usually but not always tell by the mammogram.. sometime it is a little hard to make out the difference between the two so,  its watch and wait or you go for biopsy to find out. As for my right side, no I am not worried with the calcification's I do have have this point,  they have been there for many years and haven't changed.. But it would unrealistic to say I don't wonder about any new ones that might show up in the future. I will cross that bridge when I come to it. Wasn't offered the mastectomy,  Mine was located in just one area and was handled by the two surgeries I did have,.But there are many other factors to consider in making that choice .. I hope you get the answers your looking for  and that your calicifications are classifed as nothing to worry about!...((HUGS)). ",

Having implants does obscure some of the angles and make it a little harder to interpret.. but from my experience having implants does not make it any more difficult to find lumps.",
