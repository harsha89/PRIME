      "Content": "Mcquis01 wrote: Hi! I had a vacuum core biopsy completed for a Tumor found on my screening mammogram and then followed up by ultrasound which recommended a biopsy be completed due to Birad 4 classification. The biopsy came back as a benign intraductal Papilloma and was referred to a surgeon. The surgeon said it had to be removed and the biopsy is really inconclusive due to the small amount of tissue biopsied and could potentially still be found malignant. I had a lumpectomy today on my right breast. Has anyone had experience with this as well? Log in to post a reply",
