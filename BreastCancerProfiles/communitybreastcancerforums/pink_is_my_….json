I assume that's because of having IDC and finding it in the lymph nodes. I could have opted for the mastectomy but decided on the lumpectomy simply because the recovery was easier. Also in my case the three lumps I had on the left side were all in a row so as the surgeon said it will be like taking a piece of the pie out. I don't regret my decision. Ii think it comes down to peace of mind. Good luck going forward. Make sure you put your diagnosis in your profile.",

She said to start using Glaxal now. Seems a bit odd but wondering if anyone else did any prep work before hand. I don't expect to start radiation until the earliest late October as chemo won't be finished until end of September. Fingers crossed that everything will be on schedule. I don't see an RO until mid September but want to be prepared ahead of time as I too have fair skin and sensitive to burning Am already using Medederma on my scars to soften them up.

Hopefully by the end of October I'll be able to start. I had my first mapping done on Sept 18. My follow up was Oct 6, seven days after the last chemo. Almost fell off the table because I was so weak in the muscles. Proud of myself for making it in there. All three tattoos are done, can barely see them, didn't hurt. Simulation is complete, just waiting on a phone to say when I start. When I met with my RO she had never heard of green tea. But then she also had no clue as to which vitamins were antioxidants. She doesn't want me taking any Vitamin E or C. She told me I could use anything I want before, or after my treatments, including deodorant except for Vitamin E. Seems odd with everything I've read here. I'm getting both sides radiated and lymph nodes on left side. Only 20 treatments. RO said new studies indicate that anything over 16 is overkill. But she's not comfortable with only 16 so she's giving me 20. I'll take that 20! I've been practicing holding my breath for 20 seconds and so far doing okay holding it for 30 or more. It's so strange how everyone's RO has different ideas and the way things are done. Now it's hurry up and wait!",

They don't tell you this at the time but if you do some research you'll find it does affect the immune system for the rest of our lives. My friend has had shingles twice now since she had chemo over 35 years ago. Did she get it because of chemo? I don't think there's enough research being done on long term side effects to know if that's the reason. When you read up about shingles they say chemo treatments can lower your resistance. Life seems to be so much about how we balance it. Kim Possible: This time around I didn't suck on any candy at at all. Too busy talking to the nurse. (DH had his head phones on and was listening to the radio.) But yes my taste buds this time are a bit off. Not sure if if no candy or mints makes the difference. During the first time I definitely felt a weird taste during treatment but not this time so I didn't feel I needed the candy. Will have to go back to the candy next time, see if that makes the difference. HapB: I take a lot of your wisdom to heart. I listen because you've been through this before. Thank you for you input. There where times during my first round that I really didn't think I could make it for five more. But then I started to feel a bit better and decided no matter what I can do this. Each of us is different in how we find the strength to move on. I pray that you find yours. Of the two things in life that I've gone through, chemo is way easier than losing a husband. Emotional scars are much harder to heal for me than the physical ones. One thing I learned from it, is that I'm more loved than I imagined or thought I was. Learning to love ourselves is the hardest.

I guess it will depend on how I'm feeling overall as well. I might also try some iron pills to see if that will at least keep it steady. Mostly I feel tired and bit unsteady on my feet at times. On the bright side at least all the pain I had from the Neulasta shot last go round raised my WBC 3 points higher than it was before I started chemo. But they still want me to take the shot again this time. The nurse did give me some pain meds to help with the bone and muscle pain. Opiads, woo hoo! Maybe I'll take extra doses of Tylenol or Aleve this time and sell the opiads on the black market. Just kidding. But I certainly won't be taking all 40 pills she prescribed. So .... We noticed they had switched my original time schedule from Friday to Saturday late Thursday night when we were looking to see what the time was suppose to be for Friday. I'm suppose to take my premeds starting the day before chemo so naturally I started on Thursday. Now, I'm short on premeds. I'm robbing from my next treatment schedule and will have to get a couple extra pills prescribed for my last chemo. This is the second time they've switched times on me without telling me. I think they had done the same thing to others because the guy next to me today had showed up yesterday but was also switched to today.

So far I've used only my right arm because of lymph node removal on the left side. However, the nurse last time said they may have to use the left arm for the next two infusions. The only other option is feet and that limits your mobility. The vein they used for my first infusion back in June has finally stopped hurting. Not that it hurts a lot but when I run my hand along it, it was pretty sensitive. I have chording in the one vein that they used for my second infusion. Nothing from the third and fourth infusions. I think that may have something to do with how good the nurse was in finding good veins. Nurse said to use hot moist compresses to help with the chording. Good luck!",

What little peach fuzz is left I expect will fall out when I start my Docetaxel in three weeks. 😔 Oh well I will grow back 🙂 I really thought I'd be okay with being bald but turns out not so much. This cancer is tricky business, plays on your emotions, you beliefs. For those wondering about second treatment side effects. Everyone is different but my experience was way more fatigue and more nausea which wasn't really from the chemo but all the other drugs they give you to counteract the side effects. My nausea was from alternating diarrhea and constipation. But of course they gave me more drugs for that which has its own new side effects. Will be glad when this is all over. Next chemo will be a new chemo drug so new side effects to start all over with. Life is good! Hang tough, it is doable, one day at a time",

The only way I knew my temperature was up was by taking it. But they drill it into you to go to emerge right away with a temperature over 38 for over an hour as a precaution. After that first time I decided that if I felt okay otherwise I'd just wait and see. Most of the time it came back down if I took off my clothes and laid under the fan. Tylenol helped as well. For the first five days I had muscle and joint pain but it eased up after that. Just keep moving! The first round was the worst, after that I knew what to expect and knew what to do.

Summer's going to be gone soon. Had a long chat with both my nurses about cold caps and whether they really work to prevent hair loss. They're not available here in Canada so there's not a lot of information to go by. They did have one lady who paid thousands to have one shipped here from California. In the end the lady lost her hair anyway. They both said in all the years they've only ever had one lady that took over a year to get a full head of hair back. They were really worried that she would be one of the few people with permanent hair loss. My peach fuzz on top is actually growing. Now how do you manage that? There's barely anything to cut. Reminds me of babies hair. However, the both nurses recommended using ice chips in your mouth during infusion of Flourourcil. I tried it today for the first time but both previous treatments I didn't have any problems with mouth sores. Who really knows if it works or not! So far it does seem to be helping with taste issues. I also sucked on Werthers hard candy and excel breath mints today through the infusions which I forgot to do last time. Don't know if that's why last chemo I had such taste issues. This is the first chemo session where I came home and went straight to sleep for six hours. Usually it's like the energizer bunny. The nurses also recommended I dip my fingers and toes in ice chips for the next session of Docetaxel in August to prevent any numbing or tingling after infusion. Will be so glad when this is all over with! ",

I still think the whole thing is a big guess on their part. I know there's a formula that they use and probably base a lot of it on statistics but really it's anybody's guess as to whether it will come back. Why did we get it? I don't know. It's not from being stressed or eating the wrong things or doing the wrong things. I know lots of people who's lifestyles are so bad but they don't have cancer. I do know that this has changed me in ways I never imagined. Some good, some not so good. I don't want cancer to define me but it is also a part of me now. Stay healthy! We're almost there.",

I overheard one of the nurses yesterday talking to a patient about a pic line but it has never been offered to me. Probably because I'm only getting six rounds of infusions total. Not sure really. I did ask the nurse one time but they basically said they prefer to use veins and they're pretty good and finding them. But with only two more to go I'm sure they can find a couple good veins left somewhere. They only thing is that those veins are pretty sore and will take at least three to six months to repair. The vein from my second infusion has some cording in it. The very first vein they used has now started to heal and that's from mid June. It just takes time. Vivian, where are you from. Sounds like Canada? T-Sue, would like to but with all the smoke coming in from Washington and BC it might be too smoky to see the sun. And I don't think we get the full effect here. I heard we only get 65% of the eclipse. It is exciting to see though. I've seen some before. (Yes, I'm that old!) With all the smoke lately I have to stay inside because it's reeking havoc on my eyes and nose. Where's Kim???? Tiny bit of tingling in my feet last night for about an hour but has disappeared today.

Susie: When they told me at my last treatment that my RBC was getting too low I started a high dose 1200 mcg of B12 right away. Also ate a few more steaks than normal and bbq some more burgers. Also eating one egg a day and added spinach to my diet. Not sure if that's what made the difference but my trip to the ER determined that my RBC are holding their own for now. You could also try iron pills but I took one and ended up with some pretty nasty stomach aches for a couple of days. I don't think chemo and iron pills go together. Think positive and tell your bone marrow to make more RBC. I hope it improves or holds its own. Having a blood transfusion will make you fell better or so I was told but no something I'd want to add to my list of side effects. Hope your treatment goes well. Everyone have a great weekend.

I have a friend who sends me a card every two weeks. When I thanked her she said: \" I can't help myself.\" Those little words of encouragement help out tremendously. Especially on those days when I'm crying my eyes out wondering how this all happened. What I've also learned is that once you're finished chemo people seem to think you return to normal immediately. They don't seem to understand that there's still side effects to deal with and time needed to recover. That time is not one week but months of recovery. Medical professionals have no clue what chemo is about. When the radiation dept called me Monday to book my next follow-up appointment she wanted to book it for yesterday. I said, I highly doubt I'll be dancing into your dept on that day since I just finished chemo on Sat. The next alternative was today. It's like she didn't even hear that I'd just finished chemo three days before. I sometimes wish they could all take just one chemo treatment to see what it's like! I now move like a hundred year old arthritic lady. Things hurt that I didn't know could hurt. Amazes me just how much poop can come out of one person! What is that sewer taste in my mouth from? Walking up the stairs is a major ordeal that requires a half hour of rest at the top of the stairs. In fact any activity requires a half hour of rest afterwards. Will my nose ever stop running? People think I'm crying because my eyes are constantly watering and running down my face. Kim: my nails hurt like the dickens. There's weird looking bumps and bruising going on. Nothing has fallen off yet. The nurse told me it can take up to 2 months before your nose stops running. I swear I've been through at least ten boxes of kleenex. Recently had to go to Costco to stock up again. I find Benadryl seems to help dry things up a little. I put Vaseline in my nose every night before bed. Not sure if that's what helping but the bleeding nose has stopped. Hap: you're so wise! Thanks for your words of wisdom. Ladies, hang in there. There is a an end in sight.

You never know what cells may have broken away from the tumour and taken up residence elsewhere. The chemo will have destroyed those nasty rogue cells. The good news is that it's not in your lymph nodes. The chemo side effects will eventually go away. I'm four weeks PFC and each day it does get better. But, it is a slow process. This whole cancer train is a slow process.  I went for what I thought was going to be my first radiation treatment today. Turns out it was only to make calculations, measurements, take x-rays, and put sharpie marker all over. I thought that's what the last two visits were for. Tomorrow will be my first official treatment. Because I'm being radiated on both sides and lymph nodes on the left I'll have to keep my arms in the upright position for at least 25 - 30 minutes. Ouch!!! Even today by the last five minutes it was really starting to hurt in the shoulders and arms. After the set up was done I went to visit the physiotherapy dept to see about getting some exercises to help ease the soreness. I still have muscle weakness in the morning but most of the other side effects from the chemo are slowing going away except for the runny nose and watery eyes. The muscle weakness usually takes most of the day to disappear. I now have a tiny bit of chording going on in my armpit likely from the chemo. I also have it in my arm where they did all the infusions. Oh my gosh, some days I feel so old. Energy levels are coming back. I get up with great intentions then my sore muscles tell me to slow down. Taste buds are back 90% but there's still some things that taste odd. Sugar seems to be bitter.",

We're all a little lopsided in one way or another. I had a choice between Tamoxifen or Letrozole for my hormone therapy. She read the lengthy list of side effects for Tamoxifen and the very short list for Letrozole. I chose Letrozole. I figure I have had enough side effects for one lifetime, thank you very much. One of the side effects is hot flushes which I already have and I guess this means they'll get worse. Lucky for me I have snow drifts to jump into or in the summer the frozen food aisle. Another is bone, muscle and joint paint which I also already have. Not ready for a scooter just yet. Not sure how expensive Tamoxifen is but Letrozole is pretty high and it's not covered by health insurance here. Somewhere around $100 for 30 pills. The only way I can get it for free is through the cancer clinic. They have some program they use to get it for free. This cancer business is expensive when you add up all the little incidentals, like OTC drugs, lotions, hats, scarves, and stuff that isn't covered by insurance, etc. Nurse practitioner said I'll probably lose my thumbnails. What!!! I don't think so. They don't look that bad. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. She also said that fatigue can sometimes take up to two years to get over. WHAT!!! Funny how they add these little things in after the chemo is finished and not before. Asked her how long it takes for eye lashes and eye brows to come in. She said she'd never been asked that before and had no idea. Huh! Really, not one person is 12 years ever wanted to know that??? Am I the only person who wants to know that? Can't believe how fast the radiation is going. By the end of next week I'll be half way through treatments. Be glad when this is all over. Then I can go back to my rainbows and unicorn life and put this tropical storm behind me.",

Julia: Thanks for the \"heads up\". My biggest issue with wigs is there's usually way too much hair. I'm not a big hair person. I've had straight, limp, fine hair my whole life. I tried getting a perm one time and well, let's just say it wasn't a good look on me. I have a couple of those pre-tied scarves that I wear around the house. If I go out, it's pretty cold here, I pull my hood over the scarf for extra warmth. The problem I have with my hair is that it's pure white so it's kind of hard to see if anything is happening up there. There's is a tiny bit of fuzz going on left over from the last chemo. It'll be interesting to see how all the hair comes back in especially for eyebrows and eyelashes.",

With that said who knows if I would have developed any of those side effects but I really didn't want to risk it. Like Hap said my personal medical history told me no to Tamoxifen. Too many red flags for me. The only side effects that concerned me with Letrozole were bone loss and high cholesterol. I'm already on medication for high cholesterol and will have family doctor keep an eye on that one. Generally, my bone density has always been excellent and yearly testing will determine if there is any and they can make adjustments for that. Both of those side effects seemed more manageable to me.",

Started the Tylenol for the headache as soon as I got home and have taken Zantac for the heartburn right from the start. Last time I could barely swallow the heartburn was so bad. By the time we figure out what to do with all the side effects the chemo will be over. My leg and armpit hair have seemed to stop growing. Strange because I was told the only hair that would fall out would be head, eye lashes and eyebrows. I only have little wisps of hair left on my head which I expect will soon fall out. Still have the eyelashes but then I've never really had great lashes to begin with. If they fall out I probably wouldn't notice. I sure don't envy you girls that have treatments for six months to a year. You'll be in my prayers and thoughts for sure each night. I find it difficult to remember to be careful with bacteria and germs because even though the WBC is low I don't feel any different. It's the simplest things I do every day without even thinking. Now I find myself having to be more careful about the silliest things. My chemo instructions were to get out, don't isolate yourself but be careful.

The pain in my left foot started about a month after radiation was finished. No pain prior to chemo. It was bad enough that I really wanted to cut off my foot. I decided to take some prescription naproxyn that I had left over from a few years back. Worked like a charm! Now I can walk and exercise again. When I had my recent follow up last week I asked about the pain. She said it could be left over from the chemo, or the arthritis is now acting up, or the Letrozole, or a combination of all of them. She did say that it will take more time for the side effects of the chemo to disappear for sure. I do find that the Naproxyn (over the counter is Aleve) works very well for the muscle and joint pain but it also helps with inflammation from arthritis.

Since I'm only doing three infusions and I didn't have any issues with the FEC that I'd probably be okay with the Docetaxel. If I do develop any negative side effects then next infusion I can always start the ice. Also I was suppose to be taking double my dose of steroids for the past two days but misread the directions. I guess I didn't need it because I didn't have any reactions during or after. She did top off the steroid before the infusion. No side effects so far. But it is early! On the bright side she did manage to find one more workable vein so I didn't have to pee in the chair. She said it didn't matter the because chair is vinyl and they'd just wipe it up. Had a good laugh at that and then I said wouldn't be so good for me if I had to go home with a wet bottom. But next time I guess they'll have to use the left side where I had the lymph nodes removed. Nurse said studies have shown that if I haven't developed lymphodema that it likely wouldn't affect it. It's either that side or they find one in the leg and then I'll wear a diaper. Ha ha. Not! Once all these steroids where off in three days I'll be back to crying for two days. Taste buds already starting to disappear. Fun times! Only two more chemos left to get.

The surgeon said that it doesn't matter if you have a mastectomy or lumpectomy the chance of recurrence is the same. Not sure why that is because if you don't have a breast than how can it recur unless it metastasizes elsewhere. In my case I also had it in 2 out of 6 lymph nodes on the left side which meant it had already spread beyond the breast. I still chose lumpectomy because recovery was easier. I'm older (66) and am taking my chances that by the time it decides to come back I'll die from other causes. Probably from the side effects of chemo and radiation. If it does come back before then well I don't think I'll be doing chemo again. Only you can decide what to do Peachy. Everyone's case is different. Everyone's reasons for their decision is personal. You'll know when the time comes what you want to do. I was lucky that all my tumours were in a row about 1/4 inch apart so they could do a lumpectomy and still leave enough tissue to make it look normal. As the surgeon put it \"it'll be like taking a piece out of the pie.\" With a bra on you can't tell any difference. HapB: That's what the RO said.",

Nothing that lasts anywhere from a few seconds to a dull ache for part of the day, then it's gone. Occasionally the odd jolt like you said of a nerve ending repairing itself. When I had my RO meeting on Monday she did an exam and I noticed the next day things felt a little sore. Funny when she asked me if I felt any lumps. They couldn't feel any of the three lumps before I had surgery. Not sure why she thought if there were any that she could feel them. They'd have to be pretty big! Now with the scars it's hard to tell what's a lump or scar tissue. I saw my MO once out of the five sessions and that's only because my count was lower than she wanted. As she told me when I first met her that I would not be meeting with her again unless I was a \"trouble maker\". All the other times it's the Nurse Practitioner. I prefer the nurse because she has more of a personality and will answer any questions. Actually she seems to know more. Our temperatures the past two days are already down to the 40s during the day. Yesterday we had big fluffy snow flakes falling. I'll trade you Kim for those 80s. Next week we're suppose to be going up to the 60s. Paulette: Don't worry about spots. Focus on healing yourself right now. I think one of hardest things going forward will be any ache or pain will seem like it's the return of cancer.",

It contradicts the study that came out saying that staying on the hormone therapy drugs longer than five years doesn't make any difference. What to believe? I started my Letrozole two weeks ago and for the most part the side effects are starting to disappear. I still have a bit of muscle soreness but I think that's also left over from the chemo. Only 7 more radiation treatments to go. So far, I only have two very tiny blisters that have developed within the past two days. The techs were quite surprised I haven't had more reactions as I have fair and sensitive skin. I followed HapB's advice with no lotions, soaps, or deodorants. No real fatigue to speak of and I'm a little more tired than I was at the start of rads but nothing compared to chemo fatigue. I met a gal the other day coming out of radiation whose last chemo was Sept 19 and she had at least an inch of hair growth all over with one bald patch left at the front. Huh! I'm still as bald as they go except for leftover peach fuzz which my hair dresser shaved off the other day. Now, I'm really shiny bald. It was a little sad to see it go since I've been nurturing all that peach fuzz along for two months hoping that it would grow into something. Oh well! Glad to see everyone is coming to an end with chemo. When I told the nurse practitioner that I'd never do that again, she said it's like having a baby, you forget the pain after awhile. Uh huh!

The Cross Cancer Institute is one of the best in north america. God works in mysterious ways. Turns out he was right on with this cancer diagnosis for me. He has a plan for you as well. Kim: I went on Letrozole over five weeks ago and so far no problems. The first couple of weeks I had some muscle and joint pains but not sure if that was left overs from the chemo. As far as the hot flashes go, I haven't noticed a real difference. Maybe a few extra in the night but mostly tolerable. Throw the covers off, put them back on, one foot out then take it back in, turn up the ceiling fan, turn down the ceiling fan. I've found lately that if I don't wear a head cover I have less flashes in the night. Ladies: While putting on eye shadow this morning I took a look and woot! woot! eyelashes are coming in. When I looked on the weekend there was nothing, now there's at least 1/8 of an inch. Leg hair coming in strong, no armpit hair, yeah. Mustache and beard looking good, no, just kidding! Although those pesky chin hairs are back! I also noticed some facial peach fuzz growing along the sides. I did have a little before but maybe I just don't remember how much? Head hair is coming in, slowly and because it's white and fine barely noticeable. But it is there. If I look at an angle I can see fine eyebrow hairs coming in.",

Could be the same, could be worse. Hmmm. Let's be positive and expect the same. Positive thoughts and no side effects for everyone this week. ",

She said she likes it to be 1.5 but she figures by Sat it should be up. Fingers crossed. Been feeling really crappy and nauseous the past two days. Apparently you can over do it on those days when you feel great. I guess I just didn't realize how this chemo can really affect you. There are days when I asked myself if this is all really happening and that maybe it's just a bad dream. I find lately I have a lot less patience sometimes. The other day I was going through the self check at the grocery store and the guy next to me kept putting his groceries in my bagging area. Of course then my checkout comes up and says remove the last item from the bagging area and scan it. I thought I was going to have to kill him. I finally lost it and told him to quit putting his groceries in my bagging area. So not like me to lose my patience like that. Lilsuzq: I'm a strong believer in acupuncture for myself. Some people respond well to it, others not. I'm one of those who responds better to acupuncture than physio therapy. Once I'm finished with all this chemo and radiation I'll be going for a few sessions. Good thoughts Ladies!",

This time around I've had no indigestion, hiccups, or nausea. They told me I should have taken the Zantac every day and not just when I felt indigestion. Lesson learned!

Julia so sorry about your Dad. I use to do pet therapy in the nursing homes every week. It's very difficult for them when they first move in. One lady I visited was so confused and depressed. She kept telling me about how lonely she was. I always made an extra effort to spend more time with her. After a couple of months she started to adjust and made some new friends. It's just takes time. Tralph I had my last AC three weeks ago and I'll be starting my Docetaxel (taxotere) this Friday with any luck. With luck you won't experience any side effects. I know I'm nervous about the first treatment. Kim how was your mini vacation? Susie, HapB, and MsLIn: Years ago I went on a celiac diet to help with digestion and food allergy issues I was having at the time. It was a challenge. That was thirty years ago and there wasn't much known about celiac. There's so much more awareness out there now for celiac and many more options to choose from. Our intestinal health is very important to our overall health. I went to Look Good Feel Better yesterday. It was good fun. I'm not sure I look much better but I did feel good about all the products you get. Our group received earrings as well. I got to talking to the woman beside me. By the time they figured out she had Leukemia they had given her one week to live. They immediately started her on Chemo and found that her brother was an exact match for a stem cell transplant. She then spent 90 days in hospital while her WBC came back to normal. Amazing! It was encouraging to hear that she is now cancer free. Another little story. I was in Sears wandering around looking at things waiting to meet up with my sister-in-law for lunch when this lady approached me. She started off by saying she didn't want to intrude but how was I doing with my treatments. I was a little shocked to think that it was that obvious. But after talking to her she told me that she had just gone through treatment as well for lung cancer. She had both chemo and radiation at the same time. She's one year out from treatments and all her hair is back and she's feeling pretty good. There is hope and we shouldn't give up before the miracle happens for us. I asked my sister-in-law if she thought I looked like a chemo patient as she hadn't seen me since I started chemo. Other than looking pale she couldn't tell. I guess it's like the old saying: It takes one to know one. Thursday I get my blood work done to see if the WBC are okay for my next infusion. Although I have no idea where they're going to fine a suitable vein because my arm is swollen and sore from the last three. They told me it can takes months before the veins go back to normal. If they have to put it in my foot or my leg then I can't get up to go to the bathroom. I don't think they'll be very happy if I pee in their chair. Lol! Glad when this is all over. ",

Most people can't tell that I have no hair unless they look real close or unless I go for the shock factor and take the hat off. Tried on the wig again yesterday just to see if I could make it look somewhat reasonable. Still looks horrible. It was only on for about ten minutes and it was already too hot to handle. I do have a bamboo buff that I wear around the house which I highly recommend for sleeping. Oh, so soft. Keeps my head warm and it breathes. Plus I don't have to see myself when I pass that mirror and wonder who that bald headed person is looking back at me. Although, I am getting use to the bald look. There's this baby fine hair that just doesn't want to fall out. Last night DH said it looks like it's growing. I want to shave it but my hairdresser says no because then it'll be stubble which will be more aggravating as it grows back in. I guess it's the \"baby's head\" look for now. I too have gone outside and forgot to wear something on my head. Oh well, now, they know. I always think it's amazing when they ask if my hair will grow back. Really!! You've never heard about chemo side effects. I hope they never get cancer. I hope no one ever gets cancer ever again. It's such a despicable disease. Changes you forever!!! This time around (#2), no real side effects other than everything tastes like cardboard and feeling tired more than usual. Can't get that awful taste out of my mouth no matter what I do! Even with the treatment I still worry that this will come back. Everyone I know says that they're confident that I'll beat this. There's so much that's unknown with this disease.

There's some interesting articles on the benefits of exercise on the main site here. One of the benefits is that is reduces the risk of breast cancer coming back. Even a little bit every day helps with side effects and your overall health. Here's one link: https://community.breastcancer.org/livegreen/exerc... My eye specialist recommended Systane Ultra, Hydration. It's good for people with contacts. I also use Systane Balance. All their products are preservative free. It's funny they don't list dry eyes as a side effect of chemo but so many people have it. The peach fuzz on top of my head is actually growing. My leg and armpit hair have stopped. Yeah, one blessing in all of this. Kim: I got one horrible looking thing from the Cancer clinic for free that looks like a rats nest on top of my head. I think I'll stick to hats and scarves. It's going to be a long haul without any hair for at least another four months. On day 13 of chemo #2, days 10 -12 are always the worst for me. Lots of diarrhea, cramps, nausea. I did some research and that's when the Epirubicin side effects take action. Only one more AC left then it's on to docetaxel and a whole new list of side effects. Is anyone also doing radiation after their chemo? Peachy: you look gorgeous either way. HapB: You're so lucky you can have a cat. I used to have cats but was allergic to them. My allergy specialist kept saying I needed to get rid of them but no way, no how was I getting rid of my babies. When they finally passed I got dogs instead. Here's a picture of me and one of my dogs, Max, at the Airport doing pet therapy for the departures level at Christmas time. All three of my dogs have been trained for pet therapy. We use to go to schools, nursing homes, special events. Had to give it up as it's too risky during chemo. Now, they just cuddle with me. ",

Came close to backing out yesterday but the nurse was so awesome and calmed me down. Talked to me and of course an Ativan helped. I know my side effects haven't been even close to what others are experiencing but it wears me down. Seems like every time I go for an infusion there's a loud talker with a whole family of people crowded around. This last one was partially deaf. Daughter kept yelling can you hear me. Finally my DH said yes I think we can all hear you! Thankfully she was gone shortly after that. A couple of people got to ring the bell and that's always great to hear that someone has made it through. I've finally figured out the side efffects from this FEC only to get new ones from the Docetaxel starting in August. It's a fun journey? Well! Maybe not so much. I know I'm lucky in that I don't have as many chemo sessions as the rest of you. Kudos to all for what we have to go through. Intragirl I don't know how I'd manage without air conditioning. My DH keeps our house like a feeezer locker so every now and then I go outside to get warmed up. Lol! I've heard about fasting but wasn't sure about it. Mostly I walk on the treadmill which really helps with the fatigue. Have you tried the icing of fingers and toes? Not sure yet if I'll try it. Day to day! Vivanlu8 hope it saves your hair. The Cross Cancer is okay with it but they only ever had one person try it. I was okay with losing mine since I don't go to work now that I'm retired. It's only when I go out to a restaurant that I feel uncomfortable. Don't want to wear the hat but have come to be comfortable with my buff on. I figure it'll grow back. I'm kind of getting use to seeing myself with no hair although it's taken over a month to look at myself and wonder who that is looking back at me, 😂. On the plus side no leg or armpit hair for well over a month. That can never come back and I'd definitely be okay with that. 😉 I guess with the docetaxel I'll lose more. Although there's not a lot left to lose. The nurse said some people actually lose the whole nail. Now won't that be fun. Keep sharing. Love hearing from everyone. Keeps me motivated and encouraged to keep on going. 💖💖💖 🤗🤗🤗 all around ",

As it is I haven't worn a bra since my operation in April and nobody notices. I wear a camisole. Breasts have never been a part of my identity because I've never had any being small. But for the majority of women it is part of their identity. Kim: So happy for you. You look amazing in the picture. Pretty hard to tell that you've been through chemo. Some days I think what shall I do today now that I don't have chemo to worry about then I remember, oh ya, I have to go to radiation. Well, it's true what they say about radiation being short. It takes more time to go there, undress, redress than it does for the treatment. Even with me having radiation on both sides and the lymph nodes it only takes about 15 minutes. It takes more time for them to set you up than it does for the actual radiation. I'm following Hap's advice and not using any lotions or deodorant. 2 down and 18 to go. One more piece of advice, make sure you do those exercises they give you. I didn't think I'd need them but even with only 2 treatments I can feel the muscles starting to tighten up already. This week I've actually started to get my energy back. Taste buds are almost there. Sugary things still taste kind of bitter. My nails have three lines of bumps on them. Eyes are still watering but I think they're getting better. Nose isn't running anymore. I counted and I've been through 9 boxes of Kleenex since the end of July.

If aspirin was to come on the market today they'd have it behind the counter as a prescription drug because it has lots of side effects. I chose the Letrozole only because it has less side effects that were better for me personally. I think the Tamoxifen is probably the better drug based on how it works but because I've already been through menopause 15 years ago, I had the option of one or the other. Power on ladies!",

I didn't think my hair would ever grow back but if I catch my reflection in just the right light I can see some hair. Three weeks apart seems to be the norm for infusions. I'm guessing that's because most of our body cells regenerate on that time schedule. The only cells that don't are the hair (ha ha who would have guessed that one) and our digestive system (uh, huh) which regenerate minute by minute or day by day? I'm with you on wanting this to all be over with. I'm not a big fan of changes in life but cancer has been a huge change all at once. I'm still getting use to it. You will too. We all will.",

I\u2019ve noticed since I\u2019ve been doing more treadmill that my SOB has gone and my complexion is returning to normal. Go easy at first but as each day passes you\u2019ll notice that you can do a little longer and faster than the day before. I was never a big exercise fan but lately have noticed it sure helps. Do what you can each day. Every little bit helps. Even ten minutes. And remember it all takes time.

I gave my shot at night that way the majority of the pain was during the night. This time I got pain meds as Tylenol didn't really help for me. I went for my blood work yesterday. Not good news. RBC are decreasing fast and furious. Depending on how low they go after this round I may a blood transfusion which of course comes with it's own set of side effects on top of all the other chemo side effects. And I was suppose to get my chemo today but unknown to me they switched it to tomorrow without telling me. My DH noticed because I had to book an appointment for a November follow up and he wanted to know what time chemo was for today. The new appointment schedule showed the switch but no one said a thing to me yesterday. I started all my pre meds (Dexamethsone) yesterday based on getting the chemo today and now I'm short on meds by one day. Fun times this chemo trip! ",

Next day I sat outside under the tree and plucked the rest and let it go. Blowing in the wind! Kind of therapeutic. Bet the neighbors were having either a good laugh or wondering where all the hair was coming from getting in their BBQ or flower beds. Still have a hard time seeing myself with no hair. Even after a month I'm still getting use to it. But it does grow back. I decided not to shave the rest of the peach fuzz off at the recommendation of hair dresser. Don't want stubble irritating on my pillow or in my hats. So far it's worked out. Not sure how she's going to cut the peach fuzzz that's left because it is growing. Looks like baby's head. 😂😂 Each person is different in how they handle the hair loss. For someone who faces the public every day or has to work its difficult. How do you go to work with hair or be day and none the next. I don't look good in wigs. Tried on a dozen or more. Even the clerk said I'd look better without one. When I have my baseball cap or my buff on no one can tell I don't have hair. But then I don't have to work. The girls at the grocery store don't seem to notice. Sometimes when I get those stares I whip off my hat just for effect. Hang in there it'll come back just as beautiful as ever.",

I figured why keep something that is going to give me problems. I've always had small breast. I thought by the time they took three lumps out of my left breast there wouldn't be anything left and I didn't want to be lopsided. Once I met with the surgeon she told me that she could easily do a lumpectomy. I also did the research on recurrence rates of mastectomy vs lumpectomy. My decision for bi-lateral lumpectomy was based on three small lumps all in a row on the left and pre-cancerous calcification on the right. My surgeon didn't feel based on the size and locations that it probably hadn't moved in the lymph nodes. My margins were clear after surgery, however, because of the location of the smallest lump in the left breast being so close to the nipple it was removed. I have six inch scars on both breasts which are healing nicely. I had no pain only a seroma on the left side where 6 lymph nodes were removed. All tests results and pathology reports indicated that there was no lymph node involvement. Unfortunately the surgeon and the test results were wrong about having cancer in the lymph nodes. Two out of six nodes were macrometastic. My recovery time was easy, with no pain, and healing was good. I'm due for a CAT scan June 1 to see if the cancer is anywhere else in my body.The next part for me will be chemo, then radiation. Chemo I'm told is much easier now than in the past with 99% of people losing their hair as the major side effect and that both Chemo and radiation can cause extreme fatigue. Did I make the right decision? I took a gamble and for the most part I think it's paid off. It's such a personal decision. I could definitely live with my breasts. They have never been my most redeeming quality. They don't define me in any way at this stage in my life. The younger you are the more meaningful they are to you. But I do know women who would feel less of a women without them.",
