I am hoping that we can stick with the radiation therapy since that is the route I am prepared to go, but I will listen to what the med onc says and then make a decision based on all the facts, even if am leaning towards refusing chemo.",

Can I drink alcohol on Tamoxifen?  I want to have a strawberry margarita at Epcot since I didn't get to do that in March when I was there for my birthday.",

It is IDC...stage 2 because of the size of the tumor.  Met with my radiologist today and said there would be a series of 33 rads treatments and it would be pretty easy.  Now my question is the possibility of chemo.  The rads dr seemed to think I would need chemo, but my surgeon was pretty sure that I wouldn't.  If the med. onc says chemo, can I refuse that treatment and stick with the rads?  I have no problem doing the rads, but the chemo is a different story. There is absolutely no history of cancer in any family member so this one came out of the blue.",
