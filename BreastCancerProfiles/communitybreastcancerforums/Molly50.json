First of all, you are entitled to a copy of your pathology report and your images. Call your doctor or the imaging center and request a copy. Then let us know what the pathology report says. In the meantime, here is a great thread to get started Getting Started. When I got the call from the radiologist letting me know it was breast cancer, she gave me the basics over the phone. ER/PR positive approximate size of tumor etc. My doctor called with a referral to a surgeon that same day. As for the fear, well the first few weeks while you figure out what the plan is can be scary, overwhelming and sometimes frustrating. This community helps with a place to ask questions and vent. It will get better once you know your diagnosis and have a plan in place.",

The fatigue can be tough, though I found the muscle spasms from the TE to be the hardest part. One thing I did after a ruptured hematoma after my second umx (I had two units of blood transfused) was to be purposeful in my eating and resting to get myself strong enough to return to work. I ate plenty of protein, fiber and dark green foods along with plenty of water. I ate prunes every day (I hate prunes) and still do. I am not judging anyone's fatigue and you should take the time you need to recover but that was my 4th surgery in a year and I had it with being in fatigue mode. It worked. I was back to work in a week even though my BS thought I was crazy. My best healing wishes and prayers to all of you. I certainly hope this surgery goes well for me and I can recover quickly again.

It took about 5 months for mine to end up where they are and yes my radiated side did soften and drop a tiny bit. My right non radiated side has slid to the side so unless I wear a really good bra I have a huge gap between my foobs. Neither one is soft like I expected and my right side has awful scars because my PS tried to lift it to match the other one. They are sort of level but righty looks smaller and I can see the outline of the implant because of it moving to the side. Needless to say I am unhappy with the way I look without clothing. With a good supportive bra under my clothing I look fine. My radiated side is lumpy and has a huge dent above the implant which started with the TE and I had hoped would go away after exchange. I am going to see if maybe PT can massage it out. It almost seems like it is tight up there like cording. So I am not doing any 3D tats yet because I will probably need some more surgery. UGH!",

I used calendula cream for two weeks leading up to my treatments and have used aquaphor at bedtime ( it is very messy), Miaderm and Aloe Vera gel ( no alcohol in the ingredients list is important!) and Earths Best Baby Calendula. Since I had a umx with a TE I ended up need PT to get my arm fully above my head and must continue to stretch due to the skin shrinking a bit around the TE. I lotion up at least 3 mostly 4 times per day. I also ended up with a radiation rash which my RO prescribed a steroid cream for. Speak up to your team if you have concerns. My rad tech team is awesome. The main one is very observant and notices skin changes even before I do. Good luck!",

The skin shrinkage over the TE can make your pecs pretty tight. Jabe, I ended up buying a cotton bra that goes over my head two sizes too big so that it was just enough support to not flop around but no chaffing. I was wearing just a stretchy bra and it was leaving marks under my breast. The tech told me it was going to be a problem. I also did the cami under a bra which helped.

My RO said we should get about 60 grams of protein per day. Another key for me was the willingness of my RO and team to switch up the treatment schedule to accomodate my very red, tender skin when it started to sting when I put lotion on. This was about 5 weeks into treatment. RO had the team change to boosts for 5 days to let the axilla and under FOOB area rest. Then I had 4 days off for Thanks giving. After boosts she checked me again and instructed the team to skip the last two bolus treatments due to my very red skin. By the time I finished treatment this past Monday I was much better, nearly everything peeled and only a couple areas are still tender. My RO also prescribed EMLA cream for me during the days I had pain. Between that and my tube of lidocain and my Miaderm with lidocain I purchased on Amazon I got through pretty well. I was unable to wear anything but a lightweight tank top the final two weeks. Even the loosest of bras rubbed on my skin in the wrong places. Just hang in there and know that this is doable and to communicate with your team!",

In the meantime after taking time to think about it, had a mammogram on my remaining breast (only benign findings) and discussing with my breast surgeon I decided to have the other breast removed. I do miss having any sensation but my risk of a new cancer was 29% and I just found that, personally, I couldn't live with the stress. I totally respect your decision and I assume you will have alternating mammo and MRI every 6 months so you should be fine. This is a completely personal decision and once your breast is gone there is no changing your mind.",

Good thing too because I had DCIS in the nipple stem as well. If your surgeon wants you to sign a release to switch to mx if necessary I would find another surgeon. You need time to consult with a PS and to wrap your head around losing your breast. You also need time to consider if you want umx or bmx. I don't think many surgeons anymore do this. That was back in the dark ages where women didn't know if they had cancer until they woke up with no breast.",

It's really up to you but with a strong family history make sure you get monitoring for ovarian, colorectal and thyroid at the very least. I am curious, did you get genetic counseling along with your test? That should help you make up your mind. You are correct that the decision about reconstruction is not to be taken lightly. You have time to think about it. Do your research and talk to a genetic counselor if you haven't already.",
