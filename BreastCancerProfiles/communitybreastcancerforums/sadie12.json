I was almost in tears I had just been told that the mass was posibly malignant and now im being told it is slow growing and it will be ok to wait.  Honestly I was not only in shock but terrified. I went home and told family what was going on and I was definatly down and worried but everyone keeps telling me not to worry until I get the biopsy results.  Thats all fine but how can I not be worried and upset when I was told it didnt look good?  I am so tired of hearing that I just want someone that will listen to my fears and talk about how I am feeling and not be cut off and told not to worry.  I definatly have support but I also need to get out how I feel.  Honestly I am terrified about what happens next.  Im sorry I rambled but I just dont know which way to turn now or if I should be so worried, I just really need advice.

Trust me I am so mad I have talked to a supervisor and thats when i was placed on a list so supposedly the next cancellation is mine but we will see.  I am trying not to think the worst thanks to all of you and your experienced advise. My mom passed away in 2005 of a stroke and my mother in law laughs at me when I tell her i am worried about this.  So really have no one else to talk to that will listen.  My next move is going to Mayo clinic in Mn.  and i will if i cant get anything done here.  I have cancer on my dads side of the family so the thought of cancer scares me to death.  Anyway, thanks for all of your advise and you will all know as soon as I do and yes I to pray everyday for it to be B9",

Right now unfortunatly I am still worried that it will be malignant. Thank you again I am so glad I found this site.",
