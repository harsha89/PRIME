I would not worry to much about the heart issues they are usually a problem for older women, also they watch and monitor your heart.   Chemo is tough but it is doable, many of the girls here are able to continue to work while going through treatments, and remember breast cancer is no longer an automatic death sentence.  She will do just fine, and the fact that she is young will help her get through this easier.  Also, you sound like a loving sister, so gather your resources and friends and set up a schedule for meals to be brought in to her and her family the few days after her treatments.  People want to help maybe drive her kids (if she has them) to school or clean her house things like that will really help her.   The Adriamycin is the first one they will do and it is the one that made me really sick the few days following the infusion, but they have really good anti-nausea drugs for that.  It is also the one that will take her hair about 14 days or so after the first infusion.  The next will be the Taxol it never really made me sick just weak and it can give you neuropathy in your fingers and toes.  And the the Herceptin that is a really good drug that is saving so many lives, I had it once a week for 1 year, you just go to the oncologist and get an IV drip for about an hour and then after a few treatments they will cut that time down to 1/2 hour a week.  That one is really doable and that is the one that they really monitor your heart function.  But not many bad side affects to that one for most people.  And the radiation was very easy for me, it just made me really tired and a little sore.   They will probably want to give your sister a port, it is an easy surgery.  But a port will save her veins and it makes the infusions pretty painless as far as needles. This is something you and your sister will be looking back on in years to come and realizing that it made you closer.   Just try to cry with her when you need to and laugh when you can and have fun when you can.  Hope this helps Sherry",

Stage IIIA Stage IIIA describes invasive breast cancer in which: Stage IIIB This stage describes invasive breast cancer in which a tumor of any size has spread to the breast skin, chest wall, or internal mammary lymph nodes (located beneath the breast right under the ribs, inside the middle of the chest). Stage IIIB includes inflammatory breast cancer, a very uncommon but very serious, aggressive type of breast cancer. The most distinguishing feature of inflammatory breast cancer is redness involving part or all of the breast. The redness feels warm. You may see puffiness of the breast's skin that looks like the peel of a navel orange (\"peau d'orange\"), or even ridges, welts, or hives. And part or all of the breast may be enlarged and hard. A lump is present only half of the time. Inflammatory breast cancer is sometimes misdiagnosed as a simple infection. sherry",

So my oncologist order an MRI... UGH.... I am extremely claustrophobic,  I have not cried in months and today I cried when they put me in the machine.  They had to pull me back out.  They allowed my husband to come in the MRI room to help me, but that didn't even work.  I took a xanax before I went to the hospital just not in time for it to take affect.  I had to have them put a rag on my eyes, that helped.  I think I would have been a little better had they not taped my head down, and they put this cage thing on my head.  UGH...But about 10 minutes into the MRI the xanax took affect and I was much calmer. I read you girls talking about HER 2 + having an increased risk of brain mets,  I had never heard that before, is that from new research?  I also had slurred speech about 2 months ago,  but didn't really think it might be something with my brain until now.  I am also worried that maybe I may have had a small stroke ( listen to me thinking  of the worst).  I just chalked the slurred speech to side effects from my meds. I guess I will find out in a few days.    Thanks girls I am sorry I just read this part of the forum is for stage IV,  should I delete this and post somewhere else.",

My insurance company nor myself had to pay for any of the 52 herceptin treatments I got. There were a total of 5000 bc patients that were treated free of charge because of being in this trial.  Yes, they were to some degree using us as guinea pigs, but I am grateful for what they gave me as we pay for our own health insurance ($800.00) a month.  If the cost of the herceptin and other care I got while on the trial would have went on our insurance it would have cost my insurance company an additional $100,000 which I know would have put the cost of our insurance way out of our reach.  So, I am grateful for whoever paid for it, maybe the drug company maybe donations I'm not sure but I am sure glad it was made possible for me and the 4,999 others. One thing you can be sure of is that the people that own the drug companies and the people that do the research and also the doctors who treat us also have grandmothers, mothers, wives, daughters and even males in their families that have been touched by this horrible monster.  So I am sure they would love to find a cure for this horrible disease if they could. If this horrible disease ends up taking my life I will be happy knowing that there are many who have been cured by the research that has been done. ",

I had chest pressure for about 7-8 months, the doctors thought it was my heart, I was even on heart meds at 42 years old,( I do not have mets) my chest pressure ended up being, a esophagus condition called Barretts esophagus.  I started on daily Nexium and the chest pain disappeared within a few days and I went off the heart meds.  So you may ask your doctor for a gastro medicine.  I think it's worth a try.  Also you could ask for a nerve medicine such as Xanax or Valuim and take it when you feel that way and if it goes away it must have been anxiety.  I think you might need to go through the process of elimination.  Hang in there sherry",

( They give you free make-up and scarves)  I would think if you can find one of those classes, that, one of the ladies there would shave your hair.   Just remember it does grow back, most of the time better than it was.  I was only a year without hair.  I just passed my 3 year diagnosis date and I have hair past my shoulders and I have had alot of hair cuts.  Hang in there and keep coming here for support. sherry",

So when I had my lumpectomy the surgeon also did the axillary node dissection at the same time.  I had a hard time with the surgery,  I had alot of pain under my arm, so much that I could not put my arm down to my side for about a month after surgery.  I still don't have feeling in my underarm after 3 years.  But I am not complaining because in am cancer free, it is a small price to pay to be able to say that.  I also agree with unlimited when she said to get the port at the same time as the node removal it will save you another surgery, and you will definitely want a port if you are getting chemo and that surgery is real easy and almost painless. I hope I haven't scared you but I wish I would have know more about the axillary node dissection surgery before I got it, so I would have know what to expect.  I hope you don't mind my honest experience about my surgery.

Chemo nurses can access it, but a nurse say in you primary doctors office probably will not be able to access it.  So if you are getting it for chemo infusion I say go for it, but if you are getting it just so it will be able to be used for occasional blood draws and IV's outside of the chemo office, I would say it would not be of much benefit.  The reason I can say this is because I had a lot of gallbladder attacks and I had pancreatitus during treatment that sent me to the hospital and it would either take forever for a qualified nurse to come and access it or they would say they couldn't use it.  When my surgeon put my port in he said to make sure I didn't let just any nurse access it because of the high risk of infection.  He told me if I had to go to the ER to not even tell them I had a port.  He only wanted the chemo nurses or the cancer floor nurses at the hospital to access it.  Also my port always worked for chemo infusions, but it would not always give a blood return so some days I ended up getting stuck in my port and also in my arm so they could get the blood they needed.  Sorry this is so long but I thought I would give you my experience. I have since had my port removed, and now when I get the occasional blood draw they use my good arm and it seems it gets harder for them to find a good vein,  I worry they will have to go to my foot or somewhere else to get blood.
