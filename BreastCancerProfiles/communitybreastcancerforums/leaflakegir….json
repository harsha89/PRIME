I found the lump in the left breast just before Christmas 2017, I saw my breast Dr and had an U/S but it did not show up on the U/S. I was already schedule for a breast MRI at the end of January so I was told to leave the lump alone and wait for the MRI. I have extremely dense breast tissue so I do alternating MRI's and mammos every 6 months. The spot showed up on the MRI so I had a MRI guided Biopsy on Feb 1 and got the results on Feb 5 that it was ADH. I was referred to the breast surgeon for a lumpectomy and had surgery on Feb 19. Nothing else was found. I was suppose to start Tamoxifen but have not started it as 3 weeks post lumpectomy I have developed what is called Mondors disease so they don't want me starting the Tamoxifen until that clears up. I had a total hysterectomy last May 2017 and I think that was easier than going through this. I feel I healed way faster from that then I have from this. Wearing a bra is a pain in the butt and I can't wait to get home from work to take it off and I 4 weeks post lumpectomy now. I will see the breast doctor again in 4 weeks and have another scan to see if the mondors disease is cleared up and then hopefully start the Tamoxifen. My question for you ladies is this. when I had my MRI they found the ADH and I had the biopsy but I also had a lymphnode on that same breast that was of minimal increase prominence in the axillary and of questionable clinical significance and they didn't biopsy that. When I asked them why they said they would only biopsy it if the lump came back with cancer and it didn't so there was no need to biopsy the lymph node. Do I need to worry that they missed cancer in this lymph node because they didn't biopsy that..",
