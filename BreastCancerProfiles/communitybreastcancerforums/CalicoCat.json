I'm one of those for whom tumor markers have, in 99% of cases, been indicative of whether my BC was progressing or remitting. I know this isn't true of everyone. I took a break from Abraxane for 3 weeks over Christmas, and the marker CA15-3 went from the 100's to the 500's. After one treatment of Doxil, it went to 1080. After the 2nd Doxil treatment, it came down 40 points (not real impressive). Me thinks my next CT will look really &%#%! And with all this increase in tumor markers, the only obvious bad effects have all come from the BC treatment side effects, not the BC. What irony. xoxooxoxox Calico.",

Your singing will no doubt be a great comfort to the family and friends gathered in her name today. I've had mets in the lungs about 2 years, and didn't share it with my family until just recently. The news certainly shook me up, and I knew it would worry them as well. Since the lung mets hadn't reached the level of ending my life on the planet yet, I didn't feel compelled to tell them. Your friend's sister may have felt the same way. I have had many different treatments which are shown at the bottom of this post. None of them was to specifically target lung mets, as the BC has spread to other areas as well. I'm not an oncologist, and don't know which might be helpful in the sister's case. I think the most important questions are to what extent has the sister made her wishes known to her family, or if anyone has the sister's Power of Attorney for Health Care, and what it specifies. It sounds like the person who broke the lung mets news to your friend did it in a very inappropriate and unfortunate way, and it's easy to seize on one piece of information in a complicated medical problem, and focus on that. The doctors and family really need to look at the big picture, and what kind of quality of life the sister can expect if she survives. Prayers going up for peace, Calico",

My breathing problems got worse as I went to Navelbine and Abraxane, but my lung mets got worse, too, so it's really not possible to tell what's affecting what. My onc always says the mets in my lungs aren't bad enough to cause me shortness of breath, and he didn't think it was the chemo, either, but oncs can be like that, never wanting to blame things on either the cancer or the chemo. The onc sent me to a pulmonologist, and I had a lung biopsy and a lung capacity test. The biopsy confirmed the presence of lung mets, but that we knew already. The lung capacity test results were that shortness of breath was caused by both COPD and the chemo. Seems like even when I get enough air, it's not being utilized by my body because of the chemo. That's how I understood it anyway. So shortness of breath is complicated. I will tell you it got considerably better with a 3-week vacation from Abraxane before I started the Doxil. Don't know if any of this will help, but hope it might at least a little. xoxoxoxox Calico ",

May you have an even better outcome! I had trouble, or thought I did, adding Halaven to the end of my chemo list.

I got (and still have) leg swelling on Abraxane (the chemo before Doxil before Havalen . . . . . ) which hasn't completely resolved, and my onc isn't willing to admit it was the chemo. I've been checked for blood clots in my legs and there aren't any. I got neuropathy in spades with the Abraxane and am going to be watching closely for worsening, which sounds common. My hair had grown out to about 1/2\" after the Abraxane, so here it goes again. Maybe third time is the charm. I just recently started MiraLAX for constipation, but am ALSO eating 10 prunes and drinking warm prune juice. Whatever the case, I've seen a great deal of improvement. I'm going to next ratchet down on the prunes and juice and see if I can do just as well with MiraLAX alone. Anyway, thanks for being here! xoxoxoxox Calico",

I think the description of the syndrome as a chemical burn from within is very appropriate. I'm wondering if the Fruit of the Earth 100% Aloe Vera Gel like I used with radiation might not help. I don't know how much it really penetrates, but it's an amazing lotion. Anyway, I'll give it a try. I found this link which gives the long and official name of hand-foot syndrome: Hand Foot Syndrome I looked over the Xeloda website more carefully, and it says that patients shouldn't think Xeloda isn't working because they stop it because of HFS. In other words, it's not a \"No pain, No gain\" situation. We can stop the drug and the benefit continues, at least for a time, so taking a break from the drug doesn't set us back to square one, and the fact that we have really terrible HFS doesn't mean the drug is working better. Maybe I'll try the B6 supplement as it was mentioned on several reputable sites. Thanks again, and see you on the trail! Calico",

There are many different causes and types of neuropathy. For example, I've had neuropathy in my arms and hands since 1997 which occurred because of spinal cord compression in my neck. The spinal cord and nerves running out of it are injured and sending those pain signals to my arms/hands, so the actual tissues of the arms/hands aren't injured, only the nerves. With HFS, it seems the actual tissues are damaged, and should be able to heal in the absence of some other assault on the nerves (like with another added chemo).
