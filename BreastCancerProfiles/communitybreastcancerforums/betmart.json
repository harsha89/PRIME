I have read the responses to fd411's post \"How were your mets diagnosed?\" and it seemed to me that most of the responders were diagnosed through tests of some kind, not symptoms. But I'd like to ask once again here for responses -- Were you diagnosed because of symptoms or tests? Please take a moment to respond -- I am writing a magazine article about this.

My onc ordered surgery to remove it but first said let's get a mammagram because he just didn't think it was lymphoma. Found 1 cm lump in breast, core biopsy revealed BC. Went to surgery not knowing what the lump under arm would be. Lucky (????huh?)for me, both were BC. A recurring lymphoma would have been much worse.",
