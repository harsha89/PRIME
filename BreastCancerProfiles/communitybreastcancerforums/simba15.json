I'm waiting to have a biopsy done on a lump I found a couple of weeks ago in my left breast. It is same breast I had in-situ carcinoma in back in 2001. I am a nervous wreck going on with \"what if's\"! I am normally a positive person, but this second time around is getting the best of me. The waiting is pure murder, excuse expression! The xanax is sounding like a good idea at this moment. Thank you for \"listening\" to me sound off!!!",
