My mom was on it for just seven months and found it so tolerable as well. Bone mets only. Her last scans this month showed possible progression though the radiologist said there was a possibility that the increased activity meant partial healing. Regardless, her onc decided she start faslodex. He mentioned that he has seen that faslodex and AIs work better on bone mets and save chemos for later. Not sure if you have already tried AIs? Good luck with whatever you decide to try next!!",

Her onc did say we could try another AI but thought the chemo would be a better maybe faster route but my mom is so afraid of being completely wiped out when she had chemo (TAC) when originally diagnosed. She actually is considering doing another AI and doc says its up to her. Just so afraid tumors might grow further if we don't do chemo. I guess that's just how it goes, we have to wait and see... We just won't know til we try. Thanks again. Beautiful family pic btw!",

      "Content": "iluv3j wrote: Hello ladies. I'm posting on behalf of my mom. I read many posts here several times a day and think of you all quite often. It's a wonderful forum. We have an appointment with her onc tomorrow to go over next treatment options.Here's her history since learning of bone mets in November 2011: Xeloda worked til about June 2012. PETCT showed slight progression in bones. Onc then switched her to Faslodex. She became pretty anemic and needed aranesp biweekly to help with fatigue. Also other side effects like sore throat and dryness made it hard for her to eat. We decided to give faslodex six months to hopefully work and got a pet scan earlier this month. Pet scan showed metabolic activity in her liver and a CT scan a few days later confirmed a 7 mm spot. Onc has suggested that we try chemo and suggested Navelbine, halaven, Gemzar Abraxane or Ixempra. I asked if we can do any other AIs since she hasn't tried them all and he said \"there are no right or wrong answers\". Although we know that is true in this case, it would help to know which route would be best at this point? Would she even be able to do chemo with her being anemic (9.4 level) and so fatigued all the time? I'm afraid she would be worse off and her QOL would suffer even more. Are there any AIs out there that are pretty effective on liver mets? Or is chemo our best bet at this point? Advice please? Thanks so much.
