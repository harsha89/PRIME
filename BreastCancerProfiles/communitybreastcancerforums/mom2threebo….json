Reading all of your stories helped me to prepare and made me experience much more bearable. I went on a fact finding mission of sorts, asking lots of questions of the mid level providers (NPs and PAs). They would not prescribe numbing cream and the nuclear techs would not use separate shots of xylocaine to numb prior to injection. They did say nuclear med would give numbing cream 10 min in advance. I knew from reading on here as well as the pharmaceutical website that the cream's optimum numbing capability would take more than 10 min so I checked in early and nuclear med was fine with me putting the cream on in advance. I also had pain and anxiety meds for ongoing pain from fracturing my spine and 2 ribs several months ago and my surgeon's office cleared me to take those. Finally, for me I had 2 injections around my tumor site and two around the nipple. I felt no pain, but only because my BC sisters had prepared me :-) I was very careful to check with medical professionals before doing any of this, especially since we are only 24 hrs pre surgery. Don't want to cause complications or delays there! So prepare in advance, ask questions and double heck everything with your doctor's staff. Good luck to everyone!",
