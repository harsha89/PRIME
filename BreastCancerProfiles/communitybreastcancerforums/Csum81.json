I wish (and I know there isn't) a quick way to insert all of the things about me to help decide which is the best option. My options: TC (Texotere/Cytoxin) vs. ACT (Andriamycin/Cytoxin plus Taxofin) I'm looking to see if there is anyone that may have many of the same symptoms/stats I have and is going to/or has had either of the treatments listed above and the reasoning you were given for it...better outcome vs. the other etc...

Again, thank you all for looking at this - if you have some of these symptoms...and especially are younger please let me know if you did either of these treatments/had the choice/and again, why you chose or were told to choose one over the other. Thank you!! Dx DCIS/IDC, Right, 1cm, Stage IA, Grade 3, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
