I'm 22 with 2 lumps to visible bulges/indentations, an inverted nipple when I lay down (it never used to be like that and the other is normal) this breast is also two sizes bigger than the right. My OB only felt the lumps and spent no time with me. He said they are probably fibroadenomas. He sent me for a mammo and ultrasound and they both came back normal. No has me going to see a general surgeon. I'm praying this guy will take me seriously and listen to all my problems. I'm very frustrated and know my body very well and thus isn't right. Any advice?
