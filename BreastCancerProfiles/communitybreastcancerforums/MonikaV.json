After changing doctors, the new doctor ordered an 2-Echo, and I was hospitalized with an open heart surgery due to a blood clot the size of a golf ball inside my right atrium. I guess what i am trying to tell you... Be on top of it! Ask your doctor for an EKG and 2- D echo. Just in case. Good luck! Monika",
