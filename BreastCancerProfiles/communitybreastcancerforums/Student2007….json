Our module leader has set us an assignment to choose a specialist area to develope a range of garments for. After careful consideration, I chose Swimwear for women who have undergone mastectomy (hope i spelt it right? :S)  As I would like to raise awareness as a young woman myself, I sympatheise with all you strong women out there who have undergone or continuing treatment due to breast cancer and believe there should be more options available for this area of the retail market as swimwear is worn in the public eye therefore every woman should have the confidence to feel comfortable, look feminine and feel sexy. I would greatly appreciate your input on how retailers may lack what women want or look for when purchasing swimwear garments. Is there any particular retailer you prefer to purchase swimwear from and why? Are there any trends (i.e particular design or print) in swimwear that you particulary would like to see in high street retailers? If you have purchased swimwear before, what kind of padding etc has been used? I dont personally know of anyone who has undergone breat cancer surgery or treatment therefore my research is restricted. It is also a very sensitive subject for many women so I cannot approach an unknown individual to dicuss this topic on a one to one basis, therefore please feel open minded to share your thoughts and opinions. I greatly admire the strength and determination in every woman who has and is dealing with breast cancer. Thankyou and I look forward to everyones input. Stay strong x Log in to post a reply",

It really does help narrow down the type of styles/design features/fabric I will have to consider for my finaly range. I would like to look into mastectomy bras but since my project is mostly based on garments that have a specialised function to them with inspiration taken from Fall/Winter 2008 I have to stick to the guide lines rather than look at lingerie. I have noted down so far about what you all look for and it has helped so much! Since I have to design and produce two ranges I might design for women aged in their 20s-30s and another for women in their 40s-50s so its more varied. I will have to look in more depth about the extent after surgery and try to design a attractive yet comfortable ( for scarring etc) look. OldBinNJ - you have mentioned about two places you purchased your swimsuits from. I am from England U.K and havent heard of these places here? Are these shops or online shopping places? If you have any online websites I can visit I would be greatful if you could forward the web address? CaaClark - you have also mentioned breast free site? And Amonea? Is this another site or can I visit from this site? I have had a browse here but cant seem to find it so likewise if you could possibly forward the online address it would be greatly appreciated. The only designer I know of in England is Amanda Lee who has an online website where you can purchase such specialised bras/swimsuits from if you would like to have a view. Just type in her name in yahoo or google. Shes been an inspiration so far so I have looked at a few of her designs and would be greatful and welcome any online websites I could visit to view their designs. Thankyou again. Look forward to the replies and inputs from you all. x",

Ive made the first prototype mastectomy swimwear costume for a woman between 20-30 years of age! Its a halter neck but not too low and has cut out bodice and ive shaped the bust area to fit a 34 B cup size protheses in which has gathers in. Its in a navy blue solid colour. I will insert an image of it when Ive finished the other one! The other one which im nearly finished with is a similiar bust style but gathers through the bodice which i feel would suit a woman in 40+ age range! Hope you are all well. Will post the images soon. let me know what you all think! Stressed! Student x",
