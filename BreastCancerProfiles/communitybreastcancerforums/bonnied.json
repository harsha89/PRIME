Make the Commonweal tea and keep a batch in the fridge for when you want some ginger tea. It is wonderful.",

I absolutely believe that we are what we eat. Above are a few links to some nutritional ideas and recipes you might take a look at as you go thru chemo or are preparing yourself for chemo. My chemo hasn't begun yet but I spent this weekend making bone broths to put in my freezer and for drinking each day. I have also made the tea (second link above) which is delicious and highlights ginger. If you have never tried fresh ginger, now is your opportunity. It is not only anti-nausea type herb but anti bacterial, anti-fungal, and way more qualities. The bone broths have minerals and amino acids that are easy for the body to digest. When we are on chemo our quality of health is diminished. If you have this broth easy to get to in your fridge or freezer and drink it regularly I bet it would help your body to rebuild what chemo is taking apart. I love to cook and am a bit of a foodie for healthy, but very delicious food. I am anxious to see how chemo affects all this. Rebecca Katz' books are great. She talks about how to season foods when your taste buds are outta whack by adding FASS: fats, acid, salt, sweet depending on what a dish needs. You do not want to be repulsed by food you eat especially during chemo, so if soup or tea is all you can tolerate, why not set yourself up with those easy things. I am an omnivore but I recently completed a plant based cooking certification that was a 6 month online cooking course..and fabulous. Sorry for the rant..but when we eat well, we feel much better.  Hope all had a nice Sunday afternoon. xo",

You and I are the same age or close enough (i am 57). I never take drugs or prescription meds\u2026and love to go herbal when possible. I do take vitamins. The thought of having all this chemo and anti nausea meds running through our bodies is scary at best. Take the anti nausea meds and know that it is temporary and you can detox yourself as you go down the chemo road. I start Dec 1 and get my port in next week. Hang in there and be comfortable as possible. My primary physician said that many chemo patients will use acupuncture to counter effects of chemo as it relates to nausea. Erica, the worst has to be behind you! The chemo will be a breeze though not easy as we all know but stay positive and let us here support you. We are BC warriors! Urahh! Leslieinva, It sounds like you are hanging in there and working through it. Are you working while you do chemo? I am going to continue to work. They know at work that I may have a tough day here and there and are giving me a long line to work through it. I just made a recipe in Rebecca Katz' cancer book Cancer Fighting Kitchen called Cozy Comfy Chicken and Rice. It is basically arroz con pollo. She talks about how our taste buds change when on chemo and talks ways to make food taste better to chemo altered taste buds. I have been making a number of things from her books and will compare the taste differences as i try them again during the chemo weeks. Happy Friday friends\u2026 let rest be your friend this weekend..",

Jovigal, you look awesome! I love your outfit and the pink cupcake. Your wonderful smile will get you through chemo! I am still set for Dec 1 for round 1. So i may be the last of our group to get going on this adventure so I will be the cheerleader for now since i still have my energy to root for all! toot toot! Now is the time to let others do for us and to pamper ourselves. Get a comfy blanket, slippers, cozy clothes and food that tastes good. When others ask what they can bring to you, look at your list and tell it to others. A good friend wants to bring food so I told her to make me some soups in 1-2 portion containers. Maybe without cream or dairy would be another thing to tell others or use dairy alternatives (coconut milk, various nut milks..etc. ) xoxo Hubby is teaching tonight so i am solo for dinner. Might have more miso soup leftovers or put some dal together. keep your strength up by eating plenty of protein and healthy fats (avocados, nut butters, olives, tahini, etc\u2026) and watch the carbs..make each calorie count.",

I work in a sales and consulting role, helping people, both residential, commercial and municipal clients make decisions about their trees. I enjoy the work and like knowing that I am helping people have healthy and beautiful trees. I work with 2 other sales arborists plus my sales manager, office manager, and about a dozen tree guys who perform all the work we sell. I have been with this company for 14 years (starting 15 years on Jan 30). Sometimes I give talks to garden clubs or other organizations. I served a 2 year term as president for our industry mid-atlantic chapter (last 2 years) of over 1100 arborists from VA-MD-WV-DC areas. It is an interesting job for sure. I love all the people i have met over my 25 years in the tree care industry. One day i want to change to a culinary type job, maybe teaching home cooks who want to learn cooking skills using whole food ingredients or consulting privately with people who are ready to transform their kitchens from one that has lots of processed stuff to a better way of eating. I am learning to use herbs for health, starting tinctures, salves, teas, and of course culinary. I am a total spice nut! About 8 years ago i threw out all of my spices that had no smell or taste and started over, buying mostly whole spices and have been growing herbs during the growing season. This year I bought a dehydrator and have dried a lot of the fresh herbs (chives, parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme, mints, etc) for use during the winter months. Last January I began a 6 month online plant based cooking certification. I learned more than i ever thought over those 6 months ranging from making soups & salads, to world cuisines and raw cuisine (3 weeks of the raw cuisine was fascinating!). I am an omnivore and love everything but i also love vegetarian and vegan eating and cooking.  My former life was spent as an international flight attendant for the now defunct Pan American Airways. I was based in London, New York and Washington DC during my 13 years. It was a great chapter of my life and one I never regret. My motto: Variety is the spice of life. Thank you for asking me to share\u2026 I'd love to hear from our other team members on who you are and what you are all about. xoxo Bonnie",

My sister is a pilot for American Airlines now and recently checked out on the new Dreamliner 787 which they will fly in the new year. Small world with airlines. Someone was asking if my life was like the Pan Am show that was on not too long ago. There were moments like that and it was back in an era when flying for an airline had more glamour than it does today. Even before I flew (80's) it was even fancier and more upscale than it is today. I loved that we were trained to serve 8+ courses in First class and served food with fork & spoons instead of tongs. Lots of food service in our training (in honolulu for six weeks) as well as safety related training. Glad you joined our group.

I recently had turkey for the office party so brought home all the leftovers. I think sanitation will be important around chemo time and beyond. This weekend we are cleaning up the bathrooms and doing some vacuuming and changing shower curtains. I bought some Dove soap that is gentle on the skin for showering. It is a bit fragrant so wondering if that will be a problem. Shopping and planning for hair loss next week but I don't anticipate hair loss till second week or so in Dec.

My neighbor made me lunch yesterday and shared her wig (from her chemo days) and all her scarves. I was actually excited!

The counseling and outside help would give you some much needed support even if you dont have it with your husband. He needs to be there to support you but if he cannot you have to find support in other ways. You are stronger than you know and realize. Ask for help from friends. Reach out to friends and family. People you would never imagine are available to take you here and there. Just ask. The local support systems thru cancer groups are amazing. see what is in your area and reach out at your earliest convenience. Metta, I understand about the alcohol thing. My husband also drinks daily and has his habit i wish he would quit. I am lucky he is supportive during all of this for me. In my heart of hearts i wish he would take care of his own health and stop drinking. He suffers depression too i think and has back, weight and knee problems too. He is nine years senior to me at 65. sigh. I have a hard time approaching him about quitting but it is alife long friend. Never any abuse to me but sometimes takes it out on my oldest son (23)...makes me sad. Enough of my own soapbox.... I love all you ladies here and am happy to be able to be supportive of all on our cancer journey together. All in all my husband is supportive and is also in pain as a caregiver too. He needs self care as well and I understand that. Sheeba, send me your email if you havent already and i will send an invite to the FB group. Because it is a secret FB group you will not ind it in a search. That is the appeal to all who have joined it is that it stay a closed and private group. Minivan, I am so sorry to hear about your troubles with the insurance. Stay vigilant and on top of it all and contact the insurance and start a dialog with them if you havent already. That can help enormously to be in closer connection with them so no surprises on the back end. Happy new year and love to all....",

I know how you feel with an already healthy lifestyle yet we are putting these chemicals in our bodies to undue all the good that we are trying to do with our lifestyles. Many here are still making surgery decisions. My surgery for two lumps was back in September. I am early stage so decided on partial mastectomy and breast reduction on both sides. They took a small area out of the right and two small (1cm or less) out the left. I was only out of work for two weeks which my employer totally covered. We eat organic food from a local farm (full diet CSA) that includes raw dairy and yogurt and goat cheese, eggs, organically raised pork, beef and chicken. No processed foods....I think the healthy diet and habits have helped to manage the SE's between chemo treatments. Keep up with your protein intake , avoid fried foods, drink water and start your day with a healthy breakfast. Good luck with quitting your job. I hope you feel good about the decision and it will be a positive turning point for you. Metta, my third A/C round put me into nadir where you have no white cells. It had me flat on my back from Friday thru noon Tuesday. The nurse today told me that my feeling better was a good sign my count rebounded. I will know in the next day or so when today's results are posted online. I wonder if my 4th AC (had today) will send me into nadir this time. Dr said this was the worst phase and that I would be home free when we start taxol. I am encouraged. You will do fine with surgery just as you are with chemo. Have a good week to all! bonnie",

She suggested that i increase my protein to 1.5 times my normal intake and watch the carb intake most of all. I am working on taking in bone broths, nettle tea infusions when i think about making them, 2 protein shakes a day. I agree with limiting the raw veg. Seems easier in the winter time when we want warm cooked foods to warm us up. That is kind of a holistic and ayurvedic approach to eating anyway. You know, eating warm foods in winter and more salads and lighter fare in spring and summer. I guess protein intake might be around 90-100 grams a day if you increase it. Protein shakes help boost the count for sure and its easy to put one in the blender and add stuff like ground flax seed and maybe a tablespoon of nutbutter too. The chemo is depleting our reserves so we need to put it back in where we can whether we eat meat or not. I go both ways in that department. I went through a holistic coaching program a few years ago and am a holistic health coach...learned a lot about nuitrition and varied approaches to our wellness. There is so much we can do to improve how we feel each day. Stuff as simple as drinking a glass of water upo waking, having breakfast, limiting caffeine intake (i enjoy coffee mostly on weekends anymore and love it even more that way. I also recently got a certificate in Plant-based cooking...a six month study at home cooking course that was phenomenal. It opened my eyes to the diversity and variety of plant based cooking. I use the skills i learned every day and hope to teach classes or do private consulting one day. I have had minimal side effects with the chemo and think that some of these daily holistic habits have helped minimize symptoms. Sorry for the ramble.. there have been some interesting discussions about nutrition both here and in our FB group. bonnie",

I hope the healing is going well for you. I ride around in a car all day visiting clients and looking at their trees. We work year round and thru the winter months. So I guess my office is my car. It is good to have an office staff to set my appointments out in the field and can give me light days for when I don't feel great. I decided to tell my work peeps right away about my BC and am keeping them in the loop. Lots of support and glad i shared with the team at work. Even the higher up bosses call me from time to time to see how I'm doing. I am lucky i think with respect to work support. Speaking of ginger candies\u2026i found these awesome ginger chews at the local asian market (Lotte asian market) on the asian aisle. They are individual wrapped little ginger candies that are similar in texture to gummy bears. You suck on them and they stick to the roof of your mouth while you suck on them. They are not as intense as the candied ginger and will be a nice thing in the chemo bag or purse. Are you going to Fairfax? Not sure if i asked you earlier. I am at inova Loudoun out in leesburg. The team approach between all doctors has been excellent including the breast nurse navigators who are awesome as mentors. Now you have me thinking about the claritin\u2026not sure i will go that route. I love the herbal approach and will see what i can do with different herbal teas that can manage the congestion. The ginger tea should help too with that. Haven't thought wigs or hair pieces but i got a kickass black hat and added some bling this past week..and some scarves. I am practicing my tying skills. YouTube is great for scarf tying vids. Everyone has an iPad these days. I think i must be the only one who doesn't have one so thinking this might be time\u2026hehe. OK, enough rambling.. I have beef marrow bones defrosting for this weekend's stock activity. I thought it would be best to make it now because smells of beef roasting might not be great during chemo\u2026  xoxo to our November crew\u2026 <3 Bonnie ",

Now i see what they mean by Red devil drip! haha And check out the smile on the onc nurse too! Way to go yesterday and neulasta today. You are doing it! KnittingPT: I hope you are knitting cool caps for all of the crew here! I forgot to mention..you are in Tucson. My youngest son goes to U of AZ in his third year. ( I love visiting him there too. ) He loves school in Arizona..studying business/premed. wants to be an anesthesiologist. (I could have used him today in OR! haha) I was thinking about signing up for one of those classes too. Next one near me is Dec 13 in the morning. I prefer morning to evening sessions of anything anymore! I don't wear much makeup these days either, but when the hair goes it might be nice to accentuate some nice eyes and dig up the cool earrings in the jewelry vault upstairs. And bummer on the beer, but probably a good thing. I will miss my nightly wine (red or white, love em both) and beer with the right meal\u2026like beer, brats and sauerkraut which i love too. sigh Mrshq1: Police officer on the chemo beat?! Wow. I hope you are hanging well with work. I plan to work thru chemo too. Supportive folks here at work so am lucky. I was thinking about taking the same suppies you mentioned above. Still looking for some of them like the L-Glutamine\u2026wondering about the doses. Will clear it all with Dr and onc nurses first. Think i will make a list and run it by them. I'm sure they all get requests like that. BreatheInExhaleSlow: Wow! You are doing port placement and chemo in the same day! I hope all goes smoothly and well for you today. We are waiting for updates when you feel up to it. Erica, Looking forward to the vidblog! Hope all is well and ur feeling pretty good today. Everyone was talking about their pre-chemo meds\u2026let me go see what my prescription meds are: emla cream for port, EMEND, Compazine, and Dexamethasone. Geez, I never take meds\u2026 so this will be interesting. I love going the herb route or have been for a few years. I take the normal supplements like multi, omegas, d3 (mine was low), C buffered powder, Cal Mag.. Want to add Milk thistle maybe curcumin (i love using turmeric in cooking and have heard of recipes that use the fresh root like for tea. ) I have a holistic health care certification (CHHP) so love gravitating in that direction and combining east/west methods. (Hey, i am so chatty today\u2026) I agree with cc3373 that you are adorable in the pix! Liwi, the wig with open on top sounds great. I haven't decided if i want to do wig(s) or not but the extensions with hats or scarves would give many options i think. Got a bunch of fun scarves and some hats (winter and cold here in VA so it works to have hats at the moment.) Oh, and BTW\u2026.bald is beautiful! xoxo cc3373: Great collage! It took a while to figure out how to do pix easily here\u2026got it with the iPhone, just have to log in with iPhone then use the pix icon and not forget to save and it works. I wish i could do the collage. zuri43: Glad you joined our group. Bummer on the constipation and glad it is going ok. The prunes work well i think. I drank the 6 oz cans of prune juice after my breast surgery back in late september (two a day) and made a nice container of chia seed pudding with fresh almond milk and some added things like chopped walnuts, dates and stuff like that. After day two, bombs away and what a wonderful day it was! Cool on hubby wanting to shave your head. Mine will shave mine too. Heck, he said he might even shave his to so we can be twins! Thats a ways off though so we can plan the party. nitengirl1: great pix and looks like you have great support for your journey too. I think the port is the way to go. I have heard or read about so many veins being blown\u2026that the port is where its at with the chemo. My dr told me this morning that since my lumpectomy was on the left and a node was taken on the left that i should never ever have IV's go in on the left side forever. The pre op asked me about it this morning and i didn't know, so asked my surgeon before going in. Good thing because my champion veins are in my right arm! (whew!) RedHead01: Interesting about the Claritin. I have rarely taken claritin and have few allergies. Hoping to use my herbs and tea infusions to manage the nose drips. I agree completely that doing the preemptive strike on the mouthwash makes sense even before symptoms. Think about it\u2026the chemo will move around the body and come out in the obvious places, but also the less obvious ones like the mouth, nose..etc and our bodies are pulling out the immune reactive responses to manage the stuff that is going on right now. Sending hugs to the team\u2026<3 <3 Bonnie     ",

My chemo journey starts monday..so i am behind the november group and early in the Dec group. Lucy, thanks for sharing your experience and insights from it. It sounds like you both handled it very well. It reminds me of a client encounter back in the summer right after i got my diagnosis.. she answered the door (we have worked together for years) and she had no hair or very little. I asked her how she was and she told me her story about ovarian cancer. So we swapped stories and hugs and moved on. We have kindred spirits out there that come out from the most unexpected places. And it is a gift i think. Charlottesmommy, bummer on the coffee, tea, and liquids in general! I am not looking forward to my foodie tastebuds being violated by the SE of chemo! Ugh.. I read about a homemade electrolyte: 1 qt water + 1 tsp salt + tsp baking soda + 1 tsp lemon juice or something like that. I will find it and repost it here. Can't find it at the moment.

Hoping that herbal relaxing teas will help with the sleep times. I find that the support groups here are wonderful because they let you know you are not alone and we will all experience symptoms on that big list of SEs hopefully mild. As for local support, When I was first diagnosed and chose my medical practitioner team, they encouraged me to reach out and connect with the beast nurse navigators at the hospitals. They are smiling rays of sunshine that tell you its all going to be ok and have their own experiences to how you their proof too.

I don't want any of our chemo peeps to be in any pain through this journey and know that they are with others here who love and care for them too. xoxo Sheeba, Hugs and prayers for no pain or SE's from here on out. We are feeling for you now and hope all gets better soon. Dee, Sounds like you and I are on the same track. Still have my hair on day 9 but feeling some hair hurting\u2026just an early sign, but i have felt that before, especially when i wear hats all day like this time of year. I stopped at a cute shop this afternoon, kind of a women's cozy boutique set up in an old house and I bought a lovely hat and scarf. Thought a treat would be nice today. I think it will be nice for when the hair goes away. (building the options now..) thinking about all my chemo ladies every day. xoxo  bonnie",

I will be anxious to hear from the one nurses and dr on monday about managing SE with OTC drugs\u2026claritin etc. I think i outta put some on my shopping list along with L-Glutamine powder. I've been reading about that for mouth sores and ulcers further down in that system. Its a powder (an amino acid) that helps speed up repair of sores in the digestive system. It is usually a component of protein whey powders too. Tallie, I love the takes on wine! I was enjoying rum and eggnog last night\u2026kind of like a last boozy indulgence before chemo 1. haha Have a nice weekend..",

I like my port and am glad i got one put in. It is healing nicely. Does everyone with a port have the emla cream? That worked nicely for my first chemo so I will use it again. Didn't feel the needle stick\u2026well, only very minor but all was fine. YEsterday was day 4 post first chemo and I was very tired and mildly achey. I took a nap in the afternoon and slept like a bad dog last night. All good. It is weekend so will take it easy and rest. I noticed that i was not focused, especially when cooking. My husband noticed it too. He is very helpful and wants to be there to take up the slack for me thru this crazy journey. It is OK not to be yourself with all of this. Peter and I talked about the changes and I asked him to be patient with me. It is good to lay that stuff on the table. Everyone close to you is affected by what we are going through. Taste buds are blah. Boo hoo!",

I found that drinking prune juice twice a day (those little cans) works pretty well too and is all natural. Eating prunes as a snack works too. Drinking water is a must. Bone broths might help too with nourishment when you don't feel much like eating. Welcome to the club! ",

My surgeon is holding on the port surgery till by lumpectomy has healed further\u2026 I am in a holding pattern now and am anxious to get chemo going. It will be a dose dense 4 cycle regimen then taxol. Having a group here so we can share and support each other and cheer each other on is good for all of us. xoxo",
