    "Content": "Nov 12, 2010 08:20AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 06:09AM by BTJ I found out today that I have Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, with Associated Comedonecrosis, intermediate grade 2, Estrogen receptor positive, progesteron receptor negative.  My radiologist called and gave us his direct number in case we had questions.  I called the Breast Cancer Center at St. Lukes in Boise and they gave me the names of 3 surgeons. I called them, made an appointment for Tuesday for a consult and a Dec 6th surgical procedure.  My husband and I spoke with the radiologist several times, asking his opinion of the surgeons, the possible outcomes and also asked that he fax the report to me. I had it within 10 minutes.  I took a proactive approach and made the phone calls myself instead of waiting for my primary care doctor to get the report, review it and then have her refer me to a surgeon.  For some unknown reason I have a poweful feeling of calmness. That was my first reaction and then as I talked with friends about it I felt so out of control, but that has passed, for now anyway.and my calmness and optimism has returned.  For DMHO: Attitude is huge in any illness, so whatever you can do to find calm will help.  Yoga and meditation work well for me, as does visualization.. You can find some good visualizations online just by googling the word.  The unknown is so scary and the C word is the most frightening one I can think of right now.   I also find real peace when I walk through the forest...it is surrounded by nature that I can feel the rhythms of life and feel closest to the spirit of God.  I am sending you as much peace and calmness as I can.  Join me in making the conscious decision to be a survivor...We Will Survive!  Anyone else have any experience with DCIS with comedonecrosis?",
