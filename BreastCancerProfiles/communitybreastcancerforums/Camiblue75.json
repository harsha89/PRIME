They stopped after my second chemo. It came back with an angry vengeance July 2015. Regular periods every month ever since. My oncologist was surprised because I am 40 and have not had it for over a year. But yes it can happen",

When I was first diagnosed I remember physically shaking for weeks. When they did my ultrasound and biopsy they initially said I had five tumors. I was her2 positive as well. At the time of my mastectomy I actually had two tumors instead of 5. They were very close to each other with some benign cysts. That could be a possibility in your case as well. From what my doctor told me at the time, having multiple tumors does not mean that it could spread into your body any more than a single tumor. They count each tumor separately. They do not add the sizes together. In my case I had one 1.4 cm and another 1 cm tumor. Try to take it one day at a time. Sending warm thoughts your way",
