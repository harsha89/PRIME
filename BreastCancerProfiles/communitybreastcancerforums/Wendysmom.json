I also received the same results...sentinel nodes (6) looked negative during my mastectomy on Sept. 6, 2007. My surgeon gave me the thumbs up that I wouldn't need radiation or chemo., but she really shouldn't have gotten our hopes up because a more closer look, later on by a pathology lab, revealed a micrometatasis in one node.  I was bummed.  But if my cancer is on the move, I know that the chemo will go after it and stomp on it. So now, I'm resigned to the fact that I will be needing chemotherapy This week I have consultations with the two oncologists in our town to see what they recommend and I'll pick one of the two to set up a treatment schedule, etc. I'll let you know what the two oncologists say. I know it's not the outcome either of us wanted but for me, the chemotherapy seems like the next step toward recovering from this cancer.  (((hugs))) to you, Ann ",
