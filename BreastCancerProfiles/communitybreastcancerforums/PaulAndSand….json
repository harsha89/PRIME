While no one should purposely scare others into one treatment or another, this is also not a pep rally thread where only encouragement is given as the OP is asking for advice, not support. It is a personal decision and I think the OP genuinely wants to hear how others reached their own decision for inspiration or another point of view. My mother chose MX and was glad she did as it gave her 12 years of life with Stage IIIa IDC. In her case, with her staging and lymph node involvement, it was really the only choice the doctors recommended but still left it up to her to make.",

It's been a rollercoaster ride over the past 12 years and I have learned a LOT in that time from everyone, even going back to medical school for oncology at the suggestion of my mother's oncologists (I was told I knew more off the top of my head about very specific details of different chemos, treatments, mets, etc, than they knew and the way I discussed treatment options really helped them help my mom!) I promised my mom and her doctors I would do it and have been in medical school ever since. I'm glad we have a place like this for everyone to find info, share info, and give each other support. This disease makes me so angry sometimes because of what I see it doing to my mom and to all of you wonderful ladies. I'll be chiming in more now that I've temporarily moved in with my mom while she battles out this cancer. Unfortunately, she has deteriorated since November when she presented with large malignant pleural effusions around both lungs. The chemos have stopped working (we have our fingers crossed on the new Abraxane she's on) and she's beginning to lose hope... says she just needs to see a glimmer of hope somewhere and she hasn't seen it yet. I look forward to talking with you ladies more and wish all of you the very best! - Paul & Sandy (mom)",

My mother was diagnosed with Stage IIIA breast cancer in 2001 after noticing a very slight prickling sensation in her left breast. There was no lump, all of her mammograms came back normal every year, and even when they did the mammogram when she was diagnosed, it came back negative and the only reason they investigated further was because of the prickling sensation. By the time they finally saw it through more detailed scans, it was Stage IIIA with multiple node involvement. Sometimes no matter how proactive you are with self examinations and mammograms, these things can sneak up on you. With the constantly evolving treatments and drugs, there is more and more hope for people battling this disease. My mom went 8 years after her Stage 3A diagnosis before the cancer came back to the other breast and many other women have had even better outcomes with no recurrence or evidence of disease. I wish your mom the best... stay strong!",

Someone with a Stage I breast cancer has a very different cancer than someone with a Stage II cancer for example. Stage I means the cancer is smaller, less invasive, hasn't spread to lymph nodes (which increases the risk of it spreading to the other breast, surrounding tissue, or distant organs/bone) and is less likely to recur at a later time. Stage III breast cancers are more advanced, they've usually spread to the lymph nodes and need to be irradicated quicker and more agressively to reduce the chance of them coming back. Stage IV breast cancers have \"metastasized\" meaning they have spread to other parts of the body. This type of cancer is not curable but is treatable. Anyway, I hope this helps clear up some of the terminology in regards to the different stages and what they mean. This is obviously a very basic description--going into more detail really brings out just how confusing all of the stages are and what they mean. - Paul",

She was approved in August 2012, but they determined she was disabled from the lymphodema as of June 2009. They can only do back pay going back 12 months but at nearly $2k per month, she got a nice lump sum of $24k, plus $2k per month until she passed away last month. It definitely helped her financially and she didn't have to stress about not having money to enjoy the last year of her life. I talked her into applying because she kept saying, \"They're not going to approve me so I'm not going to waste our time filling out the forms.\" Thank God we did!

She didn't had too many SE's other than her blood counts dropped substantially to the point that she had to go from 3 weeks on, 1 week off, to 1 week on, 1 week off. Unfortunately, after 2 1/2 months on Abraxane, her counts dropped very low (WBC's were only 0.3 with the minimum being 3.0.) Her counts were fine before they gave her the chemo the last time but after a few days they must have dropped because she developed a mouth sore which turned into several mouth sores to the point she couldn't talk, all over the course of a couple days. They admitted her to the ER and gave her daily injections of Nupogen to try to boost the WBC's but unfortunately, even that didn't work. She passed away after 3 days in the hospital from sepsis caused by the low WBC's and subsequent mouth sores. I don't mean this to scare you but rather to make sure you know what to look out for in terms of SE's while taking this medication. Many women do completely fine with it, however, I have done a ton of research on this drug and have found many stories similar to my mom's so as with all chemo's be sure to watch out for any seriouis SE's and report them to your MO right away. In terms of the thoracentisis, I believe my mom had it performed 6 times total, each time draining close to a liter, sometimes more than a liter. I pushed the MO for a procedure called a PleurX which is where they insert a catheter into the pleural space and leave it there--you drain the fluid at home as the container fills up and it helps keep the fluid out of there. It also works (most of the time) to help close the pleural space by irritating the lining. This closing of the pleural space prevents further fluid from ever accumulating. They used to do a more invasive procedure called a pleurodesis wehich involved injected talc into the pleural space to cause the irritation and seal the space, however, that procedure is painful and was in-patient requiring sedation. The PleurX is as painless as a thoracentesis. Mom's MO was very conservative in his approach and wouldn't do the procedure (he thought the procedure could create a situation where an infection could occur) but be sure to mention it to your doctor and see what he/she says. It is only done if the pleural effusions become recurrent (more than 3.) Please let me know if you have any other questions about Abraxane, the SE's, or the pleural effusions and best of luck to you with the new treatment plan--hoping this one does the trick and beats it back! - Paul",

Unfortunately, I don't have a good feeling about it as the cancer isn't just in her bones and liver anymore, it spread to the fluid around her lungs back in October last year causing a bi-lateral malignant pleural effusion. From what I've read, 4-6 months is what to expect when it gets to that point and the fact that she hasn't responded to the Xeloda or Doxil since her Stage IV diagnosis last June makes me even more worried. She's on Abraxane right now but after the first infusion her WBC went from 4.1 to 1.3 and they didn't give her the next infusion this week. (She's supposed to be 3 weeks on, 1 week off.) So, now she's getting a Procrit shot for her red blood cells, Nupogen for her WBC and ANC and I guess we'll see what happens from here. I'm not going to mention any of these prognosis to her because I don't want to depress her anymore than she already is.

For example, my mother is talking about moving to Texas next year and then only having to see an onc \"every couple years for a tune-up.\" I don't think that's being very realistic when her cancer has spread to her bones, her liver, and most recently to the fluid around her lungs (bi-lateral malignant pleural effusion.) She is weak, has lost 40 lbs over the past 4 months, has been hospitalized 4 times over the past two months for infection and dehydration, her chemos have not been effective, and the latest chemo while we're not sure if it will work, is really bringing her counts down to levels that make her unable to receive her next chemo infusion as scheduled. I really want to sit her down and tell her about being more realistic about life, not planning things out so far in advance, enjoying the time she has NOW, and making sure her affairs are in order. Unfortunately, my father and brothers are siding with her and feeding into this mindset. It's as if if everyone is in denial about what's going on. What I fear is that she'll get really bad and die in the hospital instead of at home where she wants to because she won't even discuss the word \"hospice\" let alone agree to receive hospice care. I hear from a lot of women on here who are very open and realistic about their diagnosis, have all of their affairs in order, hospice lined up just in case it's needed, etc. I really wish my mother was like this but unfortunately she's always been the exact opposite, ignoring the suggestions of hospice and concealing symptoms to avoid having to admit there's a problem and in turn be admitted or even worse, be told the cancer is getting worse. Very frustrating experience for the caretaker, that's for sure. I hope she comes around and at least lets us help her get her affairs in order and ensure that she dies with dignity in the manner she wants to, at home.",

There are several others like Visteral and Buspar that are non-addictive and in my opinion, non-effective. To me, they were like taking skittles for anxiety. You have to find a good doctor who's willing to put your mental health above his/her insecurities with prescribing anything \"addictive.\" Too many doctors these days refuse to prescribe effective anxiety medications or pain medications because of how hard the government has been cracking down on them for it. This is mostly due to drug abusers making it hard for the rest of us to get the medications we need. To answer your question, since I have taken all three and am currently taking two: Ativan (lorazepam) works the best for me and I can still function with it. It lasts the longest though (4-5 hours) which I don't Iike. I would rather have it relieve the anxiety and then leave my system. Xanax (alprazolam) works very quickly and hits you like a brick. Wouldn't feel 100% safe driving on it, especially when first taking it or when when you already feel tired. It only lasts about 2 hours which is nice. Valium is the stronger of the three but only works for about an hour. Not a good idea to drive on this one. I would suggest looking into the Xanax. You'd probably have to take it at least an hour or so before you're going to drive but it does a good job and doesn't stay in your body making you feel too out of it for long. Definitely talk to a doctor about about the different options and if you have a doctor who straight up refuses to prescribe these medications because \"they're addictive,\" find a new doctor who will put your health before his/her insecurities.",

Whatever you choose, I wish you the very best with your journey and I hope you keep us posted and come back here to talk with everyone. This place is full of tons of wonderful women (and men!) that are in the same fight or helping someone who is. - Paul",

She was lucky in that her MO and his nurse were very well coordinated and worked out of a major cancer center in Cleveland, Ohio where literally every resource was at their disposal. Mom passed away last month on May 2nd at the hospital where she received her treatments and even up until her last day with us, her care was well coordinated. The only thing we had to do was to inform her MO and his staff of any complications, SE's, or other problems, and they would usually have us come in same day. So to answer the OP's question, if you don't feel you're getting the type of service you deserve, I would strongly consider talking to some other people in your area and see if you can't find a better match. Mom stuck with her MO for the full 12-years but my grandmother had to switch twice because of problems with coordination of care. Many of the men and women I've talked to about this have said the main reason they don't end up switching providers is that they're afraid something will get screwed up in the mix, paperwork will be lost, the new MO will take a totally different approach and the cancer will progress, etc. One of those, \"if it's not broke, don't fix it\" type things. Personally, I would switch in a heartbeat if I felt my care team was missing things or was treating me like a number.",

She did very well after her first diagnosis in 2001 but once it spread to her other organs, she only survived 11 months, 3 months after it spread to her lungs. I too would suggest spending as much time with her and your father as you can. The sock thing made me smile because I used to get my mom these warm fuzzy socks that she liked and when she couldn't walk anymore, would take her for drives through the park which she loved! She used to hike every day and missed being out in the wilderness. Another suggestion I would make is having your mom and dad fill out a \"story of my life\" type book... they sell them on Amazon and there are many to pick from... They are great because they are a workbook style format that your mom would fill out. Everything from her favorite colors and foods, memories from childhood, stories about how she met your father, childhood friends and so on. Unfortunately, my mom died before I had a chance for her to fill it out because she got too weak too quickly but we've been able to fill much of it out after she died thanks to family and friends. This would be a keepsake to pass onto your children. Wishing you, your mom, and your dad the very best as you fight this cancer! We're all here for you so feel free to ask anything you'd like. - Paul",

On one hand, if we ever want to find a cure or at least better treatments and drugs, we need to raise money. At the same time, I feel that a lot of the pink ribbon crap is just that: a commercialized joke. How many times do you go to the store now and half the boxes of foods have a pink ribbon on them, how many commercials on television somehow work in a pink ribbon, how many people who know next to nothing about what breast cancer is REALLY about have a faded pink ribbon magnet on the back of their car? To me it seems like it's become so commercialized. I don't donate to Komen, I don't donate to any of the big charities because there's too much overhead and not enough money going directly into research. Instead I donate to individual research projects. Over the years, I've been fortunate enough with the companies I have started that I've been able to donate tens of thousands of dollars to various research projects and will continue to do so even when my mother finally dies from this disease. I've even taken it a step further and started a project with my mom's help to SHOW what breast cancer really is. A pink ribbon doesn't show the monster that is breast cancer. It doesn't show the physical scars, the emotional scars, the fear, the hope, the worry, the peace, or any of the other feelings, emotions, and physical trauma associated with it. We're helping those battling breast cancer to SHOW what this disease is by having themselves photographed, scars and all, and writing a summary of what breast cancer has meant for them, how they deal with it, how they don't deal with it. These photographs and stories will be published in a book so that maybe it will give some support for those newly diagnosed or those who need something to help them relate with others in a similar situation. Well I'm ranting now so I'll stop. But that's my take on it.",

Have been on them for 6 years now, 4 times per day and they have controlled the pain, especially when used with Ibuprofin. My mother who is the one with the BC with mets to the bones, spine, liver, and lungs, takes half of one when the pain gets bad along with 600mg of Ibuprofen and she's fine with that. In terms of the Morphine, I had it right after my back injury and got the same sleepy feeling at first but after my body adjusted to it, much of the drowsiness went away and the pain was controlled. From what I was told by my neurosurgeon, until your body adjusts to the new medication, you can get some extreme drowsiness from it. I'm hoping they find a solution that works for you. Bone pain is unbearable, often times worse that severe tooth pain and always seems the hardest to manage. - Paul",

My mom chose a single mastectomy and then regretted it when the cancer came back to the other breast years later. She wished she would've done the bilateral mastectomy because it would have saved her life. The cancer that came back in the other breast was only Stage 2 but came back a year later as Stage 4. Unfortunately, she passed away last May from the cancer after battling it for nearly 12 years.  So I really think this is one of the biggest decisions you'll need to make and you may want to get a couple opinions, ask around on the forums, etc.  Wishing you the best with your treatment! ",

So much easier for labs, IV fluids, chemo, transfusions, IV meds and so on. She hated nothing more than the lab techs and nurses digging for a vein every week. I think a lot has to do with how well the port is implanted and the skill of the surgeon or physician's assistant who's performing the surgery. I've heard from many women who say the port was implanted on their left side--this is the wrong location but its easier (lazy) for the surgeon to place it there. It involves putting in more tubing which can ultimately make the port more uncomfortable.",

She went from fully independent to having me, her 31 year old son give her her daily showers, help her get dressed, clean her up when the chemo caused her to have an accident, and so forth. She was very opposed to it at first as would be expected, but started to become more comfortable as she needed me more. I thought it would create a weird awkwardness with my mom but in the end it helped create a special bond she would have never had with 3 sons and no daughters. Anyway, sorry for the rambling post, I just wanted to say how much this thread helped me understand how others are handling their treatments without a partner or children to help. All of your stories are very uplifting and you are all brave for being able to do this in a more independent fashion than others typically do.",
