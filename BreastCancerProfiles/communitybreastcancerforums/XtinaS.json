My only concern is that I have read that typically a mammo and ultrasound will not pick up IBC. I have yet to figure out what is going on with me and my symptoms but still have the pink rash on my chest and pain",

      "Content": "XtinaS wrote: it all started earlier this year when i found two red blotches on either side of my breasts. The blotchy areas formed in the same spot on both breasts which seemed odd. Earlier in the year I was having heart palpatations and my doctor ordered me to wear a heart monitor for a few weeks. Those blotches appeared pretty much where the stickers were from the monitor. Coincidence.. maybe. I thought maybe I somehow showed an allergic reaction to the stickers 2+ months later, although i went to the dr. My dr told me it seemed like an allergic reaction and to apply some cream and take some meds. I am not sure the meds did anything but overtime the blotches seemed to fade. Fast forward to now, in the past 2 weeks i found the blotches again but now can see a slight pink color in a few more places on both of my breasts. I have had lots of pain in and around the breast area, full body aches (legs and arms feel weak) very fatigued, recently started to have discomfort in my abdomen and lower back areas as well. Saw my gyno, he said it was strep presenting itself as a rash, gave my ammox. I went immediately from gis office to urgent care and got tested for strep, negative. Next say I saw a dermo who said it was nothing skin related and felt it was breast related. Also saw my PCP and she felt it was a virus that presented itself that way. Since I had IBC concerns she is sending me for a mammo/ultrasound which i go for today. In everything I have read I haven\u2019t heard much about people with IBC having all these symptoms but I can\u2019t stop to wonder if its just spread and that is why I feel terrible. I have two little boys and all i can think about is not being here for them. Would love thoughts in regards to everything. TYIA Log in to post a reply",
