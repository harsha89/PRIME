I just had a mastectomy done one week ago. I feel completely lost and alone in all of this. I am stage three with several questions still unanswered. I do know that I will get my port placed next Friday and chemo will start shortly thenafter. I am hoping this site will help us both as we begin our journey. All my best to you and I will be thinking of you, Tara.",
