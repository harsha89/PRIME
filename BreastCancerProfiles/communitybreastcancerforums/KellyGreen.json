Had a diagnostic mammo which showed calcifications. Because the radiologist is a friend of my DHs, he did a biopsy by Valentines Day and found DCIS. I had BMX on March 26th. And in the meantime I got a letter as a follow up to the mammo saying that they \"see an irregularity that they don't think is cancer but I should come back in 6 months for another\". So if not for our radiologist friend I would not have found this out for at least 6 months. So much has changed in the past two months!! And while I had no \"symptoms\" that lump sure didn't feel right. My husband and PCP couldn't even feel it; and the BS said the DCIS was microscopic and I shouldn't have been able to feel it. My DH is a PA and my mom, MIL and SIL are nurses so I've always been careful about not bringing up every ache and pain so as not to be a hypochondriac! But this was just different and I'm glad I immediately got it checked out!",

Then assuming a certain percentage of your weight is mineral (bone), it calculates the rest of your weight as fat. So if you had a significant amount of fat removed, calculating using your current weight, this would drag your fat percentage down. It sounds like you were lower average before and now you're a little lower average - but you're not in a range where you don't have enough \"essential\" fat or anything. I'm a dietitian, and when doing anthropometrics on clients with amputations, athletes, or pregnant women, we always have to make adjustments and can't compare them to the general population. So in your (our) case, our body composition is forever changed and we can only compare our numbers to our own histories. And for the record, those body fat analyzers are estimates anyway - there are more accurate ways to measure body composition that require special equipment and are more invasive. Hope this helps!",
