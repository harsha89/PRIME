I have rejected treatments with no or little OS benefit when the toxicity is more than I want to accept. This makes me reconsider.

I found it very hard to watch the female oncologist deliver the news to her patients, especially the older gentleman that had reached a point that he needed to enter hospice, most likely. Even though hard to watch, I agree with her style. Patients should be allowed to hope for the best, but should be prepared for the most likely outcome. As much as we'd like to think things have changed, for the most part, stage IV still means that it will most likely be the reason for our death. I cried in the segment about targeted treatments and how they haven't turned out to be the magic we hoped they would be, extending lives for a few months instead of lasting remissions. Although, I am hopeful, they can keep us around for the extra time needed to get to the next big thing in cancer research. Tempered optimism.  ",

I've had times where it steadily increased over a few weekS and later found it was due to progression of my bone mets. Other times, I have a flare for a few days, or a week. I think this might be due to my Xgeva shots that we have gone back to every 4 weeks, and when my calcium has been just barely enough. I don't take calcium as much as I should because it is constipating on top of the pain meds. This past week, I had a couple of mid day melt downs needing my pain meds. I usually take them around the clock. Then, out of the blue, a couple of days ago, I forgot to take one before bed and woke up the next morning feeling sorta ok. I still had pain, but I'd never get through the night normally. I've been able to cut back on the dose the last couple of days and I have no idea why. I'll take it!  ",

      "Content": "Dec 19, 2014 08:43AM - edited Dec 19, 2014 08:47AM by Romansma I like this post! Here are mine! 1. My kids! My 10 yr old son that has the biggest heart I've ever seen! I want him to have a childhood he can look back on and smile about. The rest of my kids are older but still need guidance as they explore becoming adults and all the wonder and scariness it entails. Would love to stick around for another wedding or maybe grand baby 2. My husband. He's my best friend and we just go together. Who else can make me feel like I'm 12 again without a worry in the world! Also, I'd be too darn jealous to think someone else would come in to take my place 3. My close friends. I feel so lucky to have friends that have lifted me up when I needed it, provided for me and my family when we couldn't, and just let go and act silly without the worry of judgement. It's the kind of close friends you have when you are young, but we aren't young anymore! 4. My community friends. They have been so giving. It brings me to tears thinking about how giving and generous they have been. I know they want the best for me and there are not many ways to express that. They have expressed it loud and clear with their generosity! 5. Travel. I have planned some trips over the next 6 months and I want to be able bodied to enjoy every minute!",

But that doesn't mean I should suffer. Neither should you. Be the squeaky wheel with your docs till they figured itout for your. Don't suffer!

One of the most common suggestions we (at Dana Farber) make for patients with initially hormone sensitive MBC who have had multiple lines of chemotherapy is to revisit the endocrine therapies, even in late stage disease. \u201cWe probably don\u2019t reintroduce endocrine therapy frequently enough.\u201d So what does the sequence of endocrine therapies look like in December 2013? For those patients who are endocrine naïve, or who\u2019ve had little endocrine therapy: if they\u2019re premenopausal, in the first line, it\u2019s a combination of ovarian function suppression and tamoxifen. If they\u2019re postmenopausal, I\u2019m intrigued by data suggesting that combination therapy works particularly well in patients who have not had prior therapy, so I look at that SWOG data and am tempted to use an aromatase inhibitor with fulvestrant. In the second line, if there has been treatment with prior tamoxifen and/or an AI, fulvestrant is indicated. In 3rd line, consider an AI + an mTOR inhibitor, and when that fails, progestins, estrogens, or move on to chemotherapy.\"",

However, it wasn't as balanced as I think it should have been. It gives the impression that chronic happens more often than not. There are a good percentage beating the odds, but that is still not the rule and I think the writer should have pointed that out. Those that live well beyond prognosis know they are in the minority. I guess my view is the realist showing through in me. ",

I feel more present with my family than I have in years. I may be completely ADD these days, but it's kinda weird and strangely fun to NOT be productive and organized all the time.My life before stage IV was very structured and left me so worn out at the end of the day that I found it difficult to be fully present with my family. So, I haven't finished the photo books, journals, and special gifts, but I know we are making some memories that will last a lifetime. My advice? Give yourself a break and just take each day as it comes.....and find something shiny to enjoy",

I wake up each morning looking for something to make my tail wag, even though I feel deep down that this disease is somewhere planning it's next attack on me. I guess I found out how much of a numbers gal I really am after I got knocked off my chair reading my path report. I know there's a good chance We nailed it, but for me, there's just as good a chance that we didn't. I live a healthy lifestyle, while still enjoying myself. I refuse to beat myself up about enjoying this life.......as long or short as it may be. I have fears too.....that my 8 year old son will have to grow up without me......that I won't get to be there when my 20 year old daughter gets married, or has my first grand baby......even, hating the thought of my husband getting close to some other woman after I'm gone. But, enjoying myself and my family is a win win in my book. If I'm around for all that stuff it will be something better than I can describe here with my words. If I'm not here, my family will have some really wonderful memories of our time together instead of remembering how mom was turned inward with fear. Let's not lie to ourselves about the anxiety that we feel and how it affects our loved ones. I, for one am trying to turn all that energy to more positive places, while I still can!",

For so many, it really is all about themselves. Maybe it's fear, maybe it's a need to be seen, maybe they have lost someone. My mother has regularly reminded me that I could never understand what it's like for her to face losing her daughter. Really? I am losing the opportunity to see my own daughter get married, to be there when my grand child is born, to be there when she needs me most. I am mourning these losses too, even though I will be the one leaving. But, someone who is too broken by the traumas of their own lives can't see that. They are in survival mode themselves, and it's all about them. By the way, remeber being told to take your medicine, it will make you feel better? That was a bowl full of bull",

I have little confidence in chemo for the long term and now it seems that targeted is falling to the same short term fix as chemo is.

Quality is very important to me. Afinitor was no walk in the park. I had awful mouth sores, ankle swelling, neuropathy, and more. But none of the effects went on forever, they would eventually resolve. I was on Afinitor for 10 months and it probably stopped working around month 7. I can't remember who asked about Xeloda, but I don't think it worked at all for me. My tumor markers have continued to rise. That said, I didn't give it much of a chance. I was on it for about 9 weeks before deciding the side effects were too much for me. Holly, I think choosing no treatment is a valid option that is not considered often enough. We all want to be in that elite club of exceptional responders, but many of us won't be lucky that way. Many of the drugs we take are only giving an extra 2-3 months overall survival benefit, if any at all. Weighed against side effects, it's not always worth it. Our doctors have these drugs as their main tool for treatment and won't usually mention no treatment as an option unless you bring it up. I have brought it up at a couple of junctures and been told it was a viable option considering my situations. ",

He seems to be in a hurry to go thru puberty and keeps asking when it will happen for him. Btw, he just turned 10.  He's really tall and I think he wants a deep voice to match his tallness.  Yesterday, he also asked when we should have 'the talk'.  He is the youngest of 5, and I think he wants to grow up a little faster because of all his older brothers and sisters.  I was happy he asked, because I LOVE being here for his milestones.  I got to tell him how I felt about certain things that don't come up in everyday conversations.  Birds and bees were all over the car!  He didn't say much, but I could tell the gears in his brain were working overtime.  Not only will he remember this 'talk' with his mom, but it opens up a conversation we can continue to have.  I thought I might have to write to him to share some of this with him because he wouldn't be ready for it before I'm gone.  We finished the day with some egg coloring.  Good day! My oldest son's grad announcements came yesterday.  I am jumping out of my skin excited for him to graduate.  We also met with the counselor at a tech school that he plans to attend before going on to college in the spring of next year.  We are working on a scholarship application.  I'm am so excited for him! My oldest daughter got some tough news this week.  She is 22.  She went in for a baseline mammogram to start the surveillance.  She has had a cyst that we have watched for a few years now. However, the ultrasound turned up 2 solid tumors, one in each breast.  It sent me into a spin.  Logically, they are more than likely benign.  But, it drove home how much stress this will be for her for decades to come.  The biopsies are scheduled for the end of the month. It's a bright, sunshiny, day and I intend to get out in it....dig in the dirt, and enjoy my yard.  The wild flowers are starting to bloom on my hillside (I cheated a little and threw seed on it about 6 weeks ago, but shhhhhhhh).",

On Friday I had a breakdown. I've had a progression and the fear has surfaced, big time. It made me realize that the day I have to explain to my kids that I will be leaving them is a bit closer. This is my biggest fear. Patty, I'm sorry you weren't able to have lunch with your son. We've talked about this before. For them, they just want us to be there. They aren't able to distinguish quality vs. quantity. As mothers, we walk a tight rope of concern with our quality of life, but at the same time, lengthening it to allow our kids to be a little older, a bit more mature when they ultimately deal with losing us. Give yourself a break and just go have lunch when you feel better. Kids are resilient. Don't beat yourself up. KJones....get someone over to help you! If not a paid service, a friend or relative. Don't feel guilty, just accept the help. It will lift the burden and you will be able to enjoy the holidays more  ",

It rained and the food was bad. BUT, it was awesome. 4 days of uninterrupted time to spend reconnecting and making memories. No electronics to distract, no friends to trump time with mom. We talked, played cards, laughed, ate, drank, and it was perfect. I purposefully scheduled this trip without my husband too. When we are together it tends to be us and them and a different dynamic. If you haven't done anything like this, I highly recommend!  ",

When they went to the playoffs, I threw caution to the wind and bought tickets for my son and I and we road tripped up to SF to see our team win the NLCS. Completely Amazing! Just me and my kiddos vacationed in Cabo last month. Just got back from a Mexico cruise with my lifelong girlfriends. Taking my youngest to Zion Natl Park and Grand Canyon next month. Alaska Cruise in June. Big Bear tomorrow! My list is growing every day. Having these experiences with my loved ones is keeping me alive, I'm sure of it!  ",

That said, I think all kids are different, and some may need to know earlier.  We all know our kids, and we are the best one to determine how much they can handle.  My older kids know, and they are doing well, but they need help processing too.  Both have had counseling.  I talk to them too, but not too much.  In little doses.  Then we get back to fun and life. I read The Fault in our Stars and I plan to go see the movie.  I'm not sure I'd want any of my kids to see it.  However, if they really wanted to see it, I don't think I'd stop them.  They'd really be curious if I tried to keep it from them.  Might make a good reason to talk about life, death, and all the good stuff in between.",

The table made noise as they moved it up and down for positioning. All I could think was how this must be exactly how it feels to be the subject of an Alien Abduction! Freaky.\"",

      "Content": "May 31, 2015 09:02AM - edited May 31, 2015 09:05AM by Romansma Good morning to you. I am so sorry you are feeling so hopeless. Some things about your post grabbed me. First, when you said your bone mets were visible on MRI only, I wondered if you had ILC. I checked your diagnosis, and yes, you do. I have ILC too, and MRI was the only way anything was visible in the beginning, and now, when things spread. That said, Petscans so light up for me now, but just the areas that have grown large enough to show in that mode. I say all this, because your tumor load may still be low if you are still only showing on MRI. That's good. Another thing, were they able to biopsy your liver tumors? I really think this is important because the biological markers may have changed from your original tumor. Bone mets aren't great for showing these changes. There have been numerous ladies on BCO that found out their ILC had become Her2 positive after spreading to soft tissue. This would be very important to know since there are very effective treatments for this. Teakie's experience with become NED is not all that uncommon. How great would that be to wake up one day and know you had beat this cancer bugger back? There are so many reasons to believe that you still have many years left. Your son still needs you and yes, he'd be fine without you, but he'd be so much better with you! My youngest son was 6 and had just started first grade when I was diagnosed with stage 3 ILC. My cancer returned in my bones when he was in 3rd grade. He just turned 11 and will start middle school next year. It has all been worth it. The older he gets, the better I feel that he will be able to deal with what life throws at him. He will also take a piece of me into his adult life and carry me with him. That gives me so much peace. Why bother? Because each day holds the promise that something very good could happen!",

As far as the WBCs...mine have gone from the 3.1 range to 1.6 on this last check. We expected them to stay low or even drop a little, but...... Didn't take anything to sleep last night (hate the SEs) and woke up at least 10 times during the night. Oh well, hopefully there will be time for a nap today. Hang in everyone!",

My RO is the one that told me to get the pads. Airing it out is good, but you can't walk around naked all the time......or maybe you can ;-) Today is my last one! Thank goodness! I am soooooooooo tired. Interrupting work every afternoon to go in and then sleeping through dinner and then staying up too late because I napped is getting really old! Cheers everyone!",
