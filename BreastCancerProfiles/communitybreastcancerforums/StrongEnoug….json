I'm ok with penciling on eyebrows if/when they fall out (I start TC chemo tomorrow), but my eyelashes will be a real loss for me. My BFF says I have a magical face b/c I can just put on mascara and it looks like I have my whole face done! I don't do it all that often, but if I'm going to lose my hair, I would like to be able to do something... What's the scoop on false eyelashes? I've never used them, so I'm totally ignorant on how they work. I've read through several pages here & see very little mention of false eyelashes, only one person I found, who said they didn't work for her. Any other experiences or info?",

No big deal so far, except I have a lingering cough from chemo and was afraid I wouldn't be able to go 10 min without coughing. Once I got in position & relaxed it was ok, just tried to gently clear my throat instead. The tech said if I coughed, the machine would stop & spit me out & then he could reset it to pick up where it left off & in I would go again. I'm getting IMRT, intensity modulated radiation therapy. Here's how it goes, I'm pretty sure: the table moves me into the tube for a short scan to be sure I'm in the correct position (after being lined up by 2 tattoos and a fortuitously positioned mole), then back out for a couple minutes. Then it moves me back in a little shallower and this is the actual treatment. I hear something whirring rhythmically as it moves all the way around the tube, stopping periodically at some points. While this thing is going around and around, I am moving further inside the tube, so slowly as to be imperceptible until I open my eyes and see I'm not where I was a few min ago. This takes about 10 min, then the table moves me back out of the tube and I'm done. Anybody else have this? The tech seems confident that I won't get red until 2-3 weeks in, and then we will switch to the 10 boost treatments to give my skin a rest, then go back to the whole breast treatments.",

Oh, and my hair is starting to grow back!  Finally, 7 weeks post final chemo, I have fine white fuzz and 5:00 shadow over most of my head. :)",

I'll ask about that today.  Yes, since I work from home, braless is an option for me most of the time, but I need them to wear to and from treatments and other times I go out, or if we're expecting company. Luckily, people usually call or text first! I'm expecting this to be a piece of cake, compared to chemo, but I'm not fully recovered from my last round yet (2 weeks ago tomorrow), so starting out already tired... I hope it gets better before it gets worse! ",

Also, it looks worse than it feels. It doesnt hurt at all, just itches like the dickens. The steroid cream helps a lot with the itching, but each sucssive treatment seems to make it a little worse. I had #18 today, and it's even redder now, and warm, but still doesn't hurt. Yikes1, I do have sensitive skin, and have had allergic dermatitis from fabric softener, hair conditioner, lotions, etc. We have been using unscented detergent and soap, natural, non-allergenic shampoo & lotions for the past 3 years or so, and I haven't had a reaction to anything I'm using now. I know that can change, but also, other sensitive areas that break out at the same time as my chest are clear now, so it has to be the radiation. Also, the doc said it was the radiation when it first started. I wonder about that sharp line also, but when my arms are up in the position the are in during treatments, the line is not so apparent. I have 2 more treatments this week, then the 4 day weekend to recover a little, I hope. No one has said anything about stopping or taking time off or anything. I see the RO again tomorrow.I just want to get this over with before Christmas!",

How long ago was your last chemo? I'm thinking I'm just not quite up to being up and out of the house every day quite yet, so feeling extra tired just from going to the clinic.
