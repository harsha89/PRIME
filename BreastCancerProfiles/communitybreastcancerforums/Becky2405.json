I laughed when she did the second view as I imagined the power going out and my breast would be stuck in that machine for hours. Strange I know. But a few days later I received a call from my pcp stating there is a small nodule and a possible spiculated lesion in the left breast. I need spot compressions and an ultrasound. I have them scheduled in about 3 weeks but I am very anxious about the word \"spiculated.\" Not a good word, although I am hanging on to \"possible.\" I haven't felt any specific lumps, I am lumpy and always have been. The only difference I have noticed is that my left breast is slightly larger than my right. I have never noticed that before until about a month ago. I didn't worry so much about that since I have put on a few pounds. Entering unchartered territory here. Log in to post a reply",

Dr. Google is a scary beast and painted the word \"spiculated\" as a certainty of cancer. I am still worried, my gynecologist and friend told me that it usually is not a good thing. But you are right, I should not jump to conclusions. I took your advice and canned some salsa after work today. Again thanks for reigning in my thoughts p.s. We have had a lot of thunderstorms lately followed by power outages. I guess that was where my mind led me as they had me by my breast!",
