I would have to have the lump removed and sent for a biopsy.  He told me to come back in two months, that was one month ago, the longest month of my life.  I am trying not to worry as I think all the signs are positive, but of course there is always the doubt.  Has this ever happened to anyone?

He explained that this was my first visit to see him and it was only a snapshot.  I explained that I had the lump for a number of months and nothing had changed and as the lump was going to be removed for testing please do it now.  He said he understood how I was feeling but said he wanted to wait.

I was told it was nothing to worry about and basically forget it!  So I did!  Then about six months ago I noticed the lump (if it is the same one) was still there but bigger and more easily felt.  I did not tell anyone not wanting to overreact, (plus my husband is a real worrier) but then I mentioned it to my sister who felt the lump and marched me straight to the Doctors who could feel the lump and within three days I had an appointment with a Breast Consultant.  Again I was sent for mammorgram and ultra sound and again nothing showed up.  I thought that would be the end of it, but no, the Consultant said that as he could feel the lump it would have to be taken out and tested, to come back in two months.  It is the two months bit that is driving me insane.  I will keep you posted as to how I get on.  I do realise that although the lump did not show it still could be cancer and I just want to find out what it is so I can deal with it.  I am so glad that you are now doing great, it must have been one hell of a journey.

      "Content": "Jan 13, 2012 01:21PM - edited Jan 13, 2012 01:22PM by SueJR Hi big,   Fantastic news!  I am so pleased for you!  After seeing the Consultant today, I am still playing the waiting game! He has said the lump has got to come out, the date is 8th Feb.  Like you I will have an exc.biopsy and  I am hoping it will also be fibrous fatty tissue.  My lump is quite big and I cannot understand why nothing has shown up. I am going to need all my friends for a bit longer yet.  Thank you all so much for being there! I suppose I am a bit scared (probably being a wimp!) about the biopsy, I know it will be done under general anaesthetic and I have been told threre will be about a 2\" scar,  and the dressing will be on for 10 days, so it looks like a few days off work at least.  I will then have to wait for the results probably about 1 week. I hate this waiting game. Andrea, Thank you for all your kind thoughts and please let me know how you get on. Leneza, How did you get on?  I have been thinking of you, I am praying you have good news!     Thinking of you all, and hoping for good news for everyone! Much love as always  Sue xxx",

I just want it to be all over and put it behind me.  I find it really helpful talking to everyone, it is what is getting me through this right now.  I do not want to talk to my family, I do not want to worry them. Thanks everyone Love & Hugs as always Sue",
