The doctors said the same - that this isn\u2019t normal; however, a nurse told me this happens more than one thinks. So, I ordered Miaderm with lidocaine from Amazon. Expensive, but the pain, swelling, and redness reduced extensively. I hope you find relief. I could not imagine going through this without Miaderm. It really saved my sanity. Wishing you well.",
