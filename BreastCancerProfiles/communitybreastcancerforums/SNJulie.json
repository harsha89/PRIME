I have really been numb...have been really grateful that it is not more serious, havent told a bunch of people and just moving through my days as normal. I have been unusually private about this and really kept all of it to myself and close family members. Today I have the radiation simulation and am experiencing a meltdown. I am scared for the first time and kinda overwhelmed with all of it. Has anyone experienced this delayed reaction and weird privacy stuff. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "SNJulie wrote: After approx. 1 week of radiation, I started to feel extreme tenderness in BOTH breasts. It is much worse when I go from lying down to standing up. I asked my rad. onc. if my hormones (I am premenopausal) could be effected by the radiation and he said NO! But, this pain has continued and I have been done with radiation for 2 weeks. I gotta think it is hormonal...did get a bit better right after my period...and is in both my breasts. In addition, I had night hot flashes before radiation and they disappeared during rads and have only returned a little bit since I finished rads. Or maybe it is a \"support\" issue. I had a rash under my rads breast which is not gone yet so I am not wearing a bra yet. Any ideas? Julie Log in to post a reply",
