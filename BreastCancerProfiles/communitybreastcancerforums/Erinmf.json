Well here it is 9 months later and I went back in and the doctor( Obgyn) said it had gotten bigger and longer. Because I have had no pain with it and it's not bothering me, she said I can leave it or have it removed, she said she wasn't concerned about it because she can move it around. My question is should I have it drained and tested or just leave it alone? Log in to post a reply",
