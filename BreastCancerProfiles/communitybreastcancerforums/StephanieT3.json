He said everything looked great and he started me on the Tamoxifen.Then today I got a call that my blood work came back with elevated liver enzymes and \"some other concerns\". I couldn't ask a bunch of questions because I was in the middle of a college tour with my daughter and I was really caught off guard. Anyway, they want me to come in and redo the blood work and I think they said something else. I'm freaking out and I don't want to tell my family until I can talk to the dr. I'm going in tomorrow, but I'm wondering if anyone else has had this happen.

I did more blood work yesterday and they just said my AST and ALT levels are still elevated. My dr wants me to have an ultrasound. Hopefully they will be able to schedule it tomorrow. I hate waiting! It's hard to accept this new way of life where you are constantly worrying about your next test results.",

They could have done it tomorrow morning, but I am scheduled to tour a college with my daughter and I've already rescheduled that visit twice because of other unexpected treatments. So I will hopefully know something on Monday. Your post does make me feel better. I guess I wouldn't have been so worried if my dr would have said it was ok to go ahead and remove my port, but the nurse told me he said we should wait and see how the ultrasound goes. I guess I am really going to have to work on being patient",
