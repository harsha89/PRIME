When I was there last Thursday she followed me out and told me that she had had a mastectomy 3 weeks ago and would be bald the next time I saw her. She had her first chemo treatment today, so please pray for her. She is such a precious person, and has been so good to all of us. It just broke my heart when I found this out. I'll ask how she is doing when I have my herceptin tomorrow. Girls, does it make you all sick to your stomachs when you hear someone has been diagonised with bc. I get physically sick every time I hear of it. Something has got to be done, there are just too many of us battling this beast. It has to be our environment. What are your thoughts on this?",

Bonny, you have had a week.....Have you ever heard that we take things out on the people we love the most?  I think this could be the case with your little Eric.  Remember, he is a teenager and it's their job to test the limits, hurt our feelings, and make us think that, we, as their parents are living in prehistoric times, and completely out of the loop.  Little do they know just how in the loop we are.  Glad things are going better for you and your youngest little duck.  Girlfriend, you have had a week!!!!  So happy that your Sunday sermon brought you comfort.  There is nothing like the power of prayer.  Look how far it's brought all of us.  I have always said a teenager will keep you on your knees.  Good news is, it does get better.  Our Adam was quite the handful growing up, but he is such a great person and has matured so much during the last few years.  By the way............HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY, BONNY!!!   Your husband is such a sweetie. Last week was a pretty hectic one for me.  I was in Knoxville two days in a roll.  Wednesday for a muga, Thursday for a fill.  Saturday Bobby bought me a new car, A white toyota limited 4 runner.  I Love It!!!!!   I'll be driving this one until the wheels fall off..........lol   Can't afford not to.  Oh yeah, and on Monday we stayed 3 hours after school for a work shop on teacher evaluation. Janet, are you all going through all these new evaluation processes?  Supposedly it has been handed down by the State.  Work, work, and more work.  Now, just when are we supposed to teach????  Just kidding, I don't think it's going to be all that bad, but at this point and time in my life anything extra seems significant. Ok, girls, I just got my 5th fill today.  I now have 500 cc's with three more to go, but this one has definitely been uncomfortable.  Hopefully this will subside in a couple of days.  If not I may stop before the 8th fill.  Dr. Chun told me that if I got in bad pain and stayed in pain for a week then I would probably be at my max for the fills.  So from now through the last three fills we will be taking it one week at a time, however he says I am expanding nicely.  And guess what else????  I can now wear a regular bra without any padding and look symetrical.  This is such a great feeling. Has anyone heard from Robin?  How is she doing and has she started her fills? Janie, thanks for the tid bit of info about coping and pasting to more easily access this site.  Now, to figure out how to copy and pace....LOL I'm definitely feeling fall in the air.  Wasn't today just perfect? Go Vols.....Love to all my sisters.  I bet I know where all of us will be on Saturday night.  Glued to our t.v.'s watching the BIG ORANGE as they take on the Gators in the swamp.  I love it when we beat Florida. Night girls, heading for bed,  I have early bus duty in the morning. Sherry",

Hope your test has turned out well.  We have had so much sickness in our family as of late.  My grandmother is now in the nursing home which breaks my heart, but she seems to be regaining her strength along with a more alert mind.  We haven't told her that she is in a nursing home, she thinks she is just in a different hospital.  I went Saturday and joined in on some of the activities they have her involved in, and we had quite the time.  Bobby's daddy is critical and I seriously doubt he will make it home from the hospital.  Bobby lost his mother just 14 months ago, and all of this is so difficult for him, not to mention what he has been through with me and my illness. Please pray that God strengthens him and gives him the grace and peace he needs to meet each day.  He is strong, and such a trooper, but when I see him cry it breaks my heart.  Girls, sometimes I don't know if I would reckonize normal if it jumped up and bit me on the rear.  Oh, by the way, I did an interview for the local paper about my experience with breast cancer.  As all of you know this is BC awareness month, so the paper contacted me Friday and wanted to do an interview.  I was caught totally off guard, didn't have any time to reflect or say anything really profound, but it's on the front page of The Middlesboro Daily News if you want to view it.  I think you can find at Middlesboro Daily News.com.  The paper is located in Ky.  We live right on the border.  They have a pic of me in the classroom with some of my 8th grade students, it's front page.....lol jankay, I live about an hour from Kingsport, maybe we can exchange numbers. Carol, and the rest of my sisters.  I hope this finds all of you well. Sisters Always Sherry",

As far as i'm concerned you have the most important job in the world. What could be more important than staying home, raising your boys, and being a loving wife and mother. I stayed home with my son until he started kindergarten. I was fortunate to do this, at times it was financially tough, but I wouldn't take anything for that time with him. Times are tough for us financially right now too, we definitely miss my added income, but there are things more important than extra money, like health and family. I was bad to spend mine on frivilous things anyway, things that don't seem nearly as important anymore. Bonny, we are rich and blessed with all the things that truely matter. I'm all teary now, just thinking about it. Good Night and Take Care.",
