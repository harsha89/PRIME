Because I had a low wbc I was using neupogen and I could not tell if my muscle and joint pain was from taxol or neupogen. Since completion of chemo my hands feel as though I was hammering nails for 8 hours. My fingers and hands are stiff and ache daily. Upon waking and getting out of bed my feet feel as though they are slapping on the floor and in the heel area it is as though the tendons and ligaments are tight and need to be stretched out. My legs and feet ache usually upon getting up from a seated position. Any one out there who knows how long this will go on? laurel",

After 1st taxol (5th) I ended doing a shot of neulasta because I would have needed at least 9 shots and I was going away. Going into 6th I was good and after the 7th taxol I ended up doing 7 neupogen shots again. The injections were all at 480cc I believe as my counts were always quite low. I had blood tests the day prior to chemo and they determined if and how many injections I would need. Both are very expensive. I hate needles so my hubby was the doctor and we did the injections in the evening about an 1 hour to 2 before bed. I found the neupogen shots easier to deal with as far as aches and pains and took ibuprofen if needed. My hips, back, and sternum got aches when the bone marrow was working. Nothing really bad. However, when I got the neulasta the same spots ached but sometimes it was a pain that would envelope me and I would stop in my tracks. I never got any colds, flu's etc and did not have to postpone any treatments. Hope I could help you out tc laurel",

I was on the taxol portion. They were having trouble finding a vein and ended up using the back side of my arm (between wrist and elbow). The cannula inserted without any problem and was into the infusion at 3 hours. The nurses were very good about checking and constantly going around the room monitoring. The longest was probably 10 minutes without someone looking at it. I got up to go to the washroom and looked at my arm and from mid bicep to about 3 inches above my wrist my arm was probably 3x the size it should have been. It was not itchy and I didn't feel any discomfort. The nurse calmly turned the pump off and said go to the washroom and we will fix it when you come back. Of course when I came back the big books were on their desk and their faces were anything but calm. They removed the iv and used my other arm for the remainder of the treatment. (I know I  know ) Ice was put on right away for as long as I could stand it and continued to do that for about a week. The pain was excruciating from the swelling and the heat and I could not put any pressure on the arm. I had 4 lesions about the size of  a 25 cent piece and they kept peeling ( though I had been burn't  on a hot oven). My arm gradually decreased to a normal size over 8 weeks. During those weeks the pain, burning, itching was off the charts. I took benedryl for the itching and used cortizone cream for topical. Was also taking decadron for allergic reactions to chemo.  My skin turned dark red (almost like a birth mark) and was like really rough sand paper for ages. Not a fun situation in an already crappy one. If you have any question don't hesitate to send me a private message. I was fortunate it was taxol and not the ac portion I was told.",

Mowed my lawn for the second time of the season and temps hit 72. I am sure there are girls out there that would just love to bop me for that comment. Artsee, I will try and figure out how to load a picture and send some. My apricot tree  has begun to bloom with many others plants budding as well. Can't wait for all the new smells. Went for a walk above our house over looking the valley and lots of cows with their white faced babies running around and millions of butter cups and violets. Donna lee, Nobleanna,Grannie Rose,   went for my first tx of taxol on friday with my sister and dx. Good thing they both went because they were company for each other. I would say I slept through most of the session. Which was alright. I don't have a port so the nurse tried 3 times to stick me (he was cute and very apologetic.). It is still a little sore and bruised today. I took an ativan before I got there and then kytril once I got in the chair.The injections of zanax, steroids and benedryl took about 45 minutes. Then came the special sauce. By then I was fighting to keep my eyes open. Didn't have any reactions what so ever. So started everything about 9 and was out by 2. A little wired at bedtime (10) and was told to take an ativan and slept until 7:30 am. I am taking dexamyathose 4 mg with breakfast and supper for 3 days post chemo. So tuesday with be in the dumps. My hubby didn't think I looked that great in the am  so said no running but we went for a walk. I took my neulast shot a 2 pm and so far just have a little soreness but nothing to warrent any drugs. For me I have still needed the stool stuff because of the kytil and am drinking lots of water. But over all just feeling tired and fingers a little puffy. Pam, you have to keep those nurses on there toes with a sense of humor but sometimes they just don't get it. I wore some scrubs and mouth mask on friday and asked which wanted to be my patient. No takers. Think of it now maybe that's why they couldn't find a vein. Aurora and Chris, I am looking forward to the day when I can say that was my last tx. I am sure we all are. For all of you I've missed, wishing you laughter and smiles take care , laurel",

The neulasta shot is an injection that some girls get a day after their chemo to increase white cell count to ward off infections. I take a neupojen injection for 7 days following my chemo (today on day 7 ) which is something along the same lines. I have lab tests the day prior to chemo and that is when onc determines how many days of neupojen I need. 40something, my hubby buzzed my hair yesterday and I did his and we both laughed. He looks like a pin head and just like I thought I'm all eyes and nose.  My waterworks seems to have a mind of its own crying at the most ridiculous things. One of them is I am 48 and never woken up during the night to pee even when I was pregnant. Never. Now I wake up at least 2x.

At least he was a cute nurse. The last three days I haven't been able to warm up and the normally huge veins I have went into hiding. All I can tell you is no se's the day of treatment. It took 45 min to drip steroids, benedryl and zantac. I was told the zantac works for nausea but allergic reaction as well. Then they started the Taxol which took a little over three hours. I did sleep the last hour and probably would have slept more if the jack hammers and other construction noise had eased.There was flood on the fourth floor. Shall let you know about the days to come.

My scalp was really sore on the 4th day after my first chemo of ac. Was cleaning the fridge and whacked my head on the handle so now I can't tell from which it is sore. Set me on my butt that did. At the base of my neck to where my vertabrae bumps start to just above between shoulder blades on different days has been really sore. Almost like I have slept with too many pillows. I was going to ask onc next week when I see him. I had my chemo on the 12th and am still dizzy at times but have low bp. I took the anti nausea meds as instructed and didn't have any problems but my stomach definitely has it's little quirks and seems to feel queasy quite easy. It is not fun but we can do it together. There is a wealth of information here so don't hesitate to ask. I am taking neupogen shots for 7 days which I think is along the neulasta line and was told that my chest and sternum area could be sore from the increase production of white cells. maybe. take care laurel",

Went to the radiation onc yesterday and am so excited. Sometimes it pays to be a member of the itty bitty t*tty club. Because I am so small I will only need 16 tx opposed to the original 30. It is good all around because it is an hour drive each way. Yahoo Susan,  I have always worked full time as my hubby is disabled, born and raised on a farm, middle child and have never been much of a lolly gaggler. Although I don't have the energy I normally do I still make myself wash cupboards and do things around the house along with my runs and eliptical. I find I do feel better once I get going and I think it helps me sleep better at night even if it is broken up. I have had 2 ac tx and found with each that I have less energy but am the little engine that can. Chris, I do hope things have worked themself out!! crazypam, wondered if a little sports drink for electrolytes would help. Hope you are feeling better. Bridget, whatever it takes to get you through the day laughter and smiles laurel",

Or that is the term they are using when chemo (in this case taxol) leaked into the tissue of my arm. There could be different reasons why it did that from the cannula poking through my vein farther down from entry point, to damaged veins, to a faulty cannula. They are always very cautious and checked every ten minutes during chemo but there it was. The onc says she has never seen it happen in the 10 years she been in the cancer clinic. My arm from elbow front and back to about three inches above the wrist tripled in size on the weekend with the swelling residing quite a bit now, but it goes from flaming red burning skin to insanely itching. You cannot really scratch because the skin is so sensitive and feeling bruised. Today is the first day I can lean my arm on a arm chair. There are dark spots about the size of a dime and am told they will probably blister. They said it could take weeks to settle down. So girls beware if you have your chemo via iv(cannula) and the alarm goes off on the pump, you feel anything odd like burning and itching holler asap. I have been going to the clinic everyday to ensure there is no infection. My last taxol they are talking about using my mast arm. Which scares me to death by the way. I am so ready to be done with this// laurel",

Best birthday present I could have got. Taxol is next. Donna lee, if you are iron defficient try dried apricot, molasses, folate rich foods like legumes and fortified cereal, nuts and seeds, dark leafy veg except spinich. Try to incorporate vit c foods at same time as they help in the absorption on iron. Use cast iron frying pans for cooking. foods to avoid are rhubard, spinach, chard, beets, chives, parsley and chocolate as they are high in oxalic acid which inhibits iron absorbtion. I have had trouble with anemia for years and since i was dx my iron has maintained the best ever. Go figure. Also my throat feels raw and when I run especially have tons of mucos. I asked the onc and she said it is one of those quick growing cells that are affected along with the hair etc with the chemo. I have had it for 2 tx now and I never get a cold just scratchy throat and runny nose I have eye lashes and eye brows but not much else. I went topless for the first time yesterday. (I forgot my hat) Got a few of those pathetic looks that drive me nuts. Well here goes and ac is done. Yippee. Half way there. Hope everyone has a wonderful day and are a little closer to spring.

Tummy a little rumbly once in awhile and that is it for upset. Definitely used stool softners or that would be something else. My head has  been fuzzy or a little dizzy with small headache this morning, kind of like a flu bug. I have been drinking lots of fluids, soups and solid foods and even went for an hour run yesterday.

About 15 miniute later I got up to go to the washroom and the nurse was going by and sound how long has your arm been like that, I looked down and it was swollen from mid arm to elbow all the way around. She stopped it right away, and I went to the washroom and went and sat down down again. She finally came back and after consultations with the head nurse they decided to go to my no  no arm. Second try got a vein and was finished in 35 min. They have never seen a needle do this and so I have about 50 ml's of pacitaxol in my arm tissue. They put ice on it right away and I have been doing this at home as well. they said no heat and not to use it.  My arm feels like it is swollen and about to pop. It feels very bruised although no discolor and my elbow aches. Has anyone had this happen to them and what was the outcome. i am to go back on monday and have it checked again but for right now am concerned about having chemical eating away at muscle tissue.
