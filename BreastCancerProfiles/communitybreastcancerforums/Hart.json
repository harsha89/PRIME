I'm just trying to keep busy till friday finally comes and then another waiting game will begin. I'm not sure how big mine has gotten, It was a grape to begin and now feels doubled. It's very easy to find and near the surface as well. When I had my ultra sound the tech was very friendly and told me about fibroadenom(I had already researched my brains out so I knew what she was talking about) Do you have any other symptoms that you know of or can remember? I remember in the past year I had a discharge from my nipple one day and never thought anything of it(I've never had kids, so no breastfeeding) That has me a bit alarmed. Best of luck to you and keep me posted and I'll do the same.",

      "Content": "Hart wrote: Hello, I'm new to this forum and just need some support as I'm very nervous. 5 months ago I noticed a grape sized lump in my right mid/lower breast. It's quite hard. I can't tell if it's moving or if it's just my breast tissue feeling squishy. sometimes it's tender, but most of the time it's not. I went and saw my doctor who sent me for an ultrasound a few days later. They said it was most likely Fibrodenoma and should go away with my next few menstrual cycles, but to keep an eye on any changes and come back if so. I just sort of left it alone for the past few months checking it every so often. Recently when I was doing a self exam I noticed it to feel quite a bit larger. I saw my doctor again yesterday who confirmed my thoughts and booked me an X-Ray for next friday. I'm 26 and don't have a history of breast cancer in my family. Anyone with a simular story or some insight. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

Although now I am booked on Monday for a core biopsy. boo! They are still saying 'fibroadenoma' but are doing the procedure to be safe. The lump on my right breast had indeed gotten larger and they found another smaller lump on my left breast that they will keep an eye on and not biopsy for now. Anyone with biopsy stories they feel like sharing? Now for more waiting...",

I first noticed the lump because it was quite tender. Currently it's uncomfortable to the touch, but I wouldn't say painful. I have this weird sensation that it's there. The outline of my breast/under armpit area is extremely tender to the touch though. Not sure if it's related. I honestly was confident this lump would disappear with my cycle. Pretty stressed I'm having to deal with this again. I'm really glad to have this forum for some female support!",
