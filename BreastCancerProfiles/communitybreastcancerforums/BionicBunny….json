Will be switching to a different chemo this Friday. But I have managed to keep moving, mostly time at the gym and some outside walks and bike rides. Squeezed in a very short ride on one of the local bike trails today and am planning on an early morning trip to the gym tomorrow. It is great to see so many posting on this thread. I really enjoy reading about all the different activities you are doing. What an amazing group of ladies you are! Teacher911-yes we made it to the Wonderful Run again this year. So glad you did too, and I loved the photo. What a fun time! And a springtime road trip sounds like a wonderful idea. Let's do it:)",

I have referred to your document several times since receiving it, and as a result talked to my doctor about getting more information about the ER status of the tumor that was removed from my hip. He had the tissue restained, which showed a 3% ER positive result. The original pathology report had simply stated ER negative. When you have triple negative, even a weak positive result is a good thing. I appreciate your time and diligence in sharing information through your document and posts. Thank you for all your hard work.",
