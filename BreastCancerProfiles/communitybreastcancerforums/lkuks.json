Early April my breast had a rash all over, almost like a very bad sunburn. I called my Dr and they sent me for a diag mamo and us thank GOD they ruled out IBC. The rash went away in about a week after using cortisone cream. As I am writing the rash is back about 4 days now. I did some research to try to figure out what this can be, now that my mind is free from IBC scare. I found Radiation recall, my symptoms are exactly as they say. It says its rare but It happens and it can happen years later and I'm at 7 years. It says nothing can be done but its very annoying. I will discuss this with my oncologist on my next appointment. If anyone else is going through this advice?",
