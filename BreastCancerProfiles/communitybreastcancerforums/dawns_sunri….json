That's a good reminder and one I've been working on getting figured out.  I still don't have that answer.  I do lean towards (I like you word, nicer than mine) hypervigilance, and I'm aware of that and try to fight it.  Again, thank you, it's something I need to hear. Okay, my appointment is tomorrow morning for the diagnostic mammogram.  Crazy to be feeling nervous because it won't tell me anything right away, but I am.  Just have to remember this is another step, and that I have my appointment to figure out the next step on Thursday. ",

I kinda understood that reasoning, but it's good to hear you explain it more. Cycle-path- yes,thank you.  That's what I'm trying to do.  I'm trying to sort through the millions of crazy thoughts and find the basics of them, the really important ones.  Sometimes it takes saying the same thing many times to the same or a few different people, but in the end if it gets me to where I have the questions to go for the answers I need, then it's worth it to me and hopefully anyone I make listen. ",
