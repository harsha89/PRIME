It has helped a lot, for me, and I am happy to think that it may help prevent a recurrence as well. I also wanted to put it out there that one factor that affects melatonin levels is how much sleep you get (many Americans don't get enough) and also how early you go to bed (earlier is better for melatonin levels)... there was a study of nurses that showed higher cancer rates in those who worked nights versus those who worked days, and there is thought that a difference in melatonin levels might be responsible. So, whether you take melatonin for sleep or not, going to bed early and getting enough sleep is key for cancer prevention and good health in general. Not always easy to do, but important.",

Sometimes I do just go ahead and wash my gauntlet when I am washing my hands, especially if it's hot and dry. But usually I either take my gauntlet off, hold it in my teeth (!) or stick it in my shirt, wash and dry my hands, put my gauntlet back on. I also have a sanitizer spray that doesn't contain alcohol; I think I got it at a health foods store, it contains something called Ingenium (TM) that is non-toxic to children but kills 99.99% of germs(?). Anyway, I don't know if it damages the material or not but I have been using it a lot and it's easy to just spray my fingers.  I also do wash my gauntlet (but not necessarily my sleeve) every day; I just wash it in the sink at bedtime and hang it to dry. It doesn't always dry by the next morning but now that I have two sets that's okay.   I was at MD Anderson this week and saw a lot more people than usual wearing masks. I developed the habit of sanitizing or washing my hands every time people were talking about swine flu; I washed about 50 times that day!  One thing I do in public restrooms is grab a paper towel before I turn off the water, use the towel to turn off the water so I'm not touching the dirty handle with my clean hand. I also use a towel to open the door when I leave. Of course, then I'm out in the world without a clean paper towel, and I do touch things, but I also have developed some little tricks to avoid getting germs on my hands: I push the elevator button with my elbow, and I use the hem of my shirt or my sleeve (if I'm wearing long sleeves) to open doors or flip switches.  I have a daughter in preschool and there's always something going around so I've had to be very careful of germs! I am going to check out the gloves, though. I got some grippy \"crafter's gloves\" for Christmas and I love them because they protect me from poking or cutting myself but I can still do all my little fiddly stuff.  good luck everyone!

I am so distracted by the ear infection I have at the same time that I didn't even think of cellulitis. Which now I am pretty sure is what I've got. And I've got an appointment with my GP this afternoon, and after I see them I can call the infectious disease doctor if I need to.  yes, this needs to be taken care of quickly. And I think I know which garment may have caused the problem so it's on its way out right now.  Thanks for bringing my attention back to the obvious. I am so busy trying to control everything I can that I sometimes forget there are things I can't! I'll let you know what happens. April in Texas",

I've been reading through here and I've got several of the sites open, so I'm really going to do it this time, but I'm just wondering.... do you wear the bracelet on the affected arm or on the good arm? Do you take it off at night/put it on in the morning over your sleeve/glove? I wear a watch on my good arm so I don't know how I could also wear a bracelet, but the other arm seems awkward. Also, I see that there are \"waterproof\" sports-type bracelets also: aren't the regular ones waterproof? Do you wear a different one for swimming/water sports?  I can't even believe how many questions I have about the BRACELET! I have just taken for granted my whole life that I get to choose my jewelry based on my preferences. I am hoping to learn some big spiritual lessons from living with all the restrictions of LE! thanks, April in Texas",

This stupid vest costs more than my wedding dress and has the complete opposite transformational effect. The fitter did offer the Bellisse but said that it was essential to wear prosthesis with it in order to get the correct compression. I may decide to wear prostheses someday but didn't want to be required to. Is the Wear Ease different in this way, or was the fitter wrong, or what do you think?  I will definitely be searching for other options; thanks for the link. Just don't know whether I should try to take this thing back and say, \"Are you kidding me? give me something better!\" or whether I should stick with the program and wear this while I figure out what else will work.  My mom ordered me a book about lymphedema and from what I can tell looking through it, it doesn't even mention truncal LE. I am finding this whole thing to be completely demoralizing and infuriating.  thanks so much for the response. Chocolate is definitely called for.  April ",
