    "Content": "Loomisgal wrote: one week out from 5-day treatment of external accelerated partial breast radiation and I have been slammed with severe exhaustion. I was fine the first couple of days. I can barely make it to the bathroom and it's been 3 days. My radiologist had said that most women get tired and may need a nap at the end of the day only. The pain in my breast ferls worse too. Has anyone experienced this kind of fatigue? I have to get back to teaching and I'm getting worried and depressed.
