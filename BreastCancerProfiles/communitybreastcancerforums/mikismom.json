I'm 32, with an 18 month old little girl. A bit scared. I am having a lump and a duct system removed under general anesthesia after a galactogram showed multiple filling defects. There will be methylene blue and wire localization first.  I've been bleeding from my left nipple on and off for 2 years. Kind of on pins and needles about the pathology report. Good luck to all the surgeries this month :) Be well everyone :) ",
