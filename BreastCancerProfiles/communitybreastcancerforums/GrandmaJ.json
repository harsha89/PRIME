He found a lump behind the nipple. I also felt it. He ordered an ultra sound which came back normal. I am waiting for the official results to be sent to him. In the meantime, i definitely have something in there that's causing pain. I have a history of breast cancer in my family, my mom and sister. I'm told that the next step is a diagnostic mammo. Does this sound right? Log in to post a reply",
