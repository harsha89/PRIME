I had a lumpectomy in Oct 2017, invasive ductal breast cancer, 17mm, grade 3, her2 positive, er positive. Had 9 lymph nodes removed which surgeon was sure had cancer, but they all came back clear of cancer. Finished chemo beginning of February 2018, 5 weeks in to radiotherapy quite burnt in armpit - swollen, numb and weeping slightly. Scar and immediate area red and swollen. Intramammary lymph node found swollen near operation scar and burn area. What could be causing please? TIA",
