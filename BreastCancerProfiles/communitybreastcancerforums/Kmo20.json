I was very worried about working (i have a full tim job and I teach a class at a university too) so I was trying to decide what to do about work. Luckily By the tim I begin Chemo I will almost be done with classes- and my other job, the managment is incredibly supportive so if I feel I need to take a day off here or there it should be fine. Anyways, Thank you ladies for sharing. I dont feel as anxious now- and I feel more prepared than just wondering what if. Of course the most anxiety I get is about loosing my hair. It seems some of you lost it- some thinned out- and some lost it after the first treatment. That makes it a little hard to plan for a wig. In that case- where you dont know if you will loose it or not what are your suggestions about a wig because if I start loosing it I want to damn well make sure i have a wig ready when i shave it off but I dont want to get one if I dont need it. Dilema!",
