I have received my report and was told to come back in 4 months for yet another mammo and ultrasound. my concern is that there is alot of stuff going on in my left breast according to the report, i have hadÂ no symptoms and have never felt any lumps, although the last couple days i have had some localized pain deep in my left breast, any way i dont know if i should wait or attempt to see another physician my report states the following multiple predominantly cystic nodules noted. largest measuring 15x16x7 mm in 10 oclock position, smaller 7x6x5 mm nodules. 6.5x3x3 mm nodule with echogenic center consistent with lymph node noted. of note is a 2.5x3.1 mm hypoechoic nodule. internal echoes are seen. small size difficult to further characterize. impression, multiple predominantly simple but also complex cysts and lymph nodes 4 month follow up to confirm stability bi-rads 3 probably benign finding anyone else out there with more junk in their breast than breast tissue?
