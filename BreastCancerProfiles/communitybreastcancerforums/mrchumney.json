I guess it is just typical to do both when the doctor finds a lump. However today, IÂ could see the ultrasound screen and I saw that we found nothing. Has anyone experienced where there was a lump found, but nothing showed on the ultrasound? Is that common to happen? Should I be taking this as a great sign or should I still be worried because I haven't got the mammogram results back. I felt great leaving the office today, but now am beginning to feel false hope and anxiety all over again. Michelle Log in to post a reply",
