Today, I went back to the doctor cause I had found a lump in my left breast and still have some discharge. They say it's not serious but they are checking to make sure that it's not cancer. When they took the lump out they had saw blood in it that scard them, they told me that its nothing to worry about. How can I stay calm when I still see discharge comming from both breast? Aymee",
