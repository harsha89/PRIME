YEA!) I am here because I found a lump in my breast about four weeks ago.  I decided to sit on it because I was due to have my period any day and wanted to make sure the two weren't coincidental.  Unfortunately it just continued to grow and become painful.  I saw my Dr. today who confirmed it (BOO! I was hoping it was just me! ;) and she said it was the size of a large grape.  Now I go in for an ultrasound tomorrow.  I am only 25 and have two little toddlers running around my house keeping me busy.  I know the chances of this being something non-cancerous, like a cyst, are greater than cancer, and I am really hoping that's all it is.  I just can't help but wonder if it's not though.  I am staying positive, but my nerves are really trying to get the best of me.  Waiting is so hard. I look forward to talking to you all, Amanda Log in to post a reply",
