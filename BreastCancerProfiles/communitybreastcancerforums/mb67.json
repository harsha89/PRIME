I took my films went to Dana Farber and they told me it had come back...Scheduled a mast. for the next month and here we are....healed and relieved! Good luck!",

I could not lift anything, not a gallon of milk until 5-6 weeks post op. You won't feel comfortable lifting anything. Of course this depends on what kind of recon. if any you are having. I am now eight weeks post op and finally feeling like my old self, but it was a HUGE surgery, a LONG recovery and I am still not completly healed, I am having problems with a slow healing wound. but that is for another board. Good luck and get as much help as you can, Show her before hand how to climb into her car seat make a game out of it. You probably won't be able to drive for a few weeks anyway. MB",
