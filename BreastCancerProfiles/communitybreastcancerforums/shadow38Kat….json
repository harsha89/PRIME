Thank you ALL for your warmth and kindness.  I feel much less alone right now.  Today, honestly, is worse than yesterday.  I guess when I'm actually doing something and not sitting around just thinking I'll be in better shape.  Right now all I want to do is curl up in a corner.  To be truthful, I hadn't had a mammo in 10 years.  I know it was stupid.  I'm stupid and I'm paying for it. I just want to get this OUT.  I'm still waiting to hear from my GP with the names of surgeons.  I want to make an appointment and start the ball rolling.  This waiting is sheer torture.  Dear Jill, Thank you so much for the explanation.  It's just so scary.  Not even sure of what questions to ask right now.  It's hard to understand how it can be invasive and in situ at the same time but I guess I'll be learning alot over the coming weeks and months.  Deanna, Thanks for \"checking on\" me.  I wish I could say I feel strong, but I don't.  Not at all.  I'm blessed with an amazing husband and he will be with me at all doctor appointments.  I also have a very close friend who is not shy about asking questions and although she works full time, if I need her to be with me, I'm sure she will be.  I know exactly what you're saying.  I don't remember half of what my GP told me last night.  I heard cancer and that was about it. ",
