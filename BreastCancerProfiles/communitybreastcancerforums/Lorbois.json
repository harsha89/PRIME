I cannot yet stretch my shoulder on that side fully. My breast feels hard and sometimes I think my flesh has been cooked, hence thickness! I still do not have sensation on top of the scar and under my arm (where 4 lymphnodes were removed). Sometimes I have pinching pains in the area of my scar and nipple(scar touching nipple). I hope your pain and mine eventually leaves yet I am soooooo thankful to be here, I do not mind the pain.",
