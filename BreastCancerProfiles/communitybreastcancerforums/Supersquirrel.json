    "Content": "Supersquirrel wrote: I have an extensive family history of breast cancer my mom, her mom and her mom all had it but I always though we were in the clear because my mom did not develop cancer until she was 71. Part of my PhD is in cancer biology but I didn\u2019t know the benefits of knowing aside from the Jolie approach which seemed extreme for me. As part of her treatment they recommended screening for a ton of cancer gene mutations. Well they found one and knowing it\u2019s a stop codon only makes things worse. I decided to be tested as well but just for the specific mutation my mom has. I also tested positive as of today. It sucks but hopefully I\u2019ll get the right preventive care now. Honestly I think it was worse when my mom found out than for me. She opted for the double mastectomy but unfortunately the cancer already spread. She is at stage four Log in to post a reply",
