I went to another 2 Gps at the time, who said the same that \"it was fine\" But one of them referred me to the breast clinic at the time,So at the breast clinic, the consultant there completely brushed me off and was basically telling me I was a waste of time and it was definetely benign, and laughed saying \"its NOT cancer\", He was really mad and said he doesnt know why people now a days dont believe him bt palpable examination. I was being fobbed off every where i went, so i went along with it and said they knew best,(which they do, I realise it is highly unlikely for someone my age to get breast cancer). When i was 22,I decided again for a second opinion, a new GP, He was nice and referred me for an ultrasound (finally)!!!, The radiologist told me it looked fine and was out of the area where cancer would normally be, he recommended Exision Biopsy, I was referred to a new consultant, she said again she was sure it was def fine and did a core needle biopsy, she totally treated me like a waste of time again, and totally advised against surgery, so i took the advice, (never happy, but too scared and when a million docs tell you your fine its reassurring and you are happy for a time). Got the results of core biopsy- It was fatty tissue???? So i went off with myself again (told always to come back if it gets bigger, it hasnt ever, i dont think). This year , a year and half after the core biopsy worry has crept up again, i have had an appointment at the breast clinic and requested lumpectomy, so i am on waiting list now . i have to say i am very worried now, Now i wish this had just been done 4-5 years ago origionally, It would have saved so much worry, but they were all telling me not to have surgery!!! Has anyone had a fatty tissue lump removed from their breast??? why is it there so long????  I have got it into my head now that it IS cancer, And I cant sleep with worry, I am waiting for surgery and cant wait but i am sooooooooooooo scared of the results. Sometimes i feel weird pain at the area? why is this? I hate that young people are brushed off. I should of been stronger before and asked for it o be removed earlier but i was made to feel i was a nuisence. Help some one please............... Log in to post a reply",
