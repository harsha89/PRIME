Thanks for starting this forum it has helped me make my decision to have ovary removed even if the insurance doesn't pay for it and with all the BC expense I can't really afford it.",

It is a bit uncomfortable to hold your arm above your head holding on to the bar but it is doable.  Once you start taking the treatments it only takes about 10 minutes for setup and treatment. Make sure when you go for your simulation that you wear clothes you don't mind getting stained with their permanent markers.  They mark you up pretty good while lining you up.  The markers gets all over your bra and clothing.  Also, get you some sports bras or bras with no under wires to wear while having the radiation treatments.  Your skin will begin to get sensitive so you do not want to have a tight fitting bra. Get 100% aloe vera gel.  I started using it a couple of weeks before I had radiation treatment to get my skin prepared.  They toughest part is the last couple of weeks.  Take good care of your skin and drink lots of water. ",
