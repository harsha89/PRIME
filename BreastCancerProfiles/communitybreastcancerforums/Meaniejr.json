    "Content": "Meaniejr wrote: I'll start w/some background history.  When my Mom was 50 she was diagnosed with Breast Cancer and had a mastectomy.  In August my 1 sister was diagnosed w/Invasive Lobular Cancer and had a bilateral surgery.  All types of cancer runs in my family.  Father died of Brain Cancer, his father died of stomach cancer, then Mom had it, eldest sister has skin cancer (and never laid out in the sun a day in her life), and now my 1 sister has breast cancer.  Leaving my brother and I the only ones w/out cancer.   I also should have mentioned that my Sister and my Mom were tested and they have BRCA 1 and 2.  So my geneticist decided that at this point it was unnecessary to test me. Well 5mths ago, I started have a pain on the right side of my right breast and towards my armpit.  I could feel a lump.  So after my sister was diagnosed w/breast cancer and went to an oncologist ASAP.  They sent me ASAP to a Mamo, ultrasound then biospy all w/in a time span of 3 days.  It turned out to be a fibroadenoma.  Great news.  However, the pain is still there at the site of the fibroadenoma and it has gotten a lot worse.  So painful to the touch and now the surrounding area  is also getting very sore and painful.  My oncologist sent me back in for another ultrasound yesterday and the radiologist said he didn't see anything abnormal and that he still only saw the fibroadenoma and nothing else odd.  However, while doing the ultrasound he quickly found out just how painful it really is to me!  As he was scanning the area, I just about jumped off the table in pain.  He was very surprised to see how really painful this was causing me and was unable to give me any insight as to why it would be so painful.  He said it doesn't make sense to him but the would sent the report onto my oncologist and let her make the decision. He said that the pain would probably just resolve itself.  Which doesn't make ANY sense to me since the pain just continues to get worse! I can't lay on my right side anymore, I can hardly wash that area b/c it hurts so much.  When the pain started out 5mths ago it was just a little discomfort, nothing really unless and really pushed hard on the nodule and even then it was just at a level of discomfort, not pain.  Over the mths is has really progressed into horrible pain that is 24/7.  Carrying groceries and even my purse hurts. I don't know what to think anymore.  I'm scared that there might be an underlying breast issue other than this Fibroadenoma.  Or might it just be that the Fibroadenoma itself is causing all this pain?  Does anyone have suggestions for me?  Or what this might be?  Thank you so much.
