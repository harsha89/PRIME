I am having trouble with raising my left arm and have some numbness from the shoulder to my hand and shooting pains at time from the SNB. That is the only problem I am having. The lumpectomy went fine and really did not hurt. But every woman is different. Some hurt, some don't!",

I have been trying to call my onc now for 2 days without any call back. I also have swelling above the incision for the SNB. It came up over night and looks about like someone injected fluid under the skin. It is about the size of a big gumball and tender and hurts. You would think they would call you back. So, I am now looking again! Hearing from others help a great deal. If you don't mind me asking, did you chose chem or what as part of your treatment? I have found out that I will not know my oncotype because nobody ordered done. Is this important to have?",

But the choice is yours alone. Good luck with your choice! ((((((hugs)))))",

I too did not really hear anything past the word \"Cancer\". It has been a month since they told me and I still am not sure I have cancer. Like this is a bad nightmare and I can't wake up! I have already had all test possible (not sure if I missed one) had the lumpectomy with SNB. I also had a mammosite inserted in my breast to recieved radiation for 5 day twice a day. This was very uncomfortable, mainly when they took it out (they put a dummy in first) then shove the real ting in (no pain meds involved) Like I like pain. Then after the rads to have it yanked out! OH BOY more pain! To only fiind out that they believe they got it it all, it showed good but slim margins. So, now at Stage 1, tumor 2.0cm, grade 2, T1C and they can't tell me my oncotype yet! Yea, I really don't trust anyone either. I feel this is all a guessing game. When you ask \"How do I know it is gone, that you got it all\" they answer, \"Well we will run an MRI, another mammo (like I need them smashed again right now) and another PET scan in a few weeks. But I need to decide what treatment I want to take. Pills for 5 years, or Pills and Chemo or do nothing. What am I paying these guys for?  We all feel very alone at times, very angry at times, and fustrated. But we keep holding our head high and do what we need to do to get the job done. Hand in there Jenny! I am so sorry that you are having to go through this. But we are al here to help and offer support when we can. ((((((((((((Jenny))))))))))))) hug to you and I will keep you in my prayers. Please come back often and keep us updated on yourself.",

After the shot took effect, all I felt was pressure. They took 8 samples in the right and 6 from the left. Went home with steri strips on both and a big bandage over that. Was told not to get it wet for 3 days. Kept ice packs on both due to the swelling for 4 days. Wore a sports bra for 2 weeks following. Scar, yes a small 1/4 in. on the right and the left was a little bigger but it was taken over by a much bigger scar now due the lumpectomy.",

Not sure what the steps are next, but I know that my energy level is getting very low. I have lost some weight and all I want to do is lay around. Is this normal, maybe just from the news I just got?
