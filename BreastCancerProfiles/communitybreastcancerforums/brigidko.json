I had my single mx on the left side on April 2nd. Everything went well; had clean margins and no lymph node involvement. I am ER/PR+ Her2- and do not have the BRAC genes. So, I am in this weird grey area now where the Drs aren't sure whether or not chemo will be beneficial.(I will be taking the 5yr course of Tomaxifen. Hoping I get into the OncoType test, to give me a little more to think on.I'm recovering well, trying to get my uscles stretched out and back in shape, and learning the joys of the tissue expander ;) And, thinking good thoughts for all of you going through this as well. Surgery will be fine, don't worry - the Doctors really will take good care of you!Â ",
