I'm also 35, am Norwegian, but live in the UK now. My tumour was 8.3cm. I also lost my mother to breast cancer when I was 18 and am so scared having watched her suffer so much. I don't have a BRCA mutation either - but they believe it is genetic, just one of the genes they haven't found yet. And your English is perfect!! Sorry to dash - thanks so much for my welcome - will write more over the next couple of days. Am off for my recon in the morning! x",

Largest tumour 8.3cm. I was shocked and appalled! Whenever they speak of breast cancer in the media wtc they talk of a pea-sized lump! Which must be less than 1cm. I've finished treatment now and do get really scared... Anyway, just wanted to introduce myself. X",
