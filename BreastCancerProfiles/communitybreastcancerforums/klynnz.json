I did it because my mom is stage 4 Mets to bone and brain. Prognosis 2 to 6 months. I'm older, but the memories I have of my mother will always be my precious gifts and NEVER burdens or sources of pain. I was blessed with the opportunity to make another amazing one this last week. Your love is their greatest blessing. Forgive me if I've offended you. You are in my prayers.",
