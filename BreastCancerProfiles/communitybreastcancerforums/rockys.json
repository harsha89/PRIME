Her husband is considering switching insurance carriers (from Aetna PPO to Healthnet -- we are in Arizona).  My understanding (my husband is an Internist) is that Healthnet is impossible to deal with and automatically rejects every reqest the first time out.  I want to sketch out for my brother-in-law in dollars and cents what cash costs would be (b/c if g-d forbid my sister-in-law were to needs tests, treatments, meds and the insurance company denied -- they would pay cash, up until what they could find the money for.   Can anyone help me figure out what the cash costs are for...   Tests (petscan, CT scan, etc.) Experimental drugs Other things that might come up   We pray (every day) that she does not have a recurrence but are aware of how serious her original cancer was.  Even if there is not recurrence, there will be scares (head ache, muscle ache, etc.) and I don't want her to loose the peace of mind of knowing she can get things checked out.   Also, if there is anyone who has been through treatment with Healthnet in Arizona, I would love to know your experience.   Thanks!!!!!   Raquel Log in to post a reply",
