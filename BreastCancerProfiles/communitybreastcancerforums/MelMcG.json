Again - hope all went well, and hoping for good results!",

I'm not sure how many cores were removed, but I do know they used an 8 gauge needle.  I also have very dense, fibrocystic breasts and the mammo showed a swelling on the right side (although they have nothing to compare it to since my baseline mammo was in May and the subsequent sets were only a couple weeks later and I don't believe there was additional swelling between those). Juliecc, I hope your pre-op went well.  I'd love to hear how your surgery goes - it sounds very similar to what is planned for me - wire plus excision.  Doc told me mine would be sedation not general, outpatient, and should only take about an hour.  My radial scar is very, very deep (the first biopsy caused a HUGE hematoma on the inner side of my breast even though they went in from the outside.  They biopsied two sites at the same time so I'm sure that didn't help.  They still may be able to do this one along my arreola as well.  I haven't scheduled yet but reading through these comments I am definitely leaning towards it.",
