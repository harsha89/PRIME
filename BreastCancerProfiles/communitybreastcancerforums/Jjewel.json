I was terrified about doing it, it was not easy but it does kill Cancer. I do think the best advice given to me was to stay positive, they have made such progress in breast cancer treatment, take one day at a time and get through what's right in front of you. Every time I looked ahead at all the things I could go through, I got really fearful. I finally came to the place of knowing all I could do is be as strong at the moment as I could muster. That being said I've had lots of meltdowns and that's ok. After you get going on chemo and better understand the routine, you'll adjust. Try not to think too far ahead. The plan is an outline and my doctors tweaked it as needed all along the way. This is a hard situation so love yourself and trust you'll do the best to improve today's prognosis. I'm rooting for you.....praying and wishing you good Progress as you proceed.   .",

We used to live in MN so I hope you're close to one of the amazing healthcare facilities MN has. As many have said before, they have made great strides in this area, try to stay positive. This battle can be so traumatizing in my opinion. You're on my heart, praying your doctors reassure you with their new plan. I'm 2 weeks out from surgery and finally feel much better. The last 2 of 4 drains were taken out yesterday, that really helped. I hadn't slept very well since the surgery. I couldn't even take Tylenol because my liver enzymes were up so I'm glad the pain and tightness seems to be fading. Hope to all going through this trying season, wehave to take it day by day......☺️",

They took 2 of my 4 drains out this morning. I'm moving around easier & lighter! I'd just make sure you have easy access to everything. It's hard to reach up in the cabinets with either arm. Everything is harder on the x-cancer side. They took out the sentinel and 3 other lymph nodes. I did direct to implant. The expanders may be more tender, I'm not sure. I hope all goes well. I'm relieved my surgery was not as hard as I imagined. You'll be happy this time next week to have it behind you!",

I was diagnosed last fall, had chemo first and surgery was on Monday, March 19th. I think I'm healing well and I'm thankful. The BS called yesterday and said I couldnt get better pathology report results. 0 Cancer in the lymph nodes (they took Sentinel and 3 others on the right side) and 0 in the breast tissue! For those going into chemo after surgery, the stuff works! My Oncologist said I had as many complications and severe SE as he's seen and yet I'm so thankful for the result. Be strong, chemo is hard but knowing what I do now, its worth it. I cringe saying it but it's true. For those who went direct to implant, are yours stiff and flat? I wanted to stay the same size, I was a 34C. They added 300cc silicone implants. They seem about right just a little flattened compared to what (the implant) I held in my hand. Heavier than natural breast. I think I read somewhere they will change and shape up. I lost my nipples but thank God I also have lost Cancer!!! So thankful...... Jenny",

Also for all of us recovering, I'm having a sleepless night as I struggle to get comfortable. I had 2 of my 4 drains taken out Monday. Hopefully the other 2 next Tuesday. It's been 10 days and my chest feels very tight and stiff. I had direct to implant after BMX. My Oncologist told me to stop taking all meds except antibiotic because my labs on Tuesday showed liver enzymes high from all the medications during and after surgery. Since about3 days after surgery I was taking Tylenol and a muscle relaxer for pain and tightness. Now I'm just trying to ignore it, it's not working, lol.",
