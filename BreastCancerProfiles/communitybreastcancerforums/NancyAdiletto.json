    "Content": "NancyAdiletto wrote: On 5/24, I had surgery to remove what was thought to be a fibroid cyst (close to surface). Afterwards, the surgeon infomed me that it was not what he expected and that the lab said it was cancerous. The full pathology will be available next Tuesday. This is all I know except that the doctor says I'll need chemo because of my age (42). Any insight as to how I proceed ? Is chemo usually brought up this early ? Thanks for any help.
