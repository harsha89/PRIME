I had a left modified radical masectomy with node removal 12 positive/20. Does that mean I had ALL nodes removed?? With a masectomy are muscles removed as well? When I looked at the pictures I couldn't tell.. Just trying to understand the how's and why's of my pain in and around my newly reconstructed breast. I also have the cording issue. If this is scar tissue, what happens to it when it goes away? Aren't these tendons or \"cords\" something you still need? With no lymph nodes how successful is the re-direction of lymph flow to other node sites. thanks for listening, I know knowledge is power and I am in need of a big dose right now.
