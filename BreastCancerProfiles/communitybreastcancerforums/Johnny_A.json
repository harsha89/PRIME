She recovered amazingly and recently just had her appointment with an oncologist to discuss treatment plan. It looks they are recommending chemo (Taxotere and Cytoxan) + radiation therapy 6 weeks after her 4 rounds of chemo. I've heard so many different stories of chemo and it all varies, but obviously my mom is nervous and considering just doing radiation. Is it worth getting a 2nd opinion? I feel like most doctors would say that chemo is something she should get given her diagnosis. For reference, they originally thought she had 2 tumors, one almost 5 cm and others were around 2-3 I think. Turned out they were connected and it was actually 10 cm! But I've heard this is not totally uncommon with ILC. Her pathology seemed good though, nodes were all negative and margins were clear. But stage is 3 because of the size of the tumor. She is getting a bone scan today, does anyone have experience/knowledge of having bone mets but with negative lymph nodes? Thanks everyone! J.",

I actually live in Canada so not sure if the NCI designation is applicable here? But thank you for sharing that link. The bone scan is my biggest worry right now, but will stay positive until we get the results. The cancer was deemed as pretty slow moving but was very large so who knows. Thanks again and I hope you are staying strong and fighting the good fight! J.",
