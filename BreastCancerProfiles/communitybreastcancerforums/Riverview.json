I just googled \"waiting for biopsy results\" within the time frame of 1 month and found this site. I love that the posts are current and relevant to 2012!Â  I feel like my life has been a comedy of errors lately. I went for my annual obgyn appt on February 22nd. My general breast exam was fine, my ovary had a giant mass and I also had a 10 inch fibroid on my uterus. Fast forward to the next week, I had mammogram that showed \"busy dense breasts\"so I had to make a follow up for another mammogram and utltrasound a week later. Inbetween that time frame I was referred to a gynecological oncologist for the ovarian mass. On March 7th I had a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Everything was benign...THANK GOD:) (I went into surgery not knowing if was cancer or not) 2 weeks after the hysterectomy I was back in for the breast ultrasound and 2nd mammogram.She found several area's that needed to be biopsied. So today, 5 weeks after the hysterectomy I had a \"bilateral ultrasound guided biopsy\" One breast was a fine needle aspiration...which appeared to dissolve the spot, and the other breast needed a core biopsy as the area appeared small, but solid. I told the radiologist I was only accepting good news. Time will tell...48-72 hours and I'll know. For now, I am sitting with ice packs in my sports bra. I'm going with the idea I am just a very cystic/lumpy kind of girl...and if everything was fine \"below\" it will be fine \"above\" Trying to stay positve and strong:) but I really need a vacation to Tahiti after all of this is over. Love and light to all xo",
