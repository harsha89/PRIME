I had my mastectomy on Feb. 3rd, 2017, I just had my 2 drains removed on Feb. 14th so I am still new and healing. But as of right now I do not regret my choice. My surgeon did leave me a little shelf as she calls it, extra skin so I'll have something for a bra to rest under to keep my bras from riding. I imagine I'll eventually get that removed so I am completely flat.",
