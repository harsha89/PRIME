My body needed to shut down and rest for two hours after work each day and I let it! Avoid getting sick by taking the anti nausea and vomiting meds BEFORE you get sick, on a regular schedule, and you will be good. Being single was hard when I had to lug out the garbage and clean cat litter :)  You can do it!!!",

I teach college, so it was a bit easier than a hard labor job. Just be sure to take your anti nausea and vomiting meds on a regular schedule BEFORE you even get sick. You can avoid it the entire time. The fatigue is great, but doable. I had the gene test on my tumor but to do that test you had to be ER+ and rest negative and I still had to have chemo to avoid recurrance. Starting radiation tomorrow. Good luck. Cindy ",

Would be nice to have a bite of it while we are frying under RAD!  I agree we will do anything to keep the monster away... during chemo I tried really hard to visualize the poison killing the evil cancer cells, but I always came back to the worry of it also killing good cells. Same with radiation. I, too, heard the fatigue will hit around the fourth week of treatments. I had serious fatigue, bone/muscle/nerve aches with chemo so I guess I will be used to it. Walking seems to help so far. I am glad to have all of these posts so I don't feel alone.",
