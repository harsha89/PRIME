My first was a lumpectomy with 10 nodes removed.  The margins weren't clear, but my nodes were.  I was back in for a second surgery 3 weeks later for a subcutaneous mastectomy.  Margins were clear that time. Then I had 4 rounds of TC. After the chemo, I was back in surgery for a third surgery for a full mastectomy.  I decided keeping a nipple wasn't worth the risk even though margins were clear.  I had invasive ductal cancer. I'll be in radiation in about 3 week or so for 6 weeks. Once I've healed from that, I'll be in my 4th surgery.  I'm having a mastectomy on the other breast (which is medically unnecessary, but psychologically and cosmetically to my benefit).  I'll also have tissue expanders put in at this point. My 5th surgery will be to replace the tissue expanders with implants.   My 6th surgery will be to have nipples put back on.  Yippee!  How exciting that will be! Of course, once I heal from that, I'll be back in for the colour. I was warned at the beginning of all this that it would be a long journey with many steps.  However, I'm looking forward to the big journey being so much longer - the journey we call life. God Bless.",

I went for my H1N1 shot yesterday and a woman there said she was diagnosed 6 years ago and told me that the tattoo in the center of the chest was painful.  I remember reading that here from someone as well.  I have 2 tattoos from year ago, and somehow I've not needed any pain medicine for the past 3 surgeries that I've had, and the nucular die injection didn't even hurt at all, so I guess I'll find out today about the radiation tattoos and let you know. I sure am looking forward to my next surgery once radiation is all done.  They're going to remove my left breast (which is completely healthy) to match the right side and put in tissue expanders.  I'll be even again and on the next step to having new boobies! I'm wondering how long most of you ladies who have had tissue expanders had to wait between radiation and having the tissue expanders put in?  Thanks everyone.  God bless.  xo",

As far as my hair, well most of it came out on day 17 of round 1, but not all of it.  I've lost a few strands slowly over the weeks since then, but always have some at the back.  I had my chemo every 3 weeks, and at just over 3 weeks after my last treatment, I had some hair coming back.  It's now been 6 weeks since my last treatment and I have about an inch or so of hair already and it's filling in every day.  It's very exciting, however my hair was down to my waist before chemo so it will take me a while before I get it all back again.  At least now I have the rest of my life. Again, I will say, that anyone about to get TC for their treatments, it's really not bad at all.  In fact, I felt great on my chemo treatments (other than day 4 where I felt a bit yukky), my allergies weren't irritating me, my skin was great, everyone said I was glowing.  Just make sure you get the Nupogen injections. God Bless.",

I also wanted to make a comment to some of the women who are having a hard time deciding whether or not to have treatment if it's offered as a choice.  My oncologist said I could turn it down if I really wanted to (I am cancer free as of my last surgery and my lymphs were clear), but she highly recommended I have the treatments to make sure I stay that way.  I'm 35.  I never had an oncotype test done.  I jumped at the offer to have chemo because this isn't something that I'd want to regret later on.  Especially because I have young kids who need me to be here for them.  What's a few days of not feeling great and a few month of growing hair back compared to seeing your own children smile every day and knowing you helped put the smile there.  It's no decission, it's living your life.  God bless.  xo",
