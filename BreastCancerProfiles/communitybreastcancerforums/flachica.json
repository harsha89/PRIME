I am a type A person, went to college, law school (put myself through - which was hard, given my financial means!). About 2 years before my diagnosis, I found that my husband, who I am still with, had been cheating on me for 2 years, including the year before we got married and the entire first year of our \"marriage.\" It was devastating and the hardest and worst thing, aside from present circumstances, that I've ever experienced. I decided to stay with him, and probably suppressed a lot of my anger, and my needs, and my feelings. I go to an energy healer, who has been tremendously helpful, and she said something similar to the other posters, that what we suppress can manifest itself in different ways. I certainly believe it.",

      "Content": "flachica wrote: Well, some of you great ladies here know my story.Â I had a great response to my first 3 TCH's (taxotere, carbo, herceptin) and had my PET scan. It showed everything in my liver gone except a 2 x 2cm spot, that had been 5x5cm. Nodes clear, breast tumor shrunk, metabolic activity greatly reduced. But, the scan also showed a new spot in liver (with a moderately high metabolic uptake), and a spot in the spine that hadn't been there. In the process of relaying this info, onc scared me more than half to death. Later scans to get onto a clinical trialÂ - well, a CT scan, showed NO new liver spot. Bone scan and skeletal survey showed NO spine spot (which is odd, because spine MRI - which doc had me do after suspicious PETÂ - did show a spot). Saw my doc at Mayo that I'd seenÂ prior for a second opinion,Â and he thought my onc should not have changed my treatment so fast....but my local onc did and I am on Xeloda/Tykerb. I'm mainly pissed because I am having more side effects on X/T than I did on TCH - imagine that :) I had none on TCH and it was more than a breeze. Long story short (or maybe not so short) I am just VERY upset at how my onc handled this whole situation. I liked him initially, he even went for residency at the same place my best friend is at currently. But the Mayo doctor thought maybe I should have been on TCH a little longer. Also, the info on the scans for the trial - my onc did not even tell me those results. I heard about the off handedly from his research nurse. Why couldn't he tell me?? I have since independently confirmed what she told me as I have gathered up all my records in preparation for moving oncs. This is what really pushed me over the edge. There is no reason he couldn't have told me those new results, which I feel are, given the prior PET and now change in treatment, pretty significant, if even from an information standpoint. I got in with Susan Minton at Moffitt in Tampa, where I live. I am excited about seeing her. I've heard good things about her - and apparently she usually only takes younger breast cancer patients, so that's good since I'm 30. Even though my soon to be fired onc is younger, I don't know that he's ever had a metastatic 30 yr old w/no family history. I think I freaked him out. So anyways - I am taking charge and firing him!! I do have one more appointment with him before I can get in to see Minton - but I actually changed to another doc in his practice (it is a multi office practice) because I really, really do not ever want to see him again. I am proud of myself. I hate conflict, but I couldn't take seeing this SOB again. I am curious to see what Dr. Minton will do w/me treatment wise. I am on a TDM-1 trial but NOT on the TDM arm, I am on the Xeloda/Tykerb arm. I don't know that I can continue the trial if I am not a patient at my current onc's office (which is one of the research sites).

      "Content": "flachica wrote: Hello ladies. I have great news!! Â Quick synopsis of my case is that I was dx/ed 12/21/09 with multiple liver lesions and 2 small breast tumors. ER/PR+ and very strongly HER2 +. I had three rounds of Taxotere, Carbo and Herceptin. Tolerated it very well. Had a PET scan 3/1. Onc said it showed progression - new spot in liver and a spot on my spine. He literally acted like I was dying the next day. Told me my ONLY choices were two trials, one of which is a TDM-1 trial in which I could get either TDM-1 or Tykerb/Xeloda. However, my Pet scan report said there was dramatic reduction in everything, breast and liver too. To get into the trial, I had to undergo a bunch of scans. Bone, CT scan, Brain MRI, the works - all done on 3/19, about 5 weeks after my last treatment of TCH (had to be off it for so long to start the trial) Â - I assume these scans went to the trial doctors and were never reviewed by my onc. Offhandedly, the research nurse helping me with the trial told me on the day I started (on Xeloda/Tykerb) that there was nothing new on my CT scan of my liver. Hmmmm, I thought. Why wouldn't my onc tell me that?? It has just dawned on me that he probably never saw that scan - it just went to the trial doctor, who presumably did not have access to, or at least did not compare, that 3/19/10 CT scan w/my very initial CT scan from December. Why he didn't see it, I'll never know. So, back in March, I was definitely not convinced that I had progression - I just couldn't believe it. Especially since the PET scan report had the words significant ALL over it. Tumor markers were completely normal then too. Second opinion Mayo clinic doc not convinced either - though I saw them before I had the CT scan to get onto the trial. So then I switch doctors in the practice I've been going to because I can't take Dr. Doom and Gloom. I haven't the time for such people. And I really wanted to get off the Xeloda/Tykerb because I hated the side effects. I switch over to Moffitt cancer center. Meet w/a Dr. Susan Minton last week. She had great things to say, wasn't convinced of progression based on the reports, but even she hadn't pulled up my scans yet because it apparently took a day or two to get them put into her computer system. She said we'd continue on the X/T. The very next day after I met w/Dr. Minton, her nurse calls, urgently, and says get off the Xeloda/Tykerb, immediately - - -we're putting you back on TCH. You had a fantastic response, and you need to be back on it. Cool, I think. That's really what I wanted all along, because I loooved TCH. No s/e's besides hair loss. I was thrilled that Dr. Minton took the time to look and compare my scans. I just KNEW I had a great response, and couldn't accept otherwise. She had me come in yesterday, and said, Flachica, you had a great, complete response to TCH. She was beyond impressed with the 3/19 CT scan. But, not only that, she said I had a phenomenal and incredible response, and that I am IN remission. She was frankly astonished. She told me my initial scans were, and not to scare me (hahaha), \"horrifying.\" Numerous lesions. A couple largish (5cm) ones. But now - there is NOTHING left in the liver. The breast tumors have melted away. She wants two more rounds of TCH to \"seal the deal\", then I am on to Herceptin every 3 weeks and a hormonal (Tamoxifen, perhaps, or depending on the status of my chemopause/ovaries, Femara). I pray it lasts forever. Remission in 3 rounds of TCH!!! I was not expecting this news yesterday, and it is hard to believe. These past 4 Â½ months have been beyond surreal. But I am thrilled, and wanted to share. Thanks for reading, and for your support. Blessings to all. Dx 12/21/2009, IDC, 1cm, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Of course, we stage iv gals also understand the added and horrible dimensions that this disease adds, but si was my saving grace. The first thing should be NC - no contact between your husband and the AP (affair partner). If they work together, this could be a problem, but may not be. The next thing should be transparency - your husband should be transparent in all things so that he can slowly build back trust with you. Counseling may also be helpful. I recommend also that you read Not Just Friends by Shirley Glass. It is a wonderful book and helped me a bunch. My heart goes out to you. What an awful position for you to be in. I am so so sorry.

      "Content": "flachica wrote: Hi all. I've been lurking here for a couple weeks. As you can see, I was recently diagnosed with mets - to the liver. In fact, I was diagnosed 4 days before Christmas - it was horrible. Just about a month after I turned 30 too! Found them innocently enough. Went to the dr complaining of some severe lower abdominal pain, and a bloated, heavy feeling. He ordered an ultrasound, thinking it was a gallbladder problem. The gallbladder was fine, but there were many (innumerable) lesion on the liver. Through a whirlwind and battery of tests, they found the primary - breast cancer, in my right breast. Actually, there were two tumors in my breast, one in front of the other, about 2 cm, and located a 3 o'clock - which I know is a weird place. Started treatment on 1/4 - taxotere, carboplatin and herceptin. These are good chemo drugs, right?? I have had pretty much zero side effects from the chemo, no fatigue, no nothing (though I did lose my hair) - lots of energy, I work, work out, even going on vacation for 5 days starting tomorrow. At dx, tumor markers were low - CAE was 1.4, and CA27.29 was 47. Both have dropped - the CAE from 1.4 to .7, and the CA27.29 to 44. Liver function tests have been and continue (as recently as two weeks ago when last tested) continue to be normal. I have a scan set for next Monday so I know that will be important. However, in the last couple days, I have had some pain in my right abdominal/rib cage area and I wanted to run it by you all to see what you thought. Prior to this, and by prior I mean maybe three weeks or so, I had a few tinges in the liver area. Told my onc, he didn't know what it could be. He didn't really say much, just sort of notated it. The tinges were very slight, but of course did catch my interest because of what all is going on in my liver. Anyways, back to recently. The pain is around the liver biopsy site - which isn't actually by the liver at all - it's about 2 inches lower. It hurts if I breathe really deep and sort of puff my chest out. Don't normally breathe like that, but have recently to sort of test what's going on. So I don't know if it's inflamed there or what. The other area is sort of on the side of my right rib cage - feels sort of dull achy/throbby every so often. I've read that when the chemo is doing its job, the tumors may actually hurt. Keep in mind, I have a bunch of lesions in my liver, and I never had these kind of feelings/tinges prior to a couple days ago. Any ideas?? Thanks in advance...It's just so hard not to freak out.Also, just wanted to introduce myself to you all. You all are amazing - and all are in my prayers.

Kind of felt like a stitch in your sideÂ - you know the kind you get if you exercise too long or too much? It started maybe Tuesday evening, after the day of my middling scan results. It was veryÂ uncomfortable. Radiated up to my shoulder too.Â Would hurt right above my right hip bone when I would breathe deeply. I'd been extremely anxious on Monday night (dreading scan result day and just had a feeling I would get not great news) - blood pressure was sky high, etc. Anyways, had a meeting at Moffitt on Thursday w/the clinical trials people and asked to meet w/a nurse. She seemed to think it was stress induced and sent me home w/a script for Ativan. The pain was not bad when I met w/her. Maybe a 4. I kind of agreed with her and I thought maybeÂ the painÂ was stress related, but it got markedly worse on Thursday night/Friday morning and so we went to the ER. It was so bad in my right side that I could only sleep on my right side, it hurt like hell to lay on my left side, and when I noticed it was really bad was when I tried to get back in our bed (it is high off the ground) by lifting up my right leg, I couldn't lift my right leg that high up at all. So, went to TGH, got right in. BP was sky high. Temp normal. They asked me a bunch of questions about my symptoms. I actually tried to go to Moffitt's hospital but they were full (I called beforehand) and I'm kind of glad I didn't, because at Tampa Gen, they really tried to figure out what the problem was and rule out a cause. I felt like at Moffitt they would've been, well, duh, you have tumors in your liver that's why!! But I wanted to make sure there was no acute liver issue causing my pain. There wasn't. Labs came back \"stone cold normal\" (ah, what sweet words), had a chest x ray, ultrasound and CT scan. Nothing revealed anything but the existing tumors (the largest is about 2cm x 1cmÂ - don't know how many there are, haven't asked. At dx there were \"innumerable\") and that there were in as benign locations as could be - i.e., not on ducts, or veins, or anything. So, the attending doctor concluded the pain must be because of the mets (makes sense) but that there was nothing acute. Now I had just had a scan on 1/31, but gosh, things can change in a couple weeks, right?? I feel relieved. I am a little peturbed that I have this pain now - it has really crowded into my denial and existence. I have had NO pain in my liver area since I was diagnosed - just some fleeting, weird sensations. UGH. I hope this pain goes away as suddenly as it appeared. It is for sure cramping my style. The ER doc sent me home w/some Oxycodone. it has helped a lot. I do think the Dilaudid they gave me at the hospital is still in my system, that stuff was awesome, made the pain go way, way down - the morphine they'd given me didn't touch it. So, anyways, that's my saga girls. Just wanted to share.Â  am much more comfortable now, pain is a 1 or a .5.

I've been having a few \"full\" type feelings - like I feel my liver is full, or sort of bulging, but it does not seem enlarged, i.e., can't feel it through my fat stomach or even if I lift my arm up and shove my fingers under my ribcage. When my onc felt it 3 weeks ago it was fine. Had my labs taken this week, they are all fine. My most recent scan (three weeks ago),Â while it showed regrowth, was not serious enough for onc to put me on chemo, put me on Tykerb, instead, you know - so I assume it showed nothing way out of whack on my liver. Keep in mind, I was obviously experiencing regrowth in August and September, yet never had any of the above symptoms. Additionally, last year while all this was obviously growing in me, never had a single twinge or symptom. Let me know what you think. I called my onc's office, but my normal nurse is gone. Someone covering for her listened to my message, called me back, had to leave me a msg and proceeded to talk about doing the BRAT diet, so clearly she didn't listen to y msg very well. My main nurse practitioner will be there on Monday, so I'll catch up with her then. Thanks ladies. Dx 12/21/2009, IDC, 1cm, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I found a lump in my breast about a year ago, went to my gynecologist who said I had fibrocystic disease. After feeling my left breast, and it felt similarly lumpy to my right, I agreed with her. I could swear I even felt it growing around that time of the month...more characteristics of fibrocystic disease. It never caused any pain. I never had ANY symptoms until.... around Christmas time I got the oddest spasm in my lower right abdomen. Not near the appendix. it was SO odd, I went to the doctor. I never, ever go to the doctor (well, minus the breast lump). She thought it was a gallbladder issue and got me in to get an ultrasound. I did. Gallbladder was fine. But the liver was notÂ  - -Â  it was mets. I had to have a liver biopsy to confirm. The biopsy was fine, the reasons behind getting it made it that much harder and I was a wreck. They had to pump me full of Xanax even before the procedure. I then got a mammogram to see where the mets in liver were coming from. My right breast. The same one I went to the gyn for. BUT- I had 2 lumps, including a larger one than the one I could feel - muc deeper in my breast. Now, imagine that I had pushed with my gyn, and gotten a mammo then. I probably never would have a PET scan...who knows. The liver stuff might have showed up if they did a chest CT, but who knows. Â I pray you have good results. I am dealing with this dx, but it sucks bigtime. I am very young (30), you sound fairly young too - let me know if you'd like to PM. By the way, that weird spasm that sent me to the doctor...has never reoccured and to this day, no one is sure what it was - wasn't the gallbladder, wasn't near the liver, wasn't my appendix. Good thing I went to the doctor.Â ",

      "Content": "flachica wrote: Have any of you encountered this and/or what are your thoughts?? Sorry this is so long. As I've posted before, I had a great response to my first 3 rounds of chemo after my diagnosis on 12/21/09. I was on TCH. Had two small breast masses, some node involvement (the lymph nodes in the middle of your chest, whatever those are called), and \"innumerable\" liver masses, of which the largest was a little over 5cm. After three rounds of TCH I had a PET scan. It showed dramatic drop in metabolic activity, breast mass shrank a lot, liver mass shrank by over half down to 2.2 cm, all other liver masses GONE. CA27.29 down to 25 from 47, CEA down to .7 from 1.4. BUT - I got a PET scan on 3/1, met w/my onc on 3/5 - the day I was to get 4th chemo treatment.Â The PET apparently showed new activity in my spine (L3) and a new spot on my liver. My onc acted as though it was literally the end of the world and said I had to change treatment. I felt totally doomed and desperate. He mentioned the TDM-1 trial to me, so I started prepping for that. In the meantime, he sent me for a lumbar spine MRI. I went to Mayo to see what they would say. My Mayo doc, whom I've seen once before, basically said, the spine spot was probably there all along and was missed by my original baseline PET taken in December, and that PETs can basically show false positives re the liver, and that my results were so good, it made him question the PET scan interpretation - that the two scenarios - my great response but also new spots - were almost irreconcilable. He also gave the very strong impression (though he did not say it) that he would not have switched my treatment up that fast. I should also mention, I tolerated TCH great and had almost zero side effects (other than hair loss!). Fast-forward to a week later - the lumbar spine MRI showed the new spine spot as extremely small. Supporting the Mayo doc's idea that maybe it was there all along. I then did all the tests required for the trial - brain MRI, another CT (with and without contrast) abdomen scan, echo, bone scan and skeletal survey. I was told by the research nurse that all those scans were \"fine\", i.e., showed nothing beyond what we know. Well, I was meeting w/the research nurse on Monday - first day of the TDM-1 trial (though I am not getting TDM-1, I am getting Tykerb/Xeloda) and she was giving me the pills and instructions. Offhandedly, she (not my DOC!!)Â mentioned that CT scan I had in conjunction w/trial prep showed NO NEW liver spot. I thought, huh, isn't that interesting. I haven't had a chance to ask my onc about it. I have already decided to change my onc, though, because I really didn't like the way he handled my treatment change - even before this very interesting news. So - why would a PET show a \"new\" liver spot but not the CT - which, by the way, was taken on March 19, more than a month after my last chemo - which was February 12? I should mention, the PET report did not even contain a measurement of this new liver spot - which I think is kind of sloppy, right?? It did show some hybermetabolic activity though. I am confused. At the very least, I am going to change oncs. With stage 4, treatment change is a part of life, I know, but I can't have my onc acting like it is literally the end of the world every time that happens - I can't psychologically take that. Not to mention, with this news about the CT scan, I am disappointed because maybe I AM supposed to be on TCH... Thoughts??

      "Content": "flachica wrote: ARgh ladies.... I really don't have a specific question, just writing to put it out there, see if you have any thoughts. As you all may know, I'm very young - just turned 31. I am an attorney (graduated from Harvard in 06). My husband and I have TWO homes. The one is our current home, and the other is our previous homestead, which we have not been able to sell. We have rented it for the past 3.5 years and recently started having lots of renter problems. After many months of late rent, and the associated distress (we NEED that rent to pay the mortgage, otherwise we don't have food, gas, discretionary income) we decided NOT to pay this past due date (11/1). We Â have only gotten part of rent, so it was the right decision. The other thing is that we have a 168K mortgage on it and the property appraiser valued it at $64,000 for purposes of our current tax year. And we have an adjustable rate mortgage that is going up in a year!! The house is never going to come back. It is a terrible investment. We really do need to get rid of it. Because we are now on the road to foreclosure, we are on the road to bankruptcy. We would have to do chapter 13 - that way, we can give back both houses. We have to give both back BECAUSE, if we reaffirmed our current house, and kept it, and then I pass either before the chapter 13 plan is done or even after - well, my husband makes a third of what I make and he couldn't keep the house and then he couldn't file bankruptcy either and it would be a mess. So I met w/a consumer bankruptcy attorney last night and she was very helpful. I understand that we could stop paying on our current house in a few months, save up some money, move someplace cheaper, do our chapter 13 plan - and because of our relatively high income we would be able to effectuate a plan paying all unsecureds in full in about 15 months, then we would be free and clear. Assuming I make it that long. So morbid, I know, but even though I got good scan results, I am cognizant of the fact that it will likely not always be this way, so I am trying to plan!!! Â Then we would be able to get off the restrictive budget they make you have in chapter 13 in about two years, we'd have a smaller home payment cause we'd be renting, and we would be debt-free. I guess that is attractive (minus the wreckage to our credit). Also, doing a chapter 13 makes it so that the minimal life insurance my husband would get from me would be protected as his income. If he waited to file bankruptcy until something happens to me, he'd only get $20,000 of it. So I am looking out for his future well-being and that of our dogs. If we move to a smaller house, with a smaller payment, and something happens to me, the life insurance will be able to supplement his income for about 4 years, he could stay in that place for the time being...so the dogs get some consistency and can all stay together (we have three and would need to move to a rental with a large-ish yard and a fence), and he would be able to modify the chapter 13 plan if something happens to me in the next year or so and probably get a discharge AND get to keep all my life insurance proceeds to supplement his income. It's just so scary because once we stop paying on our current house and prepare to move, we are committed to bankruptcy. But we really already are because of our other house. It's just scary because it seems like we are actually taking concrete steps acknowledging that I am sick. I guess I have been in denial! I also feel like a failure having to do this, but there is no other way - we HAVE to get rid of the houses. As optimistic as I'd like to be - I have liver involvement and aggressive cancer. I don't think I'll be around to pay this house off in 27 years. It just sucks. I wish we didn't have to plan this. We don't want to move either, we like our current house (but actually lots of bad stuff happened there - he cheated on me for a year and brought the other women there, and it is the house where we lived when I got this terrible diagnosis) - but part of doing this now is that I want to help Cory through the bankruptcy process and the moving processÂ  so he doesn't do it alone. But the reason we are doing it still just SUCKS. However, there is a good chance we do this, the plan, downsize, get rid of debt in about 2 years, and I am still around for 10-12 years, or even 5-7, in which case we really would've done a good thing by eliminating debt and downsizing to a smaller house and less debt service. It just sucks. It is overwhelming. I want a parent. I want someone to take care of ME instead of this other way around. I wish I didn't have to do this.

Obviously this is the biggest. What do you think about my onc changing my treatment right now - even after just 3 of 6 planned rounds of TCH?? Others on bcmets.org seem to think I should not switch yet. I'm so confused. Does everyone here have a good relationship w/their onc?? I think I do, but all he's ever done is give me bad news. This past Friday, w/the PET scan, his hands were shaking, the first thing he said was \"this was not what he had hoped for, this was a bad response\" I couldn't get any positivtiy out of him. Not even from all of the tumor marker droppage or other \"very significant reduction\" or \"resolution to background levels\" of the liver lesions. Is this normal??? I don't want him to sugarcoat it, but he didn't really give me any encouragement. He didn't even know that the trial he propositioned to me as randomized. It just seems like he has never dealt with a case like mine, and he seemed really shaken on Friday by it.... I just don't know what to think. I am going to go back to Mayo and see what they say. It's just so hard to calm down and NOT be discouraged. I was in a really good place, considering, up to Friday. Is there anything else anyone knows about TDM-1??? I need some hope here.",

Had a PET scan this past Monday. According to report - significant reduction in breast lesion (right), lymph nodes are now completely clear and significant reduction of large liver lesion (by over half), with others \"reduced or resolved to background levels.\" Tumor marker tests - have been halved, and are .4 for CEA and 25 for CA.27.29 BUTÂ - and here's the kicker -there is a new small lesion on the liver (dome area) and a small area on spine. I want to be happy about the significant reduction - which was, as the report stated, significant, but am quite understandably freaked by this other stuff. I know that chemo eventually stops working, or treatment needs to be switched - -- but I didn't think so soon!!! Was supposed to have 4th chemo today, but onc stopped and wants me to enroll in clinical randomized TDM-1 trial which means I guess I may get TDM, but may instead get Tykerb/Xeloda. It is randomized, so I do not know. I am freaked I didn't get chemo today. I did get Herceptin. Everything is just so scary. I realized switching was a possibility, but didn't think so soon. I think I am going to do clinical trial. Doc says Tykerb/Xeloda would be next step anyways. I am just so thrown for a loop. This was not on my radar at all. I am making another appt at Mayo-Jacksonville (went there for initial second opinion, said TCH was great combo. I thought so too!!!).

I think I've been helped by the fact that my husband gets it now too. Which sucks, but at least we're on the same page. Before this last scan, we were both relentlessly cheerful and upbeat, though of course, I knew (but didn't really accept) that this would be what does me in. He, on the other hand, would say stuff like, well, once we get it out of you, and shrunk down, it won't come backÂ - he said it seems so easy and simple. He didn't understand why I wouldn't join in his (misplaced) perception and optimism. I think he understands now though - that this is grave, and serious, and aggressive, and the magnitude of the sh***y cards I've (and we've all) been dealt. So it still sucks, but at least I know now that my partner understands the impact this is going to have on my mortality. ElaineD really hit it on the head. It's not just that this will kill me, it's that it will do so very, very prematurely. Which is the real rub. I am picking myself up again, and not waking up (so) glum in the mornings. It is just so hard. I felt SO great these last three months - went traveling, rockclimbing, worked like banshee as I am prone to do, was exercising....all the while, these insidious cells were *growing* I even felt a couple twinges around the liver - but because when I presented with this disease in December my \"l\" was riddled with mets, andÂ I had NEVER felt one single thing, I chalked these most recent twinges up to the medicine working. Guess that was not the case. I guess I feel betrayed (again) by my body. This is so insidious, and tricky. At least I've not had any major issues on the Tykerb - a few zits on my chin, the \"d\" on Saturday (right before my 5K race for Race for the Cure, naturally) but I took 3 immodium, and everything, ahem, has been normal since.

I was taking Tykerb/Xeloda (erroneously, it turns out, never needed to be switched from TCH - but that's another story!!). I started X/T on Monday evening, and, as I said, trots hit BAD on Friday afternoon. I did not have any immodium with me and was at work. I ended up having grade 3 diarrhea. It was pretty awful. I only got half way through my second cycle before I was switched back to TCH. The second cycle I was dose reduced to 2400 mg Xeloda and stayed on the normal dose of Tykerb. I had mild trots only, they started on the Tuesday after I started the second cycle the prior (i.e., not day before) Monday. Good luck!! I hear Tykerb is GREAT stuff. I also got some acne with it on my face, sides of my nose and chest. Like I'm 15 again!! It was annoying, but a small price if it shrinking mets. Best of luck to you.",

I think it was like 65 when I began and dropped to 55. You know what, I have never had my MUGA tested since. My current onc prefers not to unless I am symptomatic of something (i.e., short of breath or other symptoms caused by CHF or low EF) because I think her theory is that if my MUGA DOES come back low she would have to take me off Herceptin and she doesn't want to. I exercise and have never had a problem, and honestly, I don't know where my MUGA score is now. I assume it is ok. So a drop in the score does happen - luckily there is a medicine that helps AND I believe it is sometimes (generally??)Â reversible.",

I am in remission now and plan to be there a very long time. My onc at Mayo Clinic did mention Adriamycin and seemed to think it would be very, veryÂ effective for liver mets - I hope it will be effective for you! You don't see it a lot in the metastatic setting because for many women, their stage iv diagnosis is a recurrence, and they have already had A/C and there is a lifetime limit of the amount of A you can have. I am very early on into this journey. I was diagnosed a couple days before Christmas last year. It sucks, mentally and physically. I understand it can be very draining. The question of when enough is enough is a very personal one - and I understand wanting to maximize QOL. Very important at stage IV. I hope that the A is tolerable for you, and, most importantly, kicks the liver met(s) to the curb. Are you Her2+ - any chance of using Herceptin?",
