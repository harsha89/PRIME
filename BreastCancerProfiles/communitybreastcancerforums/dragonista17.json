    "Content": "dragonista17 wrote: Ugh! But glad I found this site recently. Had a surgical biopsy yesterday (couldn't do stereotactic due to neck issues). Microcalcifications, BI-RADS rating 4, no letter. There were only 2, but still classified as a cluster, in linear formation. I'm a nervous wreck, wondering how I've come to find myself here. Yesterday, while waiting for the radiologist to come into the room, I located all the on/off switches for all the machines, imagined turning them all off, turning off the lights, and vanishing! Yes, my sense of humor has gotten very weird from the anxiety. It was also the first time I cried since the extra screenings began. My bs will be phoning with the results, either tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. I realize in the scheme of things it's not such a long time, but it's really an eternity. I have another underlying medical issue which makes all this rather more complicated. Just trying to keep the anxiety down now. The usual distractions, meditating, etc only work for so long. Not ready to discuss much with anyone other than my husband, so thanks for having a place to allow me to vent. Trying hard not to catastrophize here.
