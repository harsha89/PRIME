I really like reading your posts. I asked my onc what my TMB was, and she acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. I told her what it meant, and she still didn't know. Wondering if I should be looking for another oncologist who does understand? I want to ensure I am being treated with the best, most advanced drugs out there, as I know all of us do. In your opinion, is there a better group of doctors who know more about metastatic disease? Thanks again for sharing your knowledge here.",

I live near the Univ. of PA, so a good second opinion is closeby I hope you and all of the ladies on this thread know how valuable sharing your experiences are to so many of us. I often wonder what women with MBC did before the internet?",
