The Breast Clinic is booked solid, unless I pay to go private (but dont have confidence there...ratger trusy the Breast Specialists). Im actuslly feeling ok. It is what it is. When I do go, I will be meeting with Breast Surgeon after all testing...one stop shop. Its a plus when I look at it that way.",

Last weekend my girlfriends daughter (23 yrs old) and her two young children were in a seriois car accident. Mom is still in a Coma with a brain injury..prognosis unknown. I said to my husband 'How can I be worried about something that may happen, when she and her family are going tnrough something that IS happening?' I thought to myself, there is no sense worrying whether I have cancer or not...but to embrace each day regardless.",

Still about 2 cm right beside nipple, but definately smaller than last week. My period has ended so that could be why, but I am a wee bit hopeful. Log in to post a reply",
