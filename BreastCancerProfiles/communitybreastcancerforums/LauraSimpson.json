    "Content": "LauraSimpson wrote: My family is celebrating life and that I'm one year from the original surgery by going to Hawaii this December. I made these plans but am now concerned that I may be setting myself up for Lymphedema by doing such a long first flight (7 hours) after bilateral mastectomies. I only had 6 lymph nodes removed on the right (affected side) and 3 on left (prophylactic). I did have some lymphedema concerns and swelling (mild) during healing process from my mastectomies but have no current issues. Any thoughts, concerns, helpful hints?
