I live in a rural area with little speciality services. I am having some problems with my arm. Pain at times asleep all the time .Ant crawling feeling and tightness at times. Slight swelling at times. I did get the doc to write an order for the sleeve .I use it to walk and do house work. But I am afraid that if it starts swelling big time I will not have anywhere to go for help. Just a little added note. I was suppose to return to work the 1st of the month. Well it seems now there is no position for me. I think it strange that it was all ok until I gave them the 20 lbs. weight limit for my right side from the Doc. There was no question before. I am a secretary with only occ. time that I would need to lift that much you would think since the office is full of people that I could be accommodated. Oh well God has bigger and better things for me. Elaine IDC ER+ PR + HR - Neg nodes Log in to post a reply",

Anyway I have called about getting into to see a lymphederm spec. Have not heard back yet .I am going to read all the stuff NPAT sent me. Thank You for caring enough to take time to do that. God does have angels here on earth. .I am still waiting to hear about my job but I have to send 1200 for insurance on friday and they will not tell me one way or the other . If I send the money and go back to work I bet it will be hard to get it back and that is a big chunk of change .lolo",

God has not ever let me down and He won't now. I thank you all for caring and for the advice .God bless you all .We will come through stonger, braver and smarter .I now pay more attention to the important things and don't sweat the small stuff.

They do not think it is related but sure is funny to me that they came up after my cancer . They have been basalÂ cell they say but one on my left side was really deep and came up fast . I also had one on my left and right chest above my breast. I am pretty sure another one is starting next to one that I had removed a few months ago. Yes I did love the sun but the places that have come up would have been covered up and my doc said they were in weird places if sun related. But they have been able to get clear margins every time.They did not go away and did not look like a rash more like a sore and they would bleed sometimes if I rubbed them with a towel after my shower.I bet yours is really some kind of rash. I have 3 family members with lupus and they have a butterfly rash on their face at times but it is both sides equal and more noticeable at times . Prayers are sent you way . Let us know what the dermatologist has to say. Elaine",
