I had arrived at the hospital at 7:30 for a 12:30 surgery that wasn't really happening until 1:30. I agree, waiting was a drag, especially with a headache. I had to ask for Tylenol, but it was still raging during wire guide placement and mammo, and through dye injection (ouch, ouch, ouch!) and pictures of tht. Finally I got some drugs from the nurse anesthetist! I was amazed at how well I felt on day 1 at home. 8 days later I have more fluid in the \"empty\" space than last week. My bruises are smaller and fading. My incisions are sensitive, though. I had no need for pain meds after the second night home. I'm warm and a bit swollen, but not feverish. Luckily, no problems with arms, and the surgeon took out 12 nodes. The best thing? All nodes were negative for cancer. Good luck with your pathology report!",

I am lucky my doctor got to within 1.8 mm on the closest side to my DCIS, 1 cm on closest side to my IDC tumor. Why couldn't you do the MRI? It will provide more information about the other side that may help with your surgical decisions. ",

No real pain-just some tenderness right on the stitches and at the lump site. Some nipple sensitivity where I had the dye injected for the SNB--would like that to go away--expecting it will. It is hard for me to remember to take it easy on my affected arm since it feels so normal. I don't want LE, but I also like being able to do normal things. It's hard to know where to draw the line, exactly. Today I am getting my chemo plan since I finally found out I am really a HER2+. A let-down, for sure, but everyone says chemo/Herceptin are so doable. So I will do it! Time to think about wigs, I guess....",

However, if it had been a tiny tumor I would have wanted to know. It might have changed my treatment decisions. We are going to be all right! You'll know a lot more after the pathology from the biopsy comes back. Surgery was where my BS decided how many nodes needed to be checked and the pathology from surgery gives the final result on nodes. ",

I notice no lingering effects from BC except a PT told me Tamoxifen is partly to blame for my lack of muscle tone in my therapy for stress incontinence when I cough or jog. I'm doing Kegels and getting stronger in my core. I'm thinking of getting my counselor license and focusing on cancer patients. I have 2 classes to take before I can take a certifying test. I used to be a therapist in Michigan. Now I'm in Illinois. I'm thinking about a training I went to: Meaning Centered Psychotherapy. There are many ways to find joy: family, work, art, legacies.

I'm on Tamoxifen now and have no problems with it. I am getting hair back and have started to go to the doctor and treatments without a wig. It is so short--about 3/4 inch. Grateful for my lumpectomy but eager to be done with Rads. Will continue with Herceptin until October, every 3 weeks. What a lot of treatment for stage 1. However, I was \"lucky\", and couldn't tolerate the Taxotere/Cytoxan past one cycle (due to allergic reaction), so got Navelbine for the last 9 weeks of chemo. It wasn't so bad.  Eema, sorry about this complication you have to deal with!  I've lost 5 of the 10 pounds I gained and am looking forward to spring exercise. ",

I have no side effects to Tamoxifen. One year left to go on that and it's only 4 months until the 5 years post surgery mark. This year I experienced cording in my arm. I've had it twice in the last couple of years, and I just massage it. I haven't needed to get physical therapy. I have some throbbing feelings at my surgical site. My last mammo was clear, but there is a lump of what my onc says is scar tissue. I'm thinking about going to my surgeon to see what she thinks. I also had my blood drawn to see if I'm pre- or post-menopausal. I don't think my doc will switch me from Tamoxifen to an aromatase inhibitor at this late date, but she always asks.

I did not get Neupogen with Navelbine as I did with Taxotere. Other than napping a lot, I didn't have side effects I noticed. I did not get sick during that time. My hair fell out in October from Taxotere and then started growing back with Navelbine. I just started going with no wig yesterday!! I think this is a common drug for late stage or mets. There is little data on using it with Stage 1, HER2 + like me. Anyone else early stage with Navelbine??",

I waited to tell my elderly parents and kids because I didn't want them to worry too much when there were more questions than answers. But when the diagnosis was bc I told them along with a lot of other family and several friends. I am glad since I am receiving support and they feel glad that they can help/listen/support, each in their own way. It's helping. However, there are some people I don't want to talk with about this at all or very much, and I've decided that's just fine! ",

And I should take it easier because too much activity causes more fluid leaking into the cavity. Interesting. So I wrote thank-you notes for flowers and meals instead of washing pots and pans!",

The excised tissue was about 6 cm. So it makes sense to me that healing is going on! I have no fever or redness, but feel a bit more tender than a week ago, when I had surgery. My gut instinct is that I'm healing, I think.... I had worse fever and redness from mastitis when I was breastfeeding! So I will watch it and call the surgeon if I don't feel well. In the meantime, I'm comfortably warm .",
