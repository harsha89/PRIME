But my family was well-behaved and thoughtful this year, and for that I'm grateful. Though I agree with you, Mrs. M, that it is great to come here where there is a depth of understanding that is sometimes missing \"out there.\" Congratulations on your decision to stop working. It must be very liberating and a little sad, too. I hope the new chapter is a good one for you. ",

I asked if we could watch something else. We did. Later, I agreed to try again. I found the episode didn't bother me anymore, and I even laughed at some of the cancer clich√©s. I'm trying to say, you don't have to watch the show with your SO, or if you do, you two could save it for a future time when it doesn't bother you. Also, it's just a show, and your feelings are (or should be) more important to your SO than any television show could ever be. Give him a chance to prove it, and tell him how it makes you sad. You can and will get over your feelings about the show, but you can and should share your feelings with your partner. That's my take, anyway.",

If you are having trust issues with your doctor, they will not resolve on their own. Getting a new one is best, if you can. If not, maybe a frank talk with the one you have. You are a medical professional yourself, and that must give you some insight into the medical world and the way things are done. You have to put aside your fear to do that, though. It helps to take some kind of action. Exercise, and read all about your kind of cancer. Start researching ways to improve your overall health. If you can stand needles, acupuncture is a good way to get rid of anxiety, insomnia, aches and pains and other things that interfere with well-being and calm.

It's very scary and surreal, and I blanked out a lot at first. Your oncologist will help you decide on a treatment plan. Everyone's different and (as my doctor says \"Not every cancer has read the rule book\") so it's hard to say what's next for you, or even what's common. A lot depends on what kind of treatments you've had already and what your hormone receptor status is. If those spots on your lung are cancer from your original disease, then you have metastatic breast cancer. You don't get to be fixed now, but you could be symptom-free for a long time, if your treatments are effective. The closest we get to cured in the MBC world is something called NED, No Evidence of Disease, which does happen and which we all hope for, for ourselves and everyone else with this illness. Don't be frightened by the statistics, they don't tell the whole story, they don't necessarily reflect current treatments, and they group lots of different kinds of cancers together, all of which have differing prognoses. Someone will be along with more experience than I have with your situation (recurrence vs new dx) and will have more helpful advice. I just want to say, you are not alone and you can do this.",

Is there any advantage in waiting until symptoms start to interfere with daily movement, or is it better to \"head it off\" by getting the fluid drained as soon as I start to feel short of breath and hear the wheeze in my breath? (I should mention the fluid is in the chest cavity around my right lung only, the left lung looks clear.) I just started Tamoxifen and Zoladex therapy on October 3rd. I'll have my second treatment on Halloween. For those who responded to treatments, did the fluid stop accumulating? Or did you have to get a surgery to make it stop?

Even if the fluid is just a nuisance and not a threat to your ability to get enough oxygen, you are concerned, and you owe it to yourself to get a medical professional's opinion. I understand the temptation to just wait until your next appointment. It's probably okay to do that. I lived with coughing and shortness of breath for quite some time (months?), thinking I had some kind of allergy or something. The fluid was found accidentally, in the beginning of my diagnostic adventures, after a chest x-ray for something else. The doctor looking at the x-ray told me one lung was half submerged in fluid. He explained the thoracentesis procedure and said I could get one if my breathing got worse. It was when I found myself stopping to catch my breath after walking one or two blocks (flat, no hills) that I decided I needed to get drained. I called my regular doctor and she believed me on the spot (no need to see her or any other doc first), and she hung up the phone and put in my referral me for the thoracentesis. (My insurance requires patients to go through one primary care doc, who has to refer us to all specialists.) Thoracentesis is a really easy outpatient procedure. It takes about twenty minutes. They looked at my x-ray, numbed my back, and stuck a metal tube between my ribs and syphoned off two liters of fluid. It's not pleasant, but it was not terribly painful, and I felt better later that same day. This was at the beginning of my treatment. The Tamoxifen started working right away to shrink my tumors and so far, I haven't had any more shortness of breath, cough, or rattle when I breathe. ",

I have three unfinished novels in my laptop. Yesterday I had a bad day with no energy and more pain than usual. I wondered if I would have enough time or presence of mind to finish anything. What was the point in trying? Today I realize I didn't take a walk or do any exercise yesterday, or talk to anyone, so that might be why I felt so low. I plan to do better today. raro, I think your cat tree project sounds like a real accomplishment, and it's also a physical reminder of the time your family spent together making it. Just don't beat yourself up about how you spend your time. Even high achievers in good health feel down sometimes, with less excuse than we have.",

Sales staff sell ad space based on the subject and placement of the article. I'm guessing few advertisers want their product nestled in with talk of death and dying. A friend once pointed out that basically all women's magazines are the same every month. The household mags have a big picture of food, with a decadent desserts article and a diet article. The younger women's mags all have something about a celebrity, and a \"what he likes in bed\" article. I don't buy magazines anymore. Back on topic though: I agree with the original post that there is very little media attention on metastatic cancer, and that when earlier stage cancers are discussed, the advanced stages are barely, if at all, even mentioned.

Like - I would wait an extra hour to get up to pee because I was so tired and didn't want to walk across a room to get to the bathroom. It got so much better when my oncologist lowered my dose of Ibrance from 125 to 100 mg. Also, I see an acupuncturist - once a week in the beginning, then once every other week, now once a month. And I take at least a 20 minute walk every day. Even when I'm tired, because I know the fatigue is worse if I don't do any walking or stretching (or dancing). I also take something to help me fall asleep at night, because insomnia can make me very tired. (I'm lucky enough to live in a state were medical marijuana is legal). And I asked for help and some accommodations at work. They moved me closer to the area of my main task, and assigned a person to help out when things get too busy. Finally, I would add that before my treatment started working, I had fluid around my lung which meant I would get short of breath, and that caused some fatigue as well. I don't take vitamins. I've seen articles that suggest they may not be helpful for us, and I hate taking pills anyway. To sum up: it's pretty normal to feel extra tired after beginning treatment. After it starts working, you might find yourself perking up! I hope so. Either way, come back and let us know how you do.",

I want to apologize to anyone I ever slighted by minimizing their fears or pain. I'm sorry, I was trying to be helpful. On a more concrete and more easily remedied level, it really bothers me that the radiologists' office that does my scans can't stop themselves every time from treatment-shaming me. They all insist I should get a mastectomy NOW, even though that is not standard protocol anymore. It's not their job to volunteer treatment advice, why do they keep doing it?

I posted the above back in May when I had my PET scan. My oncologist wasn't worried when we got the results, showing activity in the main tumor sites (right breast and armpit), but he referred me for a new mammogram and sonogram. With everything going on in my family, and no one to remind me, I forgot about the mammo. Two months later, my oncologist's nurse called me to say where were those mammogram results? I had to say, no one called me to schedule, and I just forgot about it. I thought the PET scan showed everything still stable... Fast forward to this morning... Today was my mammogram and sonogram. The radiologist said it looks like there is a tumor on the chest wall, under the primary tumor, which is why it wasn't seen on the PET. I don't know what to do now. I guess my oncologist will call me? what happens now?",

I've been spending hours poring over the Ibrance and Faslodex (and the Ibrance & Faslodex) threads. I feel better today. (Fuck you, Cancer, I'm not dead yet.) I have the book you mentioned. I'm also getting some help from the book Breast Cancer: 50 Essential Things to Do. Something that really resonates, as I deal with my helpless dysfunctional parents, is the foreword, written by Dr. Christine Northrop. She describes the Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) study, that concluded unmet childhood needs set the stage for future illnesses. She goes on to quote Lewis Thomas, \"I have come to believe that cancer is the physical metaphor for the extreme need to grow.\" Maybe that's a topic for a separate thread - because things can get pretty heated when we start talking about cancer as a metaphor (journey, war, wake-up call, etc). So I won't go there. It means different things to us at different times, I guess. One thing that's not controversial: without this forum I would be so lost. Thank you all, again. I can never say that enough times.",

Helps me feel like I'm valued. I am more calm now, though the tears are falling. I am numb. Funny how you don't just get the bad news once, with this disease. You get to do it over and over.

If you think about it, milk was designed to take a 90 pound newborn calf to a 500 pound calf in three to four months. It was made for weight gain! And it has way more estrogen when it comes from a cow in its last stages of pregnancy, as opposed to from a cow which has given birth and is lactating to feed its young. This Harvard study is interesting: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/04/milk-hormones-cancer-pregnant-cows-estrogen/",

I was very sad to learn that surgery was no longer recommended for me after they finally got all the tests in and staged me at IV. At first. Then I was put on Tamoxifen and it shrank all my tumors within a few months, with very minimal side effects. I am currently stable, with tumor markers in the normal range. I live like someone who isn't sick. It's amazing and wonderful. If I had had the mastectomy, I would still be dealing with pain, scars, and possible complications from it (not to scare you, but it is a major procedure.) Since your cancer is already metastasized, I wonder if you might give the anti-hormonals a chance to work? The horse is out of the barn, so to speak. At any rate, this is something worth discussing with your medical oncologist. The thing is, for us, going aggressive doesn't guarantee anything except an aggressive treatment. The cancer cells are still in our blood.",

Each diagnostician had a different focus and it wasn't until the very end that I met my MO, who was the one that finally pulled everything together and had the bigger picture. I was seriously stressed by the time they finally figured me out. Treatment (so far) has been calm and orderly in comparison. I also scorn all the things on leggo's list.
