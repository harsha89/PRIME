The fact that you had few nodes removed is a good thing, so that's something in your favor. Also, if you are of normal weight (or can get to a normal weight), that also decreases your risk. There isn't a ton of hard research about the causes of Lymphedema, a lot of studies are retrospective and/or anecdotal, so some of the advice given is \"just in case\" (or CYA ). The hard evidence I've seen concluded that the three biggest risk factors are 1. Overweight, 2. Lots of nodes removed, and 3. Radiation. The things like \"don't injure your arm\" and \"avoid bug bites\" and \"don't fly long distances without a glove/sleeve\" are possible triggers, but I have yet to see valid studies showing the direct link between these things and Lymphedema while also accounting for the main 3 I've named. Personally, I just got sick of the paranoia. I don't have any of the big 3 risk factors, but I did have nodes removed from both sides and have had to have many blood draws and blood pressure readings since. I also love to cook but have Essential Tremor so my shaky hands cause quite a few cuts. I have flown only once but a 2 1/2 hour flight both ways while sound asleep the entire time (thanks to Xanax), and I lift weights regularly. In fact, my arms are sore as I type this. I did start out slowly with the weights after surgery, though, which really just makes sense. Everyone needs to decide for themselves how far they want to go with the precautions. This is just what I've done. I also got an opinion from a LANA-certified physical therapist about these things, and that helped shape my decisions on the subject. Edited to add that I do not have Lymphedema, just in case that wasn't clear.",

Actually, the NCI cancer center oncologist told me that if I had only had the right-side 1cm tumor he wouldn't have even ordered an Oncotype test, because he would have considered it unnecessary. I found that interesting (and not in a good way), considering how many women here had 1cm or less tumors and learned whether they should have chemo from the Oncotype. Needless to say, I'm very happy that I stayed with my local doctors. I was also not impressed with the feel of the NCI cancer center. It was VERY large and industrial-seeming.

My fibroadenoma was 3.9 x 3.0 x 2.1 cm, and the cancer was 2.2 x 1.4 cm. I guess when she went through the mass she just got unlucky and missed the part that had cancer. She took 5 good sized samples. For example, one study I found gave a false-negative percentage of 1.7% for an ultrasound guided core biopsy, which is what I had. I was just part of that small percentage. Oh, and yes, cancer inside a fibroadenoma is VERY rare (somewhere between .001% and .3%). The doctors and nurses I've been seeing have all been very surprised. Most have told me they've never seen it before. At your age, I would say that it's extremely unlikely to be cancer. (((hug))) ",

The doctor asked me if I wanted to leave it or have it taken out. I asked her what she thought and she said she thought I should go ahead and have it removed. I did, a week later, and the mass turned out to be both fibroadenoma and cancer. Now, this is VERY unusual and from the research I could find it's even more unusual for it to happen to a woman under 40. Don't stress about it, but if it's growing it's probably a good idea to have it out, just in case.",

I was just about to turn 46 when I was diagnosed, and my children are a bit older (two girls, 15 and 19, and a foster son, 18). My youngest told me the other day that she told one of her friends who immediately encouraged her to cry and \"let it out\". Very sweet! My daughter said she told her friend that she didn't need to cry, and that because her mom was taking it well, so was she. Honestly I think it's helped my kids A LOT to see me being relatively calm and matter-of-fact about it. I've had my moments of self-pity, but I try very hard to save those for when I'm alone.",

She gave me specific exercises to do, safety tips for exercising after surgery, and massage when I was recovering and getting expander fills (which really helped with the pain associated with the expander fills). She was fantastic. Also, my surgeon was a fantastic, very experienced breast surgeon but I would not want her to be telling me how to exercise post-BMX. One week after my surgery she asked me to raise my arms as high as I could, which was exactly what my PT told me NOT to do for 10-14 days after surgery. I told her I was not supposed to do that yet in order to reduce my risk of Lymphedema and she said, \"Only fat people get Lymphedema.\"",

I got the biopsy and it came back as a fibroadenoma. The surgeon who performed the biopsy told me I could watch it for 6 months and then see if it had grown or we could do an excision on the lump. I asked her what she thought I should do and she told me she wanted to take it out, just to be sure because she didn't like the way it looked. Turned out that 2.2cm of the 3.9cm x 3cm lump was IDC.

If you look at my signature you'll see that I haven't had my surgery yet and my first diagnosis was April 3rd. I've read some studies on this and it's been found to be fine to wait a couple of months before surgery. Also, depending upon the characteristics of your cancer, they may want to do chemo first, in which case it may be quite a few months before you have surgery. It's difficult to wait but if you read around these boards you will see that many women have a pretty long span of time between diagnosis and surgery. Hugs to you.",

Typically if the pathology of a biopsy comes back inconsistent with what the doctor expects they will give the option of waiting a few months to see if the mass grows or doing an excisional biopsy (lumpectomy). If you aren't happy with what your doctors have said you can make an appointment with another doctor for a second opinion. If you do go for a second opinion it's standard for that doctor/facility to request the records they need. The different sizes of the samples seems normal, at least my biopsies had various sample sizes. I'm not super surprised about the different number of samples noted, either, as that is probably just a typo. In my case the first biopsy I had came back benign as well, but the doctor thought the mass looked suspicious enough to recommend an excision. I followed her recommendation and I'm glad I did.",

There was one area that was a bit obscured, so that was why they wanted to biopsy it in the first place. The entire mass was 3.9 x 3 x 2.1 cm. It turns out I have EXTREMELY dense breasts, and when I had an MRI they reported many points with type 2 enhancement curves (suspicious) as well as the mass in the right breast that was completely hidden in my mammogram and turned out to also be IDC. The doctors basically told me I absolutely must have a bilateral mastectomy because of this. Have you had an MRI? I'm not sure they would order one for you based on what you've said here, but just wondering. Hummingbird, I'm also a 36B and as you can see from my note to Gina, the mass they removed was pretty large. There is definitely a \"space\" where the lump was, but it really isn't as noticeable as I thought it would be, and it's only been a bit over a month since I had it removed. I've read that many times the \"space\" fills in over time.",

I make decisions based on knowledge of the facts. Knowing that obesity greatly increases risk of Lymphedema, I make sure to keep my weight down. Knowing that the occasional needle stick from an injection or a blood pressure reading on an at-risk arm hasn't been shown to increase risk, I allow those things. Knowing that longer-term needles like IVs can increase risk, I go through the trouble of having IVs put into my foot instead. Statistics matter to me, and I'd rather not spend my entire life taking unnecessary precautions, like wearing a sleeve for air travel when I have a very low risk. Is there still some risk? Yes, but that risk is low and I'm not a risk-averse person.",

The doctor asked if I wanted it removed or watched. She suggested I remove it so I did. I found out last week that the results on the entire mass came back with cancer. The mass was 3.9 x 3 x 2.1 cm and the cancer was 2.2 cm. The cancer is described as IDC with tubular features, grade 1, Estrogen and Progesterone positive, waiting on the Her2/neu results. (They also found DCIS, cribriform type.) So now I find myself in an odd situation because this is unusual. They didn't check my lymph nodes at all and the cancer went right to the edge of the mass they took out. The plan is to give me an MRI to check for more cancer, and I'm not sure what we'll do with my breast. I already have a 2 inch incision and a large chunk of flesh out of it - I'm a B cup, not all that much to spare - but there is still cancer in there. Did anyone have a similar experience and do you think the MRI next is the right way to go? I do have swollen lymph nodes but I also have mixed connective tissue disease so that could be the cause. Right now I'm mainly just angry, because I'm 45, take good care of myself, and have no risk factors at all except early onset of my period (11). There are hardly any people at all in my family who have had cancer. Sigh. Age at dx: 45. Oncotype, left-side tumor: 9. Right side had multifocal IDC and \"extensive\" LCIS.

I read some studies and the rates I found were all between .0125% and .3%. I don't think my doctor had ever seen it before, she was very surprised. I'm definitely not going to borrow trouble by worrying too much about the lymph nodes before they're checked. It will stay in the back of my mind until I know for sure, though. Daisylover, when you had the re-excision were you concerned about the damage to your breast? I'm thinking that if the MRI comes back ok they'll want to do a re-excision to try to get clean margins but I'm just not sure it's worth trying when I really think my breast will be pretty badly deformed with any additional tissue removed. It doesn't seem like reconstruction options for breast conserving surgery are as good, but I haven't done much research on that.",

No fun! I'm doing great now! I'm lucky in that I didn't have to have chemo or radiation and I didn't have any complications from any of the surgeries so I started feeling better very quickly. I'm very happy with my reconstruction, scars are healing nicely and I will be getting nipple tattoos in June to complete my foobs. ",

I was given the choice to wait 6 months instead, but I knew my surgeon was very experienced and well-respected so I followed her advice to have it removed. It's always good to get the opinion of a very experienced doctor or two. (Yay Broncos! I love it when they're in the Super Bowl!) StaceySue, I did go larger. I was a rather deflated B cup before. Now I wear a D cup. It doesn't look that large, though, so even though the letter shocked me at first, I actually look balanced now. They don't look like my real breasts, that's for sure, but I really like how they look and can't wait for the tattoos! I looked into a DIEP but the doctor said I'd end up with smaller breasts because although I have some loose skin from pregnancies, there's not much fat underneath and he would have had to take the fat from elsewhere. Even with my implants the doctor took the fat for grafting from my thighs.",

I have had two blood draws since my mastectomy and both have been taken from an at-risk arm. It's difficult to do blood draws from a foot. The nurses skip the tourniquet and just use a bit of pressure and a band-aid after the draw. (I have great veins in my arms.)

However, now other relatives are taken into account. http://www.cancernetwork.com/breast-cancer/new-tas... This article with USPSTF screening recommendations has a link to the B-RST screening tool. This is just one of the tools used to assess if genetic testing should be done, and it looks at multiple family members (https://www.breastcancergenescreen.org/screening.a...): \"Is there any history of breast or ovarian cancer in your family? Think about both your mother and father's side of the family. Include yourself, parents, children, brothers/sisters, aunts/uncles, nieces/nephews, and grandparents.\" The CDC's statement http://www.cdc.gov/genomics/resources/diseases/bre...: \"In general, the more close relatives who have had breast or ovarian cancer, and the earlier their ages of diagnosis, the greater a woman's risk. Close relatives include parents, sisters, brothers, children, aunts, uncles, grandparents, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren.\" A helpful chart to assess risk: http://www.cdc.gov/genomics/resources/diseases/bre... Here is the NCCN's guidelines for family history: http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pd.... They include third-degree relatives on the same side of the family as \"close blood relatives\". There are others, but these were the easiest to find. It sounds like your relatives are too far removed to increase your risk by the current standards, but of course the area of genetics is rapidly changing.",

She tells them not to wear any compression of any kind, but to get up often and walk (if possible), and to pump your arms in the air whenever possible. Also, if possible, go swimming after the flight. She said that she believes the compression is more likely to cause LE than to prevent it in those not already diagnosed. Of course this is only theory (as usual).",

If it becomes clear that these common risks turn out not to be risks at all I will gladly go back to allowing them. (If I only had one arm involved it wouldn't be such a big deal to me, but both of my arms are off-limits and it's a big pain.) One study does not constitute enough evidence, of course, but just the fact that studies are being done is very encouraging to me.",
