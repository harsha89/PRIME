Invasive triple Neg.  Lumpectomy, 4 cycles of AC and 30 Rad. TX I thought I was cruising until I found a lump, same breast.  March 1, 2008.  Pet scan showed a 2.9 cm lung lesion.  I had a lobectomy and mastectomy the same day followed by 12 Avastin/Taxol.  I am off TX now and am just plain old scared.  Good luck everyone and I look forward to sharing.
