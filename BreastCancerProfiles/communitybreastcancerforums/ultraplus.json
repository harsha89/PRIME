Good for you, hopefully, and good for me.  I finished  chemo in late June, 2011. I drank tonnnns of water and cocoanut water to stay hydrated during chemo. I did 4 AC DD followed by 4 Taxol DD --so 2 weeks apart.  Lots of side effects, but nothing I couldn't handle. I'm 44, in great shape, athletic, no major health issues previously except some broken bones that healed really well.  Lost over 20 lbs during chemo.  Chemotherapy is no fun. It is very difficult, but doable.   You are going through something really hard!  Be gentle with yourself, but be tough.  You matter.  Your fight against cancer matters to so many people. People you don't even know. You're going to get through this! HAIR --was thick and long --down to my lower back. Always had bangs. It started slowly popping out around 10 days after my first treatment. I babied it --minimal brushing, etc. Had my second treatment on day 14, and the hair was popping out in clumps. I had so much hair that it wasn't really noticable, and I just kept being really gentle with it.  That was a Wednesday. So I decided I'd use my vacuum cleaner hose to suck it out on Friday night. Got that idea from one of these discussion threads.  But Friday morning it just came out in handfuls. Was sad, but kind of a relief.  I sucked out as much as I could and then cut the clumps that remained real short. I threw on a scarf and headed into work.  The vacuum really worked for me. I couldn't find a wig that would stay on my tiny head (even tried children's wigs!), so I wore some nice silk scarves and Buffs --stretchy cool looking scarves --get them online or REI, EMS, sporty stores. Sores -mouth, hands, feet, elsewhere (!) --Witch Hazel worked to sooth and heal quickly. Be well. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.",

I have dense, fibrous breasts, had a gyno who poo-pooed years of advisories from labs for additional tests and biopsies due to mamogram results. I trusted my doctor. She just didn't take them seriously, to my detriment. Finally felt a lump myself during a self-exam, and immediately called a different gyno, had a mamo (didn't show the lump, but showed the same cloudy, distorted area that provoked the previous requests from labs to search further) and an ultrasound. Doc at ultrasound said nothing serious, but when he left the room the tech (female) urged me to see a surgeon and have it biopsied or removed (confirming my gut feeling all along). Cancer, large and far enough along to hit a lymph node. Get it out now, please. Wish you the best!!",
