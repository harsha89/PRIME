One week on one week off cycle.  The only way I was able to tolerate at all. Soaking feet / hands in cold ice water for pain relief. Carafate liquid (prescription) for mouth sores. Coolmax socks during the summer. Heat makes the skin worse. Stay off feet & elevate as much as possible.  Ritalin (prescription) and caffeine can help with sleepiness & fatigue. Antidepressant for depressed mood -- seriously.  It was the worst chemo for that for me so far.  Some have used a henna solution -- I tried and it was too staining for my hands.  I gave up on the feet too, should have kept on trying it. xelodasideeffects.blogspot.com/ ",

Both the above are swalloable in small amounts, which helps if you have throat or vocal cord issues.  You can gargle then swallow. Liquid lidocaine, numbs the whole mouth but tastes nasty.  Worth it though if you are in extreme pain.  Or, you can spot treat individual hot spots with a q tip dipped in lidocaine.",

Does your mom's oncologist have a nurse that you can talk to about this?  You definitely need to get your mom to sign some sort of paperwork naming your DPOA (durable power of attorney for healthcare).  Does your oncologist's office have a social worker you can talk to?  Does the hospital your mom's oncologist admits patients to have a social worker?  Maybe if you just called a hospice in your mom's town and tole them of your situation, they could advise you of your next steps, even if you didn't use their services. Your mom has fought a good, long, hard fight.  Don't feel guilty about helping her through the next stage.  ",

Yes, it is scary when people at an early stage (1 and 2) have recurrences, but it does happen with a LOT of regularity.  And it is through NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. I'm not saying to make the early stage folks paranoid or worried about your futures.  In fact, I'm saying it for the opposite reason.  Do what you can when you are first diagnosed.  Research what options you have, and do what you can afterward (anti-hormonal treatment etc.).  Then whatever comes comes, and you will have peace knowing that you have done everything known to medical science, at the time you had that information.",

So I fished it out and threw it in the garbage. Zachary stood there thinking for a moment, then ran to my bathroom and came out with my toothbrush. He held it up and said with a charming little smile, \"We better throw this one out too then, 'cause it fell in the toilet a few days ago.\" OPINIONS On the first day of school, a first-grader handed his teacher a note from his mother. The note read, \"The opinions expressed by this child are not necessarily those of his parents.\" KETCHUP A woman was trying hard to get the ketchup to come out of the jar. During her struggle the phone rang so she asked her 4-year-old daughter to answer the phone. \"It's the minister, Mommy,\" the child said to her mother Then she added, \"Mommy can't come to the phone to talk to you right now. She's hitting the bottle.\" MORE NUDITY A little boy got lost at the YMCA and found himself in the women's locker room. When he was spotted, the room burst into shrieks, with ladies grabbing towels and running for cover. The little boy watched in amazement and then asked, \"What's the matter haven't you ever seen a little boy before?\" ELDERLY While working for an organization that delivers lunches to elderly shut-ins, I used to take my 4- year-old daughter on my afternoon rounds. The various appliances of old age, particularly the canes, walkers and wheelchairs, unfailingly intrigued her. One day I found her staring at a pair of false teeth soaking in a glass. As I braced myself for the inevitable barrage of questions, she merely turned and whispered, \"The tooth fairy will never believe this!\" DRESS-UP A little girl was watching her parents dress for a party. When she saw her dad donning his tuxedo, she warned, \"Daddy, you shouldn't wear that suit.\" \"And why not, darling?\" \"You know that it always gives you a headache the next morning..\" DEATH While walking along the sidewalk in front of his church, our minister heard the intoning of a prayer that nearly made his collar wilt. Apparently, his 5-year-old son and his playmates had found a dead robin. Feeling that proper burial should be performed, they had secured a small box and cotton batting, then dug a hole and made ready for the disposal of the deceased. The minister's son was chosen to say the appropriate prayers and with sonorous dignity intoned his version of what he thought his Father always said: \"Glory be unto the Faaaather, and unto the Sonnn .. and into the hole he gooooes.\" SCHOOL A little girl had just finished her first week of school. \"I'm just wasting my time,\" she said to her mother. \"I can't read, I can't write and they won't let me talk!\" BIBLE A little boy opened the big family bible. He was fascinated as he fingered through the old pages. Suddenly, something fell out of the Bible. He picked up the object and looked at it. What he saw was an old leaf that had been pressed in between the pages. \"Mama, look what I found\", the boy called out. \"What have you got there, dear?\" With astonishment in the young boy's voice, he answered, \"I think it's Adam's underwear.\"",

Approaching the Hyundai, deputies said they could smell a strong odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle, according to the report. After writing a speeding ticket, a Manatee County Sheriff's deputy asked Roberts, 25, if he smoked marijuana and when had he done it last. Roberts replied that he smoked the night before and there was nothing in the car. He even told the two deputies to search the car, reports The Bradenton Herald. While searching Roberts' body, deputies felt a soft object - between his buttocks. The report said Roberts then said, \"Let me get it,\" and pulled out a baggie of marijuana weighing 4.5 grams. He denied holding anything else, according to the Herald. But the deputies then felt another soft object in the same area and pulled it out through the exterior of Roberts' shorts. The object was a bag with 27 pieces of rock cocaine weighing 3.5 grams, reports the Herald. When the bag fell to the ground, Roberts immediately explained that, \"The white stuff is not mine, but the weed is.\" He then stated that his friend had borrowed the vehicle before and he saw the cocaine on the passenger seat when he was pulled over, according to the Herald. Roberts has been charged with possession of rock cocaine and marijuana.",

      "Content": "MJLToday wrote: www.breastcancer.org/treatment... SABCS: Novel Biologic Beats Zoledronic Acid for Bone Mets Metastatic breast cancer that has spread to one or more bones can be painful and can cause broken bones and spinal compression if bone is destroyed by the cancer. Zometa (chemical name: zoledronic acid) is used to strengthen bones in women diagnosed with breast cancer that has spread to the bone. Zometa is given intravenously and can reduce bone pain and the risk of fractures and other bone complications. The study reviewed here found that denosumab, an experimental targeted therapy medicine, was a little better than Zometa at preventing bone pain and slowing bone complications, including broken bones, from breast cancer that had spread to the bones. These results were reported at the 2009 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Targeted therapy medicines target specific cell characteristics that affect how the cells behave. Some targeted therapies, including denosumab, are antibodies that work like the antibodies made naturally by the body's immune system. Denosumab targets a protein called RANK ligand (RANKL), which affects the activity of certain bone cells (osteoclasts). Osteoclasts cause a normal amount of bone breakdown to help regulate the body's calcium level. Osteoclasts tend to be overactive when breast cancer spreads to the bones. Overactive osteoclasts can cause bone pain and bone destruction. By blocking or inhibiting the RANKL protein, denosumab lowers the activity level of the osteoclasts, which reduces the risk of pain and other bone complications. In the study reviewed here, 2,046 women diagnosed with advanced-stage breast cancer that had spread to bone were split into two groups: * about half the women got denosumab every 4 weeks; denosumab is given as an injection under the skin * the other women got Zometa every 4 weeks; Zometa is given intravenously every 4 weeks To make sure that neither the doctors nor the women knew who was getting which medicine, all the women got both an injection and an intravenous infusion, one of which had no medicine in it, every 4 weeks. All the women were monitored for bone pain, bone fractures, and spinal cord compression. The researchers also watched to see if any of the women needed radiation treatments or surgery to treat bone complications due to the cancer. * The length of time before moderate or severe bone pain developed was 13% longer in women who received denosumab compared to women who got Zometa. * Radiation often is used to treat bone pain caused by metastatic breast cancer; women who got denosumab went about 22% longer before they needed radiation treatment compared to women who got Zometa. * Bone complications (also called skeletal morbidities) -- fractures, spinal cord compression, or the need for radiation or surgery to bone metastasis problems -- were 22% lower overall in women who got denosumab compared to women who got Zometa. * Bone complications happened a little bit later in women who got denosumab compared to women who got Zometa, but this difference wasn't statistically significant, which means it could have been due to chance and not because of the denosumab. Denosumab seemed to cause the same side effects as Zometa. A rare but serious side effect of both medicines is osteonecrosis of the jaw, a condition in which the cells in the jawbone start to die. Osteonecrosis of the jaw developed in 1.4% of women who got Zometa and 2% of women who got denosumab. While these results are promising, denosumab is still considered an experimental treatment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering approving denosumab to treat women diagnosed with breast cancer that has spread to bone. One advantage of denosumab is that it's given by a simple injection under the skin, instead of an intravenous infusion like Zometa. Still, denosumab is expected to be more expensive than Zometa. If you've been diagnosed with advanced-stage breast cancer that has spread to one or more of your bones, you and your doctor will work together to develop a treatment plan that minimizes any pain you might have and reduces your risk of bone complications. Zometa may be part of your plan, but if denosumab is approved by the FDA, it could be an option. SAN ANTONIO (MedPage Today) -- The investigational monoclonal antibody denosumab relieves painful bone metastases and prevents their serious complications in breast cancer patients better than standard zoledronic acid (Zometa). The skeletal morbidity rate dropped a relative 22% with denosumab compared with the bisphosphonate (0.45 versus 0.58 per person-year, P=0.004) in a randomized controlled trial of more than 2,000 breast cancer patients with bone metastases, Alison Stopeck, MD, of the Arizona Cancer Center at the University of Arizona in Tuscon, and colleagues found. Time to first radiation treatment for bone metastases as an objective measure of pain improved by a relative 26% as well with the novel injectable drug compared with zoledronic acid (P=0.01), they reported here at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. And the boost in efficacy did not come at the price of more overall or serious adverse events, Stopek said. Denosumab -- a biologic agent targeted at the RANK ligand, the primary mediator of bone-resorbing osteoclast formation -- is currently in regulatory limbo. When drug developer Amgen went before the FDA in the fall seeking approval for indications in osteoporosis and osteopenia, the agency didn't heed its advisory panel's recommendation and instead delayed a decision. Whether the skeletal event data will be enough to convince the agency to grant an indication in bone metastases secondary to breast cancer is anyone's guess, said Gary H. Lyman, MD, MPH, of Duke University. But the new positive findings presented at SABCS came as no surprise, said Lyman, who sits on the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Panel. (He recused himself for the denosumab decision.) As Stopeck reported at the ECCO-ESMO meeting earlier this year, denosumab extended the time to first skeletal-related event by a relative 18% compared with zoledronic acid. Thus the trial met both noninferiority and superiority criteria for this primary endpoint (P<0.0001 and P=0.01, respectively). It included 2,046 advanced breast cancer patients with confirmed bone metastases randomized to double-blind, double-dummy treatment with denosumab (120 mg subcutaneously) or zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously) every four weeks. The researchers again reported that denosumab-treated patients went 13% longer before experiencing moderate or severe pain than those on the current standard of care (median 88 versus 64 days, P=0.009). A new secondary result presented here showed fewer patients had skeletal-related events -- defined by fracture, radiation, surgery, or spinal cord compression on denosumab. The crude proportion of patients who had at least one of these events was 5.6% lower with denosumab at month 12 (25.1% versus 26.6%), 11.5% lower at month 18 (28.6% versus 32.3%), and 15.9% lower at month 34 (30.7% versus 36.5%). Although the curves appeared to be separating, the difference didn't reach statistical significance at any of these time points. Because there is no single universally accepted measure for skeletal health in this population, the additional secondary endpoints \"strengthen the interest and confidence that there is greater efficacy with the RANK ligand inhibitor denosumab,\" Lyman told MedPage Today. Stopeck said that if the drug were approved, she would rapidly incorporate it into her practice for its efficacy and convenience as a subcutaneous injection that doesn't require renal monitoring, \"assuming the price isn't exorbitant.\" Although the drug's developer has not released pricing information, cost is likely to be an issue, Lyman noted. There have also been concerns over osteonecrosis of the jaw, which was numerically more frequent with denosumab than with zoledronic acid in the trial (2.0% versus 1.4%), but the difference was not statistically significant. Stopeck said that the majority of these patients had risk factors, such as poor oral health or a tooth extraction, and chalked it up as a chance event. Lyman agreed that this difference would not be clinically significant. In fact, Theresa Guise, MD, of Indiana University in Indianapolis, who moderated a press conference at which the results were presented, said she took the data as evidence against osteonecrosis of the jaw as a class effect for potent bisphosphonates. Whether there is any difference in the reversibility of this adverse event is a question Stopeck said her group plans to analyze. The study was supported by Amgen, which is developing denosumab. Stopeck reported conflicts of interest for Amgen as well as Novartis, maker of zoledronic acid. Co-authors reported conflicts of interest with Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Daiichi-Sankyo, Eisai, Taiho, Pfizer, Amgen, Abraxis, Monogram Biosciences, and Eli Lilly. Several reported being employed by and major stockholders in Amgen. Guise reported being on the advisory board for Amgen, Novartis, Lilly, and Roche. Lyman reported having recieved neutropenia-related research funding from Amgen and sitting on the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Panel.

Anesthetic technique and the cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase response to primary breast cancer surgery. Deegan CA, Murray D, Doran P, Moriarty DC, Sessler DI, Mascha E, Kavanagh BP, Buggy DJ. Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Surgery remains the most effective treatment. Several perioperative factors, including the surgical stress response, many anesthetics and opioids, adversely affect immune function. Regional anesthesia-analgesia attenuates perioperative immunosuppression. We tested the hypothesis that patients who receive combined propofol/paravertebral anesthesia-analgesia (propofol/paravertebral) exhibited reduced levels of protumorigenic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and elevated levels of antitumorigenic cytokines compared with patients receiving sevoflurane anesthesia with opioid analgesia (sevoflurane/opioid). METHODS: Primary breast cancer surgery patients were randomized to propofol/paravertebral (n = 15) or sevoflurane/opioid (n = 17) and preoperative and postoperative serum concentrations of 11 cytokines (interleukin 1β [IL-1β], IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, interferon γ, and tumor necrosis factor α) and 3 MMPs (MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9) were measured. RESULTS: Treatment groups were well balanced for age, weight, surgical procedure, and cancer pathologic diagnosis. Pain scores were lower at 1 and 2 hrs with paravertebral analgesia compared with morphine but similar at 24 hrs. Patients in the propofol/paravertebral group showed a greater percentage decrease in postoperative compared with preoperative IL-1β (median [quartiles], -26% [-15% to -52%] versus -4% [-14% to 2%], P = 0.003), a significant attenuation in elevated MMP-3 (2% [-39% to 12%] versus 29% [23%-59%], P = 0.011) and MMP-9 (26% [13%-54%] versus 74% [50%-108%], P = 0.02), and a significant increase in IL-10 (10% [5%-33%] versus -15% [20% to -2%], P = 0.001) compared with sevoflurane/opioid group. No significantly different changes in IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, IL-13, interferon γ, tumor necrosis factor α, or MMP-1 were observed between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol/paravertebral anesthesia-analgesia for breast cancer surgery alters a minority of cytokines influential in regulating perioperative cancer immunity. Further evaluation is required to determine the significance of these observations.",

But, could they be linked to breast cancer? That is what a group of researchers at Stanford University want to find out. They are studying the effect that stress and sleep-related hormones may have on the immune system and cancer progression. Who Can Participate? You can join the Stress and Breast Cancer study if you match ALL of these MAIN categories: You are a woman between 45 and 75 You have been diagnosed with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer at somepoint during your life You live in Northern California (willing to travel to Stanford University and live no more than a one-hour time zone away from California) You are able to travel to Stanford University and stay overnight in the hospital You have not had another cancer in the past 10 years other than breast cancer, skin cancer, or in situ cancer of the cervix The research staff will ask you additional questions to be sure that this study is the right fit for you. What Does Participation Involve? If you join the Stress and Breast Cancer study, you will be asked to answer questions about your medical history and health-related behaviors. You will also participate in a 2-week at-home sleep data collection, which includes keeping a sleep log, wearing a watch-like device that will assess your activity and sleep, and two nights of more detailed sleep recording. Finally, you will be asked to stay at Stanford Hospital for 28 hours where your sleep will be assessed, and you will be asked to provide blood samples through an IV, saliva samples, and complete a psychological assessment including interviews and questionnaires.

      "Content": "Nov 11, 2011 06:35PM MJLToday wrote: Still BS.  Here's an interesting article to put the whole \"early detection\" / mammogram thing into perspective: www.medscape.com/viewarticle/7...  www.medscape.com \"Mammography Saves Lives\" Slogan Doesn't Tell Full Story Harms are underreported, if mentioned at all Zosia Chustecka November 18, 2010 - The current Mammography Saves Lives campaign in the United States and previous campaigns promoting screening for breast cancer are not providing balanced information, because they underreport, or don't mention at all, potential harms from the procedure, say critics. This campaign slogan is 1-sided, several critics told Medscape Medical News, and it oversells the benefits of mammography. When asked for a more accurate headline, H. Gilbert Welch MD, MPH, from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire, had the following tongue-in-cheek suggestions: \"Mammography could save your life, but it's a long shot\" and \"Chances are it won't, but mammography could save your life.\" Dr. Welch recently wrote an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine (2010;363:1276-1277) discussing the benefits and harms of screening mammography, in which he reviews new data from Norway that - he says - confirm that \"the decision about whether to undergo screening mammography is, in fact, a close call.\" Public information campaigns about mammography should reflect this, he told Medscape Medical News. Another critic of the promotional campaign is John D. Keen, MD, MBA, from the Cook County John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. Explaining to Medscape Medical News that he is a diagnostic radiographer and breast imager with no conflicts of interest and no axe to grind, he said he is very concerned about physicians getting a balanced picture of mammography screening for breast cancer. In a recent communication in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2010;23:775-782), Dr. Keen writes that \"the premise of a near universal life-saving benefit from finding presymptomatic breast cancer through mammography is false.\" Statistically, there is only a 5% chance that a mammogram will save a woman's life, he points out. And that chance has to be balanced against potential harms, which vary with age, Dr. Keen continues. For instance, women who are 40 to 50 years of age are \"10 times more likely to experience overdiagnosis and overtreatment than to have their lives saved by mammography,\" he writes. Dr. Keen told Medscape Medical News that he is concerned that much of the ongoing debate about mammography has been dominated by screening advocates, but pointed out that many of these experts have professional and financial interests in mammography. He is concerned that they are promoting screening without presenting the whole story. This point has also been raised by others, including the authors of a recent article published in the New England Journal of Medicine (2010;363;1076-1079), entitled Lessons From the Mammography Wars. There is no regulation of marketing in healthcare, they point out - \"the same group that provides a service also tells us how valuable that service is and how much of it we need, as when the Society of Breast Imaging sets the recommendations for mammography.\" New Campaign in the United States The new Mammography Saves Lives campaign is produced by the American College of Radiology, the Society of Breast Imaging, and the American Society of Breast Disease. It is currently running on television and radio across the United States, and features testimonials from several women who report that mammography saved their lives. \"In fact, there is no way of knowing if an individual was indeed 'saved',\" Karsten Juhl Jorgensen, MD, from the Nordic Cochrane Center in Copenhagen, Denmark, told Medscape Medical News. The Nordic Cochrane Center group, which includes Peter Gøtzsche, PhD, has developed an evidence-based outline of the harms and benefits of mammography. They have been very vocal in criticizing information sent out to the general public in national campaigns for breast screening in many countries in Europe, and in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. The leaflets sent out to invite women for mammography screening in these countries have not contained adequate descriptions of the harms and benefits, they argue; their fierce criticism led to a very public controversy in the United Kingdom last year when a government-produced leaflet was withdrawn and redesigned. \"The situation in the United States is different, in that there is no national screening program to set a common standard for information at invitation,\" Dr. Jorgensen said. \"It is much harder to tease out what information is given in the United States, as this may vary considerably across health plans and physicians,\" he told Medscape Medical News. \"There is no doubt that screening mammography has generally been oversold\" in invitations to screening and in campaigns from cancer societies and other interest groups everywhere in the world where this has been studied, Dr. Jorgensen said. The result is that women \"trust screening to reduce their risk of dying from breast cancer to an extent that is in no way scientifically justified,\" he continued. We would all like to believe that a woman's life will be saved by mammography \"if a cancer that she did not know about is detected at screening,\" he said. \"But in fact, the likelihood that the woman in question will be diagnosed with breast cancer unnecessarily is 10 times greater.\" \"There is no way of knowing if the symptom-free cancer she was diagnosed with would ever have developed into clinical disease. And if it was destined to do so, we cannot know if the screen-detection changed the prognosis in her particular case. She may very well have survived her disease without screening or died from relapsing breast cancer 10 years later,\" he said. Estimates of Harm Not Universally Accepted However, a leading advocate of mammography, Carol Lee, MD, chair of the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Commission, who is quoted on the MammographySavesLives.org Web site, suggested that the estimates of harms used by Dr. Keen and Dr. Jorgensen are not universally accepted, and have been questioned by others in the field. Some of the numbers used are \"very debatable,\" Dr. Lee said in an interview with Medscape Medical News. The view from the Nordic Cochrane Group is well known to be at the extreme end of a very polarized debate, she added. \"We all have different perspectives and different ways of looking at data,\" she said. Dr. Lee emphasized that there is absolutely no doubt that screening reduces breast cancer mortality. In the United States, there has been a nearly 30% reduction in breast cancer mortality since the introduction of widespread mammography screening in the mid-1980s. Although there have been improvements in treatment during this time, she \"cannot believe that at least part of this reduction is not due to screening.\" \"Screening is not perfect,\" she noted. \"There are harms; there are harms with every test,\" Dr. Lee acknowledged. But the discussion of benefit and harm is a very complex one. It is different for each individual woman, and the place for that discussion is in the doctor's office, Dr. Lee insisted. Every person needs to have that discussion with their healthcare provider whenever any tests is ordered, she emphasized. \"The Mammography Saves Lives campaign does tell women to talk to their doctor,\" she said, \"but the bottom line is that mammography does save lives and we need to get this message out, because mammography can't save lives if women don't utilize it.\" The message needs to be clear, she continued. \"We can't say you might do it, or you might not',\" she said. And the proposition that \"if you are 40 years old you should have a discussion but if you are 50 years old you should have a mammogram doesn't make sense to me.\" Dr. Lee was referring to last year's recommendation from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) that made that age distinction, sparking outrage from screening advocates. That USPSTF recommendation has been generally interpreted as questioning the efficacy of mammograms, Dr. Lee explained, adding that she has heard women around the world saying that the US government thinks that mammograms are not worthwhile. \"This is very frustrating to me,\" she said, because \"here we have a public health measure that works.\" One of the stated aims of the new campaign is \"to clear confusion.\" The message has to be clear or it will just create more confusion, Dr. Lee emphasized. Something along the lines of \"mammography saves lives but it may not be a good thing for you individually\" would just add to the confusion that is already out there, she argued. The campaign emphasizes the point that screening does reduce breast cancer mortality, but whether it is right for each individual woman is for her to discuss with her healthcare provider, she said. Better Than Previous Campaigns, But Still Unbalanced The current campaign is better than some of the previous campaigns promoting breast cancer screening, said Dr. Welch. Both he and Dr. Jorgensen were critical of the American Cancer Society's campaign in the 1980s, which declared: \"If you haven't had a mammogram, you need more than your breasts examined.\" This is an example of a 1-sided campaign - it mentions nothing about the harms of screening, Dr. Jorgensen pointed out. \"The truth is that mammography screening today has marginal benefits and serious harms, and that a decision not to get screened can be as sensible and responsible as the decision to get screened.\" Dr. Welch echoed this sentiment in his recent editorial, entitled Screening Mammography - A Long Run for a Short Slide?\" (N Engl J Med. 2010;363:1276-1278). It was prompted by new data from Norway that appeared in the same issue (Kalagar et al. N Engl J Med 2010;363[13]:1203-1210), which highlighted the fact that the mortality benefit from mammography is modest. A decision not to get screened can be as sensible and responsible as the decision to get screened. The benefit seen was smaller than that previously reported in clinical trials, he explained to Medscape Medical News, but in the meantime, there have been improvements in the treatment of clinical detected breast cancer, and an increasing awareness among women to report any breast abnormalities. \"There is no debate about the value of diagnostic mammography in these circumstances,\" Dr. Welch emphasized, but there are questions about the value of screening mammography in healthy women. \"These new data from Norway are probably the best representation we have of effectiveness in clinical practice,\" Dr. Welch said. They confirm the view that \"the decision about whether to undergo screening mammography is, in fact, a close call.\" There is \"a delicate balance between modest benefit and modest harm,\" Dr. Welch wrote in his editorial, using data from the Norwegian study to illustrate his point. Dr. Welch estimated that a 10-year course of screening mammography for 2500 women 50 years of age would save the life of 1 woman from breast cancer. At the same time, up to 1000 women would have had a \"false alarm,\" about half of those would undergo biopsy, and breast cancer will have been overdiagnosed in 5 to 15 women, who would have been treated needlessly with surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy, alone or in combination. Mammography could save your life, but it's a long shot. \"Although the current campaign doesn't suggest that women who forgo mammography need their head examined, it remains 1-sided,\" Dr. Welch told Medscape Medical News. It still focuses only on the benefit of mammography, which is why he suggested alternative tongue-in-cheek slogans, such as \"Mammography could save your life, but it's a long shot.\" \"What we really need to do is develop a more balanced campaign that respects the fact that different women can make different choices,\" he explained. \"Since there is no single 'right answer' about screening mammography, our goal should be to encourage women to feel good about the answer that's right for them,\" he said. To that end, Dr. Welch suggested that the promotion of screening mammography should reflect this, and offered the following as an example of the way in which the message could be publicized.

Local treatment might include surgery to remove the affected lymph nodes, and possibly also radiation therapy. Whole-body treatment might include chemotherapy, targeted therapies such as Herceptin (chemical name: trastuzumab), and hormonal (anti-estrogen) therapy.",

      "Content": "MJLToday wrote: An interesting report from the European Cancer Conference.  Mostly just anecdotal, not really a statistical study, but encouraging nonetheless. ECCO-ESMO: Long Remission Possible in Advanced Breast Cancer This report is part of a 12-month Clinical Context series. By Kristina Fiore, Staff Writer, MedPage Today Published: September 26, 2011 Reviewed by Vandana G. Abramson, MD; Assistant Professor of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee and Dorothy Caputo, MA, RN, BC-ADM, CDE, Nurse Planner Action Points Note that this study was published as an abstract and presented at a conference. These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Goal: Explain that of 120 patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, 9% acheived a complete durable remission (disease free for at least three years) after being treated with chemotherapy and trastuzumab in first-line therapy. Note that although a statistical analysis was not performed, durable complete remissions were associated with diagnosis in the sixth decade of life, ER negative disease, and liver-only disease. STOCKHOLM -- A small proportion of metastatic breast cancer patients can achieve complete remission that lasts with trastuzumab (Herceptin) plus chemotherapy, researchers said here. In a two-center study, almost 10% of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients achieved a \"durable complete remission,\" defined as being disease-free for at least three years, according to Giuseppe Gullo, MD, of St. Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin. He reported the findings during a scientific session here at the European Multidisciplinary Cancer Congress, formerly known as the joint congress of the European Cancer Organization and European Society for Medical Oncology (ECCO-ESMO). \"It's not a statistical analysis,\" Gullo cautioned, \"but durable complete remission is more frequently connected to being diagnosed in the sixth decade, being ER-negative, and having liver-only disease metastases.\" Gullo explained that durable complete remission after treatment with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer has been reported anecdotally in the literature, but there are a lack of data on its long-term outcomes. There are also scant data on the optimal duration of maintenance trastuzumab after complete remission. So he and his colleagues conducted a retrospective review of 120 patients who were treated between May 2000 and April 2011 with the combination therapy at two institutions, St. Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin and Humanitas Cancer Center in Milan. The primary goal was to assess the long-term outcome of patients achieving durable complete response; secondary aims included exploration of the clinical features associated with this type of response. Durable complete remission was defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria lasting at least 36 months. Gullo and colleagues found that 11 patients, or 9% of the total population, achieved this level of remission during a median of 6.5 years of follow-up. Median age was 59 and the median duration of trastuzumab was 63 months. Gullo cautioned that the research team did not perform a statistical analysis, but numerically, durable complete remission was linked with ER- or PR-negative disease or if they were diagnosed in their 60s. Also, a larger proportion of those with durable complete remission had liver-only metastases compared with those who didn't have durable remission (55% versus 18%). Three patients relapsed on maintenance trastuzumab -- at 49, 53, and 94 months, respectively. Five patients discontinued maintenance trastuzumab, and only one of those had ipsilateral breast relapse 52 months after stopping the therapy, Gullo said. He added that four patients are still on maintenance trastuzumab, and nine patients are still alive and in complete remission. Seven of them never relapsed. Among those seven, the median age is 60, 71% are ER- and PR-negative, 57% have liver-only metastatic disease, and all had first-line chemotherapy plus trastuzumab -- four had docetaxel/carboplatin, two had a single-agent taxane, and one had capecitabine. Gullo said the data suggest that in some cases of durable complete remission, maintenance trastuzumab can be safely discontinued with a very low risk of subsequent relapse. \"In our experience, discontinuation of maintenance trastuzumab was not associated with increased disease relapse,\" he said, again cautioning the lack of statistical analysis. \"We can't answer the question about optimal duration, but discontinuation does not appear to be associated with relapse.\" However, Martine Piccart-Gebhart, MD, PhD, of the Jules Bordet Institute in Brussels, said the study is \"too small to suggest the discontinuation of trastuzumab after 36 months,\" a sentiment echoed by many in attendance at the session. Piccart-Gebhart also noted that although seeing the characteristics that may be tied to durable complete remission, the study was \"far too small to draw conclusions about clinical subgroups most likely to achieve long-term remission.\" Still, she said, Gullo's is the first report on the long-term use of trastuzumab in the advanced setting, and it \"points to the existence\" of HER2-positive tumors that are \"truly addicted to HER2,\" as they show long-lasting remission under the therapy. Gullo said there's a need for further study of molecular and cytogenetic profiles of these tumors in order to better target which patients may be more likely to achieve durable complete remission on trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCo...  MJ '98 Stage 2 ER+/PR-/Her-, AC+Tam: Sep 08 bone/liver mets.

The consensus is generally to use the least toxic therapy first.   Since your mets are limited, you have the wonderful option of being on a limited toxicity therapy first (anti-hormonals).  I know it feels very different from most people's treatment as an early stage 1 or 2, but it is a very reasonable option to do. My favorite saying is you are in a marathon, not a sprint.  Make the most of your (hopefully many many) years to come.",

Here is the time sequence for the study as I understand it. I could be wrong, I'm still gathering information. After your first line of chemo (for me Abraxane) fails, they extract some of your T cells from your body. They somehow train these to focus back on your tumor (the HER2 and CD3 part). Then you take your 2nd line chemo (like Xeloda or Doxil or whatever). After 4 months of that, they give you a big dose of cytoxan (the lymphodepleting part of the study), in order to prep your body to accept an infusion of your new & improved T cells. They don't want your old T cells competing against the new & improved T cells. A week after the cytoxan dose, the infuse the new & improved T cells back into your body (over a course of several weeks). Here's a blurb I was able to find on adoptive T cell therapies in general, that can explain it better than I can: mayoresearch.mayo.edu/ciip/pro... Dr. Knutson is leading a research program focused on adoptive T-cell therapy for cancer patients at Mayo Clinic. His goal is to bring an effective adoptive T-cell therapy for breast and ovarian cancers to clinical trial, a logical extension of recent research that has been done in his laboratory and other laboratories. Researchers have successfully generated T-cell immunity to this protein using vaccines. Unfortunately, tumors suppress the natural expansion of HER-2/neu-specific T-cells--thus limiting their numbers and potential strength as a vaccine. Dr. Knutson and his colleagues are bypassing this limiting feature by removing these T-cells from the body, boosting their numbers and function in the cell culture dish--and then infusing the \"bulked up\" T-cells back in the body to fight disease. Why this study instead of a standard therapy? Because I hope it works. Even if it only works for 6 months or so, that is 6 months that I might not have otherwise. If/when this therapy fails, I can always go back to the standard Xeloda / Vinolribene / Doxil / Gemzar / whatever is next. Two years is one standard time frame for a research study to followup its participants. They have to specify something in order for the study to get approved through all the different regulatory bodies. I'm sure they would be interested in following people longer, if they are willing to stay in touch.",

      "Content": "Apr 25, 2011 03:35PM - edited Apr 25, 2011 03:37PM by MJLToday Here's the layperson's information from an article they gave me: Dr. Lum's promising new treatments go beyond his original goal. In addition to enhancing immune systems, he recently developed a strategy that uses antibodies to redirect the T cells to target specific tumors. The development of this targeting platform represents a significant step in the immunologic fight against cancer. The platform technology of Dr. Lum's work involves chemically linking two antibodies (to create a bispecific antibody) that binds to T cells and tumor cells to form a killing bridge between the T cells of the body's immune system and the tumor. Dr. Lum's initial clinical studies show that these bispecific antibodies retargeted to T cells can kill tumors and stimulate the patient's own immune system to develop long-term immunity directed at breast cancers in breast cancer patients. \"The T cells of our immune system mount a very strong anti-tumor response,\" Dr. Lum says. It's a type of cleanup treatment after other standard types of therapy. You can engineer targeted T cells that attack and break up specific tumors. Then the broken-up tumor is digested by other cells. \"The protein fragments from the cancer cells killed by the T cells and the immune proteins released by the T cells attract the immune cells of the body leading to vaccination of the patient's immune system. This would lead to long-term memory of the T cells.\" \"Creating an immune system response to cancer is a new development, and it's been a difficult nut to crack,\" Dr. Lum says. \"It will probably supplement the standard therapies patients receive. We can't expect to hit a home run with immunotherapy itself. It's not likely to cure patients with large tumors, but it can play an important role in cleaning up a microscopic tumor after surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy.\" Dr. Lum's clinical trials using immunotherapy treatments are promising. In one trial, patients with incurable Stage IV metastatic breast cancer who received infusions of activated T cells had an overall survival rate nearly four times longer than patients who received conventional treatment. Several significant grants support his research, among them $2.4 million from the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute and $300,000 from the Susan G. Komen for the Cure. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society awarded two separate translational grants (one for targeting non-Hodgkin's lymphomas after stem cell transplant and one for boosting immunity to multiple myeloma cancer stem cells prior to stem cell transplantation) to support Dr. Lum's work. The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society called him \"a talented scientist who our expert advisors deem most likely to make the basic science and clinical discoveries.\" \"I was totally surprised and blown away by those comments,\" Dr. Lum says. \"I've just been plugging away at my research all these years. It's quite humbling to be thought of as a researcher likely to make a dent against cancer.\"",

      "Content": "MJLToday wrote: My T-cells are being sent off to boot camp! I went to the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit last week, and started the preliminary part of this trial: They take out your T cells through a process called pheresis on your initial visit. Then, 3-4 months later, you come back and have those T cells infused into your body. In the meantime, they do a process on your T cells where they come back \"armed and activated\". The process is kind of complicated, and it involves using HER cells as targets, even though the patient is HER negative (I am only a +1 on the HER scale). Right now the trial is targeted at people who are between treatments - I had ended my first chemo as a mets patient (Abraxane) and hadn't yet started the second one (Xeloda). I think the clinicaltrials page specifies that you have to be between line one and line two, but they have modified the protocol so that you can between 2 and 3, and 3 and 4, if you wish. Also, they are planning on expanding access in the near future to people who are \"stable on chemo\" - you don't have be between chemos. If you PM me I can give you my contact information, or you can just call or email the Karmanos clinical trial people yourself. Again it is only for HER2 NEGATIVE metsters, even though it targets the HER2 cells. The worst part so far has been the travel, and the prospect of more travel and significant time away from home. When you go back for the infusion, you take a standardized dose of Cytoxan. Then 7 days later you go back for your first T cell infusion, then again the next week and the next week. Then you get a booster infusion four months later. You are also supposed to have a travel and treatment companion with you, so that you can have adult supervision for 24 hours after the infusion. Although it is an outpatient procedure, there is a chance of serious significant side effects especially in those first 24 hours. I've been using my frequent flyer miles, and they have an inexpensive guest housing on the medical center campus. I am also going to apply to drivingmissdarby.org for reimbursement of travel funds, if they have some available. If anyone has questions you can PM me or ask on this thread. They are definitely looking for more participants, and the coordinators and doctors have been easy to work with, even long distance. MJ '98 Stage 2 ER+/PR-/Her-, AC+Tam: Sep 08 bone/liver mets.

I did talk with Dr. Lum today and he is running another similar trial for early (stage 2 and 3) BC patients, to do this as part of a neo-adjuvant chemo treatment.  First you would do chemo, then the T cells, then surgery / radiation.  The trick is to catch people before they have any other treatment, chemo or surgery, to sign up for the study. THe cool thing about the study is they can study your residual tumor and get results for a relatively small group of people (50-some) ) and determine effectiveness within a year or less.  That is an easier way than the standard phase 3 studies, where you have to follow people for years to determine  if the drug or treatment works. If you know anyone newly brand-new diagnosed, Her2 negative,  biopsy only, within easy travel to Detroit, tell them to contact the folks at Karmanos for more information.  I think it is a low-risk, potentially high-return type of study. www.karmanos.org/app.asp?id=12...  clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NC... ",

      "Content": "MJLToday wrote: So why aren't there more trials going on?  :( www.breastcancer.org/treatment...  SAN ANTONIO (MedPage Today) -- Treatment with a drug that inhibits DNA repair in cancer cells improved breast cancer patients' survival by almost 60% when added to conventional chemotherapy, according to results from an ongoing study. Patients who received the investigational drug BSI-201 in addition to chemotherapy had a median survival of 12.2 months compared with 7.7 months for chemotherapy alone. The survival benefit came with no added toxicity, Joyce O'Shaughnessy, MD, of Baylor Sammons Cancer Center in Dallas, reported at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. \"The results were spectacular,\" said Peter Ravdin, MD, of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and a member of the symposium program committee. \"Previously reported data from the study showed a 16% response rate with chemotherapy, which is what one would expect,\" he added during an interview. \"The response rate with the PARP inhibitor was 48%, quite a striking difference. In addition, the responses lasted longer, three months with chemotherapy and seven months in patients treated with the combination.\" \"In many instances, increased response rates do not translate into increased survival,\" said Ravdin, who was not involved with the study. \"In this case it did, and the survival difference was quite striking.\" The findings confirm and extend results reported at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, when survival was more than nine months with BSI-201 plus chemotherapy, versus less than six months with chemotherapy alone. BSI-201 is the first of a new class of agents that inhibit cancer cells' DNA-repair mechanisms. BSI-201 inhibits the nuclear enzyme PARP1, which is involved in multiple cellular processes, including DNA repair, O'Shaughnessy and colleagues said in a poster presentation. The enzyme is upregulated in primary breast cancer and other types of cancer. Clinical studies have shown that BSI-201 enhances chemotherapy-induced DNA damage, and the agent has proven to be safe and well tolerated when combined with several different chemotherapy regimens (ASCO 2009, Abstract 3579). Preclinical studies have suggested that combining a PARP inhibitor with gemcitabine (Gemzar) and with platinum agents leads to additive therapeutic activity. O'Shaughnessy and colleagues reported findings from a Phase II study to determine whether adding BSI-201 to gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy would increase the clinical benefit, compared with chemotherapy alone, in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (estrogen-receptor, progesterone-receptor, and HER2 negative). The analysis involved 123 patients who received gemcitabine and carboplatin and were randomized to BSI-201 or no additional therapy. The patients' age was in the mid-50s, and most had ECOG 0 performance status. Most of the patients had more than one metastatic site. About 60% had received neoadjuvant systemic therapy, while about a third had received one or two therapies for metastatic disease, and more than half had prior exposure to a taxane and an anthracycline. The survival difference translated into a hazard ratio of 0.50 in favor of the BSI-201 arm (95% CI 0.30 to 0.82, P=0.005). The frequency of hematologic and nonhematologic adverse events did not differ significantly between treatment groups. The conventional chemotherapy accounted for most of the toxicity, researchers said. The study was supported by sanofi-aventis. The authors reported no disclosures.

Sorry for the downer, but invasive BC (stage 1 and above) is never considered cured, until the patient dies of something else, disease free. ",

I went to the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit last week, and started the preliminary part of this trial: They take out your T cells through a process called pheresis on your initial visit. Then, 3-4 months later, you come back and have those T cells infused into your body. In the meantime, they do a process on your T cells where they come back \"armed and activated\". The process is kind of complicated, and it involves using HER cells as targets, even though the patient is HER negative (I am only a +1 on the HER scale). Right now the trial is targeted at people who are between treatments - I had ended my first chemo as a mets patient (Abraxane) and hadn't yet started the second one (Xeloda). I think the clinicaltrials page specifies that you have to be between line one and line two, but they have modified the protocol so that you can between 2 and 3, and 3 and 4, if you wish. Also, they are planning on expanding access in the near future to people who are \"stable on chemo\" - you don't have be between chemos. If you PM me I can give you my contact information, or you can just call or email the Karmanos clinical trial people yourself. Again it is only for HER2 NEGATIVE metsters, even though it targets the HER2 cells. The worst part so far has been the travel, and the prospect of more travel and significant time away from home. When you go back for the infusion, you take a standardized dose of Cytoxan. Then 7 days later you go back for your first T cell infusion, then again the next week and the next week. Then you get a booster infusion four months later. You are also supposed to have a travel and treatment companion with you, so that you can have adult supervision for 24 hours after the infusion. Although it is an outpatient procedure, there is a chance of serious significant side effects especially in those first 24 hours. I've been using my frequent flyer miles, and they have an inexpensive guest housing on the medical center campus. I am also going to apply to drivingmissdarby.org for reimbursement of travel funds, if they have some available. If anyone has questions you can PM me or ask on this thread. They are definitely looking for more participants, and the coordinators and doctors have been easy to work with, even long distance. MJ '98 Stage 2 ER+/PR-/Her-, AC+Tam: Sep 08 bone/liver mets.

      "Content": "MJLToday wrote: Ran into this, I hope it helps someone. Ann Oncol. 2009 Oct 29. [Epub ahead of print] Activity of fulvestrant in HER2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer. Robertson JF, Steger GG, Neven P, Barni S, Gieseking F, Nolè F, Pritchard KI, O'Malley FP, Simon SD, Kaufman B, Petruzelka L. Professorial Unit of Surgery, Division of Breast Surgery, University of Nottingham, Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham, UK. BACKGROUND: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression increases the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells resulting in poorer prognosis. Patients with HER2-positive disease are less responsive to endocrine therapies. Trastuzumab monotherapy results in objective responses in only approximately 15% of patients. Fulvestrant retains activity in cells overexpressing HER2 that are resistant to other endocrine treatments. This retrospective study evaluated response to fulvestrant treatment among HER2-positive patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical experience data from 10 treatment centres were pooled. Postmenopausal patients with predominantly hormone receptor-positive and HER2-positive disease were included. Clinical benefit (CB) was defined as the proportion of patients achieving a response to treatment (partial or complete) or stable disease lasting >/=6 months. RESULTS: Data for 102 patients were analysed. Fulvestrant resulted in an overall CB rate of 42% (43/101) in HER2-positive patients and 40% (25/63) in patients with visceral disease. Median duration of treatment was 14.5 months (range 6-44 months). Fulvestrant showed activity up to the fourth line of endocrine therapy and up to the seventh line of overall therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that fulvestrant may be a suitable treatment option in extensively pre-treated patients with HER2-positive, hormone receptor-positive ABC. Further exploration of its use in this patient population is warranted. PMID: 19875750  MJ '98 Stage 2 ER+/PR-/Her-, AC+Tam: Sep 08 bone/liver mets.

The largest tumor size went from 8.something in the spring, to 9.something in later summer after Xeloda not working, to 10.something a month later. Also, many of my liver enzyme numbers have elevated substantially, so it is time to fish or cut bait. The chemo could still work synergestically with the T-cells to shrink the tumor cells, so only time will tell on that. My scheduled booster infusion the first week of December has been postponed until a future time. I did Taxotere / Gemzar last Monday 10/10/11, and did OK until the prednisone pre- and co-meds ran out. I feel like I've been hit by the Tax truck. Shaved my head in anticipation of the latest bald-o-rama. My 6 yr old boys were so excitied to see my in a mohawk, I was just sure they were going to do it themselves on their own. I told them they had to check with daddy which always puts a damper on fun activities. Saturday and Sunday the mouth and throat pain took over. It's really hard to function when you can't yell like you are used to LOL, and L still loves being read to. He's not a real logical 6 yr old. I've been continuing on the low / medium level of mystery fever. Monday I went in to the oncologist's for the next dose of Gemzar only and a blood count booster shot (Neuopegen) Between the mystery fever and low blood count, they wanted me to be admitted to the hospital.

But then as I hang around here and read and exprerience more, I realize a few things. 1)  Two months are two glorious months you might not have had previously. 2) The two months is an average or median.  Some people are total non-responders to that particular drug -- they will wash out of the trial quickly.  The people who DO respond, often respond for longer than that.  So, the two months for the responders are more likely to be 4, 6,8 or even more months they wouldn't have had. 3) Drug companies \"power\" or size their studies to show the minimum necessary to get a drug approved.  Even just a slight improvement in progression free OR overall survival will get the FDA OK.  The drug companies  aren't out to sell the drugs to us by proving how wonderful the drug is  in trials -- if it's approved, we're gonna take it.  It's not like a new car or something we really have a choice with LOL.  So they recruit the fewest people (aka cheapest trial) it takes, to gain approval.  Chances are the drug is MORE effective than that minimum.  4) People in trials take scans more often than your average bird -- often every 6 weeks.  Another reason they might get kicked out of the trial \"early\" for non-response, vs. in every day use. Yes it's depression, but there is still reason for hope.",

I think that's up to you and your DH to decide, if your family needs it. I have heard good things about some of the programs, that kids have benefited from being able to talk to trained counselors and/or peers that are going through similar situations.  Kind of like a support group for kids, KWIM? They probably don't want to talk with you about some things, in that they might not want you to stress about it.  So it might be helpful.  I wish there were something in my area, as my kids get older.  Mine are just now 4 yrs old.

      "Content": "MJLToday wrote: http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/732891?src=mpnews&spon=7&uac=33910HT  November 19, 2010 - The novel biologic agent denosumab (XGEVA, Amgen) has received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to prevent skeletal-related events in cancer patients with solid tumors and bone metastases. The same drug is marketed under the trade name Prolia for postmenopausal osteoporosis, an indication the FDA approved in June. It is used at 2 different doses for these 2 indications. In cancer patients with bone metastases, the drug is administered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 120 mg every 4 weeks for the prevention of skeletal-related events; for postmenopausal osteoporosis, it is administered at a dose of 60 mg every 6 months. The new biologic is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to RANK ligand, a protein found on osteoclasts and involved in bone breakdown. It is a first-in-class therapeutic - which in pharmaceutical drug development commands a price premium - but it is entering therapeutic domains that have been, to date, dominated by bisphosphonates. Denosumab has shown superiority over the bisphosphonate zolendronic acid in 2 of 3 trials that tested the agents head to head in cancer patients with bone metastases. The biologic was significantly better at reducing skeletal-related events in a large trial of breast cancer patients (published online November 8 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology and reported by Medscape Medical News), and in a large trial of prostate cancer patients (to date only presented at meetings). In the third trial, conducted in patients with advancer cancer, excluding breast and prostate cancer, the difference did not reach statistical significance, but there was a trend toward superiority. \"The magnitude of the benefit was similar in all of the trials,\" said Matthew Smith, MD, who headed the prostate cancer trial. \"There was a consistency across all of the tumor types,\" he told Medscape Medical News. \"The aim of these therapies is to reduce skeletal-related events, and here we have level 1 evidence,\" Dr. Smith reported. \"I would certainly want to use the most effective treatment.\" Denosumab also has 2 other advantages, Dr. Smith noted. It is administered subcutaneously, which is more convenient than the intravenous administration required for zolendronic acid, he said. This allows it to be used in patients who otherwise might not receive treatment; for example, prostate cancer patients with bone metastases often do not receive bone-targeted therapy because urologists are often not set up to administer intravenous agents. The adverse-effect profile is also different. \"There are no concerns about renal safety with denosumab, so there are no requirements for renal monitoring, which is a key requirement for bisphosphonate treatment,\" Dr. Smith said. Also, there are fewer acute-phase reactions with denosumab. The risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw is similar with both drugs, and although the incidence rate of adverse effects is low with both drugs, it is something that needs to be looked out for, he added. Extent of Clinical Impact? When these data on reducing skeletal-related events in cancer patients with bone metastases were reported last year, an expert not involved in any of the trials said that she was \"not overwhelmed by the new data.\" Joanne Mortimer, MD, from the City of Hope in Duarte, California, also said that the bisphosphonates have already had a huge impact on the natural history of this complication. \"Twenty-five years ago, we were seeing hips that needed replacement and spinal compression, but we don't see these serious complications when we use bisphosphonates,\" she said. In the United States, intravenous pamidronate (Aredia) is used as well as zolendronic acid; in Europe, oral ibandronate (Boniva) is used. However, Dr. Smith disagreed to some extent. Bisphosphonates are well established as treatment for patients with bone metastases who have breast cancer and multiple myeloma, he said, but their use in other tumor types is less well established, and many patients go untreated. This is particularly true for prostate cancer patients, he added. Up to \"70% of patients with prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone are not currently receiving therapy to prevent complications from these bone metastases,\" said Neal Shore, MD, FACS, medical director at the Carolina Urologic Researcher Center, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. This might be because urologists are not comfortable in administering, or lack the facilities in which to administer, intravenous agents, he said in a statement issued by Amgen. \"As many as 3 out of 4 patients with advanced prostate, lung, and breast cancer will experience spread to their bones. Despite the availability of current treatments, a significant proportion of these patients still experience bone complications or are not candidates for existing treatment,\" David Henry, MD, clinical professor of medicine at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, said in the same statement. \"Based on the compelling science and robust clinical evidence seen with denosumab, I expect this new option to quickly become a mainstay of cancer care and to play an important role in reducing the incidence of debilitating bone complications in patients with advanced cancer,\" he said. Dr. Henry was involved in the trial of denosumab conducted in tumor types other than breast and prostate cancer. High Price Tag Denosumab has been launched with a high price tag. XGEVA will cost $1650 monthly (based on wholesale acquisition costs), the manufacturer noted. Perhaps anticipating that its high price will be an issue, Amgen has launched a program to help patients meet deductible, coinsurance, and/or copayment requirements. Under its XGEVA FIRST STEP Coupon Program, eligible patients will incur no out-of-pocket costs for their initial denosumab dose, and will then pay a maximum of $25 for subsequent injections.

Those of us that HAVE gone through extensive treatments, and are afraid of the physical damage of resuscitation -- broken ribs, etc., that I understand.If you feel you only have months to go, then I guess that makes sense. But,I have a question to those of us that haven't been through that many treatments, and are still in reasonably good shape. A serious question, not being snarky. How is resuscitation, from a heart attack or motor vehicle accident, different from continuing treatment? Going on to the next round of chemo or anti-hormonal or radiation or whatever is the next thing that our oncologists suggest?",

Another site that is more comprehensive, but less user friendly, is clinicaltrials.gov.  You can do a search on metastatic HER2 breast cancer, for instance, but you will get a lot of hits that you will need to go through.   Here's a listing of the TDM-1 trials mentioned above: clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results...   Best wishes to your entire family.",

      "Content": "MJLToday wrote: I just wanted to let everyone know about a cool new immune system treatment clinical trial that has come out. I am participating in the version for metastatic patients, but there is also a version for newly diagnosed stage 2 and 3 patients with medium sized and larger tumors (2 cm and larger). It is only being done at Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit, MI, so you would need to live near or travel there in order to participate. You have to be HER2 negative. I think the info below says triple negative, but Dr. Lum says they have changed that to any hormonal status. You DO have to be newly diagnosed, biopsy ONLY, and able to take neoadjuvant treatment (chemo before surgery and/or radiation). They are having trouble recruiting patients for the study because not that many people get neoadjuvant chemo, though it is considered as effective as chemo done after surgery. Plus, if you get a lumpectomy, you might get better looking surgical results if the chemo and immune system treatment shrink the tumor before surgery. The timeline is that after your are diagnosed with a biopsy, you sign-up in person in Detroit for the trial. Then they do a \"pheresis\" where they take out some of your T-cells from your blood, and put the rest of your blood back. T-cells are a part of your immune system that helps you to fight cancer. The idea is to make them stronger to help you to fight the cancer better, after your chemo is completed. You get the standard TAC (Taxol, Adriamycin and Cytoxan) treatment wherever is convenient to you, either in Detroit or at your local oncologist's office or hospital. In the mean time, the laboratory people go do their magic of taking your T-cells and changing them into armed, activated T-cells. When you are done with the TAC, you go back to Karmanos for four weekly infusions of your new, hopefully improved T-cells. Finally, you get your surgery with or without radiation (depending on your doctor's recommendations), AFTER the chemo and T-cell immunotherapy. It is possible to travel to participate in this study. I've traveled (flown) about 1,000 miles each way from the southern Midwest to Detroit four times now, with a 5th visit planned for a booster in December. It hasn't been easy, but it's not impossible either. Whether or not you travel, you WILL need an adult treatment buddy to drive you to Karmanos, be with you most of the day, and take you home and look after you overnight. You must stay within a 30 minute drive of the Detroit Medical Center, even overnight, in case of a serious side effect. The actual treatment itself is hard the day of, but within 24 hrs you are mostly back to normal. I think mine was a little harder than most, because I'm allergic to Demerol which they typically give to help dampen the flu-like reaction (fever, low blood pressure, shaking chills, sometimes nausea/vomiting). The first T-cell treatment is the hardest, which is just the opposite of how chemo works in my experience. This study is very cool scientifically, because the researchers can go in and look at any left-over tumor to see what kind of immune system response the patient has to the T-cell infusions, especially in killing tumor stem cells. So, they get timely feedback on potential effectiveness, instead of having to wait years to see if patients have any recurrences. It is a phase 2 study, which means that safety has been established, but not effectiveness. If you know someone who is newly diagnosed (biopsy only) and HER2 negative who would be interested in this trial, please let them know about this. Here is info from Karmanos web site: http://www.karmanos.org/view_news.asp?id=779 and the technical information from clinicaltrials.gov http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01147016?term=t+cells+breast+cancer&rank=4 If you have specific questions from a patient's point of view, please send me a private message through this message board. If you have questions about the treatment itself and your potential eligibility, please contact the study coordinators: Pat Steele 313-576-8721 or steelep@karmanos.org; and Karen Myers 313-576-8384 or myersk@karmanos.org.

Don't flinch away from the hard conversations, if she starts them.  If she wants to talk about her fears, dying, her funeral plans, either help her with these practicalities, or just listen.   Tell her you will help when the time comes. Hopefully it will be many years before she has to deal with those physical realities, but sometimes a person at this stage needs to assert control over her worries of the future. Thanks.",

On a philosophical note, I think it's interesting how HER2 positive has turned from a curse of a very aggressive disease, to almost a blessing because of the (relatively) more effective targeted therapies -- Herceptin, TDM1, Tykerb, and now pertuzumab.   I understand that not everyone responds to these drugs, and that brain mets especially are an issue since so many of these drugs don't pass the blood/brain barrier.  But it's still very exciting to see SOME progress for some of us.  ",

The correct label for your disease state now is \"metastatic\" or \"Stage 3 with metastatic recurrence\", not \"Stage IV\".  Hopefully you will soon go back to, and long stay at, NED (no evidence of disease).  But you will always be a metster now.  Welcome to club mets, the club no one wants to join.  But is the only club that will have me :D Sometimes the labels do matter, if you are looking at survival statistics and such, but as previous posters have said, the treatment options are pretty much the same, except you don't usually recycle anything you have had recently, if you have been recently diagnosed at a lower stage.  ",

So, is a 30 year survival being \"cured\"?  Or is it dying of something non-cancer and non-treatment related?",

In 3 separate randomized trials, adding bevacizumab to various commonly used chemotherapy regimens resulted in significantly improved overall response rate and time to progression. These beneficial effects were consistently found in all 3 trials and in all subgroups examined, he pointed out. \"Anecdotally, bevacizumab combinations can produce dramatic responses in individual patients, and it is my clinical impression that responses of such quality are seldom seen with the same chemotherapy programs without bevacizumab. As a frequent user of this agent, I have also found that it is very well tolerated by the great majority of patients; in very few do I need to modify dose or schedule, and in even fewer do I need to discontinue treatment because of toxicities.\" However, a \"puzzling observation\" in all 3 studies is the total absence of a survival benefit - \"the survival curves of the control and bevacizumab arms were entirely superimposable,\" Dr. Hortobagyi said. It is difficult to demonstrate a significant survival benefit in first-line therapy of metastatic breast cancer, because such benefit is often diluted by multiple subsequent treatments and crossover designs, he explained, but \"we often see some separation of the curves, even if the difference doesn't reach statistical significance.\" \"In the trials in question, and as you would expect simply by chance, some parts of the bevacizumab curves were slightly above and others slightly below the control-arm curves. While none of these differences (whether positive or negative) were statistically significant, the FDA reviewer elected to present them in an incredibly biased manner, where positive (but nonsignificant) survival differences were labeled 'no difference,' and negative (also nonsignificant) differences were labeled as favoring the placebo arm,\" Dr. Hortobagyi explained. \"This either denotes ignorance of common statistical methods or an underlying agenda to place the agent in an unfavorable perspective. There were other surprising statements made by the FDA reviewer attributing certain toxicities to bevacizumab, when in fact those toxicities are well recognized as being associated with the underlying chemotherapy. For instance, bowel perforations are a well-recognized complication of taxanes, especially docetaxel; angina and myocardial infarction are reported complications of capecitabine; and congestive heart failure is a well-known complication of anthracyclines (doxorubicin and epirubicin),\" he continued. \"The FDA reviewer continuously referred to these complications as bevacizumab-related, creating an artificially high bevacizumab-related mortality rate in the minds of ODAC members,\" Dr. Hortobagyi said. He summarized the outcome of the meeting as follows: \"ODAC members found the benefit of bevacizumab insufficient in view of the toxicities listed by both the sponsor and the FDA reviewer, and based on that belief, they felt that the 2 new trials failed to confirm the encouraging results of E2100, and that there was insufficient efficacy to expand or even maintain the metastatic breast cancer indication of bevacizumab.\" However, he added that \"during the discussion, I got the strong impression that several ODAC members had a poor understanding of clinical trials and statistics (based on some of the questions that were somewhat bizarre!), and that very few had any experience using bevacizumab in the clinic. Otherwise, they would have known that the frequent toxicities reported on paper caused few symptoms and actually did not affect quality of life, and perhaps they would have seen the response and progression-free survival benefits in a different light.\" \"I thought that the discussion brought to light some issues in the process. The sponsor complied entirely with the FDA's requests when accelerated approval was granted; however, the FDA instructions were vague, and the 'magnitude of benefit' was never defined. Despite the fact that the FDA never requested prolongation of survival, much of the discussion by ODAC members was based on this lack of survival benefit. Therefore, there was a major disconnect between the FDA and ODAC,\" Dr. Hortobagyi explained. \"Ultimately, ODAC members acted on their understanding of the risk/benefit ratio of the drug, and recommended removal of the metastatic breast cancer indication. I think this was the wrong recommendation, although witnessing the process I can see how inadequate instruction by the FDA, unfamiliarity with the drug, and a biased presentation by the FDA reviewer led to this result,\" he said. \"I am concerned, in part, because this recommendation might remove an important treatment option from patients with metastatic breast cancer. I am also concerned because 'clinical benefit' remains poorly defined. This precedent will set many drugs currently under development up for failure. It would be important for the FDA to clearly define expectations from sponsors and provide clear guidance to ODAC members, so that disconnects such as those observed during this discussion stop happening,\" Dr. Hortobagyi told Medscape Medical News. Dr. Perez reports serving on steering committees for Bayer HealthCare and Genentech, and on an independent monitoring committee for Novartis. Dr. Hortobagyi was at the meeting as a consultant to Genentech, for which he will receive an honorarium, and also had travel and accommodation paid for by the company; he has disclosed no other relevant financial relationships.",
