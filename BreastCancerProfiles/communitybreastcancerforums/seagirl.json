Yesterday I felt pretty good, just a little sluggish. But today, day 3, I am TIRED I haven't wanted to do anything. I am giving myself Neupogen injections --not easy for me--- .I'm worried about doing it correctly. is anyone else doing them? does it get easier? I'm hoping that tomorrow will be better and I will have energy for work on Monday & Tuesday. I am so thankful for this board, it helps to know what others are experiencing. Dee4c I love your hat with the hair piece. I am getting anxious to get head coverings before I start losing my hair. I live in L.A. so don't usually wear hats in the winter, but I guess I will have a new style this year! wishing everyone well",

Thanks to everyone for posting their experiences, going through these posts tonight has made me feel better. No one has told me about Claritin or Benedryl do you take that before you go? Or after when you feel effects ?",

I was holding on too long (I'm a teacher and was hoping to get through parent conferences with hair.....oh well) I had my hubby shave it last Monday (I let my daughter ,9 , give me a custom haircut first. I told her it would be her only chance to cut my hair it was very punk rock) Here is me a couple of weeks before:  Here I am after the buzz cut:   My hubby had a shaved head already, now my daughter has a matching set of parents! Anyway wish I hadn't waited so long, it wasn't worth the stress and anticipation. My first graders were very curious when I came in with a hat. (wig had not arrived yet) I got funny looks, comments and questions: What kind of haircut did you get???? I don't want to be mean....but are you bald??? Take off your hat!!! I like it. Can I touch it? you look younger...(i think he was thinking of his baby sister) It will grow back...I shave mine every summer and look how long it is now I think.....you should get a wig. LOL too funny. Hope everyone is feeling well. I apologize for the size of this....had a tricky time with the pictures.",

Then after chemo on Thursday, I felt pretty UGH. Today I finally felt better. Still can't taste anything and have no appetite, which I think adds to this listless feeling. Marcella, your rant brought tears to my eyes. Never feel bad about sharing your feelings here, we all understand. For someone so young you seem to be handling this all with such grace. We all have those days, mine was Sunday....feeling sorry for myself asking \"why me\" and \"what if\". but we need to just get back up and be positive.So glad you are going to New York way to celebrate the new year! Midlifecriseis, I hope those antibiotics start working soon. I'm sorry you are going through that, its bad enough that our hair falls out! Sheeba, I've had a little fogginess as well. I am a big reader but can barely focus on my book. Im trying to get a little exercise everyday which seems to help and has been helping me sleep better as well. I haven't had any nosebleeds yet...but now I'm watching for them. Hope everyone having chemo this week has little side effects. Hugs to all",

You all look beautiful with your shaved heads. I will be shaving it off tomorrow so I will post some pics. My hair has been coming out in handfuls ...I was hoping for a few more days but it is not gonna happen.I was sad about it last night but you all inspired me. I also looked at the hair forum where people have posted photos of their hair GROWTH and realized that this is just a small period of time. I am looking forward to when we share photos of our hair growing in--it will be here before we know it. Bonnied, my taste buds changed too but then after about a week it got better. I hope it is the same for you. I wish all of having chemo this week an easy time with minimal side effects. Just remember each time we go we are closer to the end.  ",

My last 2 chemo have left me fatigued. but I only have one more to go! Congrats to everyone who has finished up their treatments. I will be interested to see how you are all bouncing back and dealing with your next steps. Dee4c, I hope your rads continue to go ok. Did anyone else get numbness in their feet? This just happened to me after my 5th round and after a week it is still there I have a call into my Onc. I was wondering if anyone had those symptons and if they resolved after your last chemo. It makes me nervous about my 6th round coming up. Hoping that all are doing well ",
