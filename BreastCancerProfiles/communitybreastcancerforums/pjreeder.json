It's been a few years, and I hope there has been no recurrence in your life. I had an oncotype score of 50. I'm here 9 years later. I hope this helps you. I had the same size and type of cancer you had. Stage IIB Grade 3--one micrometastises sentinel node. The doctor wondered if she should have taken out more nodes after surgery was over. I didn't want her to go back in and said no. So, I don't know if more nodes were positive or not. I know I had to wait six weeks for surgery, and I always wondered if those biopsies and the long wait made stuff spread. Anyway, I'm here 9 years later after chemo and no radiation. Chose not to have radiation because of autoimmune problems. And I couldn't take Femara, Arimidex or Tamoxifen. Just too hard on the body. I tried. And nine years later----I'm here. I hope you are as well, and doing fine.",
