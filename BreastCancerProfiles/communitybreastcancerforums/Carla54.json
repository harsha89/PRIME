She went through radiotherapy and chemo..they suspected she was a brca carrier and the results came back positive in 2015. I did the test and I also carry the BRCA 1 mutation. She had a double mastectomy in 2016 in order to prevent any reoccurrence. I'm so relieved for her, knowing she will be fine now. I had my first big check up at the end of last month (mammogram, US, MRI) and the MRI found something suspicious (not seen on the mammogram or the US) it's 3mms so very small but I'm still scrared because my mom's tumour was only 6mms and still very aggressive... I'm counting my blessings: living in France, being taken care of in one the best breast cancer center in the country, having no bills to pay for all of this. And my family being very supportive. But I'm just sick of this never ending anxiety since my mom got diagnosed in 2012. I just want this to be over and have a normal life. My usual doctor at the center is not here in July (us French people have a lot of vacations ;) ). I have an appointment with her at the beginning of August and she is supposed to give me all the results at this moment. The center told me that if there was anything wrong with the biopsy they would call me earlier, probably this week, to have an appointment with an other doctor. So I'm here. Waiting all day by the phone, hoping it doesn't ring...if by the end of the week I have no call, I will call them in order to know if everything's ok. Juste wanted to share my story...

I'm so relieved. Thinking now about having a double mastectomy with reconstruction in order to not have to go through this every year.",
