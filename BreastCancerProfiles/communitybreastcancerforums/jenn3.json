In my case my onc can't say for sure, but he believes it was linked to the RH drugs I started taking in Oct 08.  He had just written a paper on the link between Humira and Breast Cancer, then shortly after my surgery it was all over the news with warnings.  I had no idea - my sister found the warning literally at the bottom of the page in smaller print.  I do believe we need better screenings - as my sister has very large dense breast and has to fight for more testing.  However, education in so many forms is needed.  First -cancer does hurt-terribly!  And..... is my cancer a result of the medication - I'll never know, but had I understood the warnings I feel like I could have made a decision based on all of the information - would I have still taken it - I don't know.  The onc told me that when medicaitons warn us that our immune systems will be compromised it doesn't just mean from viral and bacterial infections.  It also means that our bodies will not be able to fight cancer cells and other illnesses that attack our cellular system and organs.  I honestly had no idea that a compromised immune system meant it opened me up to cancer. We need better screening, teach self exams and education in so many ways.  We also need to make sure that we know we can question our doctors if we're not comfortable or change doctors.  As my grandfather used to say it's the practice of medicine - not an exact science.  This is not related to mammograms, but I have to share - the side in which I have cancer is the side that hair has never grown under the arm.  Is that a link of some sort?  Probably not, but strange......... ",

Right before I was dx'd (3 months) with my Stage IV dx I was talking to my onc about recon.  He could tell that I really wasn't mentally ready for another big surgery, one that would involve recovery time when I was feeling great.  He suggested I wait until I'm mentally - 100% ready to face surgery.  I am glad that I waited because of my dx 3 months later, but what he was telling me was that I needed to be ready and if there was any doubt - WAIT. If you make the decision to have surgery, ask the surgeon the \"clean up\" the dog ears left after a BMX, if you're not doing recon.  It's extra skin and tissue left under the arm areas, all women have it.  When we have breast it is not noticable because our breast naturally pull the tissue and skin forward.  Mine doesn't look bad and it doesn't show when I'm dressed, but it just annoys me.  Good luck with your decision, it's a hard one to make, but I know the right one will come to you soon.  (((hugs))) Jenn",

It took 8 hours to get the pain under control - 8 hours.  I am now taking pain meds every three hours no matter what and............the pain is finally under control.  OMG - this is a lot of pain medication.  Is this what I will have to live with?  I want to work, drive and continue to do as much as I can, but am worried I'll be on pain meds for the rest of my life.  I am meeting with the rad onc tomorrow, he works closely with my onc and is down the hall from him - I'm sure he'll work with me to help get the pain under control with rads. Then I see my onc again on Wed and I'm sure he'll change my meds again, but I am worried.  Does it get better - pain wise?  Will my body have to adjust to all of the pain medication?  I can't imagine living in a loopy world \"forever\"....... It's 4am, I'm rambling because of the pain meds, can't sleep and am due for more medication in an hour..........thanks for listening, reading and being there.

Ask your onc for the \"magic mouthwash\", mine called it Dukes Solution.  It soothes and numbs your mouth so that you can eat and drink.  Be sure to eat meals that are gentle and not too spicy.  And.........gentle salt water or baking soda with water mix will help cleanse and soothe your mouth. 2. Purchase Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash.  It is meant for dry/sore mouths, very gentle and has no alcohol or minty feeling that irritates the sores.  It was a lifesaver for me. 3. Stay away from acidic foods or drinks, spicy or really salty foods. 4. Keep your mouth moist.  You risk infection and other dental/gum problems if your mouth gets to dry.  The saliva helps keep your mouth hydrated and constantly cleanse away germs.  During this time, be sure to sip on water and swich it around your mouth often (incl. nighttime). Good luck and I hope you feel better soon.",

The vacation that was suggested may be just what you need.  Take a break from cancer, chemo and feeling down.  Sometimes even if our bodies are worn out, if we can be mentally revitalized we begin to feel better all over.

Jenn  I am terrible with jokes, but do have a funny story to share.  My DD#2 just told me this story two days ago.  My DD#2 attends college in a somewhat rural community, there are a lot of sportsmen, fishing, hunting, etc......  She has never been fishing, nor hunting.  Last year a group of friends decided to fishing off of a dock near campus.  She threw her line out into the water and low and behold she got a hit, a big one.  She of course starts screaming, \"I've got a fish\", \"what do I do\".  Her friends screams \"bring it in\" so not knowing how to bring the fish in she began to run down the dock with the fishing pole.  Needless to say everyone out there started laughing hysterically while trying to tell her to reel it in, not run down the dock and drag the fish out of the water.  I hope that the jokes and funny stories help bring a smile to your face.  More (((hugs)))))",

Jen - I think you're doing a great job of healing and moving on.  I remember when you first came to the boards you were so upset and it seemed to me that you wanted an answer that wasn't there and now look at you.  You're helping the other newbies, growing your business, traveling and livng your life - I'd say you've done a great job!",

My hair is still growing - I haven't looked at the back in a while, but it feels thicker and I'm told it's starting to curl some.  I've never had to deal with curly hair so this will be new experience as it gets longer.  The crown of my head is filling in, but still thinner than the rest of my head.  And...... I have eyebrows growing back in - the five o'clock shadow look.  I did pluck and remove the ones growing in the middle trying to give me the unibrow look and I did pluck a few tiny ones growing wildly on my eyelid.  My eyelashes are growing back - somewhat straight like others have mentioned and look really long in the 15x mirror, but when I tried mascara I couldn't get close enough. I too had facial hair show up, which I didn't have before.  I was on a mini vacation with my sister, freaked out grabbed her razor and shaved it all off.  It hasn't grown back.  My underarm hair hasn't grown back, down under is coming back and my leg hair is growing like crazy. ",

When I accidentally broke it and needed to replace it I tried several different brands, less expensive than the one I had gotten in class, but they just didn't work the same.  I ended up replacing the one I had, which was Lancome.  I found it looks the best, stays on all day and using that brush after drawing on the eyebrows helps it to blend and not look too harsh.  I hate not having eyebrows, but I would hate it more without the eyebrow pencil and brush.  I went to Sephora and looked at the kits where you could use a stencil to draw and shape, but there is no way I would have the patience for it and I tried the sample pencil and it was that waxy stuff that rubs off really easy. Mary - I had the same thing happen as you did.  My hair started to sprout and my eyebrows and lashes fell out - go figure.............. Judy - thank you - I need the patience fairy.",

Maybe your daughter doesn't know how to react, she's emotional because her harmones are out of whack from the pregnancy, her Mom that she loves and is close to was just diagnosed with cancer - it may be too much to handle and she's keeping her distance to avoid the pain she's dealing with.  If you were close and had a good relationship, then she will come around. She just needs to figure out how to handle pregnancy, a new baby and a Mom with cancer.  She'll be there - just give her time.  In the meantime (((HUGS))) and know that we're here and we \"get it\".",

I know with triple negative breast cancer \"it\" moves fast when the end comes near.  But why when it hits the brain of the TNBC patient does it move so much faster than elsewhere?  Why wouldn't the radiation slow things up a little?  From what I've heard, gathered and read it seems once \"it\" comes to the brain it's about 3 months, 6 months if lucky and a year is the jackpot.  Why?  I really, really want to make it at least until June.  We can get through the wedding for DD1, have some good months to laugh with DH, family and friends, and DD2 will have finished up this semester at home.  Then there is the summer to \"get used\" to me being gone, family and friends still take the wedding cruise that is paid for to get away from all they've been through, then DD2 can go back to school in the fall.  Wouldn't it be nice if things fell so neatly into place? Between death, steroids, no sleep and radiation I am such a lost soul, feeling like I'm bumping from one room to the other - I HATE this!!!!

Second, the PET scan may not show anything, then in three months I may have symtoms and will need that PET scan and may run into trouble with the insurance company.  She said for the most part if you're not having symptoms, aches or pains the onc doesn't go looking for it.  It seemed to make sense while she was telling me what their procedure is. Of course she suggested I run this all by my onc when I see him again. He may have different plans because each case is different. I am triple negative, grade 3 and have started to worry more a lot more lately.  I know this is normal as we start to end treatment, but I do worry.  Prior to having found BC I two ER visits back to back (and it had been 25 yrs since I had been in the ER) with unexplained pain in the abdomen and the only thing they found were increased liver counts, for which they couldn't explain because I don't drink and hadn't been drinking and all of the tests and scans came up clear.  I've also had a lot of rib pain in the last year that my rheumatologist can't explain - so now I'm thinking \"what if\" it's mets that have been missed all this time?  Through all of this I've been fine, upbeat plans to grow old in and wrinkly, but now I am terrified.  I want the PET scan, but at the same time I don't.  Oh the mental games this disease plays with us.................",

Edited:  I spoke to the oncologist.  He said the reason for not having the gamma knife at this time is because the tumor we want to focus on is too big.  I asked if it was a possibilty down the road, he said it wasn't his field, but we could address it later with the neurosurgeon and/or radiologist oncologist.   I also asked him about stopping chemo for good and why was that decided.  It was as I thought, but couldn't get the family to understand.  He is stopping it for now, he has to while I am doing radiation.  We will discuss chemo again after WBR and the follow scans.  He is thinking maybe Halaven or Ixempra (spelling wrong??).   So for now, we will do WBR, follow up scans, possible chemo in Feb. and hope for as much quality time as possible.  DD#1 is going to move her wedding date to March possibly with just family, but keeping the bigger ceremony scheduled in July (I don't want her to cancel that).  My youngest rearranged her college schedule for this semester so that she is doing online courses, she has plenty of support from the school, her professors and the family and hopefully will get back to both online and classroom in the Fall.  DH and I are going to wrap up the final crap we have to with the financial stuff, insurances, funeral home, obits etc and go from there.  I just hope things move a little slower so I have some more time to get things in order before I have to just let it go. ",

I was really hoping for some more time before progression and am at a loss for words.  I hate breast cancer and hate that I have triple negative breast cancer!!!

Either buy clothes for your children on sale only, at consignment shops or thrift stores.  When I was a single parent I still liked buying a good pair of shoes that lasted longer, than inexpensive shoes - in the long run it was more bang for the buck, but I did buy them on sale only.  I also tried an experiement with myself after reading an article and decided see how long I could go without buying new clothes........I did pretty good and found clothes I hadn't used in a while that were like new - some with tags. Food, find dishes that go a long way.  Spaghetti and meatsauce, Beans w/rice (southern thing), casserole dishes.  Cheaper cuts of meat, chicken legs, wings and thighs.  Buying the whole chicken and roasting it or cutting it up for other uses.  I also like to buy the already cooked chicken using the breast meat for chicken salad sandwiches for lunch and the dark meat for gumbo or soup.  Edited:  I just thought of something - homemade pizza, my kids used to love to make homemade pizza, it was fun and cheap.  The store brand dough is something like .79, the sauce is a little more goes a long way and stores well in the fridge, then you can top it with anything you or your children like. We've cut back a lot by not eating out as often, going to the movies, but only the maitinee and finding free things to entertain with.  I also cleaned out our office and found a boat load of supplies that my daughter could use in school, binders, notebooks, loose paper, pens.  Stuff that had gotten pushed to the back of the closet and forgotten about.    Cable/Internet/Phone - search for a less expensive provider or cut back on services Good topic - thanks for starting.",

I was dx'd June 19, 2009 with breast cancer, within two weeks I had a bi-lat masectomy, discovered it was triple negative and enrolled in a trial.  The trial was a combo of drugs I would have taken, but adding Avastin.  I ended up in the arm without the Avastin and was disappointed, but it is what it is. I did chemo from Aug - Dec of 09, rads in Feb/March (34 sessions) and was then NED.  I spent the rest of 2010 NED.  I had that feeling that something wasn't right, but I'll be honest I couldn't say what it was just that feeling.  I suffer with arthritis and other back issues so it was hard to know one pain from the other.  However, my onc wanted to appease me and ordered the x-ray, which let to the CT, which let to the MRI, which let to stage IV diagnosis.  I did a course of radiation on my spine for pain mgmt and started chemo.  I was on chemo until Dec 28th 2011 when the brain mets were discovered and just finished WBR.  I meet with the onc this week to discuss follow up scans and more chemo (I hope).  I then have a follow up visit with the rad onc the following week hoping the big tumor in the cerebrel part of the brain shrunk enough for the gamma knife or some sort of a targeted procedure.  I am not ready to give up, a little more time.

Shannon - the doctor relationship is very important.  Also, like the others said, ask questions, what type of breast cancer? What stage, What grade? Node involvelment? If so, how many? Surgery?  If so, what is he recommending and what about recon? Chemo? What kind of chemo? radiation?  Having your Aunt with you is very important, because you don't hear everything, your mind is racing and trying to absorb as much as possible.  Good luck and let us know how the appt went (((Hugs)))",

It's better to be safe and get the names of the medications being prescribed, the dosages and amounts given and then match that up to what is filled at the pharmacy.  Mistakes happen.",

Monday I start chemo and Tuesday I will have outpatient surgery to get the port.

Oh....and thanks for the info on the blueberry plant.  I'll let my DD know that her one plant is lonely and needs a friend in order to make blueberries.  ",

I normally host Thanksgiving each year and have decided I will do it again this year........... The first few years of hosting such a big event are learning years - My first time hosting Thanksgiving I was really worried because I had never cooked a turkey and had no idea what I was doing- my grandmother had always done it.  So.......... I listened to different people got ideas and made my first turkey.  It was wonderful! Tender, juicy and full of flavor.  Everyone raved over my turkey - I was so proud of myself.  Year two rolls around I knew I had it made............ I could make a turkey!!!  I was ready.  I woke up early to get the turkey ready, stuffed it and put it in the oven.  I was so organized I had everything ready, house decorated, cleaned and side dishes prepared.  Everyone started showing up with more yummy dishes - the wonderful aroma of Thanksgiving was everywhere, including the turkey.  It was time........ the turkey was ready to come out of the oven.  We took the turkey out of the oven, put it on the platter sliced into it......................and it was raw in the middle.  Apparently the damn turkey must have still been a little frozen in the middle, then I stuffed it and underestimated the cooking time.   Year 2 - we ate Thanksgiving without a turkey  - it went home as left overs.

It was so bad two nights ago I actually thought about the ER. I had a follow up with the surgeon that handled my achilles tear and he suggested and made an appt with a spine specialist, which is this week and I do have an appt with my primary this week too.  My DH, children, friends and family know that I have back pain, but I'm doing everything I can to hide it.  DH just thinks its the normal pain - he doesn't know how bad it is.  I know I should be able to talk to my DH, family or friends about my worries, but I can't.  I am more worried about their reactions to something I don't know yet.  I am just so tired of being the \"sick one\".  I don't want to be the patient.  But...........I am worried.  Why is the pain so bad?  What if?  I don't usually worry like this - I really don't and I never worry about the \"what if's\" in life and just wrote that in a letter to my DD who left home for her 1st year of college this weekend.  Worrying about the \"what if's\" is a waste of good energy, but here I am stuck in the \"what if's\" - this is new territory for me. I know that I should feel comfortable enough to talk to someone, but I don't.  I have always been the caregiver personality and am the caregiver for many people and the thought of worrying anyone after what they've gone through with me in the last year is just too much of a burden to give them right now.  I don't have answers - not yet.  This could simple be a more advanced stage of the type of arthritis (anklosing spondylosis) I have or I may have injured something more than I thought. So....I am writing this to my cyber friends so that I can get this off of my chest and know that all you can understand these crazy feelings.

Then this mysterious pain and inability to move her foot went to both feet - she was suddenly in a wheelchair - a month later it was in her hands and she was unable to even bathe or brush her own teeth.  Again...... doctors don't know what it is.  She pushes through - still attending school, her friends helping her with her work, teachers giving oral test instead of written.  She works hard in therapy and manages to get out of the wheelchair, but still struggles with pain. One year later she is diagnosed with a rare neurological disease that is treatable.  She hobbles through the next year trying different medications, learning to manage the disease, but is unable to cheer anymore, which disappoints her, but you do what you have to in life.  During this time, she continues to volunteer at the Lighthouse for the Blind, continues to do various other volunteer work with Key Club and maintains honor roll status.  Then......... the fall of last year her dad passes away and early summer I'm diagnosed with Stage III Breast Cancer. The start of her Senior year she has to deal with the death of a parent and the cancer diagnosis of another in addition to Senior year stress.  Does she give up?  Nope, she works just as hard with her volunteer work, helps more around the house and manages to get her grades up even higher!!!  And.............her hard work has started to pay off with scholarships she's being offered to various colleges, but that's not all............ She was nominated by her peers for Louisiana Young Heros Award - an award given literally to only handful of kids each year.  The committee interviewed her teachers and school administrators, talked to various other people she's worked with and she has WON the award.  My sweet angel will be one of a few select kids in the State to receive this award and will be honored with a luncheon at the Govenor's Mansion in April (by which time I hope to have more hair).  I am so proud of her............. She has overcome so much in the last few years and has ended up on top!!!!  Amazing what our kids can do when they put their minds to it.  I am so proud of her and just wanted to share it with my BC Sisters.

Something went terribly wrong!!!  As they were hooking me up, prepping my arm I turned my head sideways and closed my eyes going into relax mode.  They shot me with some numbing medication, which is when I opened my eyes and let them know I was in pain and still wide awake.  The nurse then tells the radiologist doing the procedure, I thought she was asleep, I gave her Versaid.  I said nope, I'm not asleep IT'S HURTING, they gave me the rest of the Fentenyl and by now I am hysterical and can feel EVERYTHING.  I can feel the coil going up the vein, hear the sounds, feel the tugging, etc.........I was hysterical, but the didn't stop.  They claimed to have even given me another vial of Fentenyl.    Something didn't work.  I was straight as an arrow by the time they rolled me into recovery.  So much so, I walked out 10 minutes later with my instructions in hand.   I woke up the next morning in so much pain, muscles spasms, stiffness and overall pain I went hysterical again.  And...........I was running 102 fever.  I took a double dose of pain meds, went into the hospital and had to have cultures done of the port area, blood work and blood cultures, plus my neupogen shot.  Holy Moly Guacamole...... I couldn't speak without crying I was in so much pain.  My youngest DD said it was the first time she'd ever seen me like that - I'd have to agree. From that point to my family kept me on a strict every 4 hour pain medication regime so that it wouldn't get out of control again (even in the wee hours of the morning).   Honestly, I think for whatever reason, I didn't get the drugs via IV, there must have been a blockage.  Then, I was in so much pain that my entire body tensed up so much while my arm was strapped to the table that a nerve was pinched in my neck and shoulder, of course terrible back spasms and because the pain was off the wall my nerves were pissed and everything hurt.    Slowly, I am feeling better, but I will never EVER go through that again if I can help it.  The hospital director will be getting a letter and maybe a phone call on this one, in addition to another problem I had.  I just can't believe a facility this big with so many accolades let me go through such a barbaric procedure. Can you imagine, having nothing for pain other than one freakin' local numbing shot while having a port inserted into your bicep while they thread the line to the main artery?????????  Horrible!!!!!!

I also quit eating anything that might cause heartburn a few hours before bedtime.  For me anyting with onions, peppers, tomatoes or tomato sauces, citrus, fruit, chocolate and I found that even sugar free kool-aid bothers me.

Today was nice.  Although I didn't feel loopy, I didn't want to drive because I'm sure my reflexes are not 100% when taking meds.  My mom picked me up @ 11:30am, we had a guilt free lunch of seafood gumbo and split a lunch platter of fish, shrimp and oysters - even splitting the food we couldn't finish it.  Then we went to the mall so that I could get my DH his Bday present for tomorrow.  I also treated myself to a watch I've been eyeing up for over a year and some DKNY-Pure body cream (my favorite new scent).  After shopping we stopped at a wonderful \"fancy\" bakery and had delicious deserts that I can't pronouce, then hung out with my sister for the rest of the afternoon and did a little shopping in her closets (which is fun, she has tons of stuff)............ending it with boiled crawfish from my favorite seafood place.  I had a wonderful day!  And.......the pain was minimal until I hit the 9 hour mark of my 12 hour medicine, it increased, but I made it through using my other meds.  I know the onc said it would take about two days or that he may need to increase the dose because he was giving me a low dose, but I do notice a difference in the pain already.  Last night there was a period of about an hour or so in which I felt absolutely no pain, nothing, nada......it was so nice!!!! ",

Disney truly is magical....................all of your troubles seem to disappear at the gate. ",

I now have a handicap permit and only use it when I'm having a bad day or a day I know I need to park close.  If I'm having a good day or even a bad day, but I know I can still park close without using a handicap spot I park elsewhere.  I worry that there will be someone else who needs the place more than I do, especially someone with a wheelchair, motorized chair, walker, crutches or an elderly person who needs more space and doesn't have the ability to walk very far without sitting or taking a break. Again, Kudos to you for standing up to the weasels that tried or did park in the handicap place.",

Something went terribly wrong!!!  As they were hooking me up, prepping my arm I turned my head sideways and closed my eyes going into relax mode.  They shot me with some numbing medication, which is when I opened my eyes and let them know I was in pain and still wide awake.  The nurse then tells the radiologist doing the procedure, I thought she was asleep, I gave her Versaid.  I said nope, I'm not asleep IT'S HURTING, they gave me the rest of the Fentenyl and by now I am hysterical and can feel EVERYTHING.  I can feel the coil going up the vein, hear the sounds, feel the tugging, etc.........I was hysterical, but the didn't stop.  They claimed to have even given me another vial of Fentenyl.    Something didn't work.  I was straight as an arrow by the time they rolled me into recovery.  So much so, I walked out 10 minutes later with my instructions in hand.   I woke up the next morning in so much pain, muscles spasms, stiffness and overall pain I went hysterical again.  And...........I was running 102 fever.  I took a double dose of pain meds, went into the hospital and had to have cultures done of the port area, blood work and blood cultures, plus my neupogen shot.  Holy Moly Guacamole...... I couldn't speak without crying I was in so much pain.  My youngest DD said it was the first time she'd ever seen me like that - I'd have to agree. From that point to my family kept me on a strict every 4 hour pain medication regime so that it wouldn't get out of control again (even in the wee hours of the morning).   Honestly, I think for whatever reason, I didn't get the drugs via IV, there must have been a blockage.  Then, I was in so much pain that my entire body tensed up so much while my arm was strapped to the table that a nerve was pinched in my neck and shoulder, of course terrible back spasms and because the pain was off the wall my nerves were pissed and everything hurt.    Slowly, I am feeling better, but I will never EVER go through that again if I can help it.  The hospital director will be getting a letter and maybe a phone call on this one, in addition to another problem I had.  I just can't believe a facility this big with so many accolades let me go through such a barbaric procedure. Can you imagine, having nothing for pain other than one freakin' local numbing shot while having a port inserted into your bicep while they thread the line to the main artery?????????  Horrible!!!!!!

I was also able to get out for fun getting a mani-pedi, meet friends for lunch, and get errands done.  I'm sure I over did because I felt good and didn't want to pass on feeling well. I woke up Saturday not feeling bad, but not feeling good anymore.  I pretty much slept off and on all day watching television, other than cooking a dish to bring to my cousins for Easter. I woke up Sunday feeling the same way as the day before, but emotionally happier because it was Easter. I took it easy until it was time to leave. The we jumped in the car and took the hour drive to her house. That was when I started to feel bad. DH thinks because of the brain mets and some swelling (possibly) that I developed slight motion sickness. Anyway, after celebrating Easter and another hour drive home I wasn't feeling well at all.  Typically when I feel bad my emotions take over. I guess DH suspected something was wrong because when I announced I was going to bed and left the room, he followed me to the room to find out if I was okay and that was it, I couldn't hold it in anymore. The tears just started flowing and wouldn't stop. I told him I was just tired, not just physically, but tired.  Tired of people not realizing I am sick. Other than bloat face/body, which is ugly and I hate.  I still function so I know it's hard, but seriously don't people get it? Cancer doesn't mean curling up in bed and waiting to die anymore.  I'm tired of no longer be able to run errands when I want to run an errand, tired of not being able to jump up from a seating position without walking off.  I have to take my time AND use a da#n walker or wheelchair.  This time I'm tired of NO HAIR.  I just tired of it, but I'm stil in for the fight and won't give up, I'm just TIRED of it. Then as I sat there crying, snot nosed and feeling sorry for myself I remembered I have drugs for these times.  I took a Xanax, stopped crying and just talked to my DH about \"stuff\".  The Xanax kicked in and I started to feel better.  Don't know why I'm sharing this, but I am.  Does this happen to you from time to time? How do you handle?  Do you get angry, sad or both? Jenn Jenn - June 2009 IDC-TN, Stage III, 02/2011 Stage IV mets to the lungs & spine / Laugh until your belly hurts, then laugh some more...........

Then this mysterious pain and inability to move her foot went to both feet - she was suddenly in a wheelchair - a month later it was in her hands and she was unable to even bathe or brush her own teeth.  Again...... doctors don't know what it is.  She pushes through - still attending school, her friends helping her with her work, teachers giving oral test instead of written.  She works hard in therapy and manages to get out of the wheelchair, but still struggles with pain. One year later she is diagnosed with a rare neurological disease that is treatable.  She hobbles through the next year trying different medications, learning to manage the disease, but is unable to cheer anymore, which disappoints her, but you do what you have to in life.  During this time, she continues to volunteer at the Lighthouse for the Blind, continues to do various other volunteer work with Key Club and maintains honor roll status.  Then......... the fall of last year her dad passes away and early summer I'm diagnosed with Stage III Breast Cancer. The start of her Senior year she has to deal with the death of a parent and the cancer diagnosis of another in addition to Senior year stress.  Does she give up?  Nope, she works just as hard with her volunteer work, helps more around the house and manages to get her grades up even higher!!!  And.............her hard work has started to pay off with scholarships she's being offered to various colleges, but that's not all............ She was nominated by her peers for Louisiana Young Heros Award - an award given literally to only handful of kids each year.  The committee interviewed her teachers and school administrators, talked to various other people she's worked with and she has WON the award.  My sweet angel will be one of a few select kids in the State to receive this award and will be honored with a luncheon at the Govenor's Mansion in April (by which time I hope to have more hair).  I am so proud of her............. She has overcome so much in the last few years and has ended up on top!!!!  Amazing what our kids can do when they put their minds to it.  I am so proud of her and just wanted to share it with my BC Sisters.

I was also able to get out for fun getting a mani-pedi, meet friends for lunch, and get errands done.  I'm sure I over did because I felt good and didn't want to pass on feeling well. I woke up Saturday not feeling bad, but not feeling good anymore.  I pretty much slept off and on all day watching television, other than cooking a dish to bring to my cousins for Easter. I woke up Sunday feeling the same way as the day before, but emotionally happier because it was Easter. I took it easy until it was time to leave. The we jumped in the car and took the hour drive to her house. That was when I started to feel bad. DH thinks because of the brain mets and some swelling (possibly) that I developed slight motion sickness. Anyway, after celebrating Easter and another hour drive home I wasn't feeling well at all.  Typically when I feel bad my emotions take over. I guess DH suspected something was wrong because when I announced I was going to bed and left the room, he followed me to the room to find out if I was okay and that was it, I couldn't hold it in anymore. The tears just started flowing and wouldn't stop. I told him I was just tired, not just physically, but tired.  Tired of people not realizing I am sick. Other than bloat face/body, which is ugly and I hate.  I still function so I know it's hard, but seriously don't people get it? Cancer doesn't mean curling up in bed and waiting to die anymore.  I'm tired of no longer be able to run errands when I want to run an errand, tired of not being able to jump up from a seating position without walking off.  I have to take my time AND use a da#n walker or wheelchair.  This time I'm tired of NO HAIR.  I just tired of it, but I'm stil in for the fight and won't give up, I'm just TIRED of it. Then as I sat there crying, snot nosed and feeling sorry for myself I remembered I have drugs for these times.  I took a Xanax, stopped crying and just talked to my DH about \"stuff\".  The Xanax kicked in and I started to feel better.  Don't know why I'm sharing this, but I am.  Does this happen to you from time to time? How do you handle?  Do you get angry, sad or both? Jenn Jenn - June 2009 IDC-TN, Stage III, 02/2011 Stage IV mets to the lungs & spine / Laugh until your belly hurts, then laugh some more...........

Some of what was said stuck because I remember waking up the next day and hitting the internet with what I remembered and the pathology reports from the biopsies.  After the biopsies I was told they thought it was stage 2, but they wouldn't be able to give me the offical stage until after surgery.  In may case it did move to stage 3.  The official staging comes with the surgery once they can determine the true size of the tumor, node involvement and so on.     Love the hair idea, I should have thought of that.  I also have to comment on the udder/cow thing you mentioned on the mammo biopsies.  My co-worker mooed at me when I left the office to have my mammo biopsies and said \"enjoy\".  The whole time I was laying there with my boob hanging out under the table all I could think of was her mooing at me.  LOL............

Chronic pain is so hard for our friends and family to understand and if someone hasn't suffered with it they really don't understand it. I think doctors also don't know what to do and are so afraid to over prescribe and/or turn patients into addicts that they don't work with the patient in the way that they should.  (((HUGS))) to all of you and my heart goes out to each and everyone of you that is suffering.
