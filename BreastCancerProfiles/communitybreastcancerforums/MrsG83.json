Dr said most likely Fibroadenoma but due to lobulation, size and palpable nature, a biopsy should be done. Had US guided core biopsy on 26th. Dr said results should only take 1-2 days. Thursday and Friday, i stared at my phone all day, even bringing it into bathroom when I showered. On Monday, they called me to say the report was \u201cstuck in pathology\u201d. They told me they\u2019d be on top of it and get back to me. Well that day came and went and still nothing. Of course they are closed today. I haven\u2019t spoken to a Dr yet. Is my report lost? Do I have some sort of crazy issue they\u2019ve never seen before I feel so powerless and nervous. Log in to post a reply",
