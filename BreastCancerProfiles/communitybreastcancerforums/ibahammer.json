My insurance company required results from the mammogram, diagnostic ultrasound and core biopsy before they would okay the MRI.  Hopefully you won't have to go through all of that before you can get a MRI. The MRI is far more accurate than a mammogram or a diagnostic ultrasound but its also more expensive so my insurance company wasn't really cooperative in the beginning.  Since you have implants maybe they will allow you to bypass some of the steps that were required of me.  Again, wishing you the best!",

Some of the compression garments for truncal lymphedema are seriously expensive.  I also haven't found one that fits me well so in the meantime I have been using under armor.  Again, not a perfect solution but better than nothing when I am experiencing truncal lymphedema.  Good luck with your fact finding; I think the information will be relevent to a lot of us!",
