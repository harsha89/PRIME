DF seems like the obvious choice for surgery and treatment due to reputation, but I am struggling with this decision. Really liked the team at Elliot, but just not sure liking them is enough to overcome DF\u2019s excellent reputation. Both gave essentially same diagnosis and recommendations for surgery (lumpectomy and lymph node dissection). Boston is not terribly inconvenient but but not as convenient as Manchester. I know it\u2019s its largely a personal decision but I\u2019m having a difficult time deciding where to proceed. I have MRIs scheduled at both hospitals next week, so I need to figure this out.
