Was anyone able to pick what time of day they could have appointments? I run a home daycare and I am hoping to be able to have some sort of schedule with these appointments. I would like to be able to do them later in the afternoon or evening. Any help would be appreciated. Dx 8/25/2008, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/5 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I was pretty pleased with how everything looked until the scar tissue started to form. My tumor was at the bottom of my breast (right where the underwire of a bra would sit). I formed a really hard spot of scar tissue there. Now, when I stretch my arm everything in that area pulls. To top it off, I have a vein right there and it pulls the vein to the point where it sticks right out of my chest. It is most uncomfortable. I have been doing some massage to the scar and it is minimally helping. I have also been applying cocoa butter with vitamin E. Is there anything else I can do to help this situation. The nice hard lump of scar tissue is really not attractive at all. I think this all sucks......cancer sucks bigtime :( Dx 8/25/2008, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/5 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
