My surgeon is one of the best around, but he has a bit of an ego.Â  I wanted a second opinion, but I didn't feel I had to mention it to him. I just had the radiology center put my records, scans,etc. on a disk and I took it to another surgeon. Your records belong to you. You paid for all of those tests, and you can have results sent or hand carry them you have anywhere you like. Just ask for copies. As for when to see an oncologist, sometimes it is recommended that you do chemo (if necessary) before surgery. There are various reasons why this might be a good idea. Most importantly, you can tell if a particular chemo is actually working. If not, they can try a different one. If you have chemo after surgery, you really can't be sure they got it right. Hope this helps!",

You will feel better once you have been \"staged\" and have a plan of attack in place. You asked how bad DCIS has to be before it becomes invasive. DCIS is a cancer that has not yet grown large enough to break out of its duct or \"invade\". How quickly this happens depends upon the proliferation rate of the cancer (how fast the cells are dividing). Tumors are graded on a scale of 1-3. Grade 1 is slow-growing. Grade 3 is aggressive. This piece of info should be on your pathology report. As for what to expect, your treatment will depend upon a lot of different factors: primarily the tumor's stage, grade, and hormone receptor status. Generally speaking, BC tumors are removed surgically (either by mastectomy or lumpectomy). This may or may not be followed up with chemotherapy and/or radiation. I'm guessing that the other surgery you mentioned is a sentinel node biopsy. They will check to see if the cancer has spread to the nodes nearest your tumor. The theory is if it hasn't reached them, it probably hasn't spread beyond them. Your node status is an important part of the staging process. You will probably have all kinds of tests and scans. I found that scary and more than a little surreal, but not painful. Afterwards, I appreciated my oncologist's thoroughness. It gave me confidence in his recommendations. Speaking of oncologists, do you have one yet? It may be a good idea to see one prior to your bigger surgery. See also the \"When to get an oncologist?\" thread on this forum. I hope you find this helpful. It sounds like you are a fighter and are surrounded by wonderful friends and family. If you need us, we are all here for you, too.",

I was so prepared for a benign result that at first I actually did not understand when he said it was cancer. He had to take my hands, look me in the eye and repeat, \"Yes, it IS cancer.\" I was so very naive- I know, but given my lack of preparedness for the bad news, I am glad I heard it in person. I suddenly had a million questions and he took the time to answer them all and then hooked me up with a fantastic oncologist. For me personally, it was the best way to handle it. I really don't resent him making me wait a couple of days. I'm sure if I had called, they would have told me sooner.",

He did both a core and a fine needle biopsy right there in the office. He is the former chief of surgery at a major hospital and he doesn't mess around. I was numbed first so it didn't hurt. I felt fine afterwards and even went to the mall a little while later. That was not really a good idea. My incision started bleeding and it was kind of embarrassing. I was pretty clueless and very much in denial at the time. I was only slightly sore the next day. Hope this helps. Best to you on Thursday.",
