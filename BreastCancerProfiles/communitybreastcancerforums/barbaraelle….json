I don't know when I have ever found a more enthusiastic welcome!  As if we all just found out we are in the same sorority...............which we are.  We would all rather be in a different group, but this is indeed a real sorority, because we all care for and support and learn from each other.  I know just how you feel because I floundered around for years, unable to find a soul who even heard of RIBP, let alone anyone who actually had it.  And then, when I fell into this with the help of our Binney, I felt like I fell into a gold mine. It took me a long time to be properly diagnosed too, because so few people have ever heard of it. They had me chasing all over the country for a couple of years, all the while my arm was getting weaker and weaker.  i heard every crazy thing from carpel tunnel, which seems to be a first shot favorite, to not-so-subtle hints that the whole thing had a psychological cause.  I like your guy, who said it doesn't happen any more.  Wow!  Like bubonic plague?  I never heard that one. When did your arm start to hang down 2 inches?  From the very beginning or slowly?  I always have a tough time deciding on a date for my RIBP, because it was so very subtle.  I think I will finally settle on 2000, because that was when I realized my handwriting was getting sloppy.  My hand and arm seemed to be working nicely, and although I mentioned to my onc, neither of us thought it was very important.  But by 2004, I could not cut through a bagel or butter it.  Now I have almost no movement at all and my right arm hangs down.  I am unable to bend my elbow, of course, and the fingers have no grasp.  My shoulder seems to be tilting, but I cannot say I have a 2inch subluxation.  My onc never suggested a sling, and I don't think I could keep my elbow in that position.  Sitting down, maybe; but I am pretty sure gravity would make it very uncomfortable if I stood up.  How do you get in and out of a jacket by yourself? I am very into managing by myself, so I want to ask if you have figured out any surefire way of getting toothpaste on your toothbrush without having the brush fall over.  I think it will take a vise of some sort.  Do you have any survivor tricks you would like to share?   I am glad you found us, Connie, but sorry you had to.  Keep us informed about that nerve transplant thing (?) and take care.

My RIBP showed up about 25 years later.  I used to think it didn't happen until years later, but looking back I realized it was much earlier; I just didn't know what it was.  It sounds like yours was a much more sudden onset than mine.  My handwriting became sloppy, then I had trouble holding things, then I started dropping things, etc, etc..........you know the story.  It took years to get a diagnosis, just like you, and not from my radiation oncologist, but from a neurologist.  I was so incredulous that I made him spell it out for me. I didn't have the upper mantle radiation like you did, but I had radiation seeds implanted in my breast for 24 or 48 hours, I really don't remember which, but I was in isolation all that time, and any doctor or nurse who came in was wearing a really spaceman-looking outfit, helmet and all, from top to bottom.  I was actually radioactive during that time.  That added another 5,000 rad to the 10,000 I already had from weeks of radiation therapy.  It was considered a \"for good measure\" treatment.  It is cold comfort to know that they don't do that anymore. I agree with you completely that this 2% number is ridiculous.  I think it is way underreported by the docs themselves, and nobody is counting all the women who have just curled up on their couches and resigned themselves to no having no life at all.  Like you, I have no idea how to find any statistics, and the only women I know who suffer from RIBP are right here.  The quality of life.  Something your onc doesn't mention and it never occurs to anyone to ask about.  First let's blast out the cancer any which way we can.  Then we can discuss quality of life..........if you bring it up  However, we must give credit to the guys who struggled against their own peers to make lumpectomy respectable and safe, instead of giving every woman a radical mastectomy whether she needed it or not.  What we need is another group of dedicated researchers who want to reduce the terrible side effects of chemo and radiation, who have the quality of a woman's life as a primary, yet still safe objective. Never worry about whether you will be judged on this panel.  If you can't whine or complain here, where can you?  To one extent or the other, we are all in the same boat here, and we each bring something important to each other.      Did I understand that you are still working?  I admire your gumption and determination, and whatever it is that you do, it must involve a lot of brain power, which seems to be in fine working order. I share many symptoms with you, shifting every thing you do to the hand that is not too happy about its new responsibilities, watching your right arm grow weaker, etc.  I do not share your unfortunate allergy to all pain pills and narcotics.  I hope there is someone reading this now who has a suggestion for you. You are in a good place here, keep posting. Barbara-",

I dfon't know if anyone's bad hand/arm is as useless as mine.  Therapists tell me to use it as an \"paper weight\" when I haqve to hold one end of something tightly, but even though it feels like a tree limb hanging down, it slides right off anything I try to lay it on.  Anybody have any suggestions for dealing with it in a public washroom? It hasn't been easy for me to shop for clothing, particularly overhead tops for several years now, but lately it has become just about impossible.  I have to take my husband with me, of course, and I am grateful to have him.  But getting permission to take him in the changing room with me is another story.  So I often take home 2 sizes of something and wind up taking one or both of them back.  At home by myself, I have to sit on the floor to get my arm into a sleeve.  Anybody have any suggestions for this either? I am always interested in any new developments in lymphedema, but most of it does not apply to me, except that interesting velcro sleeve you can put on by yourself, Binney.  Thank you for showing it; anything that will make me feel more independent is a good thing.  I just wish there was half as much helpful information about RIBP. Ronimom, I love that you can jump around in an arobics class!  I did not like a sling that puts pressure on the shoulder, but you should try it.  You may be able to tolerate it better than I. Oh, and anybody who can tell me the best way of getting out of a narrow bathtub with one hand, and a grab bar, let me know.  I always disliked showers, and now I am really afraid of falling in one...how can you handle the soap?...

I also have RIBP, starting 25 or so years after lumpectomy, but not properly diagnosed for more than 30 years.  I had no idea what it was and started getting all kinds of therapy for weakness, muscle fatigue, and that old favorite, carpel tunnel.  Then came the LE, starting as a small lump in the affected forearm, which also didn't get diagnosed quickly.  Therapist was not helpful, continued having me squeeze balls. To shorten this, the BP actually caused the LE, which I have pretty much under control.  The BP, however, is ongoing.  It started as yours, with tingling, etc, until I could no longer close my hand.  Nor can I bend my elbow.  And it is creeping up my upper arm, on its way to my shoulder.  I can still shrug, but not as high as my other shoulder.  I have no idea where this is going and no one seems to be able (or willing) to tell me. I'd like to know what exercises you are doing to keep what you have.  I'll try anything (except squeezing balls). Thanks for sharing, Barbara- ",

What I can tell you is that the paralysis renders my arm, from the fingers to somewhere in the upper arm, numb and useless,  But I can shrug my shoulder.  My elbow cannot bend unless I bend it with my other hand. My wrist is immobile. There are many things I can no longer do, like signing my name or shaking hands, but the most upsetting one for me, the one problem I cannot solve, is getting my bra on.  Now, if you are fortunate enough to be small-breasted, you may be able to get away with no bra, in certain fabrics, of course.  My right breast, thanks to the radiation, is the size and shape of a naval orange, right under my chin, almost, and my left breast most resembles the size and shape of an old football that could use some air.  There is no way I can go anywhere without my bra.  My husband and I indulge ourselves in a little black humor now and then, that if something happened to him, I wouldn't be able to go to the funeral unless somebody got me into my bra first. However, I have learned a few things that make life a little less complicated.  I wear pants with no zippers, just pull-ups,  Shoes with no laces.  Socks I can handle, but panty-hose is just a memory.  Cardigan style tops with buttons, no overheads.  Clip-on earrings only, and overhead necklaces.  Jackets with buttons, no zippers.  Cooking is cut way, way back (which is not all bad) but be careful not to buy things you can't open with one hand.  Eat out, order in.  Use liquid soap with a washcloth, not bar.  There are lots of tricks, some of which I am sure you know already, but the most important thing is not to beat yourself up over anything,   Let me know if there is anything specific you want to know, perhaps I can help. I wish you luck with your upcoming treatment, and if you go to Boston, you will be in one of the medical places in the world. Hang in there, and stay in touch, Barbara-                  ",

I HAVE TO BUY LONG-SLEEVED TOPS TOO, BUT I CANNOT SHOP ALONE.  I HAVE TO DRAG MY HUSBAND WITH ME, SO I CANNOT DO IT AS OFTEN AS I WOULD LIKE.  I ALWAYS HATED SHOPPING ANYWAY, SO LIKE YOU, I AM NOT FINDING MUCH.  SO MANY THINGS WE CAN NO LONGER WEAR.  (YOU NOTICE I AM DELIBERATELY NOT MENTIONING ADVANCED AGE AS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR?)

one little hint before i rest my 5 good fingers and you rest your eyes; black and decker puts out a jar opener that really works.  it's big, but it's worth it, i think.  you only need one hand to work it.  i don't remember exactly what they call it, but it's around $50, and worth every penny. hang in there, erica, and keep talking!

My RIBP is still advancing, slowly but inexoribly, and is starting to affect my shoulder.  I feel slanted sometimes when I am walking and still quite unbalanced.  I am always afraid of falling. I did try trental and vitamin E for about a year a long time ago, when I still had some use of my hand, but for me it did nothing. I had a lot of numbness and tingling then, and now I just feel nothing but weight.  Sometimes, however, I do get a moment or two of an electric shock sensation in my fingers, but that is all I feel.  The lymphedema is behaving itself, still light to middling, and I don't use a glove during the day.  I still hate wearing only long sleeves, but the RIBP has deformed my hand and arm so much.......my hand bends backward too and the arm cannot move at the elbow......that I wouldn't wear short sleeves anyway.  There is more, but not today.  On our way to see Capital Steps and dinner with friends.  That should perk me up for at least 8 hours.

It is interesting that you say you were in a state of mourning.  That is a very apt description, a way to try to explain to others who do not have this.  Almost everyone can identify with a state of mourning for a lost loved one.  It is exactly the same, if not worse, as losing (the use of) a part of your body.  You are entitled to mourn until you are good and ready to resume your new life without it. In the meantime, enjoy the summer flowers and eat some ice cream.  Stay in touch. Barbara-",

I hear your frustration with the whole system.  My doctor, the radiation onc, says that I am only one of 2 patients he has seen in 30 years with RIBP.  Even he refers to it as \"this condition.\"  He thinks that science has to come up with a way of figuring out who is more susceptical to radiation, and that we should not all get the same cookie cutter treatment, as you said.  But for now, it's all we have.  He is very sympathetic, at least, and he doesn't say I should just be grateful to be alive.  We are still on the cutting edge of radiation therapy.  There is so much about it that is still unknown.  We were just born too soon. I know how much you want facts.  I am like that too.  That's how I found out about lumpectomies 30 years ago.  No one in the midwest was doing them.  Only Boston, Houston, Yale, and somewhere in California.  Boston was the closest.  I was so pleased with my discovery, and despite much grumbling and head-shaking from just about everyone, I went ahead.  At that time I asked if there was any down side to radiation therapy, and I was assured, no.   So when my upper chest became disfigured within a year, I sank into a real depression.  I felt very betrayed.  Since no one I knew had had radiation, I felt very isolated.  I figured out that it must be my fault for having made the wrong decision.  Somehow, we always manage to blame ourselves when bad things beyond our control happen. Your decisions were based on the best information available to you.  If you had been informed of the chances of averse reactions, you would probably have taken that \"only 2%\" chance.  I don't think medicine is holding out on us; I think most docs are not as honest as they could be about how many patients have poor reactions to what they believe will help you.  They hate to admit failure.  The best ones at least admit they just don't know.  So they help us to blame ourselves too, because we should have picked a different doctor and a different treatment.    It's really not anybody's fault.  I wish it was.  Then we would have someone to hate besides ourselves.  It is just a bad hand, a raw deal, an unfair break.  I am not minimizing your reasons for your anger.  I just hope to help you a little bit on this one day.

Binney, (see?) I am having a hard time trying to figure out questions for the interviewers to use.  I can present the problems, but at the end of the problems, questions can be asked, like, couldn't the continuing immobility of the arm cause the le?  could it happen the other way around? what exercises, if any, are there for those of us who have both conditions? And we could ask what will it take to make the entire medical profession, starting with the schools, finally wake up and teach doctors, nurses, therapists, surgeons, and especially radiation oncologists that every patient who has had surgery and/or radiation therapy is at risk for both conditions for the rest of her life?  what will it take to make the doctors aware of the beginning symptoms and think of these side effects before they have exhausted every other possibility, all the way down to hypocondria first, wasting valuable time and money, and perhaps missing a golden opportunity to stop the damage before it becomes too late? These kinds of questions can only be asked after the facts have been stated, which is quite possible in declarative sentences, not as questions.  Is this making any sense to anybody but me?  I am open to all any suggestions.  (You know, that \"I\" is VERY difficult on that side. but I will keep trying.  Be patient.)

It doesn't hurt to massage the fingers, and I found it very easy to do by intertwining the fingers of your good   hand with the fingers of the other hand, and running them up and down the sides of the affected fingers.  At the very least, it keeps them from swelling up and they look almost normal that way.  I would exercise that thumb  and    keep it as loose as you can for as long as you can.  Maybe it will keep its function.

I am so sorry that you and Connie have so much pain.  I have been lucky there, so far.  Once in a while I do get the kind of sharp pain you describe, but it has never lasted more than a few seconds.  I do prefer to sit with my arm in my lap too; it takes the pressure off the arm and shoulder.  (Do you ever wonder what that heavy thing is in your lap, and you look down and see that it's your own arm!?)  I do not wear a sling, but I think I will ask my therapist if he thinks it would help enough to use it.  I would also worry about back pain; I manage to get enough of that on my own.  About the finger massage I mentioned yeserday, I forgot to add that sometimes it is much easier to lay the bad hand on your knee and then lay the good hand over it, and slowly get the good fingers in between the bad ones and pull up, very gently.  Do NOT pull down!  Just detatch the good fingers and start again.  It becomes almost automatic if you are sitting and watching TV.  There should be a noticeable difference in the size of the fingers, but maybe you should stroke up to the hand as well if you think it is swelling.  Sort of the really short version of your lymph drainage massage.

Nice going, Doc.  I bet he never heard of it, or if he did, he'll swear it wasn't anything he did to cause it.  It must have been your own defective immune system.  I've heard them all. My RIBP took 25 years to show up, but it was a very slow process.  I understand the numbness and the tingling all too well, but the swelling you mention is something that concerns me, and it might be lymphedema.  The sooner you get that checked out, the better.  Do you have a physical therapist?  Do you like her?  Does she seem to have a brain or does she shrug?  You may need to see a physiatrist for a definite diagnosis.  They usually deal with sports related injuries, but they should be able to handle that for you. I am sorry that the entire breast cancer thing was such a terrible experience.  I mean, none of us had a good time with it, but I can tell that you are still very angry.  Don't fight that.  You sound strong and spunky to me, so go kick some cans or throw some stuff (you don't care about) around, and yell (in an empty house).  It's a stopgap measure but it helps.  Cancer doesn't have to interfere with your life.  You just have to rein it in, get a good grip on it, and make it trail way behind you, way behind all those other things that are important to you and that make you happy.  Just try to be a little patient with yourself.....yourself will thank you.  You have been through a lot, and we are all here to help you.  Zing us a post any time.  We will all be pulling for you.
