I didn't know in your twenties you can still be developing. I did tell the breast surgeon and she didn't really say much about if there's any relation with the abortion. I just worry so much because of the one becoming bigger and irritated everyday and sometimes it hurts. When I ask people around me if they ever had this issue they all give me this look of terror and say you better get that looked at. Also my back on that side began hurting a few months later weather it's related to that I'm not sure...it could be my office chair at work and I had severe arm pain on and off for about a year prior to this they think is a pinched nerve. I asked several doctors if that could affect that breast since it's on that side but they didn't seem to think so but my obgyn said it might.",

The thought of IBC makes me sick to my stomache. I just want this horrible feeling to go away so I can live my life and not be worried 24/7. I don't know about IBC but I have done some research on it and it's a scary thing. Do you know of anything that may cause one breast to get bigger/swell? Every time I look it up IBC is all that ever comes up :(",

I noticed about 5 months ago my right breast hurt and felt a little itchy one night and the next day I saw my dr who said it was nothing and did an exam with his hands. Then I noticed that breast now is like a half cup size bigger, and feels heavy to me I went back to that dr multiple times and he gave me a chest x ray and nothing showed then I had an ultra sound.....negative then a mammogram and another ultrasound at the Cleveland clinic and also came up negative I even had a visit with a breast Surgeon. She said she can't see anything she would be worried about. Yet it's still uncomfortable and when I wear my bra it feels the worst not really painful just uncomfortable. No other symptoms but I'm so worried and everyone thinks I'm crazy. I research this everyday and all that comes up with IBC and it makes me cry. The breast surgeon swears it's not that but I still don't have answers. As bad as it is I had an abortion in February I don't think that could affect one breast but I'm not sure please I would really love someone's input. Thank you and God bless Log in to post a reply",

I really appreciate both of your comments. I'm sorry to hear you (kicks) had to deal with ibc I hope your doing great now.",
