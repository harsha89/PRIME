It is my understanding that the current thinking is that estrogen positive cancers are less 'susceptible' to chemo, and that lobular  is also less likely to respond to chemo. My guess is this is not a recurrence, but that the lobular was there already when you were dx with the ductal.  So glad you got the MRI - once they do the surgery and check the nodes, have at least a second opinion about the efficacy of chemo.  I would do it again, even knowing it may not have 'helped' - I wanted all the odds in my favor - thinking good thoughts for you.  Leigh",

In the shower this morning, I used shampoo (which I've always used in the shower to shave my legs) and went faster, and did fine. You have to sort of get the feel for it, and I think it helps to go in stages (short cut, buzz, and then shave).

I started radiation Monday; nothing much to report so far except the weirdness of having this new daily routine. JP drops me at Gtown around 8:15; I sign in and get called for treatment by around 8:35; it takes 20-25 minutes (7 fields, 2 left 3 right) and then I take the Gtown shuttle to a corner about 2 blocks from our offices. I stop at Starbucks, walk to the office, and am here around 9:30. Maybe it's that I'm not a routines kind of person, but it feels completely weird that I will do this every weekday for 6 weeks and 4 days. On the hair front, nothing much to report - have this fuzzy stuff, sort of gray, maybe a hint of 'real' hair coming in a couple of spots, at the almost 5 week mark. Feeling well otherwise. I have sleep problems too, and use Tylenol PM but try to keep it to every other night or less. Hoping my body will settle into a better pattern at some point. Leigh",

My husband is 50 this year too, so we are planning a mid-point party, which will be after tx and maybe after I have hair again. Mine is still growing (stubble!) in spots after 2 TAC's, assume it will eventually give up the ghost. Leg hair basically gone, ditto under the arms, eyebrows and lashes hanging in, pubic hair a mixed story, though definitely not growing. I find the wig a necessary evil, for work only - I take it off in the parking garage! - but I get these gushing compliments from people who haven't seen me in a while. It gives me a laugh, usually after they've departed...scarves and hats are fine, I prefer 'just me' at home and in the immediate surroundings.

Got to a nice milestone with my oncologist on Friday - I'll see her every 6 months in alternation with the breast surgeon every six months.   So, it's still a doctor visit every 3 months, but only ONE.  I see the radiation onc annually now...small victories. Started Femara after about 9 months on Tamoxifen, as it was clear that the menopause that started when I started TAC is permanent.  A little hand and foot achiness in the a.m. but otherwise no SE's. I still come here pretty often; it helps me to keep my perspective.  I don't feel all that capable of helping folks - once in a while I see a post I can answer from my own experience - but I've forgotton a lot.  Another kind of victory, I guess. Anyway - thinking fondly of all my TAC sisters as I approach 2 years since dx (December 30).  Leigh",

I'll have breast surgeon, oncologist and MRI appointments in August.  Last mammo was in April and all was well, though I'm always mindful that mammo didn't find the ILC. We have renovated our Florida apartment (after buying the one next door to our original one, in a fit of insanity); the first one is empty because the rental market is nearly as bad as the market for selling.  We are not there much; we managed to get the boat to the Bahamas but are still working in DC, so now have brought her back to the Chesapeake again.  We are renting in Annapolis now, which is nice for sailing but a pain for commuting. Think of all of you and would love news.   Leigh",

Still on Femara - 8 years in April after ~6 months of Tamoxifen to be sure my chemo induced instant menopause would stick - and she says another 18 months max. Life is really good. Back to work after the late 2010 sabbatical and enjoying it (mostly) but thinking I might (sort of) retire again in late 2016 after the husband unit and I turn 60 that year. For shaz101, I'm an ILC'er but also chose lumpectomy and axillary nodedissection (6/16) and despite the need for regular mammography I've been very satisfied. And other than the fact that I can ALMOST taste the chemo cocktail when someone even mentions Zofran, the whole thing is a very very dim memory now. Sending many good thoughts. ",

Don't know what was up with that - just don't want you to worry that it's going to be worse and worse. It wasn't for me. I had very little nausea but what I did have was in 3 and 4. Thinking good thoughts. Leigh",

I started 23 March 2006 and finished with 6 treatments (every 3 weeks) in July 2006.  Lost my hair just before the second treatment.  Wore a wig to work only; stopped wearing it all together about 6 weeks after chemo ended, while doing radiation.  Had a LITTLE hair by the 12th of October (I know because my husband and I celebrated our \"100th\" birthday that day), enough by Christmas that I just looked like I had a very, very short cut.  My eyebrows took a long, long time to come back, and now they are still much more sparse than they were before. I was pretty lucky with side effects.  Had the treatment on Thursday, Neulasta on Friday, spent a \"lost\" weekend feeling lousy, and then climbed back to feeling well enough to travel (Florida to DC) for work by Tuesday.  Did that each of the 6 times. I'm doing well, feeling well.  Now have Mammogram once a year alternating with MRI once a year (I had ILC with 6/16 positive nodes, found by the initial MRI), see my breast surgeon once a year, and see my oncologist about 3 times a year (I'm on Femara as chemo put me into permanent menopause - I turned 50 in 2006), Thinking good thoughts for you all.  Leigh",

FYI, since you mention all the treatment elements you are facing: Though I did not have a mastectomy (my bc was bilateral, one IDC, one more serious ILC, but my breast surgeon was able to offer lumpectomies in both breasts), I did have \"the full monty\" chemo (TACX6, every third week from March to July) and 33 (also bilateral) radiation treatments, and I worked (and traveled to do it, during chemo) throughout once I got through the surgeries and recovery, so even treatment may allow you some semblance of \"normal\" life.  Don't know your menopause status; I was 49 and a few months at dx, and still having periods every month.  First chemo, last period, ever!  Took Tamoxifen for 5 or 6 months after radiation ended, then switched to Femara (only for women who are in menopause) - minimal side effects. Come back often.  Thinking good thoughts for you.  Leigh ",
