I also learned of Katherine Russell Rich on this site, who lived 19 years with Stage IV. If you haven't read her book, I recommend it. It is so funny, and it made me feel like a lot of things I feel are normal. It's called The Red Devil: To Hell and Back with Cancer. Take care all of you and keep trucking right along. Liz",

I'm kind of shocked about my tumor marker because my labs weren't dramatically improved except the ALP. Where are your mets? I'm also curious about your experience on Xeloda. I didn't like it. Also my oncologist said he would try me on Gemzar next. How tolerable is that? Thanks for any advice you can give. Liz",

My oncologist actually stopped my decadron today prior to the infusion to see if this will resolve the blood sugar issue. I also had problems with Afinitor raising my blood sugar and there were no steroids involved with that. Also, my heart rate is high too, and sometimes irregular. Hope this helps.

I've had 6 infusions so far, getting the 7th on the 11th (my first infusion was June 5th). I, too, lost most of my hair after about 2 weeks. It was so thin that I ended up shaving the rest off because I got tired of the mess on my pillow, in the shower, at work, etc. I have not had neutropenia or other low counts and am concerned that it isn't working well. Having said that, I feel the best I had in several months and my bone pain disappeared and my ALP lab went back to normal for the first time in a while. My tumor marker has been essentially stable for the time I've been on Halaven. I was getting pre-medicated with Decadron, but stopped that because my blood sugar went too high after every infusion (I'm not diabetic normally). I still take the Zofran for nausea. I'm curious if anyone out there has had a complete response/became NED on Halaven. I've never been NED on anything. :( Also, do you know if there are any trials going on for IV Vitamin C and Stage IV? I've heard this is helpful with other cancers but cannot get my onc to give it to me. Thanks all, and take care! Liz",

I was not expecting the dexamethasone. The pharmacist told me to take Zofran around the clock for 48 hours, which I did. I had just a tiny bit of nausea off and on up until yesterday and today I am feeling fine. The 3rd day after (yesterday/Monday) was the worst for me with the fatigue and some nausea, but today I feel loads better. I don't think my pain is gone at all, but some areas seem a bit better (mainly my neck, which I am thankful for). DEBeachgirl--thank you for sharing about the hair loss. My hair grew back after finishing the Abraxane in January, and my oncologist wasn't sure what to tell me, since the other ladies he has taking it now apparently are already bald. The pharmacist told me the exact same thing that happened to you, so I will be curious to see what happens to my hair. It was previously thicker than it is now, but I wouldn't call it thin at this point. We'll see. :) Liz",
