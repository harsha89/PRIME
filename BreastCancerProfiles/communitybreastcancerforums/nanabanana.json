I feel alone so hoping this will be the place I can be myself and get answers. I am worried about my job. Did anyone lose their job because they were sick longer than they had leave time to be off work? I have 12 weeks of chemo starting Aug. 26th and 6 weeks of radiation to follow. I have only 12 weeks of leave so worried about my job being secure.",
