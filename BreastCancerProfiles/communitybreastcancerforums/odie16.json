TML - your post really touched me. I too am comforted that I am not insane.....I have bc on the left but a calcification cluster on the right so I have opted for BMX with t/e. Since I failed my very first mammy, not real keen on going thru one again so the peace of mind was my deciding factor. Negative BRCA and no family history. guess just rotten luck but finding comfort to be in company of such strong women. I am nervous about surgery but more worried about the treatment after surgery. No radiation (woohoo!) but hormone therapy and likely chemo...(boo!!) Totally hate the not knowing but have to wait for pathology results from surgery to determine treatment. Guess it is a good thing I am on the east coast where I have earthquakes & hurricanes to distract me....  Appreciate all the comments more than I can say.... Really helps. ",

Pain is much less than a c-section and nothing an Advil can't manage, just don't overdo it. I made a weeks' meals/casseroles ahead and froze them so we could just bake & eat the first week and did bother attempting laundry for a week or so. As noted the drains were a pain in the @%$ but have an important job. Just use neosporin to keep the drain spots from drying out and it will be fine. Having those removed was easy too. Felt funny but no pain. Hope this helps and feel free to PM me if I can help further.",

Grannydukes - LOVE LOVE LOVE the idea of working on the list..... But lord that could take time....lol Funny this must have been the week for us ladies. I too put in a complaint with the billing office for the anesthesiologist office. I initially called a month ago to set up a short payment plan (split the bill over two months) but was told by the lady that it was unacceptable as they would only take full payment. And not in a very nice tone either. Needless to say it took me a month to cool down and call back. The ladie I spoke to this time was very professional & courteous and offered me the same option I requested last month. Asked if there was a record of my prior call and she told me it was noted by the other rep but no reason as to why payment or a plan was set up. I explained it to her and she was totally apologetic. Promised to let the supervisor know as her hatefulness & behaviour was uncalled for.  Hope I haven't missed anyone as I love you all. I find great comfort in these boards and appreciate all the support & friendship.... May be MIA for a few days sometime in the next week or two as my grandmother is not doing well. She has stopped eating or taking fluids so we know it is only a matter of time now. I only hope she can go with peace, love & dignity.   Hugs to you all............",

Have never regretted my decision for one minute and was vindicated  when I went to the oncologist the first time. He was reading thru my chart and commented that I had a bmx even though my cancer was only on the left. I mentioned the calcification cluster on the other side and told him my intent was to only have to suck up & do this once. Didn't want to risk doing it again in 5-10 years. Without looking up, he kinda smirked and said \"You likely would have.\" I know there are no guarantees but I went with what felt right to me and I think that is really all we can do.",

Glad to hear your mom is doing better. I was the caregiver to my mom with Alzheimers so I totally understand the conflicting emotions at times. Had guilt even when doing the right thing. Be good to yourself and feel free to PM me if you ever want to ramble...  Soyaandpepper - I have similar stats to you and did not do chemo as my oncotype came in at 13 so my MO did not feel the benefits outweighed the risks. Wishing you peace in whatever decision you feel it right for you. Hugs to all my sistas. As previously mentioned, I am coming up on my one year anniversary of diagnosis this weekend. While at the time, my world seemed shattered, I have found strength I didn't know I had and have been touched by the outpouring of love & kindness. Truly have a new appreciation for the little things previously taken for granted and could not have made it without you ladies. ",

(thrilled not to need chemo as the long term effects scare the bejeebies out of me) ... I have changed my diet to eat more food in its natural form and eliminated any Soy but have not gone vegetarian. Not a huge meat eater but do like a good steak and get protein from chicken. I do try to buy organic or hormone free meat & milk. May sound overcautious but I figure with my age, I need to do as much as reasonably possible to reduce any recurrence risk....Wishing you the best luck on treatment, go with your heart......",

It was always such a special holiday growing up and I married a man who becomes the excitable little boy at the holidays.. He doesn't shop at all during the year but loves to go Christmas shopping, wraps better than me and truly loves the season. That said, it has been different thou since we lost his dad 4 yrs ago and my mom 3 yrs ago... The kids are now grown and it just is harder for me to get caught up in the season anymore. Hate to change the subject but need someone to interject some common sense and talk me off the ledge for a minute. In the past 24 hours, I have developed a visible & palpatable pea sized knot just beside the my healing incision on the cancer side.. I am trying really hard to just breathe but am freaking out.... And I am not sure who I call... My exchange surgery was 3 weeks ago.. Do I call the PS, the BS or my ob/gyn? Or whoever can see me first? HELP!!!",
