At least I didn't have to do rads! I've been wondering about te fills during chemo. I've read about some women doing both,  but my bs and onc said it would wait. ..my ps says he disagrees. Like Lisa advised,  I'm going to search this site before I go to google.   Lisa,  thank you for posting such a great,  detailed list and encouragement.   I look forward to doing the same in a year or so. For now,  I need to go shopping!   :)",

It only aches a little, so that is also better than I expected.   It may seem really weird,  but I'm kind of excited to be moving forward.   I'm ready to get this done! ",

Stay strong! I don't post often, but i read every post until I'm caught up, and I am grateful for everyone's advice, encouragements, and experiences.

It's great to put faces with the names, and to see glimpses of everyone's lives and experiences on this journey. I have to admit, I've been dragging my feet about shopping for any headwear. Seeing how prepared, and CUTE, many of you are is making me start some online shopping. Any tips on scarf sizing?  I will have my second infusion on Tuesday, but I haven't heard from my docs. I'm wondering if i need to take benedryl BEFORE the chemo and neulasta shot, or if they are going to change something since I had an allergic reaction last time. Has anybody else had an allergic reaction? I wonder what the standard response might be? I guess I'll call them tomorrow. My story is this: I turned 40, went for the first obligatory mammo, and here we are. I have two lovely daughters (8 and 12) and an awesome husband of 17 years. I teach middle school language arts in south Alabama on the gulf coast. We are avid college football fans; War Eagle! I'm planning on working full time throughout this journey, and I'm so grateful for the wonderful group of students I have this year. They have been very supportive and caring. I'm glad to see all the posts from new and old members. Stay warm the rest of this week and stay positive!",

Friday night I had an allergic reaction. I have never been allergic to anything in my life, so I guess it was chemo or the shot. Red, itchy rash all over and light headed with weird breathing. The hospital gave me benadryl, pepcid, and steroid shots, so that helped a lot Friday night. Saturday was just a steady dosing of benadryl all day and evening. The rash is much better today! What a relief since I go back to work tomorrow and face my middle schoolers! So far, no other se's. Overall, I'm pretty positive about it. I'm sending love and prayers to all of you who start your chemo this week.",

It seems a little easier...I woke up with more energy today, and it seemed to last most of the day...or at least the hours I was at work. I hope that it is easy for you too. And, no more neulasta shots! Wooohoo!",
