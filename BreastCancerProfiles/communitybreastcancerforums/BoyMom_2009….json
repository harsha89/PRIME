I am quite nervous to meet with the onco tomorrow even though I want to get going with my treatment.  It's a love/hate thing, I guess.  I love that we have drugs to kill off cancer cells but I hate the thought of losing my hair, feeling sick, and etc.  As with all of things that I've had to do since finding out about the cancer, I will move forward and GET ER DONE!

I have been looking at wigs online but have not yet walked into a wig store, nor have I ever tried a wig on.  So, I have a couple of dumb wig questions for anyone who would care to respond: 1.  Has anyone ordered a wig online? 2.  How are the wigs secured so that they do not slip or fall off? 3.  Are they scratchy? I've found some cute hats on headcovers.com.  I haven't ordered any yet but they seem to be a little more up to date than other sites that I have seen. Thanks - Lisa",
