I went for a breast ultrasound after i knocked myself in my right breast, (got a hardened lump) and it came up as a dark shadow, but nothing definitive and nothing came up on the mammogram. The breast clinic said to come back in 6 months, i waited (foolishly!) 5 months and after another ultrasound they said the dark shadow was still there, they did a biopsy and 7 days later i found out from my GP i had stage 3, grade 3 BC at 34 yrs old. I don't want to scare you, but for any lump that seems suspicious i would demand a biopsy, you might have a little/tiny scar, but its all about timing with these things and peace of mind :)",

Hey hammie, I had surgery before chemo, because they originally thought the tumour was under 5cm, but it turned out to be bigger than expected. They did chemo as an insurance policy. Do you have children? I don't, but hope to in the future. Doc says I must wait the full 5 years due to my high risk. I'll be 40 then Hey Libby, it just means that there are more cancer cells in your body as a result of the larger size, compared to a smaller tumour. They've had more time to multiple I suppose.",

My surgeon organised them, as she wanted to see if it had gone metastatic beyond the nodes to the organs. I would have thought thats fairly routine, unless it hadn't gone to the nodes, then there would be no reason to do these tests. However, I do know that a lot of oncologists are reluctant to conduct MRIs after treatment (chemo/rads), unless you have any symptoms of it going metastatic, because they say the stats don't show any difference between those tests and symptoms. Although i would have to disagree, surely prevention (in terms of MRIs) are better than cure. The counter argument is that MRIs pass off high levels of radiation, which in itself is a bad thing, esp for a cancer patient.",

The general surgeon should have explained your biopsy results and the up coming surgery. Maybe delay the surgery by a few days and meet with your surgeon again and take someone with you, as it can often be a surreal meeting the first time around, esp as most people are in shock. Obviously you don't want to delay surgery too long (more than a week), but you need to be happy with what you're agreeing too. Having someone else attend is also helpful for anything you may have missed and asking questions. I went in with a list of questions and just read them out 😀 Good luck",

I think if you'v had bc cancer and are PR/ER positive, then minimising any of the risks mentioned above (which can cause weight gain and increase estrogen production) and introducing exercise is a good way to go. Sure there are people who will get cancer regardless and who may have a genetic mutation and disposition to it, but I'd rather know I did everything i could (the second time around) to prevent it from coming back. Especially because if you have had it once, then we know the body is capable of creating that same dynamic again given the right conditions. Admittedly it is hard to stay on the healthyfood wagon, but if I do have a treat, then I am way more committed to burn it off these days.",

I'm considered high risk purely because of my age (34yrs), tumour size, stage and grade, but we have the best treatment out there, then we have ever had, so don't get bogged down. I try to ignore the stats and get on with my second chance of life. Positive thinking is so important.",

I'd say your aches are from the chemo drugs. Try having epsom salts in a bath and also manganese supplement pills, i found they work wonders! I also found going out for 30 mins walk a day actually helped with achy muscles, its sounds strange, but getting out and about was good for me mentally as well. I had horrible metallic taste in mouth from AC for the first few days after chemo was administered, i found i probably ate a bit less, but made sure it was nutritional (green smoothies etc) and what my body needed. I stuck to bland food, like chicken soup etc.. the blander the better. Fruit is fine, i found watermelon great for getting riding of the metallic taste. Make sure you stay away from grapefruit, apparently it can cause adverse effects on BC, which is not what you want.",

Mammogram is likely to be useless to you, as young women have dense breasts and it struggles to find anything. With your family history I would be concerned, it doesn't matter what age you are, cancer has no limitations. If you're concerned go to the doctors. Worse case you have one of the Brca genes and if you do, then cancer can come out in the younger generation, 10 years before your mother. Hopefully it's nothing serious, hormones playing around, but still I would push it for peace of mind. Even if you don't have cancer, I would still push for gene testing, because you'll be able to potentially reduce your risks. I was diagnosed at 34.Good luck",

It's a structure type of how cancer can grow. Solitary to me would be more preferable and easier to see clear margins. As previous ladies have said once you know the full pathology and have an action plan, you be able to attack this thing head on. Good luck!",

I know when most people hear the big 'c' they automatically think the worst, but it doesn't have to be that way and it isn't for many. There are many survivors out there!Ok times are tough, but as you move through this experience, things will get easier, so be strong and positive and you will get through it 😀",

My diagnosis is similar to yours, just wondering if you changed anything afterwards- in terms of diet/exercise? Did you have children prior to diagnosis? Or have you had any since? Just wondering as I am 35 years old with no children, but it'ssomething I would like to do in the future, as long as I'm OK of course. Thanks again, 😀",
