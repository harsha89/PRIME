Didn't think I'd be bothered, but I hated it. The tech gave me some glasses that helped A LOT the glasses had mirrors in them that allowed me to see out the end of the machine. Before that, they were telling me to stop talking. I wasn't, I was praying in my head (but muscles often move when we think of talking) because of my nerves. If you can, ask about the glasses. I think they're called MRI prism glasses or something. I think you might be a.to find them on Amazon, but the place I went had them on hand. Good luck on the test itself and the results!",
