I'll provide history first, then diagnosis. History- age 26, found lump, they couldn't aspirate it, so I had a lumpectomy. was a complex fibroadenoma. age 28, OB/GYN found a lump and sent me in for an ultrasound. no cancer was found (don't remember what they said, and I don't have the reports). was told I should keep eye on my breasts, go to OB/GYN and start my mammos at 35. was not good about doing self-checks. I moved... got a new OB/GYN, gave him my history and he said since there is no BC in my family, I would be fine with my first mammo at 40. Ok-- now to date... turning 40 in may :(. had a mammo sched for April, but I felt lumps in my right breast, which is the same one with the history. they moved up the mammo to Feb 21 for my standard baseline test. Left Breast came back as no significant abnormalities, very dense breast tissue. Right Breast- study incomplete, fold in skin. went back for retest. took additional mammo screens on the right breast (and I don't know if it was successful or if they found anything). Because I complained of a lump, they decided to do an ultrasound. the tech did the US and said everything looked normal-- then suddenly got up and go the doctor. the doctor did the US... and she said there are cysts and showed me the cysts. she said some appear to have fluid and debris in the them and some appear to be solid. there were like 8-10 in one area. my report was 'your exam shows findings with high probability of being benign (non-cancerous). shotrt term follow-up is recommended' and she wrote in probable complicated cysts (3-6mm). told me they were like the size of a pen tip and not to worry... come back in 6 months for a follow-up ultrasound. OK- I feel like a major worry wart... but I am now worried about the possibility that some were solid? I was just scared and didn't ask qusetions. she told me cysts aren't cancer. but can they ever turn into cancer is my question. And what about the so-called solid ones-- those are cysts? I am in your same boat and not sure what to do. not sure if this helps... but you are not alone in not knowing what to do. do you have a re-check in 6 months too? hang in there!",
