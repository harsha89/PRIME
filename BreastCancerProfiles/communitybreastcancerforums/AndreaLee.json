If there's anything positive about this whole awful ordeal I guess it's that I have nice perky breasts lol All my help and family is gone as of today and it hit me hard ...

I know my plastic surgeon put some numbing stuff ( don't know the proper terminology) in my chest to help with pain - it is wearing off . So, maybe that's what u are experiencing. Did u say you were doing this with out pain meds ? Shew !! you say you aren't strong, but I would have to disagree - you must be . I'm slowly getting off meds because I hate them but definitely still need them at night . Hugs and stay positive & strong ! ",

Those things are the devil ! Still very sore but able to keep the pain meds to a minimum! A lot of chest pressure but I do believe that's because of the implants they placed ( I feel like I have boulders on my chest) still taking a lot of naps , drinking a lot of water and just taking it easy . It's hard to do but I know that's the only way to get better . Got my pathology report back and they found residual cancer - so I made the right decision in a mastectomy. I WAS NOT cancer free like I was told ! Love and hugs to you all! Question : nobody told me anything about arm exercises ... What are they ?",
