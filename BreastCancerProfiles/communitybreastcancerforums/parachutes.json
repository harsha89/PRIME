I must admit I've been quite the stalker of this website for months and thought my first post should be a contribution. So I thought I could share some of my very fresh journey with you. I am exactly 32 days out from my NSM, with TE placement, SNB and for the first time since the surgery I feel \"almost\" like myself again. Remember no two bodies are the same so when women say everybody recovers differently take that to heart. A month prior to surgery I tried hard to take EXTRA good care of myself; spin class, hiking, no coffee, caffeine, very limited sugar. I went to get a massage which was nice but didn't do anything for my anxiety but the gal was so sweet and sent me a lymph node video excersice, herself doing an upper arm excercise, and another yoga video specifically for carpal tunnel (basically stretching the same upper body muscles). I did those for the four days leading up to my surgery. What I really got a lot from was a Reiki session three days prior to surgery. I had never done one before and it was an amazing amount of stress released. I was not sleeping and I was having anxiety ridden night terrors mixed with awful dreams. The Reiki session allowed me too finally relax and shut my mind off. I truly believe it was because of the lymph node excercises that helped the dye move very quickly when I went in for the sentinel node injection which was surprisingly not painful and because of the Reiki session pre-op anxiety was more manageable. I did ask my doctor for Xanax which I took a couple of times to sleep and before the node injection. I also took arnica four days before surgery. Nothing day the before or day of. What I wish I would have done was taken more stool softeners more days before surgery. During pre-op I asked for a anti-nausea patch they put behind my ear and I had no nausea issues at all. After surgery I wished I'd asked more questions about the expander and its placement. The TE was placed over my muscle, stitched to my muscle in three different places, and filled with 120cc of air. It's a 400cc expander that goes waaaay under my armpit. My breast was totally covered with transparent techaderm dressing with my nipple exposed. At home I had Hydrocodone, Cephalexin (antibiotic), and Prochlorperazine (which I never took). I neglected my nipple for two weeks and regret it. They gave me bacitracin two weeks later, after the fact, to put on my nipple which I should have been putting on immediately. I also feel I should have been stimulating my nipple more as the upper half actually responses to touch whereas the bottom half doesn't. My husband started giving my massages everyday with healing oil around the surrounding tissue and muscles. Another regret, I left the hospital with no exercise pamphlet (told only to not lift my arm above 90 degrees, no exercise, and walk like a grandma for two weeks) and no guidance of bra or no bra. The expander was so painful it literally felt like it was too big for the space like trying to fit into skinny jeans! So I hope some ladies get something from the following as others may think it's a bit hippy-dippy but these are some of the things I did to aid my healing: made a big pot of bone broth soup with elk bone marrow (husband's a hunter) and drank a cup everyday; took Staphysagria 30c, Arnica Montana 30c, and Hypericum Perforatum 200ck for 10 days; made a shake everyday with yogurt, Bio-K plus probiotic, banana, protein powder, and super foods powder; my sister sent me some special tea and my husband would brew a pot everyday and add a Smooth Move tea bag to it. I would add Ashwagandha, Milk Thistle, chlorophyll drops and a lemon to it (not tasty at all!). I saw immediate reduction of brusing and swelling within the first week! Once the dressing came off and had my first fill (day 16), I started with my sister's scar healing oils and am completely amazed how good the scar already look. She sells them! I got my drains out day 5 and day 16. My output was directly related to how much I was moving around. Therefore, I sacrificed exercising (even walking) and limiting my arm movement in hopes of reducing the output and I believe my ROM suffered. PS wanted output to be below 25cc two days in a row. At 3 weeks I couldn't even lift my arm out straight and had to pretty much demand PT because I'm so freaked out. I didn't so well on the Hydrocodone. It wreaked havoc on my stomach causing a lot of abdominal pain and made me super groggy. I was just trying to get away with stool softeners and Smooth Move tea but couldn't take the abdominal pain so I took a stronger laxative and spent two days with the porcelain gods. Terrible! Day 8 I was switched over to Tramadol (a non-narcotic) and did okay with just Smooth Move. I didn't start weaning my pain meds until day 14 and was off them day 24 (lots of Tylenol and IBU in between). I'm lucky enough to telework so week 3 I worked 15hrs and week 4 I worked 35hrs. Day 30 was my first half day back to the office. The pain from the TE has gotten better with every fill (3rd fill now at 240cc). Sleeping is still my nemesis and ROM isn't where I would like it to be but yesterday I hiked 2 hours and then...wait for it...went to a concert! Ladies, it's hard to see your progress when you are in the midst of it. I have been OCD with my Fitbit just to have proof that I am indeed getting better even if it is two steps forward and one step back. It was hard for me to not compare myself to the women that got off pain meds 3 days after surgery, to the women that had their drains removed quickly and especially to the women who started running a week after surgery. As one of my favorite artist says, \"You can't rush your healing\". So take time to find that space within you to breathe and just surrender. Each of you (and even the women not on these forums) is in my thoughts and prayers. ðŸ’œðŸ’œ",

I tried a few alternative treatments that I felt really made a difference. I had a reiki session that truly calmed my soul. I also started going to an acupuncture co-op. I now go for regular treatments and that has really helped my sleep. I also listen to a lot of Pema Chordon. My nightmares, panic attacks, were really causing me to actually fear going to sleep but I think going into my second surgery here real soon is a very different journey. Anyway, just throwing some alternatives out there. Good luck.",
