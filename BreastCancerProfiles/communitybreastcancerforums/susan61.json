I got tinkling and numbness in fingers and toes that started moving up my legs and arms.  Put on medication, now only have it on toes and fingers (with medication).  If I forget to take medication it goes up my legs and arms.  May be pernament the doctor said.  Now why did he not stop after I told him on the first dose of Taxol.   Has anyone had this side effect and did it get better?  My long term disability Company (only been on one month) just sent me paperwork for SS disability.  I frecked out.  I love my job and was hoping to go back.  Kindof scared to start my 6 weeks of radiation.  Help me...if anyone has experienced this please be straight with me...can I get better??//",
