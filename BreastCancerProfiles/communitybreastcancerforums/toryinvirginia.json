I'm petrified as I wait for test results from the pathologist. I was told 7 samples were taken, to apply ice packs, and wait for a call sometime next week. I have little to no family medical history and am on pins and needles. So here I sit, tender breasts, anxiety off the chart, reading more on the internet than I probably should be.and waiting. Any information from someone with a similar experience would be wonderful and most appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
