I have the TEs in and then found out I need radiation due to poor margins. My PS wants to finish with expansion and put the implants in before radiation. I had a hard time finding info to back this up, seemed he was the only one who did it this way. Can you please elaborate more on your experience and how you are feeling. Did your PS give you the option to do rads first and then implants? How did you make that decision? Any info would be helpful. thanks!",

My stage one IDC cancer was found on a screening MRI that I requested due to family hx of breast cancer Had to have MRI biopsy because wasn't able to see on ultrasound. Evidently, the cancer was \"very deep and close to the chest wall\". Morning after surgery my doc makes rounds and says that nodes were negative and he didn't even see a tumor during surgery. One week later the path report is in and I have margins in the fascia. My surgeon admits he didn't take out the fascia because the breast tissue came out so easily. He is now recommending radiation, which I wanted to avoid by having the mastectomy. I'm really angry and don't understand why he didn't take out the fascia not to mention some of the chest wall in the first place considering the depth and that removing the fascia seems to be standard for mastectomies. I plan on callng first thing Monday and getting all of my reports and discussing his decision making process but I'd love to know what you all thnk of this. Dx 7/21/2011, IDC, 4cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
