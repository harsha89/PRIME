I know that this means a small tumor but thats all.  Just so you know my mom was 47 the first time and she is 56 now.  Also the first time she had a lumpectomy and radiation.  This time she is having a mastectomy.  We have not seen a cancer doctor yet just the regular doctor and the surgeon.  Her surgery is next week.  what kind of treatments are possible for her now, cus i know she cant have radiation again?  Thank you for any and all information.  I am the type that wants to know everything.  Log in to post a reply",
