We were told it's about 5 hours, it's around 5 hours already and we're still waiting... is this time normal? I'm getting a bit worried. Best wishes to you strong girls who'll have your surgeries soon. 💓",

I try to be more optimistic about it and refrain from imagining the worst; bad scenarios occassionally slip but I'm countering it with more positive thoughts on recovery. And the email suggestion is a good idea too! Thanks so much! DATNY, I appreciate the info on the biopsy results and the words of encouragement! I was actually mistaken on the biopsy, it's scheduled tomorrow, Wednesday instead of last Monday. We're not sure yet when the results will be released. I'm really, really, really hoping it will get better soon! TheSnowQueen, first off, I'm sorry to hear about your condition! But I genuinely admire your and your family's courage and positivity on this! The optimism and strength to carry on of you and your loved ones can definitely go a long way on this battle. I can now see the importance of optimism and positivity for this matter. I wish you and your family well as you go through this. I know it may not seem much but I sincerely appreciate all your posts here, you have no idea how much you've helped me the past few days. I was an emotional wreck this weekend and considered taking days off from work but your advices really did help a lot! Again, many thanks to all of you, we can do this. ♥",

      "Content": "Feb 15, 2018 04:52PM - edited Feb 15, 2018 04:54PM by Yuno I'm glad to hear about those facts, DATNY! I'd say mom is pretty healthy right now when it comes to eating, she's starting to do work on simple exercises/yoga again and get more sleep. I'm at least certain she'll have an easier time adapting to a more healthy lifestyle soon while getting treatment. And that bit about knowing other people's cancer diagnosis is almost exactly the same as how my mom felt! She also just knew that some of her friends also had BC, one had chemo and another had a mastectomy as well. It's really sad how a lot have had to experience cancer, but amidst that it's also a relief to know that it's not always an instant death sentence, and people can carry on their normal lives while receiving treatment. It's good to know about how you and those people you know keep your heads up for longetivity. :) I'll definitely post again after we get the results. Thank you very much for all the helpful information! I'll be sure to keep an eye on the cancer type, stage, and the lymph nodes and discuss them in the appropriate forums. Also thanks a lot for that bit about the CT scan and bone scan, we're not in the US and I think it's worth bringing up to my mom to check for any distant metastatis. All your kindess and wonderful words have helped me tremendously, thank you so very much. Keeping you in my thoughts and prayers! :) DJmammo, thank you for informing me about that! I'll also relay it to my parents so they can ask the doctors which procedures will be recommended. It's so helpful knowing the different steps done for each situation!",

What scares me is the possibility of the stage going higher after mastectomy, I think I heard my mom's Stage 2b. I'm tring my best to be strong about this, it's just difficult sometimes to digest some facts. And the other people are right, it's more scary when there's no plan for treatment yet! Hugs and prayers to you and your family. Sjacobs146, I'm sorry to hear you've been going through this as well. It definitely must be harded for you moms emotionally and physically. I guess it scares me too to know the all the pain and adjustments my mom would endure while having treatment. As for the survival rate, I'm so relieved to see that statistic. My mother also had a friend who had stage 3 BC before and is now cancer free after 5 about years of treatment that had chemotheraphy. My friend's aunt also had Stage 2 before and lived for 40+ more years. I'm wishing you all the best for your journey. I'll be thinking about you in my thoughts and prayers. Please take care!",

My mother is 54 years old and around the 2nd week of January, she told me she found a lump in her breast and said it was quite painful. She had a mammogram some time this week I think, and we'll be going to the hospital tomorrow for her biopsy. I was told this afternoon that she should undergo surgery to have the lump removed some time in the future... That's all I know at the moment. My mom and I are very close but it seems mutually apparent that neither of us want to bring up the topic, so I just get \"proper\" updates from my dad. I'm very scared about the whole situation and this has bothered me so much that it affects my performance at work. I cry every other night because of the fear of her having breast cancer. I love her so much and can't imagine her gone because of BC. Please tell me how to properly deal with this. I'm a young female adult, 23 years old. I know I should be better than this but I can't help but feel like a helpless dependent child because I can't seem to compose myself. :( If it matters, my mother's side doesn't have a history of breast cancer, I think. And she's asian. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. Have a great day/night ahead. Log in to post a reply",

They came home a few hours ago and confirmed that my mom has cancer. I didn't break down or anything, I did my best to be calm about it. To my surprise they were unusually still fine with the news; the doctor told them that the lump has been found early and said it should be very treatable, so it's kind of like a \"good news\" amidst a terrible one. For the treatment, my mom said that one of the options the doctor gave is to have her whole left breast removed (masectomy?), and she can choose to have a radio-something afterwards... sorry I forgot the term. She said the doctor described the procedure as having a device that shines a light over your breast to do something about the cells(?). She also mentioned about lymph nodes found in her left breast. My mom and her sister agreed that she should have a masectomy done just to be sure, some of my other relatives haven't given their opinions yet. I guess I also agree for her to get her whole left breast removed? I'm obviously not knowledgeable at this. My dad just randomly cried from relief and fear, I actually think he's the one having a harder time accepting the situation than me or my mom. I was also told that my brother (who's abroad in the atm) is panicking and kept asking the remaining years my mother has left, he's so worried and blowing things out of proportion.. It's so weird to feel how I was weak and afraid for my mom yet now it seems I'm the one who has to give my other family members strength and comfort to go through this. But despite the cancer news, I'm still overall happy that this got noticed early before it's spread to her body. I'm hoping all goes well for her, and for others going through this as well. I'm so happy to have found this place. There are so many helpful people who share their experiences, give information on their condition, give advices-- both for treatment and handling it emotionally, and most especially all the support given. While reading other topics, it still breaks my heart to see how many women are going through this, especially to you moms out there. A day doesn't pass where I cannot help but think about how the others here feel and deal with their BC. You strong women have all my love and support. Oops I didn't notice how long my post was becoming, sorry about that! Thanks again to all of you, I'm truly grateful for all the help you've given. Hugs to you and your families. ❤",

Before sleeping my mom said to me \"To be honest, I'm already very nervous.\" then I just told her who wouldn't, and said everything should be fine when the lump gets removed. I know it's a silly thing to say especially when I'm not knowledgeable about BC but I was just trying to assure her that she's not in trouble. :/ In the event that there may be BC it should be very treatable right? Especially at early detection? :( It's already morning and it seems my parents left me and went straight to the doctors. I'm really hoping it's just a benign lump and nothing life-threatening. Will the results show immediately after the biopsy? It's kind of difficult for me still to reach out to my parents and ask. I don't think I can do my best yet to gather up the courage when approaching the topic. Again, thank you both very much for your replies. Take care!",

Currently I'm just at home lying in bed, my parents are out and went to the hospital to get the results. It's around 12:20pm right now and from what I heard last night they should have left sometime in the morning awhile ago to go to the doctors. I'm not receiving any calls or texts from them... Should I call them? I'm so scared at what they might tell me. I have no appetite to eat nor do any other thing but but lie here and ponder about what might happen. :'(",
