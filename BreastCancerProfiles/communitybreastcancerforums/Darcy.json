I had wire placement excisional biopsies under local, ultrasound guided core needle biopsy, stereotactic core biopsy, wire guided excisional under sedation and local, and SNB injections. Most of them have been deep or in the center of my breast or around the nipple. I was told I had dense breasts. Luckily I never had pain and I always had the same team who are women physicians in Maryland. They are also very nice. I would say where they are but I don't know if that's allowed here.  I just want women to know it is possible to have biopsies and surgery without pain and I am thankful they never hurt me. I know they used lidocaine and it worked for me but maybe it doesn't work for everyone. Maybe there is some other kind of thing they could give women if lidocaine doesn't work in them. ",
