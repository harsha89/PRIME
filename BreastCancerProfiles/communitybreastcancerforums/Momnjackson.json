      "Content": "Sep 22, 2011 10:41AM - edited Sep 22, 2011 10:42AM by Momnjackson Do you have a family history of breast cancer? Is the lump painful and/or moveable? It's good that they at least ordered an ultrasound for you. I can't stand when doctors diagnose lumps by feeling it alone. So try to be happy that you were tested. In my opinion, a lump that is that size and palpable is not necessarily normal tissue. It doesn't mean it's breast cancer either though. If you continue to feel weird about it, I think you should see a breast specialist. She/he will be able to give you an expert clinical examination plus a biopsy which will give you added pieace of mind. It's nerve racking but really the only option for someone who is scared. I demand you see a breast specialist right away if you have a family history. If you don't then you can probably afford to wait through another cycle if you want to... but I'd still go ASAP just because you seem worried.  Honestly, I don't know what it means when a lump doesn't show on ultrasound. Mine (biopsied benign) didn't show either. It's very weird and I don't exactly know why that happens. Good luck and I hope everything works out well.",

I'm so new to this and I don't want to be submissive if I should be assertive. Thanks!!!! Big bear hug to all the ladies here. Log in to post a reply",

She said her biopsy showed fibroadeoma and excisional showed cancer. I don't know how I'm supposed to move forward from here knowing that those horrible mistakes can happen.is that rare? i'm also reading that most people have fibroadenomas removed. That wasn't recommended for me even though mine is painful and not small. I don't know that I can go through the waiting process again especially if my results could come out different. On a scale of 1-10, how confident can I be that this is ok? 1 being not confident and 10 being confident. THank you so much again. I'm getting very nervous now.",

I might be misunderstanding some of your post but... cancer can disappear? Bless your heart for helping. So you would run with this? I want to run with this but it's so hard. My lump was sore for about two weeks until getting my period and now it doesn't hurt. I keep thinking that's good news until I read about a woman who was not only misdiagnosed as having a fibroadenoma (even with a core needle bx!!!!) and her lump changed with her cycle. I can't seem to win. All signs point to taking this lump out but I don't really want to. I want to live my life. Thank you barb! <3 you are right, the google is a vicious temptress!",

I had a mammogram and ultrasound show nothing even though the lump is about 2cm or more. Therefore a core needle biopsy was done without mammogram or ultrasound involvement. It was done at probably the most reputable clinic in my area. I don't live near major hospitals or big name cancer centers. I think it was probably the only breast specific clinic in my area. It was not given bi-rads of course but the doctor assessed it as probably benign in the clinical summary of my path report. I don't know what my best plan of action is now. The nurse reassured me for now. I was just wondering if you all thought this was a good place for me to stop worrying. I;m sure the vast majority of women diagnosed weren;t misled by the diagnostics but some are so that's very scary. I have to stop googling. I really do.",

My surggeon obviously made it all sound like good news and didn't make any followup suggestions besides returning in six months. All I want to do is just enjoy this news but  I don't want to be naive about my health. If I need to go back and have this thing taken out then I guess I'll do that. Thnx for the advice:)",

I'm trying to enjoy that information but was wondering how common/likely it is for cancer to be growing in, under or around a fibroadenoma.?? The UOQ is the most common site for BC so I'm concerned that there's something vicious hiding under my fibro (which is maybe a half-inch long). Also, a lumpectomy was not indicated by my surgeon for this thing but should I have one anyway? Would you just do what the doctor recommends or would you insist on removing it? Thnx!
