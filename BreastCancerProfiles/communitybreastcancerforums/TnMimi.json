I found a mass in my left breast a few months ago. It's about the size of a marble, but not exactly round. It doesn't hurt and I never found it during my self breast exams. I was leaned over in the shower shaving and felt a \"pulling\" sensation in my left breast. My GP thought it was two cysts side by side, but he sent me for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound. The radiologist said, \"nothing to worry about\"... we didn't see anything. I went back to my GP a few weeks later, to have my thyroid level checked and mentioned to him that nothing was found on my mammogram. He felt of the lump again and decided to send me on for a surgical eval. In the meantime, I saw my GYN last Friday because my PAPs have been coming back bad. In fact, he said he wasn't even going to do one that day because he knew it would come back bad. So... I'm waiting until May for a repeat PAP and/or colposcopy. He did feel of the lump in my breast and said that if he though it was a cyst, he would just do a FNA while there and send the contents for biopsy. Well... he said \"Nope\"... he said it didn't feel like a cyst to him and for me to follow through with the surgical evaluation. He said that because the mass was so deep, near the chest wall, that's probably why the mammogram didn't pick it up. So... my current symptoms include... a non-painful mass in the bottom of my left breast (deep), with occasional left nipple discomfort (sometimes pain), and right scapula pain (which my GP feels is unrelated). I'm scheduled to see an orthopeadist for the right shoulder/scapula/back pain. Like I said, my surgical evaluation is Monday, and my GYN believes that an excisional biopsy would be the next step. Thank you for sharing your experience. ",
