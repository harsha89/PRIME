I thought maybe it was bruising at first. Then it started leaking blue dye. I quickly realized it was from the nuclear dye they inject before surgery. It turned to cell necrosis in that area and had to be removed by scrapping weekly until it was gone. It left a scar and delayed reconstruction. The doctor didn't even know what it was when I went in. Now I have developed a red spot on the same breast. Doctor says its my breast reacting to the expanders. Unfortunately this whole thing is a work in progress. Not even the doctors know what to expect sometimes. Stay on top of any little thing that seems off to you. Keep your head up. It will all work itself out eventually. Prayers my fellow warrior.",

The tests that see if you carry the gene in my opinion are worthless. I have a strong family history of cancer and my testing came back negative and I still had cancer. You can have the gene and never get cancer. Or you can not have the gene and still have cancer. The other tests I had were the oncotype dx and mamaprint to determine the nature of the tumors. This helps you decide if chemotherapy will be helpful based on your chance of recurrence. Again it is just a measure. The last two tests are helpful because it shows the nature of tumors to see exactly what you are dealing with. Also, if you are low chance of recurrence then they usually will tell you to forgo chemotherapy. My mamaprint came out high risk. So chemotherapy is recommended. I googled the accuracy of the test and it said 90% accuracy if it says low recurrence rate by only 25% accurate if it says high risk. So again, it is a guide.",

The cancer returned less than a year after my mastectomy. I believe this is because they did a needle biopsy and it brought the cancer cells to the skin. So even after my mastectomy I have been dealing with this cancer again. A mastectomy can always be done. You can't ever go back once you have made that choice. I am not a fan of women having mastectomies based on genetic testing. My testing came back negative even with my family history. Looking back. I should have done lumpectomy and radiation. I was trying to save myself the headache of multiple surgeries, treatment, and recurrence. In the end I've already had 5 surgeries, will undergo chemotherapy and radiation, and have at least two more surgeries to go. Since you have a family history of cancer. Let your doctor know its a concern for you and be proactive with your testing. Do not do mammogram. They do not show most tumors and cause unnecessary radiation to the body which can cause cancer. Do thermal imaging regularly. Work on preventive care with nutrition and exercise. I hope this helps. In the end it is your choice.",
