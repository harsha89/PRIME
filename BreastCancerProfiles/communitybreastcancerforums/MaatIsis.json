Her Pet scan reports the cancer has not spread beyond the breast and underarm. She had her first chemo treatment today (02/03/14). I have read articles and it seems the trend is surgery to shrink/kill the cancer cells prior to surgery. Can anyone speak to their experience? Any guidance offered would be greatly appreciated.
