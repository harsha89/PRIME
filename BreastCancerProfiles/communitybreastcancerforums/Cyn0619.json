By the second week I felt much better and was Christmas shopping but not driving until the third week. I think being scared about the procedure was worse than the pain. Hope you have a speedy recovery! Cindy",

My MRI showed I had 3 lesions on \"good breast\" with vascular involvement. I ended up having 2 mammogram guided biopsies (mammo showed clustered calcifications) a week before surgery. Biopsies came back benign but my surgeon warned me pathology could show cancer after surgery. I decided on Bmx. Luckily no cancer was found on other breast but a lot of pre cancer cells were found. I asked my surgeon what made the MRI light up like that and he said he wasn't sure. My dcis on other breast didn't show on mammogram it appeared as lump and showed on ultrasound. I'm sorry I don't know what advice to give you. It seems like all of the testing has flaws. In the end I'm glad I did the BMX because I would be paranoid those cells would form into cancer and not found on my mammogram. Wishing you the best of luck. I know how frustrating confusing and stressful all of these tests are. Sorry I can't be of more help. Cindy",

Been having severe cramps with periods and spotting between periods. Had pelvic ultrasound and results were as follows: Abnormalities noted Anterior myomrtruim has appearance of possible mass or area of scarring. Pt has had no surgery. Resolving follicular cysts right ovary Slightly complex septated left ovarian cyst Scant free fluid noted within cul de sac. Primary recommends gyno consult. I have exchange next week and have small lump on incision that just appeared. Went back to plastic surgeon who says he doesn't know what it is possible alloderm folded over. He will looke during surgery. Now I'm worried I'm going into surgery to wake up and being told possible recurrence in and incision and worrying about uterine mass. Anyone else have any advice? Sorry to rant Im getting pretty upset over all of this. Thanks for your help. I appreciate it Log in to post a reply",
