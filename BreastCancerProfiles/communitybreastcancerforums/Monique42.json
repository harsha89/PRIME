I have quite of few liver lesions (biggest 1 1/2 inches) and bone mets in my skull, shoulders, ribs hips. I have worked through my treatments full-time.(nights/day shift) I have a family - husband and kids 11 and 9. The Taxotere is doable- Ive' had watery eyes, bleeding noses, swelling in both ankles and 1 arm due to infected nails- leaked- but I held my head up for battle and talked to the cancer saying - \"Take that!! You weren't in my body when I was born and you don't belong there!!\"  Sounds weird yeh??  I've prayed a lot.   When my scans came back just 2 wks ago to see what's going on.  My Liver tumor - big one- shrunk 1/2 inch and my bones are healing.  Yes healing!!!  I'm taking a break from the Taxotere for a couple of months to get healed up enough to take out the other inch in the liver.   Yes, chemo is tough, but everyone is different.  The 1st time I did Taxotere in 2001 I had no side effects other than a bit tired for a few days.   Lynn, Do battle think positive.  My moms friend is on her 10th year with liver and bone mets.  My friend also, they had given her 1 yr. - liver was full of mets - now liver is clear.   I think of my illness as chronic and everyday people are walking around with their diseases making the best of life.   I thank God everyday for my healings in my body. Lynn, put up your dukes and fight with us!!  Taxotere is doable                     Monique",

Onc decided to try Aromasin for 3 months. I had a bad reaction. I felt my liver grow harder and harder and I was very tired, bleeding nose.  I never felt anything in my liver before. ( I have lots of lesions). I took =aroumasiont for 1 1/2 months and Onc told me to stop.    I have always maintain to stay within my range for blood work. But now it is at the high range. ( Sorry I don't remember the count).   Here is the thing. I had a CT Scan of the liver and my Onc said that my liver tumors are pulsating causing scar tissue and he has difficulty seeing now.  WTF????   I'm still only on Herceptin.  Should I be more vigulent and ask to be on a oral chemo to shrink the tumors so they don't cause damage?? Does anyone else have scars in their liver from them pulsating? Thank you Monique Monique Dx 6/17/2008, 2cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, 1/4 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

We are all fighting together to save our lives, our sanity and so forth.  I'm going for my 6th tx this Thrusday and I'm on Taxotere/pimindronate/herceptin.(pimindronate is a bone builder). I have extensive bone mets and mets to the liver. It is a doable treatment as I work shift work - full-time still, although now getting exhausted. I've had a few side effects, my nails are painful and I had lessions in the mouth. - Suck on ice chips or a slurpee and wear ice mitts- that helped me.   Carman we welcome you with open arms and big hugs and I'm so sorry we all have to go through this.

For some reason my other arm was swollen to- I also had SNB, and therapist said it's less of a percent, but does happen. She says to do exercise everyday even when the swelling goes down and that I will have to be extra careful and try to set limitations or at less start slowly again to lift weights and see what happens. Frankly I'm just doing the minimum at the gyn now, until I get my nerve up to try again.",
