Hugs, Kim",

(I told myself that the first time I ever got one was a fluke that it hurt so badly and surely now, 7 years later it wouldn't hurt so much-I was dead wrong!)  Now, I'm telling myself that it may hurt, but it only lasts for a short time and then goes away.  I also found out that my doctors office has new equipment and shouldn't hurt the same way.  Making my appointment as I type!  Have a great day!",
