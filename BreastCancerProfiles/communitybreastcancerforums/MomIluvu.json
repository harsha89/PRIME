I live in Sydney, Australia at the moment and I haven't seen her for 4 or 5 months.And they dont want me to know! But somehow I managed to convince my sister to give me some info. I have noticed that she cannot breath properly once she walks or talks abit. Does any of you had this problem before? how bad is it?  When I read these posts  I felt that she needs to take medication or do chemo for rest of her life. is it true? or once it's over there is no need to continue?  And lastly anyone knows a good Dr that I could to if I manage to keep my hands on her medical results? I hope tomorrow morning when you wake up you dont have that damn thing in you. Thanks again ",

My Mom had a  cancer almost 18 years ago and she had a radical mastectomy(removed breast as well as the axillary lymph nodes) with chemo and possibly something else.Apperantly she was diagnosed when she spotted 3 lumps on her chest 1 months ago. As I heard cancer has speard to her lungs but I am not sure how advanced it is and no other signs. I think she is going to start chemo once her wounds heals abit from last week operation. I have mainly two questions 1- what is the future like for those who had/have this problem?(lung mets) 2- What do you expect your son or daughter to do to make you feel better? Thank you all.  Log in to post a reply",
