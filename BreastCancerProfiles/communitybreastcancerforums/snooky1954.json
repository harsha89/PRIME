A friend of mine has skin cancer and being a farmer this created a serious problem for him. He tried other remedies such as the marijuana cream which did not work. He also had some of them surgically removed. I told him about your story and gave him of your medicine but added that I had not read anywhere whether it helped for skin cancer. When I spoke to him in the previous week, he stated that there was a remarkable improvement. The large skin cancer on the top of his head felt dry and dead. I also telephoned my brother and told him about this product as well. He was sceptical to say the least. I then called my farmer friend and asked him to take a photo of his skin cancer and then take a follow up photo in a couple of weeks time so that I forward these to my brother. Mr farmer friend stated that I called him to late as all of his skin cancer is gone. The large one on top of his head had simply dropped off since we last spoke. This was after taking the product for only 3 weeks. Just thought I would let you know so that you can in turn let others know that it tackles skin cancer as well. Thanks and Kindest Regard  I took out all names for privacy.  Also, it does not mention what kind of skin cancer it was.  S",

Interesting that it says Fenben blocks cancer's use of sugar.  This sugar connection is hugh in the alternative med field.  One researcher, from the Phillipines (with a large number of credentials) claims that high glucose levels is the cause of cancer. Esp. in the USA, our intake of glucose, in all products has  skyrocketed enormously.   The researcher/PR actioner is currently helping his patients to keep sugar levels below 90 and is seeing great success.  Read your product lables high fructose corn syrup is in most foods.  Not to mention the obesity rate in the US. I'm realizing that it's not these folks fault. They eat but cannot feel full cause of empty calories from our food supply.

On another note:  Did I read on this site that taxol chemo and Fenben are related?   I'm trying to find the active ingredient in Fenben.  Is it too made from some form of the pine species? trying to make a connection: Taxol--from the Yew tree Turpentine--from the resin of the pine trees (I'm not taking about the turp brought at the hardware stores.) I live in a small town, and the country grocery store sells small bottle of Turpentine with the words \"for medicinal use\" printed on the label!!!!! Older folks, especially southerners, will tell you that their parents gave them turp on a bit of sugar one or twice a yr \"to clean their system\" (if you worked near animals, esp. in farming, you had worms, that's the way it was) Also, just had a Virgina friend tell me that her Mom would take a feather dip it In turp and rub it on her tonsils when she was getting a sore throat. Trying to figure if all meds from pine trees or similar species share this worming feature On Joe's fB page, they esp. state they are not trying to clear out worms.  The FenBen lowers sugar levels.    ",

It clears, from one area for a few months and then reappears. Meds from doctors do nothing. Finally, in 2018, I detoxed my entire intestines. I saw the fungal infection that had lodged itself in my colon/intestional tract, and after months, I thought that I was clean. Then 3 mos ago, I HAD to go on taxol chemo. (A second area of my breast developed cribform IDC in situ.  But the nodules started to grow out of my breast and decided to make a home on my skin.  ONC's insisted they would ulcerate and I agreed to 3cycles, (9infusions of taxol) and then back to hormonals. But during the chemo, fungus returned to my scalp, thrush returned, toe-nails, and now I'm finding it in my intestines again.   IS TAXOL WORKING BY KILLING FUNGUS? Because working it is: Recent scan this past Fri.----after 3 mos.   Several small nodules in lungs have dissipated.  Original tumor, which was found at 4.5CM but grew to 5.85 on Ful/IB is now  2.25CM(amazing)   The second breast tumor is also shrinking and the nodule growth on my breast has stopped maybe a small bit of shrinkage. The axillary lymph node also has shrink by half.   However, the 4 spots on my spine have grown slightly and now there is a couple more.... I find it odd that the tumors (full of fungus IMO) are shrinking but it's moving to other areas of my body.  But that's the nature of fungus.  When it's attacked it goes into hiding only to return later. My mind is mush right now.  I see my ONC  this Wednes.  and although I had agreed to 3 mos chemo and then onto something else.  I know that he's going to want to continue chemo.  Guess I'd be a fool not to give it a bit longer to finish shrinking the breast mass. Fungus also feeds on sugar.  Need to find out active ingredient in FenBen.   I rest of my supplies arrived today. Except for CBC oil which I would not add at this time.",

This means that the level (AUC=bioavailability) in blood could drop. By as much as 70-76% in the case of Everolimus. Same have been seen for Tamoxifen (posted earlier). So when supplementing with curcumin it seems wise to find out if other important drugs you are taking e.g. cancer drugs are metabolized by this enzyme - and in the case of this be cautious not overdoing the curcumin.\"\"   More: It enhances Letrozole to inhibit tumor growth! https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20038303/ ",

Jennifer-- Joe has a facebook group.  There are lots of positive responses to his treatment, although as Miao said it doesn't work for everyone.  Also, the B17 apricot seed protocol was based on a group of islanders who had little if any cancer. They found that this group of people ate apricot seeds regularly.

People actually cook with it, and that's more THC.   But to get the full benefit it needs to be boiled into a tincture.   Lol In case anyone is wondering. Besides what I have read, I know nothing about  MJ.  And although my user name suggests I'm a young kid, I'm 65.  But I have been researching MJ for last 2yrs.    Enjoy MIao",

Do you think there is a correlation?  Also, to change the subject slightly (or to enlarge upon it, lol)  I've read a lot about estrogens not produced by our bodies.  Plastic wrap, or plastic grocery bags, Tupperware type storage containers, all of these produce an estrogen like substance which our bodies cannot tell the difference from.  Read up on it It's very interesting.   Sue",

If only, I had that much money. It's very expensive.  God Bless",
