Everything went as expected until I spiked a fever (which prolonged my hospital stay). My prayers are with all of you. the surgery has left me feeling weak and extremely sore and two drains. The cami the hospital provided is a wonderful relief from the bandages and tape (I can actually breath again). Now I am playing the waiting game for the pathology report and this makes me very nervous.  I just wanted to wish all well and my prayers go to all.",
