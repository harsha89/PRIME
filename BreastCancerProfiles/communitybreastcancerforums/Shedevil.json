      "Content": "Shedevil wrote: so about 3 months ago both of my breasts started hurting (swelling, very tender/sore) out of nowhere for the first time since I started my birth control 2 years ago. Both were hurting about 5 days after my period until 2 days before every month. I thought I was pregnant for sure ( I also was getting acne for the first time since my bc and nausea) but took 4 pregnancy tests and went to the doctors to get one with all of them negative. About two weeks ago I realized if I wore a bra for the most part it didnt hurt that bad. As of yesterday my left breast started having shooting sharp pains right under my nipple. So I am really worried about what's wrong with me. And I'm hoping it's nothing serious but I'm scared. Log in to post a reply",
