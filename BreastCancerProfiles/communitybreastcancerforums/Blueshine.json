My husband, me and my kids had to start 3 times from Ziro, three different countries and different language. We worked hard and we did it. I am proud of my self, but without my dear husband would be a lot harder. And of course without God we would be nowhere. Now , dealing with breast cancer I rely completely on Gods mercy and get all my strength from him. I am proud of you, girls. Even each of you going through hard times you find love to give !",

I included CBD oil , / ordered from Randy / The oil has obviously good effect, sleeping, eating, less anxiety.. But I am not sure about vitamin E and curcumin. Vitamin E is antioxidant and it's not recommended for cancer patients, because the bad cell will benefit from the antioxidants first by feeding them, before the normal cell. Curcumin will decrease the effect of the hormon and target therapy. The results of the study with Fenben showed that it is not effective without supplements. Will be combination Fenben- CBD enough if I eliminate the both ? I was so excited when I started, but the more I read the more I am confused. The Care Oncology clinic in London are doing a trail of volunteers with different type cancers . They all are treated with mebendazol , metformin, doxycycline and statins. Basically the same what Jane was talking. They are documenting everything and we'll have clear picture of the results after a year or two",

The first post was from Photograph girl - pictures from her trip to Africa!!!! If you find something that you love, it would take your thought in a better place.

Mae, it's great decision to quit. At the beginning you will miss the people, but soon it will be ok. MicMel, could be hard and could be easy to sell the house, depending how you think. Your home is where you make it. Same bad, same pillow, same furniture and the best part is you and your Dh alone. I think you will be happier in your new home. Let the kids live their own life with their own problems, you did your job raising them. Now the time is for you. Hugs, love and prayers. Elena",

I am not very active here and if nobody is responding it's ok , I am grateful that I am part of this group, where I always can find support and love. MicMel, don't blame yourself, you welcome warm everybody. I don't know how you find time to keep with all the posts and deal with surgery, recovery and all the painful problems at home.

This is my first week full time babysitting for my dear grandson. He keeps me out of my dark thoughts, jast perfect.  MicMel, I read about your surgery and I fully support your decision. Don't be scared, everything will be ok. Very soon you will have two boobs and you are going to feel normal again like before. I didn't do it , because I was chicken . I sow the pictures and I think Your DD is resembling you,beautiful and happy. Keetmom stable results are what we want. I wish you to have stable for many, many years.

Try to have some sleep tonight, I wake up every morning 6 o'clock, so my prayers will be with you. We all will be praying and the power of prayers will be multiplied by as many as we are. Let God gaid the surgents hand and have successful surgery. DivineMrs it's nice to hear from you! Grannax, I'll pray for god results from the colonoscopy and you are going to be good for the next 5 years. Mae ,sorry the results are not all good, but at least they are 50 percent good. I am sure the doctor will figure out the medications . Once the tumor shrunk it will shrink again. This horrible cancer robbed our lives! Tanya, I like your pictures. Please keep posting from the sunny Florida. I can't wait for the green grass, colorful trees and blue sky. Minni31, hopefully you have less pain and be able to enjoy every precious day !

Your mom will understand your limits and only the fact that she is close to you will give her feeling of security. Try to think about how beautiful you will be in your dress for the wedding. I cannot wait to see pictures! Because I was behind with the reading I would like to add a comment to your post for your doughter. I agree with your suspicion why she changed. Jehova witnesses could influence her thinking. I know them very well in one point of my life. They tell you how to think, what is wrong and right, basically they have to fit in the frame and lose their unicness , their freedom. The relatives of her future husbent are trying to get her on their side, so she could convince her husband to go back to the religion. This is so wrong and I hope she'll be smart enough not to allow this. I'll wright later again, because I have to take my grandson to a doctor. Hugs and love to all. Elena",
