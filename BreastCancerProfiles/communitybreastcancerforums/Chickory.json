I cannot go anywhere else without paying out of pocket, which would not be affordable. I can change my insurance plan this October and start with a new plan by Jan 2015, which I plan on doing.  I was told I was getting a digital mammogram. I don't know if that means it was 3D? I never heard of that. Meanwhile I am doing what ever I can, eating better, getting more sleep, taking vitamin D. My Drs don't test vit D levels so I don't even know if I am low. I'm thinking about having it done with a kit through the mail for $65, but I am probably am low, I have an indoor job and wear 30x sunscreen because I have had skin cancer. I do most of my reading about breasts on this site and I just ordered Susan Love's breast book, hoping to learn more about b9 breast disease. BTW I am 57 and still having periods, never had kids. I think my body might be getting tired of estrogen.",

      "Content": "Chickory wrote: For the past 9 months I have been concerned about my breast. My last communication from my BS was \"we'll see you in 6 months\", but I don't feel great about that. I'll try to tell the story as brief as possible: Sept 2013 - thermogram showed heat and moderate risk in the right breast near the nipple. I wasn't aware of anything wrong other than itchiness in that nipple. Oct 2013 mammogram, then repeat pics of the right breast upper right area (they always retake that area), then u/s finds it to be a b9 cyst. A few weeks later: I see a dimple in the mirror, lower inner area of right breast.The gyn can't find a lump with manual test, says I wasted my money on the thermogram but refers me to a BS. Nov 2013 BS says cancer never occurs in the lower area, orders u/s. The u/s tech says she has seen cancer in every part of the breast and to ask for an MRI. She also u/s the nipple and dimple area on my request but there is nothing found. The BS offers an excisional biopsy of the dimple just to quell my fears about cancer. I tell the BS no I want to wait. Jan 2014 By now my right breast has a constant dull ache, I have pain in my shoulder blade, then one morning I have a painful area on my ribs on the outer lower area so tender that I can't wear my normal bra, I switch to sports bras that are barely tolerable. I email the BS and he offers the excisional biopsy of the dimple again, by then I have read a lot on this board and think that this dr is nuts to perform a biopsy where there is no lump. I ask for an MRI and am told no that it would most likely result in an unnecessary biopsy.  (REALLY??). I tell him no and wait some more. I saw the abc news video clip where a tumor in one spot pulls on the tissue to form a dimple in another spot. Looks just like my breast. I feel lumpiness but no lump. March \u2013 I go back to the gyn who gets angry that I have come back to him, he tells me I need to buy new bras if they hurt me, he tells me that was a very knowledgable BS, I said no he wasn\u2019t. April - New BS orders another mammogram and u/s and chest xray for the rib pain. She asks if I am interested in breast surgery to make my right breast the same size as the left. I say no, they used to be the same size, the right is swollen. Mam and u/s find nothing but the xray finds a fractured rib!  She says I probably fell and the impact of the fall also caused the dimple on the breast. The rib explains all the swelling and breast pain. We can do a recheck in 6 months. Mystery solved, case closed. But I did not fall, I have had no cough, I am not into any sports, I have not been drunk or abused. I have no idea what I did to break a rib. I see a chiropractor regularly but don\u2019t recall any rib pain with any adjustment.  I had the dimple 2 months before I had any rib pain, they are about 4 inches apart. The rib pain seems worse now. I can also see a slight new dimple in the area between the first one and the sore rib. I also just got a repeat therm. It now shows high risk to the nipple area and both dimples are visible. The dimples are not hot areas either. Sorry it is such a long post. I've been wanting to write here for months.

I finally got an MRI (after I sent a firm email to my doc) which resulted in an mri guided biopsy which found invasive ductal cancer. Got the call from the doc today. It was right where the thermogram said it was, the lower inside, where the BS said cancer never occurs. And it was not under the dimple where he offered to biopsy a year ago. The 3 mammograms and u/s I had since that then never found anything. So the answer to my question was no, I was not worrying too much. I was ignored, labeled a nut, swept under the rug. I am not in shock or upset, I feel emotionless. I wore myself out worrying a long time ago and resigned to hopelessness.. I've told a few friends who are in shock, because they didn't take me serious either. I really don't care, just glad to have the mystery solved. It feels hollow to say I told you so.",

The bs called me today and said I really upset the system, the rules they have to follow. She said because of me, Kaiser might have to change their rules! She wasn't supposed to let me have an MRI, and had to push for it. You have to have a positive mamo or u/s first, and they were surprised the mri found something. In my email to my bs requesting the MRI I told her I had consulted with a doctor outside of the Kaiser system and today she asked who it was. I saw Dr Christine Horner on TV in a debate with another surgeon about the pros and cons of mammograms. I went to her website and requested a 30 minute phone consultation. The information and courage i got from her led me to email my doctor. One thing I quoted in the email was, 20-30% of tumors will not show up on a mammo so matter how large the tumors get. And there are other types of U/S that show better images for dense breasts, 3D and elastography (Kaiser doesn't do). Dr. Horner said I should have had an MRI months ago due to my breast density. My dr told me she had a couple other patients with similar problems that might be able to get mri's now too. So wow, some good might come of all this. A few weeks ago, fresh out of the shower, while I was drying my hair, my cat planted his nose right on the hot spot on my breast and sniffed intently, the same spot the mri found my 1.3 cm cancer. I've seen him sniff at the warts on my dog too so I call him the tumor tracker now. I've read here of other people's pets who have done the same. I guess now that I have a diagnoses, I should move to another forum so this will be my last post here. ",
