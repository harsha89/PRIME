A few days ago, while I was on my period, I noticed that my right breast was very tender. I then noticed that there was a faint pink spot (like the size of a penny) right on top of my areola. It's been two days and the spot is still there although it is not as tender. That spot is still there today and if I touch it too much the areola( right under it) skin bunches up a bit. Other than that nothing else looks abnormal. I should also note that I have a very irregular period and I dont know if this is hormonal? I'm incredibly nervous and don't know what to do...
