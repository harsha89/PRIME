Ingerp, your chili sounds perfect, given our damp, dreary weather.  At least snow is now off the forecast for this weekend. At both the port placement site and the implant incision, I still had stitches that hadn't dissolved at 5 weeks.  I guess some of us must like to hold onto our sutures! It has been helpful reading how some of you are feeling emotionally.  With all my treatments and the reconstruction surgery over, I'm now having very similar emotions.  One of the MO's had said that many patients will feel as if they've been abandoned and \"what now\"?  With every minor ache or headache, my thoughts immediately jump to \"has the cancer spread\". As Frog said though, the feelings pass quickly.  ",

This surgery and recovery, so far, are so much easier than the BMX.  The good news is that I didn't have to come home with drains, as so many ladies do. It feels good to have the chemo port out too, though I am so glad that I had the port for all the blood draws and chemo infusions.  The pre-op surgical nurse couldn't get the IV placed and had to call in two more nurses to find a good vein.  As so many of you are winding down with your chemo treatments, I hope you all will have an easy time of the remaining chemo and start to feel like your getting back to \"normal\" again. ",

I recall there was a discussion a few days back about some of you being Triple Negative.  I am also Triple Negative, but I started out with DCIS, very weakly ER+ from the initial biopsies.  After the BMX, the full path report came back with IDC Stage 1A Triple Negative.  I consulted with 4 MOs and they said everything from NO chemo to AC-T.  Two told me that with the small size IDC tumor (4.5mm), they would only recommend 4 Taxotere/Cytoxan.  Majority ruled and that's what I decided on.  The Triple Negative group is very helpful and are quite knowledgeable about the current clinical trials and treatments. Thanks again for all your suggestions.  I will discuss all this with the MO tomorrow.  ",

Several years ago, my ENT suggested Ayre Saline Nasal gel and a saline nasal spray (I use Ocean brand, but there are multiple brands on the store shelf) to help with nosebleeds.  My primary care doc had told me to use an allergy nasal spray daily to get through allergy season, but that daily use caused the nasal passage to get way too dry with subsequent heavy nosebleeds. The ENT said to discontinue the allergy spray and stick with the saline. I'll be having #3 of four T/C on Thursday.  I've been using the saline nasal spray twice daily since chemo began.",

Come November, with the benefit signups, we will see what this new company offers.  I wish the best case for you and your wife.. Deb, I've been wearing a bra constantly since Jan 31. I'm 4 weeks post exchange now. At my appt with the PS last week, he said I still needed compression and to continue wearing a supportive sports bra. The compression is more for the fat grafting sites, not the implants.  He won't do any further grafting or revisions, if necessary, for another 6-12 months.  For me, the implants are so much more comfortable than the expanders, though I'm not sure about the final outcome, appearance-wise.  He said it takes time for everything to settle in and heal. I wasn't prepared for how long this recovery is taking, though.  So many of the women on the Implant Exchange discussion group talk about it being so easy. Maybe they didn't have fat grafting?

This April group has been such a support, both as I went through chemo and all these months after. What I've discovered during my hiatus is that I do rely on all of you for the unconditional support.  Others that haven't traveled this path just don't \"get it\", especially the rollercoaster of emotions. So much has happened with all of you.  I am so sorry for your loss, Linda.   Engine, I couldn't believe that given all Janice has been through, you two are now faced with this latest hurdle. I was relieved to read that the internist feels upbeat about Janice's recovery. I know all of you have had so many trials, ups and downs.  I hope Bryce is well on the road to being his old self, GAWarrior. Congrats to you, Urdrago on your new grandbaby!  I was also glad to see that you are still sending your own unique \"Happy Birthday\" greetings .  All of the pictures are great!  DebAL, I cold-capped and don't have much more hair than you.  Your hair is really growing in so fast.  Ingerp, I love the curls; you look beautiful, as do all of you!  Well, now that I've read through a month of posts and attempted to get caught up, I wish all of you a warm and uneventful afternoon.

The pictures of all of you are great!  Even though I cold-capped, I had to cut my thin, scraggly remaining hair so short that it's not much longer than some of yours. I've never had short hair before and the most startling aspect is how cold the back of my neck gets. Ingerp, my hair was straight and now it is chemocurls, or rather chemowaves. I'm just happy to have hair so I will let it do whatever it wants.  Engine, my mother-in-law always cooked turkey in a brown paper bag. Until I tried hers, which was very moist and flavorful, I thought all turkey was extremely dry; shall we say sawdust! Then the food police chimed in on the use of grocery bags for cooking.  My mother-in-law continued to use her brown bags, though. DebAL, what did you decide about further revision surgery?  I think the rippling is getting worse as my implants settle in more. I warned family that I still have chemo brainfog.  Word retrieval is still noticeable to me.  I'll be talking and just can't come up with the specific word that I wanted.  Luckily, I'm never at a loss for words so I can always find a substitute, but it is still annoying. Also, my hubby now describes me as being \"scatterbrained\", which I certainly never was before. Reading through all these posts, one of you spent Thanksgiving in Indiana. We're in the Indianapolis area, though we've only lived here about 18 months.  I'll have to read through these posts to get caught up on everyone. To all of you going through rads or waiting on test results, I wish you the best of outcomes. ",

MO did send it to CA for the mammaprint/blueprint test, but due to such low tumor volume, the lab couldn\u2019t complete the testing. I have stressed out more from trying to make this chemo decision than any of the other decisions. I have a 2nd opinion appt with another MO next week. I\u2019m hoping she will give some clarity and relate the chemo options to my specific situation. I had originally wanted to do immediate DIEP flap reconstruction. PS had a CT scan done prior to mastectomy and found a tumor on a kidney. I had to have a partial nephrectomy 3 weeks ago. Luckily, it was also early stage, pT1a. All the doctors say there is no relation between my breast cancer and this kidney cancer, just unfortunate, or fortunate coincidence. This is why my chemo decision has been delayed so long after the BMX, as the MO wanted to wait for the kidney path report and sufficient recovery. MO said 15% if no chemo; maybe 8.5% with AC-T; 9ish with TC; and 9.5% with CMF. I don\u2019t know if these are just generic statistics, or specific to my diagnosis and health.The only advice he will give is that I have to do what I\u2019m comfortable with.",
