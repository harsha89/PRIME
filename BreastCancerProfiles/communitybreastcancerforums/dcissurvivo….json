I wonder if I should ask my doctor next week about getting a bone scan? Thoughts?",

The lining of the abdomen and the surface of the ovary come from the same tissue when we develop from embryos in the womb. PPC is a cancer that starts in this tissue. I beat breast cancer but I have many other cancers in my family (stomach, pancreatic, hodgkins lymphoma, brain, eye, cervical) so I guess I am a tad paranoid.  I am going to request a CA125 blood test once a year.  This test checks the levels of protein called CA125.  Levels of this can be higher than normal of PPC is present.  Anyway, thanks for listening and responding.  Take care and have a great day.  Regards, Linda.",
