I don't wear a sports bra, no point, I'm still pretty flat, lumpy but flat.  My TEs aren't full yet to where it would be needed.  It is nice to just throw a shirt on! I went through bouts of depression, it's normal.  I would have your vitamin levels checked.  You have to ask I have found.  My Vit D levels were extremely low along with Vit B.  Those are important in your body recovering and your mental health.  I'm taking B12 shots now, what a difference it makes, and Vit D (50000iu a week).  Vit D was prescribed, I take one pill a week. It does take time. Don't rush yourself as hard as that may be.  We want to feel our normal selves again and as much as you may not want to get yet.  We will not be our normal selves for sometime, if ever.  We had a big part of our womanhood taken from us and unlike a man having a testicle removed ours is right out there for everyone to see. My suggestion is give in to something that makes you feel good.  Get your hair done, get a massage...there are tables with holes for your chest (you can even just have one on your back).  get your hands, legs and feet massaged. You so deserve it. Don't do things that will cause you to feel like crap. For me, it's still trying on clothes.  They don't fit right and look awful. I'll stick with jeans and tshirts for now. After I get my weight back off and have my exchange, I'll get back into the dressing rooms. I hope this helps you. :) Michelle",
