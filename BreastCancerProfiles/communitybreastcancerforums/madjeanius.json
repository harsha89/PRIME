Headshaving was a bit weird for me too as I was worried I might look scary to my four young grandchildren. I got them to do it and they laughed and really accepted it. I notice my seven year old granddaughter is very accepting of me being bald around the home but she is embarrassed if I take her to school bald. Losing hair was probably easier for me because my hair has always been fine and taken a lot of \"doing\" to look good. I got a really good wig though and its heaps better than my hair will every be. I love putting it on and its really simple - I'm glad to have an excuse to get a wig. People who don't know I have cancer and I haven't seen for a while have complimented me on how good my hair looks. Hope you've found your hair journey as good.",

Due to have six rounds, once every three weeks for eighteen weeks prior to double mastectomy/hysterectomy with ovary removal. I live in Queensland, Australia. Best wishes to anyone else starting out. I don't know what questions to ask yet and, as I'm new to all this. I just plan on taking things as they come and doing my best to get through treatment. I really suffered during my first round of chemo and had two hospital admissions due to severe chest pains (investigated for heart attack/clots, etc) and then headaches/rash/fever. Subsequently all symptoms were due to the chemo. I think anxiety was also involved so I had a sense of dread accompanying my physical pain. I'm through the second round and back in the sunshine ten days after which gives me another 11 days before next chemo - these days are so precious. Although I don't have an appetite, I'm alive and not in pain or nausea. Part of the reason I feel better this time I think is that I kept pain and nausea under control with regular medications and found occasional diazepam helpful when relaxation/attempting to be present just did not have an impact on that \"dreadful\" feeling. I've fortunate to have been able to stop work completely during my treatment so I'm taking the opportunity to reevaluate my approach to self/ life/work/relationships. My intention is to live whatever life I have going forward (hopefully a full life) fully grounded in reality and present with the people I care about and the activities I value. I really don't like suffering but chemo has given me practice definitely!!!!!! Good luck to everyone starting out in April. Kind regards, Jean",
