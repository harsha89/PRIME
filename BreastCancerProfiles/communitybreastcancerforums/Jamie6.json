Your story reminds me of why I get a little worried about hospitals sending us home so quickly after procedures such as ours.  I had my bilat-mx with TE on Monday, Feb 9, and post surgery I was running a fever of 100.7 as well as being very anemic (rbc count down to 6 where norm is around 12).  They still told me,  \"It's up to you if you want to stay another night\".  Not that I minded going home after one night, as I may have rested better at home, but there was no way I could monitor my anemia which seemed to be alarming the nurses, and I figured I'd be better off left at the hospital for observation and monitoring I could not do from home for myself.  Nothing at all like what you experrienced during your hospital stay, so I can't complain.  However, in my case, I have to say that the rating on the staff at my hospital was 50-50.  Some were great, and some were obviously just putting in their hours and didn't really want to be bothered - LOL. Doctors and nurses always seemed to have difference in opinions, and I was starting to get very confused listening to them separately.  I'm glad I'm home now, but I'm left with a lot of pills to keep track of on my own.  Large doses of iron pills (makes me constipated!), antibiotics, pain pills, and anti-nausea pills.  I must confess, the nausea wins out of all of them.  I can pretty much deal with the other discomforts, but with this constant nausea, it's been quite a miserrable week so far for me. I wish you all a very quick recovery  - one day at a time, as I am told :-).  Hang in there, and know that my prayers are with you all. xoxoxo Jamie6 ",

The day I got my drain tubes out completely after 2 weeks, I immediately hit the gym to resume my normal physical activities and exercises.  I did take it easy when it came to lifting or pushing heavy things, but other than that, I felt pretty terrific.  I only had 2 sentinal nodes taken out from each side, so I didn't have any problems with mobilities with my arms.  I've been using my 3 pound dumb bells each day to exercise it to make/keep them stronger post surgery, and now they are completely strong and feeling dandy fine! 4 weeks later is when they started to expand my brests with saline solution injections - and that is when the real discomfort started for me!  Surgery seemed like a breeze compared to my ongoing breast reconstruction at the moment - LOL. Having traveled extensively and frequently all my life, I can tell you that Germany is not a country where I would be afraid to travel to.  They are efficient, high tech, good medical facilities with easy access (and they speak English for the most part!). If you were traveling to remote countries or third world, I would advise against it (been there, done that, and it was a scary experience to be in one of their clinics when I came down with something after drinking their water... yikes).    Good luck.",
