    "Content": "Sep 5, 2008 02:10PM - edited Sep 5, 2008 02:11PM by tama I had a stereotactic biopsy and the radiologist cut a blood vessel.  I have had a lot of pain in my breast as well...burning, stabbing pain.  I am hoping this is not permanent.  I did develop a hematoma.  Any hope for the pain to go away?  It's been 3 weeks.",
