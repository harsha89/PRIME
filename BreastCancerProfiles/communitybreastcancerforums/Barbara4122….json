I know Dr Sabol, the breast surgeon, is very skilled and I love her personality. Dr Wu is not the touchy, feely, nuruturing type but I am looking for talent and skill here!  She is certainly pleasant enough and that's good enough. (ps-where did you put our feelers, patients or other docs?).",

I am still deciding if I want direct to implant or expanders as direct to implant is a little more limited in size avail.  Drs Salzberg and Ashikari are very well known and many women rave about them.  I was going to go for a consult but I didn't want to be that far from home and I would most likely have had to pay several thousand out of pocket.   What PS office did you meet these women at?  Did they have direct to implant w\\alloderm?

My surgery is prophylactic (BRCA1+) so I guess they are more comfortable doing nipple sparing. Good Luck!",

This nipple took beating and took longer to heal than the left. Of course it does not hurt but it seems a little bit redder since the last fill...I hope that is not cellulitis.  Wow, 150cc fills!!! I have been having 60cc's and I that is a little taxing. Good luck with your exchange surgery on Aug 17th.",
