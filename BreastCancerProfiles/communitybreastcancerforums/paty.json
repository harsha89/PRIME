My lumpectomy has left me with a deformed breast and i almost wish i went for the mastectomy. Maybe i wouldn't have the skin tumors there! It will be more of a mess if they decide to just remove the tumors.",

This Spring my cancer came back to my lymph nodes and there are a few red, raised areas on the breast/chest area where I had the radiation. Even with my new treatments, the areas seem to be getting bigger. My dr said it could be tumor. I am wondering if it came from the radiation and is not from the breast cancer. My dr doesn't want me to have a biopsy here because she said it may not heal well due to the skin having been irradiated. Â Has anyone heard of skin tumors from breast cancer?",

I was diagnosed with a recurrence in April and was already taken off a clinical trial because of mixed results. I think I am going to be thrown off a second trial because I have a skin tumor that is getting worse. I am trying very hard to remain positive but find myself feeling sorry for myself that nothing seems to be working. I don't feel sick and am having a hard time believing that I could actually die from this. My family and friends are great sources of strength for me but I dare not let my guard down and let them see me afraid. They always tell me how I'm a model of strength. Do they keep saying this so that I will actually believe this?",
