How long was your hair when it started to curl? Mine ins btwn 1/4 and 1/2 inch and poker straight. Kind of like Puffins at the top. Puffin, how many months PFC were you when you took these pics? Looks awesome. Best to all, Chrissy",

I have a question that I am hoping you can help me with. I am 3 months post last taxol trt. My hair is about 1/2 inch long. My scalp is now covered but it is as straight as an arrow. I have read on this thread that most of you have hair growth that is very curly. I am just wondering if my hair is still too short to be curly or if it will remain straight. Any thoughts on this matter would be greatly appreciated. If you had curly hair, when did it start to curl? Just curious. Also when did you start going without a wig and how did you wear it when it is so short?I still feel really awkward as it is soooo short. Again any feedback is welcome. Thanks. Chrissy",

I had a full head of hair but I just had one area near the top that was thinning a bit so went onto this product. When I was bald after my chemo I used a special product from the salon where I bought my wig. It was especially helpful for an irritated scalp (solution) and for hair regrowth. It is called Furterer RF80. The product comes from France. Now that I have a bit of hair I am back to my Nixon again. It is slightly medicated and I just find it soothing. And it is well known with hair stylists/salons to help ppl with thinning hair. Hope this helps. Let me know if you like it. Best. Chrissy",

I finished chemo aug 2014 and rads in nov 2014. I took effexor from mar 2015 to May 2015, not a long time but long enough to give it a try. I did not feel that it was working so have just recently weened off. Having said that, my knees and legs and back have been mega sore the last four days. My guess is that perhaps the effexor did work even if it was a wee bit. Question to the group....... Before I reassess whether to go back on this particular anti depressant (effexor), is anyone else using an anti depressant to help manage joint pain? And if so which one. And is it effective for you? I know that there are a couple of them that are used but looking for your personal experiences here. All comments are welcome. I have heard that cymbalta is particularly good for joint paint and osteoarthritic pain in the knees. Feedback anyone? Thank you for the previous posts about walking. I will try a little harder with this. I have a terrible pain in my left foot which has caused me to barely walk at all. I have orthotics but the pain in my bunion is horrible. I will persevere and thank you for giving me more strength to try this again. Let's hope that we all find something to make us more comfortable in all that we have to do every day. And let's hope that there is a solution in the not so far future Comfort and peace to all, with everything that you are suffering from. I just never knew what this journey would be like at the time of diagnosis. And when will it ever end.Chris",

I think it's just the new normal for now but pray that it improves with time. I am attending cancer exercise class twice per week and have found that it has helped a tad with my mobility but not with the pain. I also use an electric blanket each evening for a couple of hours. Again, it does not take away the pain but it is quite soothing. Give it a try. Hope40, I have also noted that my aches are worse with the cold weather. My bones crack and creak and I feel like I am 90. My knees and hips are exceptionally bad. I know exactly how you feel. When will his end is all I have to say. I thought once chemo and rads were done, I would be good to go. No such luck but as terrible as this may sound I am glad to hear that it is not just me and that it is not that unusual. But I do pray for all of us that this horrid discomfort will eventually subside. We have all been through enough. Love and best wishes to all. Chris",
