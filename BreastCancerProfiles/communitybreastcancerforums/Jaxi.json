It's seems pretty big, however I have been too freaked out to touch it. I have been pretty nervous ever since. Of course I did the worst thing ever...Googled! Ugh! So not a good idea!!! Finally, I found this site and after reading several posts...feel like I am in the right place. I have an appointment with the Hunstman Cancer Hospital's Breast Care Center on Tuesday. The wait has been such a struggle for me...time seems to be dragging and I find it so difficult to focus on anything. I am 45 years old with no history of breast cancer in my family, though my sister, mother and father (RIP) have had other types of cancer. I am trying to be very optimistic! Log in to post a reply",
