I'm starting rads tomorrow, after my appt today where they drew all over me with a sharpie, why don't they make up their minds, either use tats or a pen, but both is a mess!  I found my lump in early April, stage IIa, no node involvement, ER+, HER2-, finished chemo in early August (my onc just wouldn't do any more because I was becoming so sick, so didn't quite finish the full set), had a re-excision 3 weeks ago (yeah!  clean margins!).  I'll be reading to keep up with what to expect.  I had so much trouble finding a time that worked, I finally picked something toward the end of my work day, but I'm already looking at my calendar (next week my son will be home for his fall break from his first year of college...I want to spend time with him, not the rad techs).  Looks like I'll be done in early December, what a pain. -Kara",
