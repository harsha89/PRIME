I had an ooph @ age 47 done lapro.  It was an easy (for me anyway--compared to all the other surgeries) outpatient surgery.  I had it done on a Wednesday and was back to work on Monday.  For me, it was a choice I made because I WANTED to take an AI as studies have shown them to reduce recurrence more than Tamoxifen.  It does push you into menopause and some people have more issues with that than others.   I just really wanted to get rid of most of that nasty estrogen running around in my body. But...it must be your decision. Good luck to you! ",

You might want to check out the Breast Reconstruction forum.  There are more threads there about recon issues.  There is one titled Tram Flap that might be interesting to you.  Feel free to ask any questions.  I didn't have a bilateral, but some of the ladies posting in that thread did. Good luck to you!!! ",
