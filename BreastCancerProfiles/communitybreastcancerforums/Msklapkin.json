Same thing with an oncologist- some specialize in Liver cancer or Breast cancer. Oncology is a very big field- make sure you go to a specialist in your surgery and they do it often I also agree with the post that said most Breast Surgeons deal with Breast Cancer and should be able to answer all questions you may have. A surgeon who does breast \"augmentation\" is a Plastic Surgeon,not a Breast surgeon usually I hope this helps you.  Good Luck- If you tell us where you are, we can help you find docs in the area",

My belief is knowledge is power when it comes to fighting cancer and early detection is the best cure. Good luck with whatever you choose Susan",

I think what this means is if women are tested young and are positive, they can have more surveillance or make decisions about their breasts and ovaries earlier-for example- start Mammograms at 30 instead of 40. BC and OC have no age limitations- I know women in their 20's and women in their 80's  and everyone in between.  Each is a valuable life and should be monitored and treated to live a long happy life.  Just because we are over 50 we should not ignore the tools we have to save us. I think your questions are best answered by a doctor and I strongly suggest you see a genetic councellor.  It may be BRCA or a different mutation due to the cluster.  Only by more testing and more info can doctors do their research. Please know each case is individual-just because your Grandmother got it at 53 does not mean if you pass 53 you are safe.  Please test yourself and since you are at high risk, you should have additional testing- MRI, IU ultrasound, etc.  I wish you luck with whatever they find on your mammogram. Please understand I am a 2+ year survivor with the BRCA2 mutation.  I wish I had know and could have found my tumor earlier- before it spread to my sentinal node. Good luck susan",

Now- take one day at a time- try not to think about what if's etc- there is nothing you can do about that- try to live in the moment-that is the only certainty. Face each day with strength and pat youself on the back each night for all you accomplished that day. I am sorry we had to meet this way, but know so many of us have been where you are right now and have survived and prospered as people- you will get love and strength here and know- YOU WILL GET THRU THIS! You are in our prayers Good Luck Susan ",
