I work out a lot and try to limit my carbs which makes me more tired. I am always trying to get so much done.I work long hrs. If I go to a dr complaining of fatigue the answer would be simple. According to doctors, my cancer took 8 yrs to get to be 1cm. So I doubt that I would feel more fatigued just months before diagnosis. Mmmmm... Did pushing my body and working through the fatigue cause the cancer perhaps? Did the chicken come first, or the egg? One thing is sure, I'm sure the cancer added injury to insult. Lol. Food for thought",

Why do I feel worse??? everyone is cheering!! 90% that it won't come back! That's great! I'm petrified!! ...... I don't want to broach the 10% factor. What a tsunami of emotions!! Here I am, rid of the tumor( surgery) waiting again for next Fridays results for treatment plan..... It's been a roller coaster ride for my poor husband and I since I felt the small bump on April 24th. My dr schedules announcements of results on Fridays and so TGIF has a taken on a new meaning. Every week it's been a climax of anxiety to receive my results. I always pray for the best but a part of me fears the worst. Starting from biopsy results, then the full body scans,X-rays and ultrasounds to check for spreading, then the surgery, then the results of surgery and nodes, then the tumor board. All this in 10 weeks. How do people stay \" normal\" through all if this? Perspectives shift so quickly. It's cruel!! The good thing is I've learned so much about myself and my husband. I really really laugh and cry so so hard! My family despite their occasional differences, have rallied around me to form an army of love and support. For these, I am so very grateful. And I have found this wonderful forum of such strong, caring and courageous women. What a blessing. I always want more:( So now I wait. Again... Next Friday the Onco Dx results will be in. So scared that it will score high. That would mean chemo. More scared to score in the middle 18-23. Then the chemo might bring it to 93% . Then I will have to make a choice. Do I choose the chemo for the 2%??? When you are in the worst case scenario or it is very aggressive, they just blast it with chemo, no thinking, just action! I feel guilty. Am I that shallow? I am grateful to have been spared so much. I thank God daily even hourly for blessing me with all that I have. I still feel so sad. I didn't sleep. I don't want to tell my husband how I feel. He is trying so hard to make me happy. I smile for him and my family... sometimes I start bawling because I am just so grateful that I discovered it by fluke and its out. 1 more week. I think once I know what's going on, no matter what, I will feel relief. I think.... Help.....

I am a fitness champion, trainer and nutrition consultant. People come to me for professional advice and I am considered a top expert in my city. I was diagnosed with BC last month.... Need I say more? I am 44yrs old. Don't drink, don't smoke, workout 4-5 times a week, eat tons of vegetables and fruit, fish and eggs. Always have.... Blah blah.... I know people who abuse drugs and alcohol and smoke packs for years. They don't have cancer. So then... Why me? My answer... Why not me? It's a test that I will pass!! I am blessed to have found it early and have wonderful support from my husband, family, friends and this amazing forum. When I think back, yes... I definitely could have done things even better along my life journey, we all could have... But where do we draw the line? I received an email today from a friend saying that lipstick causes cancer. I mean....when can we just live like we did as children? Your friend needs to be fair to herself and be prepared to fight. Remind her that Cancer is treatable and many many go on to live longer than those not diagnosed. Once you pass the 5yr-10yr mark, it's like starting over. As scary as it is, your friend can try to use the fight of this disease to motivate her to change and day by day small changes add up and with those changes, her esteem will boost and she will love herself more and more. In the meantime, remind her how much you love her. That alone is a big start. Keep reminding her. You are a great friend. Wishing you and her the best....btw... She should seek professional council.",
