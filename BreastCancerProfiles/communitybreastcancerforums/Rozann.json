I don't really know when mine went to Stage IV, since I had no symptoms and my onc never checked. I found it because of a kidney infection that landed me in the hospital and my GP found it. I tried the femora and it didn't work, now I am on faslodex. I now have mets to my lungs, liver and just found about bone mets in my ribs. Supposedly, I have a fractured rib, however, I don't feel it at all. What kind of pain do some of you have. My arthritis hurts more than the cancer (knock on wood)? Does the fact that I had cancer in 2008 have any bearing on if I need it again? I pray for us all. I love this site and all of you people.",

It seems that the 2nd and 3rd and sometimes the 4th day after chemo are the worse, then it starts to get better. I have tried many different chemo meds, since the metastasis in 2012, but none of them seem to work very well.",

Southernsur, I go to Roswell Cancer Institute in Buffalo and they told me that there is no need to drink that stuff anymore. I haven't had it in awhile. It makes it so much easier. Most of the pain I am having is from my bones (I think). I have 3 broken ribs. My liver, lungs and bones are involved in my cancer. I had a compressed fracture in one of the vertebrae in my back and had to have cement put in. I was first diagnosed with cancer in 2008 and it spread sometime in 2012. I guess I should consider myself lucky. My prayers are with all of you.",
