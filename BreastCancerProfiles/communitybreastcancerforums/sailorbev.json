The surgeon I saw yesterday does not do it and would have to refer me 2 hours away for IORT. I don't want to bother with the consultation if it isn't covered by insurance and my insurance company can't tell me without the billing code. I feel like I am in a Catch-22.

While the results of this study are very encouraging, more research is needed before doctors can say for certain if some older women diagnosed with luminal A breast cancer can avoid radiation therapy.\" Even though the study says more research is needed I think I will discuss this with my surgeon. I fit the profile in the study, I am 61, stage 1, grade 1, ER positive 100%, PR positive 10%, HER2 negative, Ki-67 <10%. Has anyone else done this or considered it",
