      "Content": "terri-c wrote: Hi all, I would like to talk about SE's, and I don't want to limit it to just \"my\" treatment, because I would like to hopefully find people with a similar situation, and am curious how they handled it. I have been on Faslodex/Xgeva combo since June 2014. I was relatively fine at first, minimal side effects. Went to Disney this time last year, had no issues. Since around March/April I have noticed a marked increase in side effect pain after treatment. I'm not talking about just the injection site, but to be honest, my rear is permanently sore now. The fatigue is pretty hefty, and the bone/joint/muscle pain has gotten really bad. When the pain started, I was given pain meds, but I don't like to take them: I don't like the way they make me feel, and I still need to work. If I take them at night, I'm very groggy and foggy in the morning and I'm still hurting when I wake up, I just sleep through it I guess. When I wake in the morning, I can barely walk for the first 10-15 minutes. My legs, knees, ankles and feet are very painful in the morning. The pain subsides, but it doesn't go away. My onco says it is arthralgia. When this ride started in Feb 2014, I had only a \"pinched nerve type pain\" in one spot in my back. Now I have pain in my whole back, all my joints, legs, and today, my right arm (treatment was last week). I have treatment every 4 weeks, and at this point in time it is taking about 3 weeks to \"fully\" recover after treatment (by that I mean, pain is tolerable enough that i can ignore it) and then I spend that last week just tired and dealing with getting un-constipated. Have you ever changed or stopped treatment because the side effects became unbearable? Advice and personal experiences are so very welcome. I know I don't post a lot, and I'm sorry. I never know what to say, but I read everything.

The only palliative care docs within 50 miles of me are at the local hospitals and they are in-patient only (which completely blew my mind). I have an appointment with onco on the 30th, and plan to discuss how bad the side effects have become. It's difficult being the weird one. My cancer isn't what they normally see, it has traveled all through my blood, not in my nodes at all, my bone mets are blastic not lytic, I have trouble with meds, I have a very high tolerance for pain - fractured my leg when I was 5, didn't know till the next day, I just kept on trucking. My tumor markers have ALWAYS been in the normal range. On top of all that, my blood work is so wonky they don't know what is normal for me. Motrin doesn't work anymore, the pain meds don't really work, they just make me go to sleep. I feel better when I work, but I am exhausted when I get home. I hope we can figure out something to lessen the pain. Thanks all for the comments, I appreciate them all.",

I have applied for the ADB for one of my insurance policies that will pay off all of our debt, including the house, and we will only have utilities and insurance left to pay. The first application was denied because my oncology office did not complete the paperwork correctly (they put the statistical life expectancy in the \"how much time is left\" box), so last week after treatment, I sat down with a PA and we completely updated my records with all of my symptoms and they are submitting that to the insurance company with an amended form explaining the error. Hopefully it will go through, as without this, I am not comfortable leaving my job if the house is not paid off. My husband has a good job, but things will be tight if we still have the mortgage, and I would rather have that money going into savings. My plan is to go out on short-term disability, then transition to long term disability. I have discussed this already with my boss, and his bosses, and we have obtained approval to double fill my position in order to allow me to train my replacement. As soon as I receive the approval on the ADB, we will begin the hiring process for my replacement, I will train them, and then I will start the short term disability. STD will run for 6 months. Once I make the transition to long term disability, I will have to apply for SSDI, and once approved I will apply for Medicaid. In the interim, I will have to continue to pay for my health insurance. It currently costs $100 month (I'm a state employee) and that will last throughout the short term disability, but even with the health insurance credit, it will rise to $460 month while my income will drop to 60% on long term disability. There will be enough funding from the ADB to cover the health insurance payments until I get Medicaid. I never thought I would be \"retired\" at age 50, and it still feels kinda weird knowing the gears have been set in motion for this to happen. I am looking forward to making this transition. Mostly I look forward to not being so tired at the end of the day that I can keep my house clean and cook more regularly. My husband currently works 6 days per week, once the house is paid off, he will drop to a 5 day work-week and I am thrilled at the idea of having actual weekends with him. Our boys are grown, but we have 2 furry children who love having me home, so the time with them, that includes the energy to walk them and play with them, is a huge bonus also.",

My TM's don't tell us anything, and I haven't had scans since early October, so this will be at about the 6 month mark since the last scans. At first I thought it was a compensation thing, except I don't have a limp on the left hip unless I am having pain, and I haven't had pain in the left hip since December. I keep a calendar of when I take the prescription pain meds and what for (hip, back or head) - it helps me let the onco know when the pain was worse since I only see him every 3 months. The left hip was biopsied 2 years ago, and the biopsy took most of the tumor out, which is why the pain is only sporadic in that hip. I've not convinced myself it is progression, but some of the people around me are concerned it might be, because it is a weight bearing pain (mostly only hurts when I stand/walk, with occasional twinges when I sit too long on that side). I can't remember what it was like to have an energy level above always tired, but I have noticed I'm crabbier than normal lately :)",

They were 7mm, 10mm and 20mm, and one had a blood vessel in it. They've been removed and sent to pathology, but I've been doing some research today, and it turns out that though it isn't common for MBC to spread to the colon, it does happen.

I'm in treatment to live as long as possible. I'm in a support group where people I care about die, and I grieve them. Why would anyone think its ok to nonchalantly tell me about people who died of cancer, and think that I want to hear that??? Can they not see that it is depressing? I hate the color pink, and I hate the cliche gifts. My family and friends know not to give me those things. The things I have been given in the past are boxed up. I do not need any reminders. I have found that I have a lot of tolerance for other people's drama because it gives me something to laugh about and focus on so I don't worry about me. BUT, when I'm \"recovering\" from treatment, and my a$$ is sore, and my head hurts, etc....don't call me, I'll call you. I don't answer the phone, ignore everyone on facebook, and generally have no tolerance for anyone else's \"problems\" because my own problems are at the forefront and I just can't deal with nonsense when I'm hurting.",
