Hoping the side effects are kind to me. I have 2 boys, age 5 and 8 and we home school. I read all the posts and will get my chemo bag ready tonight. I have the teaching session, all kinds of other appointments so it will be a long day. Hoping to get the Christmas tree up tonight and enjoy the evening. I am grateful to find this board for support.",
