Stagefree: I have actually had very few side effects and have been tolerating chemo very well, by my account and by my doctors. Some mild neuropathy, general body pain, and very slight nausea only in the last month or so.  So that's why I am not completely buying the need for a break. But I hear you -- who knows what the chemo is really doing to all my insides?!? I can tell you I haven't had this much 'brain clarity' for months...

I have an ultrasound in 4 weeks and an apt w onc in 5.  I will ask him more details then.  However I may not need to wait that long as I am having some progessively worsening upper right abdominal pain and am waiting on a call back from the nurses to see if I should head to hospital or not. Thanks again all, and Happy Canada Day long weekend to all the Canucks out there :)",

I've had slight shrinkage of my tumours on Taxol (e.g. CT shows one of the moderate sized ones shrunk from 5.3 x 5.0 to 4.5 x 4.3 from March 2013 to June 2013). After reviewing this info with my oncologist this week, his recommendation is to stop chemo in favour of quality of life.  He said the tumours will grow and get worse in the future and they want to keep this chemo (Taxol) in their back pocket to use it when they really need to.  What the heck does that mean???? I pretty much had a breakdown in his office -- to me this felt like I was such a lost cause that they should just let me live a bit without dealing with the chemo side effects before I go completely downhill.  Future monitoring was suggested to be `how I was feeling`and blood tests.  I felt that was inadequate since I had complained to my GP several times in 2012 about pain before finally taking myself to emergency in October and my blood tests have been completely normal.   I was able to convince them to give me ultrasounds to monitor tumour growth. No one has ever mentioned any sort of life expectancy or given any indication of just how bad my situation is (other than my first appointment where I was told sagely \"it's not good\").  While I was told at this latest appointment that I should take this as good news, I am having a hard time understanding why they are doing this. thanks for reading and if you have any insight or experience with this, I would love to hear it.

It turns out that my tumours have grown, multiplied, and at least one is necrotic when comparing the CT done last Friday vs. one done yesterday (one week!!). This clearly isn't good, but I guess I'll be back on treatment ASAP!! Darn holiday weekend; I have to wait until Tuesday...",

I have large tumours in my liver (e.g. 7cm, 5cm, 4cm, plus multiple diffuse tumours throughout) and have been through 2 chemos and am now on my third this time around.  Buggers have shrunk, and seem to be managed for now and haven't escaped to any other sites (yay!). I consider myself lucky that I don't have many side effects.  I seem to be prone to numbness in my hands and feet as the worst of it, and some taste changes (spicy food is pretty much off limits - burns!).  I do still have pain in my overly-ample liver -- which was what originally caused me to go to the emergency room.  Thought it was a gall bladder attack.  This is managed for the most part by twice daily OxyNeo (oxycodone). I do think 'being in treatment' and having a plan does make you feel somewhat more in control of your life.  And by treatments and having a plan, that doesn't necessarily mean medically - plan vacations in the future, massages, outings with friends.  And don't look at statistics.  Those will do nothing but scare you into thinking YOU are a statistic.  You aren't - no one really knows what the future holds.  And statistics are old - things change all the time and those stats are based on the past.  We are in the present, and who knows what the stats will say about us? I was told from the get-go that I would be lucky to live a year.  Well, suck it, I say.  Surpassed a year this October and I have no plans on going anywhere.  ((Hugs)) to you :)  DancingVeggie: I have a difficult time sleeping on my right side due to pain in my liver, right breast, and where my port is.  I was told it is common for the chemo to cause pain in the breast that was the original site of the BC. I don't know if I could say my vena cava is being compressed, but I do feel pressure sometimes where the port threads into my subclavian vein - another reason to avoid sleeping on that side.  And my entire right arm falls asleep quite quickly - I am sure that can't be good for me!",
