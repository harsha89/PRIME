Weird thing is that the month long cycle lasted several months. Actual period part just a few days, but it sure was nice to be free of the hot flashes. Who knew how important hormones were to how you feel.",

My eyebrows and lashes we're much finer and lighter after chemo, even 2 years out. I found a cosmetic tattoo artist. She did my eyeliner so my lashes look thicker and my brows. I got sick of penciling them in. You have to find someone who specializes in permanent makeup. It really is an art. But my brows really look natural! Should have done it years ago. It's pricey, $850 for each- liner and brows but only one time. Thought I would shareüòç",

That way the surgeon can put the needle in while you are under anesthesia. You go home and sleep with the needle in and a big bandage over it. That way the next day when you go in for your first chemo, they don't have to access it, if you will. They don't have to push the needle in as it's already in. All they have to do is give you the treatment and then take it out. Then you have 3 weeks (or I did) to have it heal before the next time you take a treatment. It worked for me. Good Luck! Shannon",
