To:reflect......I assumed that this recent needle core with U/S biopsy went well because the radiologist was so sure of himself that he was able to obtain some cyst tissue.... especially with ultrasound assistance. However, since meeting with my gynecologist last week about the pathology report, I am doubtful that the radiologist got the right tissue. The report said that the biopsy tissue was \"non-diagnostic\" which indicates to me that the radiologist missed the actual spot he wanted to reach. The biopsy tissue resembled regular breast tissue. I do not have a copy of the report, but my gynecologist read parts to me. All I can determine, at this time, is that the recent April ultrasound \"visually\" tells them that there is a suspicious cyst there, but the core needle biopsy with U/S was benign because the radiologist must have missed the spot. In the pathology addendum, the pathologist recommended to have another core needle biopsy. My gynecologist recommended it too. So that is where It all stands right now, until Thursday. I obviously met the radiologist, and I have spoken with my doctor, but I have no clue who this pathologist is. So, I have to let the \" addendum\" speak for itself, i.e., the tissue was non-diagnostic. This whole situation is very confusing and distressing because no one can give me a definitive answer....yet. Regular mammograms, ultrasounds, biopsy, and all the waiting.....and still no answers. I wonder how frequently \"missing the cyst\" occurs during core needle biopsy with U/S? Thank you for your input. I read every word over and over again. I appreciate your insight and your personal journeys. I can only hope that my result will be benign again in upcoming 2nd biopsy...I must stay positive. I have read that 80% of biopsies are benign, and that keeps me going. Many, many thanks.",

      "Content": "Ton-Amie wrote: What a wonderful website to share information about such a worrisome topic. In October 2015 at annual mammogram, I was told that an ultrasound should be done that day. An ultrasound showed a small 4 mm round/almost oval-shaped, suspicious spot on the underside of right breast. It was pointed out to me that it had clear edges. The radiologist said it was a subaceous cyst, but that I should return in 6 months for another ultrasound...just to keep an eye on it. I returned in April 2016 for the 2nd ultrasound. The cyst size had increased to 5 mm and the edges were somewhat \"fuzzy\" said the radiologist. The radiologist recommended a core needle biopsy with ultrasound at that time so it was performed immediately at that visit. The radiologist seemed particularly pleased with the biopsy procedure. I liked his confidence that the biopsy went well. Three days later, the results came back benign BUT a pathologist felt that the tissue was not consistent with cyst tissue so he added an addendum to the report. Evidently, the radiologist who performed the biopsy might have missed the cyst. So it was recommended that I go to a special Breast Cancer Center for more tests and specifically a second biopsy. My appointment is this Thursday. Needless to say that I was relieved to have a benign result on the initial biopsy; however, that said, I am very unsettled about the possibility of a malignant result with this 2nd testing at the Breast Cancer Center. So I am focusing on staying positive as much as possible. That is, if first biopsy was benign, then second one will hopefully be benign too. Has anyone had this situation happen to them? Do benign cysts/lesions have rough edges too? Are there often inconsistencies between pathology reports and biopsies? Are addendums often/rarely added to pathology reports? What should I expect at this 2nd testing appt.? What questions should I ask at that time? What is the probability that the cyst is truly benign? Or malignant? Maybe I am asking questions that no one can answer, but those questions are running through my mind constantly. I am 63, very good health, active, and still teaching. One regret that I have is that I did not go to a Breast Cancer Center back in October, but the subaceous cyst diagnosis led me to believe that I was not looking at breast cancer. There was no recommendation by anyone in October to pursue an aggressive approach with a \"subaceous cyst\".....just come back in April for another look. I wish I had personally taken the initiative to move faster on this....a lesson learned. Anxious for Thursday. Carolyn Ton-Amie Log in to post a reply",

Today's appointment with Komen radiologist made me feel better just to finally get there. However, ultrasound showed that the mass has actually grown a bit more since first biopsy on April 26. It is still round-ish, and the border appears defined. The radiologist said that there is some blood flow to the mass. Not exactly sure what that means. At this point, radiologist is not ruling anything in or out. So more waiting.",
