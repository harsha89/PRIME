I had a Bilat Mastectomy 7 years ago with node removal when I was 27, I had immediate recon with expanders then radiation. However the radiation caused tissue damage and many many infections leading to the loss of  three implants and ultimately a Latimus flap a year later on radiation side, another ex pander then finally a Silicone \"Gummy Bear\" implant. 2 months ago I noticed in my armpit that has had no feeling for 7 years suddenly has pain, burning pain, I looked in the mirror and I had a red \"hole\" I went to GP and when he looked at it is caused searing nerve pain to the point I jumped and yelled. And I am pretty tough when it comes to pain. He gave me antibiotics and sent me home. I still have the hole and it is expanding, he doesn't seem to worried however the pain is getting worse. I still have no feeling when I touch the skin, but the pain is radiating and goes down my arm in a burning  way. The worst time has been at night I have to lay on opposite side with arm elevated above head to relieve the pain. The last two days it has started to bother me during the day as well.... Has anyone had anything like this? I am very concerned and in constant pain :(    Michelle ",

It has been so long since I saw my PS that I am waiting to get referral..... and I have moved away from the area so now waiting for a call from new oncologist....  I hate having the fear of \"what it is\" I am sure they will figure it out in time just frustrating, and I remembered how helpful these boards were when going through dx and treatment :) ",

It has been a bad couple of months severe migraines- which were actually sinus infection that wont go away, this stupid armpit pain ugggggg. I was starting to think maybe it was silicone leaking or something  (even though I know rare with a cohesive gel implant. Which of your doctors was the one to figure this out.... I find I go to one they say not my dept talk to another and so on and so on.... Like no one wants to take it on   :(  Hmmm maybe I will get massage from hubby :)",

Many infections and then we finally did the Dorsi Lat Flap and thought I was free of complications.  With all this pain I have been extra paying attention to changes and have noticed a large lymph node on same rad side, sitting just above my collar bone. When I run my hand down I can actually pull it over the collar bone. I am freaked out that this could be cancer again..... How did you discover a recurrence... Has anyone had a Lymph node like this?   Very scared.......",
