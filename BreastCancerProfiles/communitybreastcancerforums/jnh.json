Just had scans that showed NED. My tumor markers are finally stable and going down a little! I am a full-time special education teacher with a very physical job. I am also the mother of 2 very active teenage boys who both play sports. I have been able to continue all my normal activities including taking kids to sports activities, walking, and jogging. Now, some days are harder than others and I do have some fatigue. My drug of choice is caffeine. :0) I know side effects vary so much from person to person, but I think working is VERY possible! My main side effects are migraines and mouth sores. The mouth sores were the worst right at the beginning. Both have gotten fewer and milder with time. Oral prednisone with an on and off again schedule helped the most with the mouth sores-I should have started that right away. After the first few months, the mouth sores got SO much better-now I rarely take the steroids. The medication Imitrex has been a miracle drug for the migraines! I even discovered that 1/2 tablet would do the trick most of the time and so my prescription would go further for me! I also get some body aches but they are very tolerable. After about a year, I did have trouble with high blood pressure and high resting heart rate. Cardiologist said the treatment can do that. I did have to go on a small dose of a beta blocker which also makes me tired. But it took care of the problem and I'm still on the A/A combo plus Faslodex! Good luck! I hope it works for you!

Best news of all, scans confirmed what tumor markers showed, treatment shrunk the lesions in my liver by 1/3-1/2 their sizes! Yahoo! Had a treatment Monday, walked 3 times this week and didn't miss any days of work! Thank you, Julie",

My numbers have on several occasions gone up and then gone back down (for unknown reasons). The longer I do this, (3 years at Stage IV), the more I learn is that the numbers don't necessarily mean something is going on. Thinking of you! Wishing you well and hoping for low numbers next time.
