And lumpectomy is on the table as the previous surgeon was leaning that direction when I transferred care. Thus the second opinion. I am super hopeful that I indeed won the biopsy lottery! I have my second set of scans on Wednesday. Is it common to not talk with the radiologist? I never met the previous one?",

The dr said that it's a confusing name bc it's not really a scar but it looks just like what a scar would look like. Apparently it also looks like cancer on a mammogram ðŸ™ˆ Hope you find a dr you trust! That will make a big difference!!",

I know it fools radiologists on mammograms, I'm assuming it won't fool the mri tech? Also, I've read that radial scars don't cause skin retraction... But that's what started this whole thing. Do you guys know if those can be associated? I really like my new surgeon. She took time to answer my questions and was very personable. I'm so thankful to be in the 80% benign group instead of the 5%!!! Log in to post a reply",
