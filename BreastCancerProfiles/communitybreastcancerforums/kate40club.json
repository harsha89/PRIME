On may 23rd I had a Lumpectomy and lymph node biopsy in my left breast.My cancer was 8mm grade 2.Only 2 days ago I had my post op results the 2 weeks leading up to this were my darkest days ever..the waiting is so traumatic. My results were good news and my lymph nodes were clear.I havent stopped crying since and I now have 2 weeks to wait to start radiotherapy. My feelings are very mixed I still feel scared of the not knowing how its all going to go.I have a great positive lot behind and feel I have too much to live for so staying positive is the only way.To think just in 1 month from diagnosis this has all happened so quickly...would be nice to hear from anyone else who is at my stage.
