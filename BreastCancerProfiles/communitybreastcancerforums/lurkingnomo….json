I was limping around for months but my MO and I thought I was just getting older and was doing this weight training program called body pump.  My MO didn't think my aches and pains were cancer related, as I had the most aggressive treatment when I was first diagnosed.  Lumpectomy, AC and T, radiation and hormonals.   When we finally did the scan I lit up like a Christmas tree.  Part of my pelvis area was chewed away.  I was to start treatment soon with radiation but before that started I fell slightly and broke my pelvis.  I was out of commission for quite some time. So, LSpelling, I know how you feel!  However,  about a year and a half later, I feel pretty normal most of the time.  But, you have to be patient, as the radiation does help a lot, but it takes time. Thanks again everyone! Lisa",

Thanks for the additional feedback Ebru , Raro and Caryn.  I will be honest with my MO and let him know my concerns.  He hasn't even really said that I have mets in the other places than my bones. And, if he tries to pussy foot around again I will seek another MO.  I appreciate the referral, Caryn.  I really don't want to start all over at a different place. Ebru, my husband I are are thinking of taking a trip (hopefully!!) this fall while I can.  We were thinking of going to Italy, but I have followed your great pictures for some time.  I think that Turkey would be different and much more interesting.  What do you think?  I have a hard time walking too far, but can usually go a mile or so without my hip hurting.   All the best to all~ Lisa",
