My doctor wants me to watch it for the next month to see if it changes with my cycle. She isn't concerned because she can't feel the border all the way around. I feel like I can, but maybe I'm not feeling what I think I'm feeling. So, is not being able to find a defined border a reason to not do any further investigation? Log in to post a reply",
