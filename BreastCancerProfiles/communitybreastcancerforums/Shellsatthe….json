I would bring a notebook with question that you already have written, so you don't forget them. Ask away anything about your tumor. They should be able to give you the grade, an approximate stage (this can change once they do surgery and they see the full picture) and your receptor status. This means if you are ER+ or negative. You will also want to ask if you are Her2 positive or negative. This test can take longer to come back with results. All this stuff is important because it will help you and the Team to decide appropriate treatment plans based on these factors. Remember you are a part of this team and not just a spectator. You have a right to voice your concerns and desires. I wish you luck on your next appt.",

The two oldest are sons and youngest is my daughter. I was dreading the fact I would need to tell them after hiding it until I found out all the information I needed. My oldest has bipolar so I was nervous that this news could have a negative impact on his mental health. My daughter (youngest) too struggles with pre-teen mean girl stuff and was feeling lonely after her best friend stopped talking to her. I ordered T-shirts that said Team (last name). Then I had them open the boxes and made it into a conversation how we would team together to get through this. My oldest burst out into tears and panic, my youngest started to cry and my middle looked like a deer in the headlights. I then asked if they had questions and I was fine. I made sure to reassure them I wasn't going to die with a time line. I educated them that the kind of cancer I had (BC) offered treatments, so I could get on with living. They've been fine ever since. I try to keep the communication lines open as much as possible. I try to keep the information I give them simple so they can understand it.",

They both had different ones. I ended up going with the surgeon from Dana Farber who wanted to do the chemo first to shrink down the tumors and cancer in my lymph nodes so she could have the best chance of getting clear margins. My scans had showed my cancer had spread extensively on my left side. The plan worked and the cancer shrunk enough where she removed all the cancer and got clear margins! Because of the extent of my cancer, I had a mastectomy with radiation afterwards, that way any stray cells left over would be zapped.",

Many hospitals have newer machines that are tailored to only hit the area needed to radiate. I had cancer on my left side. That concerned me because of the location of my heart. The equipment being used would not hit the heart area. I had no SE from radiation.",

Smith Center for Women's Cancers at Dana-Farber. \"However, medical evidence supports that this is unlikely, as most cancer cells that get displaced into the surrounding environment will likely be cleared by the surrounding immune cells.\" In fact, a study of more than 2,000 patients carried out by Mayo Clinic scientists dispelled the myth that cancer biopsies cause disease to spread. The researchers showed that patients who have biopsy procedures to confirm their diagnosis and determine the cancer's stage had a better outcome and longer survival than patients who did not have a biopsy. http://blog.dana-farber.org/insight/2017/05/can-a-...

I had one that came to help with drains and changing bandages etc....Drains are usually in for 4 to 6 weeks and will need to be tended to three times a day. Not really something a friend or neighbor should do. Secondly, this is such a personal decision. Some people would love the company and/or extra help of someone to help with cleaning or cooking. Others find this more exhausting and prefer to have complete privacy. You also have the in between. Ask you wife how she feels about someone being with her and how often.  Hope this helps.",

If I was a double A, I wouldn't even bother with a bra. Since I am larger cup now, I do wear a bra with a silicone boob. I don't really notice it much. At times, I have a freak out moment at work and quickly look down to make sure I remembered to put the silicone on. Haven't forgotten yet. It hasn't changed the quality of my life. I can't wear anything low cut due to radiation that discolored my fair skin. It looks the color of a bad bruise. I remember a shirt I had on started to creep down just a bit and people kept looking away. It did look bad/scary. That probably has effected my self image more than losing my boob.",

I am having my left breast done, but don't need to hold my breath. As far as lotions/creams, I use Eucerin after I take my shower in the morning. My treatments are first thing in the morning at 8:00am. At first I was really sad about that availability. I had hoped I could have the late afternoon. I started treatments Oct. 17th. I haven't felt fatigue until this Friday. I chalked it up to major carb crash. I usually have protein only in the morning. Friday I had a day off and had a pancake breakfast. After I finished I had never felt so tired in my life. I just went straight to bed and slept for 4 hours. No more carbs for me in the morning. I will see if this makes the difference on Monday. As far as lymphademia, I do have some swelling which my Lymph specialist said is expected. I see her once a week to help get things circulating. She gave me this stuff called Hawaiian Moon Aloe she got at one of her conferences. OMG, feels incredible cooling on my skin!!! Will use immediately after treatment to cool the skin. Hoping well wishes for all!",

I Don't know much about triple negative, but there is a wonderful group of women who post on the triple negative thread far more knowlegable than I. What I have heard is that chemo usually works best for more aggressive cancers. I did not get a complete response, but had surgery to remove all remaining cancer and am on several treatments for the long haul. Wishing you good vibes and luck on this journey!",
