I can't hardly walk on them, I've done nothing else, the only thing I can think of is to believe the chemo somehow caused this....While i do have rough skin there, calloused and all, it hurts to even touch them......I've been putting lotion on by the tons, no help.......... Can A/C cause something like this? Or is it all in my head? Luv, hugs and prayers Deb Dx 10/23/2008, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 2, 1/5 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I finally ended up telling her to take it out and I would reschedule....I cried all the way home, cried for an hour at home and off and on all evening.....that's with a xanax and vicodeine.........Do they have to attempt to kill you to make you better?  Thoughts and prayers Deb Dx 10/23/2008, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 2, 1/5 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
