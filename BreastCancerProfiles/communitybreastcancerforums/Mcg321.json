My surgeon said that right after the surgery was done I should be out if pain, she was right at first. Now however I have started getting the pain I had pre surgery again. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with my menstrual cycle because I've given it a few months to make sure. Should I be concerned? Is this normal? Log in to post a reply",

I have an ultrasound scheduled to see if there is something there that cannot be felt when examining. I was told when I first found my fibroadenoma that there was a good chance that I could develop more because at 18 I already had one so chances are I will find another. After my ultrasound we are going to discuss a plan for monitoring it. -mcg321",

My surgeon told me the same thing that it was healing so that was causing me pain. She told me to cut down on my caffeine and take vitamin E to help with the pain so thats what I am going to do. I have an ultrasound coming up as a precautionary incase there is something there that neither of us (my surgeon and myself) can feel! Thanks for your help! If you have any suggestions on how to deal with the pain let me know!  Thanks, mcg321",
