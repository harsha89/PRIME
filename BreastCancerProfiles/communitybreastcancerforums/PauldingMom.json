Everyone keeps asking me questions that I have completely no response to. \"I don't know\" sounds so stupid. Ya'all are a great help, but what can I expect. Every story seems different. Am I for sure gonna loss all my hair. Am I for sure gonna have to worry about \"catching\" an infection or sickness from others. Keep your stories coming, I am learning so much here that NO ONE is telling me elsewhere. Which brings me to another point. Why is it that some women get soooo much information from there docs.-hospitals and all I have gotten is one lousy book that covers all types of cancer? In fact my surgeon told me to not go on the internet looking up BC. Honestly, where else is there to go? Thanks for listening. I love this site! ",

When ever I have to have a treatment, scan, shot or any other yucky thing I take myself back to the saddle and smell the sweet smell of aged manure and leather. I took 3 years of English lessons to Advanced Jumping. Then I changed stables and got a little more serious about horse care and stable management. I took private western lessons and worked at the stable through high school. Enjoyed one summer on a drill team and worked as a groom to some of the folks who just wanted to ride once in a while but wanted healthy well groomed horses. Well thank you for letting me reminisce. I forever tell DH that our next big purchase we make will be a horse. I just don't think I could afford it these days.

I am going to look for some caffeine free ginger tea this weekend, and of course ginger ale, just stir the bubble out of it. And yes, green is the new color. I had to announce to my hubby that chemo. poo is bad. Don't go in there. Not very lady like but he needed a heads up.   Those of you that know, my Mom is going through the same stuff as we are, just at a different pace. She  was dx a few days before me, had a mastectomy and thought she would not need chemo. Now they are saying she may. She is joining a study group and still won't know for 3 more weeks. So she may be joining our group. Ya'all will love her if she does. I'm still hoping she can get by with just hormone treatment.",

If I could find a four leaf clover and just wish this all away for all of us I would in a heartbeat. This is a great place to get information, but please talk with your doctors and nurses before starting any new drugs, even over the counter.  For my hair pulling group, well today was a little difficult. As much as I have tried to prepare myself for this I just can't get to that point 100%. Did the shower tug and the results were in my hand. Okay, I told myself, I still have a couple days. Then when I combed my uber fine hair with my uber large comb there were about 20 strands just hanging there. Took my anxiety pill and just wept a little. No break down just a couple tears. I'm going to be very careful and let it air dry. Feeling better now. Scalp has felt like it has a sunburn for a few days now.  Tonight my neighbor, who is the sweetest ever, is bring us dinner. Ham and al the fixins. She is very southern so I'm guessing beans and cornbread which suits me fine! I'm also off to get weekly groceries and then some simple yard work. Got my Spf 50, large floppy hat and good gloves.   RajinCajin: Sounds like youv'e had some rough bumps in the start. I can tell you a bit of good news that I hope will help. My Neulasta shot gave me the worse headache ever too. I had some strong pain meds here at home and called the nurse. She doubled me up on it and I felt better the next day. Then just he other day she told me that the next time I have the shot (July 28th)  the effects would not be as bad!!! I'm clinging to that with both hands. If you are new to this forum read back through and find all the other wonderful sites recommended. There some great ones here. For some reason I can not copy and paste here. (Google Chrome)  If anyone wants to send me a list of al these great sites I will add it to the opening post for all our new friends. Hang Tough Ladies! and have a great Saturday!  ",

You don't have to get your hair cut short, it may just make it a little easier. You won't start lossing your hair till week 2 after your treatment if you loss it. Chemo. is scary, we have all been there, but it is also very do able! It's okay to be scared, depressed even. Talk to your doctor. It's not something I am proud of, but I am taking medication to help with the anxiety and prevent some of the depression. Also taking a sleep aid. You may want to consider these options. Contact some of the great organzations in the original post for more information. You Can Do This!  I hope everyone is doing great today!  I've got so much to do this week it is nuts! Keeping busy has helped me manage.  Go back to work full time next week for 3 days. Then FAMILY TIME!!! Whoop Whoop!! We are all gonna sit around, eat to much, laugh to much and love to much.  ",

I was so sick of finding it EVERYWHERE that for me cutting it off was a relief. Now I'm not sure what to do with the stubble. I shaved it with a razor a couple times but am now letting it go.My Onc. said it would just keep falling out but I haven't noticed alot of it falling out, and I am afraid of cutting myself with the razor.  Glad to see others are havaing trouble with eyesight too. I think part of it has to do with dry eyes and just being tired. I have tried to have a tiny little glass of wine at the end of my treatment shortly before the next one and haven't enjoyed it much. The taste is off and the effects mess with my other meds. Just not worth it. But I have found a brand of ice tea that I have as a special treat. It Turkey Hill Mojito. It has lime and rum flavor and because I am avoiding caffine it is a treat.  ",

But when the tears dry up it's time to find your strength and move forward (never straight, from my wilder days. Sorry Mom.:) I'm going to start a new topic for those of us who are starting Radiation in October. So look for me and Eph3_12 and all the rest of us moving on to this stage of the journey. Even if you are not doing radiation (sounds pervie) come by and visit, please! Today for the first time in a long while a tomato tasted like a tomato. Yum! I laughed at you lorijo. I have to have a photo taken soon for similar reasons and it says, no hat, not head wear. I'm thinking to myself, really??? I do not want to look like Magnet Man for my pic. Big pink chick hugs!!

Gotta check on those white blood cell count before they remove it. Makes sense.  As for my hair. I shaved my hair about 14 days after my first treatment and kept is shaved for a couple weeks. Then I just let it go, haven't cut it all and it is a little less than 1/2 an inch long all over. Still pokes straight up! but it is soft and fuzzy. It's also warm enough that I don't need a cap when I sleep. I even had to take a razor over my legs today. I was told that my hair would fall out after each treatment but it didn't. It first came in gray all over, which it wasn't before treatment, but now it is browning up. I wish there was something out there that would make it grow quicker and thicker. Any suggestions? Sounds like everyone is doing well and either complete or at least seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Hang tough ladies and keep smiling!  ",

Mom is doing very well. She does have problems from the hormone medicine. Can't stand being in the sun and still has bone pain. But she's not one to complain. Hope you all have a great 4th of July Weekend. My DD had her nose reset on Friday from a accident so we are laying low this weekend. Two of my kids are coming home for BBQ and we are going to be grand-puppy sitting my son's dog. He's in Calf. doing an internship. ",

I don't have an exact date as to when I will start but it looks like the beginning of October.  My number one question right now it this: Have Radiation in the morning or afternoon? Which is better. Morning and then grab a nap, or afternoon and go to bed early? I was also curious as to other S.E.  I hate that I have to drive about 45 min. each direction to get this therapy, but don't think traffic is considered a S.E.  On the lighter side.....thinking up some Halloween costume ideas. Those of you who know me might think I'm kinda witty, but I am afraid I will offend others if I go as Uncle Fester.   Remember the women on the Titanic who passed up the dessert cart.

My biggest concern is it coming back. Scares the daylights outta me.  I asked my rads. oncologist about deodorant and she said do not wear it when I am having radiation, but I can put it on after. She said that, and I quote, \"just and excuse for people to walk around and be smelly.\" She was joking and giggled. I don't know if she has read the recent link between deodorant and B.C.   I've got the whole week off with no doctor appointments! Never thought I would be sitting here saying that. I'm trying to enjoy the normalcy of it all this week. Sure is nice to see so many post here. Keep um coming girls.",

No Hormones, then I was like, oh no, NO Hormones!  Surgery, Chemo. and Rads. and then keep your fingers crossed. I'm also doing the Asparagus juice thing. I mix it half and half with V-8 and it's not to bad.   Brookside-so sorry to hear about the flu, not what any of us need right now. As for me the fatigue is not as bad as yours but it gets to me. I'm pretty short tempered and could sleep all day if allowed. I hope much of yours is from the flu and you start feeling better ASAP. Okay girls, don't read this if you don't want to, it's kinda yucky. The deep redness under my arm turned to blisters this weekend and are now open. Yuck and ouch!! I keep using the silverdine (sp) and it still hurts like heck. This morning I rolled over and my arm pit smelt like butt. I've smelt that smell before when my chubby daughter had a bacterial infection in her baby fat rolls. So that's what I am guessing I have. I washed it with anti-bacterial soap, which hurt like he-double toothpicks and slapped on the cream. I'm afraid to use the vinegar as everything seems to burn right now except the silverdine which only helps for about 2 hours. Going to see the doctor today and hopefully get something else. I'm sick of whineing but damn it every move I make with that arm is painful. Like having a cactus under my pit.  Am I the only one???? ",

I haven't found much more they can do for us after Rads. I am drinking Asparagus juice mixed with Tomato juice. Asparagus is suppose to have something good in it to prevent reoccurance of BC. Exercise and weight loss for me is on the program too. Also cut out my daily cocktail and switched to a single glass of red wine. Of course the Multi-Vit, Vit. D, E and Calcium daily.

People love them and they can be very unique. Google Beaded bookmarks for some ideas. Gotta go for a walk and work off all the pie I ate. Mom, youngest daughter and I did the 4:00 AM Black Friday thing. Got some great deals! Hugs, Lisa",

I don't have an exact date as to when I will start but it looks like the beginning of October.  My number one question right now it this: Have Radiation in the morning or afternoon? Which is better. Morning and then grab a nap, or afternoon and go to bed early? I was also curious as to other S.E.  I hate that I have to drive about 45 min. each direction to get this therapy, but don't think traffic is considered a S.E.  On the lighter side.....thinking up some Halloween costume ideas. Those of you who know me might think I'm kinda witty, but I am afraid I will offend others if I go as Uncle Fester.   Remember the women on the Titanic who passed up the dessert cart.

My meds have been changed but the lovely anxiety drugs they have me on make me forget what the heck the name of them are. I will repost tomorrow. Chemo itself was a breeze. Now I feel a tiny bit light headed, and am looking forward to a good night sleep. The people at my doc office are very good, but there was only two much older men there, so no lively boobie talk to anyone. My lips are chapped for some reason and I started with the Biotene mouthwash right away. I have a general feeling like you get when you suspect you might be coming down with something.

I started taking an anti-anxiety med. about 2 weeks before I started chemo because I was such a basket case. I tried so hard not to be but just couldn't do it. I find myself easily exhausted. Saturday, I got up and went to the grocery store but when I got home and got everything unloaded I had to take a nap. Then I felt much better. We decided to go on a little motorcycle ride which felt great! Came home took another nap. Then went to watch the fireworks at our local park. What a great time. But I broke out in hives on both arms. Don't know if it was nerves or what, but I applied ice and when I got home applied some ointment. A bunch of you have voted but many of you have not. VOTE!!! Your choices are available about half way down on page 8.  Have a great Sunday! Tomorrow is my Look Good class!! Can't wait. ",

I got my shot at 9AM and by 6 PM I started with some minor pain. The skull pain started the next morning. Did you take a Claratin? My story: I am 46, married 25 years, with three kids 18,20 and 22. All in college, one living at home, one moves out on the 28th and one living in sin, LOL.  We live West of Atlanta GA and it is pretty rural but growing rapidlly.My story starts on May 13th. I had taken my hubby to the hosp. for very high blood pressure, they stole him over night. The next morning on the way to hosp. I got a call that my Mom had BC. we cried and then I told her I had a \"sympathy lump\" . Because I just got over strep throat I thought it was a swollen gland. Got hubby home, promised Mom I would take care of her after her masectomy and called doc about my \"gland\". She sent me to closest STAT hospital and I found out it wasn't a gland. So Mom and I have gone through much of this together. I have handed it all over to Him and that has taken much of the pressure off. To much info.? Did I mention that I love to chat it up. I like all crafts, have a home day care center, a Flat Coat Retriever and love to garden, but on a small scale. I love Lobster, Boston Cream Pie and was a military brat. I volunteer at the local nursing home, but not now due to chemo. I miss them, especially my FIL and his girlfriend. Well enough about me. Love your stories, now back to work. ",

I hate feeling like a drugie but I need to sleep and I was really lnot getting enough for a while. ",

I took some inexpensive, 2 for $5.00, ladies baseball caps and some of those pony tail hair wraps. we took the wraps apart and hot glued them to the side of the hats where my ears will be. We also found some cute sparkles on the clearance rack and dazzeled them up.

You be sure to wash those hands when you leave and use hand sanitizer. Don't make me come over there! I pray that they find out why he passed out and he heals up quickly. Saying a prayer of thanks for those babies of yours too. GillyOne I told Mom to post, even sent her a link, now I know she had to work yesterday and has alot on her mind but I still hope she gets on board with us. She has her first Chemo. on the 29th. so she will be a Triple J too! Ya'all are gonna like her. She is a wonderful woman and we are practically twins.  Balsie-I teared up at your post. I am struggling with this damn hair and know you are braver than I. My husband keeps telling me it doesn't look bad yet and I guess it doesn't but when I comb it in the morning it's really creepy. Have to clean the sink, counter and run the vacume. The other night, for no reason I caught him looking at me and said, \"What?\" he replied, \"ya know, you got a real pretty shaped head.\" I guess he is working on dealing with it too and he really made me happy to hear him say that.  I now have three wigs! But only one I like. The other two were given to me and neither of them fit my pin size head, nor are they the right color or cut. I ordered a petite from TLC yesterday. Can't wait to get it. Perhaps that will help me have more courage to shave it off.  I hope all you first Chemo. gals are doing great this morning. Remember to try and eat, I promise it will make you feel better if you can.  Hugs all around, Lisa P.S.  MOM!!?? Where are you??? ",

It's okay and probably better than holding it all in. I don't like the way I look in caps or scraves either but am going to do my best. It just a little bump on the road to recovery.  Did you purchase a wig? TLC has some on clearance for about $30.00 and they look cute. I ordered one and it should come on Monday or purhapes today. I have my second Chemo on Monday and am doing everything I can to enjoy this weekend. Just took DH and doggie to the park for long walk. Watched group flying toy planes and saw the geese floating in the pond.   My mom signed up under the name SallyMae but she hasn't gotten on the discusion board, but did get lots of information.

Way to go Triple JJJ's!  Christct: My dent is slowly but surely filling in. My scars are getting fainter too. We laugh and come up with different ideas as to how I got these scars. Pirate fights, Vietnam (no really something to laugh at but I was 4 yrs. old at the time) Ninja attack, takin' down some homies who came in my hood, ect.... Gotta laugh! Gillyone-on the triple Neg. No change in treatment, just looking for some new answers. Going to research PARP Inhibitors. Was also told after making it past the 5 year mark, most triple negs. have no recurrence. Also heard that most triple negs are pre-menopausal, African American, and test positive for BRACA.  I am pre-menopausal but that's it. I am trying to make sense of this.  Well back to bed.

She sent me a pretty crocheted Angel too! Makes me smile. I hope when this is all done I too can be an Angel. Sorry to hear about all the SE. You all take it easy and get better. I found some green tea with ginger at the supermarket. It was okay and at least it didn't make me sicker. Mom is bringing me some soft ginger candies next week. I hope she doesn't freak out when she sees her baby all bald like a baby. Oh yeah!!! I've gone round and round with TLC on the wig issue. Wrong one sent, then back ordered (really wait till Dec.??) then a little miss smartie pants who I gave the wrong end of the Chemo. stick to, anyway....got my new wig and LOVE IT!!! All in all TLC got in right in the end and all is good. If you haven't had a chance to check it out go to YouTube and search How to make & wear a scarf in under 5 minutes.  I can't post a link but the search should work.

Prayers to her and her family. I know when I went there was always a woman and husband that were there. She was getting follow up Chemo. and was obviously in pain. She would scream flinch when they started her I.V. It was very difficult to hear. We just received word that my FIL is doing badly. He is semi-comotosed and slipping away. He has a bed side nurse from Hospice with him. My Onc. still says NO to me visiting. He is peaceful and God willing should pass soon. Your prayers are welcome and appreciated. ",

We also have a couple of sweeties who started or have completed Chemo earlier and have great knowledge of the journey we all face ahead.Here you will find that we are all different and yet all the same. We have the best hand holders, belly gigglers, tissue passers, and even a couple of us who like to play doctor.  Here is my story, we all have one and everyone is welcome to share: Found out yesterday that I will be starting Taxotere and  of Cytaxan on July 6th.  I will also get Neulasta, to help with white blood cell count.  Docs wanted to wait 4 weeks post lumpectomy to begin. I had high hopes that I would not need chemo. but oh well, gotta get this thing taken care of. Now I've been told I will not be able to return to my regular job until October. I am hoping that somewhere out there we can find the financial help we need to get through this. I should also mention that my mother was DX 10 days before I was with the same cancer. No family history, just a flux.  I ordered my scarf and Laura was so sweet. She said to spread the news so here goes: www.franceluxe.com   I am very excited about this.

If you don't feel good, scream, yell, bitch and moan till someone listens. My breast cancer has metastasised to my brain, bones, lymph nodes and probably my liver. BUT there are some great drugs out there and they will be putting my name in a lottery to start a new trial drug. More info. when I learn about it. Keep your prayer and well wishes that I win the lottery! I had my first brain radiation today. It wasn't so bad but I have a bad head ache tonight. Chemo. starts on Wed. Tonight I am tired.

Got outside this weekend as the weather was beautiful. I am so pale!!! I bleached off the front walk so wore some old white shorts and I couldn't tell the diff. from my skin and the dang shorts!  But it was great to get outside. (I saved a little lizard from dome too:) Yes, I too have one more treatment, and 5 boost to go. Skin under my arm has turned white and peeled and keeps on spreading. Also got a little infection there. Also under my saggy boob. Do your best to keep these areas dry and get yourself some meds. from your doc.   Hip Hip Hooray to Eph3_12!!!! Way to go girl.

Won't be done till after Thanksgiving and am feeling a little down today. Not looking forward to the drive for what my doctor said \"may\" help. But I will do it and hope for the best. By the way, no one ever told me that you could never get radiation twice! I'll try and remember to ask about that tomorrow.

I actually talked to my doctor today in hopes that she would have some different news, but she said exactly what I had said about the 30%. She did point out alot of positive things though. Now Brookside- What in the heck is Tomotherapy. You are right, it does sound like SI-Fi Medicine. My rad. machine looks like something off a world war 2 tank. It's gunmetal gray with lovely camo. green highlights. I lay down on a metal tray with a head rest and knee props. Then this large arm with a big plate about the size of a semi truck tire moves over me. It has a little glass window with \"stuff\" inside it. It's noisy and there are lasers all over the place. The techs wiggle me and slide me to the perfectly most uncomfortable pose possible and then say ,\"Now don't move.\"  they then leave the room behind a glass wall and the machine hums and does it's thing, then moves and does the same noise again, and then one more time and then it's done. Takes about 15 from the time I walk in the room to the time I walk out.  Does anyone bring there own robe? I noticed one lady there today with a fancy robe in her cubbie. They ones they give you to use are weird and are like a one snap Moo Moo.(sp. I know that's not how it's spelled but don't feel like googleing it) I can't imagine life without carbs. I've cut way down on meat, sugar, caffine, booze. I don't smoke or do illegal drugs. I try not to swear. If you take away my carbs. something else is going to have to give and I don't think I would make a very good child care provider if I was walking around here all bald headed and swearing like a sailor with a smoke hanging outta my mouth. LOL Take care ladies, we love ya and we need ya. ",

Not like me at all. I figured that Sunday I would have been all caught up on my sleep and once again slept 12 hours. I also am having a reaction that I think is from the rads.My skin on my chest, neck and face gets little raised hives and itches like crazy. Now I'm only wondering, why my neck and face. There isn't suppose to be any radiation reaching that area. See my Onc. today and will find out.  Quick story-don't know what to think. There is a lady that has an appointment right before me. She appears to be going through Chemo. at the same time as Rads. She always puts down a plastic bag when she sits down, wears a mask, and gloves at all time. Has a turban or hat and scarf and is completely covered from head to toe except her eyes. First thing I thought is do people really do Chemo and Rads. at the same time?   Then on Friday, I was walking out of the dressing room when she was walking in. I said something like, \"see ya Monday!\" and she said,'Not if this rash doesn't get better.\" then she opened her gown and showed me the reddest rash I have ever seen on her chest. (Masectomy) I almost fell over. First, the rash was scary and second I wasn't prepared to be flashed by a breastless woman! My appointment time has changed so I am hoping I don't have to be around her again as she makes me very uncomfortable.  ",

Hope all works out for you and your job. Have you found something else? My right boobie is getting sore and red too. I keep plastering on the aloe and switch it up with the Udderly smooth and it still is red as is my arm pit. Worried because I am only half way. Got a sinus infection and between the rads and the infection I decided to lay off the treadmill for a while. I hate missing my work outs but don't have the energy right now. Everyone take care, we are getting there and doing it all together is so much better than doing it alone. Lisa ",

Feel like I'm at least half way. :) I know many of you are getting hormone therapy after rads. and you are not looking forward to it. On the other hand some of us don't qualify for it and feel left out of a possible way to keep this crap from coming back. So it's a win-loose situation. II pretty much told my Mother the other day to quit bitchin (sorry) about the hormone, at least she's getting something. I don't think she felt the same way. LOL  Honestly we have both teased and laughed together through this whole thing. I've shared some pretty good laughs with lots of you here too. Today is P.J. Day at Ms. Lisa's Day Care. Got on my long blonde wig in braids. I look like a 46 year old trying Way Way to hard! But what the heck. Have a great Halloween All !! Thinking of printing cutting out that little lawn mower man screen saver and putting it on my fuzzy head for a costume. What do you think. Either that or Uncle Fester?? If I do the lawn mower thing I can still put on some type of costume and not just a black cloak.  ",

It's either get a big tattoo on my head that says something crude or some cute hats. This is just my attitude and my attitude helps me a lot! So I am hearing that the private hair goes first. No bikini wax this summer. Whoo Hooo! but what about the rest? My doc said during my first treatment and only a couple days after, but I am reading here day 14 or so. Anyone know of a timeline or something? Come on ladies, jump in. It's time for me to have a group of chicks to swap stories and treatments with. Hugs from a far. PauldingMom ",

It looks like you already found the post here about what to expect with Chemo. It all looks like good advice.  I have a sister in Indiana, just thought I would throw that in there.  I have decided to give embordory a try. I thought it would be something to do while sitting during chemo. Does anyone else have any good ideas on what to do to keep busy.  I can not stand to sit still for long periods of time. I'm a little AADD but do not take meds for it. I like to read but generally for only about 45 minutes at a time. I'm afraid I am going to get REAL bored REAL quick. Did anyone's Doc say to avoid going out to eat? I thought that was a little odd for my doc to mention, bu then again I've seen some of these health reports and am thinking that perhaps he's right. Home cooked grub might be safer. Jacee, I also have older children. Age 22, 20 and 18. The oldest is a boy the other two are girls. They are all very supportive but each on a different level. The 20 year old girl has always been very responsible and is even going to take me to and from my next surgery. The oldest boy is scared. He always sees the glass as half full. He wants to help but doesn't know how and he worries way to much. My youngest is very busy starting college and seems very happy that her big sis is helping out more. She is helpful and honest about all of this, but often times finds it easier to not be as available as her sis. (Does that make sense)   Well my ladies, enjoy the rest of June, have a fun 4th of July holiday you U.S. citizens, and please keep posting!!!!!",

Finished Chemo. today (Happy dance) and Neulasta shot tomorrow so going across town later just isn't going to work. Besides I have 4 weeks before Rads. start. about the same time I should get this port removed. I'm sick of it. It works great but so many things rub on it and make it hurt. My favorite bra is sitting in the depth of my undie drawer, alone and empty because of this port. So how does everyone like the organic deodorants? Anyone try these crystals and such? I'm thinking blah, but will do what I have to. I like my pits to smell of Mtn. Fresh Wildflowers or Morning Lavender.  ",

One thing that I was not aware of was that the effects of radiation are cumulative. I was told that I would not likely have any of the skin problem, fatigue or other SE until after the 2nd or 3rd week.  They also said that I would not be \"Radioactive\" to others around me. LOL I was wondering how many people thought that. So I guess I won't glow in the dark, huh? Bummer, that would be a cool SE. Also after this consultation I will have two more follow up visits for marking and such. If all goes well on that second follow up I will get my first treatment.  They recommended pure Aloe on the area daily. If that wasn't strong enough they would switch to something different. I was told that Aloe worked well and was inexpensive, about $4.00 to $5.00 a bottle. My doctor was very nice, a woman about my age with 3 kids just like me. Facility was nice and staff was polite and personable. Yeah!!! Nothing like a b@#$#y nurse to really get under my skin. All in all a nice visit. Go back in one week for marks and a summary. They will probably go with tattoos as I have trouble with tape on my skin. Also showed me a video which was very informative.  Let me know if what your doc. says and we can compare notes. ",

How does that go? I also have questions about long term effects. Anyone have any insight on that? Since going through chemo. and now rads. will I ever be able to donate blood? or organs? or does having breast cancer just cancel all that out? Looking forward to my speech in October, but scared too. Any suggestions on what to tell a bunch of very young women about B.C. would be helpful. Thanks, Lisa ",

I am already taking. Then one more treatment and I move on to boasts. This was great news for me and really made me feel much better mentally. Sunday the 22. Is my office the only place doing Sunday treatments for the Thanksgiving holiday? My hubby is going to go with me and we are going to stop at IHOP on the way home. Then I came home and what is sitting in my mailbox? a 1/2 off coupon for IHOP. Icing on the cake!. It's the little things, ya know. I was laying in bed last night, thinking when I should have been sleeping, and I thought about what my response would be this year to the annual table question, \"What am I thankful for?\" The rule at our house is you can not say, God, Jesus, or anything religious. You can not name people or feelings either. So I lay there thinking.............of course all the bad stuff popped into my head which always happens when I am awake from pain and then all the good stuff came to mind. I am thankful for education that  people received that are now able to treat me, thankful to the results of my Bracca test, thankful for this discussion board and all the women on it, thankful for the Chemo-Angle program and participants, ACS, Crickett, and on and on and on. It's going to be a great Thanksgiving!!! We all have so much to be thankful for even while we are dealing with the C word. Hold your head up ladies!! Got to talking to a lady in the waiting room yesterday, she called my cancer the Popular cancer because of all the awareness out there. So there ya go, I'm thankful for being in the Popular group! ",

It works on your bone marrow and that is the reason for the bone pain (growing type pain). I am not a doctor, I just play one on BC.org.  I miss my morning coffee but didn't like the effect it was having on my and nurse said I should avoid it if possible. Found some yummy decaf. green tea with ginger. Gets me over my morning hump. Today is my Look Good Feel Good Class! I can't wait. Probably take a nap before I go. All you newbies and procrastinators need to sign up for this. Google American Cancer Society and find the location nearest to you. They can also set you up with a free wig and information. My only disappointment with them has been that they no longer encourage self exam. I found my lump all by my little self. They said, \"It tends to give women and excuse not to have a yearly exam by a professional.\" I don't disagree with that, but isn't both better? I'm teaching my daughters both, that's for dang sure. ",

Jacee-I personally didn't need anyone to bring me meals as I wasn't very hungry, but my family starved for a couple days! Actually I froze up a couple meals (chicken pot pie and a casserole) for their survival. If people want to help, I would ask them to bring something that was frozen or at least freezable for your \"off\" days. Hopefully you won't NEED them and can just enjoy a day without cooking. Gillyone-I was told 5 days before removing the dressing. Even then it wasn't completely healed and I ended up putting another bandage on because it was leaking (for lack of better word) I think I got an answer to a prayer!! I've been looking for someone to hire to help with my business and have gotten no replies. Yesterday out of the blue I got 4 calls. All seem like good candidates.

Just some gauze and a clear sticky bandage. Is everyone getting the Power Port or is there some other gizmo out there. Perhaps it's because of my layers and layers of flab that they didn't need to stitch just stuff and tape. And I agree, the port was more painful than my lumpectomy but still very do able. Just as the node was worse than the lumpectomy. I think it is like real estate, location, location, location.  Anyone having trouble with little blister/hive type things. I've got them on my hands and doc. said it was due to the Taxotere. I also heard from my nurse that the second Neulasta shot generally has less side effects than the first one.

My own mother won't step in here either. You are doing what is right for you. You will be able to pick through the negative and the positive here and just offer enlightenment to your mom. Why don't you sign her up to the Look Good Feel Better program? I went with my 20 year old and we had an blast!

You may want to double check with insurance as the cost is between $3000 and $5000 dollars. We were blessed that our insurance picked almost all of it and the resulsts were negative which means, I can't blame my MOM!! LOL but the most important part is that my beautiful daughters can't get it for me. I was told that they have possibly located another gene and I should be retested in a couple years (Braca 3?) Seyla-My Mom Sally Mae is \"Mature\" too, but you wouldn't know it by the way she acts. My sis is coming tonight! I can count on no sleep for the next several days but I know she will keep my mind off my next Chemo on the 17th, so no sleep is fine with me. Then Mom and Dad are coming. Looking forward to the house being full again. ",

I gave her the site name and info. and hope she finds her way here. She had so many of the same questions we had and I could tell she wasn't getting the information she was looking for.   Okay back to the hair thing......I've been told that your neither region falls out first.

They told me 5 hours too, but it only took about 2 hours for the actual Chemo. paperwork, counseling, and lab work ate up about 2 hours.  quarter405-Sorry to hear about the tummy problem. I can tell you, privately of course, I would have made a sailor blush with the gas I had. Pretty bad when you're in the other end of the house and the hubby yells back, \"What the hell was that?\" Just finished you're other post and I can soooo relate. Welcome Balsie, love the name! You are going to fit right in with our group! TwinMom-Wouldn't this be a great time for the twins to get to know Aunts, Uncles, Grandma's and Grandpa's,even close friends? I don't think you will \"scar them for life\". Think of it as a life lesson, Mommies get sick too. 3 years old is old enough to learn this. Take naps when they do, let them fetch your Gatoraid, and rub your head. Let them be part of the solution. I am sure they will learn to love helping mommy get better. Welcome  Kathry55 Welcome and if you have time take time to read past post. Great info. here. O2behealthy-Thanks again for keeping us posted. As for the headaches-I too feel like I'm just about to get a bad one all the time. Like it's just sitting there waiting to erupt. I am now on day 14 after first treatment. I feel pretty normal. I still need an afternoon nap if I wanna stay up past 8:PM at night. I do get up early, 5:00, and when I do take a nap it's a good one! Still have enough hair to look okay, but I've taken to brushing it over the sink as about 30 fall out every time I brush it. I'm just about ready to do it to it, but not quite yet. As per the pool. I am going to play doctor here (I DO watch House and Scrubs) I am going to assume that the Chlorine is hard on the skin as is the sun. Public pools, waterparks, ect. have lots of bacteria that can cause diarrhea. It is very hard to kill this bacteria with out alot of chlorine. I mean ALOT of chlorine. This is probably why docs. don't like pools. As for the ocean, I have no idea. I guess it would depend on location. My concern would be aquatic critters or cutting my foot on a shell. Of course there is always that irritation from my thong bikini and the mix of sand.. Sure is great to see all the new post!! Hugs to all ",

Found out today I am Triple Neg. but I did get some good news on the mouth wash stuff. Doc. and Pharmacy put together a mixture I can make at home with prescription drugs that ARE covered by insurance. Pre mixed stuff was gonna set me back $50.00 a bottle!!! PM me if you need the recipe.  Also told me that SE may and probably would get worse as we progressed. Stay on top of them was their suggestion.  SHAVED IT ALL OFF!! and I feel great. No tears at all.No horns either!! Just laughed and giggled through the whole thing. 20 yr. old daughter did it, first scissors, then 2 blade guard on clippers then no guard, then electric razor and then shaving cream and a blade. ALL GONE and it feels great. Wish this was the latest craze because it does feel good. Never in a million years did I think I would feel this way about it. Have gas like an elephant. Between that and steroids will probably sleep on the couch. Doc. said my new B.O. is a good thing (Damn, I just keep getting sexier and sexier) said it was a sign my body is absorbing the meds.. Was also told to put this mouthwash paste all over my lips, I am gonna be a real sight tonight with my little skull cap, white clown lips, B.O. and gas! I don't even think my satin red jammies will help, but honestly don't give a rats A$$ Hugs to all (Downwind of course) Lisa. ",

I started out taking 3 a day but have now cut it down to once in the morning and only when I feel like I need it. Family can tell when I have taken it and when I have not. Not so much b#$chy but easily aggravated and unsure of myself.  As far as unemployment, if you are married have your spouse also complete the FMLA. We used up my DH vacation time, between our vacation, his illness, my illness and his father's illness. His company has been very helpful but if he doesn't work, he doesn't get paid. Ouch!! I was wondering now that some of us are done with 2 treatment and some even done with 3rd! if anyone is lossing facial hair as in eyebrows and lashes. Mine are still there after second treatment but I've noticed some thinning. Ya'all have a great day and keep those posts and smiles coming! ",

Lots of people do machine embordory. Run an ad on your local paper or message board. minkityger-am am going to totally steal your idea for a scarf for my favorite NFL team. Go Bears! My mom is having one done for her fav. college team too. Gonna try the tea tree oil. My nails are not turning gray and peeling but are braking way back in a most unusual way. Steroids kept me up most of the night. This might me a southern thing but we have heard that when ever you see the number 1 repeated it's a sign that Angels are watching over you and holding hands. Well yesterday I received a letter from both my Chemo. Angels. and then when coudn't sleep last night I woke up at exactly 11:11 PM. Got up to read for an hour and tried to go back to sleep. After the dog and husband grumped at me that I was keeping them awake I said forget it and went to sleep in the spare room. It was exactly 1:11 AM. I think someone is surely watching over me, all night and all day.   Sending prayers that the same is going for you all. Have a great Tuesday! Lisa ",

Neuropathy really scares me as we have a very strong family history of it. I have heard that the B6 and B viatamins will help. Please talk to your doc. about it and see if there is anything else you can do. You may also want to search this site for information. I would post a link but am unable. Search Neuropathy How Long. It read that they were advised to take 200 mg of B6. Yeah PAP! So glad you are done! I know what you mean by number 3 being rough. It's just seems like it will never end.

It grew to a nice 1/4 inch from the last time I shaved it till the treatment I had on the 17th. So far it is still holding but doc. told me it would fall out. Waiting to prove him wrong. The eye thing kinda comes and goes with me. One morning I woke up to very weepy eyes. I was pretty scared and didn't put in my contact lenses. But it went away.  Nik Nak YOu have just hit a bump in the road. It will get better. Put the 4 yr. old in bed with you and watch a movie together. I have also been wearing a mask around the little ones. Let them draw funny mouth pictures on it. Take a nap, when they take a nap, take one too. Heck if they have runny noses, give the Benedryl. Sounds evil but I bet it makes them sleep and you can catch up. I had to hire outside help. It gives me a rest during the day that I have to have. On the wigs, I used a very light amount of hair spray only when needed and I use the synthetic shampoo about every 10 days. (I sweat like a pig so it get yucky TMI) I'm, what we call here, on the mend now. Kinda crappy all week after treatment and then feel much better the next week. Last night I actually dreamt of food. My tongue is a mess. Feels like I licked the driveway, but food once again taste good. You gals, hang tough. You know you will feel better soon so look forward to it. We've come a long way, no time now to be down. Time to pull up our big girl panties!  and perhaps have a good cry at the same time! Love ya all! Lisa ",

So far two doctors have told me it's not from the radiation, but it started when I started rads. and is worse after treatment. I've not changed anything else, no new soaps, foods anything else.

I'm sorry if any of my post scared anyone, but I know I am not alone when I say the hair thing is a big deal even if it is very vain. You probably won't start to loss any hair till about 2 weeks after your treatment. I cut mine kinda short with my Mom because she was getting a mastectomy 2 days after my lumpectomy, and she knew she would not be able to do her own hair.  That first round of chemo. is so scary, but your fears are bigger than reality. Eph3 12  I remember reading in another forum about swimming. I guess it's because of all the bacteria in pools. I googled it and found both yes and no responses. You know my theory, when in doubt as your doc. or nurse. I was afraid to use our own Jacuzzi tub here at home because sometimes mold (yuck) gets stuck in the tubes and doesn't all come out. I ended up pouring bleach down all the tubes, then running the tub and running the bleach through before I filled it for my bath. It really did help with the bone pain.  I also spray down my shower after I am done with a weak solution of H20 and bleach to keep bacteria down. Anyone else doing this? or am I paranoid? Welcome again to you new girls! Check out the opening post for some great sites. By the way ladies, the hats I received from Heavenly Hats were all brand new and came from designers. Not a bunch of  used baseball caps. All really cute!   Let's rock this day!!  I got a ton of left over ham if anyone wants to head out this way.  ",

Thanks PAP, I am terrified of speaking in public, but this disease has given me strenght to do things I never thought I could do. Like the Tim McGraw song about his dad, \"I went sky diving, I went Rocky Mtn. climbing, I went 2.7 seconds on a Bull named Fu Man Chu\". I'm gonna do it and lots of other silly things I never thought I had balls to do. (pardon my slang) I would love to tell you all that my parents have given me and my husband a great gift and alot of these things that I've always feared to do, I am gonna do. I may make a total ASS of myself but I' gonna do them. You better have the video camera ready Mom! ",

Not long enough for bangs yet and when I spike it it's starting to look like I cut it like this on purpose. On New Years Eve I actually put glitter in it to jazz it up a bit.

Some of us are done with treatment. Some of us have moved on to different hormone treatment, others of us are doing reconstruction surgery. We have all moved forward in fighting this disease. I can't thank you all enough for your support during the past year. I hope in some small way starting this topic has helped each of you too. I know for myself it was wonderful to meet women going through the same treatment. I've laughed and cried, I've shared embarrassing moments and some humorous ones too. I've held hands and have had my hand held also. It's a journey I am thankful to put behind me and glad I had you all to travel with.
