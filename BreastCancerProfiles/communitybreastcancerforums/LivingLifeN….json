I was told by my ONC that if I did have chemo, I would go through menopause--but then I was 48 at the time. With you being so young, that might be the difference. However, any period that lasts that long should be checked out. Good luck! Hope there are others out there that can give you more advice than I have. Pam",

My plastic surgeon said he would remove it when he did the implant exchange. No more blue ink, just a small skin-colored dent. I will be sure to let anyone who might need to know that the \"dent\" is a radiation tattoo in disguise!",
