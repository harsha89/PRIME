Anyway, I had a core biopsy performed three weeks ago today. I went in for a fine needle aspiration on a lump I had but was not at all worried about. The doctor that saw me was actually the same doctor that diagnosed my sister with fibroadenomas and he was convinced I have the same. But did tell me that my fine needle aspiration showed my cells as looking \"a bit weird\". He did say though that it was not a big deal, he is sure it's not cancer - I didn't even think it was cancer so wasn't sure why he said this - but that he wanted to perform a core biopsy because of my so called weird cells. Anyway, he said that he would probably see there was nothing to worry about and would send me a letter in 10 days time telling me that everything is fine and that would be the end of it. Two weeks later I hear nothing. So I called the hospital and the nurse told me the doctor was away and that I would hear back next week. That was yesterday, and in the form of a letter giving me another appointment for a week tomorrow. By this date it will have been four weeks since the biopsy. Judging by what I have seen on these boards, most people get their results in days. Not weeks, so does just asking for opinion, does it sound to anyone here like this is bad news? Would they make another hospital appointment to tell me good news? Has anyone heard of being called in to be told there is nothing wrong? And should it take this long? I see that most people on here are based in the States and I'm in Scotland so I don't know if anyone will be able to answer this. I suppose I'm just freaking out a little bit - though I'm embarassed to say so... Sorry for the GIGANTO post!!! And love and blessings to all you inspiring and strong women :)Â ",
