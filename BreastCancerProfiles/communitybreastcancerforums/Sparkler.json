    "Content": "Sparkler wrote: I found a bruise on my right breast two weeks ago and upon examining it felt what appeared to be a small \"lump.\"  Went to my DO to get it checked out.  He had done a breast exam just a several weeks earlier and didn't detect anything, but I haven't had a mammo since 2002.  (I know I should have.) He suggested that I just get a mammogram to just be sure, but he seemed to think it was probably just thickening of the glands due to hormone imbalance.  I am on bioidential hormone therapy and my breasts have been a little tender and have always been 'lumpy\" so I wasn't too concerned.  Everything I read on the internet seemed to suggest a hematoma or fibrocysitic (sp) disease or fat necrosis so I was feeling anxious but not paniced....yet.  Until the mammogram I got on Friday.  The tech said that she (the radiologist) would probably want to follow up with a sonogram since I had felt something.  The radiologist came in and ask me \"do you do regular breast exams?\" in a fairly condesending way and proceeded with her exam and then said that I \"definintely\": need to get this biopsied.  We called my doctor who was on vacation so I spoke with his ass-ociate who said that we need to take a systematic approach but this looks \"very serious\" and that it appeared to be \"suspicious for malignancy.\"  Needless to say I immediately asked him to prescribe me something for anxiety (xanax) because at that point I was starting to have waves of panic and nausea.    I go in this week for the biopsy and am trying not to go nuts.  I see on the posts that 80% of lumps are not cancerous, but after the comments from the doctor who received his information from the radiologist, I am not feeling too optimistic at this point.  Has anyone had this kind of experience or share their thoughts on my experience so far?  Debi aka Sparkler Log in to post a reply",
