In July I had a mammo as well as an u/s due to a lump found while nursing. I stopped nursing for the he's eating tests and i was told all was good. I had some dense tissue on one side. The surgeon said I had more glands there and would feel more there. At that time I was experiencing burning in my nipple, which has since stopped. I was \"normal\" up until a few days after my last period. I wasn't ovulating so thought it was related but it hasn't stopped IM pretty well scared that it's IBC, or some other Breast cancer. I'm wondering at what point do I go to the md with this? Is there something I ask for specifically? Thank you :-) Log in to post a reply",

The only thing that still lingers are many small swollen nodes in neck and underarms 2 days ago I started my cycle and noticed an area that looks pitted in my breast, like the pores are enlarged. The area also looks slightly pink. There are many stretch marked there, and when I show my husband or bf they both say it looks like dimpling in the stretch mark. I have these pores on both breasts if I move them so the skin is flacked, but it is different on the left breast. This area is a bit deeper and bigger. I do not have any heat, nipple issue, or swelling at this point. I am nursing an 11 month old, but do not have any symptoms of mastitis that I can see. I am really nervous that this is IBC. I keep trying to find some type of answer to ease my mind until I see the doctor again, but it is only making it worse. I know that no one can diagnose me, but maybe you could tell me if you have had something similar? My breasts have been through the ringer with this baby and the nursing, and I'm hoping it is only lose skin, but as you can tell by my rambling I am pretty scared. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and help in anyway =) Log in to post a reply",

In April I was told I had a ginormous lump (by ultrasound) that needed to be removed. 4 months later they say it was a milk gland so this has triggered me. I did consult with an MD, but my experience has been that those that have been through it are the most experienced and knowledgeable. I appreciate everyone's time that has responded. I realize that you are all quite busy, and that are many other people that could use your attention.",
