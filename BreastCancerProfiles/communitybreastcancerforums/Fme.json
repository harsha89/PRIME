Meet the oncologist this week and MRI next week, waiting for the genetics testing results and surgery will be mid January. It's Christmas morning and I've been up since 2am trying to figure out how life changes so fast. I'm a single mom withtwo freshman girls (high school and college). This was not something I even thought was a possibility based on family history. Definitely wrong there. Dx 12/14/2017, IDC, Right, 1cm, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2- (FISH) Log in to post a reply",

I just need to get thru the next few weeks so I know what I\u2019m looking at. Also hoping I don\u2019t have some genetic predisposition that I could have passed to my girls. Okay, enough worrying for today, need to get going on enjoying Christmas with my family. Happy Holidays",
