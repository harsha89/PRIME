I chose no reconstruction. For me, the less trauma on the body the better. I am totally fine with my body. I do not wear a prosthetic, although I might if need be maybe for a certain dress or whatever but so far I\u2019m good being who I am now & I go with what is. I found a sports bra that has supportive cups with a zipper in the front. Zip it up & I\u2019m good to go or I just wear a camisole. Hope this helps",

I had 4 rounds Taxol and that was an adventure, still dealing with neuropathy, I start CMF next Wednesday and am terrified, I had one A/C and ended up in hospital, couldn\u2019t tolerate it. I am constantly trying to lift myself up & be positive but it\u2019s hard to do sometimes. I don\u2019t mind the uni boob situation, I can deal with that just fine but the upcoming chemo.....wish I felt more confident. Hope you\u2019re doing well today- Nonni ",

I am terrified; I completed 4 rounds of Taxol, experienced a lot of neuropathy. I also had one round of A/C which I could not tolerate, so it was changed to CMF. I had a mastectomy as well. I just need to get through 4 rounds of CMF and radiation and I am so scared because the A/C was not tolerable & I ended up in the hospital. I am 65 years old, was always a fitness person, looked & felt 20 years younger now it\u2019s a different story. I need to know the CMF is worth it and is tolerable",
