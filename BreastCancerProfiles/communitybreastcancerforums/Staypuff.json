I was diagnosed with lung mets in October and have had a tough time since then, both physically and mentally. Shortly after the lung mets I also contracted pneumonia so along came pleural effusions of course, in both lungs. I just got out of the hospital this past Saturday where I was for 9 days, I ended up with a Pleurx on each side which a homecare nurse comes to drain 3 times a week. Before the lung mets I was on Xeloda for 4 cycles and the nodes at my collarbone shrunk down to almost nothing but the lung mets grew. Now I have started Eribulin/Halaven. I have read good things about this chemo so I am hoping it works on the lung mets and dries things up too. I keep trying to tell myself it is good that the Xeloda at least worked great on the nodes, shows that the cancer is not completely chemo resistant. Anyone out there have Eribulin/Halaven experience? Again, so glad I found you all, really need people to talk to that I have this in common with.",
