Or in the next three days being affected by it. However I feel what you said is true to me too I'm in Florida and you can call me anytime. I'm up all night with this new medication on the estrogen blocker. Even with the alternative medications nothing helps. I will answer any time leave a message if I don't. Please survive the storm you have a friend in Florida.",

They want to put me on an antidepressant that I was previously on many many years ago. And which I don't want. However I don't want to feel like this anymore either. It's not fair to my husband and my son, I would love somebody to talk to. This is all new to me new form new asking for help please reach out.
