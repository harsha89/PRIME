All they had me do was fill out pretty much standard paperwork and give them the CD of my images and report and they said I will hear from them by this time next week and  that they will forward their report to my Gyn. I was totally expecting more than that, LOL. I also thought there would be more asking about family history and symptoms. I found out that my great grandmother and great-great grandmother on my dads side (his mothers side) both died from breast cancer. I dont know if that puts me at higher risk or not.",

I have been craving sugar, my underarms have been much more stinky (bad, like never before), I have low vitamin D (which can also be linked to lupus), my left arm gets this odd numb but not numb feeling, I get so hot and sweaty at night that I cant have a blanket, periodic itching in the left breast, and I do have some nipple discharge (only when nipple is squeezed, both breasts but a lot more on left). I also have other symptoms that members have said they had but some could just be from Lupus. Sooo now I am even more worried!",

I have Lupus so pain is very common for me. My mom had a biopsy done earlier this year and she just has cysts. I am 35, married with 3 kids.. My report from the ultrasound says: For the left breast from 12 to 3:00 position, 6 cm away from the nipple, there is a nodule about 1 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm. This nodule is complex with multiple internal septation and hte septations are thick. Biopsy is recommedned. BI-RAD 4 suspicious I have been trying to find out what this could mean and all I am finding is info on cysts and mine says nodule. Is there a difference? Could that mean it is malignant? I just got my report and script for a consult at a breast center. Now I have to go and find out if they agree with the report or not and what they plan to do. In the mean time I am worried sick. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
