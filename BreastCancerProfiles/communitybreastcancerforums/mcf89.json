I've been bouncing back and forth between not being concerned in the slightest, to spontaneously crying for 10 minutes and being riddled with anxiety. I noticed several women in the BI-RAD 4 category who did ultimately have BC - if you are reading this, and don't mind sharing more about your experience, I'd appreciate it so much! My ob-gyn recently found a lump June 19 during my annual exam, and I got my ultrasound June 22. I just had my biopsy today (7/5) and was told I would have the results back possibly tomorrow but most likely Monday (7/8). During my ultrasound, the doctor seemed mildly concerned and pointed out one side of the mass that did not have the typical smooth edges that you'd find in a benign mass. He said I could wait 6 months, but he'd feel better doing a biopsy and ruling out BC. Today, he seemed much less concerned because the mass hadn't changed in size at all and told me there that these kinds of masses generally turn out to be 90% benign. I asked again why I needed the ultrasound if it was so normal, and he had a vague answer that wasn't helpful to me. I know we are supposed to avoid the google black hole but it's so tough! I'm 29, and my grandmother is the only person in my family who has had BC. I know none of us are true experts, I'm just feeling a little overwhelmed and wanted to share this post.

It's so confusing since at least for me, it was called \"Study Result\" but this does make me feel a little more at ease. Thank you for sharing your experience! And, I'm sorry that there is something more for you to deal with health wise but am very happy for you it's not cancer!! Will be thinking of you. xo",
