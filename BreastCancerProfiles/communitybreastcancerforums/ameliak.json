I have stage IV bc with bone and liver mets and I'm er positive. When I was diagnosed in England Aug. 2010 (my husband is military), I got chemo (FEC) which shrunk the tumors. My family and I moved back to the States and my doctor tried all the hormone therapie - none worked. I began gemzar and carboplatin in Sept. 2011, which shrunk some of the tumors. However, I just had a scan Mon. and found out the 2 biggest liver tumors  grew. My doctor is world -renowned and I trust him, but the only option he says is left is a phase one trial of a drug that I would have to get with chemo 2x/week. He says I'd be able to function well but I would lose all of my new curls, which I didn't handle well at all the first time. There's no guarantee this drug would work, of course, or that it would extend my life more than a few more months. I don't want to just be alive; I want to really live. I have 3 weeks to decide, as the trial starts then, but I'm leaning heavily toward stopping treatment and just letting my body (and my liver) do its thing. I have no idea how long it would take for my liver to shut down and what would happen...does anyone have any experience about this. Thanks for reading this far :) Amy Log in to post a reply",

Since I've posted, my doctor (Dr. Ellis at Siteman - who do you have, Canchaser)? has given me Afinitor w/ Aromasin. It's been a week of hell - severe mouth sores. Can't talk or eat - popping oxycodone like candy and rinsing my mouth with mouthwash they gave me that doesn't help. Someone mentioned Mary's Magic Mouthwash, so am going to get some of that. Anyway, not talking or eating, especially with 3 boys to take care of, is not the quality of life I want for my last few months in this world. I'm going to stop the Afinitor today. Much love to you all and thank you for your input! Amy",
