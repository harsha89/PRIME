I underwent the Oncotype test which I strongly recommend if it is offered to you.  Why?  Because my friend whose cancer sounded just like mine by description is now undergoing chemotherapy due to a high oncotype test score (28).  I was fortunate because mine was low (8) and chemo was not recommended due to the low chance of recurrance. I did, however, have to undergo 30 rounds of rads.  25 by a Photon machine and the last 5 which are \"boosts\" directly to the tumor site, by an Electron machine which the rad. onc. says is more lung-sparing.  Next Mon and Tues will be my last 2 rounds of radiation so the completion will be a lovely Christmas gift to me. Next I go back to the med. onc. in January to determine what meds I will take for the next few years.  Prior to the radiation treatment, he spoke about Tamoxifen for 2 yrs and Armimidex for the next 2 yrs., so we will see.  By the way, I turned 67 in June and also have a 14 yr grandson that I'm crazy about.  Try not to be too scared, hon.  These professionals know their stuff and there is nothing about any of your forthcoming teatment that you cannot deal with.  Fear of the unknown was the scariest part for me.  I had very little if any pain at any point throughout my treatments and I now feel quite good overall.  I know it will all turn out okay for you. Best wishes!    ",
