Ok so turn back many years, when I was 11 I broke my left arm severely, the doctors had never seen a brake like it. My elbow snapped at the joint and made my arm half the size. It took lots of X-rays and 3 surgeries to \"get it right\" (it's still not right). Also around the age of 12 I had a mouth plate to correct my front teeth, which also involved X-rays and dental plastic. At the age of 15 I developed a thyroid tumour -right lobe (benign) and also have had a painfulswelling under my right breast since I developed breasts. I had a hemi thyroidectomy at 19, but the swelling under my right breast is still there. It gets more painful as I continue with bad lifestyle choices, (I'm very educated in health and physical anatomy) but I continue to choose this bad lifestyle, due to my personal circumstances. Anyway, I've never had cancer (touch wood) and I'm pretty sure my swelling and the tumour I had is due to radiation and dental plastic which is extremely high in xenoestrogens. A chemical/false estrogen that can poison our bodies extremely. Anyway, I'm asking if anyone else has had this similar type of experience and if they have diagnosis for it? Any info would be great, thank you so so much! Btw I'm now 31! Xo Log in to post a reply",
