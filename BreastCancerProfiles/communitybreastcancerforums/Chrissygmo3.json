I' 29 years old an have family history of a lot of cancers with 2 of my family members having breast cancer around my age.(One is a bc survior) I've been experiencing pain in my left boob and have had multiple ultrasounds every 6 months to watch a lump that I've had for 3 years. I now have 3 lumps and the main one has grown rather big in size compared to 6 months ago. I went to a breast surgeon to have it removed because they said it was a fibroadenoma. When I seen the breast surgeon she told me I could either have a needle core biopsy done it get my whole boob removed..is this normal? Ofcourse I opted for the biopsy but why would she all of a sudden suggest my boob being removed. I have small dense breasts so there really isn' much to take off but still. I feel like she' hiding something from me an said it just so I would go with the biopsy when they said it wasnt' even necessary at my ultrasound by the radiologist. I'm also having another ultrasound to look for lumps behind my nipple on the same day as my biopsy. She has me freaking out now an this biopsy can' come fast enough cus I just want to get it done and over with. Any one else experience a breast surgeon like this? I don' know what to think.

I literally went to this appt to just talk about getting this big lump removed an shes dragging it on like she doesn' want to remove it. It is causing me a high amount of pain an would give me peace of mind to have it gone but I don't want my boobs gone if they don't need to be gone.",
