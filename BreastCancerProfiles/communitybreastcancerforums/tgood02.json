There is a good chance that it could have been avoided by going on Tamoxifen.Â It wasn]t offered. There was no follow up of any kind. Ask for it. Don't just let it go as I did.",

I wasn't given that opportunity. I was given the surgeries and that was the end of it, twice. Also have them put you on Taximofen. It will help to protect you",
