I broke my arm right below my wrist yesterday. They tried to straighten it in the ER, put me in a splint. The X-Rays looked good but they wanted it reviewed by a specialist. Saw the specialist today, who is aware of my lymphedema in this arm. He said my arm is not completely straight and if I leave it as is my movement will be limited and I will probably have pain most of the time and develop arthritis. If I have surgery to straighten it, they will place a plate and pins to keep it straight until the bones heel. Might still have pain and arthritis, but it will not be as bad, plus I should regain almost all mobility. For this type of surgery they primarily use a tourniquet on the arm to localize the numbing and give the patient medication to make them drowsy but not full anesthesia. I believe the surgery is the best option for me, but concerned about the tourniquet. Should I insist on full anesthesia instead of the tourniquet? Am I being paranoid? I know my LE will be worse regardless if I have the surgery, but not sure what to do about the procedure. Any advise would be appreciated. Thank you.
