Around 2 years ago i noticed a lump protruding from my armpit which has been going up and down for the past two years. It sometimes hurts alot which ive been told may be due to the use of deoderant or shaving. I did not think much of it for the first year, so i am not sure if these lumps dissapear or just dont hurt so i dont notice them. At the moment the lumps hurt abit but nothing major, however they are still there and last week they hurt alot with no use of deoderant or shaving or anything like that. I've had a blood test which shows i do not have hodkins lympoma (spelling??) but im worried about breast cancer. I have an ultrasound scheduled but i've been told that it could be weeks before i get an appointment and im wondering whether to go back and request to be refered privatly as my family have private health care. Nobody has been taking it very seriously but im very very worried :(  So my questions are:  My doctors say it could be an ingrown hair/Cyst/deoderant but a lump from that would go away after two years right? Do i get another doctors apointment in the same week and as to be refered to private health care as it means i would get tests alot quicker and be taken seriously Can a blood test detect breast cancer?  Am i just being stupid as everybody else apart from my friends do not seem to think much of it?  Lilly xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Log in to post a reply",
