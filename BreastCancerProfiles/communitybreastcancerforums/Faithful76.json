My doctor checked she wasn't comfortable she asked me to go for mammogram and they found calcification. I also did biopsy and the report stated DCIS and invasive cancer. My MRI report came back 6mm and no lymph nodes affected. I am waiting to see the Specialist but the wait is unbearable. I told my immediate family and we have been praying and I can definitely say when I pray I feel happy and calm but there are days that I get panicky but God is in control. I have not said a word yet at work because I don't want people to ask me questions so I will wait until I see the Specialist. Google is terrible it increases my fears but I feel not alone when I read all these comments. Thank you ladies.",
