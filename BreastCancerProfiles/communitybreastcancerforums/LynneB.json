He is going to remove the duct for microscopic study. Is that a ductectomy? This surgeon doesn't label himself a breast specialist; he was referred to me by my GP as \"a very good surgeon.\" The procedure is scheduled for June 1. I wish I could do it right now!",

Very good luck to you tomorrow!  I'm going straight to this surgery without stopping for MRI first, which is fine by me because suspense is worse than anything. In a few moments, I'm on the way to the eye MD -- before the breast surprise, my big problem was uveitis that (along with the steroid eye drops) caused a sudden bad cataract that needs removing. I'm supposed to find out the verdict on that surgery today. Too bad the two doctors can't operate at the same time, heh. I'll be thinking about you tomorrow, please post back when you can. ",

I noticed pure blood drops (is that the same as \"bloody discharge?\") from one nipple about 10 days ago. Neither my doctor nor I can feel any lump or see any other symptoms, and a mammogram and ultrasound were negative. My doctor referred me to a surgeon who I see tomorrow -- for exactly what, I don't know. This seems so peculiar to me. I am 60. The past few days I have been experiencing what I remember as hot flashes. I finished menopause early, by age 43, so this is very odd. I can't help thinking it could be connected to the bleeding because of the timing ... but maybe I'm just losing my mind...  ",

Breastfeeding six years ago causes bleeding (in one side only, mind you)? And now hay fever and pre-menopause causes it?  And vitamin E keeps your ducts open? I finished menopause almost 20 years ago, never breast-fed and don't have hay fever. So I'm expecting my surgeon to tell me the bleeding is due to going to Disneyland when I was 10 years old.",
