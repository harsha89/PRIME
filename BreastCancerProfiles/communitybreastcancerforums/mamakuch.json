    "Content": "mamakuch wrote: I had a Savi implant in 2012. I was the first patient who had it performed at OSF St. Francis In Peoria, IL. A factory rep directed the surgeon during the implant. The Savi caught on breast Â tissue, and the pain was severe. Five years later, I still have a hard lump where the Savi was. I had a biopsy in May which was benign, but I have to go for another diagnostic mammogram in November. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I wonder if there is an inordinate amount of scar tissue because of the problems with the insertion. I also worry that November's mammogram is going to reveal something else. My diagnosis was Stage 1 Grade 1 IDC, no lymph node involvement, seven millimeter tumor. Log in to post a reply",
