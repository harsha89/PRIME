The, \"I can't biopsy it because it is deep\" statement doesn't make sense to me. Mine was very deep (especially because I am very large, an F) to the point that not one of my doctors, nor myself was ever even able to feel it and it was almost 3 cm. It was difficult for her to get to and she really had to push hard but she was able to get to it. There are also many types of biopsies that can be used based on the situation, size, location, etc. Maybe s/he is right, but I would see someone who specializes in breast health even if it is just for your own peace of mind.",

When people try to make you stop feeling bad, they are not doing it to help you, they are doing it to get rid of the uncomfortable feeling they have from seeing you upset and not being able to do anything about it. Right now, you need people who can focus on you and what you need. My mom had breast cancer 7 years ago and I still had to remind her that being scared is totally normal and acceptable and that telling me not to worry was just making me feel like I wasn't \"doing cancer right.\" I won't presume to know how your family will react, but if you think they will react positively, you might concider telling them what type of support you need. I actually had to tell my husband that I just needed him to listen to me cry and complain and then just agree with me that it all really sucks. I think the crabby is normal too. I have been on a roller coaster of emotions since the beginning..and am also at home all day while the kids and my husband are gone. To fill my quite times, I come here and post on the boards to keep myself grounded. Otherwise, my mind does go everywhere. Take care of yourself, hugs and warm thoughts coming your way.",

I'm sorry to hear about your loneliness, it sound like you have had a lot of loss in your life. Is there any chance your mom could come visit for a few days to give you someone you can talk to? I too am a stay at home mom in a new town where I don't know many people. Is there a cancer center near your house. Go there and talk to the social worker if they have one, she may be able to find a group that is meeting for people who are waiting on results. Also, LittleMelons is right, you really shouldn't have to wait. I would call you family doctor and see if they can call and get your results for you. There is no reason for them not to. My doctor was going out of town and I had her leave permission with one of the nurses to call me with the results. I would push hard to get your answers before the end of the month. That's just really hard to wait for and there's no reason to suffer that if you don't absolutely have to. Hugs, Lee Ann ",

I gave myself a specific amount of time that I was allowed to freak out and made sure I freaked out to someone. I actually felt a lot better after and was more ready to fight and get involved. So, don't be too hard on yourself, just listen to yourself about what you need, tell someone and then keep going one day at a time. Slowly you will start to feel a little less traumatized.

My general practitioner also sent me to the surgeon for a consult and she did a core biopsy that day in her office. Evidently, it is not uncommon for surgeons to do that so you might want to consider having someone take you if possible. You might still be able to drive after, but I wouldn't have wanted to after mine as I was a little sore for a few days. Also, the earlier suggestion of starting a notebook is reallly great, because if it does show a malignancy, you will have many other appointments and it can be hard to keep track of when each test was done (every place will ask). It sounds like you have a great attitude about it. I think it is very healthy to have an \"I expect it will most likely be benign but that there is a possibility of malignancy\" view of the situation, as that is true. When the possibility of cancer even is out there, it is so normal to be concerned and it is frustrating no matter what you ask until you get a complete answer one way or the other. Peggy made a good point about stepping away sometimes, but I also understand how empowering information can feel when you are in the seemingly powerless position of waiting.

I don't know what kind of biopsy you had but I had a core biopsy and it was still sore a couple weeks later. If it isn't getting any better or if it begins to hurt more, certainly have your doctor rule out any infection. If it is clear, it could be partly from your stress. Cycle-path is right about asking for help with your emotions if you need it and has given realing good advice. If there is a cancer center near you, they often have social workers who are primarily there to help you get through this that you could call and could help you as well.

Maybe your S.O. can get you some free time by taking the kids for a bit so you can read and do what you need to for you to calm down. Fortunately, kids are resiliant and you will eventually get results and calm down. If you need to, I explained to mine that I was feeling a little cranky and that I thought it would get better in a couple of days but that I needed some calm down time for ow. I asked them to just chill out and give me some time to relax for a bit. I didn't give them any info about the biopsy or cancer. I hope you found some quiet time this evening to focus on you and get what you need.",

I have found out that taking care of myself will not make everyone else feel unloved. I reallized that I am much stronger than I think and that even if I don't work I can still impact the world for the better. So far, I have developed an even stronger appreciation for my husband and how supportive he is and I have learned that my children are stronger and more capable than I ever gave them credit for. Lastly, I have really discovered how incredibly blessed I am and how many really wonderful strangers there are ot there who are willing to take time out of their busy days to share a word or experience they think will brighten my day or lighten my load.  Thanks ladies! ",

Like you, I was confident in the negative results for the same reason and when it came back positive I was terrified and completely caught off guard. If all your pathology is back, the surgeon should be able to explain to you what grade and apparent stage you are, based on the size and type of cancer it is. In my case, they did an MRI and CT scan to look at the lymph nodes, but often they have to do a sentinel node biopsy to determine for sure if it is or is not in the lymph nodes. In the end, they did one for me. I'm not sure about whether or not they do that if you have a non-invasive cancer, like DCIS, so maybe someone else can explain what happens if they do that. If you haven't looked at it yet, reading about the types of cancer on this website will really help prepare you for your appointment tomorrow. It can help you understand what the doctor is saying and help prepare you for what questions you need to ask. Again, I'm really sorry for your diagnosis but you are in a great place for support. I've had my diagnosis just over a month and there are incredibly knowledgable and supportive people here who can help you get through this. Lee Ann ",

They have it over the counter now and since I have been struggling with being backed up for awhile, thanks to all my pain meds and muscle relaxers, I tried it and it seems to be working. I have also been eating 2 Activia a day to help so I'm not sure which is helping the most, but they seem to finally be getting me on track. Took about a week to get me regular but for the first time in over 2 years I finally am again. Just thought I'd share cause I had never heard of it before. Lee Ann ",

You can read about the difference at www.livestrong.com/article/254... . I eat regular yogurt all the time and it wasn't sufficient, but I'm sure it helps some. The Miralax is a white powder you stir in drinks, but I don't know if it is the same as Restoralax. You could compare the active ingredient, in Miralax it is 17g of Polyethylene glycol 3350. ",
