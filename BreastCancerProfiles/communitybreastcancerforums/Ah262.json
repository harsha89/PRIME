It was so hard waiting and feeling like everyone was taking their time while I was an anxious mess. I had to keep calling my dr back until things finally started moving.  Call them, make some noise! Tell them you are really worried",

I thought I\u2019d leave my mammogram/ultrasound appointment with a feeling of relief but instead I left with an order for a biopsy. I\u2019m also on the younger side (33). Did they say how long results will take? I\u2019m looking at a 3-5 day wait so by the end of this week or beginning of next week, I should know.  Amber",

Like you, I have bloody discharge from my nipple. My surgeon believes that I have something else going on in my breast so she ordered another ultrasound to check for any dilated ducts and mentioned intraductal papilloma and said if that's the case then I'll be having surgery.",
