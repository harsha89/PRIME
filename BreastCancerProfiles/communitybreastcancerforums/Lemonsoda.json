Also the recovery time after the surgery is so long that it might make any other treatment difficult. Last year I researched other options of local treatment to the liver, and finally got SIRT done (Theraspheres) in August. this has shown itself to be an effective treatment for liver mets, and can be repeated if neccessary after a year. The recovery time is very quick as well. My last scan in December showed a complete metabolic response. Next scan is in a few weeks time.  There are some other options for liver mets, such as chemoembolisation and chemo saturation (fairly new). Also don't forget that there are many women on these boards that have been NED in the liver after chemo alone. The thought of a liver resection can be tempting, but in my opinion, it carries a lot of risks! Anne",

I'm very good at staying strong most of the time, then something will trigger the panic button, and then I go into a downhill spiral. I found out yesterday that although the majority of my liver tumours remain stable, one has grown almost 2cm, and she is considering giving it a blast of RFA. Of course I should be placated by that, but I loved the stable boy, and the loss of him is hard to bear. I didn't want to get out of bed today. One of my friends, a survivor of gastric cancer - his wife also survived the same disease - told me recently that he thought I would be a long term survivor \"because of my fantastic attitude,\" and I think there is something in this. I am not suggesting that anyone who dies is in some way weak willed. Far from it, as we all know that this disease is a beastly relentless killer, but the point that I am making is that when I keep my head, I am more resourceful, more ready to find ways forward. This is one of the ways I keep myself from sinking. I tell myself \"Stay in control. Find an answer. There must be one outside there somewhere.\" When we are distracted and not thinking about the disease, we are not in denial, not any more than any other mortal thinks about death. We are just living our lives. I know this sounds like another of those irritating cliches that people subject us to. But I enjoy the time out. Being grief ridden and afraid is exhausting. Sometimes this is where I'm at. But I don't think I could ever do acceptance. Being in a calm frame of mind enables me to fight. I hope I will do so for as long as I am alive. Don't know if any of this helps answer you question, Laurie, but it helps me to focus on my strategies. Oh what horrible weather today! Anne ",

Then I changed my onc, and she ordered a PET scan which showed a low level of cancer activity only in one lobe of the liver (I have numerous mets throughout the whole liver, plus a tumour on my spine and one axillary mass). Seems that the chemo has largely \"turned my cancer off\" - for the moment at least. CT scans for the liver are I think hard to read, especially as they don't distinguish between active tumour and necrotic tissue. Don't be despondent. Listen to china. Sometimes it can take a little longer to get to where we want to be. Anne",

When I was diagnosed Stage 2 six years ago, I dreaded sometime being told that I was terminal. I dreaded counting down the days, weeks and months to my death. In the event, neither of my oncologists was prepared to give me a time limit. One said, \"think upward of three years.\" The other said, \"Be prepared to live for a long time.\" I find that I count up not down, and with great delight. Now fourteen months from diagnosis.I relish the thought of my two year anniversary. And three years. And four.And onwards and upwards! Anne",

The radioactive beads then deliver radiation directly into the liver over a period of eight weeks or so. The whole liver was covered in one procedure. Scan in 2 weeks will show if any benefit.

My liver had been stable on Herceptin alone, then just one new liver lesion appeared. Rather than go for the chemo, I chose radiofrequency ablation, which demolished it. I think I made the right choice, as it was a relatively easy procedure with instant effect. I know it's a matter of personal opinion, but I do not want to use up chemo options too soon. Just for one new lesion which can be dealt with differently. You are also Her2+ so there are other back up options available to you as well which may keep the cancer in check - Tykerb, Perjeta and TDM1. My personal philosophy is, chemo depletes your body (and your options) quickly. If there is another option, try it first. When you really need the chemo, then grab it. Don't forget, RFA kept that liver lesion inactive for a whole year. RFA can be repeated whenever you need it. Love and support, Anne",
