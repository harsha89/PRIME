My hair came in very straight, fine, and gray at first. But thanks to reading your posts I was expecting the kinky curl stage and it is starting. Just wavy so far, but I'm guessing where this is going. I've had the hairdresser dye it twice. Once was at 4 months out when it was only about 1/2\" long but I couldn't stand the gray. Then I had it colored again this week. I'm reasonably happy with how it looks - get lots of compliments on my \"haircut\" which always makes me laugh a bit inside. If people only knew the patience it takes to get this \"haircut\"! Isn't it interesting when you get to this discussion board and see how many thousands more visits are to the hair pages than most others? Hair matters in so many ways. DeeAnn - thanks for sharing your photo story. It is inspiring. Diane",

I like the idea that I can use them in so many different ways. Revkat - your suggestion looks good too. I'm going to try the buffs first and see how it goes. This board is so awesome to get us through every step of this journey. I appreciate your help. Diane",

My last chemo was Nov 20. On March 2, about 15 weeks since the last chemo, I went to see my hairdresser. I had very short, maybe 1/2\" fine,straight, very soft and totally gray hair (I like Otter's house mouse description). My hairdresser said it was long enough to color. I had been coloring my hair since I was in my 20's, so I knew I had a lot of gray but it was totally gray and I'm 47 and didn't like it. A week later I was hosting a thank you luncheon for all the women in  my life who were there for me these past 9 months. I had planned to wear my wig but I was running around the house like a nut for hours getting ready and got really hot. I just couldn't bear putting on the wig, so I put on a little more makeup and some pretty longish earrings and went for it. I had 17 women to my house and they were so excited and postiive to see my hair and kept telling me that it looked great. It really helped me get over the hair hump. I've since colored it again - it got really light quickly. It's now a medium/dark brown - the color helps it to look like more hair. It's about an inch long now and covers my head pretty well. Still straight and very soft (my daughter can't keep her hands off of it), but I'm thinking it will probably go through the curly stage after reading so many of your experiences. It's funny seeing acquaintances who don't know what I've been through and they say \"wow, I like your haircut -it's really short and cute.\" Those of you who are contemplating a shorter wig as a transition - I can see why! I'm still a bit impatient to have it be a little longer - it seems like it has stalled in growing the last couple of weeks, but is getting a bit thicker on top. Of course, like a watched pot - I'm staring in the mirror every time I walk by one. Happy hair growth to all- Diane",

I am still wearing my wig and expect I will need it for another couple of months. I just joined a gym near my home. I was having great success working out at a gym near the hospital during radiation and wanted to continue.  My problem is what to wear on my head at my local gym. I was going without hat or wig at the gym where I didn't know anyone. Now, I'll likely bump into aquaintances who don't know about my dx and I wouldn't mind keeping it that way. But I don't want to sweat in my wig, and if I take a Pilates class, it might fall off my head while I'm laying down and getting up. I used a runners type of hat at the old gym, but would eventually get hot and take it off, but again didn't mind because I was anonymous there. It's not that I'm terribly vain, I think since finishing treatments I want to move on so desperately and my hair doesn't quite allow me to do this yet.  Any suggestions?? Thanks, Diane",
