We don't want her to be in those tight situations and just kinda make her focus on taking care of herself and not have to worry about the kids, the house, the meals and so on. Good one Lisa. Thanks.",

She seems to be getting beyond the denial point (I still haven't). I will meet her this saturday on our schedule Christmas party. Thanks for all your tips. Need lots of your prayers though.",

It's odd why it's hard to find forums for people who are living with or related to BC patients. Well, I guess maybe since it is better to hear it from BC patients themselves. Once again thanks for the insights.",

She and her husband is a wreck right now. I have never dealt this close breast cancer patients and I am not sure how to be there for them, what to say, what not to say, do I assure her that it's going to be ok or do I tell her to expect the worst and hope for the best. My prayers are always going to be there but I feel like I need to do more than that. Last night all I could tell her was to educate herself on breast cancer, just incase it is not B9, then she knows what steps to take and plan for. And that this is not the end of the road, it's just a start of a new journey. Today is saturday, her biopsy is on monday and she'll probably have the results a day or two after, which means she wont know the result until tuesday. That is a long time of a waiting. Her husband even told me that since the time they knew about this, he would try and keep himself pre-occupied with work just to take his mind off of it. And when he needs to go to the restroom he has to go quickly, so as to avoid thinking about it. It's the weekend now, so both of them are at home with their 7 yr old twin boys. Should me and my wife be there with them just to get their mind off the topic. Last night after she told us and another couple (our closes friends), things kinda calmed down soon as we chit chatted about other stuff. I felt like maybe that is a good way to divert their minds. We both do not have family here in the US, that's why we formed a friendship bond to support each other in celebrations and moment like these. Hoping for some word of advice.Â  bcp_friend Log in to post a reply",

You don't have to answer this, but did you ever felt like wanting to stay away from friends during this kind of process? I ask this since, I did not want to overwhelm her with our presence and I know she might have a hard time to tell us to keep a distance.",

My friend has declined being accompanied, not even by her husband. Is this one of those stages that BC patients go through? I'm just hoping this indicates that she has taken a tough stand against her situation and she is trying to face it head on.",
