Gowiththeflo- is today your last day? Today, I have final whole breast rad and will find out if there will be 5 or 8 boost appointments. Either way, I am getting on a flight to Rome on August 4 for a 2 week family vacation in Europe which was booked the week before my diagnosis. Timing is everything. Espresso help me!  Welcome BeHereNow and SophiaAnne-Marie. Here is what helped me through rads: First, I had to take most of the summer off from work. I am a consultant and my clients are out of town. If I could have worked through rads, I would have only missed maybe 5-8 days of work, either for long appts or sheer exhaustion. The extra time to rest is a blessing, the medical bills piling up with high deductible plan, not so much. Next, the 5-6 day a week workouts- Zumba, Gentle Cardio, or just 30 min on treadmill with a book- helped combat the fatigue and energy. A few weeks ago, I took a week off from working out and didn't eat like a warrior. That week was the worst for side effects. The cardio flow of oxygen and daily smoothies must be doing something good. It is a daily fight to make good choices- getting to appts, working out, eating right, getting enough rest, using all lotions and potions, saying no to first and/or second glass of wine.   Third, honor the F word (fatigue). The best advice I got was to pencil in committments through this period, to give yourself persmission to say \"no\" - opt out of \"non-essential\" plans when you need to rest. I overdid it my first two weeks of rads- running my schedule as normal - ended up with sore throat, fever, high white blood cells- working against myself. Once I made better choices (and a round of penicillin), I felt better. And I now love my daily cat naps.  Not sure what to recommend for skin. Tried a lot of options- MiaDerm, Aloe, 2 RX lotions. MiaDerm soothes, but skins is still red, scabby, broken down and weepy. It sucks, but is manageable, and it will heal- - - soon! I sleep with open button down shirt with air conditioner vent right on it. I use cotton pads under cotton sports bras when working out. Sleeping has been an issue since Day 1 diagnosis,  I use OTC sleep aids 3-4 nights a week- generic Unisom works best for me. Will wean off eventually.  Just as rads are wrapping up, I finally learned how to manage them.  Rads will be a memory soon and at the end of the day, I will look back and say it wasn't all that bad. You can do it!!!!  Hope everyone has a blessed day of treatments! One day closer to your goal. ",

Wishing you all the best- enjoy your freedom from rads appts.  Paula- I had tightness and the nipple was/is being pulled down towards the lower incision (had partial mast). Check with your doc on what do to. I massage and stretch it every day to avoid additional scar tissue. My incisions still get red and swollen- more some days than others. \"not unusual\"  GoWiththeFlow- I could have written your post- spent 6 hours at Kings Dominion on Sunday. Must have overdid it , as had total meltdown on Monday- crying, yelling, sleeping - just tired of it all. Walmart's brand of Unisom sleep gels, 50 mg, works for me at night.  Update on skin product - my skin was blistery, scabby, rashy, warm  for about 2 weeks. On Sunday, I started using Hydrocortisone Valerate .2% in addition to MiaDerm and Aloe. Today, the surface wounds are about 80% healed. Still red under surface.  Will keep you posted, but right now the cortisone seems to be a solution. It is a powerful one, so long term use not recommended.  ChickaD- Don't be nervous, you will be fine! I don't think you need the sun. Just use your lotions and potions as directed. Back in the day, I laid out topless on vacations and later had a pre-melanoma removed. When caregivers ask how I got freckles on my breasts,  I tell them, \"you don't want to know....\" ",

Today will be #17 of either 30 or 33 and, in the last few days, the game seems to have changed. Still facing each day with smiles, \"who, me? I'm doing great!\", but more of my smiles are fake these days. :) <- that one is real. Since this is a safe place to vent: Not quite the same, energized positive person I was when I started. Headaches, irritable and sore. I have found that light cardio classes helped quite a bit with fatigue, but now the motivation to get to class is harder to find. Getting to gym not quite 6 days a week, more like 4. Can anyone share if daily exercise really did help them through the slump weeks? Are the last weeks slump weeks? GoWithTheFlow's quote \"how can we sleep while our breasts are burning\" is now so true. Paula-what is a bolus? Using MiaDerm and Aloe, graduated to RX Cortisone, too. RO says new study came out last week on a steroid cream for rads which she will RX if still scabby and sore by end of week. I'm 100% Irish, we knew the skin reaction would be coming. It sucks, but is bearable. (and temporary....) Sharon, I hope your skin stays stays comfortable. Use your lotions and potions. Shari, I can get MiaDerm at local pharmacy and mail to you in Canada. Nyama-yes, can feel slight prickles, too. Tech said not unusual. Seems like, \"not unusual\" is something I hear a lot in this whole BC process. Feeling so lucky to have just rads, admiring the warriors who tackle much tougher treatments. CT scan today of \"cavity\"... Be strong ladies!",
