Thank you so much for your replies to my post.  My surgeon's office called and I'm scheduled for a biopsy on 12/17.   I explained to him that if there is ever the slightest, most remote doubt or question with a test result, I want definitive answers, not differences in opinions from one doctor to another.  I want to take care of any issues now, not later.  I don't want the wait and see approach.  After all, weren't we always told not to put off 'till tomorrow what can be done today?  We shouldn't have to leave with uncertainty.  So 12/17, I'll have the biopsy and then be able to move forward, hopefully into the New Year with a clear mind. I hope you are all feeling well, and best wishes for a HAPPY THANKSGIVING.  We're heading north for the holiday; but, home the same evening for work on Friday.  I'm looking forward to the pumpkin pie.  Enjoy....

I'm new to posting on the board.  I've read and can relate to many of your posts and wish you all the best.  I have a question.  It's been 1 1/2 years since my surgery and I'm now going for another session of 6 month follow-up pictures.  My mammo was fine; however, my MRI is showing an axillary lymph node of \"questionable significance\" on my cancer side.  Does anyone know what that terminology means?  I have a horrific history of BC in my family on my mother's side.  Within the past 5 years, I've lost my mother, grandmother, three aunts and a cousin to BC.   My father past away last year of cancer, one month before my diagnosis.  And....to add to this, my husband suffered a heart attack in April of this year.  <sigh>  I'm at my breaking point.  Last week, I saw my surgeon who couldn't give me a definitive answer as to what to do about the lymph node.  He finally said we'll do an ultrasound with biopsy.  I'm 52 and want to make sure that I do everything within my means to maintain peace-of-mind.  I cannot live with uncertainty.  I feel at times that no one really understands the anxiety which we live with.  Anyway, thanks for listening.  Hugs and best wishes for a Happy Thanksgiving holiday!  Dona",
