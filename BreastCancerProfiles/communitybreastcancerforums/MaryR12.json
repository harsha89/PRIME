I know as a patient who received 33 radiation treatments, and getting ready to proceed with reconstruction, I am worried about the splitting open issue. If I saved one of the links I visited, I will attach below.  There are also Barometric Oxygen Therapy treatments  that are now available for any skin with open wounds that do not heal. (similar to Michael Jackson). Hope this helps, MaryR12 www.oxygenheals.com Sorry, I do not have a link for splitting open issue, but you can google it. ",
