I had to go thru crap to create this account in order to deliver this mess to u , I hope u get it. My name is Carlene and I'm going to leave out \"my story\" in order to get to the important thing u need to know. Bla bla bla(my story) ....... Then it meta to a single gland under my collarbone, while I was still on chemo for another meta my neck was held at bay but all of a sudden my neck (RT side) took off growing nearly overnite!!! My oncol didn't seem to worry about it, of course we were guna do some chemo but not alarmed. I started getting PAIN in my neck down to my shoulder blade SEVERE PAIN my oncol kept prescribing me muscle relaxers and nerve pills and telling me to take more GABAPETTIN (u may know it's a med for nerves like neuropathy in ur toes or fingers NOT the kind of pain I suffered they kept putting my neck, shoulder, and now ARM,ELBO,AND FINGERS on the back burner \"oh it's nothing\" then a went to my sisters dr. A radiology Specialist and soon as he saw my arm on a pillow and how enlarged my neck was he said \"YOUR NECK IS FULL OF CANCER AND ITS iPINCHING ON THE NERVES COMMING FROM YOUR SPINE! AND IF WE DONT DO RADIATION RIGHT AWAY YOUR GOING TO HAVE PERMENATE NERVE DAMAGE AND BE IN THIS PAIN FOREVER!!!!my god all those other dr's dropped the ball!!!! They had no idea! So I don't know if they have gotten the cancer out but if they have then u have perm nerve damage or there's still cancer in there pushing on that nerve!!! I KNOW THE PAIN GIRL I HV MINE RIGHT NOW! Hopefully we'll. Start radi few days cuz I'm so scared its going to be perm. Pls write me bk let me know what happened. Good luck Carlene",
