And what are they getting out of it?   But I wish to leave you with our sincere promise that we put 100% of every research-designated donation received into our MBC research grant ... we promise that to our donors and we make good on that promise.    I wish you all the very best.  CJ (Dian M.

Welch, Ph.D.  We initially intended to award our second grant in January 2011.  We ran a little behind in raising the funds at that point, but quickly caught up and did indeed award not only one grant but two grants that year.  They were awarded Oct 2011 to Alana Welm, Ph.D. and Andrea Mastro, Ph.D.  This year we are well on track to award even more grant funding.  Our request for research grant proposals for 2012 is now out.  We are very confident we will continue to award annual research grants well into the future and that the amount of grant money will increase annually.  I would  like to clarify that 100% of every donation (minus 2.3% in PayPal fees when applicable) and 100% of all fundraiser proceeds after expenses, go into our research grants.  We are a 100% volunteer organization and our expenses are paid from store sales and grants we receive that are specified for such use only. ",
