And from your post I can tell that you have thought this through, and you have made your decision. You seem mature and aware of the difficulties that you and your child could face. I lost my Mom when I was young, as many people have. It is a life altering experience and I don't think there is a mother on this Stage IV board with young children who doesn't live with the constant fear of having to leave their babies. I truly wish you all the best, both with your treatment and with your new baby. I hope you enjoy many years together!!!! And just an aside to all... Coolbreeze has been a constant target here for no other reason it seems than because she is very honest and outspoken. Why is that so threatening? Jejik has stated that she's not offended, and she goes on to explain her understanding of Coolbreeze's comments. It would be horrific if we were all little Stage IV clones, repeating the same \"politically correct\" jargon to one another without a disagreeable word. original thought, or honest opinion. Now that truly is a fate worse than death! ",

I've been stage iv for six and a half years, and in the beginning I felt like I could tackle it all. I only told a handful of people too, and really thought I could tough it out! This website was my lifeline then, and still is to a certain extent. But I realize now that I need help. I should have reached out years ago I think. The isolation is scary, I hate it. And although my partner is supportive, he travels for work all the time and I'm left alone with my thoughts. No one can truly understand what this is like unless they are going through it themselves. I'm not in MI, I'm in CA. But you've received good advice here, and we're all here for you! Maybe there's a local support group for stage iv? I've never been to one myself, but I have seen a counselor and just voicing my fears helped so much. Sending you love... Rose. ",

But I'm hoping that this week in peace and privacy at your friend's may be just what you need. Too bad you don't have two weeks! In any case, recover and regroup... I hated to see you so upset.

The most important thing is that Elka's decision is being supported, her wishes granted. There is no right or wrong decision re. more treatment, no \"giving up,\" or continuing to \"fight.\" We are all buying time at Stage IV... we can't cure the cancer. But exercising our right to continue treatment if our bodies are strong enough or to stop treatment if we have had enough of it is still within our control. Honoring whatever choice is made is such a gift. You are the most wonderful support for your wife! I hope that the Halaven will stabilize her and give her more than a few months or years with you and your boys. No one can predict what will happen... we can only move forward with hope. Wishing you all the very best... Rose. ",

It does get noisy and crowded though, so it may not be ideal for catching up with old friends. Still, you must go and experience it, and if you like cheesecake... it's yummy! There's another restaurant nearby that's quieter.. it's an Italian place called Sofia's. They are both populated with tourists of course... the local ladies will be able to suggest the hidden gems.

There is currently no other evidence of mets. I'm also having my ovaries removed at the time of the mastectomy. I appreciate that my oncologist is being so aggressive with her plan of attack, but I don't know what to think about the radiation. Any input would be much appreciated!          Dx 1/22/2010, IDC, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I was diagnosed at Stage IV so I was never \"not diagnosed but worried.\" In fact, I was never worried about my health until my diagnosis! Never imagined breast cancer, let alone Stage IV! I was always healthy, never visited the doctor (!!)... yes... a bit naive I know. I thought somehow I was immune if I just ate the right foods, exercised... you all know the drill. So in answer to your question, Ann... you better believe I wish I could get away from this crap!!!! But I suffer from a bit of denial, always have, and probably even on my death bed I will be planning my incredible escape. This board snaps me back to reality, and that's why I visit often. It's painful, yes, mostly because the names of all of you have taken on lives and personalities and I've grown very attached. When we lose someone it's both heartbreaking and very, very sobering. I would so much rather talk about fashion, vacations, good books, movies, coconut popsicles, denial, denial, denial, denial... and it is my ultimate fantasy that a cure is found and this board would be dismantled!!!! Of course then we could continue our discussions elsewhere about our fabulous, charmed lives... xoxo Rose.    ",

But the mystery has allowed me to fill in the blanks, and my memories are warm and loving. My niece lost her Mom at 4 to lung cancer, and she did leave audio recordings behind. My niece listened to them when she turned 18, and it was so comforting for her to hear her mother's voice again. I don't have children, so I don't face this dilemma, but personally I think I would feel uncomfortable making video or audio tapes. I think I'd rather remain a mystery like my Mom.

I know her through Yan! In the brief time I have been posting here, you and Olga were the first to draw me in. It was the sweet picture of you kissing her cheek that caught my attention. Olga's beautiful face beaming with happiness... the obvious love between you. I'm not a religious person, but I do believe in souls. Our loved ones may  physically leave this earth, but their souls stay with us. I love what you told your boys about looking in the mirror and seeing Olga. And how wise of you to have the social worker help them with their feelings. As someone who lost their mother at a young age, I know this would have helped me so much... talking about all of those complicated feelings that adults can't even understand. You are an exceptional man, as Olga was an exceptional woman. The fact that you found each other does not surprise me. I hope you will take the time you need for yourself, and find comfort in your sons... lean on each other... as you bravely move forward. Olga has touched me. Thank you for sharing your life. Rose.   ",

Anyway, the support here is wonderful from people of all ages. DO NOT GIVE UP YOUR DREAMS!!!! My dreams help me stay positive and focused on the future. Bone mets are treatable!

Although I'm now a cancer patient, when I was in my 20's I was my Dad's caregiver as he battled the same disease. The best advice I can give you is to be sure that you take very good care of yourself, and that you maintain some sort of life for yourself. I was in school too when my Dad was diagnosed, and I returned home to care for him. I tried commuting the 3 hour drive back and forth for awhile until that became too much and I dropped out. Of course that depressed me even more! Because you've joined your Mom in another country, you've obviously completely uprooted yourself. Are there online classes you could take? Do you have friends where you are? Can your siblings help at all? You are so young and tackling so much... I guarantee that your Mom worries about you, whether she verbalizes it or not. She wants you to be HAPPY, and strong enough to go on without her. I know it's hard to imagine life without her... I was very close to my Dad too and I know how painful it is. But the biggest gift you could give her is to go on and live a full life. You're obviously a wonderful, caring daughter... I wish you all the very best! Rose.",

The procedure itself was a little more difficult than I imagined (pain wise). But I'm guessing this was because it came on the heels of my mastectomy and ovary removal.

I realize that for me this goes deeper than just this incident. My cousin died of cancer in 1998, and left a 5 year old daughter behind. Her husband and his family are not nice people, and said some horrible things about my cousin. I felt so powerless to speak up at the time. My family is mostly gone, and I was overwhelmed with grief. Now I think I see this as an opportunity to make up for that somehow. I'm normally very calm and laid back, but I think my own cancer has shaken me. I have so much respect for everyone here, and all of your opinions. It makes me feel less crazy! How could anyone else possibly understand?

I went to lunch with a friend of mine a few months ago, and she invited another woman, who is a friends of hers. I've met this other woman before, and I liked her well enough. She's a young mother (30's), married, and she knows about my cancer. I was sort of ignored at lunch, which I understand because they were catching up. But then they brought up a woman, I'll call her Jill, an acquaintance of mine who had just died of cancer. I would see Jill on my walks, and one day as we passed each other, she stopped me and told me she had stage iv colon cancer. Very few people know I have cancer, but I opened up to Jill, and although we never shared much else about our lives, we shared that bond. We cheered each other on for months, until she disappeared. I saw her obituary in the paper in May. Her death really upset me. So back to the lunch... this other woman told us that Jill was a \"very controlling woman,\" that she bossed everybody around, orchestrated everything in her life, until the day she died. She went on to say that she had an unhappy marriage, that her husband was cheating on her when she was sick, and that basically nobody liked Jill. This was apparently all told to her by Jill's sister-in-law. It was everything I could do not to flip the table! I was so angry, I could barely contain myself. I defended Jill as best I could, but I was just devastated and wanted to cry. I know it's just nasty gossip, and none of us really knew about Jill's life, but it hurt so much to hear this. Especially since Jill left two young children behind. And this nasty gossip was delivered so flippantly! Now I have to face this woman again at another event that my friend has set up. My friend doesn't understand why I can't get over my feelings about this incident. That yes, it was thoughtless, but Jill was just an acquaintance after all, and I should get over it. I realize my audience here is biased, but I also know that if I'm being a big baby, y'all will call it! I'm not usually this sensitive, but this hit a nerve. Thanks for reading this long post!!   Dx 1/22/2010, IDC, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "steelrose wrote: Ladies, this is a bit OT, but I need your opinion on something that's been bothering me. I went to lunch with a friend of mine a few months ago, and she invited another woman, who is a friends of hers. I've met this other woman before, and I liked her well enough. She's a young mother (30's), married, and she knows about my cancer. I was sort of ignored at lunch, which I understand because they were catching up. But then they brought up a woman, I'll call her Jill, an acquaintance of mine who had just died of cancer. I would see Jill on my walks, and one day as we passed each other, she stopped me and told me she had stage iv colon cancer. Very few people know I have cancer, but I opened up to Jill, and although we never shared much else about our lives, we shared that bond. We cheered each other on for months, until she disappeared. I saw her obituary in the paper in May. Her death really upset me. So back to the lunch... this other woman told us that Jill was a \"very controlling woman,\" that she bossed everybody around, orchestrated everything in her life, until the day she died. She went on to say that she had an unhappy marriage, that her husband was cheating on her when she was sick, and that basically nobody liked Jill. This was apparently all told to her by Jill's sister-in-law. It was everything I could do not to flip the table! I was so angry, I could barely contain myself. I defended Jill as best I could, but I was just devastated and wanted to cry. I know it's just nasty gossip, and none of us really knew about Jill's life, but it hurt so much to hear this. Especially since Jill left two young children behind. And this nasty gossip was delivered so flippantly! Now I have to face this woman again at another event that my friend has set up. My friend doesn't understand why I can't get over my feelings about this incident. That yes, it was thoughtless, but Jill was just an acquaintance after all, and I should get over it. I realize my audience here is biased, but I also know that if I'm being a big baby, y'all will call it! I'm not usually this sensitive, but this hit a nerve. Thanks for reading this long post!!   Dx 1/22/2010, IDC, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

In other words, it prolongs your run on this particular AI. The SOLE trial makes sense, but personally I would worry about the break in treatment given that we're Stage IV. On the other hand, you're doing incredibly well and if there's a time to experiment I suppose it's now!

I also didn't lose my hair. Avastin is an excellent drug for so many, I was surprised when they yanked it soon after my last dose. I think it's hard to come by in the U.S. now.

I think of you and your daughter often and I wish peace for both of you. You and Apple have made me emotional tonight. You are inspirations. Love to you... Rose.  ",

The bumps are fading now, and my skin isn't nearly as inflamed. It was really horrible and uncomfortable! As far as creams go, I've tried them all. Eucerin (in the tub) works very well for dryness, especially on the feet. I also use cocoa butter, which smells nice and works well. You'll probably want to experiment and find out what works best on your skin. Hopefully you're seeing your onc. soon?? He/she may be able to prescribe something for the itchiness too.

As to why people seek alt treatments, I suppose the answers are as varied as our individual cancers. Personally, conventional treatment brought me to NED and I'm very grateful for that.

      "Content": "steelrose wrote: I've hesitated to post about this, mainly because I feel like I should be grateful that my cancer is stable after six and a half years at Stage IV, and also because I don't want to scare anybody. After progression last May, I went on chemo (Doxil) until October '15. Scans were good, and I switched to Ibrance/Aromasin in Nov. with good results. In April '16 I developed neuropathy and started having trouble walking. This got worse and I went to the emergency room on May 27, fearing that the cancer was compressing my spinal cord again. Well, after countless scans and tests including a brain MRI, lumbar puncture, spinal MRI... you all know the drill... I was clear for cancer. So the neurologist has diagnosed me with CIDP, some weird disorder that I don't even understand. But he's not 100% sure this is the problem. Still, I've had four IVIG treatments for this with no improvement so far. In fact I think I'm worse! I can barely walk even with a walker, I have to lay down after the simplest tasks, and I haven't driven or hardly left the house since early June. I'm flat out miserable. This is not quality of life!!! All the while I'm convinced that the Ibrance/Aromasin is the culprit, despite my oncologist's denial. She briefly took me off both drugs before I was diagnosed with CIDP, with no improvement so I'm back on both. The Aromasin seems to cripple me even more with severe joint pain. I'm thinking about quitting both drugs and maybe going on a milder anti-hormonal to give my body a break. Any ideas what might be tolerable? What would you do? Thanks for reading this, and sorry for my whining. I just can't believe that cancer isn't the problem here... Rose. Dx 1/22/2010, IDC, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

The Aromasin may actually be tougher than the Ibrance, I think... of course tomorrow I'll be blaming everything on Ibrance:) Z, thank you. I'm doing my homework on CIDP, and hoping the treatments take hold. I'd like to take a break from treatment but honestly I'm too scared right now. Maybe down the road (and I'm hoping for a LONG road!). But I always want that option and we absolutely have options. Our bodies, our decisions, as Stagefree says! I hope you're doing well on Ibrance. Bestbird, as always your input is smart and well researched. Thank you!! I actually thought about proposing Tamoxifen to my MO if and when I decide to take a break. It was my first treatment after diagnosis in 2010. I've heard of Megace but not the other drugs... will have to check those out too. As for MS, the neurologist has done extensive bloodwork and hasn't mentioned it, but it has crossed my mind. The symptoms are indeed similar. Hope you're doing well, and I always appreciate you. Ebru, just nice to hear from you with all you've been going through. Thank you for your wise words about qol. I hope things are a bit more settled for you now. Sending love, as always. And I've received so many nice messages from non- stage iv ladies! I see that many have experienced autoimmune disorders after and during cancer treatment. This is a real problem, and one that I feel the oncologist's don't want to deal with. At least mine doesn't want to address that there may be a connection. It's important for us to share stories.

I'm getting around with a walker, but I've fallen a few times when I get daring with my cane. It's so depressing. The neuropathy seems to be creeping up my body, and it's effecting all sorts of interesting things (I'll avoid TMI here). I remain on Ibrance/Aromasin because I do believe it's keeping the cancer in check at least. But on another bizarre note, my onc. is holding firm on \"the cancer meds didn't cause this!\" while recommending a second opinion from my current neurologist (whom she recommended)... at the Mayo clinic no less. AND she asks me if I want to go on chemo (Gemzar) to possibly put me into complete stage iv remission and prove that the Ibrance/Aromasin isn't the culprit. Am I the only one who thinks this is all crazy, or maybe it's just me?? I'm more confused than ever! So very grateful for all of you being here... Rose.",

Be sure to put lots of lotion on hands and feet starting now(I have Cetaphil, Aquaphor, and I'm ordering the Milkweed Balm). I slather my hands with Aquaphor and wear gloves when I'm at home. After the third round of Doxil, things got worse. But you may not suffer from this at all\u2026 everyone's different.

I couldn't have done it without his love and support.  I think the important thing to remember is that our loved ones feel perhaps even more helpless than we do. I know how hard it is to accept that we even need help, let alone accept it. But the one thing that cancer has taught me, early on, is that there are some wonderful, compassionate people out there. And if I let go just a little bit, let them pick up a bit of slack, we both feel better. Like you, I often get overwhelmed but I try to counteract that with as much private time as the day will allow, to do the things that calm me, ALONE.

After progression last May, I went on chemo (Doxil) until October '15. Scans were good, and I switched to Ibrance/Aromasin in Nov. with good results. In April '16 I developed neuropathy and started having trouble walking. This got worse and I went to the emergency room on May 27, fearing that the cancer was compressing my spinal cord again. Well, after countless scans and tests including a brain MRI, lumbar puncture, spinal MRI... you all know the drill... I was clear for cancer. So the neurologist has diagnosed me with CIDP, some weird disorder that I don't even understand. But he's not 100% sure this is the problem. Still, I've had four IVIG treatments for this with no improvement so far. In fact I think I'm worse! I can barely walk even with a walker, I have to lay down after the simplest tasks, and I haven't driven or hardly left the house since early June. I'm flat out miserable. This is not quality of life!!! All the while I'm convinced that the Ibrance/Aromasin is the culprit, despite my oncologist's denial. She briefly took me off both drugs before I was diagnosed with CIDP, with no improvement so I'm back on both. The Aromasin seems to cripple me even more with severe joint pain. I'm thinking about quitting both drugs and maybe going on a milder anti-hormonal to give my body a break. Any ideas what might be tolerable? What would you do?

In January I developed some cording and mild lymphedema. I have been stretching every day and just recently it seems to have improved.

So like you, I'm not sure if I should be wearing one or not. Maybe the cording/lymphedema developed because of my first flight? And could a sleeve do more damage than good, as you mentioned?

Of course, we're all different and who knows how we'll respond? I'm only saying that Doxil isn't the end-all-be-all. Speaking of quality of life, I'd kill for a pizza myself. A Roundtable pepperoni.

I struggle with this, and it makes me so angry that we have to battle this along with the stupid cancer! Grrrrr... But, as I said in another thread, it's important to spoil yourself. Is there something that you've always wanted to do, but you're putting it off because of the cancer? I'm trying very hard not to block myself these days, and think like a healthy person. I recently had progression, and I know I'm in for more radiation at some point this year, but right now I'm more concerned about planning a late summer trip! Grab it while you can, MusicLover. Sending you love! Rose. ",

My diagnosis was the same as your wife's, with mets to bones and liver. I also was on the same Xeloda/Avastin combo, and it worked extremely well for me. They were talking about pulling the drug in the US right before I finished treatment, and it made me nervous! All of my tumors were reduced by half and/or eliminated with Xeloda/Avastin, and I am currently in remission (since Jan. 2011). Of course, we all react differently to these drugs, but I certainly hope that your wife has excellent results! One thing you might keep in mind with Xeloda... I was on the 14 day on/7 day off cycle too, but others have been on a 7/7 cycle, and the side effects weren't as difficult. You might ask the doctor about this. I wish you and your wife all the very best! Please let us know how she is doing. Rose.",

I lost my own Mom early on, and I think the pain of having a child (particularly a young child) and Stage IV cancer would be too much for me to bear. The young mothers here are truly the courageous and strong among us. Also, I've never heard of breast cancer being linked with childlessness. Of course there has been speculation, but they speculate about nearly everything with cancer. I send you love, and wish you peace.

She told me to keep on moving, that it would go away! Ugh. A week later, I was diagnosed with Stage IV. Lynette, it's so hard in the beginning. Those hot flashes freaked me out so much... I thought I was going to pass out! But somehow our bodies adjust. The fatigue is crushing sometimes too, but we keep going. You will work through this! This is a wonderful, supportive group.

When the doctors learned of my family history, they strongly recommended ovary removal. And I did have my ovaries removed when they removed my breast tumor. Honestly, it wasn't a terrible operation and I recovered quickly. The early menopause isn't fun, but neither is cancer! Because I was diagnosed at Stage IV, I really didn't have much time to worry about my ovaries because there were much bigger issues. I never struggled with the decision because it was simply necessary in my mind. I'm so glad that your cancer was caught early but I do understand that it makes your decisions more complicated. You were just diagnosed... so take a deep breath... and do lots of research! This website is a wonderful place to gather information. Don't let the doctors talk you into anything you're not comfortable with!!!! You'll make an informed decision and that decision will be yours. Wishing you all the best! Rose. ",

I dread bedtime, because I'm so uncomfortable laying down. The pain seems worse at night.  I've had an MRI, CT scan, and bone scan that showed some edema in the back and ribs, but nothing is visible to me. I had surgery for spinal mets in 2010, followed by radiation, and a breast reduction on the right side after a lumpectomy on my left breast, also in 2010. Two or three nodes were removed. I wonder if anyone else has experienced breast or truncal lymphedema on the opposite side of the effected breast? I seem to have many of the symptoms... a burning, tingling sensation, fullness and pain in the breast, ribs, and back... of course, I feared more mets but the edema was the only thing that showed up on the scans. I think it may be time to get a referral for lymphedema? Does anything help with this pain? Thank you for any input! Rose.  Dx 1/22/2010, IDC, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

What other s.e's are you having? Also, keep in mind that Arimidex takes awhile to kick in... hopefully regression is in your near future!  I hope you're able to combat the side effects. We all react so differently to these drugs. Rose.",

I had radiation to my T4/T5 spine, and although I haven't been diagnosed with Transverse myelitis, I've suffered some neuropathy and a lot of pain issues from the radiation. I think a neurologist would best be able to assess your condition, so good for you for pushing! In my case, physical therapy and exercising has helped. I hope you see some improvement soon. I know how frustrating it is to not be as active as we'd like to be. Wishing you the best! Rose.",

I spent one night in the hospital. I felt some discomfort in the liver area for a week or so after the procedure but NOTHING compared to my spinal surgery or your resection! I did get sick on the morphine but that's me. And I freaked out when they wanted an x-ray the morning after. Turns out they were checking my lungs to be sure there was no puncture from the ablation but... ****! The worst part really was the morphine and my sleepless night. I was so disgusted with hospitals at that point that I made an angry exit up a flight of stairs on my own feet, ablated liver and all! I'm prepared to do RFA again and again if possible. Grrrr... They always like to shrink with chemo first it seems. I hope Halaven zaps it quickly on it's own so you don't have to bother with RFA. I do understand your fatigue concerns... I battle that too.

You've received some very thoughtful and honest responses in return! I only want to add that I've watched two loved ones die of cancer and not for one second did I wish that they'd just quit so it would be easier for me. I always wished for one more day, one more week... Very selfish of me because in my Dad's case, the treatments were getting worse than the disease. He fought to the end. I'm not sure what I'll do when that time comes, but I'd like the option to throw in the towel if I feel like it. It's a personal decision and one that should be honored. I hope you're in better spirits today. Remember that every day with your family is a memory for them. They undoubtedly love you very, very much. Rose.",

Of course, it's a minor thing on the mets scale, but the visual reminder isn't fun! I don't know much about skin mets, but mine look like small blisters. As Padiddle said, there are different types of skin mets. I hope that yours don't cause too much discomfort, and that they will disappear with treatment! Padiddle, I've tried over-the-counter pain meds, but they don't seem to touch the rib pain. I may ask for an x-ray, even though I just had a CT scan! Between the skin mets, \"radiation recall,\" and rib pain... well, more questions than answers, and it's making me a bit crazy. Plus, I'm sitting up to sleep at night because of the ribs. I'm with you on the narcotics... I'd like to save the big guns for when I really need them. Hope you find some relief and soon! MDtoMom, Happy that radiation worked on your skin mets! Hopefully they will never return! I noticed that you are diagnosed with IBC. I suspected I might have IBC before my biopsy showed the same pathology as my original diagnosis. There are differences between IBC and skin mets, but sometimes it's hard to tell (at least for me!). I wish you the best! I do realize that skin mets are a minor concern in the big, stage iv picture, but thank you all for keeping this thread alive! As I've said before, without you amazing ladies I'd be so lost!

I'm just wondering who here has been diagnosed with breast/truncal lymphedema, and what your symptoms were? I seem to have a lot of the lymphedema symptoms, but I also wonder if my back is acting up again, and they just can't see it on the scans yet? Or maybe trauma from my surgeries? The pain can be pretty intense sometimes! Now the doctor has ordered an ultrasound to check for breast lymphedema. I can't handle a mammo because of the pain. UGH!!!! It never ends!!!

The oncologist just called with the preliminary results... breast cancer of course:( She says it appears low grade, \"indolent,\" and she set me up with the radiologist for a consultation. I've also developed a sunburn like area over the sternum (I had my sternum radiated in 2010), that could be \"radiation recall\" and may or may not be related to the new mets. I'm waiting to hear the exact pathology of the new mets, but it sounds like my original diagnosis.  My question is has anyone had anything similar? Were you treated with radiation for skin mets? If so, how many rounds did you have? And I'm concerned that the skin mets may be an indication of something else going on inside. Ugh. Any thoughts on this? The oncologist has moved up my next scan to a month from now, after the rads, but I'm wondering if I shouldn't be scanned sooner.

I've had lots of loss in December that I associate with this time of year. But I've also been having a lot of pain in my back and ribs, which has been going on for awhile, and my doctor feels is nerve damage from spinal surgery and rads combined with the Arimidex/Faslodex combo I'm on. I sure hope she's right! Anyway, any good thoughts and energy tomorrow is most welcome. I'm usually pretty cool about scans, but not so much this time!

This is very precious time, and I blame your medical team for this mess. It is very, very wise of you to start again with a new doctor!!!! At Stage IV you need someone who is determined to fight with and for you and who will stay on top of EVERYTHING.  I am sorry that your son had a hateful reaction to your news, but hate is fear as far as I'm concerned. And although his reaction must sadden you, I am certain that he must be very afraid. Give all of your kids time to let this news sink in. It takes awhile to process, as you know. I hope you are able to rest and regroup... we are all here for you! xoxo Rose.  ",

I had a very similar situation with my spine at T-4/T-5 and in my case I couldn't walk and had to have surgery. Is your Mom a candidate for surgery? It can be a tricky situation, given the close proximity to the spinal cord. I had rads too, which helped me so much. I'm glad that your Mom isn't experiencing too much pain in her back... amazing! I also had a liver tumor but no jaundice. I do know that the liver is very tough and it takes a lot to shut it down. I hope that her treatments will be very effective and that your Mom will be feeling better soon. You sound like a wonderful daughter... your positive presence will be very comforting! Please keep us posted! Love to you... Rose.",
