The pain started on a Friday afternoon, and the next morning he started running a low grade fever, and feeling nauseated. That's when I told him it seemed more like a stone, because I have seen it before. Long ago I was working on a urology unit, when I first became an RN. It can be serious, as obstruction can cause sepsis and kidney damage. If you went to the ER in terrible pain, would they not do a workup to at least get the dx? My husband was diagnosed in the ER with the u/a and CT. He was given Toradol IV, which works very well for stone pain, and got almost immediate relief. He had a lithotripsy yhat Monday to break up the stone, and then it was passed over the next week or so.",

The same pain you described happened to my DH a few years ago, but he thought it was another slipped disc, as he has that history. I wanted to take him to ER, but he was too stubborn, of course, he's a man, after all. 36 hours of agony later, he let me take him in, and the doctor there immediately ordered a urinanalysis which showed micrscopic red blood cells. That sent him for CT which showed huge, 8mm kidney stone. He has had no further trouble since his lithotripsy, but has to drink lots of water to prevent another stone. Best to you, and may you soon be pain free!",

Lab techs do run tests, such as pap smears, bloodwork, urines, and others, but pathologists who are MD's do the biopsies. They look at the slides, determine what they show, and then dictate the report. Sometimes they also speak to our doctors, but they almost never talk to patients. Mostly, they would not be the appropriate one because they are not treating us, and not prepared to discuss treament of any kind. So I guess that could be frustrating to some, but maybe for the best because we would then have to wait to talk to our oncologists about tx, and waiting is sometimes the hardest part!",

The reason is that, depending on your circumstances such as other symptoms, they might want you to have blood drawn for cultures.

My onc wanted me to have a muga scan for the heart, and a bone scan, so she gave me those orderes, along with an order for a \"cranial prosthesis\", which is, of course, the wig. Insurance requires the order to be written, and my insurance reimbursed 70% of cost. Muga scan needed if adriamycin is indicated in chemo mix.

Caroline has a good idea about the notebook and questions. Jot down things you want to ask, and bring the list to your appointment. Most oncs will also give you some written material about se's and such. They know there is a lot to remember. I am an RN, and so I did sometimes care for people with cancer, and my Mom had bc, so I was pretty familiar with the routine. My DH always came with me, and he had questions though he is a physician himself. He does orthopedic surgery, not cancer care. I met with two oncologists just to get their opinions. They check heart and lungs, and do a detailed breast and node check. They also usually tap on the spine all the way down, checking for tender spots. They would check any other body parts where you might have issues gleaned from the history. I now feel like more people have seen my boobs than if I starred in x rated movies! I ended up choosing the oncologist who wanted to do the most agressive tx, and her reason was the \"large tumor size.\" The first onc said three months of chemo, using two drugs. She wanted to do six months of chemo, using three different drugs. When I asked why, she responded the above, so I went with that. She also commented that it was the tx she would want in my shoes. I did not have a Pet scan, nor any CT scans because of the lack of lymph or vascular invasion. I feel like I'm rambling, so I hope this makes sense to you. Come back and tell us how your visit goes. We are all here, wishing you well. ",

Large group policies for employees and dependents often don't deny for pre-existings because they have large pools of members that balance them out.

They returned and fell out again six times after chemo ended, and I was told that is not uncommon. Other women on this site have mentioned it too, and it is not something the doctors routinely bring up. I wish they would so that you could be prepared! I'm sure yours will settle in soon. Hugs",

We have struggled to pay for my insurance, and though my DH enjoys working, and is still well, he is 71. I stopped working in my thirties, and raised our three children, so going back after being dx with bc, and being 60, just wasn't doable. I feel guilty, because I know my husband feels like he can't retire until I am on Medicare, because my insurance is so expensive. My heart goes out to all the women who are too young to be dealing with this. I'm planning on being around to wish you a happy 65th! Hugs, Pat",

I am aware that I have a lifetime limit on my insurance, but I will be 64 in May, so one more year before Medicare for me. I've been lucky so far, and finished tx in 2006. My DH can't wait for me to have Medicare, because my insurance is so expensive!  If you qualify for Medicare, they pay 80%, and then you need a supplement which you buy separately, and that pays the other 20%. My DH is 71, and has been on Medicare since he was 65. The supplement is much less expensive than other policies have been, and they don't refuse you for pre-existings as far as I know. Make sure you look at different policies, because some are better that others. There are some like HMO's, which are not as good as others. Give them a call, and I hope they can help you. Best of luck, Pat",

People drive to their own chemo and rads treatments all the time. Hospital won't let you drive after surgery, and possibly local American Cancer Society could help. Aso, the hospital social workers may have ideas, or even your surgeon's office. Some hospitals have transportation services because many people can't drive to tests and procedures. A little investigation will probably bring a solution. Otherwise, remember you are not alone in this as long as we are here on this board! You are right about the stages we go through at DX. We've all been there, and you can come here to vent any time. We get it, and there are always women here ready with wonderful words of support and caring. Hang in there, you can do it! Pat",

I hope you are enjoying this special day, and don't be too hard on your self. You are a shining example of motherhood, and your doc sounds a little clueless to me.   ",

That said, we are always entitled to a copy of the actual report rather than just the routine letter. Many places do not offer it, but will give it to you when you ask for it. It's a good idea to do that. Radiologists are MDs, and they can do some biopsies, or a surgeon can do it. The pathologist, also an MD, determines whether the tissue is benign or not. he then sends his report to the radiologist or surgeon, whoever did the biopsy. Often the docs share reports with our other doctors, such as gyn or pcp. It's a good idea for us to request a copy of the path report too, whatever it says. Surgeons always look at the films themselves, and never would go by just the radiology report. That is the only addition I have to what Otter said, and she gave a very good summary of a confusing process. In the age of digital mammos, my surgeon pulls up my films on the computer in her office, and goes over them with me. If you are still concerned after you talk to the radiologist, a consultation with a surgeon would be the next step if your insurance allows that. If not, and your gyn ordered the mammo, then you could ask him or her for a referral to a surgeon. It's worth it to have peace of mind. Best to you, smerf",

Right now you do not have to have a primary's referral to see a specialist, and that is wonderful. DH had to apply about 3 months in advance, and Medicare kicked in on the first day of his birthday month. It happens to be Dec 24th, so Medicare started Dec 1st. He did get a letter from his insurance company reminding him that he needed to apply, because they would not be covering him after 65. Don't know if they all do that. Read the fine print on the supplement, so that you get the best one for your needs. There are so many drug plans available, and it was so hard to go through them, so we asked our pharmacist which one to go with, and took his advice.",
