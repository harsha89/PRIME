    "Content": "MLMClive wrote: I was diagnosed last Friday after a needle biopsy. I have had this lump for over a year but last year in ultrasound it appeared to be a fluid filled cyst. Last week, it showed up as solid in my annual mammogram/ultrasound. Biopsy confirmed that it's cancer. I am married with an 8 year old son. Those of you with kids, what advice can you give about what to tell a child about what is going on. I have been holding it together in front of him. For the most part, I am doing ok (I have reached out for a lot of help and joined a support group, I have faith so I believe in God's plan). But there is a part of me that is terrified. Sometimes it feels like a bad dream that I am trying like heck to wake up from. I wake up at night and feel so afraid and alone. It's hard for me to think about anything else. It's hard for me to function at work. I have another 2 weeks before surgery and need to stay positive. Any ideas? I welcome your support. Thanks!
