He told me the same thing we were thinking. It is just a thickening area on that part of the scar. He said something about maybe there was still a stitch there underneath that had not dissolved yet. I wouldn't think so 3 months later. I was just glad that I don't have to worry about it. I guess I need to put this in another conversation but since i am here so i will write it down in this spot and then maybe in one of the others too. He would like to see me go on Tomoxifican to lower by BC risk since I am estrogen positive. Ever since my diagnosis of LCIS I have been fighting this fight of going on this drug since then. I do not have BC in my family ( I realize that i can still get it, and i am just so worried about going on the drug and the side effects. I am 47 years old, and my periods are still very regular. For a month after surgery I was on these sites every day 3 -4 times a day finding out more info. This is a fantastic site!!! Everyone seems so friendly. Anyway I have gone through everything in my mind, bilateral mastectomy, drugs, no drugs and go in for check ups every 3 months. They only found it in 1 tiny spot and they biopsied lots of areas. Do all or any of you think it is really important? I know I just need to try it to see if I get any SE and go from there. He said i can always stop it if I don't like how it makes me feel. Yes but I am also worried about the possibility of stroke, aneurysm etc. Thanks",

Of course with this I have quite scar but with 100 stitches put in I wouldn't of expected anything less, however my Dr did an AMAZING job and I am thrilled with results!! Anyway I just noticed that their is a slight bump right over one part of the scar, husband thinks it is just a thickening of that part of the scar. You can hardly feel it, but it has me freaked!! Husband said that it doesn't feel like a lump at all but I am still worried. One reason I am freaked is after my surgery the tissue of course was sent to Pathology and they saw that I had LCIS. They checked many many other parts of the tissue and luckily they didn't find it anywhere else. YEAH!!!However now until I have my 3 month check up with my Oncologist (in a few weeks) I am going to worry. Do you think it is ok, is it possible that it can just be a thickening over the scar? Thanks for ahead of time for advicing. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Jun 29, 2008 08:08PM - edited Jun 29, 2008 08:10PM by 62192 Jessica  Wanted to let you know that I have 3 kids and I nursed my 3rd for a year and a half.  When I was 3/4 the way through with nursing I found a lump near my L nipple.  I freaked out!!! I went in, they did a mammo and it came back inclusive. They then decided to do a biopsy and that came back inclusive too but no cancer.They said the same thing that their are so many changes due to nursing and it can take months for our boobies to go back to normal.  That lump stayed around after nursing for a while then it slowly got smaller and smaller until 1 day it was gone.  So basically I am saying that yes it could mean something but chances are good that since your kids are soo young and you have been nursing that this lump could easily turn out to be nothing. My  child is now 8 and it has never returned.    I joined this forum in jan of this year when i had optional breast reduction surgery and when they tested the b tissue they found LCIS ( a pre-cancer condition). I now have to have mammos,MRIs more often. I have found tremendous support with everyone here about this.  I do not have cancer but a pre-condition that puts me at a higher risk of getting it.  Keep in touch with all of us.",

      "Content": "62192 wrote: I have been on this forum before and everyone seems to be sooo supportive. Right now I am really nervous about something. I am having to do a mammogram in a few weeks after having breast reduction surgery and them finding LCIS in 1 breast. So now I am going in for my 6 month check up and having to do a baseline all over again. I am 47 years old, diagnosed with LCIS, pre-menopausal and have been trying to get myself to try the tomox (dr wants me to, but I have worried about it). So now I am like starting to feel really panicky over this mammogram- what if they find something???? I am so freaked out about it everytime I think about it. I know I need to think positively but sometimes I am one that looks at the glass half empty. The dr told me a month ago to schedule the mammo for end of June. Well I did not schedule it until today and they got me in in 2 weeks, had a few cancellations. So basically I was putting it off and not schedulling it because of worry. i start thinking about the fact that i have 3 kids under the age of 13 and what would they do without me. i know i am taking this too far when we don't even know anything. This whole thing has been a lot for me to swallow, however it certainly has helped to have so many other people out there going through the same thing and more and hear how they are dealing with it.

      "Content": "Jan 28, 2009 10:34PM - edited Jan 28, 2009 10:35PM by 62192 Jan - I know how you feel about the tomox. Last January I finally got up the courage to do a breast reduction surgery that I have been wanting to do for quite some time. Anyway 2 weeks later I got the pathology report back after they analyzed the tissue that they removed. It showed that I had LCIS and ALH in 1 breast. Thankfully after they decided to do more tests to see if it was anywhere else, it was not! I did go 2 different Oncologists and breast surgeon. Both Oncologist recommended that I take Tomox and the surgeon said he didn't think the benefits would outweigh the risks. I am 48 years old, with no bc history. I have 3 children who are 14, 12 and 8 years old so I can relate to how you feel about the drug. I do go and have a mammo every 6 months and see the Oncologists every 3 months for a check up. If I want I can have an ultrasound too but my breasts are not nearly as dense as they used to be because of all the tissue removed. I probably will have US next time though. I still think about going on the tomox from time to time, but I think knowing me like i do, I would be more of a wreck worrying about the SE. I know many people are on it all the time and do fine, I just think it is your individual decision.",

      "Content": "Jun 13, 2008 11:13PM - edited Jun 13, 2008 11:16PM by 62192 Thank you so much for the reassurance. It always helps to hear other people dealing with the same thing and what they do to overcome it. Yes, faith is a part of my life as well and it has helped me tremendously at times and then when friends pray as well. I like the saying that the gentlemen told you. I have been a little more relaxed about this the last few days because my kids last day of school was today and it has been a crazy week and it kept me preoccupied. Now that school is done I am already worrying more about it, and i don't want the kids to see me really worried.One thing i have thought about is that if their was something it would be caught early - that is big help for me. I really should just try this tomox and see if and what SE's I get. I can handle hot flashes, it's the others I have read that worry me. I feel fortunate that I do not have family history but now I will have to be concerned about my 2 daughters - they are still young yet 11 and 8. To be honest I have thought quite a bit about the idea of a bilateral mastectomy - then I wouldn't have to worry about it at all. I am not rushing into anything though. Thanks for responding to me.",
