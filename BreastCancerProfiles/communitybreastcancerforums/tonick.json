The bloody discharge lasted for some days (possibly a week or longer, hard to remember) and then it just became clear discharge from then on. This discharge was completely spontaneous, although if I squeezed my breast it would force it out more, so it is possible that it was coming out throughout the day when my breast was being rubbed against by daily activity. Discovering this discharge made me curious if I had any lumps, so after self-examination, I found a bump near the duct where it was discharging. I went to the doctor and she reassured me that everything felt completely normal and she even squeezed out all the blood she could and took a sample of the bloody discharge to send out to the lab- which eventually came back normal. During that week when the discharge was bloody, I felt like my breast had extra pressure and sensitive to touch, and then after she pretty much popped it, all the pressure and pain went away. I wasn't settled after that visit, so about 1 year later during my routine checkup, they decided to send me for an ultrasound- which concluded that it was just an enlarged milk duct that was completely normal. I asked if there was anything more they could do to assure that it was definitely nothing to worry about, and they kept reassuring me that it is completely normal and at my age, it really isn't necessary for more testing as the ultrasound and lab results are enough for them to know what it is. Well, here I am 2 years later, due again for my annual pap smear and checkup, and freaking out because this is still an ongoing issue. I am just so nervous because I've read on so many websites that unilateral, spontaneous, clear discharge is, more often than not, abnormal. It isn't discharging as often as I used to notice, and it seems like it happens near menstruation time. However, it is totally possible that it's going on all month long and I just don't even notice it, because, after all, it is clear. I just don't understand how having consistent discharge can just be deemed normal. Why would it be happening? Is it like some kind of hormonal change because I'm nearing prime reproductive age? Is this something that will eventually turn into cancer? Should I have annual preventative testing? Will this affect breast feeding in the future? Should I insist on getting the duct removed? Why aren't my doctors more concerned? Should I be more pushy? Yes so many questions, but I'm only 24 years old and this has been going on since I was 22 (as far as I know) so I am just a huge ball of worry all the time :( Log in to post a reply",
