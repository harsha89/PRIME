The doctors removed three nodes and two of them also had cancer and she was stage three. We decided to go totally alternative, no chemo or radiation. We started in an alternative hospital in Mexico and was living there for a month. We have been at home now for over a year from those treatments. The local doctors cannot find any cancers nor lump/bumps. She had her blood tests this week and her CA 15-3 test came back at 16. We have been using several natural treatments at home and are hopeful that she has beat this.",
