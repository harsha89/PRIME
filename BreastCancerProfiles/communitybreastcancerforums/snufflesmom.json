I've taken levoxyl since 96 or 97,  with Hashimotos' it is not really the TSH hormone that is going up and down, your thyroid is destroying it self,  ( you son must have had a large amount of antiboides, that is how the disease is detected) and causing it so sometime go hypo or hyper, I just had tsh test done over the years and it has been pretty managable.  No real issue.  After BC I knew I had to deal with it again.  When the doc did my body scan to see if my BC was any where else in the body they said my thyroid was lite up.  So time to take it out, no need for it. I'm ready to have it done.  I hope it is B9 but if not, I beat BC I can beat TC. I wish your son well. Randi",
