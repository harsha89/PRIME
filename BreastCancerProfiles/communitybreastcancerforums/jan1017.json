I have a family history of Colon Cancer in my family(Father and Grandmother(Dad's Mom) and Uncle. I am 58 yrs old and have had 2 Colonoscopies in the last 5 years. Both were negative but I will be having one again in 2015. Personally the \"worst\" part of the colonoscopy is the prep the day before. The proceudre itself is not bad. I had \"twilight sleep\" so I son't remember past the meds. :) So don't let the fear of it stop you because the benefit is well worth it. Both my Dad and Grandmother died of colon cancer and my Uncle.  I intend to take advantage of the strides they have made in this medical field. My prayers are with you for good results.  :)",
