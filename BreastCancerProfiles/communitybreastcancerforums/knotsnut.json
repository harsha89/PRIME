Food is not tasting good, lump in my throat at all times and headaches.  Then there is the constant hot flashes.  And I have to look forward to this for the next 5 months, then radiation?   I will try to be upbeat next time.  Sorry",

I knew it was coming since the pubics started the day before but I cried and and still am teary.   Couldn't sleep much either.  I go to Goshen Cancer Center and they have many good departments.  They treat the mind and body.  The homeopathy nurse is changing many of my otc vitamins and supplements.  I'm hoping they will help. I also went the the local American Cancer Center, they have many good programs.  If you are under double poverty level, they will pay up $500 a year in medical bills, and also up to $300 in driving/miles per year. Many support groups, medical supplies, wigs, hats, books, bras, prosthesis, and they are all on loan for those that are in need.  I already bought my hats, turbans and a wig. But it was nice to know.  I also signed up for a Look Good Feel Better class that helps with make up, wigs etc. Just writing this and reading blogs make me feel better. Now I must drink and do chores.  Have a ggod day all.  2 down 6 to go. ",
