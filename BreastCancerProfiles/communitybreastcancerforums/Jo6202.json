Usually the boys are going to wife's family and stepdaughter goes to her mom's. I guess my having cancer has made my boys realize they need to spend some time with me. My one son set this whole get together up without any prompting from me. One good thing to come out of this mess. It may be only this year but I will take what I can get!

Once the swelling and Seroma went away ....ugly puckering and realized a quarter of my breast was gone. I do not have a PS yet because RO said my breast may shrink from the radiation. Once everything is done and everything has settled to where it is going to be then will see what a PS can do for me. I was a dd so have extra they could use from my good girl. Lili when I talked with surgeon she thought a lumpectomy was very doable but once she got to my tumor against my chest wall she found a second tumor right next to it that had to come out. It never showed on mammogram or US. Then the re-excision took even more tissue out. I guess at the initial consultation she just had no idea that I have always been a challenging patient. My PCP calls me her mystery patient and she says you never want to be a mystery patient! Every surgery I have ever had has had unexpected surprises. I won't bore you with undiagnosed illnesses, pregnancies, etc but I never have common symptoms. My bc tumor showed on mammograms for past three years but did not look like cancer to radiologists. Never felt a lump but breast started having indentation because tumor was pulling on tissue on the other side of the breast so had biopsy on area that did not appear to be anything on mammogram. Then surprise the big \"C\".",

I hate looking for a new doctor and having to explain my issues to someone new. I'm still waiting to see if I have to do chemo and if my body could handle it. Thursday will tell.

BS said it should not delay start of my radiation because she knows right where my one unclear margin is and will not have to disturb the other areas that are healing. If she doesn't get a clear margin in this spot this time then I will need a mastectomy. I have not met my RO yet so everything is subject to change depending on his opinion. Katlebbie, thanks for your kind words. I like your avatar, you have a little cutie there. School counselor, sounds like you have wonderful co-workers. Very touching that the one lady would cry with you. My SIL who is a survivor of 10 years told me on one of my very brave days that it was ok to cry.

I did not get clear margins so had second surgery Sept 11th. Then didn't like first MO who wouldn't give me copy of pathology report so wrote down what he was showing me and he said I didn't need to do that. Always had to wait at least two hours to see him and then he said my anemia was better by .2 but platelets down by.2 end of meeting. This was my first consult for bc with him. I had been seeing him for anemia prior to bc diagnosis. Never had blood pressure taken, weight check, never had an exam of any kind. Always met in his office. So I called and cancelled next appt. and said I wouldn't be back. Just starting with new female MO. I was so impressed with first meeting. Physical exam, all vitals checked, complete medical history of me and family gone through. Checked my Seroma, surgical scars, every little bump or bruise. She couldn't believe I have been anemic for three years so complete set of blood work done right on the spot. She is also a hematologist. She then ordered the oncotype test. She said to go ahead and do the simulation for radiation but then we need to wait until all the tests come back but I will be ready to go on with radiation if Oncotype and several other tests come back ok. The oncotype test should be back on Oct. 24th. July 2nd was my first visit about a change in my breast so to me this just has been so trying....I hate all this waiting.",

I go to see the surgeon this Friday. Not looking forward to more surgery and more waiting. I lost it at my primary care doctor's office when she said things seem to be going quickly for me. It has been two months of mental torture. So dr says she can give me meds for anxiety...don't want more meds just answers and a plan of action. Scouser47, No I didn't try the bras yet but hope to stop and get one after my appointment today. Liefie, thanks for the feel better words. I was scheduled for a lumpectomy and thought they would check for clear margins up to two times while I was still in the operating room. I was totally surprised to find out that I was closed up and had to wait 7 days to find out if the margins were clear. They are not clear so I meet with the surgeon today to discuss what to do now. It is currently 4 in the morning and I can't sleep because I'm thinking just go for the mastectomy and get done with it. Thinking of Dakota , Jackie and Trail. How are you doing? Nihahi, beautiful pictures. I live in Michigan but am an Arizona snowbird and I do miss the mountains. Hope I get to see them this year. I may be stuck here in the snow for the first time in many years if we don't get my treatment show on the road. Carlads, I am changing oncologist also. The first one said his printer was not working when I asked for a copy of my stereotactic biopsy. So I started to write down what I could see on his computer screen and he asked me what I was doing. I told him writing down the information and he said I didn't need to be doing that. RED FLAG warnings going off in my head!",

She had a reduction in the healthy breast then to match in size the radiated breast. My SIL is not happy with the reduction in her healthy breast because she still does not match in size although closer than two sizes difference. Her plastic surgeon told her \"this is not an exact science\". Would it be best to wait until after radiation to see if there are changes in size? Has anyone else had a reduction before or after radiation?",

They learned what a good father and a terrible father are like and chose to be like my hubby. Sorry you have to deal with a cockroach when you have so much to deal with now. What doesn't kill us will just make us stronger!",

Liefie, We usually go to Tucson in the winter and we can see the snow in the mountains and yet enjoy 70 to 80 degrees. Just love the mountains. Due to delays in my treatment we will be staying in Michigan for the first time in ten years. We sold our snow blower, shovels, boots, winter coats etc. years ago. We have not driven in snow, no longer have a four wheel drive vehicle....this will be an interesting winter. Forewarning everyone in Michigan to stay out of our path! :-). Hope it's like riding a bike and that it all comes back to us.",
