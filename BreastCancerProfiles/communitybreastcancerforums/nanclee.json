I found that Tylenol PM does help if you find you have trouble sleeping.  My thoughts are with you & everyone who is fighting this disease!",

What chemo drugs are you being given?  I had AC x 4, and had my first Taxol yesterday.  I hope all goes well..let me know how things are going.  Nancy",

Hoping this continues.   It has taken me a few months to come to grips with being bald..but I am kinda proud of it now.  My 12 yr-old son is still a little uncomfortable with it, but I guess that is understandable since he is just entering puberty and going through his own issues at the same time!  My co-workers/friends are throwing me a benefit on 11/22 and I'm feeling a little weird about it all...have any of you gone through this??  I work in a restaurant so many of my \"regulars\" are hearing about it, etc.  Any advice?? ",

I am curious to see when my hair will begin to grow back. It fell out almost completely in just 5 days beginning 12 days after my first AC treatment. ",
