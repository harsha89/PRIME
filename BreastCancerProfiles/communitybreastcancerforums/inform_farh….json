Drs have sent the samples to the lab for biopsi so probably that will make it clear how much chemotherapy she needs and what would be cycle details. Do you have any idea what would be effect of skipping or delaying one cycle of chemotherapy ? My mom has to travel to Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj and thats minimum for 21 days.",

We can't delay that religious activity as it (hajj) falls only once an year, and millions of people go there for this, its not easy or lucky enough to get selected each time, even more than 1 time in your life ! I will share the reports for sure. Thanks very much for reply.",

Further, Dr. is suggesting she needs to have chemo therapy and radiation as well ! I just wanted to confirm if she would be able to travel abroad after/ during these therapies or it makes you really weak that you can't even walk around properly ?",
