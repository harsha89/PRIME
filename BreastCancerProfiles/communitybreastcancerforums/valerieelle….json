      "Content": "valerieelle wrote: Hello everyone, My anxiety and fear have landed me on this page. I am 24 years old with a grandmother who had cancer at 70 and mom with no cancer. My breasts have always been lumpy but my left breast has developed a small pea sized lump to the right of the nipple. I have to press down very hard to find exactly where it is and cannot tell if it is attached to anything. To make a long story short, my doctor prescribed a core biopsy which I am terrified to have on Tuesday. He rated me between a 3 and a 4A on the BIRADS scale. What are the odds that this is something? I have been in panic mode and can't even enjoy the upcoming holiday. And furthermore, has anyone ever had a core biopsy done? Is it painful? I'm a wimp when It comes to pain; it's even difficult for me to get a blood test. Any sort of response will help. I truly feel for any woman who has to go through this. Thank you in advance.

I was expecting far worse but I didn't even cry! Closed my eyes and listened to christmas music the entire time to get my mind off of it. The entire procedure took about 10 minutes After , I spoke with my doctor who said the lump was hard but looked to him like a fibroandenoma or even less. He also made mention of it being a nodule but he says he thinks it's b9. I am praying it is. Results should come in about Monday or Tuesday and he said he wants to do a followup in 4 months. So all in all a good visit. Will be feeling 100% when i get a definite result. I will keep you all updated. Thank you all again for your responses and support.",

I know, I'm a chicken. But I'm just praying for the results to be b9 so that I can enjoy my holiday.",

I'll tell you one thing though- try to stay off the computer because the more you read, the worse you are. I feel like I want to be as educated as possible when something is wrong with me but it winds up causing a strain to my health because of the anxiety I have when I worry. My breast also is heavier and a bit larger than the other but from what the doctor tells me, that is normal and common. My advice to you is to stay on top of it. Do self exams while laying down or when you are in the shower. And if you are afraid that your doctor is missing something, get a second (or third!) opinion. You know your body best so if something does not feel right, make sure to get it checked. Have a very Merry Christmas and do not worry!! Enjoy your holiday!",
