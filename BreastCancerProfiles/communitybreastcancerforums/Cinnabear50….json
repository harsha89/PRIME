I've even had others, like my onc and my PT, remark what a great looking incision that I have!!  There are a lot of options out there as far as prosthetics and others forms you can use.  You've probably seen them discussed on the other topics.  Please try not to be anxious about this decision.  It's just like any other part of this journey that requires a decision--once you make it, move on and don't look back.  If it feels right for you then it is right regardless of what others may do or say.  You are going to be okay.  I will keep you in my prayers.  Hugs, Cinnabear",
