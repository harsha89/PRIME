Amazing how little so many MDs know about it. I've made the choice to wean him from the left side only for now. Righty has always been favored anyway ;) I got the cd of my images ready to bring to the BS tomorrow. This board is wonderfull for many reasons. I feel ready to advocate for myself in order to know for certain what this is. I will keep you in my thoughts as well. Scared-I will absolute update at the resolution of this, whatever it may be. I think it is important to let people know. Anamerty-I am sorry you are going through this and I so hope you have a good result. You may get more answers by posting a new thread with your questions.  I don't really know.",

Nothing worrying will change. I have an appt with a recommended (for skill and kind bedside manner!) breast surgeon this coming Tuesday and will see what she recommends. They said no mammogram because I am breastfeeding? hmmm, you may well be right about that radiologist. Well, the surgeon can order whatever imaging she thinks is necessary. I had been planning to wean anyway, this will just move up my timetable a bit as I'm reading that it would be much better for any biopsy or surgery. I just want whatever it is out. It is causing pain and awful anxiety.",

Difficult to describe, not sore or tender, more of a nerve type pain.  They found a cyst on my ultrasound but it is NOT where the palpable lump is. The tech was very patient and brought the radiologist in. Ultrasound shows nothing where I know there is something. I don't think my ob will hesitate to refer me to the breast surgeon. I'm pretty scared. Log in to post a reply",

Seems that the imaging department and I were across purposes with a maddeningly anxious outcome. The palpable lump was a simple cyst which she aspirated. Thank you everyone here.  and I wish you all well on your journeys.",
