So appetite hasn't yet left.  The steroids are making my face, neck and chest red so will be glad to end those tonight.  The chemo started a skin tich/tingle thing last night.  Trying to ignore it.  Not too bad.  Has anyone experienced this?  The doc said with these T/C tx the side effects usually begin 24 to 48 hours afterwards, but shouldn't be too bad or last too long.  Hoping he is correct.  :)  Angels how are you today?  Rockthebald, Eak, Familyroks, KristyAnn, Otter, and everyone else,,,,thinking of all of you!   Love to all!   Carla",

Mom's day sucked (and I never use that word) but it did.  Haven't read all the moms'stories and I hope everyone's special day was better than mine.  As I stated in an earlier post, I was diagnosed in early February, my mom went into the hospital 3 days later and died March 7th.  She never knew I was sick.  Dad and I buried her March 11th, my bi lateral mastectomy was April 11th, and now Mom's day was May 11th...lol.  As negative as I am sounding, I'm really not.  I'm ok.  I know she is very much aware of what is happening and around me alot.  Last night I had a small melt down (we need those to bounce back) and my cats were All over me nudging and nibbling and meowing.  I knew it was mom letting me know she was there.  They are love kitties anyway, but not to that extent.  Anyway, enough said on that front.  I've missed you guys these past few days.  This week hasn't been too bad.  Had the bloodwork up yesterday.  White blood count was halved but the rest were fine.  So all is ok.  Getting ready for work so will say bye for now.  Everyone have a Great day.  I will check in later today.  Love to all!   Carla :) ",
