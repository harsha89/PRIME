Don't worry, you shouldn't have a problem and they go a lot faster than a core biopsy.  Once the wire is in place, it is usually secured by tape or gauze.  It has a hook at the end so it won't pull out.  You can't take any strong meds because you have to be awake to cooperate. And the reason some docs don't use the lidocaine is that they feel they are giving 2 needle sticks - 1 for the anesthesia and 1 for the wire placement.  Good luck, you'll be fine.",
