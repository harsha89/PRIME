My sister came down with it a couple months before me so I had a head start. I have lots of female cousins that have had it. All but one lived. My Aunt had it. She passed away. My sister and me? We are allergic to Chemo, and the \"other\" drip. I am taking the pills that chase the estrogen. I am not sure what my sister is doing right now. She refuesd to go to the Docs I pointed he to. Good Night!!!!",

Course, I will be 70 in a few more months and I am glad of \"less weight\" And some of my cloths fit better. My biggest problem was when my hair fell out. All at once!! Something I haven't seen, though there is 10 years worth of reading here. This breast cancer is the same as ovarian cancer. They cheer each other along. So if you have not had a total hysterectomy be sure to go see your GYN. This is a women's cancer. Men very seldom get it. But 'may' be able to pass it on to their daughters. We are not sure yet. I can't take either infusion so I take a pill twice a day. Anastrozole. I had both breast removed, I already had a hysterectomy and no sign of cancer in my lymph nodes. Well, time to go read a books. I love my Kindle!!",
