I've posted on a couple of other forums here already and am grateful for the information I've found. I hope it's okay that I post here too. I had a diagnostic mammo with ultrasound last week. A \"vague area of distortion\" appeared only in one mammogram view - nothing showed up on u/s or on any of the MANY other mammogram views they took. The radiologist recommended an MRI, which I've scheduled for Nov. 9. I'm concerned about the inconclusive results - has this ever happened to anyone else? Is it a good sign that only a vague distortion was found on one view, or should I still be concerned? The radiologist said she was concerned after seeing the one film, but after finding nothing else anywhere on mammo or u/s, she thinks it might be a \"summary artifact.\" I don't know, I'm still pretty scared. I've also been periodically feeling a burning sensation from deep in my breast. It's not sore to the touch on the outside, it's more like an internal stinging feeling. Sometimes it seems to radiate to my arm, sometimes it just sort of pulses heavily in my breast. It's hard to tell whether it's chest or breast pain, actually - it's deep inside. (I'm sure my stress level is not helping with this pain.) This has made me worried about IBC, even though I do not have any other symptoms, really. Any words of wisdom or suggestions for actions I can take prior to my MRI in a few weeks? I'd really appreciate the support. I'm starting to drive myself a little crazy. Log in to post a reply",

Didn't worry too much on Monday, but when I hadn't received a call by the afternoon, I did call to ask whether the results had been received. They said they had not. Yesterday, Tuesday, I called the office again, and they said they had still not received the report. They told me to call the radiology department where I did the MRI to see when they would be sent. Radiology told me they already sent the MRI results to the office back on FRIDAY. So not sure why the office was saying they didn't have them. It's Wednesday now. I called this morning to tell the office that they do in fact have the report and that I'd really like a call back so I can know the results. They said they would get the report in front of my dr. today and that she would call me back. I'm feeling a little bit exasperated, and not at all optimistic that I'll get a return call after all this. I don't want to annoy the receptionist, but I *really* need to know these results. Especially now that I know they've been sitting on them for a couple of days. I know they have many other patients, likely in much more serious situations, but I'm anxious too. Would it be rude to call back if I haven't heard anything by this afternoon? Or is it better etiquette to simply wait for the call, no matter how long they may take? I guess I'm just wondering how frequently I'm within my rights to follow up. Log in to post a reply",

It is great to hear about the details of the procedure in advance by women who have been through it.   (I should apologize, though, for reposting a question that I realized later has been addressed in many earlier posts - lots of MRI questions to look through! I should have checked before I posted.) I'm sort of at the point where I'm more scared of NOT knowing than actually knowing a result. Although, I'm obviously scared of the results, too. The waiting is truly awful, as I know everyone knows. All those what-ifs... I'm having my MRI done at a hospital that has a women's imaging center with a least a couple of breast radiologists who are dedicated exclusively to breast imaging. So at least I know I will be in good hands. Thank you very much for the words of wisdom, it really means a lot to me.",

I'm 31, no history of breast cancer, but I guess my drs. want to be extra careful. I am VERY nervous, feeling like tomorrow is THE day - what should I expect? Will the procedure be scary? Can my husband sit in the room with me? And above all, will I be able to get answers - or at least initial impressions - from a radiologist right away? Obviously I'm hoping for some finality tomorrow, and I'm just wondering how likely that is to happen. Or should I prepare for more waiting? Thanks again for all the helpful advice.

It was a little unnerving and loud, and my tech was pretty matter-of-fact, but I did ok. I was sort of hoping I'd get some sense of the results today, but I left without anyone really saying anything and I think it will be a couple of days before they get the results to my dr. I'm going to try to have a relaxing weekend; I know I've done everything I can so far. What happens after you get the MRI results? I'm assuming if they don't find anything, I'll need to follow up in 6 mo. or so - if they do find something abnormal, how is that described? I'd assume biopsy is recommended? Just trying to anticipate what I'll hear from my dr in both cases.  Thanks again for the support. Liz Mead",
