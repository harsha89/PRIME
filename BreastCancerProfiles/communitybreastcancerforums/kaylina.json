At 19 I understood it could be a lump and that could be a sign of breast cancer cause a friend was talking about this cancer. I decided to do nothing about it and talk to no one. Now I am 25 and because of work this year I used to sleep under 4-5 hours a day for 3 month in a row. And I was really stressed by the working atmosphere. After around 1 month with a disturbed sleep the lump grow bigger but I continue to work. Afterwards I read that sleep deprivation and shift work can increas breast cancer. Now I try to not sleep on my belly cause I feel pressure on the lump. Sleeping on my left side can be also unconfortable. I sleep quite a lot during the day too. I feel my body is kind of weak. I dont know if it is depression of a synptoms.I will not do as much sort as before or carry for a long time heavy thing with my left arm. Are these part of the untreated breast cancer synptoms? I just had a little red point appearing on my left breast few month ago. It didnt grow bigger since. I feel prt of the lump is kind of under the skin. Could it be a start of ductal carcinoma on my outter skin? I choose to do nothing 7 years ago. I even forgot about it with the time. But now that it seems to wake up I am just questionning what to expect next? which synptoms? and at which speed? I didnt find a lot of information on how goes untreated breast cancer. Thank you for your help. Sincerely, Kaylina Log in to post a reply",

I just enter the doctor building that I freaked out and get out. My heart beat just had a rush. I dont know. I usually always know what to do but here when it is about my health I kind of let it go. I can feel my lump without touching my breast since it had grow this year. It is like I have a heavy ball in my breast. My breast is kind of really warm and the muscle on the left of my neck are kind of tight. One last thing is that I am living in a university town. A medical university I am myself working there. which mean that whatever I do about my health even with medical privacy I am afraid that people around will end up knowing what happen to me. One last thing I want is that it become public you see. SO it even add to my fear. Maybe I should see a doctor in another city. could be a solution...",
