Usually, I have a problem coming out of it and all I want to do for the next day after my surgeries is sleep.  I have started to ask for a lighter anesthesia now. But during my Bilat Mastectomy, they gave me a pain block (instead of a pain pump that was originally prescribed) and all of the sudden everything went black and I started hallucinating.  They had to get me out of that and give me something else.  I only remember starting to again hear what they were saying and I could feel what they were doing, but I couldn't open my eyes.  Then they gave me something else and I don't remember anything until I woke up after the surgery.  According to my BS, when I was 45 minutes late for my surgery, she went to check on me and said I was out of it.  She thinks that they either gave me too much of the drug or I was really sensetive to it.  Either way, it was a wild and scary ride and I still remember it.  Since then I go with as light of anesthesia and I can.",

I decided to have a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction.  It wasn't an easy decision, especially since my husband only wanted me to have a unilateral.  He thought that you shouldn't get rid of something that didn't have anything wrong with it.  I understood that but this was me and how would I handle it if it came back in the other side?  I had been through a lot already. Besides having LCIS (giving me a higher risk of getting it in the other side), the deciding factor came when they found a suspicious lump in my good breast.  That overwhelming feeling of possibly having cancer in the other side and thinking about all I had already gone through is what helped make up my mind to have the bilateral. After a biopsy and then the mastectomy, they found that it wasn't cancer but I was fine with my decision. I have no regrets.  My reconstruction process is almost done.  I miss my real breasts but most days I don't even think about the fact that mine aren't real.  They look very real, especially in clothes.  My husband said they are almost too perfect and to look at me, nobody would know what all I went through.  I'm young yet and I have young children.  I needed to do what I can to be around the longest I possibly can and still have piece of mind.  Best wishes!",
