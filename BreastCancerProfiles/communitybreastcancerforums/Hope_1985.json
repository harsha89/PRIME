I have always has local recurrence after a bilateral mastectomy at the age of 24. Now I have been told after finding a lump under my arm, that my cancer has metastasized to the lymph nodes. After a biopsy, it was found I am ER-/PR- and HER2+. I have not chatted to my doctor yet and currently on no meds. Anyone experienced something similar? Any insight on what your treatment was? I am now 30. Log in to post a reply",
