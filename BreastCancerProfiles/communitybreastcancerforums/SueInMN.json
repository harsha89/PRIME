The good news was it came back no cancer; not so good news is they found abnormal cells and I need a surgical biopsy. They said it was to get a bigger sample and also to \"remove the whole thing\". Nurse who called with results said it was like a lumpectomy but would be a pretty small area. Have not actually received a copy of the pathology report. I'm back to being scared out of my mind. The big worry being they find cells that are cancer. But lots of smaller worries to distract me too: it is a small area but deep within the breast so I assume that makes it harder; how noticeable will the scar be or changes in the breast since they will remove tissue; I live alone but assume they will want someone with after the surgery--could stay at my sister's but have cats that need medication every day; how much time do I need off of work, how long is the recovery; how painful etc. etc. I think I am focusing on the details to avoid thinking too much about their finding cancer. Am trying to remind myself to not get ahead of the data---but my brain doesn't always cooperate. Have appt. 2/12 to consult with breast surgeon but hard not to think about the questions until then. Really appreciate all that I have read on this site. Helps me think about it constructively without burdening friends and family too much with my obsessive worries, Would love to hear insights or advice from anyone who has had this procedure!

Did find a second small questionable spot in right breast at 9 oclock. they will do an MRI guided biopsy later this week. Nurse said radiologist \"doesn't think malignancy' but if more ADH, they would remove at same time as originally planned excisional biopsy for small area with calcifications and ADH that is at 3 o'clock. She also said that if I wasn't already addressing the other area the recommendation would be redo MRI in 6 months, but that it is better to address it at one time. I know this is mostly not bad news and some definitely good news in there. The new area is small, if it is anything, I can do it in one surgery rather than another surgery in 6 months. And the left breast is clear in the MRI (yeah!). But I can't help feeling disappointed. I feel like my body is on a quest to try every kind of breast biopsy there is. I can't seem to remember what it is like not to feel stressed. Just want to cry sometimes. I know so many of us are going through the same feelings. Waiting. Another test. Wait some more. Appreciate everyone's stories so much. Sending good thoughts out to everyone. We are stronger than we think sometimes and will get through it all.",

I do sometimes forget to cut myself some slack and allow myself to just feel whatever i feel instead of trying to keep in control all the time. Three cats-am hoping you hear good news. That is wonderful that Komen was there to provide help. I feel very lucky to have good insurance. Hope you are healing well from the surgery. (btw--I would be 'twocats' and any typos I blame on their insistence in helping me at the computer!) Fenella--I hope you are able to get some resolution. I'm glad your tests so far showed no cancer but totally understand the frustration of not knowing more. ((hugs))",

Not sure what my question is--mostly just needed to write down the scarriness of it all.  Am trying to stay busy.  Have a dinner date on Saturday evening.  It's a relatively new relationship--do I have my timing down or what?  :-)  and I have a book club meeting on Sunday at my house no less.  Even when doing other things, though, I feel like my brain is still distracted by this whole journey. Any advice on getting through the last few days before the surgery would be appreciated.   Thnx, Sue Log in to post a reply",

Had dinner with some friends last night, including a woman who had surgery for a huge tumor on one of her kidneys--stage3 cancer. She is doing great (even brought a picture of what they removed--I do *not* plan on asking for pics from my surgery. lol). It put my situation in perspective for me though.

My results came back with no cancer, and if fact, no additional ADH (Yeah and big sigh of relief).  I meet with the breast surgeon in about a week and don't know if they will recommend anything beyond 6 month testing.  I am a few years older than you (51) and know that age makes a difference in what they recommend.  My breast surgeon originally mentioned drugs like tamoxifen to reduce the risk associated with the ADH finding.  But like you I have a lot of questions/qualms about that.  I am trying to follow Ariom's advice to not jump ahead.  I think the advice to \"slow down\" is the best advice I've gotten.  Even if the surgeon refers me to the oncologist and they suggest it, the decision doesn't need to be made right at that moment.  In fact that is the decision I've made---not to decide at the visit where it is recommended.  I know I will need the time to look into it more so I could feel comfortable with whatever decision is made. Hoping for good results for you! ",
