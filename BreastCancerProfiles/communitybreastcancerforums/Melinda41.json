Needed to find new primary care physician since my previous one was not on my insurance any longer. Had Mammogram on 9/11 and met surgeon and had biopsy on 9/17. Results should be back Tuesday and I have appt with surgeon on Thursday. So I am kinda hanging tight, read a little bit about the cancer possibilities until I start to tear up then I have do find something else to distract me. I have two daughters, I am divorced, have crappy insurance and real nervous about... well about everything. Surgery is defineately in my future, surgeon agrees that no matter what it is, it needs to come out. Surgeon said it looks like cancer on mammogram, which surprised me. When I asked for his gut feeling, I expected some polite brush off \"We can't make that deteremination until biopsy is done\" type of answer. I wasn't really expecting \"yeah, looks like cancer\". But, hey, I asked for his gut feeling. Right now, I am just feeling impatient, let's find out how bad this is going to get and get to work. I hope everyone is having a good weekend while we play the waiting game. melinda-musing.blogspot.com/ Dx 9/22/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 2, 9/19 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I will probably wait until after path reports as I am hoping I can tell them it is just a simple surgery with no long term affects (keeping fingers crossed for good report). I am outside Nashville, so I appreciate the suggestion for additional resources. Working was not quite a distracting as I was hoping, I jut feel dazed. The breast is less sore from the biopsy, the sleeping bra made me more comfortable, I have larger breast and the unbridled dangling was uncomfortable! I am hoping the doctor will call and give me results. I have follow up appt with him Thursday but if he gets results before then, I would love to know so I have a better idea of what I am working with so I can make a more informed decision.",

This morning, I was much less sore, did some shopping with the kids, bought some PJ pants and sleeping type bras, just in case. Well, the doc did say that it needed to come out regardless of what it is. Feeling OK today, thinking \"If I have to have cancer, at least it is in an \"optional\" part of my body, one that I can live without.\" I am not going to get bogged down with worse case scenario just yet.

I am not brave, I was minding my own business and cancer invaded my house. What the hell am I supposed to do, hide under the bed and let it burn the house down with me in it? I do wonder if the other diseases resent the BC awareness, and here we are bitching about it. Do we know what we would like to have happen? I don't think I would mind the \"exposure\" if they would just be a little more realistic about it. Where are the images of grandma taking care of the kids since Mommy is sick in the bed with chemo? Where are the realistic images of reconstruction or booblessness? I have never seen a BC ad which shows a woman with one saggy boob and the other boob up under her chin from a tissue expander. Thanks to the previous poster that mentioned Metastatic BC Day, I posted the article from the Huffington Post on my Facebook and no one acknowledged it. I imagine people think \"How could anyone die of BC, I thought you got treatment and then started running marathons and doing yoga?\" Truth in advertising, that is what I am asking for. When they are raising money for natural disasters, they don't show images of rainbows and unicorns. Think about hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, what images did they show to raise awareness?

This is my blog entry today (I just copied and pasted instead of doing the whole rant again). I am in a very crappy mood today, just angry, pissed off and tired of all this crap. First off, my morning TV line-up has changed so I have been watching \"The View\"....probably my mistake, I should know better. So today, Sherri and Elizabeth get mammograms. It is Elizabeth's first and Sherri's first in many years. Watching them whine about the pressure, the squeezing, the smooshing of the mammo just really pissed me off. If you can't handle 3 seconds of smoosh every couple of years (or whatever the CDC is recommending now), why even bother getting a mammo since IF you have cancer, three seconds of smoosh will be a freaking walk in the park. I am NOT saying don't get your mammo's, but please...please can we put this in perspective ladies. \"I had to get a mammo and it squished me\" wahhh wahh f*cking wahhh. It does not even register on the crappy day meter once you have had the bad mammogram and all the ensuing shit that goes with it. Suck it up, it is not about saving the boobs, squishing the boobs, getting new perky boobs....woman are dying. Your squishy little test is like a paper cut. BUT, there are people out there whose paper cut turned into gangrene, their hand fell off and it led to a systemic blood infection that killed them. (Man, I will be glad when Pinktober is over).",

The year after my divorce, I got obsessed with gardening. I discovered winter sowing of seed. I had maybe 180 jugs of seed on my back porch! I thought about doing that again this year, give me something to look forward to in spring. As my seedlings sprout, so shall I. I woke up with some nausea, too long in between compazines, I guess. I should have taken one when I woke up sweating like...a pig? Do pigs really sweat that much?? I was mildly dissapointed at chemo yesterday, they took blood from my arm (my good arm). I assumed they would use my port for all the sticking. I asked the nurse about it and she said it was their policy to do arm sticks. So when they do access my port for chemo, they comment on my great blood return and I am just thinking \"You could have used all that for the blood draw and saved me a stick\". I talked to the Onc to get more info, or maybe info that I had and forgot. After the 4 ACs, he will do another PET scan to see what is up with my subpectoral lymph node. After that, I will start on my Taxol x 12 with either Herceptin and/or the Tykerb depending on what study arm I get put in. It appears that no one is doing TX today, Cafelvr and Boxersue, I hope all went well with you yesterday.",

Out of curiousity, I did ask the kids if they would have gone to Wal-mart with mohawk Mom, YD paused but said yes, OD said No. I guess cool kids even have their limitations!

No, I did need smilies for the next year. Hopefully the rest of you will be gone and chemo will be a distant memory for you. Side effects from Herceptin: 1. Nausea and/or vomiting 2. Rash, itching (rare) 3. Mild to moderate chills, fever, pain, nausea, vomiting and headache. 4. Occasional diarrhea Cardiac dysfunction can occur.",

Speaking of eyeballs, the eye doctor finally discharged me after my weird eye accident (that I don't know how it happened). He told me to do 5 more days of steroid eyedrops and gave me some lube drops and said to keep doing those until the end of chemo since my eyes are so dry. They don't feel dry, but he said they are, so I will take his word for it. I have had some episodes of sleeping hand, I guess that is neuropathy from the Taxol, I hope it is not bad enough for them to change the plan. No weirdness in feet. I am surprised at people who think I shaved my head for fun. I have had several people surprised that I am doing chemo. That amuses me. I realize I look really good bald (lol), but I didn't know I put out a Sinead O'Conner vibe. There is nothing stylish about me, I can't believe that people actually think I am making a fashion statement. Yesterday, I was at a fast food place with the security cameras, my fuzz showed up nice and dark on the moniter, the kids laughed at me for looking at my nice fuzz. Today, the kids I babysit for informed me that although I do have a lot of fuzz, it is very gray. I like the camera better. Hope everyone is well.",

I got the blood drawn for the BRCA test yesterday. I would love a negative for my sister's and daughter's sake. If I am positive, I guess I'll start lopping off more parts, left boob, ovaries and such. I did read and my Onc confirmed that Her2+ is less likely to have the genetic component. I asked my Mom to let me talk to Onc alone yesterday, that was an awkward request for me to make. But I needed to have a state of the union meeting and wanted to talk nitty gritty cancer stuff. He said that he would give me a 75% chance of meeting my goal of surviving my daughter's childhood and that I shouldn't blow of retirement savings plan. Plan for the worse but prepare for the best, that I will still be around to be a crazy old lady. I am getting a decent little tax return and was wondering whether I should pay off credit card debt, or sock it in savings. If I am going to get worse, I need the savings. If I am going to get better, I need to get out of debt. I was thinking about the six month waiting period for ssdi to kick in. If that becomes neccesary, I would like to know I have the cushion. Apprarently, I qualify for SSDI now, which is a very depressing thought. But Onc said we are still thinking curative, not control. I will have another PET scan in between chemo and rads to make sure glowing lymph node has been extinguished. I see lymphedema therapist today for first treatment for my truncal issues. Looking forward to learning how to get rid of this side boob pork chop thing under my armpit. Hope everyone is well. Suepen: I am eager to hear what side effects you attribute to the H only.

I am studying my arm hair and the little hair is actually kinked. I never lost my arm hair, but it looks like the chemo fairy came in the night and gave me an arm hair perm. Checking pubes at desk... so my arm hair is kinky and my pubes are coming in straight. And, my big toe hair finally fell out! Oh, desk is at home, I am not in a cubicle checking my pubes, just for the record! I hope they call soon before I discover additional weirdness.",

But what if we get to goal weight and don't have the fat to spare? (A girl can dream, right?). I also wondered if we could use this time to increase our pecs and lats, so there is more muscle to spare? I already have an abdominal hernia left over from having kids, so I doubt I would be a candidate for the Tram Flappy thing, but I would like to have that hernia tucked back in while I am under. But I do have saddlebags to spare, they probably won't go anywhere, ever. They could slice each of those babies off and make at least a Bcup on each side. Too bad we can't \"bank\" our fat like you bank your blood. Take all this extra now, let me get back into shape and then thaw out that fat and slap it back on.

Mabelle: I won't meet my rads guy until after my scan. Hopefully you can get started soon, sorry they have to deflate you a bit. Sue: glad the physio gave you some relief Michelle: You gave me a scary visual of me out in the yard, all dressed expect for one saggy boob hanging out to get a tan. I am not sure my neighbors would appreciate me mowing in a one shouldered toga. Alicia: Your post make me smile, you are all done with boobs and chemo and all that, aren't you? Do you have any cancer related crap to do? Is your recon done or do you have to have more finishing touches?",

The lump is definitely new. He says it feel like a peanut M & M. (I wonder how they chart that description?). He said it could be scar tissue but he did have me do a CT scan while I was there. So, I feel good that it is a valid lump worthy of looking at (I hate feeling like a hypochondriac). I am glad he did not say \"wait and see\" but of course it scares me that he did the CT on the spot. I think I must be the most scanned person I know, I have honestly lost count of the PET and the CT and the \"with contrast\" and the Xrays. It seems highly unlikely that anything could be lurking in there that they don't know about. I guess I will know something soon enough. I'll be crocheting on Valium until then.",

After rads are done, it will be biopsied. Personally, I can't see them radiaiting the hell out of something that may be scar tissue, so I don't have a good feeling about it. I did feel sorry for the Rad Onc, he was having such a hard time trying to spit it out, you would think that they would be used to saying stuff like that.

I saw Rad Onc today, he is still concerned about Clyde and seemed pretty surprised that surgeon didn't remove it.  He is not buying pus filled abcess or nectrotic tissue theory. I see Big Onc tomorrow, I guess I need to just walk in with a list of pro's and con's for cutting it out. It seems like the big con is compromised wound healing. I run the risk of not healing if I have it removed. So it still may be cancer, but to find out for sure we wait for scan time or take it out and run the risk that I will have an open wound. (Rad nurse said she just had a patient that spent 53 days in hospital from wound that didn't heal after rads). But, it ain't cancer until someone says it is cancer.",

He also said the new squishy swollen area is just fluid from radiation making it worse and we will look at that again in a week. So , the  good news is is that he does not feel like Clyde is cancer. He did an ultrasound and stuck a needle in there. He couldn't get much out but I don't know what that means. So I will see him again next Friday and he will cut it out if it is still there. That means it will be gone soon one way or the other and I will be able to find out what the hell it is. For now, I am hurting from the needles and poking and prodding but emotionally, I feel good.",

Hmmmm, call me an idiot, but it makes no since that this could be \"surgical changes\". The \"opinion\" part clearly reads, \" suspicious for residual/recurrent carcinoma\". Ignorance was nice, I may have been growing cancer during chemo. I hope rads zapped the hell out of it. I wasn't going to have another scan soon, I was enjoying my mental space. I guess I'll tell Onc to go ahead and schedule it when I go back for my next herp. Clyde didn't pop up until after the June scan, he didn't show up until after rads started. So it doesn't seem likely that the scan picked up Clyde since Clyde is supposedly radiated fatty scar tissue bacon fat pork rinds shit. But....it ain't cancer until someone says cancer.",

There was a damn suture still in there. No matter it has been irritated. It is already looking better, the hole is closing up.

It appears that you are better at keeping medical records than the experts. I have had a lung crud that is taking a long time to shake. I went to my general doc and she said that \"my cilia is not perky anymore\". I said \"Hey, that is kinda personal!!\". Ha Ha, the cilia (hairy fingers in my lungs) are all radiated and crunchy so they are not as effective in fighting the lung crud. So I am the owner of a shiny new nebulizer, fancy inhalers, and a steroid dose pack. But I feel so much better already. I wonder if I will grow new perky cilia or if we are stuck with crunchy lung hair forever. Boy toy and I only see each other on weekends but it is going very well, very comfortable. He is going out of town this weekend, so I will have a chance to get caught up on my sleep and crocheting. He is cutting into my crochet time, productivity is waaay down...but it is worth it. Ha Ha",

I asked if my last scan looked like radiation changes to him and he does his weird face and says he'll talk to Big Onc. He seems determined to keep me worried. He also scheduled a mammo for next week of my one boob, no concerns, just getting me on a yearly schedule. You would think that the scans would be enough, but not for Dr. Poopy Head. His nurse did give me the copy of the last scan, changes could be radiation, could be tumor infiltration, blah blah. SUV numbers still hanging out less than 5, so that is good. I get the feeling my Docs play good cop (Big Onc), bad cop (rad onc) and comic relief (surgeon and his forgotten stitches). I want a nice NED scan too, damnit. Rad Onc said maybe one day I will get a clean scan, but this one still has question marks.Party Pooper meany head. So I will mammo next week, get my herp next week and that should be it for the rest of 2010.",

Also found out that chemo will be once every three weeks since my insurance won't pay for the Neulasta shot to keep the WBC counts up. It's not the cancer that will kill me, it is going to be the insurance. My brain just feels saturated with bad news. It is like I only digest a chunk at a time.

Livelife: Don't feel naive about the cost thing, who in their right mind would think that a shot of anything would cost that much! Apperently, cancer is a big money making business. SLV: my DDs are 10 and 12. About two weeks before chemo, I told them I wanted to get my hair cut short, that I wanted to \"transition\" to bald. They volunteered to go with me and watched me with these shocked looks on their faces (maybe I shouldn't have asked if they wanted to go with me). My 10yo wouldn't look at me for a couple of hours, but that was better by night fall. I went from shoulder length, full and curly, to 2 inches all over my head. I don't know whether I will involve them in the shaving that should happen next week. But I do feel confident that their reaction will be temporary. As for me: I ended up feeling pretty darn good, got called into work so I was able to make some $$. Ate like a pig, just keep snacking, went to Taco Bell after work, good stuff. I don't know why i am hyped up, it makes no sense that the steroids I had 6 days ago are affecting me. Or maybe this is \"normal\" me and I just forgot what \"I\" feel like.",

I had my first chemo 2 days before you and yes, everyday is a learning experience. I am starting to feel pretty good and that is even weird. My chemo book said to rinse mouth 4 times a day with hydrogen peroxide mixed half and half with water. I also bought some Biotene brand mouthwash (alcohol free) and I use that also (the hydrogen peroxide tastes nasty). I am not having taste issues often, just every once in a while, but I guess that is subject to change. I read something that said sniffing soap before you eat wakes up your olfactory senses and makes food taste better. So I will try that next time I get a big bite of cardboard. I did have a port put in, I hear the chemo really does a number on your veins. I don't love the port, it is right under my bra, but I am glad to have it so I don't look like a junkie with bruises and sticks all up my arms. But I am not on the thin side, so I can't help you there. My kids are 10 and 12, both girls and they seem to be pretty open with asking questions and they are pretty free about griping about the crappy parts of cancer. I am a single mom, so it's just the three of us and I really shoot for honesty. One thing I told them from the get go: If you have questions or overhear something that scares you, ask me, don't assume anything and be scared alone. When I told them this, my 10yo said \"OK, I heard you say 'die', Are you going to die\". I had to think what she might have heard and I realized she heard me talking about the node biopsy. I was so glad to be able to tell her that I was talking about DYE not DIE. Gilda's Club has support for kids, I haven't been yet, but the girls know there is a group we can go to if they want. You might want to see if there is a group in your area, just so you will have options. I am also doing AC x 4 every three weeks, and am two days ahead of you. So if you need a \"chemo buddy\", I am here.",

They didn't chip away at the outside of the asteroid to make it smaller, they stuck the nuclear sh!t in the middle and blew it up from the inside. If you want to penetrate enemy lines, do you start attacking at the edges or do you sneak spies into the core? That tumor is no longer a solid mass of dread, it is weak and mushy and chicken sh!t.

I have seen Cetaphil products at drug store and large groceries. We also use pure shea butter on our chapped lips, maybe that would help. Maybe this is too weird, but Crisco is also a good moistuizer for psorasis patients, if you get real dry and painful, that might be worth a try. Linda; that stinks! have you ever had diverticulitis before, doesn't seem fair to get new problems right now. Is this something you are going to always watch out for or is it just something that happened due to the low white blood cell count. Hope you get better real fast. Nette: Thanks for reminding me about the satin pillow case, I dug one out and used it, it was more comfortable on the pricklies. KayH: glad you are all baby bottom soft! I am too scared to try and shave my stubble on my head by myself. Isn't is funny... who would have thought six months ago that we would have been discussing painter's tape vs. lint rollers for removing pricklies from out balding heads. I don't know how long you all have been on this cancer train, but six months ago I had no knowledge of toxic pee and didn't even own one hat, much less a basketful to match anything I own. I went to work with my little doorag thing on, people got quiet when I walked in, anyone who didn't know I have cancer, well the jig is up now. Cheap Hat Tip: If you have \"Dollar Tree\" or one of those Anything is a Dollar stores near you, I have picked up lots of warm hats in all kinds of colors and they are 1.00 each. I also found a place called Rad Wrapz, I think it is Radwrapz.com and they have presewn doo rags in all kinds of patterns for about $5.00 each. They have a buy 3 get one free sale. I want to play hookey from chemo tomorrow, I don't want to feel bad again. Been there, done that, got the bald head, let's move on to something else. But my sister is going to hang out with me on my bad days, doing the single mom thing is tough when I feel like I can't take care of my responsibilities. Hope everyone has a great day!",

I shaved it but it is still not bald bald. Even my head hair is weird. I think I shaved about 10 days ago. I have stubble around the back and sides (I think it is still growing, I was balder last week) but the crown is still baby butt smooth. I just went and checked in the mirror ( that is such a wild sight when I really study it). I think I have hair still growing in little patches, I think I have more stubble than I did a week ago. But there are large shiny bald spots, real large and real shiny. Is everyone shiny bald or do some of you still have the rough stubble?

No more cushies and sports bras, no more foam forms that slide around on my chest. Plus I got the most un-sexy grandma bra to wear with it! They are going to order some less matronly bras for me to come in and try on. I have to admit, I cried a bit driving home with my foob. It just felt and looked so nice. Since my diagnosis, I have worked very hard trying to convince myself that boobs don't matter, hair doesn't matter, living to age 90 doesn't matter, etc. I feel like if I stop wanting these things (hair, boobs, health) then I will have more peace since I won't feel dissapointed. But the foob is great and I won't apologize to the cosmos for feeling superficial. Mabelle: Thanks for sharing about your TE. I wasn't able to get TEs at the time of my mastectomy due to insurance, no plastic surgeons in my area and the need for speed issues.

Feeling Ok today today after a terrible night of night sweats. My head just felt like it was in an oven. Today I need to go to a funeral home visitation, the service is tomorrow but day three is usually a stay in bed day for me. I gained 6 pounds in the three weeks in between chemos. That sucks. Before my diagnosis, I was doing weight watchers and lost 35 pounds. I am not paying attention to my diet at all now, just eating what tastes good, which I am going to hate myself for if I gain the weight back. But maybe it was just the holdiay cookies and I can hold steady now. I guess I will break down and shave my lower legs today, I kept hoping it would fall out, but I don't think I can wait any longer. Everytime I shave, I think \"maybe this will be the last time\", but alas, still shaving. And I am so sick of porcupine panties, I am not bald down there, weird stubblies that stick to my panties and rip the toilet paper when I wipe. But the Onc is still sounding very optomistic, PET scan after next AC to make sure existing tumor is shrinking then onto next phase which will be Taxol plus something to be determined later. Happy Minimal Side-effects Day to everyone and no allergic reactions to Taxol Warriors!",

I wish there was surgery to go pluck that sucker out, that is too close to chest wall for comfort.

So hopefully, this weeks scan will show that the lymph node is ....whatever happy lymph nodes are. If I wasn't scared of dying, this all would be kinda cool.

One crappy thing, I had a CT scan in May for a kidney stone, no one bothered to point out my cancer to me then. They were just looking for kidney stones.

First, toilet paper rips. What the heck is that about. I guess I would have toilet paper balls if I had hair for them to get stuck in. It is the same paper I have used for years. I don't have 5:00 shadow down there. Why does the paper tear up?? Second, why do my panties feel stuck to me? What the hell are they sticking to? Did they used to just glide back and forth over the hair? Third, the pee doesn't come out straight anymore. Did the pubic hair act as a wick to get the pee to shoot straight down? Fourth, as perhaps most disturbing, my farts don't shoot straight out in the back anymore. Sometimes they seem to roll forward and I HATE THAT. Did the pubic hair pop little fart bubbles and now they can't pop so they just roll around? Or has chemo decreased the force behind my gas? I haven't been \"bald\" down there since puberty. I was a beard trimmer kinda girl, kept a nicely manicured bush. I never realized how many functions that pubic hair served. Panty gliding, fart popping, pee directing .... I miss my pubes.",

Rumor has it that Kate Winslet had to wear one in \"The Reader\" movie since she had too little pubic hair (due to frequent waxing) to play a woman in that time period. Dita Von Teese may have a line of crystal merkins to go with her pasty collection. Your pubic hair trivia for the day. I have had to virus scan twice since doing this morning's research.",

And then those little pfft, pfft, old lady farts that roll around until they meet resistance. My pubes and those \"back there\" did indeed provide the necessary resistance to pop those little pfft, pffts and send them into the ozone. Maybe I could hang a mud flap of sorts, like you see on the tires of 18 wheelers. Edited to add additional research: Chemo does slow intestinal peristalsis which is why we get constipated. So is stands to reason that my fart velocity has decreased, more little pfft, pffts. Anal mud flaps, hmmm",

Little boogers said they are fine about being un-parented.   I feel better this morning. Researching my plastic surgeon options (Alicia has inspired me). Turns out there is only one PS within a 50 mile radius that takes my insurance. I talked to one of nurses about how many reconstructions he does a year, they had no idea since it is so many. But the receptionist said he did her tummy tuck last year and is doing her boob job next. So I guess that is a good recommendation if the people that see your work and see how you are with patients want to use you. I just find it odd that the state breast cancer insurance has one breast cancer surgeon on it's policy and I live next to the capitol of the state, I am not in a rural area.",

Now, I don't normally crochet, I know how to do the basics, I just don't do it but once every 5 years or so. But my mom crochets while I am doing chemo so I thought I would give it another try. Do not operate heavy machinery or crochet hooks during Benedryl infusion. Luckily, I am using yarn that has several different colors in it, so the stitches are kinda camouflaged. But the edges are all catty-whompered, it gets skinny, than fat, then skinny again. My mom is going to teach my how to make a ruffle around the edge to try to mask it. I will call it chemo charming, or chemo chic. ",

I did get very teary during yesterdays chemo. There was an elderly man that I saw during his first infusion last month.

Luckily, I have not been given much pink stuff and I have actually given some pink stuff that I had from before, to the thrift store.

Maybe I am just tired of people staring at my boobs trying to tell which one is rubber. (I wear a prosthesis since I have not had any recon yet).

PET scan on 6/2, next infusion 6/3 and onc will let me know what scan said. There was a question about rads, nurse made it sound like it wasn't a sure thing but I saw the onc and he said it is not 'if' but 'when'. I just assumed it would be in the next couple of weeks. My fear is that if the PET scan still shows activity, they will want to do more chemo, but that is a completely unfounded fear since I have never heard anyone say that. So I will stop making up things to worry about. I saw the cancer shrink today for the first time. So now I have a cancer shrink (therapist) and a cancer shrinker (onc).

I imagine that stage 4 is just fighting down each spot as it comes back. The last scan showed the newly dead lymph node and a \"questionable spot\" on my chest. The onc felt that the spot may be due to surgical changes. That made no sense to me since I have had 3 scans since surgery, why didn't surgical changes show up then? Maybe I will get a better read on what is going on today. They take Xrays every week so I am starting to convince myself that it can't be cancer, it would have shown up on last weeks Xrays. Linda, have you scanned again since the sternum spot? Did they ever label it?",

Visions of pork rind necrosis oozing out.....yuck.",

It has been a major, major issue, the whole family torn apart. Sister went ballistic during Thanksgiving yelling how my cancer inconvenienced my Mom since I needed rides to chemo and crap.

There is crap everywhere!! And there is no sign of Christmas in my house, no tree, no stockings, no cookies. The kids thought I was being a scrooge until they saw how much work this was going to be. But they have been helping and are starting to get excited. They confessed that they really didn't think I would be able to pull this off. But, one room is painted and the second one will get finished today. I have all my stuff moved out. Moving the bunkbeds will be the toughest part. The kids will meet the beau tomorrow. He has a truck and will help me get the boxspring I bought home. My 11yo DD is having fun, she painted her light switch plate to match her bedding and is adding all those cute little decorative touches, she watches a lot of home shows! My 13yo is excited to have a teenage room all to herself! She wanted the walls painted black, we compromised on dark purple. Hope everyone is great, have a wonderful holiday!!",

It is not a fancy infection, just basic staph and he is surprised it is being so stubborn. My breast area is still red and swollen and tight. We think maybe the radiation just slows down the healing of an infection. The breast is red but the flap is white, it is not infected since it is still getting its blood supply from the back. I went to a Tae Kwon Do class last night, it was 'Families Kicking Cancer\" at the Gilda's club. That was fun. the kids didn't hate it and I was able to do quite a bit without being sore today.

He is still red and tender. The antibiotics are not working on him but I am pretty sure he is some kind of abscess. I am able to wear my foob again, last week everything was so tender I was having to wear the cushie foob again to go to work. It is odd to me how important it is that I have some projection on the Mx side. I have left the house without a bra since Clyde came on the scene, but I have a special shirt, very big and baggy with very loud prints which I hope is visually distracting enough. But to go to work, or see people I know, I want something in there. It's not like they don't know I am boobless, I don't know why I will suffer to \"look normal\". Oh well, I am back to being able to foob so it's getting better. I am loving the hair pics, I need to take a new one, but frankly, I looked better bald!",

I don't know what the best way to do this is, if I assume everything is a new cancer, I will always be stressed. If I assume it will never happen again, I will be devastated if is does happen again. So, the best I can come up with it like playing \"whack-a-mole\". It may pop up again and I will whack it back down. I have met a woman who has been dealing with this shit for 19 years, 19 years of whack-a-mole! I am learning to embrace the days I don't see the little booger, the days I believe in sinus headaches, pus filled abscesses and arthritic hips. And I try to spend the other days, the days of brain tumors, recurrances and bone mets, shoring up my artillary for another round. It amazes me how everything changes when I make up my mind to believe something. One little factoid can change everything. I believed I was happily married...I found out he was screwing around. That factoid changed everything. I believed my lump was an out of control cyst, the biopsy results changed my reality. When I think about how fluid my reality is....kinda wild really. Reality should be \"real\", but reality is just what we know at the time. I think I have had to much coffee!! I love you Brenda, keep us posted.",

I have been thinking about the body image thing (Alicia, you look fabulous but I feel like it doesn't matter how many other people say it. But my hope is that you see it soon). Oddly, the thing I am most self conscious about is my ass. My hair is not my fault. My chest is not my fault. My stomach-ehh, I will let being a mom take credit for that. But my ass, I can't blame that on anyone but me. The other flaws are my clucked up trophy for having some of the battles I have had. But, there are no battle scars on my ass, I just earned this ass from years of Dorito's and crap. I have another gripe. I shaved my legs for ...30 years or so. I took 6 months off from shaving my legs during chemo. How could I have gotten out of a 30 year habit in 6 months. My legs are always so hairy. I guess I shaved a lot more often than I realized. I really got spoiled with those two minute showers when I didn't have to shampoo and shave. Oh, one more thing. Does anyone else feel like their hair doesn't get wet like it used to? It is still a little duck-ish, water repellant. I stick my head under the water and it just doesn't seem to be soaking in. I have to flip it around to get the water to the hair underneath. Michelle: is this the stress test you were going to have in October? So what is the next thing on your checklist?",

It seems odd that I am more concerned about the nodes than the breast, but one is cosmetic, one is very functional. Just my opinion, I do think I have become emotionally unattached to the \"healthy breast\". Option 1: I keep boob, do a lift and possible implant for symmetry. Still have to worry about BC in that side. In twenty years, I get BC again, they hack it off and take nodes and then I worry about lymphedema on both sides plus I am lopsided again. Option 2: do the mastectomy now, drastically reduce chance of BC in that breast thereby protecting lymph nodes from being affected. Get better symmetry and have a good arm. It seems like a no-brainer when I write it out. I am just not sure that my nodes vs boob arguement it an accurate one. I want some one to say that removing the breast will protect the nodes. I work in a nursing home and see a lot of lymphedema. Women trying to use walkers to walk but having trouble putting that much weight into their upper extremities due to lymphedema.",

I wore a different bra for the fitting and so my fancy wedding night undergarment made the wedding dress fit differently. The lady who did the alterations was not pleased. Good times and bad times we have had. The nipple crushing incident with the large cans of tomatoes- sorry about that. Being stepped on and rolled on by babies jumping on the bed - sorry about that, too. The whole breast feeding thing, sorry about the crappy parts of that, the thrush, the being raw, the breast pumping, it was all a necessary evil.

I felt like a failure after having C-sections and you helped me feel redeemed by becoming a breast feeding champ. The nerf ball size engorgement, the crazy bras, the funky clothes, we made it through it all. I remember the last time I nursed my youngest daughter. Thanks again for all that. Remember that thing that the one guy did, pretty cool, that is a memory of you that I will always appreciate. Remember the time I had to redirect the guy since you slid downhill since our last encounter, funny memory, but not quite as pleasant. But it wasn't your fault, you fought gravity like a champ. Oh and sorry for trying to make you do jumping jacks. Double D's should not have to put up with that. But remember how funny the kids looked holding their chest. That is how they thought you were supposed to do jumping jacks. Now we get to the lump part. That morning in the shower, that panic, the brief denial, doctors, tests, drills, and finally the diagnoses-Cancer. You were once a novelty, then a sexual organ, then a baby feeding machine, then you struggled against gravity to maintain an air of vital womanhood. Now you are a tumor to be analyzed, handled by strangers, bruised, painful and about to hacked off in a cold operating room. Where I once suckled my children will be replaced by  an ugly scar. Men used to feel you and get excited about what was to come, now men in lab coats feel you and their face drops and they wish me luck on the cancer journey. I don't hold it against you, we had a good run. I could have tried to have them carefully carve out the cancer and save some of you. Please don't take it personally, you are not  my friend anymore, you have to go. I will not subject myself and my children to long treatments to try and shrink your poison so I can have some of you left. You are just too far gone, in my opinion. Thanks for the memories, the good the bad and the ugly. It is weird, I remember the \"growing pains\", I remember the great naked times, I remember the breastfeeding sensation, and I am aware of the sensation of cancer cells growing in those ducts that once carried milk to my young. I kept feeling like I was lactating, but it was cancer cells filling up my breast. That weird arm rub women do when they are engorged, I did that because my breast was filling up the cancer. You were a great tool, but now you are a liability. I am glad to have the memories I have but I need to make about 40 more years of memories. I mean no disrespect to you, but good riddance. In about 24 hours you will be gone. Take all the crappy cancer with you please. Don't leave anything behind. Right now, I do have good memories, so retract your claws and go peacefully. I hate thinking of them cutting you off and plunking you in a cold stainless steel bowl for dissection. But you were once cradled nicely, oh I guess I shouldn't blame you. You didn't do this to me. But better a boob than a brain or something important.

If I have a prophy mastectomy and then reconstruct, would that protect my lymph nodes on my good side from having a ALND if I recur? If I remove the breast, I significantly decrease chance of BC in \"good side\" and should protect those nodes from being hacked up, right??? (I do realize that some people get BC even after mastectomy, I am just playing the odds here.) So, if protecting nodes on unaffected side is more important to me than having a boob on that side, wouldn't prophy mastectomy be a good idea?? I asked Onc about it, their feeling was any additional cancer would be treated as recurrance and they probably wouldn't do an ALND anyway. But if I get it again after 20 years, I am not sure those rules would apply. Any input from the women with much more experience than I have?

You were a great tool, but now you are a liability. I am glad to have the memories I have but I need to make about 40 more years of memories. I mean no disrespect to you, but good riddance. In about 24 hours you will be gone. Take all the crappy cancer with you please. Don't leave anything behind. Right now, I do have good memories, so retract your claws and go peacefully. I hate thinking of them cutting you off and plunking you in a cold stainless steel bowl for dissection. But you were once cradled nicely, oh I guess I shouldn't blame you. You didn't do this to me. But better a boob than a brain or something important. So, bye boob, I'll wear that hot pink bra you liked for you last day. melinda-musing.blogspot.com/ Dx 9/22/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 2, 9/19 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
