I was wondering if any one is also on an A.I.  Is TDM1 compatible with Letrozole or any other AI?  I was taken off Letrozole at start of trial and I'm not sure if this due to trial criteria (ie the drug company wanting to be sure any changes are due to TDM1 alone) or if the two are incompatible.  Any thoughts?   Many thanks Della",
