I've had a port for a year and a 1/2 for infusions for a neurlogical disease(that they think now may be caused by the undetected tumor and may be cured by the chemo as well!!) stage IIA grade 2 vascular invasion. Surgery 9/6 bilat mastÂ (and 9/7 for a hemorrhage!) back to the gym on day 4 and to work as a PT on day 10.
