So just getting called back doesn't indicate a problem. Of course, if they see something new they may want to do another biopsy. Or perhaps an untrasound or MRI, which can show more than a mammo.

I had a lumpectomy originally with radiation to follow. The margins weren't wide enough, so my surgeon returned for better margins. Darned if that didn't turn up a whole new tumor that didn't show on the Mammo. So I elected to get a mastectomy. I took it easy a little longer with the MX, but didn't need pain meds after the first couple of days. The margins on my MX were good, so no radiation needed. I chose not to get reconstruction because I'm 71 and didn't want more surgery. I wear a lightweight silicone form and look completely normal in my clothing. If I were in my 30's or 40's, my decision might have been different on reconstruction. So remember to breathe. It's really scary in the beginning because your mind can conjure up images that are worse than reality. This is a good site for facts without sensation. ",

Do get the mammogram and don't freak out if they want additional tests. Lots of time they send you for an ultrasound because it can tell if it's a cyst filled with fluid. Lots of women are sent for a biopsy, because that's the best way to tell for sure what's going on. And the majority of women who have biopsies are found to not have cancer.

Sometimes you find another bad spot and in the end you decide it's not worth keeping. They haven't noticed or asked, but I felt better having an explanation prepared. Don't worry about thinking you \"caused\" it by doing anything. The biggest risk factor is being female. Women on here have led all kinds of lives.

A second, hidden, tumor was found when I went back. At that point, I decided on mastectomy. The mastectomy was a bit longer recovery, but not difficult.

I think it took 2-3 days to get the results because they had to be read by a radiologist. An MRI is the best screening for dense or lumpy breasts and it sounds like you have a good doc. Best wishes for B9 results. Please let us know your results when you get them.",

Once you take off you get above the clouds, and that's all you can see. Be sure to take a book or magazine to read and something to eat. I always take almonds and dried apricots and sometimes cookies. Any more, all you get on the plane is a snack and a pretty pitiful one at that. When you get to the gate, tell the gate person that you need pre-boarding. They let folks who might be slow or have kids in hand go first. If walking is difficult or slow, you can ask for meet and assist. They will have a wheelchair or a little vehicle that holds about 6 people and take you to the gate. I worked for Pan Am in Houston for several years and we flew everywhere. After I quit, we took a car trip to western Texas.

I am curious to meet my ARNP - hope I like her better than the Onc. My impression of the Onc was that he doesn't appreciate women looking up stuff.

They couldn't be sure if it was cancer or something else. I had already elected mastectomy, so it didn't influence my decision. The pathology looked carefully at that spot and it was all normal.

The MX was far easier than abdominal surgery (the only other kind I've had). I think I took pain medication for about 3 days. I'm sure it will be far easier than her back surgery was. I elected not to have recon and am happy with that decision. I think chemo depends partly on age as well as stage. If you are 37 and have a long life ahead, they are far more like to prescribe chemo than if you're older, just because you have so much longer for a reccurrence to happen.

I was diagnosed at 71 and take a lot of meds. So far the BC has only added one. I honestly think you'll do fine. Stay off Google for cancer info. There's no way of telling if it's accurate or outdated. This site has reliable information. You might try \"cancer center ratings\" and see if there's a website that has information on various ones. There may be people on here who have first hand knowledge of the one you're planning to go to. If you don't get answers, try a new post asking about cancer treatment in your state or part of the country. This weekend try to distract yourself with activities you enjoy. Exercise helps anxiety.

It's a good idea to take someone else with you to the appointments, so there's another set of ears. There's a lot of good information on this site about choices and options. Usually lumpectomy is followed by radiation. Mastectomy (removal of the whole breast) might not need radiation if there was nothing close to the chest. I was told that the outcomes are the same as far as recurrence is concerned. If you are considering reconstruction, you should talk to a plastic surgeon about options for that. There are several ways to reconstruct depending on circumstances. A plastic surgeon could recommend the ones you might use.  Although you're in shock right now, you have time to research and make choices. Everyone wants it out NOW, but most tumors grow pretty slowly. Your appointment on Wed will probably be spent talking about your choices and what the doctors recommend. There's a list of questions on this site that you can print and take with you to your appointment. They may have enough info from the biopsy to know the hormone markers and grade (how quickly it is growing). Those things might influence your choice. In the meantime, read some of the info here and stay OFF Dr. Google. You know the info here is accurate. Please come back and let us know how it goes. ((((((HUGS))))))",
