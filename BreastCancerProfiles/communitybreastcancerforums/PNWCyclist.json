I have started losing my hair, though I shaved it about a week ago. I have not seen any reduction in the size of my tumors. The primary tumor was 8 cm to begin with and the lymph node was about 3 cm and both still feel huge. I can see them through my skin and can easily grab them. Ugh. I guess I hoped to see some progress by now as brutal as the chemo has been.",

I literally had no idea cancer could cause such utter depression and an almost constant anxious feeling. I also HATE not having hair but oddly, I do not wear a hat almost ever. Anyone else just go bald?",

Met oncologist yesterday and getting port placed Monday 9/17 and start chemo Tuesday 9/18. He said we have no time to lose as my tumors are \u201caggressive and high grade\u201d which freaks me out. I do not know all of the abbreviations but the first chemo drug I am getting is Adriamycin or \u201cRed Devil\u201d so I have heard it called? Is anyone else on this? I am intersted in hearing about your experience.",

Back in November, they found a new spot on my right lung that had not been there in September. I also found out my tumor is attached to my chest wall and that some of those lymph nodes are involved. So it has been rough. I literally only wear a hat if I want to be warm but I finally gave up on wearing one to avoid the knowing glances. I feel like cancer is so much more than a disease, it is like a lifestyle right now. I am not sure if that even makes sense.",
