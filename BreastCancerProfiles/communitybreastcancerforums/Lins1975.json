I had the same thing while I was in hospital and even though I was seeing the physiotherapist every other day to learn how to do Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD), there were two incidents where the swelling was very bad and the surgeon had to carry out a needle aspiration. The procedure was very simple, she inserted a needle through the incision and took the fluid out. The area was already numb from surgery, so it wasn't painful. Only took a few minutes. I noticed that the swelling increased temporarily every time I exercised my arms. I would see the surgeon about the swelling. But also ask for instruction on how to perform manual lymphatic drainage and start doing that every day.Â I was also taught shoulder range excercises, but not sure if that applies in your case as I had a mastectomy. Good luck and speedy recovery L",
