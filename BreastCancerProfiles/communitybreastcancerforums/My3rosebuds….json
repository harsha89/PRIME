Has anyone started recently who has IDC, triple positive,and can share their experiences and advice? At what point does the hair fallout? Any pain in feet (neuropathy?) after minimal walking? Sensitivity to the sun? What are your side effects and what days are your good/bad days? What are you able to eat? Thank you for sharing your experiences.

Last Thursday I was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Cancer (IDC). I am 44 years old and have a 5-year old girl, who I want more than anything to raise her and see her grow up. Divorced last year and on my own on this. This news was devastating, especially since my maternal grandmother passed away from breast cancer at the age of 45. Oncologist reviewed and gave a preliminary diagnosis of stage 1. It is estimated at 5mm. After reading this site, I believe they know more once the surgery is done. So I don't know what to think of the stage 1 at this point. The oncologist wants to do the surgery within the month, and all tests were ordered STAT so it leads me to believe this is more urgent than a stage 1. Or is this typical for any cancer diagnosis? Genetic testing to be done this Wed. Has anyone done this? If so, how did it affect your decisions on treatment? Oncologist said if mutation then 40% chance cancer will come back so mastectomy will be recommended. If hereditary, then 5% chance? I hope I am sharing these statistics correctly. Anyone have this experience? They said it may take a month to get these results and the oncologist seemed to want to do the surgery sooner than later. MRI with contrast medium scheduled for a week and a half from now. Then follow up with oncologist to determine course of action. How was the MRI experience? Have never had an MRI. Once the MRI done, what had been your experience? Is the stage # then adjusted accordingly? Did any of you wait for genetic testing to determine if lumpectomy, mastectomy, double mastectomy? So new to this and overwhelmed. Should I schedule the lumpectomy as soon as possible to get the cancer out of there, then may have to have another surgery once genetic testing results come in? Thank you for any thoughts and insights shared. Blessings to all. - Karen Dx 5/26/16, IDC, 9mm, Stage IB, 0/8 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ 6/21/16 Left breast lumpectomy 8/8/16 Taxol, Herceptin Log in to post a reply",
