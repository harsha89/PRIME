Stay firm and do not give up.  \"Loose it\" if you have to. Teresa",

New to this board.  New to the advanced stage of this disease.  Original diagnosis was Sept 04.  Advanced stage was April 07.  Many ups and downs with this stage.  Many unknowns. Just wanted to let you know that I am pulling for you and Diane",
