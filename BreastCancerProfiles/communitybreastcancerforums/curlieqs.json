Everyone is different, and take it one day at a time. I believe that the mind is a powerful thing, and having a positive attitude can actually help with the prognosis as well as faith and a strong support system. Some may laugh at this, for I have been ridiculed by this response before. It is just my opinion. My cousin is a specialist in breast cancer, and she confirms that her patients who have a positive attitude outlive those who do not. I know it is hard to digest the news you just received, but digesting it is a process, so hang in there. I am reading this fantastic book called : Love, Medicine, and Miracles by Bernie S. Siegel M.D. It gives me great hope, and I hope you pick up a copy. May it give you hope as well. Without hope, what else is left? Hugs to you, and know that I will be thinking about you. I will keep you in my prayers. Oh, I would be more than happy to send you my copy of the book if you are interested. Just PM me. Good vibes with you for your chemo on Monday!",

I never tried Megace though but heard wonderful stories about it. The citrus made me sick so what I do is make ice cream shakes and I throw in a bottle of Ensure, powdered milk, and protein powder. It sits well in my belly. Drink a little at a time and throw it back in the freezer so it is all ready to go when you need it. I also take a Zofran like 1/2 hr before I eat anything. I hope this helps. Best of luck to you and hugs to you Stephanie",

Remember me??? It will take a few weeks to get back into the groove of things for sure. Chemo knocks the crap out of you while working!!!  I do 12 hr shift (still on chemo) and my trick is stick to a sleeping schedule. I work nocs and I find if I budge from my AT LEAST 9 HOURS of sleep, I am toast. Also, drink tons of water on shift. I know this seems impossible to us nurses who never even have time to pee, but I feel it is so crucial, and I swear, it helps me. I feel more energized when I do. No iso patients is good idea, you do not need any help with an altered immune system! I have that restriction too and almost \"feel bad\" for not taking the MRSA/Flu/ESBl etc, but I work with such great people they never think twice about it. Just call on your co workers to help you if necessay. You would do the same for them. Your bod has been through so much, it will just take time. I have been back since mid January, and it took until beginning of Feb to feel somewhat normal again. You will get your act together, it just takes time Good luck girl, and do not work too hard!!
