    "Content": "Enilorac wrote: My mom had a bilateral mastectomy at 45. My grandmother and great-grandmother both had mastectomies at relatively young ages. I'm 42 and after a routine mammogram showed suspicious focal clustered calcifications, a mag view and subsequent 11ga core needle biopsy produced the following diagnosis: \"Distended ducts that are lined by columnar epithelium with cytologic atypia  are present. These changes fall within the spectrum of flat epithelial  atypia. Associated microcalcifications are identified.\"  My GP told me that these have been commonly known as atypical ductal hyperplasia. The radiologist strongly recommends a wide excision. I'm scheduled to consult with a surgical oncologist in the coming weeks.  Both of my parents are medical professionals. Obviously having an in-depth understanding of my genetics and predisposition for cancer, they're advising me to think strongly about a full mastectomy, possibly bilaterally.  I would really love to hear your thoughts on how conservatively or radically I should be thinking based on my DNA.  Thank you so much for your input.
