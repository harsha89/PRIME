I think I know who will win, its definitely the one going through the treatments.

One good thing that the nurse told me about having HER2 is that they know how to target it with treatment, where other types sometimes they are just guessing. My ongoligist said that 10 years ago they would have sent me home without treatment after my double massectomy ( Which I just wanted them gone, bye bye..lol) nothing in the nodes. Now they are being VERY aggressive. There is a HER2 message board just type that in your search engine. Your going to fight now just as you did before and get through this. Take it from your HER2 sister. Please keep us updated.     ",

I am not sure if you can use melatonin ( which is a natural chemical to tell your body to sleep ) ask your doctor. I take ambien and the xanax as Ruth mentioned it is hard enough going through this treatment, we need our rest. ",

It is ok to loose it as it is a whirl wind of information all at once. Your worn out by all of the tests, dr. appts , looking into mastectomy / reconstruction  maybe chemo. Hoping each Dr. is leading you in the right direction. Its overwhelming at times.  You have a strong good outlook and will need that to get through what is ahead. Just remember you will get through this, and you don't need to be strong for others, you need to be strong for yourself.  I am coming to the end of what is ahead for you, it sounds like you have a wonderful supportive family that needs to find their inner strength to support you. ",
