She could not stress to me enough the importance of having a physical therapist trained in lymphedema management and recommends getting baseline measurements. My RO told me that radiation increases the chance of lymphedema by 30%. My BS has been downplaying this, but I am going to insist the next time we meet that I need a referral to a PT. If he won't give me one I will get one from my PCP. I hope your hair is growing back!",

I just felt I needed to give my students as much consistency as possible. Did you have your ovaries removed? I am asking because I was told I could not take arimidex unless I was post menopausal. So, I would like to be post menopausal when this is over. The MO at Sloan also told me to keep BMI as low as possible to prevent recurrence. Exercise is also important. Since my cancer is fed by estrogen, I am looking for some free range chicken farms around here since chicken is really the only meat I eat. What is bikram yoga?",

Jeannie, how is the tamoxifen doing for you?  Any side effects?  There was a study that arimidex (or any arimitose I inhibitor) is better for lobular, but my onc won't put memo none until I have been through menopause.  One full year without a period and he will,switch me.  ",

I was also,perfectly healthy, so BC was a huge surprise.  Even though friends and family are supportive, it really helps to talk with women who are going through what we are. That is why these forums are so helpful.  So welcome. 2timer, I don't know the answer to your question.  Is it possible you just had a node in your breast so it is the same as having it in any node?",
