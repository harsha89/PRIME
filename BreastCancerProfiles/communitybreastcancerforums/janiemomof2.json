I do breast self exam but didn't pick up on anything... my mammogram found \"something\" that led to u/s that led to core biopsy (all inside of 2 days) which led to a phonecall on a Friday afternoon (1/20/12) that I have IDC (invasive ductal carcinoma). My head is spinning. The complete path report with receptors was finished today: ER+/PR+ Her2- After reaching out and looking for recommendations I have decided to go with the Rena Rowan Breast Center at Penn for my breast surgeon and oncologist. I feel fortunate to live in Philly where there are so many options for treatment. My appt is tomorrow and it can't come soon enough; I have so many questions. I'm so scared. I could just cry and cry and cry. I'm holding it in most of the day b/c we haven't talked to the kids yet (14 & 9), we were waiting to get a better sense from the BS about a clear path ahead so we could answer the kids' questions. This whole ordeal started with mammy & u/s on Monday the 16th and I've lost 6lbs since then b/c I'm so sick to my stomach all the time. The radiologist said the tumor is very far back against my chest wall and that it was hard to get to for the biopsy so my head is spinning about what that mean. I have been short of breath with such a tight feeling in my chest ever since the biopsy (18th). I try so hard to think positive but I'm terrified. I'm terrified that it is everywhere and they won't be able to help me. In the midst of all of these big emotions I'm trying to be a good advocate for myself and read all I can and make a list of questions to ask but right now my mind is blank. It's like I just want to curl up in the dark somewhere. bad day. janiemomof2 Dx 1/20/2012, IDC, 2cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/5 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I'm 3 weeks PFC and generally feeling ok, \"normal\", except for the fatigue - wow. I'm ready for my regular energy to return. Now, all of a sudden, yesterday I got pitting edema in my ankles. Not up my legs but all around the foot/ankle area. Never during tx but just now. Is it really from the Cytoxan? It's weird that it wouldn't have done it during tx! Not sure if I should call about it or wait to see if it gets better/worse. It just got really hot on the east coast so I'm sure they will dismiss it as the heat but truthfully, I NEVER get swollen from heat. And, I have white fuzzy growth on my head. Not much but it's definitely something. I even still have some small patches of stubble that never fell out after shaving my head. Nothing under my arms, my eyebrows and lashes are thinned but hanging in there. I'm kinda over being bald. It's too hot for the wig, I'm sick of my scarves. Mostly wearing a baseball hat but really ready to have hair again :( Hope everyone is doing well with minimal se!",

I'm sure part of it was just exhaustion but also I was constipated so I took miralax---- woah! I can't believe how bad my cramps and pain were... it finally worked about 5 hours later but that was a tough few hours. I feel kinda achey and flu-like which they said would happen so although not unexpected it is still unpleasant :( Slak -- I did take the Ativan (1mg) last night and it helped! I only slept til 5am but I will take that over the usual 3am! I also took my Dex a bit earlier yesterday than I had been taking it, luckily today is my last dose of that until next round. As far as my Kale drink! Similar to Kim I use a strong blender (one of the older versions of the Vitamix - I would love an upgrade but the old school one works fine :) I put *alot* of Kale, whatever fresh fruit I have; usually strawberries, blueberries, mango.... also I like alot of fresh ginger it gives it such a nice bite. I add a couple heaping tablespoons of frozen apple juice concentrate and about 6 ounces of water. Yum-O! My DH and I start everyday with some version of that, it's pretty forgiving, you can put anything in there. Now, I have questions! This metallic taste has got to go!!! What are your best suggestions??? Also, what are your thoughts about this Neulasta pain? Mine has already begun which was surprising b/c I though it happens later! I've been using a hot water bottle and a hot rice sock but it's so deep that it only barely touches it. Ok, I hope everyone is having a good day",

I must agree that it has been a strange and isolating experience for me.

On the upside................ I graduated nursing school on Friday! I will be taking a prep class for boards between tx #3 and tx#4 and then taking the exam at the end of June.

All I can say is that I was managing ok through surgery/recovery and even through the first two rounds of tx. This last tx #3 kicked my butt and I could barely get out of bed for over a week. Luckily my DH could pick up the slack with the kids and I missed some crucial study days, but at the end of the day I'm not going to get \"fired\" for either of those balls dropped. I would work as long as you can but be open to the idea that your body may have other plans for you. Perhaps look into short term disability now so that if you need it at some point you have already done the leg-work for it. Kim - I hate those steriods!!!! They ALWAYS wake me at 3:30am too!

I didn't realize they would be as intense as they were, or last as long. here is my experience (everyone is different): Chemo #1 - March 29th... horrible constipation and upper abdominal pain through Monday (day 5) beginning on Tuesday (day 6) I was literally peeing out of my butt if I had a morsel of food, it didn't matter what it was. The diarrhea was accompanied with long periods of time on the toilet with horrible lower bowel cramping. I *thought* by day 8 that I was turning a corner so I went to a conference for school - big mistake - all I had was a banana and water and by 10:30am I was in the toilet at the conference center for an hour. I had to leave when I had a window of time to drive home. This was a very low moment and bad emotional day for me. I actually felt \"attacked\" by the treatment and like I had to live like a recluse. That level of diarrhea continued until I had a semi-normal but still soft stool yesterday morning (day 13). I have been fairly \"normal\" GI -wise yesterday to today which was just in time for the huge hair fallout that began on the evening of day 12. Today is day 14 and I'm feeling ok. I have a lingering headache for a day or two but otherwise I feel as close to normal since before the treatment. Of course I go back next week for tx #2 so the cycle will start all over again but I'm enjoying this sense of normalcy while I can. So, all in all I had about 5 days of constipation followed by about 6 days of diarrhea. Hopefully you are about in the clear - fingers crossed! I don't normally drink it but the red gatorade has been my best friend for the last week - it's been like virtual IV fluids. Good luck!!!",

Though, I'm still battling with the diarrhea, it's at least more manageable than it's been. I'm also so tired. I went to bed at 4pm yesterday after Easter festivities. I woke at 9pm, just for an hour and went back to sleep til 6am. And I NEVER nap! I guess this is a new world order. I am grateful this morning that I feel like I'll be able to accomplish something today, I have felt totally useless around the house and with the kids. Here is one issue I need to deal with though. I have a low level headache for a few days now. The MO doesn't want me to take Ibuprophen or Tylenol at all during tx. Her reasoning is that it can \"cover up a fever\". I'm not much of a pill taker to begin with so the idea of taking an Oxy for a headache seems ridiculous to me. And, I will be completely useless if I take that - I can't function. Any suggestions? I know it's not from dehydration b/c I am drinking about 3 liters of water a day in addition to gatorade and non-caff tea. Plus my morning Kale drink. Happy Monday!",

This latest tx #3 on May 10th has absolutely owned me and my body. It has been horrible. For some reason I skipped right over those usual first few days of constipation and just went right into the worst diarrhea I have ever had in my life. I was so depleted and sleep deprived by Monday morning that my onc wanted me in the hospital. I got alot of fluids and they wanted a stool sample which for the first time in days I couldn't produce!! Probably b/c I had stopped eating in an effort to avoid going to the toilet. I was going multiple times an hour. So they sent me home with a container to get a sample at home. I was hoping it had all passed and I was done with it but no.... it all started up again last night and I went to the bathroom at least 10 times between 9pm and 5am this morning. I think the fluids helped me, I don't feel as \"out of it\" but I'm still really dizzy and kinda nauseous, probably from such little food. I feel like a rung out papertowel. Barely out of bed for the last 72 hours, missed Mother's Day :( and just all in all feeling crappy inside and out. This has definitely been the worst round for me, without question. I need to turn a corner, and soon.",

I hope I'm turning the corner, still having diarrhea but at least not as frequently. Fri/Sat/Sun I was going multiple times an hour around the clock. The no-sleep thing was definitely contributing to my very bad state of mind, despite trying Lunesta each of those nights (it didn't work). By Monday morning I was laying with the phone in my hand waiting to call the office at 8:30am as soon as they opened. They finally called me back around 10 and told me to come in for fluids and that I sounded dreadful. I got in there and they ran labs - all my numbers were good. They wanted a stool sample which would have to wait b/c I couldn't make it happen (ridiculous!). The fluids were a tremendous help and they sent me home saying that I was surely \"turning the corner\" but if it continued it might be an intestinal parasite and I would have to come back to be admitted for IV abx and more fluids. By Monday at 5pm I started having diarrhea, again, but at least it wasn't as bad as it had been. It only woke me 2x over night and I felt much more rested and able to think clearly. So much so that at the 4am episode I managed to gather a stool sample for them that my DH brought in at 8:30am, Tuesday morning. Luckily, it was negative for the biggies (C.Dif, etc). They said just keep drinking, eat bananas, rest, small meals, no dairy, no green leafy, basically the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) in small quantities. So that is what I continued to do all day yesterday and I did continue to have diarrhea but it was a bit more manageable b/c it was at least spaced out by a couple of hours, what a concept!? Feeling very fatigued and weak I decided last night that I was going to get a full night of sleep no matter what so I went with my old standby - Tylenol PM. The benedryl just does it for me and I am so glad I did it.... Slept from 9 or 10 last night until 5am this morning, I woke up feeling like a new woman and I think DH was relieved that it was the first day in many days that I wasn't snarling at him before the sun came up :) As of today I have continued to have quite a few episodes of diarrhea that are accompanied by cramps that rival labor pains. There was one point on the toilet that I thought to myself, wow - this is exactly what it felt like pushing out my daughter. Weird, I know. No fevers, no bad lab work, maintaining hydration as best I can, still on the 2nd floor most of the day - just in case. I'm getting stircrazy though, today is day #7 post tx #3 and I really want to feel normal again. My poor DH is running himself ragged and I can tell my kids are ready to feel the relief of me feeling better again. They have gotten used to me \"bouncing back\" and it is just not happening this time, at all. Here's hoping tomorrow is the beginning of that time...  lsharvey822 - you were asking what I've done so far... this may require a little background. Because I had such bad constipation with round #1 for so many days that finally got resolved with Miralax and colace (per the MO) but then through me into horrible diarrhea for about 3 days, I had tried with rounds 2 & 3 to head off such extremes. With round #2 I was able to take Miralax as a preventative the night before chemo and also the day of chemo. I think it definitely worked to avoid the horrible constipation of the first round. The MO had me hold the colace and just do miralax the following night and by day 3 I was having bm's and all was happy in the world. Once I was having a daily bm she told me to stop miralax so I did and I didn't really have any other GI issues. However, the 2nd round for me was really bad with feelings of fatigue, shortness of breath and weakness. On days 7 & 8 I did have diarrhea that kept me close to home but it was nothing compared to this last episode! So, here comes tx #4 and I think - Great! We'll do the miralax again the night before and after chemo and all will be well. WHY DIDN\"T THAT WORK?! That's all I want to know. I did the exact same thing for this round #3 as I did for round #2 but had a disastrous outcome. The MO said that for #4 I may want to skip Miralax and just try colace before and after since it is more gentle (it isn't an actual laxative but a softener). This brings me to my question (sorry for such a ridiculously long post!): Those of you that have had success balancing side effects, especially the GI ones, what are you doing that works and what have you done that hasn't worked? I am very interested to hear from GeorgiaMom - did you do anything in particular in preparation for #4 that you think contributed to it going so smoothly? Lastly, re: immodium - my MO says with any diarrhea they always want to make sure it isn't a bacteria like C.Dif causing the diarrhea before they tell patients to use immodium which will just keep it in the body. That's why I had to do the stool sample. Now that it has been cleared as negative for all parasites I am technically \"allowed\" to use immodium but I'm inclined to jsut let it all come out if its coming. If I really needed to leave the house I would use it. Thanks for the support everyone, no one else in my life would either be interested or understand all this talk about poop!! LOL!",

I'm going way easy on the food and just drinking alot of water. I'm sooooo tired. That is truly the most cumulative, to piggyback on what others are saying. I walked down to the beach near the end of the day to meet up with DH and kids. I didn't even have to carry anything and I was so short of breath. My hgb is down a bit so I'm sure that's part of it but wowzers.... looking forward to feeling like the superwoman I usually feel like in life. I have a few weeks off until rads begin at the end of the month, hoping to get more \"good days\" out of this last round of chemo since round 3 rocked my world until just a few days before round 4. Hoping for minimal s/e for everyone and congrats for everyone who is done with this mess! xoxo",

I would say, for me, the worst days were day 3-8 (counting infusion day as day #1). So, that first week of work after your infusions will be tough but once you hit the weekend you will see a return of some energy and something resembling \"normal\" or \"good days\". Hang in there and drinks LOTS of fluids... I was trying for like 5000mls a day in the first few days just to flush, flush, flush! Good luck, hang in there!",
