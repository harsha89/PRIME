      "Content": "Ogicam wrote: After being diagnosed with stage two breast cancer, I had a lumpectomy and during surgery, the doctor also noticed the cancer had spread to my lymph nodes. He immediately urged a rush to chemo followed by radiation. This is of course standard protocol in the USA as the us medical system is under complete control of the major drug companies. Of course, hey also control the FDA and the insurance industry. It's one big happy family. After feeling like I was being shoved into such radical procedures without any options, I decided to take a deep breath and do lots of research. I figured I had lots of time since breast cancer is very slow developing in most cases. Well, a few weeks after surgery, I decided to give my immune system the first crack at this. Chemo would not give me that opportunity, and with a destroyed immune system, my chance of beating this or minimizing a recurrence would be dramatically reduced. First, and most important, I wanted to understand what was causing the cancer. What did I do to activate the dormant potential cancer cells we all have. Stress, diet, environment all played a role. Then I sought to find out what kills cancer cells outside of poisoning them. The answer was heat and oxygen. I also learned that sugar in all forms feeds cancer growth. Including fruit and most artificial sweeteners. To make a long story short, I discovered a clinic in Europe that provided Oxygen therapy (Ozone) as well as heat to replace radiation known as localized Hyperhermia. Both of which destroy cancer cells on contact. I learned there were many more options that would not harm the body, yet effectively kill the cancer. Many have been in use for nearly 100 years with great success. But let me also warn, I am not saying these treatments cure cancer. Only the human body can control cancer production and therefore, finding the cause is far more important. Then, by feeding the body what it needs to keep cancer in limbo is the obvious course to follow. It's a process and since every cancer is different, each person must find what works for them. The one-size-fits-all approach of cut-poison-nuke used in the United States should be the last option considered after giving your body an opportunity to neutralize the cancer cells naturally. Why would anyone choose the draconian methods when hundreds of thousands of people have survived worldwide by simply using alternative techniques to kill the cancer, and then lifestyle changes and diet changes to keep the cancer in a dormant state. This is what I have done and its been successful. It does not mean I have the only solution. I'm simply stating do not make a rush decision until you have done all the research. Be skeptical of the statistics as I have found numerous fudging of the numbers, and mixing of the data. Also understand who has oversight of those statistic gathering models. I'll leave it at that. The point is, we are not living in mid-evil times. When you cut your finger, you don't dip it in poison, stick it in the microwave, and then cut it off later as a first course of treatment. Well, why would you put your body through that without first researching alternatives that can create the same results without harming you?
