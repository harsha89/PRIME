A recent study found that early treatment by manual lymph drainage may even be able to prevent lymphedema. The experiment group was given manual lymph drainage from 2 days after breast surgery for six months, and had no swelling, while the control group had 10% excess lymph fluid at that same time. [Ref.

My dear wife Pearl is a breast cancer survivor of 22 years. She had 21/24 positive nodes and went through modified radical mastectomy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy--\"the works\". Five years of medical neglect and three misdiagnosed cellulitis events later we found the treatment, i.e. complex decongestive therapy (CDT), and have been practicing it since. I bandage Pearl almost every night after she performs her simple lymph decongestion (self-MLD). She exercises in her compression sleeve and gauntlet every day. Her new oncologist (Head of the Oncology Department, no less), when he first saw her arm 15 years ago commented \"But you have such a mild case\" she responded \"Dr. xxxx, That's like being a little pregnant.\" When Pearl related this story to her lymphedema therapist, she responded \"Did you tell him that it looks this good because you control it every day with CDT?\" He had no clue! But today, it is hard to tell she has lymphedema. It has somewhat localized pre-fibrotic areas that require extra work, and spills out into her trunk a bit, but it is under control. And what is most important, Pearl has the tools to self-treat when she detects that her arm is \"filling up\". You can meet Pearl on our web site at http://www.lymphactivist.org",

Re Primary Care Physicians (PCPs): In addition to your trained therapist you need a primary care physician who treats your other medical problems and has a basic understanding of the pathophysiology of lymphedema. Lymphedema is being found to be intimately related to different body functions and systems, and your physician must make sure that your lymphedema treatment is coordinated with treatment for any other co-conditions you may have. Lymphedema is related to your heart and circulatory system, your immune system, your nervous system and your endocrine system and is not, as previously depicted, just a \"plumbing problem\" involving clogged or missing lymphatics. Since American-trained physicians are not trained in lymphology, you must find a physician who has picked up knowledge of the lymphatic system and its problems either through extra training courses or through experience with prior patients. Often it is the patient who must bring medical articles on lymphedema to their physicians. Re Importance of Early Care: You must be insistent on receiving early care of your lymphedema. In some recent small studies it has been indicated that lymphedema might be preventable with early intervention. The following is an abstract from my correspondence published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons July 2013: \"Current medical and economic studies support early detection and prevention of disease as a cost-effective means of avoiding progression to harder-to- treat stages. The \u201cprospective surveillance model\u201d is a proposed lymphedema care delivery system that would define early-stage breast cancer-related lymphedema when swelling reached 3% during the first year after breast cancer treatment. Lymphedema detected with this criterion would be treated with an inexpensive 20- to 30-mmHg compression sleeve for 1-month periods [Stout Gergich NL, Pfalzer LA, McGarvey C, et al. Preoperative assessment enables the early diagnosis and successful treatment of lymphedema. Cancer. 2008;112:2809-2819] Maintaining the lymphedema at a sub-clinical stage during the first year will prevent or retard the destructive tissue changes in a swollen lymphedema limb that define the progression of lymphedema. Another lymphedema care delivery model based on lymphedema early detection and intervention would provide manual lymph drainage (MLD) to the limb of a breast cancer patient from the second day after treatment and throughout the first year. The 6-month study included trial groups undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), with and without radiotherapy. The investigators measured percent excess arm fluid and provided intervention to all members of the intervention group. Although average excess fluid due to lymphedema in the women in the control group, who received no MLD, grew monotonically from zero to +10% at 6 months, the average excess fluid dropped monotonically in the MLD group from +1% to -1.5% [Zimmermann A, Wozniewski M, Szklarska A, et al. Efficacy of manual lymphatic drainage in preventing secondary lymphedema after breast cancer surgery. Lymphology. 2012;45: 103-112] The onset of lymphedema after surgical breast cancer treatment may not occur until 7 months (range 1 to 37 months). After a combination of surgery and radiotherapy, the onset of lymphedema may be a longer 12 months (range 1 to 52 months), and for radiotherapy only, 25 months (range 6 to 156 months) [Pierquin B, Mazeron J-J, Glaubiger D. Conservative treatment of breast cancer in Europe: Report of the Groupe Européen de Curiethérapie. Radiother Oncol. 1986;6:187-198]\"",

We favor non-elastic containment over elastic for flying. In plain language that means that short-stretch bandaging or non- or low- elastic garments (e.g. Solaris Tribute, JoviPac, MedAssist, etc) are more effective than circular-knit elastic sleeves. Flat-knit custom sleeves are in between. This is for the same reason that you do not usually sleep in an elastic sleeve (too high a resting pressure, too low a working pressure) when your arm/leg is inactive for many hours. If you MUST wear an elastic sleeve when flying, then take along a stress ball, a sponge rubber ball that you squeeze periodically, to use your arm muscle pump to keep the lymph flowing.",

Any disruption of the lymphatic drainage of the breast and upper torso, (e.g. by surgery, radiation or infection) can result in a build-up of fluids (lymph stasis causing lymphedema) in those regions. If not drained, the swelling can spread. Draining of this interstitial fluid, i.e. fluid in the tissue between the cells, is usually performed by a specially trained therapist, trained in the specialty called \"manual lymph drainage\" or MLD. Having first ruled out cancer, heart problems, infection and other medical causes, you should be seen by a trained and certified lymphedema therapist for evaluation and possible treatment. You do not want to allow the swelling to go, since there are tissue changes that take place that will cause it to get worse and result in permanent tissue changes that are much more difficult to treat. The therapist can also teach you self-MLD techniques which can slow down fluid accumulation, as can wearing of truncal compression garments as prescribed by your lymphedema therapist.

These are typically diagnosed by either ultrasound or MRI measurements of skin thickness. Normal skin thickness is about 1.5-2.0 millimeters. Much more than that is usually an indication of excess interstitial fluid = lymphedema. See Johansson 2014 on my web site at www.lymphactivist.org/review-j... This technique is used in Europe. I believe that Dr. Emily Iker in Los Angeles uses it. Another method of lymphedema diagnosis is measurement of the fluid content of the skin at 2.5 mm depth. This can be done with a device called the MoistureMeter-D made by a Finnish company Delfin. I agree with your initial assessment that the truncal/breast lymphedema could have been related to your axillary breast tissue surgery. That region is rich with lymph nodes and lymph vessels which drain lymphatic fluid from the breast, back, and arm, and removal of as few as one node with the tissue, if it is in the drainage path of the breast or arm, would explain lymphedema. See Baker 2014 on my web site at www.lymphactivist.org/review-b... Scar tissue could also block the drainage path, and this might be treatable with low level laser treatments or skillful physical therapy.",

This temporary \"post-surgical edema\" usually disappears as the lymphatics return to normal function. However, radiation retards reestablishment of the lymphatic network and it causes fibrosis of the irradiated nodes and filamentary structures that support and energize lymph vessels. The result is that whereas lumpectomy with sentinel lymph node dissection might result in a 6% risk of lymphedema, and lumpectomy with axillary clearance 24% risk, adding radiation might raise these risks to 15% and 40% respectively. There is a trade between reducing risk of local recurrence by radiating the breast VS accepting a chance of mostly salvageable recurrence VS increasing risk of lifelong lymphedema.

Pearl does her daily self-massage in the evening just before I wrap her for the night but she could perhaps schedule it at a different time if there were a time of daily maximum swelling. Bob ",

Based on my spouse Pearl's experience (she's another poster girl)  she has been leaving her sleeve off some days and there have been no bad effects. The general advice I have been given (from JoAnn Rovig)  is that once you have the swelling under control, try backing off the compression until you detect a loss of control--then resume the compression. You want to find the MINIMUM daily treatment which will still work.",

And Zimmermann, et al Lymphology 45 (2012) 103-112 demonstrated that manual lymph drainage started as early as 2 days after surgery and continued for six months prevented any swelling.",

Roughly 75% is diagnosed after 3 years with cases recorded at perhaps another percent each subsequent year. But what is really important is that lymphedema is usually progressive--that is, once the changes start occurring in the skin tissue, even if there is no gross swelling, the condition will worsen with time. Lymphedema is an inflammatory condition which brings progressive structural changes to the skin. So it is important to start treating it early--before it moves to clinical stages when it is harder to reverse. See www.lymphactivist.org/review-z... and also Weiss R. Prevention of Lymphedema.

      "Content": "Nov 28, 2008 06:44PM LymphActivist wrote: I've been reading the posts concerning lymphedema treatment problems at Kaiser Southern California, and can offer some help. My wife is a 16-year breast cancer survivor and we've been fighting with Kaiser in Redwood City (Northern California) and Woodland Hills (Southern California) for about 12 years now for proper care of her lymphedema. I offer the following comments: Concerning lymphedema therapy: Very few Kaiser therapists have had adequate training or certification in lymphedema treatment. The training of their staff is in the hands of their Physical Therapy Department Administrators who are in general not willing to send their staff for proper training, so most of the \"lymphedema therapists\" have had no more than a 22.5 hour North American Rehabilitation weekend course which is far less than the national certification requirements of 135 hours. They cannot handle anything more than a simple case of upper limb lymphedema, and their ability to do proper bandaging is spotty. We travel 40 miles from our home to qualified lymphedema therapists in Baldwin Park since the therapists in Woodland Hills are not qualified. Sunset used to have two qualified lymphedema therapists but both have moved on to Administration, and to my knowledge there are none there at present. Act quickly, since there is a Steve Norton 10-day course coming to Southern California in January, and if you can get your PT Department Administrator going this is an excellent opportunity to get their therapists a 135-hour course only missing one week of work. The course is two weekends and one work week. Chris Keller at Woodland Hills Kaiser has the brochure. Ask your Administrator to call Chris. If you have been diagnosed with lymphedema you have the right to demand a qualified therapist to treat you. If there is not one on staff at your facility then request that your PCP refer you to a qualified and certificated therapist out of network. This has been done when the patient is adament about receiving qualified medical care. If they refuse, file a complaint with Patient Services. If you do not get proper care then file a complaint with the state Department of Managed Health Care. On Bandages and Garments: Kaiser Southern California has been providing compression bandages and garments as part of lymphedema treatment since July 1, 2000. The allowable products and quantities are documented in a \"Durable Medical Equipment Formulary\" which they will not let you see (or even recognize its existence) even though it determines your coverage. The exact coverage depends upon your contract with Kaiser (Group, individual, Medicare-C, etc.) We get two sets of bandages and two compression garments (2 sleeves and 2 gauntlets) as medically required and prescribed by our PCP as often as every six months.   I'd be happy to help you through the Kaiser complaint system to receive qualified therapy and garments. If you give up and accept less-than-quality medical treatment then Kaiser Administration has no way of knowing there is a problem.And if they don't recognize a problem it will certainly not get fixed. By the way, can anyone who has seen the self instruction video tell me who produced it, the title, who gives the instruction, etc? Does it include MLD, bandaging, exercise? Upper and lower limb?
