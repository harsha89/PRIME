Trish - will say extra prayers that your onco is wrong and that you get an NED! I had my 3rd on Monday....been off steroids since 6-10 and have had a few minor headaches.  But end of last week and thru today, my headaches are more frequent and much more painful and I have had so much nausea that I'm eating Prochlorperazine every 6 hours and still not feeling well.  Anybody have any advice.  Thought it might be gall bladder but now the headaches, am wondering if just se's.  Okimi - are you still getting similar se's?

Gritgirl - I have been suffering with the muscle spasms too, sometimes they make me wanna scream.  MO said magnesium sulfate...I have been taking magnesium citrate 2x a day.  Will start with the sulfate based tomorrow.  I drink tons of water, and when the spasms are really really bad I drink 2 bottles of G2 Gatorade which has electrolytes in it and it does help a lot.  G2 is only one that has the electrolytes...might give it a try too.  Trish - Last summer my lower back started giving me fits.  I was walking 3 miles a day (wearing orthotics and well made shoes) and pool exercises in the summer and some biking.  Couldn't understand it so MO ordered MRI...showed tons discs desiccation, bulging, prortusion, nerve damage, overall degenerative disc disease etc etc.  I'm only 59 and knew after 3 years of anti-hormonals that my bone health would deteriorate...gotta have the hormones to avoid the osteo-stuff.  Anyway, I quit walking, and biking and lifting my grandkids or anything else over 10#.  Now use an elliptical and have had very little lower back pain over the last 8 months.  Hope this helps. Denny - mine too has spread to my nodes.  Have not and will not have surgery, so if Kadcyla doesn't work for me...well...I'll cross that bridge when and if I need too.  Don't know yet when my MO plans to scan...but she is planning on a MUGA in August, so maybe a PET then too.  I know I'll get my brain MRI in about 6 weeks. Will keep you all posted and will read with interest how you all are doing.  Sending prayers & positive healing energy to you all! Sue",
