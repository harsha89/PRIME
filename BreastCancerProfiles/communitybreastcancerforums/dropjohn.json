    "Content": "Jan 29, 2012 04:15PM - edited Jan 29, 2012 04:18PM by dropjohn Losing my hair - mine started falling out right after my second round of chemo, and I promptly shaved it. I had cut it shorter before that, and dyed it bright blue - there was no way I was going to deal with the mangy look. Not to mention the irritation of little bits of hair falling out all the time... and taking control of the process. I went bald or used 'buffs' a lot - henna tattoos as well. It wasn't that awful, though losing your nose hair will mean your snot slides right out, no control what-so-ever, and that sucks. You'll lose all your body hair as well, and if you're not used to the bald look, that's a a bit startling. Really, it's not that bad - though it can be chilly - a lot of it is attitude, IMHO. By far the easiest part of chemotherapy for me. It does take longer to come back than you'd think...and mine's coming in white and black (before I had some white hair in among the brown, but black?!? That's just strange....) and very very soft at first. If that was the worst of it, I'd be well pleased. *sigh* Chemopause sucks.Â ",
