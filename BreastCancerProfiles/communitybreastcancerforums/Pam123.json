( Funny no one every mention the tumor there last year)   I was a little shocked but then I told him about my neck.  He said that he wouldn't be surprised if it was cancer.   So when I saw him yesterday, he recommended the chemo.  And then dropped the you'll probably have to be on chemo for the rest of your life.   I was a little shocked by that.   I have been trying to figure out if it would be worth the chemo or not.  The dr even said that I will need to get a port, because my veins just won't last. ( the surprises kept coming!)   But let me just say again thank you for sharing your story.   Since my lump showed up, I had been trying to find information about the supraclavicular lyphnode.   Thank you.   I wish you all the best! ",
