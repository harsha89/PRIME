Developed painful swelling around left breast (beginnings of reconstruction with tissue expanders in place already), and now have cording in left armpit so bad that I can barely raise my arm at all. Very painful and tight. Also tightness trying to straighten my arm around the inside of my elbow. I'm scared of this side effect!!!! Anyone have any words of guidance??
