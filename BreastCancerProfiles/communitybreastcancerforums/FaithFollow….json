ONE MORE TO GO -- woohoo!!  I'm lubed up, peely, itchy and saggy but thrilled to almost be over this hurdle.  My magic lube potion was - aloe vera gel (GNC sells purse sized tubes), hydrocortisone cream, topped w/zinc oxide - the tech recommended this combo when  Aquaphor and Xclair didn't help when I had the severe burn last week (RO said it happens only 15% of the time)  I'm rather large breasted (34H) and can't wear a bra - fun times at work!  I wear cotton v-neck cami's w/spaghetti straps, one boob in/one out so they don't fight or rub, topped w/a cotton long sleeved shirt - the tightness around the arm & pit keep my skin from rubbing.  I wear everything inside-out so the seams don't rub my skin.  Old Navy has the tank's/cami's and I got the long sleeve shirts @ Target.  To disguise the sagging nipples, I got a poncho/wrap thing @ Kohl's, pin it shut and walk very intentionally or hold something at chest level! I'll stick around to see if I can offer any support to y'all. Hang in there - you can do it!",

Ladies, thank you for the reassurances re joint/muscle pain. I feel like I'm 90+.  I asked my onc for a bone density to help make decision re anti-hormone treatment.  I asked my radiation doc for echo cuz my ct scan for rads showed an enlarged heart.  Results from both tests will help determine best Rx for man pills (I like that one but I'm already the husband in my house! bahahaha) Sorry, I digress.  HMO approved echo but asked for more info supporting bone density scan.  We'll see what the final determination is but I'll get it done anyway cuz I have 2 ins. co's and the other will pay - I'm VERY lucky, I know!.",
