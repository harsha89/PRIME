I noticed in your Aug, 2012 post, the description of your experience from iort, was that \"a huge portion of my breast will permanently feel like a crow bar in my breast\". Has that changed since your post 16 months ago? In the last two weeks I have an area at the radiation site that started out as very firm tissue about the size of a quarter. It has more than doubled in size in two weeks, has gotten much harder in texture and continues to increase in size and density. Since yours was the first I have been able to find as a similar experience to mine, I am very interested if you still think the side effect is permanent. I would also like to know if many others have had similar experiences. Polly",
