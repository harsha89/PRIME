    "Content": "gnd wrote: Hi, I have recently gone to the doctors for suspicious breast changes and a lump under my left armpit. they sent me to get an ultra sound and a mammogram, but both results came back negative. well, they said they found 6 nodules on both breasts, but both were benign. then my doctor sent me to a breast surgeon and my parents came with to talk to him. he said that i had no reason to get a biopsy because there was nothing for him to target at. he ordered another mammogram for me in a couple of months. i am worried that its not going to find anything, although I will be happy if its really nothing. Should I go see a different surgeon after my second mammogram? I'm only 31 years old, single, no children, and i have some cancer in my family, but not breast cancer. ps: I do not know if this has anything to do with ibc but I have also been experiencing a lot of pain in my right breast, and upper arms.
