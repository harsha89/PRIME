What scares me and made me really particular about finding people in my age bracket are all the scary side effects of chemo such as fertility and all...i went to the young survivors website yesterday and i was amazed at the survivor stories of so many people less than 30. Fumi, are you Nigerian?",

My first regimen was EC * 4 and I finished the last one two weeks ago with minimal side effects. I'm starting taxotere next week and I'm completely freaked out cos of the scary side effects I've been reading so would like personal experiences. Also, been using the scalp cooling which has been really great for my hair but I'm just completely tired of freezing my head for 3hours every 3weeks...confused whether I should just stop and let the hair fall up and grow up back : (  ",

Guess I'm just so tired of the whole chemo process, I'm having 8 cycles and I'm just half way through and I'm really not in the mood to deal with any new side effects as the first regimen was pretty easy and yeah! sometimes I feel I'm not having enough SEs to justify the effectiveness of the drugs but I believe and have faith that it is doing what it's supposed to do. My breast care nurse called today and said I would need to take steroids on the day before the treatment, the day of the treatment and the day after....did u also have to do that? Thanks again... ",

The only snag is having to have the cap on for almost 4hours every time i go in for treatment and that makes my hospital visit considerable longer. Thanks for the advice, might just stick it out...i'm half way through already. Caltex_catlady: I wasn't told about the 12 and 6 hour thing just that I should take 4 tabs twice a day for 3 days but will do the 12 and 6 hour thing, now that i know....thanks. Always have issues with sleeping with steroids though :( ",

Glad to know most SEs are manageable....hugs to those who are finding it a bit more difficult. Today is day 6 of my first cycle(EC) and have had some ups and downs....days 1 and 2 were pretty much a blur as i spent the days in bed. But apart from that, the SEs haven't been so bad except for this nagging chest pain i've had for about three days now. Sometimes breathing becomes so hard and i feel like there's a huge stone blocking my air way. Don't know if anyone else has experienced anything close to that. It gets really painful sometimes and makes sleeping difficult but i'm seeing my onc 2mrw so will discuss it with him. Also i noticed that my tongue is dark around the ages and I haven't been able to eat much since my cycle started....everything tastes flat... Take care ladies and all the best ((((((((((hugs)))))))))))))",
