Pink mottled rash on breast. 10 days on antibiotic....rash is muuuuich lighter, much lighter but not gone. I have no other symptoms and haven't for 2 weeks but of course I'm still terrified bc I know IBC can present with only a rash. :( Let us know what you here, we are rooting for you!!!! Warmly, Missy",
