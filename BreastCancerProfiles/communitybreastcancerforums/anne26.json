Look at others tattos and ask where they got them if you find something you like. I can recommend someone in michigan.  anne",

Also new research indicates that for high risk women having opposite breast removed decreased reoccurrance. I know this is scarybut you will get through this. Having my mastectomy was not bad.

I have whave had the little nagging voice for a whole year and it has been keeping me from completly moving forward.
