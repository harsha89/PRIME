    "Content": "Tobyholicdeb wrote: I was to have my first chemo today but they found out they hadn't ordered an echogram, so I'll try again next week. They started teaching me about my drugs and they told me I couldn't be around any babies or toddlers that had been given any vaccines or immunizations. My first grandchild is arriving within the next week. Does this mean I can't see my grandchild until all this mess is over? And, how do I know when I go out in public if I'll be around children that have just received a shot? Do I stay shut up inside my house, give up my job and stay away from people until this is over? I'm so confused. Log in to post a reply",
