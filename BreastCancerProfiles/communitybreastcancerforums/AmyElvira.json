When guys get older, testosterone goes down, and this can lead to reduced labido.",

I felt a lump in my breast for two years. Doctors, radiologists, sonographers and surgeons told me it was nothing but a grouping of \"harmless cysts\".  I finally put my foot down and INSISTED they take it out.  They rolled their eyes at me, but they did it.  And guess what - it was cancer.  I saved my own life by standing up for myself. You go girl!! Amy",
