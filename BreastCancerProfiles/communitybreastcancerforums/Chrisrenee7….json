Whatever you have packed already you won't need most of it.  Best thing to pack pull on sweats/yoga pants and a button down MENS shirt.  Most likely you will be going home with drain tubes and women's shirts are just too tight in the chest and side areas. 2. chapstick is a must. Once you get to your room your lips will be dry. 3. ribbon- once you are able to take a shower you will need to pin your drain tubes up to something so you don't have to hold them. 4. Don't do too much too soon. 5. When friends ask if they can make you dinner- say yes!   I hope all of you ladies have a speedy recovery and God bless you all!",

After my TE surgery I had a reaction to the Alloderm my PS placed so he put drains in as a preventative. I only had them in for a week, I had 1 on each side.  The exchange surgery was so much easier than BMX and TE surgery. With my first two surgeries I took pain pills for almost a month with Exchange surgery I only took pain pills for 3 days. I was doing laundry on day 4. With my exchange surgery I also did lipo, I hurt more with the lipo than I did with the exchange.",

I was called back the day after my first ever mammo because the radiologist found a mass in both breasts. After doing bilateral biopsies, it came back that the left breast had cancer and the right breast was just a cyst. When talking to my BS she gave the option of lumpectomy or UMX. I told her that neither of those options was what i wanted. I wanted a BMX. So my right breast was a prophy. My downtime for my BMX was 4 weeks. My downtime was longer for my TE placement, that ended up being almost 10 weeks. My exchange surgery downtime was 3.5 weeks and I was back to work on 12/31.",

To me it was the same decision I had to make on deciding to do nips and tattoing. I was deadset on not doing them, then 2 weeks I changed my mind but kept it to myself. For me, I wanted to feel \"normal\" again, or as normal as you can be after being affected by this. Everyone has good points on their arguments and I see everyone's views. Like I said it's a tough decision to make. Karensimone- I hope you make the right decision for you. My thoughts and prayers are with you. christy",

I was really wanting to have recon at that time, and was very upset. I don't regret the delayed reconstruction because I was able to get myself healed before I went for the next surgery. I understand about not wanting to look at yourself in the mirror post surgery. I told my husband I wanted all the mirrors in the house covered up. My husband, said that he was not going to do that and that we were going to face this head on. I have changed my mind on the final stages of recon nips and tattoos so many times. I have finally made the decision to go for the whole shebang. Cancer took my breasts and happiness for a while and with the help of my amazing dr's I'm getting it back. Make your decision for yourself not for anyone else. hugs",

It is the most devastating news any person could get. I was diagnosed on 5/25/12 4 days after 35th birthday. As I was told by my Breast surgeon on my initial consult, it will not change the outcome of the diagnosis iif you wait a month. The diagnosis is there, it's not going to go away. My husband, my mother and myself wen't to the BS on 5/31/12 and my BS said she had an opening for the next day if I wanted it. My husband told her to schedule it, me on the other hand being a workaholic told him absolutely not, I needed to give more notice for work. I had my bilateral mastectomy on 6/5/12. If your wife and yourself are happy with the BETTER surgeon then I would wait. If it's anxiety and the fear of spreading that's a decision unfortunately that your wife will need to make. Whatever decisions ya'll make my best wishes to ya'll. christy",

She should have her certificates hanging near by, you might want to take a peek at them. JMO.",
