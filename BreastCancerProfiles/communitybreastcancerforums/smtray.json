It was found that I had a 4cm tumor on the lining before the brain on the back of my head. Doc moved fast I had surgery and had it removed. I have no side effects. Just very tried. No I am doing radiation only 5 treatments. First one was yesterday and today I'm just really tried. My doctor says my prognosis is very good. Might not need chemo. I just take some kind of pill eve day. I'm trying to be very positive about it all.",
