Im really worried about my mum. she was diagnoised with breast cancer last year and has has her breast removed and had all her treatment. last week, she got her final results and got the all clear, but ever since that day, she has been acting very odd! she seems very confused in her conversation and also seems really distant. its like she is deep in her own though? almost like she is convinced she still has the cancer. is this normal? is she in shock? has anyone else had these symptoms?
