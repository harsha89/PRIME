I am receiving social security disability and even though I know everyone's situation is different, I can't imagine working 40 hoursd a week or for that matter even 4 hours per week. I know you will probably miss those adorable lil kids but def not all those germs and snotty noses they got going on. Physically I am just too exhausted. I plan on using my \"good\" days spending time with first my dh and ds's and then family and friends making good memories and taking lots of pics and videos to remind them and myself of the good times. My body needs extra rest to heal and all tx meant to extend our lives have side effects which usually results in more exhaustion for me. It's a very personal decision for each person. Who gives a rip what other people think of our decision? Other peoples opinion of me is really not my concern. Let them walk in my shoes for a mile and then I MIGHT listen to their opinion. But since walking a mile for me is out of the question at this time, can't see wasting any of my most valuable time in caring what others think I should do. Ok , climbing off my soapbox now. Sorry I got a little long winded there.",

Well about 30 days ago I finally agreed and tried something. I take it at night because it makes me sleepy is the only side effect so far for me. But I feel like a totally different person. Much more like my old self. I am not in a stupor and I can fe emotions but they just kinda roll off my shoulders. My family has def caught the happy emotion I got going in and it's rubbing off more laughter. More talking. I say give if a try. No one but the pharmacist and your dr and you have to know. Right ?",

I don't want to leave him to take care if everything : ds's , finances etc. He has been awesome. I don't want him to have to take care of me and be stuck at home all the time missing life. Only getting out mostly for work or groceries. I want to be able to take care of him , take some load off. I want him to be happy, to be loved fiercely, and to be able to have s life outside this house and the hospital with me. I want great adventures for him. Oh yeah I want that to be me not a new wife. Who's gonna love him as much as I do. We have been together since 1991. 4. Myself. Yes I deserve a good life. Lots of things left I have never done , seen or tried. 5. To glorify god. I want my children and husband and many many more people to see our prayers working. To see a miraculous healing. To bring my family closer to god again.

You will find alot of support and valuable experiences and knowledge here Yes a CT can look suspicious but a biopsy should really be required. Now not only can the biopsy show if it is or is not cancer but in many cases they can actually test biopsy to see which treatment would be most effective. Also need to get full body scan if not yet done. You need to know the whole pic before deciding on treatment. The good news is this is not an immediate death threat. If you look on different threads you will see many people are living long productive life. Many oncologists will actually say now stage iv is a chronic disease. My oncologist doesn't agree but I'll prove him wrong. It is not at all unusual for it to come back after this long. You will hear many stories here like that My cancer came back 11 years later and my stage iv diagnosis was lil over 4 years ago. My mom lived with stage iv over 20 years. Not perfectly healthy care free years but she would def say more good days then bad. An treatment is often much easier then the first round if you had chemo and or radiation. Many ladies start on a daily pill not iv chemo esp if it is er positive. I encourage you to check out some threads here. Jump in anytime with questions or comments. ",

However the bad news is his teacher met dh in the office to say that 4 weeks into school hehas a 0 in math. Wth ??? Apparently he hasn't done any homework and has been goofing off in class Instead of working. He got a zero on a test. Didn't do anything except his name. Math has always been a struggle for him and if he gets a overall grade of C and he tried his best we are happy. All other subject is A and B's. He is very shy and has never ever been even verbally reprimanded at school. So this was a total shock. The school has the gradebook on line for us to use but they don't assign this year's password until parent teacher conferences after nine weeks. Ds1 is in serious trouble. Everyday we discuss what happened at school and do homework at the table together.hehas said he Finished it during study hall. Not like him to lie. Don't understand how he thought he could hide this. So it looks like I am gonna be busy with him every night trying to catch up in math. I hate math also, exp fractions. Hello Google Hugs",

But now they will also be able to reread your text every night if they choose to. I have found that when I puke I like to eat watermelon or chocolate even if it is just a bite. They taste the same coming up or down. At least the puke taste isn't so horrible. And yes our familky. Friends. The world will somehow go on without us. That's so hard for me to grasp. Was just talking to sister about this. Funny how I want to be able to control so much after I die, but I just can't. No matter what they are going to do things their way and we can't control it. Lack of control is te biggest hurdle for me. I remember when my mom was dying and she was fretting for her children who are all successful happy adults. Trying to plan our futures. I couldn't understand - but NOW I do. I like the idea of dying alone quitely under a tree. I want it to be a solitary time for me. Well of course God and angels welcome. I do like the idea of my dh holding my hand but do not want to put him thru that pain. The pain will be hard enough he doesn't need that memory. I will be cremated. I don't want anyone seeing my dead body except funeral personnel. Unfortunately dh will probably see it to call them. I have strict request that my dss don't see it. Of course again truthfully beyond my control. I pray earnestly that dss won't be the one to come in and find me dead. For a really long time I remembered both my parents in a coffin or a hospital bed because of cancer. Finally I can also remember good times but those horrible visions still come with. Anyway just my personal decisions I know some people want to e surrounded by people when their time comes. To each their own. Right ",

Refills for him is never a problem and hospital stays he always gives me a demerol pain pump to control my own pain. His nurse says he is like this with all patients. Just doesn't seem right to have cancer patients living in constant pain. My problem is the insurance. Not the pharmacist fault. Insurance is extremely strict about refills. They only allow a refill 1 day before prescription ends. One pain med is for 30 days and 1 is for 27 ( the insurance allows a max qty written at one time ) so I have to go pharmacy twice in one week. Grr. Once a year they allow an early refill of 3 days for vacation. There is also 1 hospitalists who always tries to limit my pain meds at hospital but thankfully my Mo over rides his order. ",

We have never ever been apart that long.  He has been having a very hard time dealing with cancer and seeing me in so much pain.  He had been nearly impossible to pry him from my side. He has missed a lot of fun activities because he is scared to leave me. He is very shy also. So I am hoping he will get there, get relaxed and have a blast. It's time he focuses on having fun, laughing and smiling.  He has put ona brave face about going but as the departure date grew closer his fear has started to show.  Dh and I have pushed him to go anyway.  Dh took him to church this am for departure. I was afraid if I went I would cry and then ds would cry and want to stay home - I probably would have let him.   Youngest ds goes next week but he is very outgoing. Not worried about him at all.   It is hard for all parents to let go I'm sure. Any suggestions?  An adult we know well from church will be at camp all week and he said ds can call us in his cell phone or we can call him anytime we want.  They just left 2 hours ago and are not even at camp yet but I am struggling not to call and check on him. Trying not to call at all and just let him call us if necessary.  I did write a note encouraging him and put in in his backpack to be found later and also got him a new friendship like  bracelet so he can have a little reminder of home.   I guess that is enough rambling.  Time to cut the apron strings - I guess :-(. ",

My oldest no longer wants his parents to drop in for lunch at school started last year. My youngest still loves it. Dh and I usually separately try to have lunch with him at least 1 per month each since kindergarten. Well due to crazy back pain , and limited mobility I haven't made it much this year. Thankfully dh still goes. Well ds has been asking every week if not daily for me to go and I just can't. So finally this weekend I was doing pretty good so I said I would try for Mondays lunch. Well lol and behold Sunday night I start with the big d , crazy vomiting , major weak and way too dizzy to drive. Ds is disappointed but ok.watching his disappointment I PROMISED to go one day this week. We never break promises that's how we trust one another and we tell them that all the time. So it's Friday and I am not much better def can't drive and even if I just rode with someone really to weak to walk all the way to the school cafeteria. This am he reminded don't forget 12 lunch you promised. Even though he can hear me vomiting like crazy to him it's still a promise. I talked to Ds briefly and explained surely he wouldn't want me to have a big D accident at school in front of his classmates and that it was not safe for me or anyone else for me to drive so dizzy. He said I understand no prob I get hugs and kisses and he's off. Dh told me on the way to school he noticed ds crying in the backseat. Ds says because mom broke her promise and she's never done that. He's scared of me dying soon Dh comforts him best he can but now s he is having a hard day at school and I am sitting here crying I never should have promised for sure and he shouldnt have to worry about his mom dying damn cancer Sorry for the long post I had to get it out",

Hopefully not too sad but rather some smiles or laughs as people can relax and remember. The funeral home would not do prepayment since the balance is so small - like $750 I believe. However they let me and asnyone else. Go ahead and fill out the necessary paperwork including the permission agreement for cremation. I also provided obituary info that is included in the price go run in our local paper 3 days. I kept a copy of all in our safe and their phone number is on many magnets on the fridge. They also have an ambulance company so one call shopping if you will. If I die at home being stage IV no coroner required. Trying to make it easy as poss for family. I've also done most things on the death, dying bag someone else posted - I think Jill - I can't remember. I wasn't dwelling on death. I just feel so much better knowing all is ready. My family will be able to relax and grieve. No stress about what I want or arguments between family members. No rush trying to get so much done.

In the er I've been stuck more than a dozen times each time trying to find a vien that won't blow. The last two times they did a central line in my neck. Was very painful. And even guided by machine it took many attempts. Not only was it painful but it delayed my treatment of uncontrollable vomiting and diarrhea by more than 4 hours. So frustrating. Now that I have a port home health can treat me at home with iv nausea meds and antibiotics and fluids. Not going to the hospital is well worth it. I just thought my port placement was wrong but it looks like it's totally normal. I got my pamphlet out they gave me during port placement and apparently it's also a bard power port.

This year however I am ready to see them more often but am freaking out about them being home all day.  Now I usually rest and sleep during the day so I have the energy to spend about 3 hours in the evening with them. I hate the idea of them sitting around all summer watching me sleep or be sick or be in uncontrollable pain.  Due to pain med causing dizziness I hesitate to sign them up for some fun classes throughout the summer for fear of not being able to deive them so just throwing money down the drain.  Anybody else freaking out over this too ?  How are others planning for summer break?  ",

Having s problem with anger and finding a good release for it and also getting them out of the house without me. Last week the counselor came and just did history/paperwork. Today he just played board games to get to know each other better. So hoping this makes a difference for our whole family. Cancer changes so much in our lives. Where oh where did normal go ? Also it's been spring break here this week. Anybody else have kids on spring break ? Any fun ideas of what to do that don't require alot of walking? We've went o the movies. They played laser tag and went bowling one day. I am all out of ideas for a 10 &14 year old",
