      "Content": "midwestmama wrote: I had my biopsy today. Procedure itself was fine, much less scary than I was expecting. I learned minutes before the procedure that I was a BIRADS 4b, due to linear microcalcifications found in one spot on my right breast. It took a week to get into my biopsy, and over that week I have sort of convinced myself that I probably have cancer. Maybe not the most helpful mindset, but that's the way my mind has gone. I'm only 30, no family history, very healthy, just finished 3+ years of almost uninterrupted breastfeeding (a few months off between kids). This is my report I just received right before my biopsy: \"There are linear microcalcifications which are not clearly vascular. The right breast microcalcifications are indeterminate and a biopsy is recommended. BIRADS 4b. Parench: dense\" I guess I'm just looking for a little bit of hope that it could be benign...I just weaned my son a few weeks ago, after 18 months of breastfeeding, and the radiologist mentioned that it *could* have something to do with lactating...but I haven't read that anywhere else. It was also determined I have a galactocele last week, at the test where they recommended the biopsy. I'm worried sick. Has anyone had similar findings that turned out to be benign? I could use a little hope. Log in to post a reply",

When I had first read \"not clearly vascular\" I thought that sounded bad, so I'm glad to know that is a positive thing. I'm feeling a little more hopeful today. Praying I get results early Monday.",
