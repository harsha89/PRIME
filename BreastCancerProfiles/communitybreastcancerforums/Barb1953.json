I had'nt even heard of LE. My radiation onc sent me to therapy.I had masssage therapy everyday for one week. They taught me how to wrap my arm,which I did everynight for a few months. I also wear a sleeve& gauntlet ---every day at first, but now I only wear it when doing anything strenuous, likeyard work. It does seem worse in the hot weather. I can usually tell when I need to put my sleeve on, my are feels real heavy. So far mine is pretty much under controll. Good Luck to you.",
