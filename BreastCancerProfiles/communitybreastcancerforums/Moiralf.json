I had a noticable lump in my right breast and I had a mammogram. I was told \"no problem\" all good. At the time I hesitated and thought how could that be? But I trusted the docotors and the hospital and went on with my life. A year later the lump was still there, not really bigger but not smaller either. At a doc appt I mentioned it again and the doc sent me for mammo and ultrasound. This time it was immediately dx as cancer and I ended up with stage 4. I will never know if this would have happened anyway but i kick myself everyday for not pushing harder at the time for better answers.I didn't know I should have had an ultrasound as well. I didn't want to be a nuisance and thought they knew better than me and so I stayed quiet and went home. I don't blame anyone, no-one did it on purpose and it doesn't dominate my thoughts BUT I wish I had pushed harder. Please demand(nicely) to have whatever it takes to do everything to get a definite answer. Mammos can make mistakes, more often than we realise.  Remember most lumps are benign and again I don't want to panic you. Just encourage you to stand up hard for yourself. It is your health and life that is on the line.  I wish you all the best and look after yourself. Moira ",

She is 23 and I would prefer her to remember me as a happy, fun person, not a sad crying one. I found that going to a counsellor was my best outlet for the worst of my fears. Then I could talk about anything and it didn't hurt anyone but I could release the most deepest fears and then move on and find some peace for a while. I did that for the first 6 months or so and again when I had progression. Haven't been for a while and have moved since then so will have the problem of finding a new counsellor. I could rant and rave and cry and she would acknowledge my fears and somehow I would get a handle on them in my mind. My DH went to the same centre but had a male counsellor. He too found it helpful and he is not a talking kind of guy.  I never asked what they talked about but he found the same release and acceptance I did, I think. Moira",

That's assuming I had to get stupid cancer in the first place. Makes me feel a bit small and mean but it is just a thought and it passes. If you sat around thinking it all day everyday it might mess with your head but an occasional wishful thought is perfectly normal. In my family my brother died of melanoma cancer at 45 in 2002, i got bc at 44 in 2007 and my elderly mum got stage 1 bc in 2010. So I sort of think, I have all these in my head.\" Glad to not be my brother\"(that's mean), \"sucks to be me but I'm living ok\", and \"how come my elderly mum got a fixable type of bc.\" But they are passing thoughts, then I come back to it all being it is what it is. Such is life. It shows what are good person you are that you have even noticed that it might not be ok to think bad thoughts. It's entirely natural. We think it's ok to wish we had been the one to win the lottery and all those millions so why not the not so happy stuff. It's like  a wistful sadness of what should have been. Then it passes and on we go looking for the good and blessings we have in each day. Pollyanna on. can't be pollyanna everyday, would end up killing someone with pent up annoyance and rage.lol Moira",

Recently shifted from the North Island to the South Island. They were very creative with the island naming when the Europeans settled here!! I am 50 now and just had a party to celebrate. Way keener to celebrate life's achievements than before BC. I have been married to a wonderfully imperfect man for 28 years and have 2 grown daughters. Neither married and no grandchildren. They are 23 and 27 so there should be GBs but no, modern women are too busy! I was dx from the get-go with stage4. Had a mamo the year before that should have shown the lump I could feel but gave me an all clear instead. That was Nov 2007. Scans after mast shown 1 met to spine. Had rads. Took Tamox for 2 1/2 years before it failed and then megace which did nothing and got mets in both hips and sprinkles up my spine. Had rads and Xeloda and got to NED in early 2011. Had a complete break from treatment for 6 months until TMs rose higher again and onto femara for the last year and a bit.  I've been very lucky that with all the treatments so far I have had few side effects. Really hoping that continues with all future ones. Not going to worry about that yet. I am an early childhood teacher and love the under 5 age group. Feel very passionate about the way the early years experience affects children though until adulthood. Not working right now as the shift south meant I had to leave my job and finding it a time to reflect and decide if I want to do something else. Plus it harder to find a job down here, people seem to love their jobs and don't shift, how rude, I need higher unemployment for me. Still thinking that the right job will come along when it is suppose to. Patience in waiting for anything is not my forte. Scans and doc appt require pills to see me though. Like now when I am due to see onc in early Feb, and he is going to ask for scans. Waiting for results is the worst thing. Oh almost forgot I have 4 cats. No dogs, we had to put our little foxy to sleep before our move, she was just too old and sick to have managed it. We had put it off too long anyway but I felt like we had done it just cos of the move. The cats should only be 2 but we rescued a couple before we shifted and couldn't leave them behind. Now I have a \"gang\" of cats. The support and unity this board gives women from all over the world is something I treasure. I would never have been able to find this understanding without the internet. Day or night you know someone is there. Moira",

I have a tattoo on my lower forearm that reads \" Whilst we live, let us live\" I have the number of years since the start of this worked around the words. On my anniversary each year I cross out the last number and add the new one. 5 is my new lucky number. I'm proud of that and will take those numbers to the grave. My onc jokes I might run out of room going up my arm. I told him that I could live with that.  Guilt is negative and gives nothing, just like fear. Look for positives like happiness, pleasure, laughter, hugs smiles kisses. Feels better when you do that. Moira ",

Not all docs use them as they are not very reliable and do not neccessary measure cancer growth. In saying that, my onc does use the CA15-3 test. The normal score would be under 35. That would sort of say no cancer. From the get go I was 45 on the CA15-3. That was 4 years ago and I was stage 4 from the start. My markers do show \"trends\" for me. My onc uses them to see if I need scans to check. A couple of years ago my markers started trending up and I will say well above your mum's numbers. I went for scans three times, every three months and the first 2 scans showed nothing. Clear scans.  The third one showed a small growth in my hip bones. I was at 1400 by then. That took 9 months of tumour markers doubling and rising rapidly.  Had rads to the area and went onto Xeloda. 8 cycles of that(24 weeks) I was back to 25. So you can imagine how happy I was with that. Now after 6 months of no treatment my markers rose to 100 and my onc put me on Femara. Each months markers have doubled and now stand at 400. Hoping that it is just femara taking a while to kick in. Just had my bloods done and I will visit my onc next Wed to get results. He has said that if it is still rising he would like scans to check things out. Scans are the important tool to see what is happening. The tumour markers are an indicatior for some people.  Most definitely not everyone. The important thing to realise is that if your mum has never had one done before thay have no base number for her. 70 might be fine for her. The scans are the answer for seeing what is happening. That is what I most want to stress. Yes, the waiting and the stress is hell and hard on everyone but it is just one of the neccessary evils we have to go though. Lots of women take some sort of anti-anxiety pill to help take the worst of the stress. Worrying for your mum is normal and it is lovely that you care but things might not be too bad. Hold onto that for now. She has had some wonderful time between each occurance and at the moment  that is still true. Circle the wagons, do what you can to remain calm and get the scans now to know what if anything you need to start dealing with. By the way, yes you are right infections can make your markers rise. Trust in the Lord and let Him walk with you as you go though the next few weeks. Hope it goes well for you and your Mum. I will be thinking of you. Moira",

The guy measured me in real detail and a glove too. I got it free from the DHB so that was brilliant. The down side of that is that it had no effect at improving the swelling. Mine is all over the arm, the hand can get quite swollen. Especially with the glove ON. It gets worse with the glove so how weird is that. I have had three diferent types of gloves and none of them seem to work.  As far as I have known no-one teaches wrapping in NZ. Maybe one to two but they would be the odd one. From what I have seen being in Dunedin I would doubt that anyone is well trained in LE. The hosp person responsible seems to only do ordering sleeves and short term wrapping for no more than a week. They do not encourage continued wrapping. The massage people don't know anything about wrapping and how good their training in LE is really I don't know. Most of them seem to do general massage more than LE. It is frustrating to be caught in the middle and have no idea what to do to even to try to help myself. Still I will continue with lymp node drainage and MLD massage plus seeing the LEist to do her thing once a week. No idea about what I am going to do about a sleeve. I would like to try a lymphadiva sleeve but just not sure about what I should get.  Grrr. moira",

I think I will try, again, with the physio at the hospital and see if I am due a new sleeve and if she can point me in the right direction for buying the wrappings and doing it myself. If that doesn't work out I will see about getting the stuff from that website Carol. Obviously my hand and arm don't respond like they should to standard treatments, otherwise the things I have been trying would work. That's no reason to stop trying and give up as far as I am concerned. I really don't like being told NO or can't help you. I beg your pardon I think you will help me or I will nag you until you are sick of me. Plus I then go out and look for my own solution.

That was from my LE therapist in Palmy Nth. Came down to Dunedin and LEist at hosp wrapped for one week and said no more and don't bother as it hadn't made too much difference. Sleeve doesn't really help either but they have nothing else to offer. Now paying to see another LEist and she does things quite different to the others. But she knows nothing about wrapping or sleeves. Meanwhile I'm standing here going \"Fix my g**damn hand and arm\" I'm happy to work on doing my own bit but I'm not an expert and the more people I see the more confused I end up. Massage in Palmy was paid for by hosp and got one set of garments per year. No massage in Dunedin and no mention of getting sleeves. If you want anything you have to pay for it. I'm seriously thinking about doing my own wrapping but worry about making things worse by not knowing how to get the tension right. I've had the kinsio(sp) tape before and it did nothing for me but anything is worth a try. I aquajog now and even if the water flow does nothing for my arm I enjoy the movement in the water and thinking I am helping my health generally. Will be interested to see if the wrapping works on your arm. Moira",

Google maps sent me there a few times until it worked out where I was based from. Kind of fun though to see somewhere else. Musical I have had OTS sleeves that have fitted fine and custom made one too but they just don't seem to move any fluid. Except my hand which blows up like a puffer fish if I wear a glove.  For wrapping do you use cotton padding under the bandages or just straight bandages on skin? LEist used cotton tube over arm then padding wrapped around hand and arm and then bandages over the top. Did she give you the wrapping or did you have to buy it. Pretty sure I would have to buy everything myself. Ok if it worked but not sure what to do. Moira",

Funny I thought where could everyone be. Thought I would drive down through the little town and check if they were shopping. Then I spotted my brothers van outside the hospital. Quick u-turn and WTH moment. My mum had just been rushed to hospital after my sister found her collapsed in her garden. I had just missed the ambulance when I stopped in. Luckily it was heat exhaustion from hours spend gardening in warm weather and a  slight heart turn as well. Seriously  I told her I was the only one in the family allowed to have any health issues and she had to stop trying to steal my thunder and wait her turn. It made her laugh but ye gods it scared me. She is  a hardy old woman but still 86 nearly 87 is getting up there. I went home shaking a bit too and thinking about the future, Chris. Crying is good for the soul and we can both give thanks to whoever we please that it was not more serious. Guess they have lots of instructions what to look for over the next few days.

No putting it off or say Maybe later or I don't deserve that. I work less but still teach cos I love it and it makes me feel young but it done on my terms. So whatever the future holds I don't know. It is not for me to know. My business is living today and today I spent it with my dh and had lots of fun, just being together. I thank God that he walks with me on this journey and when I stumble He gives me strength to dust myself off and get my feet under me and move forward again. And a very big thank you to the many women I have met on these boards and the wonderful support and knowledge they have so generously given.

I was dx stage 4 nearly 5 years ago and my CA15-3 was around 45, had one bone met in spine. Was treated with radiation and tamoxifen. About 18 months later my markers started to rise and onc scanned, showed nothing. Three months later TMs higher again around 400 this time, scanned again, still clear. I think he waited for another three months and markers were 900 and scanned and I think this is when they found a small met in my hip. Had radiation  again and then megace which didn't work and TMs went to 1400, another met in other hip. Had Xeloda and with 8 cycles had TMs of 25. Since then I have had a break of all treatment until my markers headed up again after about 9 months and then I went on Femara and again at the beginning my markers were 1000ish,think I had a scan and had small spine mets, onc not that concerned, now back to 675 and dropping. No problem with my spine and I feel no pain. So from my experience only, scanning is great but in many cases it cannot pick up mets until they are a certain size. My onc also said they can't tell if the protein that is measured is a lot coming from a few cells  or small amounts coming from many. Not all of which will grow to anything. That sounds confusing but it sort of makes sense. The anxiety of going for scans and waiting for results was difficult for me and now I would wait until my markers showed up really high. That is me, that is what I have learned is true for me. That is not the same for everyone. My onc was surprised that nothing showed up when I was around 400 but it didn't. And if I had any noticable symptoms that were new for me I would be getting scans. Normal for CA 15-3 is under 35 so 44 is still very close and it sounds like they are rising incredibly slowly, mine sort of doubled each time so you can see the difference.  You could scan just for peace if mind and to feel like you are being proactive but the change to your treatment will be the same no matter when it happens, small or big doesn't make that much difference. One of the weird things about this is how onc say that to us. Getting mets early or a little later is not the problem, the way we each response to treatment is what matters.  Not sure if that helps but it is how it was for me. Your onc is watching closely and if you feel any symptoms that is also something he will want to know. He is right, 44 is still very low, but it is fair enough to be concerned. Moira ",

Unfortunately the prelim look my onc had at the scan today showed a couple more masses and some smaller and some larger of the old ones He did admit it needed to be read by the rad tec but it looked like progression to him. So he is moving me onto FEC to try and get these unwelcome visitors gone. He did say FEC was a more heavy duty chemo than Taxol, which was deemed mild. My hair is already cut down to a number 3 of thats ok but I wondered what others had noticed as SEs. And what success or failure had they found doing this protocol. It will be three weekly so I'm guessing,: ok, bad, worse, bit better ok, good, treatment time and off we go again. Don't know how long I will be doing it. Will see my onc is 4 weeks for blood tests. Any help welcomed, I'm a bit down that Taxol didn't do it for me. I've been lucky with others in the past so have to be realistic that it was bound to happen sooner or later.

I know you don't expect us to be able to fix it but it's really important to vent the frustration here. Getting good service for lymphedema is very hit and miss. I live in New Zealand and am finding it difficult to find people who know what they are talking about. My arm seems resistant to compression but the LE therapists don't seem to have too many other options for me. I use the sleeve I got custom made but it doesn't make a difference and my hand swells more if I wear the glove. Working out my own treatment now and finding aqua walking and arm movements might be helping. Insurance is a big issue I hear in America, here most stuff is through public health but they don't fund everything and there can be long delays in treatment. Then we can pay privately if we can afford it. Can get private health insurance but it is costly and not offer through employment.  Not until you need it that you realise how difficult dealing with anything attached to it can be.  Hope this gets sorted for you but yeah, it's just something else you don't need.

No chemo for me.I was not happy, I felt fine but they won't do it if there is any chance it could cause a worse problem. Have to agree with that, even if I was gutted. So try again Monday, take temperature as soon as I sit down please. All ok this time and off we go. I take Emend and Zofran as a premed at home before 1st day treatment, then emend at night.Plus Dex for three days. Today and tomorrow I take emend in morning. After that I have another anti nausea which I take as needed. Can't remember it's name. Feeling ok today, queasy last night and went to bed early. Taxol use to hit me on day three so I'm sort of waiting to see how tomorrow goes. Anticipating SEs is half the brother of getting them.

One of the hard things about stage 4 is comparing yourself to everyone else with stage4. It's very hard to keep prospective and realise that each case is very individual. The thoughts go though your head, \"That's me\" \"When will it be my turn\" \"If it can happen so fast to her it could do that to me\" Panic is hard to describe in this situation but I have been there myself a number of times. I guess it some hard reality check that, yes this could be me and it's not just a possibility but at some point the reality. I'm thinking that for me it was a bit of time and the reassurance that everyone is different. Maybe spending bit of time with your mum and letting her talk about how that impacted on her and then very gently try to help her see that she is not exactly the same and right now she is still ok. It is not easy for us to get our head in the right space sometimes, especially when we see the end result staring us in the face. Denial is part of coping and death removes that barrier for a while. Maybe talking about caring for your father in the future and your mum knowing plans are being discussed and taken seriously will help her to relax and know she has some control back and her mind will settle. I would ask that you treat this seriously and with respect. I would have found it incredibly difficult if when it happened to me my loved ones brushed it aside and minimized how much it affected me. Some people don't want to talk about it and use the terms; Your fine, get over it and it won't happen to you. To me that would have been to disregard the very real feelings of dread and fear I was having at that time. Give her reassurance and listen to her and be gentle. Time will probably help to calm her. I'm sure you have done those things and I don't mean to imply you have not taken it seriously. You wouldn't be here asking if you didn't care very much for how this is effecting her. Just letting you know how it is for me and how I would want it treated. Hope your mum feels better soon. There is a very real grieving that we do for our future loss. Moira",

Being happy and enjoying any type of food is going to make you feel better and enjoying each day is what life is all about. There is no magic bullet to stop cancer. Diet and exercise is great and important but living each day as happily and at peace with yourself is more so, at lest to me. I've got bone mets and have had them for 5 years. Had a couple of progressions and currently on femara. Doing fine. I think you are trying really hard to do everything \"right\" and I don't think there is any such thing. Just life in all it's glory. Don't be too afraid to live for today and that means being happy. Just my opinion and as long as you feel what you're doing is right for you that is the main thing.  Be happy Moira ",

How we do that is different for each person but there is much to live for, even with a stage 4 dx. I was dx wit bone mets nearly 6 years ago. I'm still going strong and no-one would ever know if I chose not to tell them. Imagine if I had not managed to overcome that shock and fear? I would still be alive but all that time would have been wasted and given over to fear. And believe me there was a great deal of shock and fear. I was devastated but I had to learn to fight through that and find someway to be happy again.  I refuse to allow cancer to take any more from me that it absolutely has to. If your wife has not already seen a doctor for her fears I would encourage her to do so. She may need anti-depressants to lift her mood and allow her to focus on moving forward. There is no shame in admitting we need help and many here take anti-depressants plus anti-anxiety meds to help us cope.  Counselling with a skilled therapist who knows how to deal with cancer clients is also very beneficial. It can be a place to share all her fears in a safe place and in doing that come to terms with how to get the most out of her life. It took me a good 6 months of counselling to feel I had reached a place where I could understand myself and the cancer. I still go back when things change and I need help to readjust. It may help her understand why she is avoiding certain foods. It may be one way she feels she can control things when so much else is out of control. None of what she has gone though and is still going though is easy, in fact it is damn hard work. She has worked hard to get herself mobile again and then the rug has been pulled out from underneath her. Make sure she knows what courage it took for that hard work and how together you will get through this too. She does not need to fear so much and there are things that can be done to help but she needs to step forward and decide she will fight for each day to be a blessing and not let the cancer steal that day. Be her loving support, remind her about those grandchildren. She does not have to fear but she will need help, she is not alone. Let her see this, remind her there are women here who do understand. There are many years let to be lived.  Thank you too for being the support you are to her. It is very hard on our families and our dear husbands want so much to make it all better when it can't be done. Take care of yourself and together you can move through this. Moira",

He wasn't too worried and put me on Femara. Haven't had a scan since but TMs are coming down nicely which for me means it is working. Will scan in Nov to check if we are on the right track.  Only had pain once when I had pain in right hip from mets. They don't always cause pain. If you hadn't had the scans you wouldn't have known. My onc tells me I'm asymtomatic. No real signs things are happening. Lucky me, I won't even be sick it it wasn't for scans and blood tests. Well, I would be but I wouldn't know. By the time I did feel it the chances are it could be too late. So,while I curse the tests for smacking me with reality, they are also saving me. Still many treatments yet for you and the amount of mets are not as important as how you respond to any treatment.  I'm with the others who says enjoy your holiday and do everything you can to relax.

That can be very confusing and bewildering. There is no way to tell the future so you must weight the options and decide what is best for your mum as events happen. Her body is still healthy and that is great and it sounds like it is still in her bones so that is another plus.  Has she used any of the other hormonals other than arimdex? Is that not being suggested after rads? I know that the hospital is one of the best so you know you are getting good advice. I have heard that rads can make quite a difference to the pain of masses that block the spine. I had it to mets in my hips and it did make the pain go away, it can continue to work for a while afterwards so the end of rads is not necessarily the end of the benefits. This is a very difficult time for you all and it does take a little time to get your feet under you again and take a deep breath and look at what is next. Keep asking questions and then move forward and look after each other. Your mum has battled back once already so she sounds like she will have a good chance of giving this new one a chance to work on the mets. I am sure others will come along soon and have some more info on rads and on using gemzar. Hope it is a good one for her and the SEs are gentle on her. Moira",

I regret I did not push to have my lump double checked the year earlier. I didn't know I should have had an ultrasound and my doc didn't bother. It is likely to still not be cancer but for some reason  you are having pain and that tells you that something is not behaving as it should. Advocate for yourself. Professional med people can still get it wrong or not be thorough enough. This is your body and you need to be assertive in looking after it.  Even if it is for your own piece of mind and it is not serious. Better safe than sorry as the old  sage advice goes. You can't go back and change things after it has happened.   Can you go back and ask for the next check? Or another doc? Mammos and ultrasounds are good but not without mistakes so that needle or core biopsy is the final answer. 10 years is much too long to wait. It's not their bodies giving pain and lumps, it's yours. Jump up and down. ask pretty please, beg but get peace of mind with a more definite test. Don't let them fob you off. Best of luck and I truly hope it is not too serious. Moira",

Onc don't always know about pain and a pain specialist or palliative care are much better and knowledgeable. Palliative care is not about end-time treatment but how to deal with the chronic aspects of cancer. After about 6 months I dropped meds down slowly and now only take pain meds when needed. But boy will I be jumping up and down if and when the pain comes back. Please get something that works to deal with pain. Stress is bad enough but pain drains everything out of you and mentally is so difficult. It's hard to be upbeat and positive if you are hurting. It's not fair and you deserve to be able to live in relative comfort. Hoping you get something soon and the scans are ok. I have had three progressions in bone mets and now waiting for scans to check rising TMs. But I have been doing this for over 5 years and it still scares the begeebees out of me and I worry about what treatment is next. But there are lots of options so I hold onto that. Let us know how you get on, you are not alone. Moira",

Went on Tamoxifen and had rads to the area. Great for 2 1/2 years and then had tumours in both hips. More rads and then onto Xeloda. After 8 cycles of treatment I was in complete remission. That was in may and I am now having no treatment and going great again. I will move onto the hormonals sooner or later as I am now showing post menopausal blood markers. So, I have just \"celebrated\" 4 years as a stage 4.  I work full time, raise my family and love life. It has not always been easy at all. There is a lot of fear and anger, especially at the beginning but it does not have to dominate your life. Get your treatment plan, rally your support and look after yourself.  Be kind to yourself and don't let cancer rule you. Some days you can be strong and determined to fight and other days you go \"Why Me?' Both are perfectly acceptable.  We are strong women but not super women. I think in some ways I have made better choices and made my life more fulfilling since the cancer than before. I now know I don't have time to worry about the small stuff and I do have time to laugh and make memories for those I love. I wish I didn't have this sucky disease but I do expect to be around for some time yet to plague my girls and love my husband. This board is a truly wonderful place to find info, ask questions and receive support. The amazing thing too is that it comes from all around the world, from women and men you would never met in any other way. Hope everything is coming together for you.  There is so much to take on all at once. Remember to breathe and take time to think things over. All the best.  Moira ",

My mets are in the bone so can't help with the liver but treatments are often along the same lines. You could get rads to  the hip if it is causing pain and there are many hormone treatments that you don't seem to have used yet. Xeloda is an excellent chemo if that is needed and the se's can be ok for most. There is lots to try yet and the very worst part is the waiting to know what the heck is going on. Deep breaths and try not to go to the scary places of your mind. Ok, that's really tricky but as best you can remember that until you know the facts, and even not entirely then, you simply don't not what is going to happen next. This is a one day at a time journey. The fact is was so long between re-occurrences suggest you do response to treatments, so hold onto that. Those biopsy results might prove interesting to. Things can change. Come here when you need to and I sure you will get many more replies from those who have had treatment for the liver too. Moira",

For them communication of feelings is like pulling teeth.  Where we live there is a pysh/oncology group of trained psychologists at the university. Though our local hospital we can have free counselling with these guys. It has been a life saver for me and although my husband didn't use it as much as I did, he did go and found it helpful.  Even now, 4 years later he will say I think I need to talk to them again. He hasn't so far, as like your husband he is very busy at work this year. I think his mental and emotional health  is more important than work but I leave it up to him to decide. But if I think he is struggling and needs to go I will put my foot down and insist.  Is there anything like that in your area? Sometimes talking to someone a step removed can be more helpful than someone with closer connections. He can say anything to them and not hurt their feelings or put them in a difficult position of not knowing what to say. Even though they can talk to us I know my husband doesn't like to express his fears to me as he doesn't want me to see that. Talking to a neutral person is one way he can let those fears out in a safe place. Depends to if your DH is a talker. Some men prefer to do physical stuff as a relief and for us women we have no idea why that works but men are wired different so that is my reasoning. Just spending time with  other male friends doing guy stuff might be the support he finds most useful. I think when we get so busy in our daily lives we forget to make time to relax and look after ourselves. Just as we need to care for our emotional and mental needs so do our partners. Your husband sounds like he is doing everything he can to help you and support his family. It is great that you realise he needs to be looked after too. Working together to look after each other will keep you strong as a team. You sound like you are looking out for each other and that is a wonderful thing. Keep the love strong and you can face anything together. Moira ",

I have no real advice as such but doing the biopsy could have set off your lymph nodes. They respond to activity in the body and can flare up after such things. If they stay up you might need to visit the doc sooner but hopefully they settle down in the next few days.  There is not too much you can do until you get those results and even then they may schedule more tests. It's part of the determining, is it, isn't it?? and it can take time. It's hard to wait though and some people use an anti-anixiety pill to get though so that could be an option for you. Try to do things that take your mind off it. Anything that works for you. Keeping busy, being with friends, running a marathon, scrubbing your house from top to bottom. It's easy to say but really hard to do but try. Don't let fear dominate. Until you have the facts in front of you, you don't have to do anything. Fear achieves nothing and robs you of any peace and normality you have.  Another thought, could you contact the doc's office and speak to the nurse and see if you can be seen sooner. The results are usually available before two weeks. Plus they might want to see you about the lymph nodes. All the best and really hope for good things. Moira",

Scans are the actual test to follow TMs. My TMs are a good indicator but they had to rise to 1400 before my mets showed up on scans.

They can indicate a need to scan if they start rising in large jumps. Also, treatments need time to start working so TMs can rise for a few months before dropping Does depend which chemo your mum is on.

Nope. Have no experience with that sort of lump but as you know it is better to get the answer quickly and know what you are dealing with. Your doc sounds like he is thinking ahead and saving you having to run around having scans and then more scans like your mum. Not very re-assuring I guess but so much better than dragging it out like you have already experienced. Take the same advice you got when this was your mum,one day at a time until you know what you are dealing with.  My mum got bc a couple of years after me. So we are a switch on your situation(but you don't even know yet, so hold on). It was not considered genetic as she was so old(82) when she got it that it was just luck of the draw. She got stage0 lobular and I got stage 4 ductal. I know which of us won that lottery. You know that it has been only been there to the touch for a couple of months and you did all the right things in being aware and then not over panicking and giving it time to resolve, then taking it to the doc. Hope your ultrasound and anything else show no problem but you have all the experience to know what to ask and to make sure they do the right tests to check. That is a positive out of your mum's problems. You won't let them muck you about and you will know exactly how far they need to go to make sure they get the correct and final answer. That gives you some power and control over this. Wish none of us needed to know but at lest knowledge is power. Fingers crossed for your scans and please let us know. Sometimes life sucks big ones.

Got radiation to the vertebras around the met too. Went on Tamoxifen and this worked for me for 2 1/2 years. Then mets to right hip. More radiation and mets then found in left hip so spot weld to that one small met. Xeloda for 8 cycles and NED. I can return to using Xeloda again in the future so didn't stay on that as a maintaince treatment which is also possible. Back to a wait for over 9 months with no treatment until my markers moved up again. Now femara as I am now post menopausal. Should mention I was 45 when this started. 3 months on femara and markers dropping nicely. So hoping  for a long run on this. So have done 4 1/2 years and doing fine. Have been extremely lucky that I have very few side efforts from any of the drugs so far. I know how lucky I am with that. I use anti depressants to help keep my anxiety in the coping zone. I exercise because studies show that might help and I get counselling from a wonderful cancer experienced counsellor when I need it and I needed it a lot in the beginning where you are now. It's very scary and right now no-one can tell you what your journey will be but it is quite likely that you will indeed be there to see that graduation and so many other wonderful things before that.  Be aware of taking time to get your head around all this. It takes some time and cannot be hurried. Be kind to yourself and remember to breathe. Funny advise I know but sometimes that is all you  can do right in minute. This site has so much information that can keep you informed without scaring you sh****ss. Watch out for searching the internet. All the very best for your appts for the coming days and weeks.

I made that as a  sort of highlight cos to my way of thinking that is no where near a state to give up on.  Some drugs that have lower % response may still work. What if she was one of the ones who fell into the successful group. Lots of cancer drugs have quite lowish response rate if we but knew it but it's the best we have right now. My onc told me Taxol has only a 30 % response rate, sadly for me I hit the 70% boo hoo but now I'm trying FEC which has a 50% rate. Still not the 100% we would all like. And Taxol has been very successful for lots of women. It's just the way the cookie crumbles. Back to the ribs, Chrissy is right, rads are used more for pain. Apparently I have mets all up my spine, numerous ribs and both hips. I have had rads to both hips when at one point they became painful. Other that had I have no pain at all from any of the others. I don't even know which ribs and I don't care while they are not causing me any pain. When they do or a rib breaks or does something hellish wrong I will be screaming outside my onc door for getting it fixed now now now. Your onc seem a bit standoffish and pessimistic to me but that is only from hearing what you have told us. Do you have the option of seeking a second opinion. Not all treatments will result in worse SEs and check with the onc or pain specialist as to what can be done to alleviate her pain, or weakness. Seems from what you have said that she is willing to try.  Look for food she can eat and enjoy. Small and often worked for me with Taxol when it gave me a hard time. Onc reduced dose by 20% and most of that disappeared. Didn't work for me but them's the breaks. At least I didn't have to do 13 weeks of trying with nausea and heartburn. FEC which is highly emetic(vomit making) is completely controlled by my anti nausea meds. I thank them every time I take one. Don't give up. You sound strong both for you and your mum. Push a bit harder and insist they try new things for her. Or get them to tell you where else to go to get the answers you want. If it  is only in her bone yet as I think you said so, most of what she is going through is being caused by her treatments not her cancer or at least that is how I am reading it. Food wise, I found things like porridge, mashed potatoes, custard, yoghurt, dry crackers with a little cheese were more settling in my stomach. I called it my white diet. Some use shakes and powder drinks but what I had worked for me so I left them. I hated drinking all the time too and then I found I could easily take popsicles and that gave me fluid and a bit of sugar. I stuck with lemonade but fruit juice might be tasty too. I did still have to drink and I found rather than drinking just out of glass, a drinking straw actually made me drink more. Just the way my mind worked I guess but it helped me get enough fluid in. Long post but hope it helps in some ways. Moira",

For me, personally, i don't mind journey. I thought of myself being on my life's journey before bc. It works for me. My journey involved my early life, my loving husband, the birth of my beautiful daughters, plus the heaps of other ups and downs it had. Then came bc, a really hilly bit to journey over and even it has it ups and downs and beautiful moments. This is my life, I don't know what  is ahead but right from the beginning of my whole journey the end destination is death. When,how and in what state I will be in has never been in my control. It will be what it will be. I don't think of anything being stolen from me, I never had it in the first place.It is only ever potential. That is how I chose to remain in exactly what I do have which is today. I chose to generate as much as possible any joy and happiness as  I can dredge to the surface. And believe me I am no Pollyanna. It sucks donkey balls but I am also greatly blessed, it seriously could be worse and I am daily grateful for what I do have. But the whole fighting/survivor thing gets me. At 6 years stage 4 can I be called a survivor. I consider each day one of survival for anyone, how can it be applying to only one small group. And what indeed have they survived.  Still won't survive life girls and boys, it gets us all so keep looking over your shoulder. Fighting to me is redundant in physically terms. Damn cancer does what it likes and takes me along for the ride. Treatments work or it doesn't. Again not a lot to do with me. Eat healthly, exercise gently, do alternatives, yes they are part of my wellness package but my body is in control and I ride along with it. My fight is mental and emotional. I can work hard to stay in the moment, to live blowing raspberries at cancer and seizing the day. To inhale the beauty of sea, sky and nature and be glad I live where I am and with the people I do. When my mood drops and bad results come in and i face the harsh reality of what is most likely staring at me. I work hard to remember it is not now, it might be one day sooner than I would like but what if it isn't. Minds play mean and horrible tricks of taking us to our nightmares. It's all a mind game. Thoughts are not real they are projections of possibilities.  That is my fight and it 's hard fought and sometimes I lose and cry and scream and it's not stinking fair. But such is life, it isn't designed to be fair. We don't always \"win\". And if my dh mentions in any sentence, death notice or church sermon Fighting, fought or warrior. I will find some way to come back and make him really sorry he didn't listen to me more closely. This is my long and personal view.  Moira",

Even aggressive tumours can respond to treatment. I do agree that right now you might need some extra help in the form of anti-anxiety or anti-depressants. This is a huge blow to cope with and there is nothing wrong with getting something to help ease that. Talking to a councillor might help too. The thoughts go around in your head until you can't even think anymore. Talking to someone who deals with this professionally can help to sort out the tangle and maybe clear some of the mess rolling around in your brain. When I was first dx I felt like there was someone screaming in my head all the time and it wouldn't stop. It was worse knowing it was me screaming silently in pain.

I am one of those that the CT, MRI, Bone scan didn't show up the spot that was concerning as a met. All my scans were read by a number of docs, trying to get a definite answer. In fact, the bone scan showed a very clear picture of the vertebrae but the doc said it wasn't showing up enough as what they call a \"hot spot\" and they were pretty sure it wasn't cancer. I was so very happy that day. But in order to be sure he ordered a bone biopsy. That took a couple of weeks to do and get the results back. It was cancer from that so yes sometimes it takes that much but there is sort of list of tests they  use and most of the time they get the answers without having to run though the whole lot. It does take time and there is noting worse that expecting to get real answers and coming away with more questions. It just sucks but it is the way it is. Hold onto the fact that it is only those three small spots that are even concerning them. And even the fact that they can't tell from the other scans. It's NOT obvious so to me that would mean it is not big n nasty but small and quite likely not cancer. Hope you get the biopsy soon. It's quite easy to do but you need to make sure she gets good relaxants and anesthetic around the site. Can be achy a couple of days at the very most but nothing major. So sorry it is taking so long but look on it as a positive. Cancer is a sneaky beast but your out hunting and it won't get away. Moira",

Physio did help but I had a physio who had treated my back for years. I worked in early childhood and all the lifting and twisting was hard on my back after 20 years. So I had a lot of trust in her and she used exercises, similar to yoga to help ease my spine/vertebrae, nerves all back in line. For me that fixed me in the time before cancer. After my dx cancer was found in one of my bottom vertebrae but it wasn't painful and never has been. Go figure!! When the mets came in my hip in 2010, pain and more pain developing over about three months. I had rads and then I was sent to a pain specialist, not my GP and not my onc, they are not the people who know this stuff best. A bit worryingly the pain specialist is often based with hospice. Can be a bit freaky, but it is not hospice they just run alongside each other. So when you say you are taking strong pain meds, who prescribed them and what are they?  I ended up with three different types of pain meds. One for bones, one for nerves and one for muscles and general things. Then I was closely supported as too how I was doing and if they needed to increase levels, which they did a couple of times. When the pain was under control  they kept in touch to make sure I was ok. About 6ish months later I started reducing the amount I was taking and in the end I didn't need any of them. Like Chrissy said you do need more than an exray, in fact for my back I have never had an exray. I've had CT, MRI, bone scan and bone biopsy. It took all of those to finally get a definite dx of cancer cells. Before that they were sitting on the fence and unsure as each scan might have been or maybe not. Bone scan said No it wasn't cancer. Just to be sure they did a bone biopsy and guess what...... cancer cells!. So I know the benefit of being totally thorough  and am thankful to my onc for not stopping at the bone scan. Even if it is nerves in your vertebrae or your discs there should be some pain relief you can get while you explore if physio might be helpful. With the hormonals, which I have been on Tamox and femara, I didn't get joint pain but many women who do say they find gentle stretching and exercise actually reduces pain. Sounds wrong doesn't it. Swimming or aqua jogging is really good too. I do that when I'm not doing chemo. Sorry for the long post but I have been there, done that, so thought some ideas of what has worked for others might help. If you are in pain, don't take no for an answer and a doc's shrug is not ok either. There are many options but you have to find the right people who know their stuff and can prescribe and monitor you properly. I'm in New Zealand so some of my labelling of people might be different where you are but close enough I think. Push and keep pushing until you get what you need. Pain is not acceptable  unless every avenue has been exhausted. Moira.",

Did 13 weeks of weekly Taxol and blood tests of liver functions showed numbers dropping until nearly back in normal range. CT  in Nov showed new and larger mets so Taxol a bust for me. I had no symptoms either. Onc put me on FEC since I didn't have it as I was stage 4 from get go. Had two cycles and blood tests show more improvement in one liver function and worse in another. So onc says those tests obviously not helping to tell if FEC working yet. Next week I will do TMs as they usually are a good trend marker for me. My new onc doesn't do them as regularly as my old one so I don't have too many recent ones. But in Aug they were 2500, which is ridiculously high.  So I'm in waiting mode both for the TMs and then scans if TMs are bad. Jan is either going to be a relief or a sucky month. I'm working really hard on staying in the moment and not looking too far forward or dreading the worst. So I hope both of us get that chemo that works. I do know there are still a few more to try if FEC doesn't but yeh I want this one to work for a while at least.   Moira",

I know I didn't have any problems afterwards though and had no need of extra help or any more time off work. A bit of tenderness around the spot was about all. The waiting to have it done and for the results are the hardest bit.  Can't help with the time for results as that is dependent on where you are getting it done.

Many people have cysts, marks or lines on their liver that are just there and do nothing. If it is a problem it will show itself in time. Hard as it is, waiting the three months is the best option. If you get any other symptoms then you can go back to your doc and ask for the scan to be brought forward. Worse case scenario and it ends up being mets there are many treatments.

Modern science can do lots of wonderful things but somethings are too small to show more than a \"maybe\". Waiting the 3 or so months will tell them if they grow anymore or disappear or remain the same. Getting anything sooner might only produce the same results. Worst case and in 3 months they do show up as something nasty the delay will not have effected the outcome. Treatment will be the same and will work the same. Lymp nodes can swell for other reasons and hard as it is a \"wait and see\" attitude is not wrong. Maybe someone might have a different idea but I don't think right now there is another test that would show anything. Horrible as the waiting for the time to pass is, you must remember it very well might not be mets. treat it as a \"pass\" and unless you develop anything that concerns you get on with enjoying the next three months.

So took a bit of finding. Had one met in my lower spine. BUT I had node involvement of 9 out of the 13 they took so you can see that it was much more likely that at some point they would find something. I had no pain for that met but some people do. A couple of years later when I got mets in my right hip, yes they hurt, a constant dragging pain. But they also found them in my left hip at the same time and no pain in that hip, go figure. I think, with my very limited knowledge, that with your dx it is pretty unlikely what you describe would be mets but scans would be the most conculsive way of finding them. Xrays are a good place to start so doc isn't wrong.  Anxiety is very normal at this time and as things settle down you will relax. One of the other things docs say is if the pain is still there or increasing after 3 weeks then look at it. Gives normal aches and pains a chance to settle and we can stop holding our breaths. Elbows are generally not a place mets go but ribs can be, usually would still hurt whether you touched them or not. Hope this helps, sort of rambling but that is what I have found with mine. Getting reassureance can help you know what is \"normal\" or not, so if nothing else helps push for the scans even if it is just once so you can see that everything is clear. All the best. Moira",

Even if those spots do turn out to be mets you can do lots of things to treat them. I also had two areas on my liver that showed on scans. They were not cancer and have never changed. From the scan they could have been cancer but many people have marks on their liver that show up. Just to let you know that things can be other that what we first think.

Mine started in my knee, with an ache that I thought was from the treadmill at the gym. I have had back pain before and my  original mets was to my L3. I didn't think this was mets but I didn't have any pain from my back mets either so I had nothing to judge it by..  We were going to Europe in Oct and this was Sept. On my visit to onc before I went he asked about why I was limping. Told him my knee hurt from the gym. We agreed between us that I would have it looked at when I got back. My TMs were rising so I think he knew there was a chance it was mets. The pain gradually left my knee and headed into my hip and over the month in Europe it got worse and I had to take painkillers most days in order to do all the walking up and down stairs. Europe has a lot of stairs by the way. Everything is either upstairs or in the basement of places. I did a lot of stretching and trying to move my hip joint as I had had back problems and sciatica for a long time. It didn't help and when I got back and they did a scan I had a tumour in my illiac joint. My pain if I can remember was constant and deep and didn't go away with normal painkillers. In an aside the interesting thing was that as I was having rads to the right hip I slipped off the rads table and landed badly on my left hip trying to protect my right. Immediate pain and trouble walking and two days later they did another scan and found 3 small spots in my left hip. No pain at all and who knows how long that might have taken to show up. The general rule is if pain has not changed or disappeared in 3-4 weeks and there is no clear reason for it then it is a good idea to get it checked out. Maybe if you have a physio you use you could get it looked at there first and see if they can improve things. If it's tumours that will make no difference but it might solve your problem if it's muscular. All the best with this. In the end you have to decide for yourself if the worry is worth waiting or you are better off knowing what is and isn't going on. Moira",

When you think you have a sort of understanding on it all, up pops something else. From my experience and what I have read here about others, your onc treatment is standard. Rads to kill the cancer on the spot and reduce pain and hormonals to continue treatment. They are considered the gentler option and do work very effectively. They tend to be a bit slower at reducing tumours but just as effective. Chemo is so much harsher and many onc keep them for when the hormonals stop working or if you have a huge jump in activity and they want a quick shut down of the tumours. Mine did that a couple of years ago when megace stopped working and I had more mets in spine, ribs and hips. Tiny ones but there. Did 6 cycles of xeloda,had complete response and went onto femara, which has continued to work for over a year now. Once a chemo has been used it often can not be re-used so onc keep them for later when hormonals have done all they can. That is a bit of a simplistic explanation but the general gist of it. Your mum plan is/was very similar to mine and it does work. Still, hoping for you guys that you don't need it. How long to they think you will have to wait for this result? Moira",

Lying there and leting them poke and prod me to get the exact position and the the tattoos. Tiny dots on the skin. the rads themselves are over very quickly and the effects carried on for sometime after the treatments are done. So don't worry if there is still some pain at the end of the 5 times. My rads were called \"spot welding\" by the team.Thought that was funny way to put it but it sort of fit. Aredia was fine for me too. Had 18 months of it and have now stopped but can go back on it if my bone densisty drops. It was my opportunity to sit and read a book in peace and quiet once a month. She and you will feel much better now that you can move forward and know you are doing something to deal with the little Bu**ers.  I have had 5 years of this and doing great so I'm sure your mum will be actually doing better once she gets rid of the pain and the lumps.

Maybe a little pregnancy guilt to encourage her to keep you happy. She will not want to upset you or do anything that will spoil the pleasure of the coming baby. Congrats on that joyful event too. I am careful here to say I'm no doctor and this is not gospel but generally pain from bone mets does not come and go. Mine started like a pulled muscle and then over a couple of months increased to a very deep pain in my right hip. Didn't ever come and go. Pain meds helped but they were just over the counter ones and bone mets need something much stronger usually. Still the pain was always there. That is the usual pattern for bone mets but with cancer it's a tricky beast and throws curve balls sometimes. Still the fact it is not constant and steadily getting worse is hopeful I think. All the best for the visit this week. More best wishes for the new baby. Moira",

Hadn't had any pain before the fall. Don't think there had been anything there in the bone scan 2 months earlier for the right hip. Mets have to be a certain size before they show up so maybe they were just big enough to see by then. Usual advice is to get any thing that has not cleared up or improved in 2-3 week checked out. One of the hardest things I have found with this is that  for every time one symptom is true for someone, it is not true for others. If only BC would behave in a certain way it would be much easier to know what was going on. If in doubt, check it out. Using the 3 week wait check so you are not at the docs all the time!! Moira",

Stormynyte is right I think. You are asking very caring questions and it is obvious how much you want to help. The thing is your parents have a long established relationship and it works for them. How far do you go in pushing into that relationship \"for their own good\". Truly I don't know. You want to help and as a by stander you can see how things could work better but is it right to do? I have no answer to that but feel you need to consider their wishes and way of interacting together too. Your pop being at the appt may help.You might be able to slide questions in that you think he should hear the answers to.  Treatments are different for those in their older years. My mum was 81 when dx. It made me cry to think she would have to go through what I had gone. She had a mx and since she was stage 1 they decided no hormonal either. No rads either. We are in NZ and they believe in quality of life rather than quantity of life here so they are less aggressive in treating,and doing things they think will do little to prolong life and be too hard for older bodies to cope with. My mum is 86 now and doing fine with no recurrnace.  You have to weight up those two things very much when dealing with someone who is already in their 80s.Plus your mum wishes for treatment. What you want for her and what she wants for herself. I don't think there is any easy answer and these questions wil come up time and again as you all try to work your way through this. My mum is no hugger either but I just rang her and kept in touch(we didn't live nearby) If she wants to talk let her but she may be private about what she tells you. Plus if you push too hard will she stop telling you anything? She is an adult and can make those decisions  for herself even if you don't agree. This is tough and I can see how this could be very painful for the whole family. One thing to remember. This is her journey not yours. You have to respect that. Please come again and ask questions and air concerns. It is obvious you want the very best for your mum. Moira",

I did 8 cycles, 3 weeks on 1 week off. Some do 7 on 7 off, depends on onc. 8 cycles took me to NED, so great for me. I found it pretty ok to do. Did get some hand and foot problems but make sure you use a really good skin moisturiser and keep on top of it.  It is so individual that it is hard to know what anyone will experience. Watch for diarrhea and fatigue. They can be common. Didn't happen to me but there is a xeloda thread where ladies mention it. Check that out too for helpful advice. Each response is different so how long it might work is totally unknown. Just have to hop on the boat and ride the rapids. Follow the instructions careful for xeloda. Half hour after food and 12 hours apart.Seems to help doing it right. Hopefully someone might have been on your combo and can comment but thought I would let you know about xeloda. Moira",

You are just working though the fact that something damn scary has just happened to you and you don't know if it's all gone. Something that truthfully no-one can tell you 100%. Life will throw curveballs when you lest expect them. It's not a trivial matter and I don't mean that you shouldn't worry but try to remember you are fine today and living today, that in the total essence of life is all any of us have. Just takes some getting our head around when we have been happily wondering our way through life and then cancer or something else slaps us in the face with a wet fish and wakes us up to the reality of life. Give yourself some time and if need be get some help with working it through and then get on with the business of living a great life. That is the best revenge for cancer. Moira",

Would have been stage 3 and treated as such if my onc hadn't decided that he wanted a bone biopsy done as well as the bone scan(that said not cancer). I was even more unusual because other than the lump in breast I had no symptoms. Still don't really show anything except in Tms rising. So I'm called asymptomatic as well as unusual. There are quite a few \"get go stage 4\" on this board but it is a big group covering many parts of the world. I'm just glad we have it because before the internet it would have been terrible and the feelings of isolation would have been so much worse. I have heard of cancer groups not feeling that stage 4 can met with other stages, we scare them I think. How do they think we feel being called the bogeyman of cancer or woman in our case. I was really fortunate that I had a group that did cover all stages of breast cancer, some were a few years out of early stage but they still needed that support too. We didn't really linger on stages but talked about all aspects of how cancer affected our lives. Only met for 6 months but it was fine while it lasted. I'm with coolbreeze and the others. Even a letter to the organizers pointing out how being excluded made you feel. It's not catching you know and some of those women might one day be in your position. Having some knowledge that it is not yet the end of the world might help. By the way, I'm nearly 5 years out and still doing well.

Nerves etc can take a while to heal and sometimes you can get shooting pains from nerves firing randomly. Just the joys of the journey. Talk to your docs about it but it sounds connected to muscles rather than bone. It is really hard not to question everything your body does from now on but hopefully things settle down and you start recognising \"normal\" body reactions. I was also reading your question on TMs and was going to ask which test you onc uses. There is CA  27-29 and CA 15-3. They do the same thing but numbers range differently depending on which one is used. Your number sounds low to me and it also depends on what your numbers have been before. If this is your first time then you have no pattern to follow. TMs can be totally useless for some people and show patterns for others. But a single or even couple of tests are not sufficient to provide enough data. It is when they show a consistent rising or doubling pattern that oncs start to look for scans to see if things are changing. Rising or falling a few points is not enough to be too concerned about. It needs to be big jumps, other things including chemo can have an affect on them so many oncs don't even use them as they can be too scary and unreliable for patients. They are generally used more for when you already have mets cos they can show respond to treatment. Again they are often unreliable even then. Stupid things, but it is all part of the tricky nature of cancer. It's natural to have many questions and sometimes it is after the first round of treatments are finishing that you start to think about what if. You need to learn to \"read\" your body again and look forward without fear. That is tricky for many people and sort of hard to come to terms with when you are coming out the other side. Give your self time to settle down and heal body and mind. And be kind to yourself, no one has all the answers. Moira ",

It can give you lots of info that you may not even think to ask your onc. There is no cure once you are stage 4 but there are many treatments that can manage the cancer for long periods of time. You haven't given your mum's status and grade of cancer, but I'm guessing from the fact that she was on tamox and then femara that she is ER+ and Her2-. Otherwise I think she would have had hercepten as well. It is likely that the tamox and femara successfully held the cancer at bay or stopped it coming back for those 11 years. There are still other hormonals that work very well and many chemos that can knock the cancer back and then return to hormonals again.  So, it depends on what the what your mum's onc recommends for her treatment plan. I had stage4 from the get go with single bone met. That was 5 years ago yesterday and I'm living a normal life doing everything I did before. Have had ups and downs and a couple of changes in treatment but that is to be expected. When I was first diagnosed I had bone mets and I have had more in my hips a few years ago. I was given radiation to the area, this help with pain management and fried the little bu**ers, which felt good.  All the time I have felt fine and in the beginning my bone met in my spine never hurt at all. Only the ones in my hip did. I have had few side effects from the hormonals and even xeloda which is a chemo taken as a pill was fine. Some people have more reaction but your mum has already had tamox and femara so she is obviously use to them. Take a big deep breath and remember that this is a hard time until she gets onto her new treatment plan and things settle down. It does sound quite positive in that her general health is good and those pesky mets have not really given her a major problem yet. That pain was a good reason to find these now and get onto killing them stone dead, that's the way I like to see my pills working for me. You will get lots of good advise here and women who are so supportive and encouraging for both you and your mum. They are just awesome and so helpful. I agree with Racy, you can get copy of the report but remember that it does need to be read with a medical slant. But it does help to remind you about status of receptors etc. The lung nodule may or may not be cancer remember. It can be other things or just a funny reading of the scan. This is very doable for your mum and she has been doing this for 11 years. This is just a bump in the road as my breast care nurse use to tell me. Felt like a brick wall at the time but is does retreat to the bump in the road after a while. All the very best and do come back if and when you need to. Moira",

Why can't onc just be straight forward and do the things we expect them to. So if I understand it right, they biopsied the other side from the big lump because nothing was found there. That is good news but if it was bone it might not show up in either CT scan or ultrasound. That is possible, and you need the bone biopsy to confirm no cancer cells. Still good news that it is looking more likely that it is not mets there. The onc may have some suspicions about the lymph that he wants a definite answer for and depending on that he may order more tests. What a long drawn out process this has been for you all. It is very tiring to build up to these tests and the still not get any answers. It's very hard on the nerves. So, it is still wait and see what the next visit tells you. I think it might be very useful to write down the questions you have and take them along. Then make sure you ask them all and get clear answers from the onc. Write the answers down so you can process them later. It is surprising how much we miss hearing and remembering. Or each person there hears it differently.Don't let the onc rush you and be happy with the fullness of his answers before moving on to the next one. Sometimes we feel like we have stupid and trivial questions and don't bother him with them but they are usually the ones that bug us the most. If your mum English is not good then even recording the meeting and being able to replay later might help her understand at her own pace. I know many women here record their meetings. Quicker and easier than making notes i think. Still in many ways it seems positive for a good result. Still playing the waiting game though. Moira",

I got 6 months break with markers down and then rising and when they did I went onto femara which has been working for over a year now. So I consider it gave me 6 months time with nothing being put into my body and I was ok. My markers are a good indicator for me and I had them tested monthly during that time so I was closely watched and my onc could respond when he saw the rise. hope that is useful in letting you know that it is possible to take a break and be ok. Scary to do but it is good that she can take a break and let her body heal if she has had any SEs. Xeloda can be restarted if need be and still be effective. Moira",

In the beginning I cried cos if my lost future and then through counselling and my own beliefs I decided that I never had that \"promised\" future. The reality is that we only have today, who knows what my future might have had in different circumstances. There arn't any other realities, just the one we are living. I thought I would just get sicker and sicker and die. I could have lived with that predication and lived my life accordingly but I decided cancer wasn't taking my present from me.

I can live with cancer taking any pleasure and happiness out of the day or I can look around and believe that I have many blessings in my life and I am damn well going to enjoy them while I can. Cancer will not pollute and steal my today and I can't even beginning to predict what the future holds. As it is, I'm still doing very well, I've had progression but it has been beaten back a couple of times and right now I'm doing Taxol for liver mets. Hoping it working but who knows. I don't, but today is lovely and sunny, I'm not working today and I'm getting out and about. I'm no Pollyanna, this disease devastates me, but if there is any truth is the survivor/fighter talk it is in how we fight to live rather than allowing cancer to steal our lives long before we actually die. That is the true battle. I hate cancer, I rage at it and I refuse to let it steal my present, screw it, it's my life today and I'm fighting to live rather than waiting to die. Sorry this is so long but it is something I've been aware of as I come up on the 6 year mark. Moira",

When I was diagnosed it was in one vertebrae on my spine. That was shown on the first CT scan. BUT, the docs said it looked suspicious for mets but not conclusive, it could have been other things as I had back problems before, so I was sent for an MRI, which shows a different way of seeing the bone and fluid etc around it. I'm not an expert on how they work or why doc order them I just know they do. The MRI again showed something but it was still not that clear to be definitely ruled as mets. So this time a bone scan, that showed what they call a \"hot spot\" again BUT they thought it was not cancer from the scan. Finally my onc sent me for a bone biopsy which did indeed find cancer cells. It was mets in the final run. So, you can see that one CT scan is not a definite test for mets. It is possible for breast cancer to come back even after all those years but it is also possible to get another different cancer.Your mum's onc does need to find out what is actually in those spots and a bone biopsy would be the only way to do that I think. Don't quote me on that, I'm no doctor but they can't tell from outside the bone what sort of cancer it is. Maybe on Thur your onc will discuss having the other scans done to check. Other wise ask, it is very normal to get a couple of tests done each time. Even now after 5 years I still get a CT scan and a Bone scan each time. They run in tandem for bone mets. One will show somethings and one will show others. Sometimes my CT scan will show stuff that actually should show up on the bone scan but isn't and then the other way around. I have no idea why. This whole journey is loopy at times and I just listen to what the whole result is.  Good luck with your appt but I certainly would be pushing hard for more concrete info and a biopsy to be sure.

No one can tell you what is causing the pain exactly but have you spoken to your doc?  My experience with bone mets it that they hurt all the time and don't go away. You say it feels like muscular pain and it is possible you are pulling a muscle at certain times and this is resulting in the pain coming and going. Have you tried an anti flam on it to see if that eases it when it is hurting. Sometimes a hot pack to see if that helps. If that provides relief then it is unlikely to be mets. Bone mets can feel like a very deep aching pain, not so much sharp and biting. But, everyone is different and so it is hard to tell. If in doubt, check it out. Plus you will be able to relax maybe a little. Try the usual things to help a pulled muscle and if it all continues see your doc. It is absolutely ok to freak out and worry about every pain but there are all the other usual culprits that caused pain before bc to consider too.  Hope it goes away or you get some relief. Moira",

If you haven't already get some anti-anxiety meds to help take the edge off.   There is no point in being stoic or tough, get help and a little med to calm the mind is no bad thing.

No-one knows the why. If you take this to it end you could say Why were you born? Why do you look like you do? It is just part of life and living. From your other posts you are in a very hard place right now and that is what you need to try and focus on.  You will drive yourself into an even worse place if you don't get help and turn this around. It is not unusual to question the whole why thing but it is leaving you in a very bad place and I can tell how unhappy you are. Please look to see what there is near you in terms of counselling or get some anti-depressants to help. I think you said in one post that they made you dizzy but there are others to try that may not have that side effect. Do you have a church pastor you can talk to or can they help finding someone you can talk to. Even if you have tried this and it hasn't worked don't give up, try and find another one. When you feel as bad as you seem to be right now it is hard to find the energy to reach out one on one but you need to. If you can't, is there a family member who can be the one to make contact or find help and be there to support you. Being brutal and I apologise in advance if this unwelcome but you sound seriously depressed and you may not be able to get out of this without professional help. There is nothing wrong with saying that and making those on your medical team help support you. This is a terrible place to be and you don't deserve to be left to deal with it all yourself. I truly hope things get better for you and you find some joy in life again. Moira",

It's so hard for children but they do understand that they wouldn't want the dog to suffer and be in pain and they can remember all the great times they had with them. My children have often surprised me with their ability to accept that better that I can. Saying goodbye is very important and knowing that their pet had such fun in that last afternoon will be a happy memory. And in a while they can think that there are many animals that need loving homes and how wonderful it would be to give an unwanted dog a great home. Children get that really well too. Moira",

A bully is simply that a bully, no matter the age and the way they do it. Only way to fight is to stand up and call them on it. Nice people have a problem doing that cos they don't like getting mean to other people but that is the only rules the bully understands. Most places have one and sometimes they are the boss,work places like that are hell. Getting out can be the only way to save yourself. Dbla obviously found that and she is right. She doesn't need that in her life but it means she has lost something she loves and that school has lost another good teacher. She won't be the only one leaving. Just a toxic place to work. Congrats on standing up and doing something proactive and still professional to take back control. Not easy to do but I bet that principal is p*ssed when he has to deal with it all.

Take me or leave me, this is who I am. I have a tattoo up my forearm that reads, \"Whilst we live, let us live\" Up either side I am putting the number of years I have lived with this. Nearly ready for number 7. The point for me is the living and in that I put laughing as well. Moira",

Then onto tamoxifen which held me NED for 2 1/2 years. Then progression in 2010 in both hips and onto xeloda for 8 cycles. Again NED at the end. I had some peeling of my hands and feet.  Tiny amount and in no way interfered with doing anything. A really good hand and foot cream helped enormously with healing. So it can be done like than without the Ixempra and be very effective. But like the others have said MD Anderson is one of the best. Maybe ask why they feel it is necessary. Or you could start out with one only and see if you get good results. Really hope it all works out for you. Moira PS In Nov it will be 6 years since my dx and I have lived a full and a new normal life. I was 45 at the time and thought my life was over. Totally not true but only by living day by day can that be learnt. It's not easy but it is doable to look forward and not let cancer dictate every area of your life.",

They were great and very quickly got me on a good blend of meds that got the pain completely under control. They rang weekly to check with me and when I wanted to decrease dosage and come off they helped with that. That was 3 years ago and I would not hesitate to use them again.But it is funny how we associate \"palliative\" with \"terminal\" cos it is but in actual terms they do different things. But it does take a bit to move pass the word and know it is not any way an indication of getting closer to the end. Really hope they have something amazing to get the nausea under control. Moira",

I had a regular person who contacted me quickly, dealt with me and how my pain was effecting me and prescribed better pain meds than my onc. She kept in contact with me by phone every week until I was pain free and after rads and more treatment my mets were dealt with. Then she put me on what they call List B, which means I was no longer in need of their immediate care but was on their radar should I need them again. Katbob has a very good point, at this time you are in control and the pressure is not so great. You can get to know them in a slightly more relaxed time and not under pressure when you are seriously not well. They are just part of your on-going treatment plan and you will have time to consider each step. They may have some of the answers to those questions that are stopping you sleeping.

Haven't had scans since last nov which was when they knew the spots were coming back. Femara and xeloda both work for me and at the moment femara is bringing things down slowly but surely. I know that I can return to xeloda at a later date and the longer between then and the next time will mean a better response. Each treatment has a certain life and I want to keep xeloda as a good backup with the likelihood of a good response for the future. I think if you talk to your onc he might agree to another cycle of  xeloda before going onto femara. And they usually do monitor closely to make sure things are working. It's a tough decision when you know what you are currently on is doing the job to trust that something untried will work. A leap of faith I suppose. Moira",

I had a great response to Xeloda and in May I was NED and had TMs CA 15-3 of 27. Stopped Xeloda. After a couple of months the TMs started rising again and in Dec I had CA15-3 of 400. So onto femara, it has only been just over a month and today my TMs were 900. My onc is suggesting I stay on femara for another month and we will check again. My question is - Have others had a delay before TMs come down?  I feel absolutely fantastic and have no SEs yet!!  My onc suggests scans next month if markers are still up, just to see if anything shows up.  If Femara doesn't work I have one more hormonal before my onc wants to go to chemo. I know I have been very lucky with my treatments and after 4 years I am still very healthy and happy but I am a bit down that maybe Femara which should be such a great treatment for me might not work. Hate visiting my onc and waiting for him to tell me what my own body is doing. Excuse me I'm just whining and need to get over myself. Thanks for taking the time to read.

This would be very helpful to have as a sticky thread as it has such a huge amount of info on nausea all in one place. Plus the palliative care info. Many women are hesitant to use a pall doc cos they think their med onc does everything and quite frankly they don't do pain meds very well. And with nausea we sometimes think we have to cope with it as just an Se and our doc has given us something so that must be all there is. Hope you have a good visit with the pall people Karen Moira",

You and your mum have certainly had a hard time of it but here are a number of women whose cancer has been found in similar circumstances. There are things that can be done to help your mum. I know someone will come along who has had the compression fractures and can be more informative than I. Just hold on and they will be along soon. I'm thinking your mum must have been checked for mets elsewhere and if they are still only in her bones she has a reasonable chance of living many years yet. Being in as much pain as she is will make that seem unlikely but the pain can be better dealt with.(I've had bones mets for nearly 5 years and even with a couple of bumps on the road am still doing really well). Palliative care is not hospice. My hospice, and I live in New Zealand, deal with pain management the best, not my onc. When I had pain from hip mets and he wanted me to see them I panicked and thought it was the end. Not so at all. Pain was better managed until I had rads and that removed all pain. I was using two walking sticks to get around then and within a month I was walking again normally. I was 47 so found it hard to be like that but it was resolved I am on Femara too and it helping. The aredia will help her bones so it seems that they are giving her fairly standard treatment. But, pain is not ok and you need to push to have it bought under control. I know there are things that can be done for the compression, especially in the states. I have read about that on this site. Maybe if you search the site help you will find posts about it. You are doing great things for your mum and please know that there is still lots that can help. I wonder at not having herceptin but as I am HER2- I don't know too much about that. Others will be on their way soon to answer better that I can. This site is wonderful on many levels, not just for info but for friendship and an understanding of what everyone affected by this dratted illness goes though. Lots of humour pages too and they are so helpful to remember the lighter side of life. Sorry, for going on but I did want you to know that someone had heard and is willing to reach out and say Hi.  Moira ",

I had scans done July and Oct and they were fine so hoping that continues. My onc scans quite a bit as I show few if any symptoms and my markers are a good general indicator that something is happening. i think I just need to relax and stop panicking that things are not changing fast enough. I'm often like this after a visit to my onc no matter what he says. I have had him for 4 years from the initial dx and yesterday was the first time he told me how well I'm doing and that I'm amazing in the way I have coped. Usually he is quite blunt and non committal. So that was nice to get some positives from him.  He must have had a wonderful relaxing Christmas. He is very hard-working and caring but not at all touchy feeling sort of man. So thanks for helping me get some perspective on this. This site and the beautiful women and men on it make such a difference in so many ways. Moira",

But we are all living right now and what I take from so many of those women who I miss so much, is their determination to LIVE. No one knows how short or long any life will be but those women knew that they needed to live fully. By their example, so do I. By their strength I find strength. Then I pay it forward. If not then what does happen to those new women(the ones    we were once).  When we did the count of stage 4 women, I noticed how many were lurkers, good on them, but if they had nothing to read and no one to offer the support they silently needed, what a terrible thing it would be.
