They took off the steristrips but the internal sutures are sticking out the ends. They said they will just fall off in 45 days but I'm wondering why they left the sutures sticking out of the incision? Won't that affect how it will heal? When I had a C-section, everything was inside and I could even feel the little knot at the end. I'm worried this incision will not heal in a straight line. Additionally, approximately 9 days after the surgery, I have begun having pain under my breast close to my abdominal muscle. When I raise my arm up, I can see something under the skin pulling from the incision to the ab muscle and it is very tender. My ab muscle on that side is also swollen. Is this normal? I called and they said to put warm compresses on it and didn't seem too worried because it's not red or anything but it is definitely very tender and I find it odd that it didn't hurt when I originally had the surgery and is only hurting now? What could it be? I almost looks as if a \"ligament or tendon\" is attached to my muscle and is being pulled too tight or something. I can't raise my arm up too high above my head or stretch without it hurting. Am I being too active too soon??  ",
