I had a suspicious mammo, (results received a could weeks after mammo) then wait for ultrasound and spot mag. Mine was also Birads 4, microcalcifications. I had never heard of them!! I knew I had fibrocystic breasts, but that was all. Saw a Dr I didn't care for, he wanted biopsy. He was rude and didn't seem to care one iota what I was going through. So I decided to make an appt at a breast clinic and wait 3 more weeks. I decided if someone was going to cut on me, it would not be him. Part of my anger was just because of the whole thing, but I wanted to be in better hands. Finally went for my biopsy on July 31, and they found another lump in the opposite breast. So I had to get two biopsies that day (one core biopsy on lump and one stereotactic on the calcifications since they were deep and close to my chest wall). That was a Thursday, had to wait until Tuesday for my results....and thank God they were both benign. I do have to go back in 3 months. They couldn't tell me anything at all with the ultrasound - nothing until the pathology report came back where they actually checked the tissue. So it's normal you don't get any discussion about the ultrasound except whether or not to recommend a biopsy. Take care and keep posting :-)",

It's hard not to worry for those entire 3 months, but I have to try. I have fibrocystic changes in both breasts (both biopsied - one core, one stereotactic) and he said they want to keep an eye on the changes. I'm still trying to peel myself off the ceiling from the 6 week ordeal and waiting to get into the right Dr., plus getting off the nerve meds that helped me through. I don't want to have to take them all the time, so I'm trying hard to relax during this 3 months. Another alarming thing is I read mostly about people going back in 6 months, like you. But 3?? So I started second guessing....what are they not telling me?? etc. But I have to try to keep that kind of thinking quiet and get into other things. My worry won't change the outcome, that's for sure!",

It just didn't show. When I was there at the clinic and they gave me the bad news....that I would have double the pleasure....the one nurse showed me it was because this lump had blood flowing to it. And it all happened so fast I didn't get to ask what it looked like....what was the Birads number....nothing. I had a nerve pill in me and my mind was going in slow motion. My family dr had told me that cancer tended to pull blood flow awhile back about my other ultrasound and it wasn't pulling the bloodflow which he said was a good sign....- so now I'm really scared. Not only do I have the microcalcs on one side with associated density, but now this too!!

But before the biopsy, the nurse showed me the report and it just said something about bloodflow. Thank you for the thoughts and prayers. I'm pretty scared...staying on nerve pills as needed....attending lots of church services to be uplifted....and waiting.

I have taken my anti--anxiety meds but today they didn't do much good. I started the day by filling out the paperwork (they sent me ahead of time). I am sending them records from my hysterectomy. So of course I  had to read over them (from 7 years ago). I had a small place of carcinoma in situ if that is how you spell it.....cervical. They did a cone and it had clear margins, which could have meant that was it...done. BUT they scrapped up in me and it was not satisfactory (they didn't say cancer, but maybe inconclusive?). So I had a complete hysterectomy because of this. Thankfully there was no more cancer in me, but I was full of dysplasia. No radiation.....no treatment....they got it all and I went for paps every three months for awhile...then 6, then annual again. Finally felt I could relax over it all. So now with this \"suspicious density with associated calcifications\" I freaked while doing paperwork this morning. Most days lately I've been hanging onto the 80% benign thing....but this morning I guess I had to torture myself with the reports from hyster, plus these reports....plus looking at the films again myself with a flashlight behind them to see this microcalcs. Then I thought....well, if this is bc, does that mean Im doomed to have it keep cropping up other places in my body? I did take the hrt off two weeks ago. I had used it 7 years because my dr said \"OH go ahead and use it!!!\" He knew my family hx....mom had bc....sister uterine....but still told me it wasn't enough to bother me or whatever. I questioned him years ago about it with all the reports out. When they told me about the mammo results, I told them about the cervical and how freaked I was. The woman dr said \"that is not associated\". Oh, and that was to make me feel better? Nothing about ca makes one feel good. My sister had gone to a different dr after her hyster from uterine ca stage 1 (mine wasn't even a stage....it was very early and cervical). He immediately took her off hrt saying with her family hx, she had no business being on it. Duh.....I think we have the same family hx!!??  I should have listened to her and just took mine off then. My faith and hope and sensibility has gone out the window today. I guess on the downside of the roller coaster. Thanks for letting me vent. Love to you all. Log in to post a reply",

So there is a difference in what I would do now vs. what I would have done a year ago. A year ago before I knew things I would have just done what they say, come back in three months and not worried about it. Now, I would do different and I'll tell you why. I just want to share something that I had NO clue could happen: I don't know if you read that I'm waiting for results of 2 biopsys in my post. Back in June (friday the 13th the be exact) I went for an overdue annual mammo. I even joked with the girl, saying I shouldn't be here, it's friday the 13th. In a couple weeks, they called me back in for an ultrasound and spot magnification of the right breast. They found microcalcifications and associated density. Nothing wrong with left breast. So I go back. I told them I was surprised if anything it wasn't the left breast because I had this huge lump you could feel around 12 o'clock near front. They just did as they were told....right breast. Waited days and those results came back ultrasound ok.....Birads 2 (all benign findings - fibrocystic lumps). I was SO relieved. My 16 year old daughter, I will never forget the look on her face...and she ran, held me and we cried together. It had been scarey and a long long wait together. Two days later the spot mag came back saying the same about the calcs and density and they recommended biopsy. Birads 4. Here is the part you might be more interested in -- (sorry I get so windy, but this is a nervous weekend for me): I go to a surgeon to a bigger town than ours. Our equipment here isn't so great. So I think that's part of it - does your place have good equipment? Ours is trying to raise money for better equipment. So I see this surgeon and he wanted to ultrasound the left huge lump I had mentioned. He said it was fine - cyst. But I didn't feel comfortable or trusting with him. He didn't explain, only that he wanted to biopsy. I had no clue how! I was so nervous and he didn't give me time to calm and ask questions. I told him I was a wreck and he shrugged his shoulders. That did it. I opted to go to James Cancer Clinic up north, and the section I went to is breasts only. So in between him and waiting to get in the clinic, that cyst practically went away. Again, I was so thankful!! I could still feel a little bit of it. So this past Thursday I went. I thought these are specialists, all they do is breasts (people travel from all over to come to this place) and it was FULL of women. So I go in hopes that maybe they would say \"we'll just watch it, come back in three months\" and I could go on with life. But that the very worst would be they would want to biopsy that right breast. Wrong again!! The Dr felt that left breast (like the surgeon who ultrasounded it) and said I want my own pictures of both breasts. Ultrasounds. I didn't give it a thought....ok, ok, they will find the left it ok. It came out ok on mammo here, ok up north a little ways at surgeon, but they are being cautious.  Another long story - but bottom line, that fibrocyst huge thing on left had been hiding a lump that noone saw. And so instead of what I was hoping would be the worst (biopsy right breast today) turned into biopsy both breasts. I had no clue that a fibro could hide something!! They told me not to blame that surgeon, that these hide things sometimes. And they have the best of equipment there. They asked if I wanted to do both at once or come back. I opted to do both. It was a long day, two different biopsy procedures, and I'm wiped out. But by Tuesday I will know something. Being a clinic like they are, they all told me they liked to \"err on the side of caution\". They kept telling me to remember - 80% of all these come back benign. I asked \"even with micro calcs? even with the blood flow going to it? (which is the case with the left one) and they said yes. So that's my story for what it's worth. I certainly don't want to alarm you at all. We have enough of that with all we have to go through as women.  My fibro was hiding something that needed biopsied. But I've had them for years though, and when I lived in another town that had better equipment, the radiologist would say \"yep, sisters!!\" about my fibrocysts. And it would be let go. But their equipment was better than this stupid town Im in. It just shocked me that a mammo and ultrasound didn't show it. Nothing!! So that's why I share this....new to me. Of course, all this is new to me. I cut my caffeine and the cysts went down before I went to specialist. So that was good I guess. Take care hugs Therese ",

The best night I had was last night. I've been eating finally and gained back almost 2 lbs of the 6 or so I lost from not being able to eat. I went to work this week...and then class last night (Law). The instructor was so interesting telling about cases that my mind relaxed and got into something else totally. Mornings are usually pretty hard for me. Last night I didn't take a nerve pill - I don't take them if I don't need them. So with only waking once and praying myself back to sleep, I was ok. But this morning Im shaking (waiting for nerve pill to take effect). So I get out the films (I have my envelope of films, reports, disc from ultrasound, etc) and take a look at the area of concern. I was trying to compare my Birads score of 4 to the pictures in the link Bessie gave us to the explanation of Birads. Mine seem to mostly be clustered tiny ones (more concern if they are micro, right?) within the nodular like density (which the ultrasound found all liquid filled cysts) but I have two questions: 1) In looking at the spot mag, how big is this in \"real life\". How much does this usually magnify the areas? 2) Could some of my liquid filled cysts have blocked this one to where it couldn't be seen on the ultrasound? They did a full breast ultrasound, I mean there isn't a place they didn't cover. If I asked any of these questions before I'm sorry to bother you again. I woke in a panic and thought about calling to see if they would put me on a cancellation list....but now I'm settling down a little and think I can wait it out. I have mixed feelings. First, I don't even want to have to be going through this (none of us do Im sure) but then again Im anxious to see an actual boob specialist. These people deal with nothing but this. One interesting thing.....I've cut my caffeine WAY down. I've slept more (even with night terror wake up calls) than I was before all this when I was pushing it so hard in the fast lane. The huge lump in the left breast that was sore (no concern, plus dr looked at it just to be sure the other day in his office with ultrasound) has reduced in a few days I would say to 1/4 the size. I've very tired which alarms me at times (I've heard if you have cancer you are tired) but trying to remind myself Im cutting caffeine.....I'm taking nerve pills.....and the stress of all this is tiring. Plus I noticed Im getting a little stronger from eating this week. And last night after class I felt stronger than I have in awhile.  I've also noticed my family can't win in my mind - if they are happy and joking about things I think \"don't you know what Im going through!!!\" and if they are down and worried acting I think \"can't you do something to cheer me up!!!\" Of course, I keep this all to myself because I know it's totally me and my state of mind.

He's so wrapped into his own mystery illness (dr sent him for bloodwork, ekg, etc etc) that he's had little time for me. Of course, with my mood it doesn't much matter. I did tell him though that if I have to have procedures done and he is still \"sick\" (he is somewhat of a hypochondriac who has never faced a scarey illness or disease in reality) that we would have to hire someone to care for us.  He also downplays my issues too, but you know, if he freaked I wouldn't be happy either lol. Im just not happy about the entire thing!",

I think that started my anxiety because I started worrying about how exhausted I was, forgetting that anxiety for 6 weeks before the procedure, then the horrid weekend wait for results, would wear out anyone. I'm still tired! Maybe partly depression too. I rested last night and this morning that isn't feeling like it was last night. I had also been using my right arm while tensed up to play a computer game (to get my mind focused). I also later realized when I touched my breast very very lightly in that area, I could feel that sensation up toward my shoulder. That convinced me it had to be a nerve or healing thing. They did poke a pretty big place, several times. When this place takes a biopsy (core and stereotactic) they get 6-8 pieces to be sure. And that breast had lots and lots of shots since it was a little more ouchy. I don't think its the fact it was stereotactic in itself, but because it was a deep place...near my chest wall.",

Can the titanium (I think that's what they are made of) chips they put in your breasts move? Today Im freaking a little (actually this evening). I was so horribly stressed during the long wait and now an old friend of mine is visiting - anxiety attacks. So my body has been pretty tensed up the past week. I have a history of doing this - having anxiety attacks after the fact (a life crisis, etc).  I think all the feelings I numbed with nerve pills are catching up so I'm tense in my body a lot. Anyway, I don't know if I'm just tensing those muscles or what. But I noticed a new pain going from the area where they did the stereotactic biopsy up to my shoulder (off and on). Actually, even when I touch the area, the \"pain\" (actually it isn't excruciating, just a little pain like feeling) goes from the area up to my shoulder upon touch. It feels muscular, as do the pains from tensing my back, ribs, etc feels, but this is a little strange. A new one. Could it be that the area is just taking it's time healing - maybe nerve endings? or muscle?...and this is little pains from healing, or does anyone know if these chips can move?? THAT is what is freaking me out! Thanks! Therese Log in to post a reply",

I went to a breast cancer clinic that is part of a large cancer center. I tried calling their 24/7 line, but the guy said there isn't anyone to answer questions except Mon-Fri 8-5. I am noticing other twinging pains as I relax. Actually, that's when I noticed it, when I finally relaxed in a hot tub tonite. And as I sit here and talk myself down and relax more, I'm noticing other pains not even close to the breast....just twinges. And just noticed one in the other breast. So I am thinking more possibly from remaining so tensed up. I'm hoping anyway! I will call them in the morning. I don't do real well with relaxation techniques because by the time I need them I'm so far gone I have to ride it out pretty much. Not fun, but something I've been burdened with all my life as a post-response to stressful times. It bothered me because I finally got myself relaxed in a hot tub. What I can do for stress when I get to feeling a little better is start walking again. That is the best stress relief and prevention that I've ever done. It just so happened when this came about I hadn't walked in a long long time and had gotten out of shape with FT work and school, both requiring me to sit on my bum in front of computer lots and lots of hours. I will say the stereotactic side has left a little more soreness than the core biopsy side.",

They ended up benign fibrocystic changes. Even with the calcifications. THANK God!! With family hx and since this was my first time there, they want me back in 3 months to check for changes in them.

I had seen a surgeon, didn't like or trust him. Didn't stick around for any questions....when I was obviously falling apart he shrugged his shoulders. I had a place with calcs and associated density on right breast, extreme posterior. I also had a huge cyst on the left, but the mammo didn't show anything wrong with it. This surgeon ultrasounded it (and I was mad, thinking he just wanted to make money lol) but also said cyst. I opted to go to a specialist up north at a breast clinic. That's all they do - boobs. Gobs of us sitting around in robes....very very professional, nice and encouraging workers there. THe surgeon was still \"a surgeon\" with a little attitude....but at least gave me time for questions....and tried to calm me down. He said he isn't into guessing by photos because he has guessed before and been wrong, both ways. Meaning he thought sure something was cancer....it wasn't on biopsy. Then he thought sure something wasn't cancer and on biopsy it was. So he won't guess. So this \"cyst\" that reduced in size (I had cut my caffeine because I didn't figure it helped my nerves....plus with huge fibrocystic breast, I thought it would be best. I had hoped the other suspicious place would leave too. Anyway.....the cyst reduced and revealed ANOTHER suspicious lump. Now since they just found it there, I had no report and have no clue of the Birads number. Didn't even think to ask about it. So they had set up the needle guided biopsy down a few rooms for the right breast (calcs) but wanted their own ultrasound first. AND he wanted to ultrasound the left just to be sure. I didn't think anything of the left. So here he is....outside my door and I heard him say \"this turned out worse than what we thought\". Oh GREAT....that isn't ME is it??? So he and his nurse walk in and say \"well, we had a little turn around here\". I am thinking \"OH....GOOD news?? Or maybe left instead of right??\" Nope....nada....wrong. BOTH breast need biopsy. He said he would \"try\" to work me in since they had so many biopsys. He was apologetic and said he would do his best, but he may have to impose and ask me to come back for the second biopsy. He asked if I was \"up\" for two biopsys. I thought \"Im not UP for ANY of this\" but said DO IT. I did ask if anyone else got 2 at the same time and he said oh yes, 2 and sometimes 3! Next comes in the nurse...saying \"He is MAD!!! He saw how long you have been waiting and he's getting you in!!\" So off I go.....appointment was at 11 am...this is about 2:30. No food (they had snack trays but who wants to eat!!) and they did the core biopsy first. Then across the hall for the sterotactic biopsy on right (couldn't do an ultrasound guided on it...too deep). The suspicious thing about the left breast lump is that the blood was flowing to it. Too bad my family Dr had told me how cancer pulls blood toward it. Too much info.....a little freaked here. But resorting to lack of control over all this. Have any of you heard of blood flowing to something that was ok?? Benign?? Crap. I hope so. This didn't show on the mammo from this vet clinic here (this hopital equipment isn't good - sorry for sarcasm)....and even didn't show on ultrasound at first surgeon. That huge cyst was hiding this lump :-( They said this sometimes happens. OH and another question.....they put discs in both breasts. I asked what those were for and they said 1) if it is something, the Dr will know exactly where to go and 2) if it isn't, then future mammos will see you have already had a biopsy in that place. I was thinking \"YEAH RIGHT....you all KNOW this is BOTH cancer and aren't telling me and you are getting me ready for the surgery that you KNOW is going to happen!!!\" That was my thoughts. Then I said \"well, do you know anyone who has a disc that was nothing?\" The radiologist sweetheart said \"I have one!!!!!\" Then they said \"OH yes, there are Millions of women out there with these!\" Does anyone here have this disc thing in you??? Or should I post another question about it to get attention from someone who does? So I guess the 2 questions are 1) have you heard of blood flow going to a lump but it was still benign and 2) have you heard of these discs?  are they routine for breast clinics? any info? Ok, thanks for listening. They told me I would know something Monday or Tuesday. Log in to post a reply",

I asked on my thread what you were going through, then I found this.  I've had several MRI's from wrecks I was in (in the past) and noone is allowed in the room with you. At least they weren't with me. In fact, even the person doing it was in another room, but had a speaker to talk to me and hear me. They really aren't that bad, noisy (the machine makes loud noises) but after going through the first one, I realized I could make up tunes or sing songs in my head to the different beats. Each of my MRI's were about 45 minutes. Being put under - I don't like that either. But when I had my hysterectomy 7 years ago I had to just do it. Actually, I had two surgeries, pretty much back to back - about 2 or 3 weeks apart. The Dr knew how scared I was and was there for me pretty well. He encouraged me to pray, which you don't get from every dr. Of course as luck would have he retired. But there are others out there.",

Interesting thing to share here. When I was there on the 31st, I could almost see the statistics I've read about here. Packed with women, large facility, most all equipment on location. Some women coming in for chemo, etc., others waiting for mammos and many getting biopsies that day. They were \"backed up on biopsies\".
