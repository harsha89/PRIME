Nice to hear from someone who feels the same way. How crazy that an onc dismissed the idea when you brought it up. I have definitely seen it in the medical literature as an option that should be discussed with HD survivors who had chest radiation. No onc I saw over the years ever discussed it with me, though I suppose I was vaguely aware of the idea anyway. But I never would have done it unless everything I wrote above could some how have been drilled into my head! In the year or so that has passed since I wrote that post, I still stick with what I wrote, but I would add that the whole fake boob thing did end up being more trouble than I had anticipated, mostly because I had pain for several months after the second surgery, but it seems to be getting better. Also, I had to cancel a surgery at the last minute when it was announced that textured implants are associated with--of all things--a rare lymphoma, so I went with smooth instead. Congrats on getting through some really tough cancer treatments....you make me look like a real lightweight! ",

      "Content": "Mar 26, 2017 12:23PM - edited Mar 26, 2017 02:44PM by surfscoter I haven't read through all the posts in this thread, but I wanted to share my personal conclusion on the Hodgkin's (with mantle radiation) to breast cancer journey... In retrospect, I wish I had gotten a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy (P-BMX), and this is the advice I would now give to someone in my position. Admittedly, had someone suggested this to me, I would have dismissed them, but with the benefit of hindsight, I now think differently. Here are the pluses I see:  So, in conclusion, if I could get in a time machine and go visit my younger self, I would tell her to get a P-BMX. In my opinion, even if you have a 70-80% chance of never getting breast cancer (to put things in positive terms), it would still be worth it just to avoid the stress of the diagnosis and treatment, and of course the increased chances of a grim outcome. Fake or no boobs turn out to be a surprisingly minor downside and you will soon forget about the brief misery of the surgery itself. Keep in mind this advice applies only to HD survivors who got chest rads and I believe those who got MOPP have lower risk because of premature menopause, though I'm not sure how much lower.",
