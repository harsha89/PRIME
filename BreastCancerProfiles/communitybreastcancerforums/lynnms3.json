We waited until after the first lumpectomy and knew what the plan was before we told them. We actually never told the youngest the entire truth, just a sugar coated version since I did not need chemo. I guess the best thing I did was just take it day by day. Try not to overwhelm yourself. Try and get rest, it will make it easier to deal with. Lean on your support system, they want to be there for you. Prayers for you. You will get through!",
