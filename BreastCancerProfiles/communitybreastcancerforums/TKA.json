I just received my diagnosis on the 21st and right now that is all I know- that I have Invasive Lobular Carcinoma and that the tumor appears to be 7cm according to Mammo and US.  BUT, we have a great facility in Columbus, Ohio called the Stephanie Spielman Center which is part of the Ohio State Univ. James Cancer system.  I was referred there right away from my primary care when I developed symptoms (lump, swelling, inverted nipple).  I see my surgical oncologist and have an MRI plus stereostatic biopsy on Friday.  Still, I started this journey in October and now only have a diagnosis. Do you have a primary care physician that may be able to help you get to see a surgeon more quickly?  ",

I agree with the waiting, the not knowing is the worst!  You have completed a big step though and I hope your healing and recovery will be fast!",
