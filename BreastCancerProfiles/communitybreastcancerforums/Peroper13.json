My plastic surgeon sent me to a breast cancer surgeon . She had her hospital review the slides of my path report as they were from another hospital. Breast surgeon called today and told me that the path. From her hospital says they don t see any atypia which the first report did see. She still wants me to have genetic counseling because my 2 aunts had bc and my brother has colorectal cancer which could indicate family gene mutation. My question is this. Because of the difference of path report findings, should I get a third opinion on the pathology. I do have an appt. for genetic counseling. I am happy about the second opinion but at the same time scared.the first report was reviewed by two pathologist, don t know about the second. Any thoughts would be helpful. Log in to post a reply",

She feels that I m not at high risk for any family risks but my Gail score was still 1.7. She said that is a little high and says I meet the requirements for preventive treatment. I also suggested another pathologist review and she thought that was a good idea. I see my breast surgeon soon and will question her about that. I feel better that the counselor doesn't t feel I need any testing but am concerned that they are only suggesting a follow up mammo in a year. Will keep you posted . God bless",
