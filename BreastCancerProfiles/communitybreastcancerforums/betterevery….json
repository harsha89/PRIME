HaHa.  When I was diagnosed on June 24, 2009, the prognosis was not good.  Women with my type of \"invasive, extremely agressive\" breast cancer had little, if any hope. Out of 100 women 89 would die during chemo 8 during radiation and the other 3 would be gone by 12 months, 2 days.  Every day since June 26, 2010 is just icing on the cake. Even with the pain.   ",

My stupidity tolerance levels are not what they used to be.  But here I find answers, recommendations fot help, links to where to find help, and women who share their good days, bad days and love. Mental and physical help from the women who've been there, going there, and are winning the war.   ",
