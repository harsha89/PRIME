MRI showed suspicious lesions in the right that needed to be biopsied. I opted for the bmx because I did not ever want to worry about this for a few more years....if the lesions in the right breast turned into anything- outcome for me would have been the same (BMX). my BS says studies showed that women are usually happier with results when both breasts are done. I had immediate reconstruction and I am completely thrilled with them... I ended up with four tumors in my left breast- right was clear. I am very happy with my decision.",

I can get to a recommended surgeon at Dana Farber beginning of August- does anyone think this is an okay time to wait",
