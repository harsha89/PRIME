      "Content": "Paola wrote: It has been a crazy past couple days.. I found out after 2 mammograms and an ultrasound that they found a 6mm lobular nodule, 9:00 position right breast on mammogram shown to be complicated or solid, category 4- Suspicious for malignancy. My surgery is scheduled for  Friday, July 9th in the morning to remove the mass and have a biopsy done on it.. I am nervous and very anxious about the whole thing.. My husbands first wife passed away from Breast Cancer in 1995, so for him it is even worse.  I try to be the one to keep the calm, but inside i feel like crying, screaming.  I meet with the surgeon yesterday and even though i left there feeling better, he obvisously could not offer me an positive answer that it would be benign.  Any words of encouragment would be great, especially if you have been at this point, as far as what to expect before and after.
