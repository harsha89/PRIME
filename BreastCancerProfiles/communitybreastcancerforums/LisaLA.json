I had a double mastectomy on 3/31 and start chemo (6 cycles of T/C/H) on 5/22 followed by a year of Herceptin.  The delay between surgery and chemo is because I went through a fertility process to freeze embryos as I'm single (41) and am afraid of the possibility of early menapause.  This is actually one of my biggest fears of this whole process. My port was inserted last Monday and it's been tough ever since as it significantly impacted my mobility in that arm. It's frustrating because I actually did really well in regaining my mobility after surgery (could get both arms easily up over my head) only to have it reduced from the port. Hopefully this is just temporary. Has anyone else had the same experience?   Anyway....just wanted to join the chat to connect with others starting chemo around now. I feel very ready to get this next phase of treatment started...and then over as as quickly as possible!  I wish everyone else in this chat all the best as you undergo your treatments. Lisa",

I'm sorry your second port is uncomfortable and thank for passing along the possible reason for my port discomfort from AlaskaDeb that it may be due to too much fat on my arm.  I'm only 105 pounds with toned arms so I was actually thinking it might be the opposite reason...not enough fat. Hmmmm.  I guess I'll ask my doctor and hope that it's not due to problems with the port insertion.  I feel like I got through the surgery just fine but this port problem is stressing me out.  On a positive note, I did my first hike since surgery today! It felt great to get outside and exercise again...both physically and emotionally.  I'm ready for chemo to start now....bring it on! Lisa",
