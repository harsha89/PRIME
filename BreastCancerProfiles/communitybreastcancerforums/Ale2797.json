It's kind of a \"funny\" story how i found it, i really thought i couldn't have breast cancer at a young age, it was until my aunt got diagnosed with bc (stage 0, all good) that just for curiosity i started checking myself, and to my total surprise i had a small lump. Obviously i instantly thought it was cancer since i didn't know you could have bening breast tumors and i'm a little bit hypochondriac lol. My lump is like 2 cm, movable, doesn't hurt at all, smooth, sometimes hard and sometimes not so much(?) and it hasn't changed in size since i discovered it. I went to my gyn like 4 weeks ago because i got scared to go sooner, but my mom and i realized that we needed to know what's up. My gyn told me that it felt like a fibroadenoma, he then made me and ultrasound and said it also looked like one, but of course he can't confirm. He said i need to go to a radiologist to get it checked to see if i need to get it out but i need to wait till my period is over i don't know why. i'm really stressed out, my family and bf tell me it's probably nothing but they don't know the stress of having something you don't know what it is!! Also i'm not very happy about the posibility of a surgery I'm trying to stay calm but of course google doesn't help at all (i know it's my fault though lol) any recommendations or stories of fibroadenomas are very welcome! I feel like i need someone who understands my situation lol Log in to post a reply",

I'm really hoping it's bening, i constantly check it (even if my gyn told me no to touch it) just to reassure myself that it feels bening but i guess no one can really know until you have a biopsy. Thank you all again:)",
