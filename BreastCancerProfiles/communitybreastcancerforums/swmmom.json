Breast feels pretty hard, especially the lower part. you can tell I developed fibrous tissue around the lower part of the breast.  A few weeks ago, I started feeling some tingling around the elbow area and my arm started feeling a bit heavy. Oncologist did ultrasound to rule out blood clots and the results were okay. Both my oncologist and breast surgeon didn't  think my arm looked swollen or any different than my other arm.  Just to be sure, I asked for a referral for a Lymphedema therapist. Make long story short, I had my apt with the therapist today.  I asked the therapist if she would be able to tell whether I had lymphedema or not, and she said, \" oh, you have lymphedema.\" At this point, she didn't even see my arm nor did she ask any questions about my symptoms, history, etc.  She just said if your doctor sent you here then you have lymphedema.  She measured both of my arms, didn't tell me what the measurements were and started taping my arm right away. After she was done, I asked her for a massage, and she said she would show me how to do the massage on my next visit.  I also asked her if she could do something to get rid of the hardness on the breast skin, and she said she had no time for the breast today and she would put some kind of foam in my bra on my next visit and that would help the fibrous tissue. What kind of foam is she talking about? Is it uncomfortable to use?   Anyways ladies, needless to say, my arm feels like it is in a cast and feels very uncomfortable. She wrapped me all the way from my shoulders to my knockles even though I have no discomfort or swolling on my hands.  She said I'd have to wear the bandages 23 hours a day. I just want to rip them off off my arm right now, so I can't even imagine wearing them 24/7.  I mean I will absolutely wear the bandages if I have to , but if I don't have lymphedema then I certainly don't want to put myself through the discomfort. When I finally asked her about my measurements, she said my affected arm was 1-2 cm wider than my other arm in three different areas ( around the elbow). 1-2 cm doesn't sound like a big difference to me between two arms and I would like to hear your thoughts on this. I also asked her if I should exercise and she said whatever I can do without feeling pain is fine. Are there any special exercises to minimize the negative effects of lymphedema or any exercises I should avoid?   I was really looking forward to my apt today,but I just didn't get a good feel from my visit. Do you think she should have examined my arm or at least ask me some questions regarding my history and symptoms before bandaging my arm or massage the arm/ breast and show me some exercises to do? Therapist also said that I would need a sleeve after my swolling went down. My arm doesn't even look swollen now.  By the way, I looked at some pictures on the Internet and the sleeve looks so much easier to wear than the bandages. Am I correct on this?   I am sorry, this post is too long, but I feel overwhelmed right now and need some answers. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

What a difference can a good therapist make!  She took my history, examined my arm and breast, measured my arm, went over the measurements with me and covered all the treatment options with great detail. Since my swelling was minumum (only around the elbow) she said I might get away with just wearing a sleeve when I am active, but suggested that we try the wrapping for about two weeks to bring the swelling down and then get a sleeve. She thought me how to do the massage and wrapping and made sure I knew how to wrap correctly by myself before leaving her office.  She showed me a few exercises to do and encouraged me to use weights that I am comfortable with and also added that I should do belly/diaphram breathing before and after working out. She gave me a whole bunch of handouts and booked another appointment for tomorrow. So all in all, not a bad appointment, eh? I will keep you posted on my future appointments.  Thanks again for all your suggestions and advice.",

I truly appreciate you taking the time to explain everything to me in great details. thank you again, I feel so much better knowing that my therapist did everything right. They scheduled me with a different therapist for my next apt, not my choice, it is a very busy rehab center. I am hoping to have a better chemistry with the next therapist. I was  a good girl and didn't take off the bandages last night. They feel a lot loser this morning. Is this normal? I don't want to dare to take them off and rewrap b/c I don't know if I could wrap the arm by myself. But I have to take it off at some point, right? Or I would be walking around smellling pretty nasty! One question: If the swelling comes down and my measurements improve, does that mean I will be done with the treatments or does my arm have to be wrapped from now on? Binny, as for my screen name, I don't even know how to swim! My 12 year old daughter is a competitive swimmer and she is quite good at it too.  I told her she would have to teach me how to swim and she said it would cost me.   I was a personal fitness trainer before my diagnosis. As you can imagine, I was very fit and in shape. Not any more though! Thanks to chemo and Arimidex, I am 30 pounds heavier. I was pretty emotional yesterday. I couldn't stop crying. I felt handicapped and l felt like I couldn't do anything with the wrap.  I am feeling a lot better this morning though, which reminds me it is time to wash the sink full of dishes.  Thanks again for your response and have a great weekend.",

I totally agree with you, a water aerobics class would be a more economical way to go than the \"private\" swim lessons!  She also said that there are no cost negotiations. She is a little stinker!",

Just because my arm was slightly larger than my other arm didn't mean I had Lymphedema. I thought starting therapy early would reverse the situation, but I really should have just waited and kept an eye on my arm.  My sleeve caused me to gain 2 inches on my upper arm, which was never swollen before. My index finger also started to swell after the therapy, which also was normal before the therapy. I have a thick crease mark inside of my elbow from bandages and it is not going away.  I think if you have very mild swelling in your arm and  it is not visible to the naked eye, you might be better off waiting and keeping an eye on things. Some changes are on the affected arm are normal as a result of surgery, chemo, radiation. etc not becaused your lymphatic system is totally impaired.  I am now only using elevation and mild arm exercises as therapy and my arm actually looks better. I understand everyone's situation is different and therapy can be beneficial for many, but in my situation it was not.",

They did a chest CT and it showed radiation induced pneumonitis. My doctor said since I have no coughing and my symptoms are mild, he will let it run its course. I guess it is reversible.  I don't know if I feel comfortable about not getting treated for it since my wheezing is getting worst. I definetely don't want to it progress to lung fibrosis. I should also mention that I am a non-smoker. Has anyone experienced this or am I one of the few lucky ones to get this pneumonitis crap?   Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "swmmom wrote: After two weeks of wrapping, I finally got a prescription for a 20-30 mmHg compression sleeve.  I went to a very reputable medical store here in St louis and the lady who measured my arm gave me one off the shelf. It is a Jobst brand, size medium sleeve with slicone border. The sleeve is very comfortable and it sure beats the wraps, but the slicone part of the sleeve is extremely tight and cuts through my skin around my upper and under arm.  It really hurts, so I quit wearing it.  I also think  that the length of the sleeve is too long. It comes all the way up to my shoulders. Is this how it is supposed to feel or do you think I was not given the right size of sleeve and might need a custom fit sleeve?  I mean I thought we were supposed to avoid tight/constricted clothing on the affected arm not to worsen our already comprised circulatory system. The upper part of the sleeve was beyond tight. It left a huge red mark on my skin. My next appointment with the therapist is on Monday and I will take the sleeve with me for her to see, but I wanted to get your opinions in the mean time.  Thanks in advance, Dee  Log in to post a reply",
