I had a needle aspiration in 1999...with no anesthesia at all! it hurt more than childbirth, it was truly aweful. the good thing was it was benign. I am so concerned now about the pain and the results. I hope and pray that you will be just fine and it is nothing of concern. Warmest and Best Wishes, Teri",

I think that since I had that awful first experience I am just overly scared of everything. Tomorrow I go for U/S of both breasts, though the real issue is in the upper outer quad of the right breast. It's a node that seems to have grown since the last mammogram. Hopefully it will be clear enough inÂ  the U/S and it is nothing and i can just move on! My thoughts are with you Bunny!",
