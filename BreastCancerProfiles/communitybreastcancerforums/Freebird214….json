I am from India and currently living in India which makes it even worse as It is hard to get these drugs at affordable prices here.I don't have any insurance that i can use and neither do they have any clinical trials in India that I can enrol myself for. Confused and somewhat dejected I fail to understand what next to do.I have been fighting all this way since 2010 but not the fight gets a little more tougher. If any of you here have any ideas about getting this highly over priced wonder drug for cheap,kindly let me know. Last but not the least I congratulate you all for doing such a commendable job in supporting this forum.It really helps and takes your mind off it (Ca) for a moment and makes one feel good.Makes one feel that I am not alone out there.There are alot more like me,alot more who are fighting it out like me,and alot more who are confident that they will beat it one day.",
