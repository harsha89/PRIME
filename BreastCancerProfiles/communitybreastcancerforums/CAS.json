Thanks for advice.  Hugs....carol",

Also this is a recurrence.  I did not have chemo the first time around four years ago but did have radiation and a lumpectomy.  Has anyone has the second round of chemo and does it have the same affect as the first.  Just curious to see what I will be going through at the end of next week.  It if was a simple as the first round, I can take this.....Also have to give myself a shot to build up my white blood cells every day for 7 days.  I gave that job to my husband....Hope everyone is hanging in there and just think after all my chemo, I then get to have my surgery.  Lovely.  When does my hair leave me?  Thanks...Carol from S.F. ",
