I have a wonderful support group(family and friends, but sometimes it is better to hear from people who have been through this difficult journey.  Thanks so all the wonderful tips and support!!!!",

Has anyone had one that large or larger???  What tests do most dr. ask for before surgery?  I've had an mri, and will be going for a bone scan on mon.  That concerns be. I still don't know what treatment or when the surgery will be!!! The waiting is horrible!!!! ",

I am taking a exercise class before I go to rad's...this has helped me emotionally a whole bunch.  I put a cream on my breast that the doctor gave me as soon as I come out of radiation each day.  When I get home, I slather aloe vera on my breast ( my plant looks awful - haha)...so far I have not had the redness etc.  ",
