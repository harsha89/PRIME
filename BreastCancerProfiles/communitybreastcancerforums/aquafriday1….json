This has actually alleviated a lot of the worry I've been stewing over the past few months, so that's a plus. I feel a vague sense of - dare I say it - relief? That maybe this won't be as much a death sentence as I've been building it up in my mind. I am starting to read Living Well Beyond Cancer and there was a line in there, something to the effect of it isn't jinxing myself to plan for later down the line, and I just cried because YES, that is EXACTLY what I am feeling. Almost like, what right do I have to plan now? Everything is up in the air. And me being a \"planner,\" it's tremendously unsettling.",

More so now that I KNOW I have cancer, I'm worrying about every little thing. Like, oh my period has been weird the past few months, must be cancer. My head hurts, I hope it isn't cancer. That type of thinking. I waited going to the doctor for this lump for months just thinking it was nothing, so now I'm wondering if all the other things going on are true issues and I should do something about them. Maybe cancer has made me insane. Could be either. ;)",

I spoke with the nurse at the RO's office and she helped me feel more relaxed about everything. Basically she said I need to get off the internet, lol. Everyone's different and my future is not foretold based on what happens to everyone else. It's harder than I thought to get the idea out of my mind but I'm at least starting to narrate future events in my life in terms of \"when\" instead of \"if.\" I never did get those anxiety meds because the RO told me to go back to my PCP for that and I honestly don't want to deal with the hassle of yet another doctor appointment (and my PCP is an hour away - long story). How have you been feeling? More settled? More optimistic?",

Is that dumb? I don't know if it will help, being around other people. I can't stop crying when I talk to anyone who isn't family about what's going on (doctors, etc). Today at the radiologist's he asked how I was doing and started sobbing before I even realized what was happening. I felt ridiculous even though I'm sure it happens all the time. Anyway. I think it's good that there is a board like this. I'm just probably going to worry forever. The rad onc didn't want to prescribe me any sort of xanax or anything, he said to see my regular doctor, which is a laugh (I never had one, all this went through my ob/gyn and then straight to a breast surgeon). Things are a straight up mess right now. But I'm still alive, so.... ;)",

Just the fact that this has come up, and cancer is such a huge unknown to the medical community for the most part, and I don't know what will eventually happen to me, is driving me crazy. I told my husband the other day that it feels like I already have one foot in a grave with all this, not from this bout of cancer but from the next one that'll inevitably kill me. I don't know how to make my mind stop jumping to that because I know logically that from what all the doctors are telling me, I'll be fine. But then I see everyone's signatures in their posts and people who started out where I am were suddenly stage IV and on their last legs. I've never felt such an intense fear before, and it's like I'm almost resigned to it happening. Clearly not the best way to start a recovery and fight this, with this kind of thinking. I plan on asking the doctor about my staging because you're right, the tumor itself was small and I had no lymph involvement, so I don't know what made him bump me up. Could be I'm remembering wrong, I seem to be forgetting everything but my own name at this point. I'm planning on attending a group session next week to see if it's the right thing for me. Either way I know I need something.",

He does his best to make me feel like this is just a blip in our (long) lives together but there's no way to make him understand how my brain has taken a nosedive off the deep end. I'm not \"that\" person that worries about every little bump and ache. But suddenly, I'm the person it happened to when all my life I've been saying it wouldn't happen to me. Lisa, thank you for putting this into perspective! I hadn't even thought of things that way about people leaving the boards. I suppose it's true that people wouldn't stick around once they're \"cured\" and I'm not even worried about this particular diagnosis. It sucks but it's treatable. I'm worried about what may come next, the more aggressive version, the mets to somewhere I wasn't prepared for. This dx has changed everything about how I think about life. I've considered going to Sloan Kettering but it'd be a huge hassle going into NYC for every radiation treatment and appointment, and I have heard mixed reviews. It makes me wish I were back in Boston to go to Dana Farber (one of many reasons I wish we hadn't left but I digress...) I'm Diane, btw. Really, thanks to everyone. Actually talking about this instead of pretending things are ok has been pretty helpful. Who would have guessed.",
