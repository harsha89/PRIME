    "Content": "charlestongirl63 wrote: Through the years I've been on Fareston, Tamoxifen, Femara and Arimidex.  In Feb. 2011 the bone mets had morphed into mets in the liver, too many to count and diffusely located.  Chemo was begun two days later, so I wasn't able to get a liver biopsy.  I do have some bone mets.  So how does the oncologist determine if an estrogen positive cancer has become estrogen negative?  Do we just assume this happened because the hormonal therapies don't work, or would it take a biopsy to be sure?  And can a bone met be biopsied?  I'm a little anxious about this topic because while on Taxol/carboplatin/avastin I had no period.  Now that I've been on Xeloda since end of August, I can tell the hormones are beginning to wake up.  My oncologist has said it's of no concern...any thoughts?
