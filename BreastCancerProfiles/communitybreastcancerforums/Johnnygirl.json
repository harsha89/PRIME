The dust is starting to settle a little for me and now I'm trying to fully understand it all and get validation that I'm on the right track. I had several small concentrations of IDC (largest being 5mm) alongside a large (9cm) DCIS tumor. Stage 1A IDC. No node involvement. I am 3 weeks out from a bilateral mastectomy. That is the only treatment I've had so far. I don't see my Medical Oncologist for 2 more weeks but I've been told that I will have hormonal therapy (I am HER2-/ER+/PR+) and that radiation is a possibility - my case is borderline and the MO will make the call. I have not had the oncotype test. Does this seem in line with what you all have experienced? Should I push for the oncotype test? What would that tell me? Is radiation common or uncommon in my situation? Is there anything else I should be asking when I see my MO?
