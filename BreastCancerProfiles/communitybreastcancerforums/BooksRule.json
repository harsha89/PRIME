Then, I came back later that afternoon for a needle biopsy.  There was a three-week gap from that until I met with the BS (on a Tuesday).  I then had an excisional biopsy the next day (not because my case was an emergency or anything--she just had an opening and I took it).  I got my results (B9) that next Tuesday. I would think that if they saw something on the mammo/US that needs further investigation (such as with some type of biopsy) you would at least be informed that further action should be taken, even if they don't schedule any further testing until after the holidays.  I guess it will all depend on what they see and how full everyone's schedules are getting.  I would certainly hope that if they see something that would need some type of biopsy, you would not be left in the dark until after the holidays and then get a phone call or letter that says,  'Oh, by the way, you need to have.......[fill in the blank with whatever test they need].  Please give us a call to schedule, yadda, yadda, yadda'. I know how you feel.  It's hard to enjoy the upcoming holidays with things like this hanging over your head. Lisa",

I knew my BIRADS rating (5) and my research told me that this was bad.  I also 'googled' (always a bad idea to rely on Dr. Google) radial scars and didn't like what I read.  Almost every site's information contradicted the previous one.  I was really confused.  About the only thing that they all seemed to agree on was that radial scars should be removed.  And, among other risk factors, my mom and maternal aunt were breast cancer survivors.  I hoped for the best but prepared myself for the worst (if that is ever possible).  However, in my particular case, everything worked out okay.  The radial scar was removed and everything came back benign. So, it's scary, but the outcome is not always bad.  Arm yourself with good information (from reliable websites such as this one) and make a list of questions to ask your doctor.  Good luck!",

I didn't have much pain at all.  I mainly had some trouble recovering from the anesthesia (I'd never had anything but a local before), so it was a couple of days before I got over my dry mouth and vertigo.  But each person reacts differently from anesthesia.  Most have no problems at all.  I had more pain from the nurse's (tech's?) efforts trying to get my IV in than from the surgery recovery. I had my surgery on a Wednesday, and I think I could have gone back to work on Friday if I hadn't had those anesthesia problems.  I took the rest of the week off and went back on Monday. I think it's a good thing to have a radial scar removed.  I personally didn't want it lingering in me! Good luck!",

Since you have an appointment with the breast surgeon soon, you can ask about it.  But if it's not really painful or appears inflamed or infected, it's probably alright Please let us know how everything goes!",
