Our Onc has been very good for the past 13 years and I have very good confidence in her however I was wondering why I see many people saying they have been given Chemo right off the bat. She has perscribed Femara only for now and has not mentioned anything about chemo again. First cancer in 94 then again in 2007 and lung mets in November of 2008.",
