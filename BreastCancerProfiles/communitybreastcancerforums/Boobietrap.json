Week one was full of character building, nausea, vomiting, heartburn and headaches but made it through. Fatigue and the lack of taste are ongoing.Was curious what folks timeline was on hair loss? I have noticed mine thinning but no big clumps yet.likely going to shave my head in the next day or so to beat cancer to the punch but have been holding out because it's cold right now. (I have a stock pile of beanies.) Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  Best, Boobietrap",
