Bottom line is, I want to get well and live my life.  I thought I was going to be able to do that without the mastectomy but the BRCA results cannot be ignored.  I am just having a hard time accepting it. I am going to search for a good surgeon.  I have great drs at Baylor in Dallas.  I'm sure they can recommend a good plastic surgeon.  Just wanted to talk to some of you out there who have actually gone through it.",

I will be having my ovary removed (only have 1 past history of cysts the other was previously removed years ago) and possibly my uterus.  Saw the OBGYN today.  I meet with the breast surgeon in 2 weeks after my first mamo post treatment. I had breast augmentation 4 years ago.  Under muscle, 700cc saline implants.  I am a larger woman - size 12 and wanted boobs to match my butt size!!!!  Have had no problems with my implants and have grown quite fond of the \"girls\".  Now they are pushing me to get a double mastecomy with immediate reconstruction.  I am currently cancer free and just starting to get well from the past several months of treatment.  I'm scared to death to get a mastectomy.  My boobs are the best looking part of my body - even after the 2 surgeries. Can they re-build them with large implants and make them look good again?????  I know, I know, what a vain thing to think about when faced with the possibility of the cancer coming back.  I can't help it, right now, after what I've gone through, I feel a little attached to what I have left. Also, how bad is the surgery - my implants are under the muscle so would I still need tissue expansion?  How is the scarring?  My lumpectomy scar is already almost invisible.  How much pain?  Recoup time?   Anyone out there who has had implants prior to dx and had mastectomy with reconstruction that can help me have a better understanding of what I am facing if I go forward with the mastectomy?  Thanks so much!  Dx 11/11/2009, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 1/15 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
