Just a follow up with the nurse. I'm still left going wth just happened. Guess I find out Thursday. So what are some benign issues that form hard undetectable masses in your breast? Is that typical for fibrocystic breast issues? I'm really just trying to figure out how much I should be concerned at this point....as I kinda got shock-ey and didn't ask.   Log in to post a reply",

I am also breastfeeding and have a palpable mass in my right breast. Had diagnostic mamo and ultrasound and they said my breasts were very, very dense and gave me a birads zero.  They couldn't see the mass which means it's likely tissue but they didn't feel like they could see well at all so..... I am going in every two months and then they will do a follow up diagnostic mammo and ultrasound after 6 months or possibly an MRI.  I choose not to have an attempted biopsy done at this time but that was me. Sounds like they are keeping a good eye on you! ",

Derived from the Sanskrit word 'svastika', it is considered a sacred symbol in Hinduism, which is considered to be auspicious.\"  Not that this is necessarily the case here but it could be.",

They found atypical hyperplasia and two nodular lactational hyperplasia or aka lactational adenomas. They've followed me for about 4 months now.....due to very high breast density and fibrosis the adenomas don't show on ultrasound at all, despite being extremely palpable and large.  They said even though the adenomas haven't changed in the last 4 months I am showing a lot of progression in symptoms such as deepening and new dents, dimpling and nipple pull. They want me to wean the baby and to go back in 2 1/2 months again for a likely breast MRI.  Two weeks after my biopsy I developed another third but much smaller lump. and a new indent. Should I call and inform them or just cross it off my mind until then.....and does this sound like a good plan of action? They said the MRI would be less effective while nursing ....and both ultrasound and mammogram are ineffective too.  My biopsies were blind and she said that doesn't help rule bad stuff out as well as if it was ultrasound guided.  Log in to post a reply",
