    "Content": "topate789 wrote: Hello everyone, I'm 21 years old and maybe 2 weeks ago have detected a 1 cm big let's say wound on my right nipple. Let me explain and describe. It is at 5 o'clock and looks like something bit me (I assumed it was that at first). First, it was like a pimple (but without anything in it), and a few days later it looked like I scratched it and became like a small wound. It reminds me of herpes zoster (I had it 2 years ago) because of its looks. It is not big, but you would feel it under your fingers like a little 2 mm bulge (not lump), even though its texture is like nipples. It doesn't hurt me. I was first concerned with this being visible, but now I am afraid of Pagent's disease. I am only 21 years old, always have been healthy, not overweight and I don't have breast cancer records in the family. I'm afraid to go to the doctor or to tell my mom because she will panic. Lately, I have been under a lot of stress and I was not eating clean (not that many fruits actually). I also have to say that I was ovulating when this first came out and a few days ago it looked like it was getting better, but today I got my period and my breasts and nipples are huge (I always have these changes in the cycle), so I can't tell how is it at this moment. What do you think? Please, only concrete answers because I am really worried. Is it possible I have any type of breast cancer, or in the worst case Pagent's disease? Or is it just some kind of skin condition, or yeast infection (I found this can be a symptom). And would you recommend any kind of treatment to help this wound heal. Thanks in advance.
