As long as I am still or walking.. pain level is fine on half doses of hydrocodone ... but getting up and down is tough and the bra is cutting into me. My daughter put a sock to help. Kinda scared to change bras as I don't know if the other will be better and just the act of changing them.... have one JP drain hoping to get rid of it at my Wed checkup with my BS. Good luck all!",

Milk of Magnesia TOPICALLY (on the hives, not by mouth!) worked great to take away the itch and drop down the hives in moments.  Hopefully that can work for you too if you ever have them again.   :)   ",

Started the Claritin D the day prior to chemo day and still daily... so far no pain from the Neulasta. I noticed one of my nausea meds says Headache for side effects... and yep I have a doozy! Alleve helping though! Not much by way of appetite... but enjoying watermelon to help with fluids. For some reason the only other thing am interested in ... is pudding (sigh) I feel like most things taste like rotten eggs.... so sucking Jolly Ranchers has helped in that regard. Also lots of mouth rinsing... after every meal I brush and rinse with Biotine, and extra rinses in between as well. Seems most of you are dealing with about the same issues. We CAN do this! Blessings and Hugs!",

Hope yours get better fast! I am day 6 out from chemo 2... can't believe how awful I still feel and wondering if I can make the other two A.C. . I have to tho as am opting out of Taxol. We are moving Saturday and just physically can't pack any more so will need to pay the movers.... ah well can't be helped! Had to say goodbye to my PC today due to the move get all new doctors..... she and I both cried, hugged and she prayed for me. I really love her as a sister, not just as a doctor. So it was an emotional day and that is tiring too. Anyone else really struggling to make it through after only 2 rounds? I am 59 and have so many other health issues so just don't know if that's it or not.... Hugs!!! Dina",

I had the Bard Power Port placed Tuesday under general anesthesia. It really wasn't bad and I didn't need any pain medicine when I woke up but I was starving so my husband and I had dinner out before going home. I was definately sore the first couple of days, but showered the next day and even went shopping and to lunch with my daughter. Went quickly hack to my normal routine. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Good luck!",
