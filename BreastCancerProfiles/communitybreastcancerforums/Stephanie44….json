I guess I just want to have some hope! My aunt went to the doctor yesterday to do a mammogram because she was having pain in her breast for a long time ago. She is the type of person that will not go the doctors unless she feel like she need to. After the visit we found out that she have breast cancer stage IV. How can she know and be diagnosed with breast cancer stage IV without a biopsy? If this can be possible? Please Im so confuse and at the same time so sad and depress couldnt sleep last night thinking on this. My aunt is like my second mother this is very hard!! Any information that you can provide will be greatly appreciate! Sincerely, Stephanie",
