Around my port has been aching for the past few days and occasionally I'll get a mild ache in my neck (where the catheter is) or the back of the neck, today even into the back of my shoulder.

I did a lumpectomy, and am now preparing to start chemo (though I might decide to reject it at any moment, it's an incredibly difficult decision to make and as I said, I'm terrified of it.) Here's something to consider - if you have neoadjuvant chemo and the tumor shrinks, you'll know it has some effect. If you have the tumor removed and then do chemo, you have no way of knowing if your cancer is responding to chemo - as I understand it, they don't have a way to test for effectiveness after the tumor is gone, you're just going on statistics and hope. I find myself in this situation now and I hate it.",

I'd never had my heart scanned for anything before, so this was to set baselines. I was fascinated talking to the tech, she explained everything she was doing, all the things she was looking at and recording in my heart (both moving pictures and sound), and we talked about how it's similar to echolocation used by bats - sound waves creating images. She was also listening to the Black Keys, which helped, for me :D Thanks all for the guidance, as usual!",

The CT isn't until June 4 and the echo is June 16! It's frustrating to finally make a decision then have to wait to go through with it. I'm hoping someone will cancel and I can reschedule both scans to happen sooner. My lumpectomy was Apr 27 and I've read that chemo isn't effective if initiated more than 12 weeks after surgery - I feel like the clock is ticking! (I'll try to find those studies...) I also have to get a port, and my MO isn't concerned about whether it's put in before chemo starts or after my first infusion - but I am!! I do NOT want to fight with my thin, deep veins on the first one!! The soonest I can consult with my surgeon (not even have the surgery itself) is July 1! Argh!!! End vent! Thanks for listening!

It's manageable with a bit of cannabis oil for the pain and I think I'll try to go to work tomorrow, but... wow. They did internal stitches and DermaBond on the outside - both incisions look pretty angry, but so far I think it's going as well as can be expected. If I move really slowly I have essentially full range of motion. I don't think it's pressing on any nerves (something I saw mentioned by folks elsewhere here). It's kind of achy all the way from the chest incision up to the neck incision, across the port and the catheter up to the jugular. How long until the pain goes away? Chemo starts next Tuesday. My husband REALLY does not want me to do it. Earlier this week he texted me a picture of someone's chemo-burned hand, as well as a link to a specific embalmer's fluid that is used for deceased people who have had extensive chemotherapy, because they're more likely to have clotted or congealed blood. He's really hoping he can get me to turn down chemo. I don't have any answers as to why I'm doing it that will satisfy him.",
