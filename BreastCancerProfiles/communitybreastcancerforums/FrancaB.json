I lost a son when I was younger he was five years old.  But you know from his existences so many amazing things happened - so in his brief 5 years of life in his own way he accomplished so much.  My point is that you are already accomplishing so much in this terrible journey, you are inspirational to all of us here and hope that you realize how meaningful your life is and will continue to be.   With your courage you have already accomplished so much.  If we help you in some small way - you are also helping us.  I send you a big hug that would take your breath away if I could do it in person.   Franca ",
