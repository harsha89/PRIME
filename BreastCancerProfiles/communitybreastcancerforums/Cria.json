I used the penguin cold caps and although it was a hassle, and my hair thinned, and my pony tail feels awfully skinny, people who don't know me would only think I have fine/thin hair. I'm pretty sure I have more than 50% left and am very happy with it since I got a trim a week ago (my hair is long and the ends were looking really scraggly). I don't know if you are in/close to the Twin Cities but there is a woman, Susan, in St. Paul who is kind of an \"independent contractor\" for Penguin Cold Caps. Her garage acts as a local warehouse, so you don't have to wait for shipping. She has employees who you can hire to do the capping for you, or you can pay her for a class to teach friends/family members how to cap. I paid for the class and my mom and two of my aunts did my capping for me. Susan has been doing this for 9 years since helping her sister and claims a 98% success rate of her clients keeping enough hair that they don't feel the need to wear a wig/hat/turban. She is pretty flexible as well, I talked to her on a Friday afternoon and we had class on Sunday evening and I started chemo on Monday! I have lots of additional tips, too, if you go the cold cap route. If you decide to let it go and shave it, I recommend turtle fur hats for outside. I've used their neck gators for years for down hill skiing, turtle fur is really soft, warm and comes in tons of colors. Additionally, I got eyebrow wigs from headcovers.com after my brows got thin and I love them. much easier for me than trying to draw them on. Best of luck to you, you're going to do great! Cria",

      "Content": "Dec 12, 2018 09:31PM Cria wrote: yellowb, I think we were pretty close to in synch with our chemo. I also did 12 weekly taxol, (started mid July) followed by 4 cycles of every other week A/C. I got my chemo at the University of Minnesota. My MO said that there are two studies that found doing taxol first was better than the reverse, but she also said that those two studies were not especially well done/strong studies, so it's probably 6 of one, half dozen of the other! It also made more sense for me because I left town a few days after my first infusion to work for two weeks half way across the country (did chemo there), and since AC is so much harsher she felt more comfortable with my being on taxol while out there. With the Taxol it didn't really bother me much til the last couple when muscle fatigue kicked my ass. I'd walk up the steps to my bedroom and have to lie down for 10 minutes to recover. Thighs felt like I'd done a major workout and would scream. Didn't have any nausea, weaned off all the premeds except for the pepcid, did cold capping as well as iced my hands, feet and ice chips in the mouth (should have sat naked in a freezer with an electric blanket around my boobs!). Really had minimal hair shedding with Taxol and cold capping. I think my eyebrows and lashes were just starting to thin at the end of the Taxol. With the AC, each round actually seemed easier than the last. I think the remainder of the Taxol combined with the AC on the first infusion and I had the worst side effects, which got better with each round (except for the fatigue, which was about the same or a little worse, and the taste changes which were different every day!). On the first round, infusion was on Tuesday and on Saturday I woke up peeing. There was no urge, no burning, try as hard as I could I could not stop peeing. It just streamed out. I was a little horrified. I think the muscle weakness/fatigue of the taxol combined with the AC and relaxed all the smooth muscle (sphincters). I didn't lose bowel control, but it was more lax and I had HORRIBLE heart burn (which I don't normally get) so I'm pretty sure the sphincter at the top of my stomach was defunct as well. Oh, and I got thrush that day, too. All symptoms were less severe on Sunday. Called onc RN on Monday (symptoms resolved by then, including thrush), she was concerned about UTI, got checked out on Tuesday and everything was fine. The leaky bladder and thrush repeated the weekend after infusion each time, but progressively less severe. My onc PA said she'd had one other patient who had a similar issue. Nausea: I occasionally felt a little queasy, but that's it. I do get motion sickness, and oral narcotics make me very nauseated, but I had no trouble with chemo. they gave me emend and aloxi, I took the oral steroids for three days after for the first and second round, but I was often taking them at like 2 pm and didn't have nausea, so I tried skipping them the third round and no issues, so didn't even get them for round four. Poop: I had a little constipation and used miralax a few times, but I had worse constipation during my out of town taxol rounds (stress + Aloxi). Turns out the anti nausea meds are totally constipating. Once those drugs wore off I ended up with loose stools but nothing uncontrollable. Did make things a little sore for a day or two each round. Neulasta: I had the auto injector and took generic claritin. I have environmental allergies normally so I take generic Zyrtec for those and I added the Claritin in addition (as it does nothing for my allergies). I started taking the claritin a day or two before infusion and continued for several days after, figured it couldn't hurt. I had NO pain from the neulasta. I had more joint pain from Taxol. Skin: got a rash on my chest from taxol that seemed like a reaction to my necklace, improved during AC, but got some acne-ish stuff under and between my boobs during AC. possibly from the steroids. Not too bad. Skin down below got very sensitive toward the middle/end of each cycle with underwear almost rubbing the skin raw where leg and body meet. MO hadn't heard this one before. It was not a yeast skin infection. I just think the skin is delicate there and the AC kept it from healing from minor trauma. Nails: I had nail issues towards the end of taxol. I'm pretty sure I would have been fine, but I was doing an outside project with brick-like pavers and I'm pretty sure that my grabbing them and carrying them was traumatic to my finger tips and I ended up with nail bed bruising several days later. That hurt! And after a particularly long walk the same thing happened to several of my toenails, so I'm pretty sure that increased pressure on finger tips/toes = injury to nail beds= messed up nails with eventual separation of that portion of the nail from the nail bed. They are growing out slowly. With AC they say you can see a stripe for each infusion. I have that on my thumbs and one index finger, on all the other nails its just one big whiter section, no distinct lines. Hair: I used Penguin cold caps and noted MAJOR shedding about 21-22 days after first AC. Scared the bleep out of me. It lasted a couple days and then decreased dramatically. Oncology PA told me other patients who did cold capping had a couple days of increased shedding with AC and then it slowed. The woman who I picked up my caps from and who I paid for a class for my mother and aunts to learn her capping techniques doesn't seem to know any of that. Overall the cold capping was pretty successful. I've thinned a lot all over and my ponytail feels ridiculously skinny, but people who don't know me would just think I have thinner hair. I met with the radiation oncologist and I think she kept forgetting that I did chemo since I had hair and commented on the fact that I didn't have a seroma at my lumpectomy site (I reminded her that my surgery was at the end of May and its now December!). I am curious as to when I might stop shedding and start to see some new growth. Brows and lashes: Went pretty quickly after starting AC, brows first, followed by lashes. I got eyebrow wigs from headcovers.com and I LOVE them! so much easier to glue those puppies on than try to draw them on and as a dark blond, none of the pencils/powders/gels are really the right color. Everyone at my infusion center was very impressed with them. I tried fake lashes one day, but my eyes water so much right now that they failed quickly. Might work better if I use the glue for my brows for the lashes. 23 days pfc and eyebrow fuzz is evident, not seeing any lash activity yet. Would really like lashes to keep the cat hair out of my eyes. Has anyone gotten insurance to pay for Latisse to help get lashes back after chemo? Overall, AC made me very fatigued for about a week, messed with my taste buds worse than taxol (improving but still not back to normal), gave me minor thrush for 1.5 days each round, and made me leak pee a few times, but was not anywhere as bad as I anticipated given the nicknames. To put a more positive spin on it we called it \"The Red Warrior\". Sorry about the novel, but I hope my experiences might reassure someone else. Warm wishes for speedy recovery for all! Cria ",

I think it seems like any thing that has lots of complex flavors/aromas sounds and smells good and then it doesn't taste like it should which is kind of shocking and disturbing to previously known reality. on the other hand, when you have something bland, there isn't much expectation of flavor explosion, so when it doesn't come it isn't a shock or disappointment. Scrambled eggs, french toast, peanutbutter sandwiches, club crackers, cinnamon sugar toast have all been relatively good for me on the worst days and I get more normal as the next chemo approaches. For fluids, I like fruit punch PowerAde. It has a little flavor, a little sweet, no aspartame, and there is coconut oil in it which gives it a little more of a mouth feel when you drink it. Sweet things have continued to taste pretty good too, pistachio oreos, twizzlers and nibs, not great for the weight gain, though. I've started to describe the taste disappointment to other people this way: you have a fantastic perfectly ripe HoneyCrisp apple that you are about to bite into. you are expecting the sweet, crisp, juicy somewhat tart mouthwatering perfect first bite and you take that bite and it ends up tasting like a bite of a Red Delicious from your elementary school lunch .",
