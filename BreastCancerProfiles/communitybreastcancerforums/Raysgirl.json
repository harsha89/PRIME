This sucks big time for us all but there is a lot of support on this site and a lot of hope when you see how long woman have been living with Stage IV. ",

I woke up in October without being able to put any weight on my right leg. Test revealed a stress fracture.  So, I stayed off of it as much as possible, used a cane/walker and the pain went away, but the leg felt weak.  Additional tests one month later revealed a fracture in the femoral neck.  In my case (and our cases may be very different) he suggested a partial hip replacement.  After getting a second opinion which confirmed the diagnosis, I scheduled surgery for Jan. 6 (great way to start the new year).  Again, in my case, I couldn't walk without assistance and I didn't want to stay that way.  The info from the doctor was that its better to catch the fracture while still \"impending\" to not wait to deal with it once it actually does fracture.  But, thats what I would ask, what happens if I do nothing.  If you go to a surgeon, they usually suggest surgery, right?  I also went to a orthopeadic oncologist, rather than a regular one and I felt like I was in better hands. BTW, I have borrowed your quote above and shared it with my husband and we do try to figure out how to dance in the rain.  So, thanks for that.  Hope this helps.",
