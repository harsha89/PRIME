I am meeting with breast surgeon next week to discuss her recommendation of an incisional open biopsy.  I have read that with this diagnosis an excisional open biopsy should be done.  maybe someone that has gone through this already can shed some light on why one is preferred over the other.  and which one you have gone through.  Also would like your input whether you have been told by your bs that this diagnosis of ALH is in fact pre-cancerous, and how does this increase my risk of developing bc?  thank you for your help and hoping to hear something before next week, so I am more prepared for my meeting with the surgeon.  Again, I wish everyone the best of luck!!!!  we will all conquer this together!!!!! ",

BUT I have the \"lowest pain threshold\" -- seriously. I don't even like the pain of tweezing a hair on an eyebrow. I told my radiologist I had a low threshold to ensure she used adequate lidocaine or whatever pain anesthetic they used. I had a 9 gauge (fairly big needed) core biopsy - and while I wouldn't say it was pleasant, it was even close to as bad as I imagined it would be. Not at all. In fact, I think the mammo tech squeezing my breasts into the machine at the start may have been almost more painful than the procedure itself. I was really surprised and relieved that the procedure was so tolerable. Afterwards, I made sure to use ice packs CONSTANTLY - So much so, I forgot I had them in my bra and there would be no more cold sensation, but as soon as I felt tenderness, I was like, \"oops - time to put in a new pack!\" -- I sleep on the left side and had the biopsy on the left breast so sleeping the first few nights was a little trying, but not much more than when I couldn't sleep after having a flu shot on that same side. So, overall, I know it's easy to say, and hard to do, but take a deep breath, and it WILL be ok. You WILL get through it - and hopefully, in 3 weeks when another poor soul reaches out expressing their concern, YOU can reassure them with truth and confidence, that they too will get through it, and that the pain you likely imagine is probably far worse than what the reality will be. Best of luck. Please update me after to tell how it went. And happy new year!",

But I am super confused at just HOW the pathologist can know whether or not the \"entire radial scar\" is contained among the 20 samples - or not - as in my case he stated on my report that, \"the radial scar is not entirely contained in the core biopsies\" -- how in the world can he (or she) possibly know? Esp since surgeon said radial scars are microscopic - is that not always true? How do I know if true for me, as she said?",

My Dr. said I will have a choice of general or (I think the other option was \"twilight?\") but the way she explained is this -- she said she goes in once and takes a chunk (circle?) with a loop out. She walks it on a board to pathology who decide if she got the whole scar and/or clean rims etc. -- if hopefully still benign, I have NO CLUE how pathologist determines if \"more\" needs to be take or if the \"entire scar is contained\" (if anyone on here understands the \"hows and whys\" better than me, please educate me?

WAITING, not knowing - , and fearing pain and outcome, I think I'd much rather be \"out cold and unaware\" - does this make sense?

Didn't know this - BUT if true, then doctors/radiologists are \"trading off\" the rights and well-being of women like me by saying, \"we know that women like this one will have to have surgery REGARDLESS of whether finding is benign or malignant\", but we are going to put them through an entirely useless and unnecessary procedure in the trade-off that a woman with a malignancy \"may\" have less surgery? And with the understanding (at least the understanding I currently believe) that any with a benign finding will have totally unnecessary biopsies? That's playing G-d. Some may reason, \"those with a benign finding in the end should be grateful and not mind that they had an \"extraneous biopsy\" - and while of course, any women with a final b9 diagnosis will be relieved, does that really excuse having put them through an unnecessary procedure? Does the means justify the ends? I don't believe so - especially when the \"ends\" can be achieved without the unnecessary invasive and painful procedure. If you are a train conductor, your job is to drive the train ON THE TRACKS, yes? One day, you see a couple on the tracks 1/4 mile a head -- if you turn suddenly, you can save their lives. HOWEVER, you also see if you turn (either direction) each side is One person that will be killed by your actions. Even in this scenario (which is not an exact analogy as I don't KNOW if more woman have benign or malignant radial scars accounting for their AD), but even in this scenario, can you say the conductor should deliberately kill one person by doing something outside of their job/process of staying on course/on the tracks in order to save 2? Wouldn't that be considered murder then? As opposed to \"an unintentional train accident?\" I am suggesting that the \"policy\" to do biopsies on woman in my circumstance is NOT the correct policy. Maybe my analogy is bad - but why don't we just do biopsies (or surgery) ON EVERY WOMAN every year - to detect cancer -- since we all know scans aren't 100% accurate. Most would find it an absurd \"concept\" to do that, yes? But why? How is that different?",

(I am in NJ). Anyway, to anwer you, I still don't understand what the term \"sterotactic\" means -- you said, \"mammo guided\" - right? Mine was Tomosynthesis-guided (I believe 3-D?) and was \"performed via a superior approach\" (what does that mean, please?? is that the direction in which she went in or something?) -- She used a 9 gauge Eviva vacuum-assisted biopsy probe and pathologist said there was 20 fragments ranging in size from .3 up to 3.5 cm, each measuring 0.2 cm in diameter. Does this sound like a large biopsy? Small one? Is it normal to have 12 core pieces turn into 20 \"fragments\"? Do biopsy pieces fall apart like that often?",

As opposed to what? Removing all at once? Why does the way they remove relate to their belief if benign or not? Does it change the accuracy of the pathology? Please explain. And hope you are doing well now. I am curious how your \"gut\" knew - but I guess that would be nearly impossible to explain to someone else, huh?",

So, first, beachtobeach, actually, just to clarify --- no offense intended at all - but to clarify, so, I had several 3-D tomo mammos, AND 3 Tesla machine top of the line (supposedly) MRI's And U/S over a 1-2 year period. The AD awas only seen on mammo. To explain. I somehow missed getting mammo in 2016 (I was really good up to that point), but had MRI in Dec of that year. MRI showed small abnormal \"dot\" finding, though the radiologist said it was too small to biopsy and he couldn't tell if lymph node or what, and to retest in about 6 months. Up to this point (age 53 - I had at least 10 mammos over the 13 years (I may have missed one or two - I KNOW I REGRETTABLY MISSED IN 2016 - Crucial in my case - because because benign with no AD t0 type 3 curve (near certain?) malignancy :-( BUT the radiologist just threw words on a page and I'm not even sure they realized they wrote this curve pattern which research and online \"Dr. Google\" said was a bad diagnosis. Anyway, I ended up having yet ANOTHER MRI with and without contrast in August of this year - also, benign with no sign of AD. Yet I had a Abnormal Mammo in March 2017 (again, with last one (benign) having been well over a year before) - and now I had an abnormal result - seemingly out of the blue - as U/S showed nothing. So, then I had another MRI about 8 months later this August. Back to back MRI's in under a year - showed nothing. So I \"distrusted\" the radiologist who found \"AD\" on mammo (because I had never heard of before, didn't understand, and really wasn't convinced what they saw was anything of import) and was floored when they ordered \"immediate\" biopsy! I sought a 2nd opinion to either concur or refute this need. At the time, I thought that was the prudent thing to do. Flash forward 10 months! I'll save anyone reading this the angst of the hell I went through for the past 10 months MERELY SEEKING A 2ND OPINION. Center that was well known turned out not to have a 3-D tomo machine and had trouble (understatement) opening/reading views. After about 3 or 4 weeks, obtaining new disks, etc. they said they \"think\" they viewed and weren't really certain they were seeing what the first radiologist saw, but didn't really seem sure they were truly viewing the 3D parts correctly\" - great, just great, I say sarcastically, as I let out a big sigh. They suggested, \"wait a few months and see\" - but not overly reassuring. :-(So I sought care at the NJ adjunct of Sloan Kettering thinking they were the \"name\" in Cancer detection/treatment, etc. In my case, nothing - N O T H I N G could be further from the truth. The surgeon I met with said \"she had no clue how to read scans\" (seriously? Breast surgeons aren't training in reading breast scans??!) and relied on her radiologist - who I discovered after 10 months of painstaking, waiting, calling, waiting for a SINGLE callback - that never ever came - not from either the surgeon or radiologist, seeking clarification - that they \"swept my case under the rug\" rather than acknowledge that although they DO HAVE A 3 D TOMO MACHING - they use GE - not Hologic and apparently and shockingly -- (and yes, likely sue-worthy and negligent), neither one of them apparently had either the skill level and/or the technology to view my 3D scans -- nor the humanity to acknowledge (since they never admitted, having opted to merely NEVER speak to the patient, me). I have since learned that my AD is mainly or soley on seen on the 3D portion and not on the 2D, I went through months and months of calling their receptionist and going through their patient advocates and FINALLY finding the \"doctors\" (and I use the term loosely) on social media where the radiologist did absurd amounts of self-promotion - including this insane twitter feed - and even had her own media page selling her so called \"expertise\" in everything from breasts to insects (??) to do talks, go on TV news shows (very scary indeed - Fox 5!) and so on. So, she apparently spent her time on anything BUT learning her craft or patient care. But I digress - sorry. Bottom line, I went for yet ANOTHER 3D mammo at a brand new center (local hospital) and they agreed they saw the distortion and said it may have increased slightly in this period (THAT made me nervous and very very angry at prior MSKCC doctors - who to this day never apologized, or called or anything - and to this day, STILL haven't read the various scans I brought to them - oh, but they DID manage to charge me many thousands of dollars for their so called \"services\".) As they say with \"services/friends like that, who needs enemies?\" I am still PRAYING for a B9 come and will forever beat myself up if delay in biopsy/follow-up turns out to have been detrimental -- but trust me, if it is - these doctors will have a malpractice suit (though ironically, I believe they are both married to lawyers, so likely don't care -- amazing, right??) But right now I just want to focus on my health. Even though I have hard 100% proof - that I was charged for reading of scans that were never fully read, my attorney said there has to be a \"bad\" outcome -- like you have to prove \"injury or that delay in care harmed\" before one can sue -- so it's perfectly legal to charge for health services never rendered?! :-( (let alone causing undue anxiety and hardship for 10 months?) It's hard to set aside my anger, and now, complete distrust of the system. But anyway, two 3D tomo's showed the AD -- and THEN the recent radiologist did a 2nd, but targeted U/S (despite script calling for complete bilateral one :( - and she \"discovered\" what she wrote to be a \"vague 7mm mass\" -- what the heck is a \"vague mass\" - do you see a mass or don't you? :-(( (A follow-up visit to breast surgeon with the U/S pics showed she didn't necessarily \"believe\" it was actually a mass and felt the radiologist who did the scan could have just as well have targeted other \"grayish, dark areas\" and that she merely was trying hard to \"locate \"something\" that would correlate to the AD she was seeing on my images - yet couldn't explain what it was. So I had yet ANOTHER U/S - this time I INSISTED it be done complete and the new radiologist (totally different imaging center) comes out and \"argues with me\" for the need to have the scan at all even though a REPUTABLE BREAST SURGEON ORDERED (Wtf?!!) So, I explain my 10 month ordeal, and this man is like, oh, ok - fine -- go ahead and have it -- the tech will do, BUT he says, regardless of scan, he is agreeing w recommendation of having the biopsy. Ok - fine, whatever - just do the scan! So the female tech (who I swear HAD to be on some sort of drugs -- she was very spacey - didn't even recognize her own unusual name when called it -- does the scan). Finally. Radiologist comes back out and I really, really wish I had a taped copy of our conversation - but he says my scan is completely clean. I clarify that there is no sign of a mass? He says, there is not. I'm happy but still skeptical and want to ensure I am understanding him correctly, so I say, \"There isn't anything? Not even a cyst? I usually have a zillion of those\". He tells me not even a cyst. Ok - so if you're still with me, fellow readers, AT THIS POINT I GIVE HIM THE PRIOR REPORT SAYING ABOUT THE \"VAGUE MASS\" for the first time - I had only given him the actual scan to compare - not the report. :-) I had deliberated \"temporarily withheld\" the report as I wanted an UNBIASED scan (ladies, that is nearly impossible to find) - but if there WERE a clear mass on prior scan, the 2nd radiologist should see, yes? Long story short - after he verbally assures me with no ambiguity whatsoever that I had an \"absolutely clean\" scan, his written report finally comes out and this guy puts it as \"Abnormal!!\" and looks like he literally plagiarized or nearly cut/copy the words of the vague hypoechoic (?) (doing from memory) mass\" - and he doesn't even write if he is referring to the right or left breast - so a shoddily and hastily written report (ladies, A REPORT SHOWING MASS SHOULD SAY WHICH BREAST IT HAD, YES?!!) - So after 10 months of horrific \"care\", I decide I need to be more proactive, so I physically go back to the imaging center and ask if I can please speak to the same radiologist who was there to merely \"clarify\" WHY HE DID A 360 Degree turn from \"completely clean scan\" to \"mass unchanged\" -- because, \"Mr. Radiologist\", either there was a mass seen by YOU or there wasn't. Obviously, I am hoping and praying it wasn't there after all. But I just want to discover the truth. WHY IS THAT SO HARD? IS THIS SCAN BUSINESS REALLY JUST A CRAPSHOOT OF THROWING ARROWS AND GETTING DIAGNOSIS/OPERATIONS ON COMPLETE CONJECTURE? Soooooo frustrating. I wish I could pay an outside source - any reputable radiologist - name your price - to do a complete comparison/outright reading of 3 mammos/3 MRI's and a few U/S -- but I couldn't find anyone like that anywhere in the country, let alone my own state. :-( Why are there not radiology groups that do nothing but, \"second opinion readings\"? Seems most doctors don't really have either the time or expertise to compare more than 2 scans -- if even that. (Yes, even cancer center at Rutgers University said they didn't have any such resource and didn't even have a suggestion of where I might look to find). I found one service in NYC but for $1000 or more, they said I'd only receive a written report after waiting weeks and there was no way/no process for me to ever speak to radiologist who did the reading should I have any need for clarification or questions about the report - which I find absurd and disconcerting. Nor nor could I confirm it would be read by a dedicated breast radiologist. I realize much of this may belong in another spot (moderators? Please feel free to repost or tell me how and where) -- but to any ears out there \"listening\" -- especially to beach2beach, thank you for allowing me to at least \"vent\". I could literally write a book about the horrific system I have been going through. Like this week, my dear spouse and I (he took off work) went to surgeon for consult prior to surgery BUT the center who did the biopsy literally outright lied to me - they SWORE they Fedexed my disc (as they wouldn't make for me while I waited) and they refused to give me the Tracking # - I asked for it several times -- and my SURGEON asked for it - and long story short, it was never sent, so the costly (costly in terms of money and times) was for nought, and now have to go back in 2 weeks. I made at least 10 HOURS of calls to the hospital - file room, admins, patient reps, more hospital admins, privacy medical officer, etc. -- and they all \"promised\" a call back and/or sending a cd - but they not ONE has called back. I was informed by my radiologist when she called to share biopsy result that they indeed LOST ALL MY 5-10 YEARS Of scans they had uploaded from my original disk - but now I am terrrified they may have also lost my day of biopsy - pre - during - and post scans and are not telling me. I have BEGGED each person I spoke to, to please be forthcoming with me (or at least with my surgeon?) about what the issue is - that they won't give me a diisk and won't return a single call -- and I get radio silence. So, the more I \"advocate\" and spin my wheels and reach out, the more embedded I get into this bureaucratic nightmare --- and I spend my nights awake - like now - slept 2 hours and got out of bed feeling anxious -- (and wrote this) as I all I want (and should be doing) is to focus on my health, but I can barely eat -- barely have time to even make an egg as spending all my time/energies on this health nightmare - made so much worse by mere incompetency and lack of care. (If anyone knows a reputable place in NJ (or even NJ, if need be) please let me know. Can't be too far from me though if place forces patients to go back in person to get their disks and won't mail. :-(( Thank you for listening.",

I am actually quite shocked and dismayed they didn't discuss with me that the outcome would almost certainly require surgery REGARDLESS of if biopsy was benign or malignant. They led me to believe one only went for surgery if malignant findings -- which is not true. But point of my post. Based on other member's posts, has ANYONE on here who had AD/suspected radial scar or malignancy EVER been told to just get excised, and completely skip biopsy for a first ever lesion? If so, please let me know - either publicly, or in pm. Thank you.",
