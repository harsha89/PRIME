      "Content": "Feb 22, 2013 03:09PM - edited Feb 22, 2013 03:16PM by svetik I did clinical trial between chemos. It was also targeted therapy for triple negative but different drug (Foretinib). I had only few weeks to enter so I went for it. I liked that I was closely monitored during the trial. They took me off the trial and put back on chemo as soon as the new treatment stopped working. There were almost no side effects on this trial, so it gave me a nice 3 months break. I know that there are women who stay on Foretinib much longer. All trials are different. Some have very strong even life-threatening side effects. It also depends on the phase of a trial. Phase I can be more risky than phase II because some side effects may be unknown.  I agree with Sheryl. Check if you can stop this trial and then start chemo if necessary. But I really hope that if you choose the trial (or chemo), it works for you.   Good luck! Lana",

My SIL however called me yesterday and said that only if I could ask God for forgiveness\u2026 I guess the ending to this sentence was supposed to be \u201cI would be healed\u201d. How evil does she think I am?

Maybe she felt lectured as I am usually the one who listens. This was probably my first time speaking up to her.",

I am glad that you are home though, feeling better, and thank you very much for telling us about your experience! BTW, although it is not nearly as dangerous as your story, when I went to one of these hospitals to install my port, all paper work said that it was port removal. I was lucky that a doctor figured it out before the surgery. He was mad too. Lana",
