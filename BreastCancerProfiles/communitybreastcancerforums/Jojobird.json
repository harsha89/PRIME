My husband and I would like to take our daughter to a theme park and possibly go on a few rides. I'm not interested in high-thrill roller coasters, but some \"easier\" ones, like a haunted house or water ride. Anyone have experience with this? I\"ll talk to my onc of course but was just wondering if this could increase LE risk. Thank you so much in advance.

Venus, Victoria's Secret. The brand names hither and yon. I had a mastectomy last year. My right breast was removed, amputated really, and now all that's left is something that looks a lot like some strange creature winking at me. Cue the close up gleam: *Ding*.So, you know the story, sisters. Here are all these bikini tops. Here they all are, overflowing on the pages, and we're one (or two) and down. There was never an easy way around my body - everyone's got issues, but a flattened, scarry-lined chest is a pretty big one. I'm forever asymmetrical. I'm a wink, a thub-dub, Droopy the dog with a stroke. I'm silicone and yarn stuffies, double-checking that nothing veers east or west. And every morning is a reminder, every day a slash/burn recovery as I yet again fit the falsie, settling it in like a necessary lie. I know: no one said it'd be easy, and of course I'm glad to be alive. But the change in my body is taking long to get used to, longer than I thought. The magazines don't help. I look and envy the full, symmetrical bodies, cancer-free and angled just so. I know it's photoshopped, I know the angles hide imperfections. But longing and grief are never rational, and here we are. I'm 48 and alive. If you're reading this you're alive too. Breasts are breasts: they're not *us*, they're not our selves, but they are/were part and parcel of our bodies and thus a loss. We have the right to mourn them. We also have the right to throw the catalogues in the recycling bin. You know what else? We also have the right to effing *swim.* My blog: pinkstinks.blog/ Dx 3/2016, IDC, Right, 6cm+, Stage IIIC, Grade 3, 21/21 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Surgery 4/18/2016 Lymph node removal: Underarm/Axillary; Mastectomy: Right Dx 4/2018, IDC, Right, 5cm, Stage IIB, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2- Chemotherapy 4/26/2018 Taxotere (docetaxel), Xeloda (capecitabine) Chemotherapy AC + T (Taxol) Radiation Therapy Whole-breast: Breast, Lymph nodes Log in to post a reply",

After discussions and phone calls and emails back and forth with my oncologist and surgeon, I have decided to have only my fallopian tubes removed. It reduces the risk of ovarian cancer but does not have the quality of life impact that ovarian removal does. I had NO IDEA this was even an option until about the fourth phone call with the surgeon, so it's a lesson for me in learning to ask questions and follow my gut. I can always have the ovaries removed later, but after menopause the impact on my heart and cognition will be less risky. Surgery's on Monday, and my fingers are crossed for a smooth recovery. Thank you all!",

My gene mutation, this replicating little tick, puts me at higher than average risk of ovarian cancer, and so now I must decide. The risks include heart and bone problems, plus a higher risk for cognitive decline. Ladies, I like my brain. I like thinking, I like reading and daydreaming and coherent sentences. Has anyone here had an oophorectomy? I am 49 and went through chemopause. How did it impact your life, moods, being? I am worried and am trying to weigh pros/cons.

Also, my family lives on another continent and the thought ofnot seeing them again due to restricted travel really makes me sad. How Do you cope?
