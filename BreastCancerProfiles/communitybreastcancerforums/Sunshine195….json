I hope that helps! Sunshine",

I would just hate to see you have to undergo such a harsh treatment that you don't really need to have.  Also--and this is just my personal opinion--I would rather deal with having no lymph nodes on that side rather than go through chemo. Thanks for your input, and I hope this all works out for you! God bless, Sunshine",

Since my oncologist was out of town, I got the \"relief' oncologist who was an absolute a**!!!  He strongly insinuated that I was just being \"over anxious\" and causing it myself.  Then he told me \"shortness of breath\" is one of the side effects of Neulasta (the shot I get the day after chemo).  I tried to explain to him that this is not what I'm saying...I am NOT \"short of breath\" just sitting there...it only happens when I lay on my side or back.  Anyway, he at least sent me for a chest X-ray and my lungs were clear which was good to know.  But I still don't have an answer as to what is causing this. Anyone?? Sunshine",
