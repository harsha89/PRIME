I live in Alabama, and have come to the conclusion it is surgeon based. My team of MD's here really push breast conservative surgery if you meet criteria, they say studies have shown that there is no significant difference in re-occurence for women who have lumpectomy w/ radiation vs. mastectomy. I still dont know my chemo status as of yet. But from reading other ladies articles on here, I see a lot of mastectomy.. I know my MD's base their decision on tumor size, breast size, type of cancer. I have had ultrasound guided bx twice, MRI, and too many mammo's to count! I had my lumpectomy on 15th, and found out earlier this week my sentinel node was negative (Praise the Lord!), but one of my margins were NOT clear, so I go back to surgeon Tues. to see what next plan is. I have also read of several who have lumpectomies with subsequent \"excisions\" for unclear margins. I would suggest talk at length to your surgeon, let your choice of surgeon be the one you feel most comfortable and confident with. Reading online will overwhelm you with so many various opinions /tx's! Also, I hope you have a hospital that deals with cancers.. larger hospitals probably have more access to recent trends in medicine, and remember they call it \"practicing medicine\" for a reason! I dont say that to scare you, but to point out you will get different opinions from different physicians, you have to go with who you trust and a decision that gives you peace.I prayed before making my decision, and have had peace, despite hearing of negative margins. I wish you all the best, keep me posted! Suzy",

Hope these are \"little\" rocks I get each  tx.     ; ) hindsfeet, I am so sorry to hear your report and my heart is burdened for you. Please know you are in my prayers and will be there continually. You just remember none of this has taken God by suprise, He is still on the throne, and He will carry you through. We just have to trust Him. I know I have had to remind myself numerous times that all God asks of us is to have faith of a mustard seed, and those are little seeds! But it is easier, we think, for us to worry and try to carry a load that truly only He can carry. One of my most comforting verses is Jeremiah 32:27.. \"Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?\"    Please keep us updated on you. hugs & prayers",

The Radation Therapist was super nice, explained things very thoroughly.. the nerd in me thought it all was quite cool... except for why I needed it!  It is quite amazing what technology we have and how far we have come in treating breast cancer, esp so specifically to each person's cancer characteristics. Wishing you all a wonderful weekend, reminder of Happy Breast Cancer Awareness Month to all you SURVIVORS!! I should hear back first of this next week when I actually start rads.. anticipate it will be by the end of this upcoming week. My two youngest children are out of school for fall break, and I told the Rad Ther I have Tues / Wed off from work and would really prefer to start after that so I can have couple days home with kids.  Have any of you that are near the end or have ended rads.. did you notice any further changes in the size of your affected breast from rad tx? I think my post op swelling has completely resolved now, and just curious if  she will change any more. Thanks for all input.",

So far everything is going just fine I think.  I find the radiation stuff cool, don't like why I need it, but fascinated learning about it. I don't have any scenery at mine either, but I am so busy watching that thing rotate over me and counting the clicks, I dont think I would notice if I did have scenery! Amazed at how quick the actual treatments go, as I understand, once a week I will get Xrays, and once a week I will see the RO, but on the other 3 days, I was in / out in about 15 minutes. Staff has been super nice. I have been using an aloe cream at night after shower, have Aquaphor on hand for if I need it, and my RO gave me a clear gel like lotion to use, but havent yet. My RO said no lotions / creams 4 hours before rads, no deo except recommmend \"Crystal\" which I found at Walgreens. It's a mineral block, you have to out a couple drops off water on it to rub it on.. neat.  On my weekend off from rads I used my regular deo, but I guess would leave that off then too if I develop any irritation. Whew what a journey this is.. it's hard to believe, looking back, how much has already happened since my diagnosis in August. To all the newbies, hang in there girls... it's  a wild ride, but definitely doable. I bet you find strength you didnt even know you possessed!  God bless you all~",

Do try to have someone go with you, doctors will go over a lot with you, and you will be overwhelmed, so another support person with pen and pad is helpful. If you havent already, you will probably have a biopsy to determine more about your cancer. There are many specific tests they can do to determine the best specific treatment for you and the type of cancer you have. Try not to fret about test results, it's not that they are necessarily good or bad, just they give the doctor data that will make your treatment very lynette specific! Try to not feel rushed also... you don't have to make immediate decisions... once all your test results are back, doctor will tell you what options you have, then you can take a little time to decide what you want to do. Most importantly remember that now that this has been found, treatment / healing are quickly coming! Many advancements have been made in breast cancer, and as I kept getting told by my medical team.. this is just a \"bump\" in the road...  Ask if your hospital has a Breast Navigator... a lot of larger hospitals do.. this is a nurse that kinda leads you through testing and treatment and is a resource for all of your questions. This site has a lot of wonderful info too.. and some amazing women who can support you ! You are not alone on this journey.  It is very overwhelming and I know I have felt like, and still do.. that this is the rollercoaster ride of my life. But you just take one day at a time and focus on what is the most pressing issue at the time. I tried to plan everything from the get go and you can't do that. If you still need biopsy.. then deal with that.  Then post biopsy results. Then surgery if needed.. or whatever.. one step one day at a time.  Praying for you , hope this helps.. keep us posted.

I know our doctors here really push breast conservation surgery if you qualify... once you get results read up on the info on this site that explains it better. Some cancers feed off our hormones, some are HER 2 positive, in which there is a specific med for that.. main thing is to just see what you have and what the treatment involves.. then take a deep breath and make your decisions. I will say that by looking on here, a lot of women with similiar diagnosis get different treatment, so don't let that concern you. There are so many variables, you just need to have good communication with your doctors and trust in them.  I just noticed you are in Clearwater.. what main hospital will you be using.
