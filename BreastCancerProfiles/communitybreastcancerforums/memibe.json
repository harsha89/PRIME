I've had a lump on my breast for 2 years now I was supposed to get it looked at but being 22 years old I didn't think much of it. At first it was hurting during my period but now it lasts much longer. Im not too sure if it's the same lump that grew or another one. I've gone from size 32C to a 32DDD within a year and a half. Mind you I had a baby and breastfed here and there for a month. Now I have arm, middle back, and rib pain. Just soreness on the right side of my body which is where the lump is located. On the bottom side of my nipple. I heard pain anywhere else is a big red alert for breast cancer :( if any of you had breast issues whatever the case may be please share Log in to post a reply",
