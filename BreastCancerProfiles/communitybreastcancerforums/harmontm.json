It is driving me crazy, and can be embarrassing at times when I am in public and I have to discreetly try to get enough friction with my shirt to relieve it until I can get to a private location.  I am hoping for some answers on Monday, or at least a plan to get some answers since I have never had any problems with my breasts in the past.  This is new for me, and I am so thankful there is this great site with wonderfully supportive women to listen, advise, and support each other. ",
