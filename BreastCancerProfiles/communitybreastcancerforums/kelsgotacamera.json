      "Content": "kelsgotacamera wrote: I am scheduled for a biopsy on 12/9.  I found the lump in April, had a mammogram and u/s and was told to wait and have it rechecked in 6 months.  I made the appt. to have it rechecked in early Nov. with a breast surgeon.  He found it odd that they put it off for that long with my family history....mom and both maternal aunts have had b/c.  This dr. did an ultrasound and found what could be cysts, but do not have smooth, defined edges and they also do not appear to be clear so we're having a biopsy.They are also hard and do not move....that I can tell. Here's my question. Is it asking too much if I call the dr. back and ask what he may have noted in my records from the u/s?  I would just like to know his wording, etc.  I would also like to know if he found them to be soft/hard, fixed/moveable. Also, the first dr. felt a little place in my opposite breast that this dr. also felt.  It did not show up on the u/s and he's not too concerned about it.  He asked if I wanted it biopsied also.  Should it be?  I feel assured if he felt it was necessary, he would have not given me the option and would just do it also. Sorry for being such a worry wart.  I just want the wait to be over and to have my answers. Thanks in advance for any help and advice Kelly Log in to post a reply",
