I opted to do breast conservation surgery to have the tumor removed followed by 40 radiation treatments. I did opt not to do chemotheray and I am so glad. I also opted not to do femera or tamoxifen. My breast care team at the hospital disagree with my PCP and think I should have the PASH mass removed. My PCP thinks I should wait. He feels I've already had too much radiation and like others have stated on this post - it could go away. He told me a very interesting fact which I'll share with you - each mammogram is equivilent to 20 X-Rays! Wow! Anyway, I'm wondering if there is anyone out there who has had a similar history of breast cancer and then developed PASH? I am a DES daughter and my mother who was also exposed to the drug developed breast cancer. I'm one of those women they consider high-risk so they don't want to take any chances. Would greatly appreciate any feedback anyone can give me.",
