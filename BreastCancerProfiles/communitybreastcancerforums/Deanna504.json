Just wanted to say that I'm so sorry about your news. I'm not sure how I would/will do it!  I'm already so angry!  There are so many advances in cancer care. Things are getting better every day. Wishing you love and wellness!",

I found a tiny lump, very near my chest/sternum/breast margin. Finally went to gyno, who sent me for mammogram. I sat there after, and they were like \"the doctor would like to see you.\" So, the doc did an ultrasound. The lump was very visible. Looked oval on the screen. I was thinking cyst. The doc says they'll have to do a biopsy. It will be a core needle biopsy, this Tuesday. I'm scared to death! Ultrasound report says,  \" there is an irregular, solid mass measuring 7mm seen in the posterior 3 o'clock region of the right breast. Findings correlate to the palpable abnormality in the posterior region of the r breast at 3'o clock. This could be a dermal finding, but I could not confirm that it is in the skin. BI RADS Catergory 4: suspicious abnormality.\" Does anyone know the significance of \"dermal finding\"? And how does the report look to you, as far as possibility that it's malignant vs benign? I'm out of my mind scared!! Edit Delete Log in to post a reply",
