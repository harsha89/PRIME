I am thinking it's not worth it to go under a GA considering the great risks of GA? Has anyone had a fat grafting done under a local anesthetic? Can it be done under local?",

      "Content": "Mar 28, 2018 02:49AM - edited Mar 28, 2018 02:55AM by SajeScents Can minor fat grafting after lumpectomies (yes, bilateral) be done under local anesthesia? I'm not looking for augmentation, just smoothing out the indentations, puckering and creases which developed after seromas drained and tissue healed in creases. Before the seromas, the surgical scars were smooth and tissue wasn't puckered, One breast looks like a hacky sack (like it's partly adhered to chest wall, yet doctor tells me it's not adhered)! I'd love to have it smoothed out, (I can live with the slight indentation and crease in the other boob), yet I don't relish undergoing a general anesthetic for medically unnecessary procedure for the hacky sack. Am I just being vain? Hubby says it's up to me, but I think he's just being \"sensitive\". I will see the surgeon in about 2 weeks for an initial consult. If it can't be done under a local, I'm wondering if I should simply cancel the consult. Anyone know? Thanks in advance,",
