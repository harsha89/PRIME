It is not fair that other countries are researching less barbaric methods to cancer treatments such as sound waves to kill cancer cells, or Chinese medicine, or essential oils, yet in our country it seems that we only maintain Cancer with the same methods that have been used for over 30 years strictly for profit. It is not right, and it's not fair. No one should have to go through cancer. With as long as cancer has been around and all the money that goes into the \"non-profit\" end, how are we not closer to a cure? Chemo, Mastectomy, and Radiation seem so barbaric, like blood letting with leeches in the 19th century. There has to be a better way. Sorry I an going on about this but I am going through the chemo part of my lovely breast cancer journey right now and it has not been easy. I went from an extremely healthy and active person to feeling like a 90 year old woman and when I see the Susan G. Komen commericals on TV it makes me want to scream.",
