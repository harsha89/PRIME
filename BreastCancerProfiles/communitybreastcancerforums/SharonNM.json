This group was highly recommended by both my oncologist and surgeon - I do think that once you feel like you have a good doc - they will only make recommendations to other good docs.  If you get two recommendations to the same doc - you probably have a winner.  Now I am looking forward to my first appt (probably simulation) tomorrow to see this eq.  Thanks for the info. I am probably more hung-up on technology then I should be.  I have this nagging feeling that I would have been diagnosed earlier if the radiology group I go to had digital mammography earlier.",

Anyway - haven't had much to report.  after treatment today I will be 13 down and 21 to go!  It has gotten pretty routine.  The staff at the radiation oncology center is great - very efficient and approachable.  Haven't had much skin reaction (mostly under my arm where my lymphectomy scar is).  I see an MD every week to assess my skin and health.  He is from MD Anderson and has said that they like to see some skin reaction as that assures them that they are treating all the tissue - including the skin.  So now I am a LITTLE concerned that I am not having a skin reaction as that sounds like it could be a good thing.  Anyway - with 21 more treatments to go - I am sure I won't get out of this without some reaction.....no need to crank up the radiation!! I am starting an AI after radiation - my oncologist has said that there are two theories on this and some docs start the AI's concurrent with radiation and some start after.  Her explanation was also related to side effects - and wanting to know what treatment is causing what side effects.  Anyway - I do look forward to this nice two day break on the weekends.  Have a nice weekend everyone!  And thanks for all the good tips and information.",
