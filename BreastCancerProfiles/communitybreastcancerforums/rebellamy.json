There are millions of words one can say to try and lift all of your spirits but I know that the only comfort my family and I have been able to receive has been from our savior Jesus Christ. I know for those of you who are not believers may say another one of those people, but I beg you look into who he is, dont keep sitting in your misery when there is so much to be offered to you, not in only healing but in companionship. He knows what you are feeling when you feel like no one understands, and your probably right they probably dont, but He does. Jesus walked as a humanÂ so that he can identify with us, to show us that he does indeed understand what are human emotion feel like. He offers so much love and understanding and it is vital that we get to know him especially in these times of heart aches. This walk of going through breast cancer is hard but with Jesus it is manageable, and through him there is no such thing as death if we only believe on His name and love him through our actions, we can spend an eternity with him............. Get to know him sisters.... He offers life, peace, and yes even in these times joy. Give him your heart he will cherish it. for he knows exactly how many tears we have cried. trust on him and you will never be put to shame.",
