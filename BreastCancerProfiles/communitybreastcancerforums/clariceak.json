I specifically asked my doctor not to talk about my prognosis, only my treatment. You must feel shellshocked right now.  Once you have a treatment plan in place, remember that the emotions you feel can be the result of the steroids given with chemo.  You may feel agitated, moody, tearful and anxious.  Steroids are powerful drugs and this may be a time to accept whatever anti-anxiety drugs may be offered to you. Find out what your onc says about Zometa to possibly help prevent reoccurence.  This is a bone strengthening drug that many of us are taking. \"Pure\" was treated by a cutting edge onc and she received it during chemo.  There will be some dark days, but you will get through this.  Be sure and read the Stage III 5 years out check in thread posted on the top.  You'll read the stories of many Stage III women who are doing well.   This is the best place to come for advice, and comfort.  All of us truly understand what you are going through.",

I had hives one week. My fingernails are starting to turn black, Afterh the 5th cycle I started noticing increased fatigue on day 3 and 4,  My wbc went down for the first time on cycle 7,  Did your onc explain why you're not receiving the weekly Taxol? I seem to remember you're having it every 3 weeks.",

I had learned about it through Susan Love's remarkable project, The Army of Women (AoW). I had a doctor's appointment anyway. It only involved drawing a few extra tablespoons of blood and a follow-up phone call. The researcher I spoke with said that AoW has made a huge difference in their ability to recruit enough subjects for their study. Across the board, she said, the participants have been eager to help. I had intended to do another clinical trial at the end of my treatment, but it didn't work. For that trial, I would take Metformin to prevent a recurrence. Because my tumors were hormone-receptor negative, I am not taking anything like Tamoxifen or Armidex to prevent recurrence. My chance of recurrence is around 20-30%. My oncologist had explained to me why they were prescribing the diabetes drug to breast cancer survivors.  They had done meta-analyses of survival and recurrence rates in breast cancer survivors. Metformin seemed to significantly lower recurrence rates when they looked at populational data, controlling for other factors like weight, age, and fitness. They thing it has to do with cortisol suppression. I ended up not being able to do the clinical trial because the Metformin shipment got held up in Canada. By the time it arrived, I was no longer qualified because of my date of diagnosis. My doctor offered to prescribe it to me for off-label use.\"",

I'm a newbie, but from what I understand sometimes chemo is used to shrink the tumor prior to surgery.  Mine was removed during an excisional biopsy and I will probably need more surgery in the future due to it's size.  I'm glad that they will begin discussing possible options with you so quickly.  You'll find that waiting is one the worst parts of this process.  Your fighting spirit will carry you far in this journey, and you will always find someone to listen to your worries on these boards.

I don't have a wonderful supportive husband like many of you, but at least my daughters are so close and loving that they can help each other. I also suffer from SAD, and according to the experts February is the worst month for us.  hang in there.",

Sometimes in reference to bone mets, it's been suggested that the pain be intense enough wake you up in the middle of the night. Some possible signs of liver mets could be twinges on the right side, changes in appetitite and digestion and curiously, pain in the right shoulder or collar bone area.  Coughs that linger or breathlessness on may indicate an x-ray is needed to rule out lung mets. Seizures or loss of function in one side of the body should be reported immediately. Almost everyone who has been dxed with cancer has had a scare. You are always welcome to come back to this board if an issue develops.  Wishing you and your mother the best.",

I think you are probably in the phase where the reality of your situation sinks in.  At first there is the shock of dx, then busily making plans for surgery and treatment and then weathering the initial chemo. At some point, as we learn more about cancer and the prognosis for our particular situation it can become overwhelming and quite frightening.  Some women have gained control by changing their exercise habits and diet.  I'm on zometa knowing that I am at high risk for jaw necrosis due to all the factors you mentioned.   I grasping for any sort of advantage over this disease and have put myself on meformin. I'm sorry the Taxol is hard on your body as well. I have heard some say that se's are sign that the chemo is working.  If you are on steroids during chemo they will wreak havoc with your emotions.  Please know this is temporary.  I begged my onc to lower my dose and she did.  I feel it is careless for the oncs not to warn of the very real emotional chaos steroids may cause.  They can contribute to feeling hopeless and take you to a very dark place.

My onc does bloodwork every six months which includes a tumor marker test.  I have no idea if it accurate for me, but if it climbs steadily up then we'll know a scan may be in order.  I suspect I'll be seeing her for the rest of my life.

Are you teaching this week?  I'm taking today off work before my appt. with the surgeon to look at my wound and then back to work tomorrow.  We just have a little more than a week to get through - we can do It!  I would really recommend not doing too much research before receiving the path report.  You might scare your self silly.  Strange expression, now that I written it.  All your normal aches and pains become more ominous, and you certainly don't need any more stress. Research has been done on women awaiting biopsy results and of course their stress levels go sky high which isn't the optimum place to be when beginning treatment.  It reminds a bit of right before childbirth when you have get up to go to the bathroom at night ensuring that you will not be well rested before one of the biggest events in life and ensuing sleep deprivation.",

Up until this point, I've been incredibly optimistic.  I had a bilat last week and sailed through the surgery.  Was up and walking around Seattle with my \"It's Pat\" from SNL chest within 2 days of the operation.  I felt ready to take whatever was thrown my way. I knew that they found an inoperable lymph node behind my breast bone which made me Stage III automatically. I also knew they had removed other nodes which were cancerous.  At my first meeting with my onc I told her I didn't want to discuss my path report, just the treatment plan.  She called my case \"challenging\" which didn't actually raise my spirits.  Onward to the post op with the breast surgeon. She asked if I wanted to see my path report, I gave her the same reply.  She gave me the paper copy to take to my doctor in the small town I live.  I was exhausted flying home on the plane, feeling weak and vunerable, and pulled that fracking report out of my bag.  One of my biggest mistakes.  I was immediately devasted, felt like I was punched in the gut, nauseaus and of course didn't sleep that night. Reading the report made me the feel the worst since I started this process. I have two young girls, 8 and 10, and finally saw them after 2 1/2 weeks.  Everytime I look at them I think of what lovely children they are and how I have let them down. It just breaks my heart.

Here's my standard advice for the newly diagnosed. Don't google.  The information on the internet is scary and outdated and don't reflect the latest treatments. As others have state, it may be helpful to take prescription drugs to relieve the anxiety you will feel during this very stressful time.  I refer to it as the \"cancer radio\" and it was always on during the first few months. I found anti-anxiety drugs helped break the cycle. There is a benefit to being Stage III.  Lower stage women wrestle with decisions on whether to have chemo, how much, or do radiation.  The treatment will be as aggressive as possible to stop cancer now.  It will be rough but you will make it through.",

I went in to talk with the surgeon and ended up having a biospy!  I'm not sure if I was in the hands of the most skilled surgeon.  I think I stopped counting after the 8th attempt to get a decent sample.  The nurse was pointing out possible samples - I'm not sure how good his vision was.I expect I will be quite sore because he prescribed Vicodin and typically they'll only prescribe Tylenol 3 for any type of outpatient procedure.  He gave me no reason to be optimistic.  He talked about how if he couldn't obtain a good sample for a needle biospy I could fly to Seattle or Anchorage or stay in my hometown.  At no point did he every say this could be benign. I talked to my younger sister who had b/c and she lives in Salinas, CA and works at CHOMP hospital in Monterey, so that may be an option for surgery.  I hate to be away from my kids but I also want to be around for the long term and I really feel like a skilled surgeon is a big part of that. After everyone has their biospies we can meet over on the Waiting for Diagnosis.  You may receive results before I do.  They said to expect at least week for the results to come back from Seattle. .Like you, doing a lot of thinking, and either way, this has changed my life forever. I will fight for every woman out there who is going through this.  This is wonderful to hear. Let's take this situation and make something positive.  Just a warning though, although I am essentially a positive person I also indulge in some black humor at times like this.  Big hugs for everyone.

After that I was called by the doctor who informed me I am scheduled for a biopsy next Monday.

I guess my question is how much can be determined from the mammo and u/s combination?  Last week the doctor mentioned that I would probably see the surgeon to see if the biopsy was necessary due to my risk factors.

My kids were only 11 and 7 when I was dxed. I'm now 3 three years out of treatment and although I think of cancer often, it is not with the same intensity.  I'm so grateful I have been here for my girls the last 3 years, but also sad that now my attitude toward them growing up has changed.  I don't want to rush them, but I'm also relieved at their growing independence.  My daughter is a dancer, and her young and quite clueless lyrical instructor decided that a dance dedicated to cancer, specifically chemo treatment, would be a great theme.  So my 14 year old was up on stage in a recital outfit with a scarf wrapped around her head.  I saw her almost start to lose it and my heart ached for her.  My kids aren't as young as yours, but I know we all want to spare our kids the pain of losing their mother or even the thought that it is possible. On a brighter note, making it to 3 years is a big accomplishment.  Don't give up on your dreams for a long life.  My aunt went through late stage breast cancer, followed by ovarian and she recently went on a solo trip to Italy at 82!",

Pinkoctober seems to push the idea that breast cancer is the most important cancer.  The sheer volume of marketing and pr devoted to breast cancer must be insulting to other cancer patients. I would love to see more research on why there are so many young women on these boards.  Something is wrong with our environment.  But that's not the type of research that gets funded.

Zoledronic acid (Zometa, Zol), routinely used in this subgroup of patients, inhibits bone resorption and has antitumor properties. It has also been reported to have an antiangiogenic effect. Methods: The study prospectively evaluated the levels of RANK, RANKL and OPG transcripts by real-time PCR in the peripheral blood of 49 consecutive patients with advanced breast, prostate or lung cancer (36, 7 and 6, respectively). Patients were eligible if they were at first diagnosis of bone metastases and if they had not previously undergone treatment with bisphosphonates. All patients received the standard Zol schedule of a 4-mg infusion every 28 days. Patients were monitored for about 12 months and blood samples were collected before the first infusion of Zol and every 4 months thereafter. Results: At least 3 blood samples were taken from all 49 patients (4 samples were taken from 29). Baseline RANK, RANKL and OPG median values were 78.3 (range 7.3-620.6), 319.1 (21.4-1884.4) and 1.52 (0.1-58.0), respectively. At 12 months RANKL median value had decreased by 22% with respect to baseline, whereas OPG median value had increased by about 96%. Consequently, the RANKL/OPG ratio decreased by 56% with respect to baseline. These differences, however, did not reach statistical significance, perhaps due to the small case series evaluated. Conversely, although RANK median values had increased by 36% at 8 months with respect to baseline, they had returned to near baseline values at 12 months. OPG, RANK and RANKL/OPG trends were significantly related. Conclusions: The present work is one of the few prospective studies to be carried out on circulating markers that are potentially correlated with bone metastases. It was observed that markers of the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway in the peripheral blood of bone metastasis patients were probably modulated by Zol treatment. Zoledronic acid would appear to decrease osteoclast activity both directly and also via RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway modulation. Further investigation of the biological results is warranted.  ",

I was in perimenopause before dx, then chemopause and Femara after treatment.  I then found article which stated that although you may be in menopause your estrogren levels will fall steadily over tim .  To create a dramatic drop an ooph is needed.  Please don't quote me and I didn't save the link so hopefully someone can come along with credible research. There are also many consequences for having an ovary removal, including increased risk of heart disease etc.  As a Stage 3C, I feel my most immediate threat was my bc so out they went.  Now I just wish I could have all the fat sucked out of my belly along with the stored estrogen!",

I can only do the treatment plan my onc recommends, change my diet, exercise and hope for the best. I know some people feel better knowing the details, but in my case, I will save my research for things like positive tips on how to manage chemo etc. ",

I did 4 rounds of AC and am currently half way done with 12 weeks of Taxol. Congrats on being on your last round of AC. I know everyone is different, but Taxol is a whole new world for me.  I can eat, exercise (went on a 3 hour hike up a mountain on Saturday) and my only significant s.e. so far was hives that have  since disappeared.  I have heard that the weekly Taxol is gentler than the other courses.  Has your onc explained why you won't be on the weekly dose? Stage III dx can be daunting, but as others have said, you can feel confident that you did everything possible as far as treatment.  In many ways, I would think it would more difficult to choose how much treatment you wanted.  One way I cope is to bookmark the positive threads, and there are quite a few.  I think it might have been Kerry who said early in my treatment, cancer doesn't know what stage it is.",
