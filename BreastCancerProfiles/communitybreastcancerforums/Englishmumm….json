The waiting IS horrific. Try to bear in mind that 80% of breast lumps are benign.I am not a medical professional so will not even begin to submise on the lumps.  I wish I could take your fear away, but the fact is it's scary, nothing anyone can say or do will take away that fear until the results absolve them, I understand that. Being told to have those proceedures done, you have every right to be scared and the only advice I can truly give you is: try to keep your mind busy.....shouldn't be too hard with 3 children (I have 3 too). Perhaps you have tried already, but ask them if they could squeeze you in somewhere or maybe call you on a cancellation? Impress upon them just how this is affecting you. In this day and age 2 weeks is really just too long. You really can't do anything until you know the results so there are no plans to be made right now.The mind always runs to the dark side but hang tight and try, try, try to not let it go there.  There are fantastic people here, very kind and very knowledgeable. They will embrace your questions and nurture your emotions. Whatever the outcome, you CAN do this. Stay strong. With kindest thoughts, English.",

Tiffany, for what my opinion is worth, I second Gully, I would do what you feel will give you the most comfort and security going forward...cold capping, freezing fingers, green juice, etc. whatever it takes to make you feel you are making a difference because it is quite possible it WILL make a difference  ... Personally, I think forging on with the wedding is the best thing to do, nothing like something major to look forward to, to spur you on - not just for you but for those in your support network too.

I am a little older than you at 41 but still classed as 'young' in the BC arena. I have/had no other existing conditions and also did not do chemo or rads. I had a paravertebral nerve block and onQ pain balls - they are the best. I was in so little pain after the nurses almost refused to believe me when I would say I was at a 2 on the pain scale. I am stubborn and did not want to take the Narcs (no prizes for being a 'hero' let me tell you!) but as it was when I got home, I took 1 Oxy and 1 Norco, after having nothing via IV in the hospital then decided to switch to extra strength Tylenol: 2 in the morning, 2 at night. I had no bruising and very little swelling (I think the arnica helped there). I was almost back to full duties (I stay home with my children, we homeschool :) so it was a little easier for me I think than many - I did not have a time crunch to get back to work. My hubby took 2 weeks off, but I was certainly glad to see him go back to work and get on with everything myself - although I could not shower for 2 weeks as I had my drains for that long and he was a super big help with all that stuff. I wasn't allowed to lift my arms above shoulder height for 6 weeks but all that stuff varies from surgeon to surgeon, don't be surprised if yours says something completely different. I just wore button up shirts with the tanks that the nurse navigator gave me (had little velcro pockets inside). I followed the same protocol as Angelina Jolie (bar the fact that I actually had Bilateral BC) - I am not a celebrity watcher but my hubby thought that she likely had the best care available and my surgeon and PS were both amenable to doing that. I did not read anything about Mastectomy prior to my op other than the medical versions, I did not want someone to sway my thinking with a bad experience, I gave myself only 1 possible outcome and it had to be a positive one. I know several people that had an infection after surgery (major Staph infections), it's a scary thought for sure but I just believed it wouldn't be me......I wasn't a candidate for DIEP or other forms of recon so implants were where it was at! You can see said protocol here http://pinklotusbreastcenter.com/breast-cancer-101... - scroll down to stage 4 & 5 and of course, check that your surgeon(s) are comfortable with you taking any/all of the supplements should you decide to do that. I did follow it to the T, and it was super smooth sailing all the way along, from my BMX through my exchange - the only hiccup (so, so small in the scheme of things) was that I was allergic to the scrub they used in my exchange and broke out in a hideous rash over my arms, chest and stomach. I came out of surgery almost the same size as I went in and when I did my exchange I ended up with 475cc anatomical implants which gives me a D cup - much bigger than I was previously (I am pretty small - 5'6\" and 115lbs). I did not tell very many friends or family about my surgery or diagnosis, and no one would ever guess by looking at me now. My new boobs look great! They feel alright too! Perfect, no - but they most definitely weren't before (especially not after Breastfeeding 3 babies back to back:) and I never expected perfection. I am not sure how much bigger you can go, as it is so individual, but the PS will cover all of that and then there is our very own 'Whippetmom' - who is dynamite in the implant/exchange information scope. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/44/topics... I had a great surgeon and a truly fabulous plastics guy - he really convinced me to go with the recon. if only for psychological reasons. I am glad he did as I know that it was the best route for me. I healed incredibly well after both surgeries. I know that having a BMX was the right decision for me so sure I was, that I had my surgery prior to the oncodx coming back and 16 days after my diagnosis. My oncologist told me yesterday, between my low oncodx score and the BMX my local recurrence risk is to 3 or 4% - whatever that really means, IDK - but my brain likes it for now. I try not to read the stories of recurrence, although it is hard not to. Like you, I wanted to avoid rads and chemo (if possible). My new boobs look great! They feel alright too! Perfect, no - but they most definitely weren't before (especially not after Breastfeeding 3 babies back to back:) and I never expected perfection. I am not sure how much bigger you can go,as it is so individual, but the PS will cover all of that and then there is our very own 'Whippetmom' - who is dynamite in the implant/exchange information scope. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/44/topics... There is also some information here on surgery and prevention of recurrence: My surgeon did this. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/73/topics... This is so scary, and you are so young but it is completely doable, you really can get through it. I am 8 months out and it seems distant even to me. What the future holds, I have no idea and no guarentee - but the truth is, I didn't before. I have been taking Tamoxifen since July, and so far, have no problems with that either. Sorry this is so long, I close in saying stay strong and know we are here for you, this community is here for you - on the good days, but more so on the bad days. Laura x ",

There are numerous threads in place for younger women (I was 41 still thought I was young:) https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/27 You found a great place here at BC.org, it also sounds like you have found a kind and empathetic surgeon and nothing is conclusive until the biopsy results are in. Just remember you are not alone, not in your thoughts or feelings or your fears, it is perfectly natural to feel afraid, cancer is scary: no matter your age or your situation.

Just be sure to get a good breast surgeon (mine was a woman not sure if that really matters except she relayed certain thoughts as they applied to her, as a woman). Discuss the incisions and scarring -same thing with the PS. Everyone on the same page, so important. My surgeon did a very fine incision, granted my mastectomies were nipple sparing so it is in the infra-mammary line but we discussed the alternatives just incase. She was very clear that she would make minimal scaring either way.You are your very best advocate, tell them what's important to you. My PS asked me lots of questions along those lines. He told me post mastectomy can be a very dark place but being open about expectations and concerns can alleviate some of those thoughts. As of now, he seems to be correct.Good Luck!",

If you are er+ your Dr will likely do an oncotypedx test which will give you a recurrence score. I found/find it really helpful to repeat affirmations and positive thoughts, I refuse to give cancer anymore precedence in my life than needed, it doesn't work all the time but we're getting there. Try to find something positive that you can 'use' in those moments, prayer, mediation, affirmation, a call to a friend or just cry, be angry, be scared, you have every right to be... then, get a hug from your mum or a close friend ....This is so hard, the beginning is the worst.

I was a small 34 b but am a 34d now, like I was before I had my children. Be sure your surgeon is super experienced (ask exactly how many they have done) and be sure to ask about the risk for necrosis, lots of surgeons seem to skip that also make sure they go over how everything will look afterwards; I don't want to scare you but it can be a little frightening when you see everything for the first time. If you have that option (not everyone does), I would say use it. Some surgeons use nipple delay technique but mine surgeon did it all in one go. My surgeon is part of an on going research study of NSMX, and told me that the chance of recurrence is NOT increased with NSMX but ask your surgeon about that to put your mind at ease.Also, if it has not been mentioned, ask about a paravertebral block and On-Q pain balls. Those things were fantastic! I was virtually pain free immediately after surgery and healed very quickly..... I did not have the need for narcotics which aids recovery no end. I also used a specific protocol to assist with healing which I totally believed helped me heal significantly faster than either my PS or BS had seen. PM me if you're interested. Without knowing you, I agree with your husband: and based on my own experience...nipple sparing is 'kinder' psychologically - I look down and still see 'my' breasts. Good Luck!

It is terrible to see someone you love go through that at any age, at any time. I am not someone who had the option for prophylactic measures, but for what it is worth, I am someone who has been diagnosed with bilateral BC with no known genetic mutations or family history and chose a bilateral MX - I personally would lean towards the surgery (no haters please, it is just my opinion and feelings). Hearing the words \"You have breast cancer,\" is mortifying, only to be compounded if you already have an insight to the path it can follow, which you do. I did not even really register that it was 'early stage' because in my anxious mind it didn't/doesn't matter - everyone here, on this forum, has read of a stage 1, grade 1, no nodes, chemo, rads and hormonal treatment patient with a stage IV recurrence, albeit rare, it *can* happen. If I had foresight (who doesn't wish that - but you sort of do in this scenario, somewhat.. with the family history?) I would have finished nursing my 3rd baby and had a double mastectomy - no ifs, ands or buts. I chose a MX as I did not want to go through the screening and the fear with every mammogram, I would not be able to put that out of my mind - for ME the loss of sensation in my breasts was a fair trade off for quelling that fear and I know I won't regret it, it was right for me and my mindset. It is purely psychosomatic; I know mastectomy doesn't completely eradicate the chance of breast cancer or a recurrence, but it lowers it as much as humanly possible (I was quoted 5-6% chance of recurrence within 10 years not sure what it would be for you but your surgeon could answer) As it was, I was 41 and now get to live the rest of my life, however long it is with that fear, those words ringing in my ears with every ache, pain or lump. There's something very significant about that, but nothing I can do to change it, so I will live in fear until I don't. I did not have chemo, or rads so I was 'lucky'; Tamoxifen is alright for me, but many suffer on that drug and who knows what it'll do to me down the road?I don't even think about it - I would love to not take the pills, I am just not that brave. I feel my road was easy in comparison to many other courageous people with BC, but you don't get to pick your road; the sort of BC that you get. I think that is a valid consideration in your circumstance. On another, more upbeat note, I was eligible for a nipple-sparing MX (NSBMX) - you should be too as you have no cancer. I had no problems with my MX - recovered fast, and I underwent my exchange last week with my new implants and I love them! They look great and feel a natural part of me after just 10 days. I even have sensations in my breasts but again, many don't and that is a true downside and needs to be considered. My BS and PS did a great job and I really happy with that side of things. My advice to you would be, if you chose the surgery route: make sure your surgeon is a breast surgeon also, if you decide to do a nipple sparing MX be sure your surgeon is very experienced with that operation as there is a 5-8% chance of losing your nipples. I am not a celebrity watcher or in favour of promoting anything but both my BS and PS said I have had extraordinary experience and my PS can not believe how well I healed in just a week: I followed (and my surgeons did too) Angelina Jolie's protocol which you can read here: http://pinklotusbreastcenter.com/breast-cancer-101... I did not have 2 separate operations with the NSBMX - it was done all in one go, but other than that, I followed everything else. Again, just my thoughts and feelings, things I have turned over in my head many times in the last 4 months: perhaps you could see your family history as a contrite 'gift' if you will; an opportunity to make a decision that could prevent development of an insidious disease; enabling you to outsmart it, out run it, as you believe it is when, not if. It is indeed an opportunity that your mum and many others did not get. It's so hard but good luck you will make the right choice for you. Sorry this was so long....Hugs.",

I am new to this myself but I am the other side of surgery. I did the same thing as you - diagnosed to surgery. I was diagnosed on May 22nd with Bilateral breast cancer - a bolt from the blue with no known risk factors, no family history (ever) and only 40 years old - well, almost 41. I was blown away....many factors will affect what will be decided as far as treatment goes, they'll know more when you get your results fully. Please take some deep breaths as hard as it seems, it really helps. I had a nipple sparing BMX on June 10, I had pretty small boobs and the PS and BS both felt that pyschologically, having BMX would have a better cosmetic result which they felt was important for younger women - I had already decided that, that was the route for me so I was pleased they concurred and swayed my hubby. Some people like to take their time before doing anything - getting 2nd opinions, researching alternative treatments etc. BC grows slow for the most part (or so I am told) so that is great, if time is what you need, but that did not work for me, I trusted the BS and the PS so I felt comfortable going forward. Once I make my mind up, I need to go on - sounds like you know your own mind. I had a paravertebral block (I highly recommend asking about that - it was amazing in terms of pain relief and recovery) and TE's with 250cc which was a complete surprise when I woke up  (I am thin, they did not think they would fill in surgery). I woke up the same size as I went under (breast feeding 3 children for combined 6 years takes it toll :). I am shocked at how quickly I have healed physically - I believe it was due to diet and vitamins, along with a positive outlook..... It was/is scary but I don't regret it - I am a no regrets person, it was definitely the way forward for me. I would be happy to chat more about the surgery or anything else if you wish? There is also a July surgery sisters forum (I used the June one as a lurker, only signed up yesterday :)https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/91/topic/832453?page=6#post_4428764 I completely understand about your world being turned upside down and inside out - I think it is the same for everyone on here, that is perfectly normal and even this early on, it DOES get better - some days are better than others, granted.  As far as never being the same again, somethings are exactly the same. I read a lot about a 'new normal' but as I said, I am fairly new to this too so I am waiting to see what mine is. But, I can tell you that I feel more positive, more resilient as each day passes: I realise that I am still me, and the constants in my life are of great comfort.  I have 3 young children and I am waiting on the BRCA test too - I hate to think I passed anything on to them; it all just seems so unfair (not that I am anyone special - it is unfair for everyone that gets this or another diagnosis), but once you have a treatment plan in place things settle a little, and I am sure that time does his part too. Allow yourself the range of emotions you will feel, you are entitiled to them all.  I have been keeping a diary too, something I have not done for many years, it seems to help me a lot, writing things down.....   Extending a virtual hand, to hold or squeeze.

They are both great articles, particularly the second. I have my annual appointments set including baseline line US as guide for Tamoxifen induced changes, and was given more or less the exact schedule : every 3 mths for 2 years, every 6 mths through year 5, annual follow ups through year 10. Again, really appreciate your measured response. Wishing you a lovely Wednesday.",

My right side lump was 2.2cm and a grade 2 but I just confirmed Thursday that chemo won't be appropriate for me, even though I am young (41) - just Tamoxifen.. albeit for 10 yrs. I am small too so I understand your chemo fear, I had that too, but trust in yourself, your God if you believe, and your Dr's, ask questions - you can make it through, you are strong. I am almost a month out from surgery and am back to running on the eliptical, cooking, light cleaning, and homeschooling my 3 children - things I could not imagine doing ever again 4 weeks ago. Now life seems more calm, more normal, there is a plan/formula in place and I can function, I have to... I still have moments of being overwhelmed or the fear of my mortality shows its ugly head, but they are easier to contend with, even though I know it will never be the same again. All of the emotions and feelings you describe above are likely felt by everyone on here.  I hope you got your dinners done and put up and it is wonderful that your son is going to be there with you. One day at a time is good advice. I want to wish you good luck with surgery: I hope you read up on some of boards for tips (such as taking a stool softener, buying a wedge pillow and having button up blouses etc.). I also took 2000mg of Vit C and a good quality multi Vit with Iron and I have really healed well. I felt a sense of relief after my surgery, feeling that they got it all out (I know the reality but I 'choose' that belief). Keep thinking positive, in my very humble opinion, mind over matter is a major component in the healing process not just for the phsyical, but the mental too. I use guided visualization as that works for me, but others use prayer, all types of meditation and yet others need nothing but the love and strength they draw from their families and friends, from what I see there is no right or wrong way to deal with this. I shall be thinking of you. Love, light and blessings, please keep us updated on your progress. Hugs, Laura x  ",

I was well impressed and very thankful....Be kind to you, don't be afraid be a little vunerable, it is a chance for those around you to show how deeply they love you. You could very well be amazed at what you see or new good 'habits' that form.....Not saying that I wasn't happy to see my hubby off to work after 2 weeks - which, I'll be honest was a little long...I needed my routine back to function and heal. As regards to your beautiful hair: Cutting it and saving it with your other sacred items seems fitting - I would not profess to know very much about the Native American Culture and traditions. Acceptable to say you are mourning the life you had and when your hair grows back it can be a celebration of your new life? I hope your butterflies fly away - You are a warrior, you will prevail. I am thinking of you. Blessings and light for you and your family.",
