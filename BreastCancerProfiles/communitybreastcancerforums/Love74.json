The chemicals in the dye could break and damage the hair. And when you dye it the first time make sure its not hi lites or bleaching to a blond colour because that chemical is apparently too strong for six months...I was told that lightening should wait til hair is 1.5\". But everybody has different texture hair right? Im sure there are exceptions to the rule...and semi-permanents too.",
