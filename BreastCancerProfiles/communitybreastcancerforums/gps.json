      "Content": "gps wrote: My mother was diagnosed with metastatic spinal cord compression in mid septmeber 2011. After the cord decompression surgery, she is on letrzole + zoledronate as she is ER+. She also underwent radiation therapy for a part in the spine [D3]. At that time, bone scans had revealed extensive skeletal mets The oncologist asked us to follow-up after 3 months. Question : What should I expect in this visit? I assume he will test the efficacy of the hormone therapy. I suppose they will do bone scans or spine MRI [it was the spine MRI that revealed the problem in September] In your follow-up visits, does your oncologist run tests to see if it is spreading to other areas like lung, liver etc? Do they do any biopsies as well? [As the receptor status can change over time] Typically, how frequently do people meet their oncologist? Thanks. PS: To moderators: Not sure whether I had to post this in the hormone therapy forum or in the metastatic forum. Log in to post a reply",

I dont have much to add, but like some one else mentioned, bone scans can show hotspots for non-cancer related stuff as well. for example, for my mom, our orthopedic surgeon said the spots at the knee were definitely related to arthritis. good luck",

My mom was also diagnosed straight away with stage 4 with mets to bones (including spinal cord compression) in Sep this year. The oncologist here in India has put her on letrozole (hormone therapy). I asked him about whether we need more aggressive treatment and he referred me to the US Govt Cancer site http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/breast/healthprofessional/page7#Section_211 So, it appears that hormone therapy is the starting point as long as the metastases have not spread to liver lungs etc. Good luck. ",

(in general, for a cancer drug, do you take the branded version or the generic?) If you take the generic letrozle, which company manufactures it (and in which country?) Are there people who mix these two i.e. take Femara one day, generic Letrzole next day and so on? (to cut costs) Thanks. PS: Sorry for posting this on both hormone-therapy and the metastatic forums.
