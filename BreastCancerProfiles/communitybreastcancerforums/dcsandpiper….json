I sooooo know what you mean by time and effort and sacrifices for a nice guy, who's nice enough, but you're not IN LOVE with.  When you do find that right guy (like I most recently at 50 was lucky - knock on wood, hope it lasts - found), it will NOT feel like so much hard work and effort to be with him.  It will be fun, and warm and loving, and it will feel so good to have this person in your life and see him every day.  Other guys drove me crazy when they wanted to see me every day... I felt so crowded in on.  And so relieved after I broke up with them and got back to my happy enough single life.  And who knows, I might be back there one day. But just to say, that if you don't feel like its fun (not perfect, I said, no one is perfect), and easy and good to you, then you shouldn't be hanging in there. So, enjoy being on your own, running your own life and making your own decisions for yourself.  And who knows? Just when you think you're headed for life on your own, you might find someone who it just feels right to be with. Good luck and stay strong!",

It kind of mimics the look of hair.  They are thin and very comfortable. I ordered the women's slim fit, but I think I should have ordered regular. Flipping it into a hat makes it too tight to fit on my head (with hair, might be different after the hair falls out) Good luck! BTW, how do you upload a photo?

Mine was $350 and I felt so guilty about that since its not even real hair, but it does look great and will be easy to take care of. Glad to hear others have paid that much! Walking:  Thanks for the tip! My dog is back and I'm planning lots of walks today. Mouthsores: I've been swishing and gargling a couple times a day with the baking soda and salt formula.  It really helps relieve and I think it might help be preventative too.  The literature says that chemo kills fast growing cells. And those that line are mouth are fast growing. So they're not growing enough and I guess it is more unprotected or raw than normal. TC1 vs. TC2-4: I understand that the effects are cumulative... it is supposed to get worse (tired, more easily susceptible to viruses, mouth sores, etc)... not sure if that applies to the flu symptoms Nausea: I only felt nauseous (sp?) once. I took some prochlorper 10 mg and that took care of it right away. It is also supposed to make you drowsy (rather than get constipated, which was the other medication of choice) but I didn't feel drowsy. It just worked. Feeling better today and food actually tasted good this morning (trader joe's raison bran (+ TJ almonds) and tea with milk!) :-)  Hoping this is a sign things will be better now until the next infusions. Hope you are all doing well/better! Sandra",

It's a good thing I just got my buffs on the mail yesterday! They are so comfy! Thanks for the tip on that one! But I recommend to folks not to get women's slim fit I think they are a bit tight. Though I have a lot of hair so maybe they won't be without a thick head of hair to cover. It's still a bit of a shock. I have so much thick hair I wonder if I should wait a day or two or just shave it off now. My wig place said I could go back there and they would do it and also trim my wig and show me how to style it etc. I hope the wig is comfortable to wear... It looks really nice. Maybe I'll put a pic up there on the styrofoam head. It's very hard to wear while I do have my hair. Maybe I'll make it a mother daughter thing and have mom come with me to the wig salon. Oh, and yesterday I realized I could tie my own darn turban... Didn't need to go out and buy them... I have lots of scarfs. As long as you have a scarf that is cotton and longer than wide rather than the square ones, you can just wrap it around your head twice, tie in the back, and it looks pretty good. Sheesh, just in time for Christmas! Oh well, I feel I am all prepared with various head coverings. And my DB (dear boyfriend) has been great about it all - he doesn't care and is thinking of getting a buzz cut in solidarity. Of course he's an ex Navy guy so that's not to new for him... But it's the thought that counts! And he loves the different head coverings I've collected. :-) More later.....",

When I went to get a second opinion from a well regarded radiologist and she said I didn't need radiation I was thrilled. For people with mastectomy and who have had lymph nodes removed rdiationcanhave aloof really bad long term effect. Like capsular contracture, lymphodema chances are increased, and there are potential impacts to organs. So she said if I had radiation, it would maybe reduce my chances of recurrence from 8% to 5%. And that's based on older data when treatment overall wasn't so effective. Finally, she said the two biggest risk factors are: 1) rumors larger than 5cm, 2) four or more lymph nodes involved. I did not have these. Then there are six minor risk factors: 1) lymph nodes involved, 2) lymphovascular invasion, 3) grade 3, 4) positive margins, 5) younger than 40, 6) progesterone negative, estrogen neg or HER2 positive. I only had 2 of these six. And she said that want worth the risk and we could monitor closely. Talk to your radiologist about the risks and weigh them out.",

I've found that gatorade is a great way to stay hydrated. It tastes alot better than water, it has electrolytes or whatever, some of them are not that sweet - I like the watermelon/strawberry one or watermelon something.  Also some foods that I've found to taste OK during chemo: oranges, steamed veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts) with some butter salt and pepper, pasta with butter sounds good!, mild soups with beans (slow cookers!), baked potato, poached salmon with soy sauce and balsamic vinegar - microwave is easy way to do this, apples, pomegranates (just slice open - watch out for squirting juice - cut in large sections, bend it back and grab a bunch of the seeds, just know that you can't swallow them, you have to spit out the part that is not juicy, but it is very yummy and refreshing), grapefruit juice with tonic water if you are allowed to have grapefruit, sparkling water in general tastes better than regular water... berry smoothies with powdered greens and powdered protein if you can't get enough greens and proteins in, whole wheat toast, fresh medjool dates, irish oatmeal with almond milk (you can add dates, nuts, fresh apples)... Hope some of these suggestions help getting through those bad tastebud days, when only ice cream and cookies seem to be the only tasty things around! Good luck all!",

Mine was very nice, the nurses super friendly, and it is a calm place. Makes a lot of difference and you should not be feeling uncomfortable there. Went wig shopping this weekend too and found one I like! No bad hair days ahead at least during chemo! :-). Got a couple cute hats to so I'm good to go. Just wish my mouth and stomach felt better. I just feel like my stomach is not working properly. ugh. Liquids don't taste the same. Water tastes horrible. Soda water is better. Do you really think the hair loss will start after just a couple weeks? They told me it would be likely after the 2nd treatment. I'm hoping to stay productive work wise... We'll see. Started feeling tired today and having trouble sleeping with all that muscle achiness. Sigh. Hope it doesn't get worse. Great to have you all to blithering on to, though I think it's time to stop. I'm scared but I'm hoping all this treatment will do the trick! I'm not looking forward to feeling like this or worse for 3 months...

Not a very good houseguest - I feel horrible and hope she recovers soon as she is also preparing for a new series of chemo (colon cancer). Flu passed quickly for me, so I hope it does for her. Now all is well and still feeling pretty good. Got the head shaved yesterday! My hairdresser did it free of charge and even gave me a ride home! I was the last customer. Such a nice guy. I'm looking forward to going back to try short cute cuts when my hair starts growing back. I was looking forward to the Sinead O'Conner look, but I still have a few stubborn black fuzzy bits that the electric razor couldn't handle. So I guess I'll have to wait a bit for that clean look. Wish I could have had a few weeks of the pixie cut! That sounds great whoever posted about that. So far SEs have been manageable. Even infusion days are not bad. My friend came with me we brought sandwiches and watched a movie on the iPad. I have this double connector thing that allows two head phones to be plugged in. Very handy device! Stay strong girls!

They have a hard time drawing even a tiny bit of blood now. The nurses tell me that your veins develop internal scarring and that it never goes away.  Sheesh.  Wish I had known that earlier. May have opted for a port. Oh well, not too big a deal I suppose in the big picture if cancer doesn't come back. BTW, I've been told to do lymphatic massage on my right arm where 15 nodes were removed. Has anyone else been given that advice? Runner Girl - the resort sounds great! Protect your head!!! Oh and I have fuzz on my head, would prefer it to be smooth and shiny, but oh well. No other area where I've lost hair except the privates. Isn't that bizarre? I'm hoping that means it will grow back quickly.  I'm going to try a super short cut, like some of those movie stars out there... I like having not much hair! I hope you all are doing OK and not having too many bad SE's this week.  Only one more to go for me, then we can continue with the saline injections and switch out with real implants. Can't wait to get rid of what feels like scaffolding and canon balls in my boobs! Best to all!",

As a result they are going to put a PICC line in for the last one, TC4. Anyone had phlebitis? How long does it last? Is warm oppress the only thing you can do to prevent it? Does a PICC line hurt?",
