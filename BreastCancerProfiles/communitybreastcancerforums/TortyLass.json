I begin 4x of cytoxan and taxotere myself the week of January 19th and share your anxiety about how it will go. My oncologist was really supportive and optimistic about how I would feel. Of course, we wont know for sure until we start, but she helped me by reminding me that being proactive about hydration, meds, rest and nutrition (protein especially) is a critical to feeling as well as possible. Blessings!!",
