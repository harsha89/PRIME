It really feels good to know there are people out there who understand what I am going through.  Sometimes it is just difficult and frustrating to have to explain to family and friends (that have not had cancer) the complex emotions that I am feeling. That is why oftentimes I choose to just be quiet and not talk about it.    Thank you Judie and Maureen for the encouraging words. I will try not to stress some more and just try to live and  enjoy my life in the present.  It is, after all, the only moment we have.  God bless your heart, Ladies.  I shall update you when i get the chance ..taking care of a toddler occupies 90% of my time.  :)  Kaye",

I am Filipino but is currently staying here in California with my husband and my 33 month old daughter.  My immigrant status is still being worked on so I am still using a tourist visa. My family are all back in the Philippines so I am practically alone here. My husband's family is in Pennsylvania where he is originally from. I barely know anyone in our area and we have two friends that live within 10 miles radius, which we very rarely see.  My life here revolves around taking care of the household and my daughter. I have no social life and no job.   Ten days ago, I had to ask my husband to take me to the ER because I haven't been feeling well. I had low grade fever and my sides and lower back hurt. Turned out after some lab work and abdominal CAT scan that I don't have appendix problems but instead a bladder infection (UTI).  HOWEVER, the bad news is that the scan also showed multiple lesions on my liver and my eleventh rib. I managed to thank the ER doctor and offer a feeble smile but my husband was simply devastated.  I feel so bad for him.  I tried to put on a brave face for both of us but when I saw my daughter, the bitter reality sunk in.She is just way too young to have a sick mother.  The shock has somewhat subsided now  after sharing the news to both our families but the bigger challenge ahead of us is how to get treatment here. My husband has been calling Cancer Centers in Irvine and San Diego to get more information on how we could see/find a Doctor to look into my case. We have  been researching for some charitable institution that could also help with the treatment cost.  My husband has an insurance from his job but he couldn't add me into the policy until I have my SSN (which i could only get once my immigrant status has been established). I do not know how things work around here since all my treatments (surgery, chemo, rads) were done back in Manila. We are so at a loss right now. I have been feeling down lately and I fear that my immune system might be compromised with too much thinking.  I am tired all the time.  We don't know where to start. So, I am writing here hoping I could get any bit of information or direction. Your stories here give me inspiration.   Any help would be very much appreciated.  Thank you for taking the time to read my story. God bless your hearts. - Kaye Log in to post a reply",
