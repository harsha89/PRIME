After my treatments I started having dry eye problems, bad enough to warrant drain plugs in the eyes.  The allergy symptoms started immediately with the beginning of Navelbine, runny nose and teary eyes. The eyes were tearing but it is actually a dry eye issue ( funny), corneas scratched, using 3 different  script drops a day besides tear drops.  Got worse on Xeloda and finally now on Taxotere we have decided it is a no win battle.  The plugs will stay in my eyes, I use Lacrisert 1X a  day and Thera tears as needed. The teary eyes are not gone but 80% better than the constant crying.  The runny nose continues but has become manageable,  I take an allergy med once a day, use Fluticasone prop once a day, keep nose clear of debris  and moist with saline sprays and  sometimes old fashioned Vaseline when the inside gets dry or sore.  It has become more manageable for me. I find the worst times are during any exertion, lifting, bending etc.  I know that exercise is considered a natural antihistamine, during chemo I guess the  antihistimine effect is magnetized. My  honey had similar issues (not on chemo)  Doctor told him they can plug his turbinates(?) and that would stop the constant running.  I may ask an ENT about that one.",

After draining the fluid to give me relieve the tests showed cancer cells in the fluid.  Then additional tests showed the bone mets. So far I have had the lungs drained twice since the end of November.  I was on oxygen for a while but off now. The x rays still show the effusions but since starting Taxotere I have had  very little breathing difficulties, only on extreme exertion. If they don't subside I may have them drained again, but for now my lungs have compensated I guess.  I want to do 3.5  mile Breast Cancer walk in October. I am being told I can still increase my lung capacity the way any one else would. So I am going to start walking this week and  do additional breathing exercises. As for the talc actually killing the cells, I spoke to my lung and onc doc's, they have never heard of that. The said it just attaches the Pleura to the lungs, so there is no place for the fluid to buildup. I am waiting on that one because I have two family members who had it done for other reasons and they both had to have it done again. Even the slightest area that does not attach can allow for buildup.  I sympathize with the breathing discomfort, that was scary for me. Wishing away any discouragement, sadness for all Liz",

I was handling it all okay until the day I saw the first clumps come out and then I just lost it. I have perfectly straight hair, I loved my color, dirty blonde with all natural highlights. In the summer it would be sand blonde. Never colored or permed it. Tried the wigs the first time around and I hated them, just was not comfortable wearing them. Fortunatly  I have a very nice shaped head with no scars and bumps. Left it that way. I did love the curly that came in for a year when it regrew. This time around it thinned from my first two treatments of Navelbine and Xeloda and now after my first 3 weeks of Taxetere it is falling out quickly.  Considered the cold caps but too much work, I have enough to worry about. So bald I will be before the weekend I am sure. Lots of long cheerful earrings, scarfs and occasional turbans ( give me that Elizabeth Taylor look). May even take a ride to the beach and cover my scalp in  henna designs (that will raise the eyebrows of the bosses). This may sound crazy but this is the only time I am comfortable playing with weird colors and scarfs, crazy earrings and anything else affecting my scalp and hair and look. Gotta have some fun! ",
