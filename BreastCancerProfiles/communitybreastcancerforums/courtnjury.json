Had chemo and rads and lumpectomy last year, was doing good on Arimidex then it stopped working. So this year started off with rads to the spine and starting chemo again on Friday, then I will be starting another inhibitor. Hoping this year we find the right combo:-)",

Surgery was easy, I don't remember either surgeries I think they called it twilight. Was out if hospital about a hour or so after surgery. My T7 was pretty bad so didn't get much relief in that area but my L5 area there was a lot of relief pretty much right away. I only had a couple small incisions my husband says they looked like a plus sign about a half inch each. I guess it takes a couple weeks for those areas to heal. Hope I never need it again but would do it again if needed",
