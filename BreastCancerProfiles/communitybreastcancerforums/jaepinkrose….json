(It dropped below 0 last night & was about 8 degrees at walk time (1:30pm).  Time to get out my winter boots & wear gloves.  I also got a copy of deb's blood work numbers.   She is due for a week off next week but I wanted to make sure things were not getting too low.  I have not kept up on these things as much as I probably should since when I scanned the numbers a curious number jumped out at me.  I never knew that they actually rated \"BUN\"(s?).  This begs the question. How do you improve your \"BUN\"(s?)/\"CREAT\"(ive?) ratio???????????  Is this a dance move?   Oh well, I'll just keep walking.......as Deb alway says, John's Ignorance is Bliss.    Also, Deb's appetite came back the last couple of days. She's been eating very well.   This afternoon, she had just finished her lunch. A sandwich, milk, her favorite chips, fresh veggies, and some orange slices....Well rounded I thought.  I then gave her some more chocolate milk & went into the other room to change the laundry.  I came back a minute later & she had one chipmunk cheek.  A week or so ago she was not swallowing without being told so I naturally told her to swallow.   She refused!  So I told her to open her mouth & there was the plastic lid to the milk jug. I paniced & got her to spit it out.  Naturally,  I gave her more to eat!   All in all though,  I think it's a great sign!  Blessings to all & Thanks again for the Prayers & Well Wishes!

      "Content": "Nov 15, 2007 11:30AM - edited Nov 15, 2007 11:33AM by jaepinkroses Bimmer and Diane, I'm very sorry you're having to deal with such severe pain.  I read where you said \"I explained that they screw with you every 30 minutes day and night in the hospital and that being in the hospital is a fate worse than death itself. Then I told her how Diane wants to die at home in her own bed, with her family around her, and not in a hospital.\" and it really touched me, because that is also what we feared about my sister ending up in the hospital.  Not all hospitals are like that. I know your situation may not quite be to the same point that my sister's was, but having recently been through my sister's hospitalization at the end of her life (Oct 20-27, 2007), I think that your \"fate\" largely depends on the individual, which hospital, its staff and maybe how proactive your family is.   At my hometown hospital, from her entry to the emergency room ...to the very last day...every single nurse and doctor were gentle, caring, and strove to keep her as comfortable and pain free as possible. My mom, dad, daughter and myself were with my sister mostly around the clock for 6 days and saw every nurse and doctor.  They maintained excellent care with as little disturbance as they could, explained every procedure - to her and to us, were responsive when we  asked questions or made suggestions, and since we had at least two family members sitting right with her 24/7, towards the end of things, other than checking her every two hours or so during the day and about three times quietly during the night, they mostly allowed us to just call them when we needed them.  And when we called, we had immediate response every time via a walkie-talkie type device and never had to wait more than 1 or 2 minutes before we saw a human. We had a fold out sofa in the room that made into a bed for our use at night, as well as a recliner chair that would lay flat. Her original plan was also to die at home, but as things turned out I don't think we could have kept her as pain free or comfortable that way and we were not restricted in who could be with her at any time day or night at the hospital.  (We actually had so many family members come during the day the first few days, that the hospital offered to move her to a larger room to accomodate us, but we declined and I will admit I've never heard of any hospital doing that before).  In a horrid situation, at least for her, being in the hospital was not an issue that made things worse. My point is, she was as painfree as possible and surrounded by her family even though at a hospital and we as her family, were supported by the hospital staffs expertise at all hours of the day and night. This is of course a personal decision, and I don't know where you are located, or what your hospital choices are, but I hope you won't completely rule out the option of a hospital if Dianes pain gets really severe again at home.  Looking back now, it was a good solution for my sister and our family. Gentle hugs to you both.  judy",

BC still \"only\" found in liver.  Chemo is hitting her even harder now than before the break.  And her onc hasn't come up with a \"next\" option yet in case Taxol/Carboplatin/Avastin stops working (as all the others eventually did) - he's researching and he's been great, but says she's tried most everything he knows to try that might work. She's also been told she's not a good candidate for RFA or Chemoemobilization because of the number and position of her tumors. (she would feel so much better just knowing there is a next waiting in the wings as I'm sure you can imagine) If anyone can suggest something to try next, please post it or PM me.  Her onc is actively looking for something and is open to suggestions.  Thanks to you all.  judy",

(need to be sure the cards match whatever phone system is being used where he is, as it can vary).  The Marine Corps also has a system called Motomail, where we could register for free at a website, then were able to send email to his specific \"address\" and the message would be printed in Iraq at the base nearest him and was usually delivered to him as regular written mail within 24 to 36 hours.  I don't know if the other branches of the service have something similar to that but it might be something to ask him about. The website (http://www.motomail.org/) does say that Navy,Army & Air force personnel co-located with Marines are eligible to receive motomail too.  We could send up to two messages a day that way if we wanted and it was great for keeping him updated and in touch with things at home, was much faster than regular mail, free, and allowed us to condense things during the quick phone calls he would make, since he would already know most of what was going on at home.  We also sent care packages to him via his domestic military address and I got really good at packing a lot of heavy stuff into those small flat rate boxes you can get from the post office (no charge for the box till you mail it and they now cost $8.95 no matter what they weigh). Hopefully your son will be at a location where he will have some kind of access and will be able to contact those at home sometimes too.  It helps to know they're really okay.  (My son was mostly based at Al Asad air base in Al Ambar Province but was often sent off base on \"missions\"). I was a nervous wreck while he was over there and can barely imagine you dealing with this as well as your own medical situation. It's very hard having a child of any age over there.  I wish you all the very best.  judy",
