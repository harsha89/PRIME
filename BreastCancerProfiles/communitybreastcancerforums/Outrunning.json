Aquaphor has lanolin so if you get horribly itching wearing wool use something else. Also it took me years to figure out that my hands itched due to a sensitivity to something in Dove Sensitive Soap (also in my kids shampoo). And that the itching was unrelated to the metal allergy to my Apple products. I've got to check out the ingredients on the Calendula cream. One company that was recommended is California Baby which were recommended to me by the RO's nurse. (Apparently also on the hand out I was given, if I actually too the time to read it. That's the problem with such a long wait. When I was given it, actually treatment was 3 weeks away so reading it didn't seem urgent.)",

And with only a couple exceptions ill have to go right to work. Should I try to get a small cooling towel, or cut one up, to put in my bra? Thankfully it is starting to be coat weather so I could put something under my clothes, put on my coat. Take it out when I get to the office 30-45 minutes later. I ordered the calendula California baby cream. Plus California baby liquid soap and corn starch baby powder (thank you Amazon prime) plus got Toms unscented deodorant at whole food.",

My biggest complaint is my nipple hurts, kinda like when it got irritated from breast feeding. But it isn't awful and hasn't required any meds. Other than that just a bit pink, my incisions are a little more twingey than it had been, and I'm a bit more tired than usual--but my schedule has been crazy too so not sure how much is rads and how much is life. For reference I ran a 10k yesterday and beat my goal pace. So definitely not debilitated.",

Bluedog is saw yours instead) confirmed that dizzy and nauseous are not uncommon SEs. Said They don't know why and suspect dehydration and confirmed what Molly said before. Drink lots of water. Boost started today. Glad I'm down to 4 to go. Getting itchy. But thankfully still not that bad. Mesharon I've made zero changes to my wardrobe for this. I am still wearing non-wire bras, but they pretty much look like wire ones and have lots of shaping padding. Doing that entirely because my LX incision is on the wire line and has been slightly irritated by the rads. Also only running in my most immobilizing sports bra so I don't further irritate my nipple. Otherwise dressing normally.",
