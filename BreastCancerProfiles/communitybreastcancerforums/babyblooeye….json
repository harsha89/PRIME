I was surprised to see there was still a mass there when they re-imaged for the clip placement. I was told three to five days but radiologist said I would hear from her Monday. It wasn't even painful, less painful than the mammo which says a lot BC that doesn't really hurt either. Still numb so let's not count the chickens before they hatch but all in all better than expected. They weren't able to get a skin sample but said let's wait for these results then have that evaluated. Suggested cortisone for now. Enough for now. T",
