I am completely terrified.I have a mammogram scheduled for next Thursday and I guess will find out then. Log in to post a reply",

Thing is, I don't have a lump in my breast atleast not that the doctor felt. I have 'classic' symptoms of IBC. The red bump that actually made me worry is one of the bigger symptoms according to my doctor. I also have 'swelling' of my right breast and it is noticebly larger than my left breast even though it hasn't always been that way. Along with swollen lymph nodes under my arm. Â  I will post the results as soon as I find them out. The next week is going to feel like an eternity.",
