I was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 13 and am now 18. The best thing is to have a positive attitude. Just some advice which you probably already know is to not show your fear or negative emotions around your daughter. It is almost best that she doesn't know much about it. That's exactly what my parents did and I just found out this year how scared they were. Keeping her calm is so important. It will let her have positive thoughts. Just assure her that everything will be fine. I would love to talk to you and your wife and daughter. I would love to help.",
