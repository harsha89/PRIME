Can't say enough how much I admire the strength and courage of everyone here!! I am doing AC + taxol for an isolated chest wall recurrence. Was going to just do XRT/hormonal blockade, but decided this is my last chance at cure and at the last minute (had CT planning for XRT last week, supposed to start this week) emailed my MO and said I will take your advice and do \"all of the above.\" Am beyond terrified of chemo.",
