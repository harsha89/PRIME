The oldest is graduating college this spring and the youngest is 19 and a sophmore at college!  Initially a stage 2, but by 33 I had bone mets, ovaries removed, oral chemo etc. But I know how you feel, being a young mom and nobdody really gets it...Wow.  I remember 15 years ago, I was in your shoes.  Although I didn't worry over scans.  I wanted to know what the heck was going on with the cancer. Can't stand not knowing if a treatment is working or not.  I go to Boston for treatment, and never waited long for results. Did you say three weeks to wait for the results?  Why so long?  I wonder if the onc is not available for an appt to discuss with you etc, so you are waiting for the onc?  If so, I would only schedule a scan when the onc is avail over the next few days to discuss.  Doesn't do you good to wait so long for results.  That would drive me nuts, and so in turn, I think I would drive them nuts with my questions over why they are making me wait, and how to make it easier for next time.  Believe me,after 15 years of these appts/scans/and crazy cancer life, I ask everything. Best of luck with the results!",
