How did you officially get diagnosed with truncal lymphedema?  I kept complaining at PT about getting a \"fat\" puffy feeling under my armpit and my right breast felt painful, though looking at breast and my side, you couldn't really see swelling.  It's hard to measure truncal LE as you can with an arm.  I don't think my PT was really aware of truncal lymphedema.  I did some research and brought in pictures and a medical article to show her.  I kind of diagnosed myself and then when I went to Mayo Clinic the physiatrist in LE clinic said yes I did.",

I work in health outcomes research and finally came across medical literature about this.  I knew something was wrong and physical therapists couldn't really \"see\" this truncal LD going on.  It's not like it can be measured like in the arm.  I kept complaining of fatness feeling under my arm and pain pressure in my affected breast that comes and goes.  I finally was diagnosed with it when I went back to Mayo Clinic for follow up for a SL of other complications I am dealing with on top of LD. Anyway, I've been fitted at the phy therapy center at my local hospital for various LD garments, that fortunately my insurance provides 8 pieces of LD garments per year.  In addition, it pays for mastectomy camis, etc.  Before I officially got the truncal lympedema Dx, I bought cami \"shapers/slimmers\" at Target.  I'm six months post-surgery but can't wear a bra anyway because of complications that are in my fold of my breast.  So after the offical truncal DX, the Mayo LD PT sent me to the specialty shop there.  I ended up getting a compression camisole that insurance paid for.  I actually like what I bought at Target better as it is prettier and more comfortable.  I also got a swell spot, which I tuck into the side of it.  It stays in place fairly well; however, I am thinking about sewing a small patch of velcro to camis and swell spot to keep in place. I had SIX drains from my surgery and at the same speciality shop got two mastectomy camis that had those pouches that were velcro inside the camis that could be removed.  They were great to hold all those dreaded drains.  I have had complications and will be having more surgery with drains (hopefuly not six again), and am glad I held onto those mastec camis as I was going to donate them back to the store.  So give a little velcro a try to keep things in place.  :) I have my first flight next month since all this BC hell.  I am a heart patient and have dealt with heart failure/edema in the past so when flying have worn compression socks and always did exercises for circulation and gone for walks up and down aisle.  Boy, and I thought that was a hassle. Now, I will have on my arm sleeve, hand and finger piece, compression cami, and swell spot.  I am thinking about not putting the swell spot in until after I pass through security because it looks a little suspicious IMO, kind of like a gun holster shape on my side.  :) ",

I haven't reviewed the SUSO site for about a year, and just went there again today.  I noticed in the Highlights column on the left that the following statement is now in bold letters:  \"... have concluded that axillary web syndrome is a risk factor for lymphedema.\"  Further down, #3 states \"Cording is associated with the risk or development of lymphedema.\"  (maybe it's always been there but I missed.) Do you know of any additional studies or journal articles that are more recent that you could direct me to relating to this (personally experienced) fact about AWS and LE?  Have any of your surgeons, rad oncs, etc. made these same statements about correlation between AWS and LE?  Perhaps Dr. Corrine Becker or her surgeons that have trained with her?  Also any new articles stating that whether cording is just scarring, or is lymphatic scarring? I'm going to copy this and post on a few other threads.  Thanks everyone, I appreciate your feedback and experiences!

Don't know where you live or your situation, but if you can go to Sloan Kettering, the name of the breast surgeon there who is tuned in to cording is Dr. Cody (per Tender).  From what I understand, Tender then took Dr. Cody knowledge to a PS at Johns Hopkins who did the surgery for her cording back in 2007, but that PS is no longer there. So, since Dr. Cody is still at SK, I called there and talked to a nurse who said they have two plastic surgeons there who have worked on cording as well as breast recon.  The names are Dr. Andrea Pusic and a Dr. Joe Pisa.  Dr. Andrea Pusic is very involved with advocacy for breast cancer patients, as well as programs to study quality of life of women after breast reconstruction.  She would be my first pick without even meeting her.  Just her interests alone spell out COMPASSION to me.  Here is a link to her bio: http://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/doctor/andrea-pusic I hope things work out for you, too.  Please keep us posted if you can.  Blessings!",

      "Content": "Jun 4, 2012 06:35PM PinkHeart wrote: Hi Everyone,  I haven't come back to post because I had hoped to have more positive news. At first I thought only the cording/webbing part of my surgery on April 27 was unsuccessful, however, things got even worse 4 days ago. During my surgery last month, my refractory axillary cording was excised along with \"conservative\" revision surgery on my radiated breast (done on a full/direct implant that was put in at time of immediate recon that's been a painful disaster from the get-go.)  At my follow up appointment 3 days post-op, the surgeon removed my one drain.  I told him that I was feeling pain down my arm to my wrist/thumb.  Said it was probably sore from surgery being on table.  He did not look at my axilla. I already had PT appointments set up to start on Day 10 after surgery back home locally.  Back at home and about a week out from surgery, the pain in my arm got worse and my arm started to bend/pull at the elbow.  I had a bad feeling and when I walked in to my first PT appointment with the same PT that worked on me for many months, she confirmed that I had new onset of axillary webbing/cording and it was much worse.  We counted the webs that went down to my thumb as you could see them and this time I took pictures.  The huge cord that was supposedly excised is smaller, but still there.  And, now there is a whole new \"mother\" cord that runs parallel to the original \"grandmother\" cord.  She has been able to manipulate the individual cords that ran down my arm and my arm extends straight and the pain does not run through wrist anymore.  She was just starting to work on the mother cord in my axilla, which BTW, when pushed on I could feel pulling under implant just as in the past with the other big cord.  It was too soon for her to start on scar release therapy.  The surgeon said he removed A LOT of scarring from the radiated breast (that was a mess even before radiation so that radiation cooked into stone such as the screwed up allerderm sling).  I was not getting relief from pain, however, my breasts did look a little better.  He had made new incisions in the IMF of both breasts to do revision work. Last week was 5 weeks post-op and I thought things would get better with more PT sessions and my home PT.  Then at my appointment with PT last week, I was on table with compression cami pulled down and she was gently working on cord in my right arm.  She happened to glance over at my right radiated breast, and said \"OMG, you are bleeding in your IMF scar.\"     She also does wound care and she cleaned it up and saw that the incision had split open and my implant was protruding.  She got out a mirror so I could see under breast, and it was creepy/ugly and not what anyone of us want to see.  I started immediately calling my surgeon who did not call back on his personal cell number he gave, nor did the call to his staff get sent on to him or another doctor there.  My PT was really concerned about infection and sent me to ER.  My surgeon did not call back the ER doc who left message, too. The ER doc thought he might just stitch me up, thought better of it (Thank GOD), and called a plastic surgeon.  The ER ended up irrigating and bandaging me together and put me on antibiotics.  I was determined to go to my son's high school graduation ceremony, then the next day I had surgery and the implant had to be removed.  My dear sister and a good friend spent the entire day getting together the house and food ready for the graduation open house I had planned for my son which was the next day after the surgery .  My kids and husband kicked butt, too, to make sure the party could still happen because I refued to cancel it.  It turned out really nice and my son was really happy which is what I most wanted. My surgeon did finally call me the night before surgery with a bunch of blah, blah, blah and said to have the local surgeon call him first before doing surgery.  Local surgeon didn't bother to call him, said it wasn't necessary at this point.  My surgeon who did revision & cording surgery said it probably split because I did too much, which I said I did not and even had to have him be more specific in discharge instructions and write a note for me not to lift more than 5 lbs with right arm and had to ask him how high I should lift arm after surgery, etc.  He questioned what the PT had been doing to me like she had caused the split..... Then he moved on to another theory that it split because I was on aspirin during surgery (had to because of heart) and that I probably had a hematoma going on the whole time and this caused the skin to not heal and split. The local surgeon just came right out and said, \"dear, your breast was a radiated mess and could not support an implant, and you just needed to go straight to getting new SKIN.\"  The local surgeon I found last minute does not do the tissue flaps or free flaps surgery, but what was GREAT news to hear is that they refer their patients to the \"NOLA\" plastic surgeons, whom I already had started consultations with about 4 weeks ago when I had the bad feeling that things weren't right and they were who I should have gone to first.  So, soon I will be posting to the NOLA thread, or actually the Charleston thread for Dr. M.    So I still have implant in left breast, and now my right breast is ugly and shriveled up and looks like skin tacked down in my chest.  I should be getting this latest JP drain out tomorrow.  Even though I still feel weak, I am returning to work tomorrow.  I did cancel a job interview I had scheduled in the afternoon.  I hate interviews as it is -- let alone with a surgery drain sewn in my side, sans a boob, trying to figure out my wardrobe, and chock full of oxy and xanax! So after 4 surgeries in one year thanks to breast cancer hell, I'm thankful my physical heart has weathered this well considering my heart history -- it's just my mental heart that is aching. Peace & Blessings to all of us.  :)",

I see the plastic surgeon at Johns Hopkins this Monday, March 5, and will also post what he says about my cording.  I mailed full CD of pictures (breasts before & after and cording) and med records last week.  During phone consult, he said he has experience working on cording, rebuilding chest walls, breast reconstruction (microsurgery/free flaps), and more.  I will be asking how many cords he has done for sure.  :) I will also be asking what the heck is entwined in this hunky cord -- nerves, arteries, veins, lymphatic vessels, fibrosis??  Can't wait to know what it is, and can't wait to get rid of it.  I believe my surgery involves both the cording and re-reconstruction of right breast so will be more complex.  I may ask about doing the cording first/alone to get it over with.  Because my breast was radiated after a full-one step implant immediate reconstruction, most surgeons say to wait a year.  I also have heart history so he may even turn me down for all I know.  About the third sentence out of his mouth was:  Do you have any medical conditions I need to know about? I'm starting to get anxious already.  I do feel better knowing that my brother is picking me up at the airport, taking me to Inner Harbor for dinner, and then to hotel.  (He lives 2 hours away in NJ/Philly area).  Other brother in DC can't make it.   I haven't seen him in years, so happy part of trip and not just all medical.

I haven't reviewed the SUSO site for about a year, and just went there again today.  I noticed in the Highlights column on the left that the following statement is now in bold letters:  \"... have concluded that axillary web syndrome is a risk factor for lymphedema.\"  Further down, #3 states \"Cording is associated with the risk or development of lymphedema.\"  (maybe it's always been there but I missed.) Do you know of any additional studies or journal articles that are more recent that you could direct me to relating to this (personally experienced) fact about AWS and LE?  Have any of your surgeons, rad oncs, etc. made these same statements about correlation between AWS and LE?  Perhaps Dr. Corrine Becker or her surgeons that have trained with her?  Also any new articles stating that whether cording is just scarring, or is lymphatic scarring? I'm going to copy this and post on a few other threads.  Thanks everyone, I appreciate your feedback and experiences!

I haven't reviewed the SUSO site for about a year, and just went there again today.  I noticed in the Highlights column on the left that the following statement is now in bold letters:  \"... have concluded that axillary web syndrome is a risk factor for lymphedema.\"  Further down, #3 states \"Cording is associated with the risk or development of lymphedema.\"  (maybe it's always been there but I missed.) Do you know of any additional studies or journal articles that are more recent that you could direct me to relating to this (personally experienced) fact about AWS and LE?  Have any of your surgeons, rad oncs, etc. made these same statements about correlation between AWS and LE?  Perhaps Dr. Corrine Becker or her surgeons that have trained with her?  Also any new articles stating that whether cording is just scarring, or is lymphatic scarring? I'm going to copy this and post on a few other threads.  Thanks everyone, I appreciate your feedback and experiences!

The next time; however, I did the appeal process myself.  My doctor sent me a letter of medical necessity, I wrote my opinion on why it should be covered.  I followed all the instructions on the back of the EOB for the appeal process. I sent it to BCBS via certified mail, so I had proof that they received it.  Then I received a letter from an appeals representative letting me know the status and her contact info.  I picked up the phone and called the rep immediately.   I very nicely let her know that I would be fighting it to the end and would take it on to the State if appeal was denied.  They have to complete the appeals process and respond back to you with the answer within 60 or 90 days (I have to check that again).  Anyway, I won my last appeal !!!  Of course, they waited until the very last day to call me to let me know. It was the most ridiculous bullshit I've ever dealt with because the test they denied was so obviously necessary, a Mayo doc is giving a thorough letter of necessity, and the time and money the insurance company spent to deny a $300 test was much more than the cost of the test!!!  I swear they randomly just deny things and hope the patients just pay it.  It is a freakin' hassle. I have a 3-ring notebook that I meticulously track all my EOBs, itemized statements, invoices, etc.  I even have a tab for \"Appeals.\"  I wish you much luck with your appeal -- and please don't give up -- but try not to get too stressed out over it either. When I get my BCBS EOBs in the mail, I have to BREATHE before I open them.  :)",

I also have severe axillary cording that could not be resolved after 50+ PT sessions.  It hinders the LE PT to be able to fully perform the MLD because it is a huge chunk dividing my axilla and gets in the way of moving fluid.  Also can't move it across chest where implant used to be because of collapsed breast with big chunks of scar tissue and floppy skin in the way. That's interesting that you mentioned the lymph nodes being harvested from the neck, as I just heard that from a doctor for the first time yesterday.  So if I go through with free flap reconstruction, I suppose I will still have swelling in that breast.  But at least I am rid of the painful implant! BTW#1, do you know if a patient is having some sort of two stage free flap reconstruction AND axilla recon w/ lymph node transfer, which is performed first, or are both done at first surgery? BTW#2, do you know of anyone who has had this lymph node transplant covered by insurance?  Anthem BCBS??? BTW#3, I had a \"revision\" surgery a few months ago that was NOT successful as I ended up with implant extrusion AND . . . the evil axillary cording that the surgeon tried to excise, caused new onset of axillary cording and became much worse in armpit and also had 5 cords that could be easily seen running all the way to my wrist.  Though the 5 wrist cords were very thin, they were certainly painful and my arm bent at elbow.  The PT got rid of the 5 separate cords easily, but the big mean one is still in my arm pit (the one that I thought was excised in surgery) and it now has an evil twin running parallel to it though not as big.  So I'm definitely paranoid about the \"axilla reconstruction\" part of this lymph node transfer surgery.  I have been telling my PT about this procedure, and she is hoping to go to Dr. M's next talk in Chicago. Good luck with your decision, and please keep us posted. ",

Dr Craigie removed drain #1 at discharge. It was drain for recipient site of Lymph Node Transfer in right axilla. No laughin' all you RN's out there, but i'm so excited I REMOVED DRAIN #2 ALL BY MYSELF TODAY! 😊 It was in my left breast that had major flap repositioning. Could see the tubing through my skin and it was pinchy so good riddance. Dr C showed me how and I had sterile suture kit to take home. Drain #3 is in my left groin which was the donor site for my LNT. Should come out in next day or two. Doc has me waiting until 10cc for two days this time. Also gave myself Lovenox shots. Actually prefer drain removal and that sense of relief/freedom. This was just my experience. Please check with your own doc regarding your individualized care.",

So far so good for me since LNT surgery, but realistically, I have done basically nothing the last three months except hibernate from cold weather, and baby my arm.   I do see PT-CLT therapist twice a week.  She does a mix of massage, scar release, work on axilla cording, and ROM in my unstable shoulder.  I'm really looking forward to being outside in hot weather and gardening and doing everything I did before breast cancer and then LE Dx.  It might warm up enough this weekend to melt snow and do some garden clean up.  Promised my PT I would not touch a shovel or rake.  :) I have 3rd breast recon surgery relating to my bilateral SGAP surgery coming up in three weeks.  Surgeon said a therapist is going to wrap my arm before surgery.  This time they will work on my radiated breast, as well as a lot of fat grafting to both breasts and scar revision.  Also going to try to resolve a neuroma.  A tiny bit nervous as most of the work involves my right side - LE side, but do have a highly experience surgeon that I trust.  Will only be a four hour surgery this time, and only one drain.  It will be considered 23 hour out-patient but will be in a private hospital room.  I am 3 months post-op from lymph node transfer done December 14, 2012.  My surgeon won't be doing any imaging this time.  I think he said at six months? ",

(Surprise again!)  My left breast did not have any cancer in it that I had opted to have removed also.  There are patients on here that have reported that invasive and non-invasive cancer was found in other supposed non-cancerous breast, too, when mammogram showed it to be clear. 7.  I woke up from surgery mentally prepared that if lymph nodes missing I was auto Stage II.  A nurse was quick to tell me I had to have an ALND-Axillary Lymph Node Dissection because of positive nodes, and I had six surgery drains. 8.  I was in hospital for three days.  The second day the resident doctor (breast surgeon went on vacation) came in with the FINAL pathology report to read to me.  She starts reading and says that I was a Stage 4, yes Stage 4, then starts stumbling and mumbling that something just wasn't right.  I had a difficult 7 hour mastectomy (plus 2 more hours for recon), and it turns out the pathologist made a mistake because one tumor under my fold was mashed into my chest wall with just \"dermal\" involvement.  However, it was NOT growing into my chest wall with \"epidermal\" involvement, which gives a patient an auto upgrade to Stage 4.  So definitely not news any patient wants to hear.  It was a mess getting new path reports and getting the wrong Stage off my medical records.  Not to mention this plants a little seed of medical distrust to get past.  9.  It was determined during the mastectomy that I would be needing radiation due to node involvement and location of tumor again chest wall.  Not all patients find this out at this time. 10.  I saw an oncologist 3 days after mastectomy while still in hospital.  He calmed me down about the mistake in in path report, and then discussed possibilities of types of chemo.  He also suggested doing the OncoType DX test, which determines if going through chemo would be beneficial of not.  It took 3 weeks to get OncoType test score back and my score was low enough to bypass chemo and take tamoxifen instead (which in the end I could not tolerate due to severe side effects, and am now not taking and choosing quality of life.) Other patients have had worse things happen than me, but please keep in mind that my experience is not the norm -- just bad luck piled on top of the bad luck of getting BC.  There are many, many more good medical professionals than bad, but we all should still be our own health advocates and hopefully have another to help you along the way. I wish the the absolute best with your treatments, outcomes, and recovery! ",

The severe side effects that some of us unfortunate patients ended up make ugly aftermath of BC surgeries painful and frustrating because so many PSs dont get it and even some family and friends think since you are alive then you are fine. Have any of your doctors suggested removing the implants? Or doing a revision to remove painful scar tissue and contracture? Or removing the failed implants and having natural breast reconstruction using your own fat and tissue (DIEP or SGAP) by a highly skilled microsurgeon who can repair some issues that may be causing your pain. Of course there are no guarantees with those options. The revision i had at one institution was worthless and surgeon made it worse and didnt bother to clean out chunks of scar tissue. Four weeks layer implant extruded through radiated breast skin and had to be removed. Then I researched and found a microsurgeon that Im totally comfortable with who did repairs and created my new breasts with natural breast reconstruction. He and his partner only work with breast cancer patients which i think makes a huge difference in high skill level but also understanding breast cancer patients. I wish you the best in your personal decisions and hope you get major improvement to your quality of life.",

Implant explantation is easy if that is all you are having done.  Still would want a doctor to smooth things out.  Some women have them removed, wait a year or two, and then rethink about natural breast recon.  Try to get as many opinions as you can. That's too bad you have to stay in Pennsylvania.  I travel out of state to Charleston, SC to Dr. Richard Kline.  He takes ALL insurance.  There may be a waiver in your insurance that if you can't find surgeon with skills to take care of your problems, that you can go out of state. http://www.naturalbreastreconstruction.com/kline.aspx Dr. Kline is a well known microsurgeon in the U.S.  He also is working on some nerve damage issues for me.  You really need to find microsurgeons/plastic surgeons who only work on breast cancer patients if you are a patient with a high degree of complications -- like me.",

My microsurgeon, Dr. Richard Kline (Charleston, South Carolina) also trained with Dr. Becker years ago, and recently met with her again in NYC.   I am scheduled for surgery on December 14.  He will be performing Stage 2 of my bilateral SGAP reconstruction, and also the lymph node transfer.  There will be 3 surgeons involved.  The PT-CLT (physical/lymphedema) therapist I saw there in Charleston when I had my Stage 1 surgery asked if she could attend my surgery to observe.  I told my surgeon perfectly okay with me to educate as many as possible.  My local PT-CLT is very up on this procedure and hopeful for me.  I wish she could travel with me for my surgery. My lymph nodes will be taken from around left groin area as a small flap with arteries, then transfered to area in my right axilla.  The incisions will be minor; however, under my axilla the incisions may be visible with certain swimsuit or tank top styles.  I've got so many scars from breast reconstruction failures (from implants and radiation) and having natural breast reconstruction using my own skin flaps to fix everything, that one more scar doesn't matter to me. Do you have LE garments you can wear instead of bandaging?  For my arm I have daytime sleeves to wear, and I now have a night time sleeve to wear for bed.  I also have a LymphaPress machine that takes about 30 minutes to reduce any fluid in my arm or chest wall/trunk.

It would be interesting to know Dr. Becker's thoughts on that study. I may even ask my surgeon at my next appt. He emails with me promptly with my zillions of questions but I'll save the LNT study questions when I see him face to face in a few months. I will say that he is very conservative and made me really think about it. He has never had a patient have LE worsen. He trained with Dr Becker and still meets with her. Darn, i wish i could read the entire journal article on that study. I previously worked in health outcomes research and could read articles to the hundreds of medical publications we subscribed to. Oh well, my eyes usually glaze over trying to understand the statistical methods. :) I am 4 weeks post op for my LNT surgery done at the same time as my stage 2 SGAP breast recon surgery. It was a 7 hour surgery but the LNT portion was only 2 and half hours. So far i am doing great. What pain that i still have is from my SGAP surgery. My LNT flap in my axilla recipient site seems happy and my groin donor site is healing nicely. Im shocked that i dont have any swelling after reading the operative notes and work performed in that area. My surgeon still prescribed continued appointments twice weekly with my PT-CLT and to wear day and night sleeves as often as possible. I plan to post my operative notes for the LNT sometime when at desktop computer and not from my iPhone. Again, im doing well from LNT and I wish the same for all other patients making same personal choice. Now I just have to be patient and hope that one year, two years, etc from now that im not still screwed by lymphedema--breast cancer's dirty little secret.",

It was actually a mini flap with nodes and artieries that needed to be anastomized (sewn/connected) to artery in axilla. There was no skin paddle like you see in natural breast reconstruction. The scar from the donor site is very faint now. However, the scar at transfer site in axilla was still noticeable in some tank tops this summer. Probably because he has had to work so many times on that ugly radiated side in stages. At post-op appointment of my most recent surgery #10 last month (which was fat grafting only and first time no drains-yay!), he told me that he would not work on my rads breast anymore until July 2015 because each time they go into that area they are disturbing the lymphatics/nodes and they need more time to grow. If having LNT surgery alone it would be about 2.5 hours but mine was 7 as it was combined with stage 2 breast recon SGAP surgery. A PT-CLT wrapped my arm in hospital before and after surgery. My vessels were challenging as he said smallest ever to sew together and used thinnest suture thread on market. It should be a breeze for other patients having LNT only.",

Anyway, finally found a good PS I can trust (and that is kind enough to email and talk on phone). I am tentatively scheduled for surgery on April 27th, at Johns Hopkins.  PS will excise the cording in right axilla, work on right radiated breast releasing scar tissue and contracture and make the pocket bigger to (hopefully) alleviate pain, and on left breast fix cosmetic issues (waves, ripples, & lumps) and recreate IMF (fold under breast) that got obliterated from the massive hematoma that happened 5 days post surgery and had to be surgically reopened and evacuated.  He would have liked (and me, too) to have done microsurgery by transplanting skin from my abdomen (no fat because I'm too thin) to replace the skin on my radiated breast to cover implant.  The skin on the outside actually looks great -- it's just the inside muscle that's cooked.  The reason why he is just doing \"conservative\" surgery is I have heart problems . . . .  I\"m trying to be postive that this surgery won't be as bad as last July with initial surgery.  It will only be 2-3 hours long and he said I might have one drain (which is a happy thought after having 6 drains after first surgery).  He said it would normally be out patient but he is going to keep me over one night to monitor heart. I hate having to go through more pain to hope to alleviate pain, but I won't give up.  I will start PT immediately after the surgery.  I still have nerve pain, and my shoulder is getting wimpy.  My case is currently being reviewed by a \"hand to shoulder\" orthopedic surgeon so I may have an appointment with him before or after surgery.   PS suggested having shoulder doc on board (locally).  Peace & Blessings!",

I have pain everywhere on right side:  shoulder, pec muscle, breast, armpit, down my arm, and it's getting worse.  I can get through the day with very limited exertion with just feeling \"uncomfortable\" without pain meds, but by dinner, I am in tears.  I had to double my pain meds last night, and all I could do is cry while my husband held me not knowing what to do.   My plastic surgeon hasn't been very helpful in my tearful opinion, and I'm now being referred on to a senior plastic surgeon.  I had some major pain in the fold of my right breast from the minute I woke up, and the hard as a rock right breast was like that from the beginning, like the pocket was too small, and the fold is stitched into my chest muscle so tight my breast and skin on lower torso will barely move.  I had a double mastectomy and the left breast is fine with absolutely no pain!!!  During my consultation, the PS discussed that he would be giving me botox injections during the surgery, but he never did, and couldn't give me an answer why not.  Now that I am in severe pain, he didn't even offer.  Another doctor made the suggestion of Botox in pec muscles.   There seems to be some controversy/difference of doctor opinion regarding the immediate reconstruction with Direct One-Stage implant with alloderm.   My pain started as soon as I woke up from surgery.  My right breast was hard as a rock even 8 weeks post surgery.  So I make a video showing how hard the right breast was and would not move, as compared to the left.  I sent the video to the PS.  I did this because I wanted to demonstrate that it was like this BEFORE radiation which I started the day after I did the video.  I am now 5 weeks post radiation (and had radiation fatigue/flu so bad that I did not get out of bed for days, except to go to radiation, and the fatigue was still gripping me four weeks after radiation.)  My breast does not look any different, but PS still went and stated in notes that radiation causing problem.  So my right breast had 8 weeks to \"rest\" before it got radiation.  Big question for all of you if you made it through all my rambling.  :) With all the pain you are dealing with, how are you all tolerating the TAMOXIFEN?  I was on it for 10 days prior to radiation, and my local radiation onc discontinued it because she prefers her patients not take it during radiation treatment.  Well, thank God for that, because just during the 10 days I was on it (my heart was also monitored while taking it), I was nauseated and vomited, but got over that after a few days and taking it after dinner instead.  But, the side effect of Tamox that hit me hard was about five days after starting it, I had INTENSE pain in my hips, knees, legs.  I could barely walk (I am a former runner, and thin, and outdoor lover.)  The rad onc said it was the Tamox and I would need to take NSAIDS.  (My cardiologists have always warned me to stay away from NSAIDS.)  BTW, I have a rare heart problem, so all the local PS docs that I keep getting second opinions from are running from me - I'm a high risk patient and have to have surgeries performed in a major hospital with operating rooms for open heart if complications happened - so no surgery centers or suburban hospitals can do breast revision surgery for me. My med onc is starting me back on the Tamox in 3 weeks, at half the dose to start, and will titrate to full dose (20 mg) after a few weeks.  I AM IN SO MUCH PAIN NOW, I AM DREADING TAKING TAMOX BECAUSE I CAN STILL FEEL THE PAIN IT CAUSED IN MY LEGS JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.  I really, really want to be positive about tamox and it's added survival benefits, but the pain in my upper right chest/breast/shoulder, etc. is more than I can bear as it is.  So how adherent are you with anti-hormone drugs with having PMPS??? Also, someone earlier in these posts mentioned a doctor at MD Anderson.  I was already considering going there for a fifth \"second opinion.\"  It sounds like I need to give up on PS, and look for a pain doctor in a major pain center who \"appreciates\" PMPS, so I have some backing to educate my local PCP (who I trust, but just needs to really understand this).  I feel like all that doctors, friends, and family think about with regard to breast cancer is we'll help you keep your strength through the radiation and chemo, and then you'll be fine when you finish it, and you'll just move on and life is normal again.  And even some breast cancer survivors don't understand why I'm so \"down\" and not moving on and why I had an extended leave of absence from work.  They have never heard of PMPS or AWS, and that includes my kind PCP/family doc.  Doesn't the Komen foundation have any advocacy efforts established for these two very real risks/side effects/problems (PMPS & AWS) of breast cancer patients???  Just go Google or PubMed all this, and there are numerous medical journal articles about it!  Even the Mayo Clinic patient education materials have NO mention of AWS, and I was not informed about it by anyone there (and there is much compassionate care there).  So that's what's so sad about this --  if a world reknowned health institution like Mayo is overlooking these two syndromes, then we have a SL of advocacy work ahead of us.  (StepUpSpeakOut.org has done a wonderful job with lymphedema and AWS).  Are there any PMPS organizations with major websites available? I've learned a lot from all of you sharing your pain experiences on this post, and my heart goes out to each and every one of you.  Very Heartfelt Blessings to you all!",

I had major relief of pain.  The surgeon repaired a lot of the damage in chest wall, pec damage, rads damage, and removed huge chunks of scar tissue.  After about 2-3 hours of repair work the two surgeons moved on to my new breast reconstruction part of surgery.  So total surgery hours came to about 12 hours.  That was just for Stage 1 of surgery. I still have some pec muscle pain in upper right side that I am still working on with a PT.  But at least I am not eating pain meds anymore.  There's no guarantees, but it might be worth looking into if you wish.
