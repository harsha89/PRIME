Started A/C every 3 weeks in November. First two sessions went relatively great! No nausea, a few mouth sores and funny tastes, and very little appetite loss. Still managed to lose a few pounds. Then, WHAM, on the third treatment I had a a suspected \"extravasation\" of the Adriamycin. Scary stuff. (I suddenly became the most popular girl in the chemo room! Treated 3 days with an antidote drug that knocked me for a loop. Resceduled third treatment for following week which was followed by exhaustion, vomiting, loss of appetite, 8 pounds more lost (not good). Hoping the final treatment next week goes back to my normal as they feel the antidote drug set me up for failure. Also, two weeks later my bicep over the vein where it was injected is burning with pain. Thanks for all the great info here.",

It also left a slight reddenned area very quickly which is what sprung my nurse into action. I had slight burning at my first injection but the put a warm cloth on it and it went away. She knew by my description of the pain that this was different. Glad she was on the ball. It's way scarier after I looked it up! The antidote drug page says \"Prepare for the worst, hope for the best\"....Yikes! leave it to me to get one of the rarest side effects. Hope that means I've been pre-didastered as I've still got over a year of injections ahead! (herceptin plus clinical trial drug)",

The \"extravasation\" is one of the things they warned me about...very rare... ( If you feel any burning, YELL!). I was lucky to have a great nurse who recognized it right away and yanked the Adriamycin with just 1cc injected. The effect can be quite horrible (tissue damage, necrosis, amputation, oh my) if not treated. Treatment kind of stunk too. Three extra days of a chemo like drug with nasty side effects. Happens even more rarely with a port.Â  BTW, Monstermum is shortened from a kids' book we used to read called \"Monstermama\". (It was taken already!)",
