Â I had to wait one week each after each of my surgeries, and four weeks for the Oncatype result (the doctor forgot to send the tissue in so a two week wait became a four week wait). Looking back the advice I would have given myself is to keep busy, exercise a lot, talk with friends and family, hang out with your kids or grandkids, and breathe. The time will pass. Wishing you good luck.",
