Yesterday I happened to feel above my L breast and noticed how tender it was. I've been on antibiotics for a sinus infection (only 2 days), so at first I didn't think anything of it. It did remind me I haven't done a self exam in awhile, so I decided to check. There is dimpling under my breast, and an \"off color\" spot. I also noticed red dots (like red freckles) on just my L breast. So, of course I \"Dr. Googled\" it, freaked out, then somehow managed go to sleep and wake up calm- convinced it was probably just my sinus infection and I was paranoid. I got in the car to drive this afternoon and I noticed how much more sore the lymph nodes were now- like it hurt to drive sore. Needless to say I called for an appointment with my GYN and they are able to get me in tomorrow morning. My GYN is a great guy and really listens to his patients. (He listens so much that during my yearly-check up a few months ago he didn't get to the breast exam. I assured him I hadn't felt anything weird and he promised to do it at the next exam.) Given that he listens and it sounds like my GYN office is already taking this seriously, what should I expect? Are there any questions you wish you would have asked at the first appointment? If it looks \"bad\" should I expect the Dr to push for testing sooner than later? My husband is going with me for support, and can help advocate if needed. I'm trying not to worry, but I have some other symptoms (loosing 4 pounds in the last month, loss of appetite) that make me more concerned. Any advice would be wonderful! :) Log in to post a reply",
