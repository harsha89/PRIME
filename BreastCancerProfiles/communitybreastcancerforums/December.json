      "Content": "Sep 23, 2015 10:02PM December wrote: HomeSchool4Us, I think your timing is just off a bit and that is why response has been slow - I just tonight saw your post- and I don't know how I missed it because I check almost daily. But I will add, that when I first joined, I missed many responces because I didn't know how to look/find them. But let me assure you, HERE, you are NOT alone. And this comes from the crankiest member in the organization! I am 57 next week, 2 kids, 2 Grandsons, live alone in the foothills of the Smoky Mts. I had mamograms every year, and constant self exams. No family history. When I found my swollen breast area, I was not concerned. My Mammogram was due anyway. To make a long story short, I went from being told \"Its probably nothing\" to \"5cm ILC\" after my BMx. Was told probably no chemo, Well, I'm just finished with round 5 of 6 and after that, Rads. I have begun the reconstruction process - but that will be delayed 6 months after Radiation. I was dxed Stage 3, Grade 2 right after surgery. It was very upsetting. But one thing I've noticed by reading all the diagnosises and treatments posted here - It looks to me like the stage and grade are not that important. I've seen Stage 4 Ladies posting here for over a decade. I've seen Stage 0 and Stage 1 Ladies jump to Stage 4 in just a few months (skipping all the stages inbetween), with death following sometimes. I know one thing from certain. (Quote from movie Rudy) \"There is a God, and, I'm not Him\". I even told my Onc that I didn't even want to discuss my \"prognosis\" - I told her she was't God, and she has no idea of what kind of a driver I am! She laughed, and told me \"Great\" - said she hated the question \"How long do I have?\" Because as she agreed, she's NOT GOD. Along with this chatty post, I will also tell you that there is only one thing I fear about death - and that's not having all my ducks in a row! I want to have all my bills paid, all my pictures in scrapbooks, well, you know. But death, doesn't scare me at all. Yep, sure will miss a lot of folks on Earth - but can't wait to hug my grandparents. And I've got a LOT of questions to ask God when He does call me home. I guess there is one other thing I'm not happy with - all the treatment crap - but so far I've been pretty comfy - Well, Chemo sucks big time - but it's not forever. Anyway, I think illness or no, everyone lives a happier, more fullfilled life when they accept their mortality as humans and find peace and comfort in their acceptance. I'm not meaning that we should pray to bring death early - no, no, no, but just to take a good look at it - it is a reality for us all - come to healthy terms with it - and then live your life! I have read other places that Stage 4 Ladies feel a great since of peace when they finalize all of the end-of-life details - and most say, \"Why the heck didn't I do this before the cancer...instead of having this hanging over my head all these years!\" The reason for all this \"negativity\" in this post - is because of something I read in one of your posts- I'd like to say \"I heard it in your voice\". Of course you are completely destroyed! 8 Kids and counting! So many depending on you! How on earth are you going to manage the family and the treatments at the sametime! I'd be scared to death in the beginning. BTW, I homeschooled my ADHD kids for 3 years - LOVED every minute of it! You are demanding answers right now, and rightfully so. But the truth is, and what you can find peace in - is that no matter how many test results you get back - you will never really have the answers you want. And Sweetie, that's just the way it is for everyone walking the Earth - there are no answers - there's always another test - and there is always another \"concern\". But there is nothing so earth-shattering that you should be thrown into a whirlwind. Everyday, you wake up to new blessings, new concerns, new aches and pains. And new joy. I would suggest that you find doctors that you truly have faith in - and go from there - one day at a time. Please, do not let illness steal one moment of joy with your family. It is easy to fall in the \"pity party\" thing, fall in to real depression, and to feel lost, alone, and overwhelmed. That's just part of it. Surely, with 8 kids, you've gone to the \"pity party\" before? I'd bet that with 8 kids - you've already experienced all of the emotions that you will swim through going through cancer treatments. You can ask the other members here, I've let myself go to the pity parties, and, especially the anger parties, too many times - but hey, we are human! There are forums here just for venting - you can even cuss if you feel like it! And I was never a cussing lady before - but I've certainly ran to the venting and anger forums and showed my \"butt\" with very ugly language....usually to delete the post the next day....but venting does feel good - will even make you laugh! So, I'm not suggesting that you bury your emotions, but to acknowledge them, and to look forward to your next joyful moments - because there will be many - if just over the next few months, or over the next many years! I wish I could answer all of your questions from your previous posts - I wish someone had answers for me! But I think that you know deep down inside, the only answer you want to hear is \"everything will be alright\"! And that's what I'm here to tell you, one way or another, everything will be alright. You will actually get acustomed to this way of living - never knowing exactly what is instore for you next. It will just be a way of life for you. The sun is going to rise every morning, wether you decide to rise with it or not. You will discover that you are way stronger than you think you are - but in some ways, you are weaker than you ever thought you were. But overall, you will be stronger, a better mother & mate - for having faced all this confussion and scary stuff and for some how figuring it all out! Just remember, you are not alone. Everytime I try to go to the pity party - I read about some else who has a more difficult story - and whose courage embrassed my own. You are just now going to discover who you really are! One of the things I posted here back in Feb was \"Why Me?\" I did everything pretty much right. I've already lived through a lifetime of challenges! Isn't enough, enough?\" One of the ladies here wrote me back - all she said was \"I just ask, Why Not Me?\" My prayers are with you and your family. I wish you many more Blessings and much Joy. And I pray you have the strength to grasp the Blessings and Joy each and every day! I could go on and on about the things I've learned, the joy that has come into my life - all because I've got this new challenge to work through. But, I'll save that rant for another day! Blessings, December (Jerilyn from the Smoky Mts. - Granny GG to my grandsons!)",

I had a BMX May 5th, which surprised all the doctor and myself as the ILC tumor was 5cm and not less than 3 as previous images suggested. During the BMX, I also had the beginning of recon with TEs. But after my surgery, it was confirmed that chemo and RADS would be needed. I can't have the final exchange surgery until 6 months after Rads (something about changes in the skin) So, I'm stuck with these aweful TEs from this past may, to probaby about May 2016 or even summer. So that's a year at least, of living with the TEs. Only because the radiation treatment was not expected at the time of the surgery. Had things gone as planned, even with the Chemo, I would be able to do the TE exchange this winter. I'm all for the recon - it's just a matter of when you want to start it - and there are pros and cons either way. It was nice to wake up with little boobs after the surgery - and I've been able to do the fills when ever I want ( no rush anymore)....But that way I had 2 surgeries at once - which was nice - but having to live with these TEs (rocks) for so long has been very uncomfortable. And knowing that I will have to live with them for many more months:( However, I am glad that I have \"breasts\" and can wear my C bras again - so I look \"normal\" with clothes. Knowing what I know at this point - I would have waited until after the RADs - I mean, I'm not winning any beauty awards right now with my bald head and pale skin....so having breasts that look normal under my clothes doesn't seem to be near as important and having the day to day discomfort of the TEs. Besides, I think that some doctors now do direct to implants - and you can avoid the TEs completely. You really need to talk to a couple of PSs.......Make sure you find an excellent one. (BTW, I have a friend who stayed flat, and loves it! Best wishes and Prayers for you! Dang - my beloved Vols are in overtime after being ahead the whole game!",

It's interesting to hear that perhaps I need to start ASAP - sounds like a good idea as long as I can skip a week during chemo treatments. It's good to hear from some of you that you have dealt with this problem successfully. There is hope for us all. Yes, 2Tabbies, this diesease makes us all angry! I guess one of the things that seems wierd to me is that with ILC, no cancer famiy history, and no \"lump\" - I walk into the doctor visit very healthy and walk out very sick - and I never felt \"sick\" until the treatments started. Guess what I\"m trying to say is - normally a person has a tummy bug, or an infected, angry place on their body somewhere, or some kind of pain and go to their doctor to get well. I went to the doctor thinking over all I was well with no real concerns - and come out sick. With ILC, I just had a thickening in part of my breast (thought it was a minor breast infection of some kind) so I can't help to wonder did I really have cancer? I know it's crazy - but all of this seems to be a very bad dream. Thanks to all and many blessings!",

I'm taking Hydros for the pain - that helped me greatly in the beginning....but seems to be less effective as I go along. Basicly I havee 2 bad weeks, one better week, then the next treatment and it starts all over again. I didn't want to do the hydros..but realized I could not do the chemo without them....Everything HURTS....so, on (treatment4) (my 'good week\") I try to not take the Hydros.... made it from Mon till Sat. Almost a week....but broke down today and took a pill...and will probably do so again Sun....My question is....is it common for the bone/nerve pain to stick around 2/3 weeks after chemo treatment? i'm sure that they will give me whatever pain killers i want....but I don't want any of them! I thought I could take a week off....but I hurt so bad I gave in today. Should my MO change my pain killers....to something different? But my big question is...does anyone hurt bones/muscles/nerves....ALL the time? 2 more treatments.....then on to Rads....I can see the light at the end of the tunnel....Also, the Hydros reallly destroy my digestion tract....and the constapation is VERY painful.....Lower ab sevier cramps....I hate the Hydros....is there a better pain killer out there? I've go 2 more treatments......But i'M NOT sure I can do it. Such a shame after going through 4 'dense\" treatments.......Someone post some support for me. I don't want to quit;;;;but I have been in pain since June - I dont think I can do 2 more treatments!",

Also, I've got a rather large knot/lump under my right arm where I had my ALND surgery June 6 - Follow up with surgeon said it's probably scar tissue or fluid build up. He said we could do a scan - but the results would not change current treatment. So, I'm waiting until I'm through Rads to re-scan. Any THOUGHTS? On another note - has anyone seen the LifeTime movie \"Geralyn\"...not a great movie - but as a women with BC - it's interesting - exploring a young woman's breast cancer journey. Supposedly based on a true story. Blessings to all! (Treatment 6 Oct 5 - then on to Rads!)",

I've seen where others here are \"achy\"....I'm taking Hydros to avoid as much pain as possible because mine has been really tough! Lots of \"pain\" - even with the Hydros, lots of lower ab pain - not as much nasea as in the beginning - more like very painful gas/constapation. But my big question is about what I would call \"muscle pain\" ... I know that bone pain is common - I'm not sure I can tell the difference between bone pain and muscle pain. But I want it to STOP now. Enough is enough. I get these frequent \"jabbing\" pains - sort of like being shocked by electricity - sudden sharp pains that bring me to my knees! It could be in my bones - or my muscles - I can't tell. But even with the Hydro pain killers - the pain is there. I know if I can get through the next week or so I should be on my way! Rads next! Anybody else having these sharp, stabbing pains? When do they finally stop? Thanks! Prayers to all & many Blessings!",

That's the one thing I got real lucky about - my skin looks better than it ever has. And as far as the biopsy - I thought it hurt like H*&^!!! I know they said it wasn't supposed to hurt - but I thought I would jump though the ceiling! I'm sorry you are still having pain from the procedure. Pain sucks. Come on Oct 20th! I know you are more than ready to end this part of your life. I'm still having SEs, but I just keep reminding myself that I don't have to go back for more. That is a GREAT comfort. It was suggested to me today that my body aches might be a SE of the hormone blocker that I started right before chemo - I guess I'll know in a few weeks since body aches are not supposed to be a part of Rads (starting that mid Nov.) If the body aches are a SE of the hormone blocker - don't know what I'll do. Can't be on pain killers forever! I wish I had some helpful advise - but I don't. Just encouragement and prayers. And since you are coming upon your last treatment, maybe the red bumps will go away on their own. Well, we can only hope. Please keep us all posted because someone else probably has the red bump SE, too. Or someone who comes into chemo a year from now. I know I've read most every post here - especially during the early dx time - looking for any info I could find. I appriciate some of the older posts - very helpful. Also, keep us posted about your chemo SEs. I'll try to keep my SEs posted to let people know how long they can expect SEs to linger, well, at least in my case. Prayers and Blessings!",
