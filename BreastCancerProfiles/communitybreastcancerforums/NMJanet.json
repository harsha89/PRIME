Originally diagnosed with BC in 2010, diagnosed with bone mets Oct. 2014 in my spine, ribs, femurs and pelvis. Still feeling devastated after all this time but getting better at handling it now. Trying to enjoy life everyday. Most days are pretty good, others send me spiraling down. Taking Arimidex and getting monthly Xgeva injections. Had tremendous pain from the Arimidex but it stopped when I started the Xgeva. Other than an almost constant mild, low back pain, I feel fairly well most days. Last CT scan showed slight improvement in my bones so meds seem to be working. Lots of hot flashes, trouble sleeping, lack of energy sometimes but everything is tolerable at this point. Just started acupuncture and I did sleep better that night. Like everyone else, hoping this turns out to be a chronic condition for many, many years.",

I'm relatively new to posting here but as many can tell you, the initial diagnosis and first few months can be the most terrifying, gut wrenching, crazy, depressing, horrible times. Eventually you will probably settle into a routine and if your wife responds to treatment, that will help even more. It doesn't necessarily get easier as time goes on, it just gets different. I read everything I could find online also, and it scared me to death. As many have said here before, your wife is an individual, not a statistic. She could have a much longer life than statistics give her. There are new treatments coming out all the time. Try to let go of your fears as much as you can and focus on having the most wonderful life with your wife---no matter how long it turns out to be! (((hugs)))",
