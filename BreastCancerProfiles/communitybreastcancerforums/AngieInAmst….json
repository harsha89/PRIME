Slept 3 days straight, somehow completely missing Christmas. The dizziness and extreme headaches knocked me out. And nausea was a constant feeling, but happily no vomiting. I\u2019m not sure if anyone else is going through this, but I\u2019ve been having fever-like strange and unusual dreams. Probably sleeping for so long may have been the reason. I did try the fast mimicking diet, and believe it did help with se\u2019s. Muscle and bone pain are at minimal, but this could just be the 1st treatment. They say chemo is cumulative, so not sure if se\u2019s will be increasing. Hoping that the fast mimicking diet continues to help. I\u2019m also currently cold capping, but find it quite bothersome. Makes it difficult to take bathroom breaks dragging around an iv stand and cold cap hose. Anyone else cold capping? Is it really worth all the effort? Not sure I\u2019m able to stick with it. Hope everyone\u2019s side effects are mild and manageable. Wishing you all the best this coming new year. ",

Kinda needed it, since not getting much sleep from last night. Kber, since you gave such great details regarding your experience with Taxol, I now know what to expect.

Meeting with MO this Friday after bloodwork (3 week cycle). Will ask her for referral to pulmonary specialist regarding cough/ lung issues. I believe I may be experiencing Pneumonitis. All symptoms point in that direction. I do recall when meeting with RO regarding radiotherapy, she mentioned that in some cases (15-20%), one of SE is delayed Acute or radiation Pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs). Which could occur 1-6 months after radiotherapy. Flu like symptoms of low grade fever, body and muscle aches, headaches, and general malaise with chest cough. I've also done some research recently, and read that about 15% of patients who have received radiation treatments are prone to acute/ radiation Pneumonitis and especially those who've received a taxane (Taxol or taxotere) are at high risk. Hopefully seeing a lung specialist will help alleviate the flu like symptoms and cough. Have already been feeling so sick for 5 weeks. And I'm certain, it will also take some time to recover from this. Becky, you've put it so well about seeing life in cancer increments of time. How many weeks or months this journey has been and still is. Last Thursday was 6 months exact post surgery. So, Friday. I took a selfie of what they looked like. (To spare everyone, won't post it.) Kber, I too am still kinda in somewhat of denial. I go about with the routine of hospital visits, but never giving any thoughts to the consequences towards the future. So, I'm not sure how I'll be feeling once active treatment ends and then I'm left with time to really soak up the whole experience. But for now, I can only focus on taking it one step at a time. Love your quote,\u201cface against the wind, one foot in front of the other.\" Be well, my sisters. xx  ",

The sentimental values will more than make up for the fatigue. Becky and Mary, onco nurse also warned me of muscle fatigue from the accumulation of chemo. She did say it could take months to recover. Finally went to rehab fitness on Monday for the first time in 5 weeks. Was definitely a bit harder. Could only bike for 5 mins at just 50 watts. Previously, could do 70watts, 4 min, 90 watts 2 mins, and then 70 watts finishing 4 mins. These past 6 weeks have really taken a toll on my lungs and body. Luckily so far, nails are hanging in there. But who knows after finishing Taxol. I hear they still may fall off. Beginning to see baby bird-like hair sprouting. This will take months I\u2019m sure. On prednisone, a corticosteroid. It\u2019s working to reduce lung inflammation from pneumonitis. Will take several weeks to recover. Lots of crazy SE\u2019s. One of which includes wild mood swings. And with Taxol, depression also hits hard. I already noticed how easily frustrated I get over things. Trying not to take it out on the people around me. Fighting cancer is not easy.

But when I would wear a beanie, I found it a bit too warm. Could be due to cold capping. Had it the previous 2 rounds, 4.5 hrs at 26 degrees F/ -3C. Guess I was used to the cold sensation.

Bloodwork looks the same as last time, but have been feeling really tired and worn down. So much, that I must have really looked depressed. The onco nurse thought that I might want to speak with a psychologist/ therapist to help with this whole process. Since already looking and feeling very fatigued from last week\u2019s chemo, in addition to runny nose and watery eyes, I must have really looked down and out! After speaking with onco nurse, usually there is a follow up with MO for prescriptions or recommendations, and today MO asked if I wanted to see a psychologist. I didn\u2019t really think I needed an appointment, but said yes, anyway. MO thought it a good idea to have an initial visit and can decide after 1st meeting to see if I would like to continue with the psychologist. This is such a difficult journey with so much for us to bear mentally and physically that it makes sense to talk with someone on a professional level to help work out the emotional stress that we feel on a day to day basis. On a different note, anyone else going through 12x weekly taxol? How does it differ from AC or C? Next week is last AC treatment and then 3 months of taxol. It feels never ending. This is now 5 months since diagnosis in late August. (Already had surgery and radiation). No wonder they recommended seeing a psychologist. I wonder if it is a different experience having chemotherapy as neojuvant vs. adjuvant therapy. Would love to hear if you have an opinion on chemotherapy before or after surgery. Wishing everyone well xx",

If the Y offers that program in your area, definitely sign up! I know that I'm handling chemo rather well because I am on a fitness routine similar to LIVESTRONG via my hospital, lead by the cancer rehabilitation team. It's kept my strength and endurance fitness level to nearly what I was before chemotherapy treatments that even the team fitness trainer was impressed with how fit I am while undergoing treatment. I highly recommend it! Especially if it's at low or no cost. I always feel so much stronger after my sessions. 💪🏼💪🏼  ",

Generally, I\u2019m very hydrated before sauna. I\u2019ll have about 1.5 liters of water beforehand, since usually I gym before sauna. Hydration helps with sweating. I never knew about chemo tears. Now it all makes sense. After my 3rd AC treatment, had my first Reiki session. Was a bit skeptical, but wanted to an alternative approach to energy healing. The moment the practioner started the music, and I was relaxed, tears immediately rolled down my cheeks. I had no control over them. I wasn't even thinking about anything. Streams of tears would continue throughout the session. All 45 mins. I felt a little embarrassed. But afterwards, there was a sense of relief. I continue Reiki sessions about once a month. Helps to clear my mind a little. Flower- I\u2019m with you on losing nearly 90% of brows and lashes. Wish I were good at drawing on brows. They just never look quite right. One more month of chemo to go. It\u2019s been a long 5 months ofAC-T. Looking forward to getting some normalcy back. Wishing everyone well! xx",

Expecting round 4 to take at least a week as well. @Kstinedk, I too will begin Taxol after Valentine's. My MO said that Taxol is supposed to be easier with SE, although onco nurse said that SE were different. Not so much nausea, but chance of neuropathy. But I'm sure chemo fatigue may still be about the same. I usually go at least once or 2x a week for an hour exercise routine lead by the hospital physiotherapists to help maintain muscle strength and counter fatigue. It has helped while on AC, hoping that it will help fight against neuropathy while under Taxol. @kber, I'm in agreement with you on how much it means to watch your son walk graduation. My mother was not able to visit me during my years at university, but I know that witnessesing me graduate was one of her proudest moments. Seems you've put much consideration and thought towards your Taxol schedule. And if you are only able to get an extra week before graduation; still gives you a little more time to recover. @Becky, following up on whether you did the event at your college. If so, how was it? Photos if you have any. @Lillian and @Flower, hope SE are not so heavy from treatment earlier this week, Wishing everyone a mild and easy week. xx",

Anxious and Nanette, I\u2019m learning to let go of mainstream society\u2019s view of what a woman is supposed to like. I haven\u2019t completely gone topless everywhere yet. It\u2019s also still too cold to go outside without a hat. But I am beginning to go topless more so indoors. So far, it\u2019s mostly at the hospital gym where most of the participants are breast cancer survivors, so we don\u2019t mind our baldness. I\u2019ve gone to the regular gym topless, since working out can get quite sweaty. Plus, I treat my self to a hot Finnish sauna afterwards, thus, only a bathing suit is allowed. I\u2019ve gotten a few stares from men (next time, I\u2019ll give them a wink and a smile in return) and some women aren\u2019t sure how to react when they first see me. Teenagers are the best, since they don\u2019t really care all that much about my hair status. This experience has made me realize that I want to help change the stigma of being a cancer warrior/ survivor. We are so much stronger than most people realize! I will continue to go topless in restaurants, shops, theatres, etc, as often as possible to raise awareness for breast cancer. Our baldness is a badge of honor, it represents our strength and courage while fighting this disease. I\u2019ve reached out to the Look Good Feel Better organization here in The Netherlands to see how I can be an ambassador to help raise awareness and represent breast cancer survivors. We battle hard and have gone through so much in this journey, that it\u2019s time mainstream society regard us as empowered women! Fight on ladies! xx  ",

It's been nearly 2 weeks since my 4th and I'm still so beaten by it. Had blood work done on Friday, and I was below acceptable range with all my numbers. My neutrophils and RBC were way too low. I have to go back on Tuesday morning before beginning Taxol treatments to do more blood work to see if I have improved over the weekend. If not, MO will decide on what to do regarding treatment. Although, I believe she wants to keep me on schedule. So, we'll see if there are any options. I've been able to maintain a steady weight since beginning chemotherapy. However; I'm not feeling like wanting to eat that much. And trying to stay hydrated is a challenge. Water tastes so much like chemo drugs. Yuck! Thank goodness for green tea. At least that still tastes like tea. Sending you lots of positive vibes, though I wish I could do more. Stay positive. I know you are! It's not easy, but a strong mind will get you through.

No need to continue with this kind of suffering. On a happier note, side effects have lessened this 2nd time around. Hoping to continue this trend for as long as possible.

For me personally, I enjoy all of the different sauna methods. Steam is great for skin. Finnish or dry sauna heats up the air to a very warm temperature, therefore; sometimes it may feel a bit too much. Since infrared is more direct, the temperature to begin sweating is at a lower setting and is more effective and easier to handle if you\u2019re not accustomed to saunas. At my gym, we have dry and steam saunas and for the dry sauna, I usually would only sit for about 5-6 mins at a time with quick cold shower to cool down and then repeat 2 more times. Onco nurse advised limiting each sit to 5 or so mins. During AC treatments (2 weeks cycle), I usually sauna on day 12 of treatment. And now that I\u2019ve been on Taxol, I\u2019ve only gone once after the very 1st treatment. Have been so sick that I haven\u2019t had energy to gym in past 3 weeks. I do believe sauna helps me to feel healthier and better. I\u2019ve heard that some people, will go every day. Though, that seems extreme. I think going 2 or 3 times a week is a great way to detox especially after chemotherapy. I\u2019ve read that keeping the body at a warm temperature helps to fight off cancer. Not sure how much of that is backed up with science. But if it doesn\u2019t hurt me to sauna, and because I do feel so rejuvenated afterwards, I find it worthwhile",

As I'm reading it appears that the effects of this experience doesn't end when we finish the last round of chemo. The road to recovery back to \u201cnormal\" is slow. And it also seems the psychological aspect of everything we've been through may be just as difficult to work through. So, even though we are done with active therapy, I believe we are only just beginning to discover our new path in this journey. I have 2 more rounds of Taxol to go! And will be very happy when it's all done. Mary, great to hear that you're at the gym often. In my case, it helps keep me going and managing fatigue. Plus, it gets me out of the house and involving myself with the rest of the world. I tend to get depressed when left with only my thoughts. I keep saying I'll try yoga. Going to put that on my list to start after Taxol. Kber and Becky, sounds like recovery PFC is a slow process. Mentally and physically. I'll try not to rush myself back into the swing of things. Especially since I feel like I've been at a standstill since the beginning of all of this. I'm already eyeing some tournaments in June. Though I have no expectations. I just really miss being active and the rush of competition. Hope everyone is recovering well. xx",

It\u2019s crazy how every little detail can just soundoff alarm bells. Had nearly the same thing last week when mamma (breast) care nurse had a follow-up due to continued pain where reconstruction site along scar line sits. There is a little lumpy tissue that has never gone away since surgery in September and it\u2019s increasingly become painful. She recommended me to see radiologist to do an ultra sound, just in case we missed something. Automatically, I imagined the worst, but radiologist didn\u2019t see anything unusual, so we assume it is nerve related. Happy that there isn\u2019t anything suspect, but not happy that the pain has not gone away since surgery. May have to see a pain management specialist if this does not improve after chemotherapy. Talked with onco nurse this afternoon and she confirms that they will go with PICC line instead of port-cath. It\u2019s what they prefer in my case. Either way, am relieved to not get poked about for future bloodwork and infusions. Nanette, not sure I\u2019m looking forward to having some sort of catheter line dangling around. Will be a lovely accessory to go with bald head for spring time. Wish I were auditioning for new sci-fi movie 😁. That\u2019ll really leave an impression!  ",

Looking forward to being \u201cregular\u201d again. While on AC, because of all the anti-emetics, constipation was the game. But then on Taxol, flu like symptoms with 2 rounds of antibiotics, it switched to the extreme opposite. About 2-3x a day! Was seriously having a difficult time with Taxol! And now, with prednisone, happily, it\u2019s somewhere in the middle. Not quite \u201cnormal\u201d, but thankfully, not the extremes. Keep the photos coming.

And I would agree that having AC+T (16 rounds of treatment) or any other chemotherapy regimen after surgery and radiotherapy is exhausting. I found surgery (breast conserving) with immediate reconstruction (latissimus dorsi flap) physically challenging. There was a bit of pain and limited use of arm/shoulder the first couple of weeks since opting for immediate recon work. Took about 6-8 weeks to have 80% of shoulder mobility. And being an advid competition golfer it was very difficult having to cancel my last championship due to recovery. Radiotherapy was not so bad, except for the fatigue at the end of treatment. Took nearly 3 weeks to regain normal energy level. But adjuvant chemotherapy is a whole new level of masochism. Not that anyone derives any pleasure from chemotherapy, just that it is a necessary evil. I've only had 3 rounds, yet I'm already feeling the cumulative effects of it. Can only imagine how it will be further on. I'm just past the halfway mark through this process; chemotherapy is by far the most difficult climb to reach the mountain top. Had I a choice; I may have elected to do chemo first. But none of this is easy, regardless of where we begin this marathon. Making it to the finish line is where I continue to stay focus.

Anxious, congratulations on finishing chemotherapy, and a well deserved vacation is in order! Everything you\u2019ve described is everything I\u2019m going through. Terrible stomach cramps, followed by diarrhea (sorry, tmi), low grade fever of 99.1-100.4 degrees with night chills. And constant feeling of having the flu. Body aches, muscle pain, weak legs and a hardy chest cough. Taxol is definitely a test of physical and mental strength. Nanette, sending you lots of positive vibes for upcoming mastectomy. I really miss my sauna sessions. MCBaker, I know you mentioned about not sweating out the necessary chemo. Generally I go at the very end of treatment cycle a day or two before next treatment. I\u2019m sure by then, it\u2019s already circulated throughout the body and getting rid of the remaining toxins really felt healthy. The concern with PiCC line is that the moisture/sweat could cause infection. If I could figure a way to keep the PICC line dry, then it would be okay. Currently, showering is a challenge. But, I usually dry everything off immediately. Taking a nice hot bath also sounds great, but have been told that\u2019s also off limits. I understand undergoing chemo isn\u2019t supposed to be fun. But if the little joys in life are also taken away, how are we to keep plugging on? I guess, knowing that I will keep fighting through no matter how challenging or difficult it is, will give me a sense of accomplishment that only those of us who\u2019ve gone through this will ever truly understand.

My tumor was 2.2 with no lymph involvement (stage II, grade 2) and BC subtype was ER+95%, PR+95%, HER-, hence; Lumpectomy with radiotherapy and then hormonal therapy would have been my treatment path. But I was adamant on a genomic test to see if chemotherapy would be necessary. And it came back high risk. I\u2019m not sure if my age or any other factors came into play, but MO felt certain chemotherapy was to follow after radiotherapy. I asked for a 2nd opinion from Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital, which is the top cancer institute in the Netherlands, and the specialist confirmed that chemo was indeed the right decision. Did your oncotype DX provide a TailorDX to help with intermediate score? I\u2019m not familiar with oncotypeDX, but I thought I read that somewhere. I\u2019m not sure how much of a real percentage chemo would lower the risk factor for recurrence vs. the risk of not doing chemotherapy, but being quite fit and healthy and under 50, I concluded that perhaps this was the right choice for me. As for chemo after radiation treatments, I asked RO if that was cause for concern, but she said that it\u2019s not so much a factor. Radiotherapy is locally targeted and chemo is systematic (whole body). I began chemo almost 5 weeks after radiation, but that was due to waiting for 2nd opinion. I believe 2-3 weeks was the original start date. The only complaint of chemo after radiation is from my surgical site. Chemo may add further irritation/pain to an already beat up breast tissue trying to heal. Not gonna lie, chemotherapy can be exhausting. Although, I\u2019m managing through the side effects alright so far. Going to the gym at least once or twice a week really helps. I believe anyone who is active and relatively healthy regardless of age, would be able to handle chemotherapy. Though, that\u2019s just an opinion. Your MO would be the best person to discuss benefits vs risks specifically for you. Everyone is different. Hope I\u2019ve been able to offer a little bit of insight.",

I had radiotherapy about 5 weeks after surgery. Just as I was beginning radiation, my MammaPrint results came back, and chemotherapy was necessary. I was 12 weeks post surgery when we began chemo. Your MO will be able to advise you regarding the recovery time between radiotherapy and beginning chemotherapy. Normally, chemotherapy is most effective within 90 days of surgery or 120 days of diagnosis. But definitely check with MO to help decide on what is best for you. Have you done a genomic test such as OncotypeDx or MammaPrint to help decide on the benefits of chemotherapy? In my case, chemotherapy was part of my treatment path because of my MammaPrint results. I had also sought a 2nd opinion regarding MammaPrint results to confirm that chemo was necessary. ",
