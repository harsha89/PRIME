After a biopsy, I was told the cancer had spread to both sides and started back in chemo. Now, I am scheduled next week to remove all the lymph nodes on both sides. Does anyone have suggestions for me as far as having a quick recovery from this, things to do or not do, etc.? Log in to post a reply",
