So, yes, you can ask for a biopsy, but unecessary ones can produce a whole new set of problems. ",

You might simply have nothing more than hormonal changes going on and busy breasts like I have, and many other women.  I do think from what you have written, that you need to find out if your issues are natural changes or changes that indicate something?  You mention dusty, that the doctors are focussing less on what you are feeling?  Are you suggesting they are not listening to you? Their job is to focus on what is going on, not what you are feeling, (a huge problem, yes) but that is out of your control.  Biopsies are indeed, a very necessary tool in ascertaining whether an abnormality is benign or cancerous.  However, a biopsy can also be unecessary, on something that is \"stable\" and benign.  A biopsy is not always necessary on a presentation that has clear indications of benign status, many will say a biopsy is the only way.  I swim against the tide on that one, given what has happened to me.  I was treated inappropiately and counselled badly, even though I researched thoroughly.  I can't understand how you feel, but I can empathise with worry and concern when something is not right.  Go see the surgeon, see what he has to say, if he finds an abnormality, (I see an abnormality as something that should not be there) and if that abnormality presents as a benign finding then, you can insist on biopsy to rule out malignancy.  And have the follows up to check the finding.  Whatever you find, I hope you manage to find some peace, within your mind, as opposed to all this worry. ",

I would definitely state that it is a hormone issue, given what I have been through, down to our monthly cycles...  As the cause of breast cancer is still unknown, there are only risk factors, it is hard to define whether cyclical pain increases risks...  These hormones, funny old things aren't they?  Thank you for your kind wishes... ",

That all sounds absolutely appalling to me, given that I have had nothing with my breasts apart from an infection in the same breast in 2003 which was treated with anti biotics and successfully.  I am not a big woman, or big breasted, average I would say, 36B, and my friend spotted me rubbing my underarm back in September, which is what alerted me to the GP.  From the mammogram that I had, I have mixed density breasts, which is normal for a woman of my age.  I have read about fibroadenomas to know and be assured of their benign status and am not concerned about cancer being there, I fully trust the medics who have been dealing with me, but I just have a nagging feeling about the pain, the FA is towards my underarm in my left breast, and while not massively bruised, at all, (I don't bruise easily) there is a slight yellow mark.  All normal signs that were given on the aftercare sheet.  I too, am now surprised that they didn't remove it via the biopsy route, the needle aspiration came back inconclusive...  The radiolaogist went in twice with the core needle, and took two lots, so am wondering if anything left.  On the US, it came back as 9mm by 4mm, on the biopsy it came back as 11mm by 3mm. again not concerned only a mm, but I suppose in this, every mm counts!  Am leaning towards removal, I believe there is a low threshold for removals at the clinic I attend.  If they remove, do they then assess the mass that has been removed?  So many questions, but it does help to write it all down and I will be asking on Monday, but hey, if I can get some \"back door\" information then I would be eternally grateful. ",

Have a nice holiday, where are you?  Just booked ours this morning.  We are naffing off South, to a cottage, with my dog, at the end of this month. ",

Would removal eliminate the need for further screening as in the UK, screening is only from the age of 50.   2. Am I over reacting in wanting this out?  While I am not a person who has had any ill health at all, apart from a cold, and as the mass is not so large, (1mm by 3mm) would it be wise to opt for a removal purely because of my age and to avoid anxiety about it being there.   3. What is the pain all about?  More noticable since the biopsy and while I have clinic on Monday, to discuss results, and will be mentioning it, is is normal for pain a week after biopsy?  Log in to post a reply",

I have almost begged to my husband that I wish I could have something to take it away. Truly, I am with you on that. But, you will get through it, just keep an eye on the pain, monitor and enjoy the times of relief, when you are pain free. I had never heard of fibro cystic breasts before my experiences with the clinic and this forum, so we have learned something and that can only a good thing.  The link is very informative, helps a lot and once you have a name for something, it does make it easier to accept.  We are not told here in the UK, that we have this and we are told to go away and it is nothing, when it is very much something that we have to live with. I am back at clinic on Friday and I am hoping that I can get somewhere with this latest mass, that is causing me some worry.  I have been guaranteed an all over ultra sound, which took some procuring after going to PALS, who have been brilliant, given my history up at clinic and the loose ends not being tied up, hopefully they will be now be tied up on Friday, with the ultra sound and I can then move forward and have my concerns addressed as they should be and I can then not see another clinic till I am handed over to national screening at 47.  This is what I am hoping for.  At worst, I will be on six monthly follow up, I am sure I am not on a cancerous route.  But I will be certainly advocating that women are more aware of their breasts and that changes have to be reported.  We don't have that enough in the UK, people are not willing to stand up and ask to be seen when something is not right.  One sentence can change a woman's life.  I have no fibro pain at the moment, only the sharp stabbing pain and the feeling under my arm that is there, all the time, not on the run up to my menstruation and that's what I want investigating.  Now I am, I can relax and deal with whatever the outcome is.  Enjoy your last few days, in peace and come home relaxed and ready to deal with your boobs, pain and all. Hugs to you. Wilson. ",

All cyclical.  I have had lumps and bumps, that have come and go.  Having lumps and painful breasts is part of being a woman, there is little we can do about that.  It is part of me, I manage it quite well and I am used to it, as unpleasant as it is.  I have no idea if I have fibrocystic breasts, but I know they have hurt and it is part of my cycle, now am in menopause, there are times I want cut them off myself.  The first sign of pregnancy for me, was sore boobs, how I knew.  As soon as my period arrives, the symptoms disappear and I have had a couple of weeks of relief before it starts again.  For some time now, and those around had noticed it, I kept going under my arm, and my friend was the first one who alerted me to the fact that I kept doing it.  I asked my husband if he had noticed me doing it, and he said yes, but never thought anything else about it.  It was subconscious, however, when my friend picked up on it, and asked me why, I said I could feel a discmfort and that I felt as though something was there.  I eventually went to the doctors who stated she could feel a couple of lumps and on I went for the round of testing.  I won't bore you with the details of that, it is long and tedious and currently my treatment is under investigation here in the UK.  My point to all of this, is, and I am sure many women would agree with me.  We women, should know our bodies.  I knew this discomfort was not cyclical, I knew that it had been there for sometime and it took a while for my brain to catch up with me.  The fact you are convinced that you have something there and feel that you are not being listened to, is distressing in itself.  The fact that you are nursing, could be related to this, however, and the possibility is that, all the medics you are seeing are simply putting it down to your breasts being busy and lactating. Hence, why you are being sidelined. So, stop poking yourself, as it can make things worse, but give it a couple of months and study your breast changes, make a journal of events, check yourself once a month, keep calm and see if there is a pattern.  One of the reasons, why I felt frustrated at the beginning is that I wasn't getting any answers from the medics, because I was not asking the right questions. Educate yourself on your breasts and your body and see if there is a pattern of events. Then, in a couple of months, or so, if there is something there, you have proof, get to a doctor, armed with information, not just on breast cancer, but on the benign conditions that are out there, and if you go in looking as though you mean business, then you will get somewhere. As women here, will tell you, there are many myths out there, about breast cancer, and one of them is that, pain is a good sign of it not being malignant. Bollocks, there are thousands here who have had pain prior to diagnosis. A lump or thickening can be any number of benign conditions also, so don't convince yourself you have cancer, when you don't know. You owe it to that little one, to ensure you are healthy, do the legwork yourself, help yourself, educate yourself and ask any questions here that you will get answers to, nobody minds. I hope that helps you.",

You certainly haven't annoyed me, I hear you girl, frustration is the pits and if we feel that we are not being listened to, well, we do blow up!  No, you don't need to prove what you have, at all, that's the doctor's job! That said, a doctor's job is to rule out malignant possibilities, not look for them.  They are human beings, they feel like we do, they bleed like we do and if a patient is distressed and claiming they have something that they cannot see evidence of, then they will too, become frustrated. But  why should we live with chronic pain and irritability, I am with you.  When I was first going through the mill with the round of appointments, I convinced myself of all sorts, our minds run riot, when it was something very simple and easy and not at all concerning, although I am being monitored, this is the best result that could have come through all of this.  I asked for a second opinion from my GP, I received this, no problem, she found me another breast consultant as I didn't feel reassured with the first one I saw.  I read somewhere on here, I think it was Marie, who had written it, to a lady who was convinced she had breast cancer, on finding a lump, now we all think that, I did and am sure am not alone there.  But as Marie pointed out and I thought it was brilliant, if we think we have something, and we look up that particular problem, then what we read will be fitting to what we think have.  It is about mind control and bringing ourselves back to the here and now, you don't know what is causing these awful symptoms, and you need the medical profession to try to find out what is going on. Of course you can rant here, I don't think of all the 1000's of members mind in the slightest, remember, they too, have been in your position, the frustration, the pain, the worrying, the wondering...  But self diagnosis, is like a child wielding a sword, dangerous, and takes us to places where we lose all control, I have seen it, experienced it.  I would spend days, worrying, reading until my hubbie ticked me off, he was being affected by it, friends were avoiding me...  I have been where you are, by all means rant, by all means shout it out, but people will chime in and advise you, that's the risk you run when you're on a public forum...  I have a surgeon now, who is just fantastic with me, and he stated to me, that one sentence from a medical staff member can change a person's life, he's very aware of that and we get on great and he has my ultimate trust, in how he guides me through each and every step and sometimes, I have had to wait for him to call me back, but now I know that when he can, he will get around to returning my call.  I think, from what you have written, you lack confidence in your GP and this is contributing to what already is a very worrying time for you.  This is why I suggested speaking with practice manager.  Write them a nice letter, sod the 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle, to the practice manager, asking for a telephone conversation with her/him or even better a meeting, to get your points and needs across.  The GP and the surgery are bound by a duty of care, and if you are failed in that, then you have every right, as a patient on the NHS to be heard. ",

I hope you get good results from your own consultation. ",

If you're going to read only on breast cancer, then you may do a great job of convincing yourself you have breast cancer, before a diagnosis.  Because you are at pre-biopsy stage, then you are likely thinking that your lump is malignant.  I can happily tell you, that there are also many benign conditions that are also out there and if I have learned anything from my time on the same journey you're about to undertake, it is that, looking on the bleak side, is not good for my or my family's mental state.  I also, know why, many people think that if they prepare themselves for the worst news, then if they get good news they will feel better, and if it is bad news, then they have somehow prepared themselves for the event.  Thing is, as many women will tell you, who have been diagnosed with a malignant path, is that nothing could have prepared for how they feel, when this happens.  There are lots of women here, who will hold you up through this time, of wondering, waiting, anxious time.  You can vent your anger, frustrations here, if that's what you need to do, by all means, but try not to think the worst and if you're going to research, then choose your research wisely. ",

More groggy than anything from the anaesthetic.  Nothing to apologise for, you're scared and anxious, I was too.  Let us know how it goes, your results, and how you are tomorrow.  Big hugs. ",

It is recommended that women in their 40's have them removed, due to them being a blocker during screening.  They can also disappear, so depending on your age, after biopsy, you may well be advised to leave alone and watch and wait.  No point having surgery unless they become a problem. ",

I took my dressing off after five days, I felt fine, was driving again after 48 hours and apart from a couple of co-deine, all was well, till about two weeks after and this happened.  I did experience like a knitting together, if that at all makes a sense, from within, it sort of felt busy...   Sending you good healing thoughts, Jaye. ",

Get the lumps checked to be on the safe side, and good luck. ",
