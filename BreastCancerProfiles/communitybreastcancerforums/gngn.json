Jpann39, Im afraid, we r quite far away, at least 3-4 hours by driving, but we can talk by phone, Ill be extremaly glad..Thank you again.. Now, my stuation update: They ve decied make liver biopsy and at the same  time, to insert the port.. Port process was really painless, but took long time around 2 hours. And I wake up in middle of the operation because couldnt breath in.. Staff and MD says, all shows my oksijen level was great, but I dont know, I really  highly feel out of oksijen. And It countinued all night slightly.( Most probably allerjic reaction, I didnt ask my doct, yet) Thats why, they didnt do liver biopsy, most probably it will be next week. And other hand, my onc. is waiting for me for Avastin+ Zometta monthly treatment. But Im not sure to get Avastin this time, because of I had some drug( most probably Avastin) reaction last time.. Lets see whats waiting me next week..  Is there any sister here had similar problem as me? Thank you for listening.. Big hugs all of you",

Im really confusing and sad so far.My b,c metast. to my bones 2 years ago. We ve started the treatmeant,( radio,zometta tamox,/ arimidex, zoladex, and avastin). Since last summer, I feel great. But,last month we all family get a virutic sickness more than 2 weeks. After this sickness, I push my oncolog. to check me again with pet / cat scan because I got very bad symptomps during the virutic sicness period. My oncol. told me, *You r condition is perfect, blood works, liver enzeyms, wbc, is in super range, even t.m still reducing trending, so I dont need a pet/cat scan for yuo* But I insist to check those scan. And they did last week. Whats the results? I ve 13 met in my liver, mets some of my lenf nodes, mets to my both overian, but no new met on bones.  I called other dr in CA,( Im in WA ) and asked him, and he told me it might a primary overian cancer to met to liver.. OMG,Im really shoked. How all of these happens just suddenly while everthing was going well.. My last pet and cat scans was 7-8 months ago.. and I start to feel very good again after virutic sickness. They will do liver biopsy this week most probably.. Im really very sad, and can not understand whats happening?? With my best wishes all of you Log in to post a reply",
