I started getting pain in my right breast and was diagnosed with a small (2.1cm) PASH. The PASH & lactation were not related.Â  If it wasn't causing me any pain I would have left it, but chose to have it removed 7 weeks ago. Everything was going fine, but this week the pain has come back. I am being checked in a few days to see if it has come back. Does anyone know anything about the recurrance of PASH?? I haven't been able to find anything online. Gil how are you doing??",
