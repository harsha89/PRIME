I have good days and bad days but my support system gets me through. Try to relax, trust your health care providers and come here.

Day 2 I was still woozy and foggy. Today, day 4 I still feel foggy and my vision is just a tad off (don't feel comfortable to drive ) but eating fine with maybe a little gas, indigestion a little (remedied by some peppermint tea), and able to play with my kids more , clean up a little around the house, and helped make dinner with my hubby. I know dose 2,3, and 4 may bring new challenges but I'm just taking one step at a time. I did buy some cute hats though and am getting my hair cut short Wednesday and some acupuncture on Thursday so I will be ready for the challenges.",

I have been out of breath more easily and just have these general aches and pains all over especially in my chest which make me concerned all the time but per my CT and bone scan there is nothing there. I almost think it's anxiety and maybe I need something for that. I have to take imodium every day to make sure I don't get stomach cramps and loose stools. It is so daunting to think I have to endure 10 more Taxol some with Taxol alone and some with Herceptin and Perjeta.

I layed in a ball for about an hour until it passed. I had called my MO and spoke to the nurse about changing it suring the week. Well to my surprise they still had benedryl on call for today but less of it. In any case my infusion nurse was a godsend and contacted the doctor before giving me the benedryl and they switched it to Zyrtec. I was fine the entire time. I am home now feeling pretty good with the exception of some mild fatigue but feel fully functional for the most part. Whew what a relief..also I found out that I had a loading dose last week so will get less of a dose for the next 10 and Herceptin with Perjeta only every 3 weeks which I thought I would have weekly so it was somewhat of an easy day today.",

After that I will have 3 or 4 weeks off then will have a bilateral mastectomy with about 2/3 lymph node removal from my right underarm and will continue with herceptin every 3 weeks for up to the year mark from when I started it. I get nuropathy from time to time but notice it mainly when I am sitting around. If I get up and get the blood flowing it gets better and goes away. My head hair is starting to grow back and is so super soft and dark when I had reddish light brown hair before. My eyebrows on the other hand are sort of falling out and growing in at the same time and I've lost just about all of my lashes. I have noticed I have become more achy especially in my hip bones and my feet bones and in my sternum and in between my ribs. I take Aleve for this and it helps. Also I take immodium twice a day to ward off the horrible stomach cramps and diarrhea I was getting at the beginning. I still have a bowel movements at least once a day so I'm not too worried about constipation. I also notice with Taxol I feel a little nauseous for one or two days. I take a comparing for that and it helps. I have not had any nail issues. I use OPI nail Envy and so far so good. A word about the premeds...on my first taxol they gave me 50 MG of benedryl iv and I could not handle it. I was dizzy, shaky, nauseous. It was not good at all. I had read that some women get a zyrtec tablet instead so the next time I went in I requested that and felt much better. Now I just get Pepcid iv, 1 steroid pill, and the zyrtec and am fine. No allergic reaction or anything. So if the benedryl bothers you talk to your MO about zyrtec. That's about all I can think of for now. I am so tired after not sleeping well for nearly 2 weeks.. pretty hurricane prep had me stressed then we spend 3 days at my brother in laws to ride the storm out, 2 days at my in laws and 3 days at our house with no power. Luckily a friend of my husband's lent us a generator so we could run a window ac unit but we all had to sleep in one room on couches and air mmattresses. It was like camping out of our house. I was thankful only because it could have been much worse. We still had a house to come home too with minimal damage only to a fence out back. Take care ladies. I can't wait to ring that darn bell. I wanted to make a banner to run through but thought that might be a little too much.",

A lot more fatigue, aches and pains etc. Out if 16 chemo treatments I've taken though only 4 more to go. I see the finish line finally. I cannot wait t ring that bell loud and proud. Some days I feel like a beast like nothing stands in my way and other days very vulnerable like I want to take a break from treatment but I know I once I'm done with chemo I will get a few weeks break before surgery. Also my head hair and armpit hair are growing back. It feels like the softest baby hair ever. My eyebrows ad all fallen out but new hairs were growing at the same time. Just sort of looks like I shaved them real short. All in all though I'm doing pretty good. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend. My youngest son turns 7 today so we will be having a party tomorrow for him.",

I have huge knots in my left shoulder blade causing my neck to hurt and since my last Taxol with Herceptin and Perjeta last Friday I get these headaches. I also have been sleeping terribly. I wake up often have a hot flash, rip covers off, freeze put covers on, fall back to sleep for a while and then this goes on all night long. I know these side effects may subside after chemo but I feel like I'm getting my butt whooped. I'm so excited to finish but know that surgery and possible radiation lay ahead.

Coming out of anesthesia was rough as I was really nauseated. That settled down though after a few shots of Zofran in my iv. I came home yesterday and have been settling in. I am definitely in some pain but pain meds take the edge off. I took my first shower today with the help of my husband and I cried.

You will feel a poke and maybe a burn but only for a second or two but then nothing. Then they will insert the needle that will take the samples. When the samples are taken it sort of sounds like a staple gun but it doesn't hurt. Mine were a little sore the next day but it depends what you do for work. They don't want you lifting anything more then a gallon of milk and no strenuous activity. If you have a desk job I think you would be fine to return the next day. Also it depends on where you go. Some get results in 2 days or so and sometimes it may take longer. Good luck I hope everything goes great for you.",

Well I did not tolerate the benedryl well at all. I was super shaky, fast heartbeat, dizzy, nauseous...so two infusion nurses sent emails to my doctor and I will be leaving a voice mail for him to change to zyrtec..all n all I was at the infusion clinic for about 6 hours or so. Took a nap in the car while hubby drove and went home to bed. The infusion nurse said all was dripped very slaw the first time to make sure I did not have any allergic reactions to anything and that the following treatments will be dripped a little faster.

Did you still have the surgery, and possibly radiation? I will be asking my doctor these same questions as I simply read the results on my patient portal...I am also HER 2 positive which weighs heavily on any decisions I make on this journey..I am so excited that chemo worked so well but am apprehensive for some reason to jump for joy for some reason.. I am so relieved though to see how my body responded..loos like most of us are just about done with chemo if not all and are doing pretty well for the most part..I will also have to have my gallbladder removed due to a polyp they found during an ultrasound so hopefully that is nothing..I have a little muscle fatigue leftover, and some rib pain here and there but overall I feel pretty good..",

I finished 26 out of 30 radiation treatments today and finish next Thursday. I told the techs today I hope I never see them in that place ever again after all this is over but meant it in the most lovingness ways of course. After radiation I have to have my gallbladder removed and then I will still have Herceptin infusions every 3 weeks until the summer. I was thinking of joing the Livestrong program ay the YMCA to gain some strength back especially since I have been having issues with cordingin my right arm since my double in November. I am so thankful to have found this group. I never posted a ton but when I did you all were so encouraging and to see others were going through the same thing put me at ease in some strange way. Not that I was happy we all were feeling crappy at times but it was nice to know I was not alone. I cannot wait to put all this crap behind me and to move on with my new normal.",
