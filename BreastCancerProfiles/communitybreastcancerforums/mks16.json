She found out though, we use the same computer and she is a very smart cookie so she saw some new bookmarks that weren't there before so she asked me straight out whether I had cancer. What I find very difficult is not what I tell her, but what she hears from others. She told me her teacher said that cancer runs in families and now she is afraid that she is going to get it. My mom passed away from cancer 15 months ago, and that is still fresh in her mind as well. She keeps asking me what she can do to make sure she doesn't get cancer... we are all bombarded with \"good\" advice from everywhere, to a 7 year old it sounds like I didn't do something I should've and now I got it. We do have some friends and family members that are survivors, her friend's mother just completed her bc treatment and is doing very well so there are a lot of real life examples I use to show that people can be 'cured'. Still, it is hard because we can't shield our kids from the cruelness of the outside world :/",

Make sure you're there on time, because they're so efficient, your time slot will be taken up by someone else if you're not there on time - happened to me today, parking lot was full today and took forever to find a spot.",

Unfortunately, I had to have another drain put in, just as I was well on my way to recovery and wearing regular clothes, but hopefully that is not too far off.  Mdg, why can't you go on treadmill? Its snowing here as well, even if I was confident enough to walk outside in snow and ice, there's no way I can get full winter equipment on, due to drains being in the way. I thought I might try treadmill this weekend, but now I don't know. I didn't have reconstruction yet, maybe its different for you as the recovery is slower? The exercises I got bore me. I found that I already do most of them by doing some of the regular housework, like gently scrubing the bathtub, or emptying the dishwasher and putting lighter dishes on the top rack in cupboards... does that count as exercise?",

As chemo was never in question for me, I didn't give it too much thought, but now, reading all your posts I wonder. The idea that \"different methods produce different results\" scares me.  Why even get tested then, if some TN might turn out to be ER+/PR+ when different method is used? I knew about slight variations in results, so if one IHC method returns me as weakly positive in 30% of tumour, then its possible that another method would return moderately positive, or in 25% or 50% of tumour. Not in 95% and not strongly positive. That just blows my mind. Does that mean I might be HER2 + and could benefit from Herceptin, but because of the method used I am considered negative and am not getting all the benefits I could?

My surgeon said radiation might be required if they considered my node as positive. She suggested we go for another surgery and remove 10 or more, and if they all come back as negative radiation won't be required. With micromets, there's a 13% chance that cancer might be present in other nodes as well, but with additional removal, there's also an increased risk of lymphedema (about 10% increase). Furthermore, if more than four nodes came back as positive, I will have radiation for sure, which will then double the risk of lymphedema (total increase of 20%). I opted for additional surgery, mostly for my peace of mind...",

My right side, prophylactic MX, is healing wonderfully, the drain got taken out today and there's almost no pain and no swelling. My left side is another story. I also had sentinel node biopsy on that side, and it is very swollen and heavily bruised. The discharge is mostly very dark blood and a lot of clots. Some of them are stuck in my drain bulb and I can't get them out. Every time a different home visitation nurse stops by, she can't believe the amount of bruising that is now extending to the bottom of my left hip! I am not in too much pain, but the swelling that is right under my left axilla is uncomfortable and limiting my movements. The left breast area is also swollen, to almost an A cup size! Looking at the numbers alone, the drain could've come out today as its draining less than 30 cc in 24 hours, but the dark blood and clots scare me. I assume the swelling is because the clots have clogged up the drain portion that is under my scar?  Did anyone else have similar experience? I talked to my PS earlier this week, she thinks its too late to open up the surgery site because most of the blood has already spread all over my left side and it doesn't seem like there's any other internal bleeding. I am seeing her again in a week.  Best wishes to everyone who is awaiting surgery and speedy recovery to those who are currently recovering from it.",
