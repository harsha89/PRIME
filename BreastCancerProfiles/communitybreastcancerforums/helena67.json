But, as I recall, Luminal A designation is for those tumors that are very strongly ER positive and PR positive. Usually these tumors then tend to have a lower Ki67, which is a measure of aggressiveness of the tumor. Let's say that a tumor that is 90% ER positive and 80% PR positive with a Ki67 of 8% would be a typical Luminal A tumor. These are also HER2- (negative). I was ER positive but PR negative (<5%) and had a higher Ki67% (high is typically 13% and higher)and I was also HER2+. Thus, I had a typical Luminal B tumor. Basically, Luminal A are the more 'lazy', strongly hormone dependent tumors and Luminal B the more aggressive, but still also hormone dependent tumors. Luminal B will respond more to chemotherapy compared with Luminal A. Hope this helps a little. You are 7 years out! That is great! By the way, as a patient you have the right to get decent answers to your questions from your Onc.... Best, Helena.",

In any case, You probably should first focus on not having pain when you go to sleep. That is probably the most important thing. Otherwise you start thinking about the pain and then you cannot sleep. After many years, I have come to the realization that, for me, insomnia is a learned behavior. What works for me is sleep deprivation. Instead of going to bed, I stay up all night and just watch TV or read a book. After a night or 2 I feel so tired that I sleep fine again (sometimes with the help of a small cognac!). Good luck!",

There are no 'head to head' comparative studies out yet - so we don't yet know if one is more effective that the other. I think at the moment they are all 3 considered equally good. Sometimes patients switch because they tolerate one better than the other. I have been on Femara for about 5-6 months now and tolerate it well. But there are some side effects - for example I notice stiffness in my hands and feet. Sometimes I have some trouble sleeping (although that seems to be on and off). But I have not noticed major hair loss or weight gain for example. One of the most important things to remember is that you don't quite your hormone treatment. I have read several stories and articles that quite many women throw in the towel so to speak after a year or 2. But that really can affect your risk of recurrence. Good luck! Helena.",

I just don't like the way I look at the moment (kind of pale and not particularly 'healthy') and the way I feel (blah). DC Mom, maybe you should go for a second opinion? I think there is no one single right answer to this question at the moment. I had an oophorectomy (based on overian cancer history in my family), so then I thought I might as well take my ovaries out to remove a source of estrogen from the breast cancer. Then, I was immediately put on an AI (Femara) and I am content with that and I don't notice too many side effects (except fatigue but that may be the anemia). However, there is a fairly recent and important Austrian study (the one that also showed a benefit for Zometa). This was a study by Michael Gnant, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January of 2009. In this study, about 1200 premenopausal women were enrolled and it showed that over the course of 3 years there was no difference beween tamoxifen plus lupron compared with an aromatase inhibitor plus lupron. Basically, that all means that there is no clear proof that an AI would be better than Tamox in younger women, so now you see that some women (like myself) get an oophorectomy plus AI, some women (like Everyminute & Bugs) get an oophorectomy and Tamox. Some women opt for only Tamoxifen (which is still the so-called Gold Standard, or Standard of Care in premenopausal women) and finally, some women combine the Tamoxifen with Lupron. As for myself, it is quite possible that after my 5 years with AI are up, that I will continue with tamoxifen. But I don't know that yet. Finally, you also consider that an oophorectomy possibly will have long-term health effects on for example bone health, heart health, effects that are not entirely known. The surgery itself (which can be done laparoscopically) is not a big deal. So, it may be really good if you talk to another Onc about this, maybe someone specialized in breast cancer at a large cancer center. Best, Helena.",

Since you had 2 positive nodes (2 out of 2) it would be wise to remove more to see if there are any additional positive nodes. Normally they try to remove at least (approximately) 10 nodes. It also sounds like you had a fairly large tumor and close to the chest wall - doing a mastectomy then may be a good idea. With positive nodes you probably are going to be advised to have radiation too. Make a list of questions and get them answered. Get a second opinion if you are not comfortable. Good luck! -Helena.",

I wonder if our immune systems are still down and we cannot fight various bugs as well anymore. For example, I have a bronchitis myself - normally, a few years ago, I would get rid of these colds within a day or 2. Take much more time now (plus antibiotics!). Take care!! -H.",

It is not easy dealing with a diagnosis of possible cancer and also dealing with the healh 'system' and the stupid & ignorant people that are part of it. The waiting period is the worst I think. You will feel better once you have all the details of what is going on and you will have a treatment plan. I went through it all over the past year (surgery, chemo, radiation, etc etc) and I feel quite OK and normal now, about a year later. So will you. Regarding the MRI, maybe take something that will make you sleepy and relaxed. (And have someone drive you home!). Of course you don't want to give up! Your disease is likely VERY treatable. Just do it! Take care- Helena.",

For example, a disc problem or a lack of a certain vitamin (just to give you some examples). Also, if they cannot find a nerve or muscular reason for your pain, then they can refer you to an orthopedic surgeon instead, to check out hip bones and joints, etc.  You need to see someone with knowledge in the fields of nerves/muscles/bones on one hand and pain on the other hand. Neurologist would be my first pick. Good luck, don't give up!",
