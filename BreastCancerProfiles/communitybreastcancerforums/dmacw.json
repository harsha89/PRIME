She did show me the report from the mammo and she said they were not looking for anything bad just a lymph node (that she didn't see) She only saw cyst in the same area that mammo was questioning. Ok so I was relieved a bit. I call a friend to tell them and I got silence. He said, thats how my mother got started. They said a cyst. Lets watch it. She said to the doctor \"Does it belong there\"? He said no and she said take it out and it ended up being cancer. She is now a 15 yr survivor. So, there went my happiness. The tech was so upbeat and sure of herself. She said they will probably want to watch the cyst. It it grows or it bothers me they will remove it. I am relieved a bit but need your assistance here. Thanks to all. Log in to post a reply",
