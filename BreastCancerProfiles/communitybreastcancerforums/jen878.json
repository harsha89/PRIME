Mum (now aged 66) was diagnosed with Stage 3 HER2+ breast cancer in 2012, she had a mastectomy, chemo (Taxotere/Docetaxel), radiation therapy and Herceptin, and she has appeared to be cancer free until now. This week she has been diagnosed with metastatic cancer in the lungs, she is breathless and has lost her voice. She is going to have the fluid drained and then the oncologist has advised that the usual treatment would be another 6 rounds of the chemo (Taxotere/Docetaxel) and then Herceptin every 3 weeks for as long as she is alive, possibly in combination with Perjeta - though we live in New Zealand and that drug is currently not funded here. My question is about the chemo drug Taxotere (Docetaxel). When she underwent the chemo therapy in 2012, the Taxotere had a profound affect on her short term memory - causing severe \"chemo brain\" (she can go and see a movie and if you ask her on leaving the cinema what it was about she may struggle to tell you), and it has never really improved since that time. I am concerned that if she has to undergo another round of this drug it will cause even more brain problems, leaving her unable to appreciate or enjoy the time that she has left. Has anyone decided to fight against a metastatic cancer using JUST Herceptin and/or Perjeta and NOT done the chemo drug? If so what has been the experience/success? Or does anyone know anything about the Taxotere (Docetaxel) causing these memory issues and if there is an alternative chemo drug that they believe is better? Any insights much appreciated",
