You have earned the right to cry, throw things, yell/scream whatever it takes to get to the point of turning all those negatives into positives.    My GYN called me to talk and has yet to tell me what the pathology results were - I found out from a nurse navigator.     I got rid of a bunch of negative people that were in my life and telling me their sagas everyday (more stress and I really don't care about their lives) - I have positive people supporting me and I am confident in my team and their abilities.    I live alone and my only child lives out of state - it's hard not having someone to talk to while I'm at home or get a hug.   My surgeon walked out with me after my appointment and gave me a huge hug.     Think positive thoughts and cry whenever you feel like it.",
