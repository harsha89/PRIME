      "Content": "notready wrote: Can anyone tell me about their symptoms before actually being diagnosed with brain mets? My last chemo was about a year ago and I did have chemobrain, which I thought would improve. I seem to be getting worse in the last 5-6 months with focusing, memory, paranoia, etc., although I haven't had too many headaches (I have in the last week but think it's from this horrible stress I am under right now). My doctor thinks it's menopause symptoms too which is possible I guess, but I don't get hot flashes or anything like that. I'm not on Arimidex or any of those as I couldn't tolerate them. Physically I feel pretty good. My vision has been a bit blurry since chemo and I did see the opthalmologist last week. He is seeing me again next week because I had a lot of \"floating pigment\"? that he wants to check out again. I haven't had any brain scans or anything like that at any time. Thanks for any comments you can give. Sue Dx 11/11/2007, ILC, 2cm, Stage IIA, 1/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
