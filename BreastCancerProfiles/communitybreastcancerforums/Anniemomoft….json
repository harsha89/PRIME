Prayers for calm as we all begin our January chemo...was just thinking that there is simply no better time to do chemo than January into spring...let's get this thing done!!!!!! Annie ",

Ok, it is funny to hear about the different PS approach for TEs.  Mine does not overexpand.  I did tell him that I was doing the bands and felt VERY tight across my pecs/foobs.  He told me to stop doing this...basically said we are trying to expand you as you try to strengthen and tighten them.  Working against his work. So, I have stopped my lifting/banding.   Suebee - Will you do the implant on the one side...anything on the other? I have heard of people doing that.  My friend did 350s on both...she looks great, but surprisingly small.  I was thinking that sounded perfect for me...or maybe 400.  Now I am heading (with my PS - strong opinion) to a 475 or 500.  It is that boob greed thing!!! Maria - good god girl, you are a machine!  Really.  I am so impressed with all that you are doing. I keep debating joining a health club, but with work and all the kids activities (tonight we have two different soccer practices, and a hockey, and my 7 year old hanging out, plus homework!).  That has been my ongoing debate...so now I have to motivate my self to do the elliptical, walk, and lift in our house.  The only good thing is that it is close!  The bad thing is that I do not get the energy/motivation from others working out too.   Redsky - hope you are resting easy.  I have a five week wait for my exchange. Can not wait, but am worried about possible infection, since I am so low on my hemogloben.  Looking forward to normalcy SOON! Tonight dinner - chicken stir fry with tons of veggies and little sauce!

Great job to all the January girls!  Amazing that so many are getting it done!!!  Annie ",

I really spent time talking about me and how I like to look.  I am 5'10\" and about 155 lbs.  Size 8 or 10 on both top and bottom.  Shoe size is a 12, but that is another story.  I have an athletic looking body with a mini-muffin top from too many muffins!  He and DH think, architurally, that i could be bigger than my normal 36 A/B.  I used to be, before nursing three babes, a 36C.  So, I am at a 425m, but last week was measured as a 34DD due to the wide expanders.  My TE are 12.5cm, I think.   Anyway, I feel huge.  But really, it is because i have a mega-foob.  One gi-normous foob that extends under my arm.  I hit things with the mega-foob, since I can not feel it.  So weird. Anyway my PS stressed that I need to judge my size (today) based on projection only. Not the current sensation that I have under my arms and across the front.  So, I am trying hard to ignore the rest of the foob and really just look at my projection.  Based on that, if I were to stop fills, he would probably need to use a 450 or 500cc.  I trust him. I just really wanted to understand what I should pay attention to... Now, the visual of the coconuts is alarming.  As you know, it is like round, shooting projections from my chest.   There is no nice takeoff above or below, just a rigid takeoff.  As i drank my one glass of wine, I so wanted my girlfriends to feel the weird edges of it all.  They hesitated...and so did I. I just have to show these crazy things off to someone other than my DH and PS!",

MaryMeg - I have that same loyalty to my kids.  They are very familiar with all types of junk food. It does not help that all my dear friends keep delivering cookies!!!   Amelia - I am on day 16 of TCH.  Hair started falling yesterday.  Strange deal!  I have the vision problem as well.  Does anyone know if the vision returns?  It is hard to watch TV in bed, and I am doing a lot of that lately!  Annie",

Official medal has to go to ck_momma for her heroic efforts.  WOW.  What an amazing story on the day she got her port.  I know that I did not have the energy to do all that.  Your avatar needs to change to WonderWoman! Webu - you and I are on almost the same course (I actually mis-typed this as \"curse\". haha ).  The dosing change is a concern.  My onco is lowering me 15% of my original TCH.  Yikes.  i hope this goes well. I think I am going to look up the original clinical study on TCH, since I can't remember the original patient populiation.  Anyone else lowering the dose (or did already) on their chemo? Sciencegiel - I lost 7 pounds my first 8 days of #1...that is when I ended up back in with fluids and a new anti-nausea regime.  The weight is all back.  :)  Did not take long to get my taste for chocolate, coffee, bread and other \"junk\" back. Anyone have low hemoglobin?  Mine went from a 11.3 to 10.3 to 9.3.  My onco casually said that it is likely I will need a transfusion...when I pushed him he said that it may go back up.  I am now on a multivitamin and have been trying to eat better foods.  For some reason I was grooving on breads, which is not normal for me, post chemo.  Anyone dealing with this?  Had my first night of refreshing sleep last night.  Woke up feeling \"normal\".  Love that feeling, wish I could bottle it up.   Chemo is on Monday.  I am a bit nervous - my new protocol includes decadron pre and post chemo, Emend (any SE on this?),  fluids on day #4...need to pick up some movies.  Not sure when the Real Housewives start again.  They kept me company for chemo #1.   Love to you all out there!

Its does seem so unfair to get hit so recently.  I hope things get stabilized soon.   I am on TCH - Taxotere, Carboplatin, and Herceptin.  I just finished round 3 of 6.  Halfway done!!! My first round was not good.  I had NO pre-meds.  I had aloxi/ativan/benadryl, and the chemo drugs in my chemo drip.  Went home with zofran, compazine and ativan.  Took my meds sequentially, but I did not overlap them, at all. Got behind on my fluids, because I was so nauseated.  Went in on day 8, for more fluids and more anti-nausea drugs.  Here is what I learned.  The drugs act have different actions, so they should be overlapping, take them all if you need to!  Diarhhea needs to be stopped, even though you may have constipation too (that was confusing to me as the constipation was a problem on day 3.  Hives are unique and you should use more benadryl.  Lost 7 pounds in 8 days.  Could hardly walk.  Slept/fidgeted alot.  Finally felt semi-normal on day 12. Here is what they changed for rounds 2-6:  Took chemo down 15% (just got it back up another 5% per my urging).  Premeds: decadron (steroid) and EMEND (love it).  Day of chemo - aloix/ativan/benadryl (half doase so I was not so out of it) and the chemo drugs.  Each day for two days - Emend at home in pill form.  Decadron (4mg) one in am, one in pm for four days. For round 2, I felt absolutely 100% the entire post chemo. worked out, walked the dog, made school lunches at 6:30am, lasted all the way to 11pm for bed. No naps. Ran errands, bugged my family because I did not have enough to do.  This regime really worked...will see about round #3. I am hopeful.  Alos, had I not gone in for round #2, I am sure that I would be feeling awful... I hope this helps.  i do not want anyone to go through chemo like I did for round #1.   Hugs to you and the rest of the chemo sisters out there! Annie ",

He said ...we will see if you need it. He never does the fat grafting til after. It is funny that all are so different in their approach. I am thinking that after next monday (last chemotherapy) that I will need to get this weight off before the exchange. I have never dieted in my life. This will be interesting! I know this sounds strange, but I have been eating so much I think I need help like hypnosis or accupuncture. Has anyone ever tried this? I have been great with working out...it is just the eating. Or, oh no, could it be the chemopause that I am in....just though of that. Crap.",

Rennansus - take care of that incision!!!  I am the incision police. Take it easy.  Maybe that is why having a BMX before Christmas was good for me. I did nothing.  Only shopped and hung around. No exercise.  I had a couple incision problems when i had previous biopsies.  They were a nightmare to deal with...hence the incision police!  Be good. Give yourself a few weeks. I can not remember the details from my PS, but you should ask your PS when he/she thinks your incisions will be healed.  It is the bounce and pulls that can really impact the incisions. Take it easy!!! Sue - can you call your PT instead of waiting. With all this crazy stuff, I am just calling and being a PITA. Why not?  I have the sore thighs, etc. from my wimpy recent exercises.  I am starting to get annoyed with myself. It is strange to feel so tired. It is not even 9pm and I am thinking it is bedtime.  I did not even make it to Target today...and I have a zumba on my list!  Barbara - sounds like we may need a house trade...I would love some nice 70-80 weather...i have to wait til June/July!  Today I did get outside. It was 50.  I picked up dog poo in the snow. It was so precarious, there were layers.  I had to be careful not to sink too far down.  It is definitely an art...picking it up in the melting snow.  Good news, though, I can now see the tops of all five chairs on the patio.  Tabletop is still buried.  I am always shocked that I actually live here!  Pray for strength and energy...I need it this week.  All my warm thoughts for a healthy week for you all!

They transfuse at about 8.5.  So i researched good sources of iron to build it back up. The best I found was on the CDC website.  It lists the iron sources and the milligrams for each product.  I was amazed to see the iron rates in fortified cereal - 18mg in some (which is the daily recommended for a 2000 calorie diet).  With certain types of iron (non-heme, which means not from meat) you need vitamin C (like OJ) to help the non-heme iron absorb.  Anyway, in 5 days, after eating alot of fortified cereals, a lot of beef (not my norm) and taking 18mg iron in my multivitamin I raised it back to 9.7!  You can do it too.  Sorry for this long post....",

I have to tell you that I have been taking too many deep dives into the other discussion boards and frequently find myself in a near panic about the poor prognoses of others. I become so sad and drepressed for these wonderful ladies...to make a long story short, both my oncologist team and my  therapist (new concept for me! never had one before) have suggested I go cold turkey. No more deep dives into the clinical studies, different stages, etc.  So this (and the cold caps site) are now my only two discussion boards I go to....anyone else going through the same?  I love this one and all you wonderful ladies because it is so upbeat and fun, plus the normal day to day drama/traumas.   I am supposed to focus on two things - believing that I am a survivor and getting good daily exercise and nutrition. Period! So, it has been nice not reading all the other sites...kind of like a major break. But at the same time, I feel like I could help others...Oh Well. So, here I am wondering if anyone has been to or knows of a great nutrition class. I am even willing to fly to one, since YES I STILL HAVE SNOW IN MY BACK YARD!!!  I really need to get more education and put a plan in place for my family of five. While on vacation I got a call from my the contact for my exercise study that i am in with the bands - the sponsor changed the study to the extent they are only enrolling NEW patients. Bummer. Now I am out of that study, it was a nice motivation for me.  I am considering re-joining a gym - but this spring brings my 13year old - traveling soccer and a AAA hockey league.  My 11 year old - traveling soccer and volleyball (vball ends soon).  My little one is doing a hockey league until june, just starting kung fu for six sessions.  That combined with church, scouts for two of them, I can not find the me time....and I go back to work in June. Boo hoo.  But exercise MUST be my number one priority.  Any ideas??????  Ok, enough about me...I love to hear about the hikes, Rennansus!  I love that your buns are a-aching.  That is great. I just LOVE that feeling.  Maria - I too am dying to hear about your new June plans. New PS?   My onco just agreed that even with my low iron/hemogloben I can do the exchange  five weeks post chemo, since my numbers should have bounced back by then.  I hope June is for you!  Redsky - I hope things are going ok, sounded like a rough week(s).  I hope you checked things out with your dr. on the stool issue.  If you are taking iron, your stools will be a dark brown/black.  Yes, TMI.   Barbara - good luck on chemo tomorrow. Mine went well. Only one more left to go! It is amazing how fast it goes...blessing and curse. The ending is stressful. Cried with my onco on Monday.   How many do you have left?  I will be thinking about you tomorrow!  Sue - I hope you and hubby get jobs.  Sounds nice to be home together without any worries (with the exception of finding jobs!  stressful!!!).  Your fills sounds like they are going great!  Melanie - 10K.  My god girl.  You are an inspiration. Keep inspiring us...maybe someday I will do the same! Had to start a new parargraph about the COCONUTS.  We were staying at a family resort. I mean family - kids everywhere with parents watching.  The funny thing was that I could not go in the water. I wore my hat low with my dark sunglasses on.  My hubby and I laughed...cuz these coconuts were high and wide. They were gi-normous (to me) and apparently to others. I was amazed how many many outright stared at the cocos.  As if I did not notice!!!!  It was funny. I wanted to say, come with me to that dark corner and I will show you what is really under this cute little suit.... Take care everyone! ",

You are now a chemo veteran.   Suebee - hope you get another fill by the time I get back!  I just tried on more vacation clothes and wow am I big!  But, now I know that big in a TE is much different than big in an implant. THere is so much to learn on this journey! Oh, well. I am going to check out the classes at the place we are going. Between the tennis, swimming, snorkeling, etc. I am hoping to do something I have never done before. Zumba? I will report back!  Rannasus - take those naps. I am planning on scheduling a nap into my day. Maybe on the beach, maybe in a chair, maybe on a floatie.  My onco nurse just yelled at me about planning more down time each day. I think we all need to plan this...ok, I am really bad at down time, but I am trying! Redsky - that is fantastic news about \"no further treatment\". I will drink a coconut drink in honor of this news. So exciting!   Barbara - I hope all is well and you are on the upswing of recovery. Mine took much longer this time. I am hoping you have some great days with the horses and dogs.  We really really want to take our dog to the Keys. Funny how these animals can be so part of the family. THe kids have been kissing him goodbye all morning.  Melanie - that is great to that you are doing the walk/run!  I have to say that these coconuts feel like they will fall off if I run. I need to buy a nice, big old bra.  Good for you for getting out there and getting it done! Silia - Congrats on the walk AND the trainer. How was the trainer? What did you work on? I keep thinking this would be a good thing to do.   Off to exercise and get my day going. Have to hit target before we go (goggles, other misc).  Got all my chemo stuff ready for the day we get back. Now to finish the packing. Q - can I lose the five pounds that I have gained...in the next two days?  :) Happy spring everyone! ",

I am trying to hold on until Monday for my LAST CHEMO. We decided to scrap the plans to get together with a million people and instead will stay home and try to lay low.   Supersally - I love your idea of having Maria whip us into shape.  Ideas, Maria?  Is it possible to do aerobics over the internet???  Anyway, supersally, have a great and relaxing trip out of town. Hopefully you can re-energize! Rennansus - your day sounded dreamy!  I can not wait until I have a day like that.  What a wonderful thing to have all of you snazzed up at once!  I am still worried about your spot that won't heal.  I hope the debridement cream works. I have a NASTY infection on my hand...everyone who see it says \"cover it\" but I am supposed to let it breath. Anyway, I can appreciate wanting something to heal, dammit! Suebee - really, is the hospital all men?????  That must be interesting!  I am trying to imagine that....Changing subjects, I am so in need of new sports bras. The couple I have are laughable...like I am trying to be a Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader.  When I put my t-shirt on over it, I have to laugh, because it seems like such a waste to even wear the sport bra.  So,  what kind of bras are we supposed to be wearing? Help!  Maria - the swimsuit thing is really funny. I hope you are not too rambunctious and they don't fall out!  I found myself constantly looking down because I could not feel anything! It was so weird.  Have a blast with your family.  It is all so much fun.... Annie ",

Too funny on the Xanax comments.

Realizing that I hate sitting on my buns, no exercise, boring stuff.  I am trying to have a good attitude.  The first work call I got was from a work friend - who proceeded to tell me about her SIL in hospice due to BC.  No lie.  All I thought was \"this can not be happening to me.\"  At that point, I said that this is my BC-Free zone.  No stories.  Ughh.  I want to be blissfully home full time. Oh well, next lifetime!

Our outdoor table and chairs are piled high. Just a couple of inches of one chair is visible. It is surreal. Like living INSIDE a snow globe!   Well, I had the cold caps all day - my DH, my dad and one of my best friends from work were there. It was great, because I had my benadryl cut in half, so I wasn't as drowsy.  That great chemo nectar flowed through my bod and killed any bad (and good cells).  Before I left I was even able to do my band eercise.  My 7 year old joined me in the excerise before work. He was so sweet.  It was a long day but good...chugged about 4 liters of water and poured over eating plans to increase my hemogloben again.  I went down to a 9.0.  My onco does transfusions at 8.5.  I am not sure why but the idea of a transfusion freaks me out.  Now, I am going for all protein and iron for the next six weeks. Not my favorite foods.  If anyone has ideas, I am open for them!!! Enough about me!  Redsky- sounds like things are going well.  Keep up the good work. Rennansus - I had the pain pump too...it was a miracle. No pain. Fast recovery. It is all good! Sue - still waiting for the youtube link!  Today I am going to target for some stuff. I was thinking of buying a zumba cd. Any recommendations? I am serious! Maria - how are you doing this morning? Keep pushing the water as much as possible. YOur exercise regime is awe-inspiring.  I am so glad you started this thread.  Thanks. And I think I am going to drop on by for some of your dinners. They sound fantastic.  Last night, we had a prepared meal of short ribs (beef!!!), yummy veggies and brown rice. It was good. Also, I made choco chip cookies.  AND DID NOT EAT THEM!  So far, my lent commitment of no sweets has stuck.  NOW THAT IS A MIRACLE. To more miracles...love you all! Annie ",

IT has taken me a while, because, I like many of you, had a change in the path report.  I went from a stage 0 to a 1A and will now do chemo.  I am not the depressed kind of person, but I spent 5 weeks waiting for surgery thinking that I had hit the jackpot to have just DCIS.  Then, post surgery, I got the clean report that it all looked good - SNB was negative, blah blah blah.  Then, on day three in the hospital, my surgeon suddenly appeared at 6pm.  Should have known something was up.  She shared that there were two tumors within the area of DCIS - one was 4mm, the other was 9mm.  15 mammograms, countless biopsies, MRI, clip in the are of the DCIS and they still did not see the other tumors.  What a bummer.  But, now I completely understand what the term \"dense breasts\" means...they can not see a darn thing.  Literally.  I liken it to watching a snowstorm through a window at the airport and you can see the 747s coming in for a landing, but you can not see the 3 small planes that crashed.  Somehow, this needs to be changed.  I did talk this through with my Drs. and all agreed that this is exactly the case, the radiologists CAN NOT SEE.  So, they give you a negative mammogram with a single line disclaimer  \"despite extremely dense breasts.\"   So, I have been trying to come to terms with the new news.  It has taken a while to wrap my head around this...I sort of have felt like an idiot in that I did not understand this small detail. But, I think I am finally getting my positive mojo back.  Finally!   I am thankful that we have this wonderfully simple and straightforward option called surgery for BC.  Chemo is another incredibly wonderful option, too.   And, hair is kind of overrated.  I am lying on this one...as my 7 year old cried - \"no bald mommy\".  My others - 11 an 12 - have reminded my over and over that hair grows back.   Visi, Westielve, Megan, and all the rest of the sisters, here's to a wonderful and healing filled 2011.  We are going to collectively kick BC in the butt!

Please pray for the snowplowers so that the surgical team can get there. Oh, yeah, and so that we can get there, too! Had the SN injection at 3pm.  For me it was a non-event, a paper cut is more painful!    I am hoping that I will get some sleep.  Love to all you sisters that are reclining in your recliners, making small strides and large.  We are linked together and I so appreciate being with you all this past month.  Annie",

I did spend a month strengthening my core with yoga - especially focusing on the should flex since you have to lie flat while in surgery.  Seemed to help. I did feel strong!!!  My wish for the January crew is to talk to your team.  Get a plan that is consistent with your wishes.  Ask for what YOU want.  It is your body, and frankly your dime, too! All my love to you all!  Stay strong....talk to you all on the other side of this all.    Annie ",
