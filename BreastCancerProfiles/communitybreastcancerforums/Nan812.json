I bought a new scarf that day just in case cuz I was a first timer...went to the ladies room...ran my fingers thru my hair...here comes the walking dead!!... it came out in handfuls!...It wouldn't stop (and I had just shampooed that morning) I was filling up the trash!!...my eyes were filling with tears... I couldn't get the scarf on without pulling loose more hair...a angel walked up and said...\"let me help you\" she tied it on, it looked great..then when I told my daughter about what happened we laughed our heads off on what a site I must have been...we still laugh about it...I wish you much better luck than me :)",

I kept thinking bout the poor cleaning lady, she must have thought someone changed their identity in there...and the ladies walking past must have thought I was contagious...and when I got home and shaved the rest, I thought yup kinda funny :) I have to admit that I'm typically very vain and I know just what you mean about liking how you look and feeling better. I couldn't wear a wig, my head was to tender and I missed my eyelashes the most. Something told me that this was just part of it and if I was gonna pull off this new look I better act like it doesn't bother me. I know, it's a goofy way to think and I'm so sorry if any thing I've said bothered you. I sincerely hope you don't loose a strand and that you breeze right thru this.

I'm sorry that wasnt a happy story but never take your love for granted....tell them every day how much they mean to you and how much you appreciate their love and friendship....that is what i fear for my husband, to be left alone when he thought he had a friend he could count on....i would definitely haunt that bitch then..lol please post those pics....lets see how true love grows p.s. mic, lets meet up in heaven and haunt any snakes going after our hubbies (that would be a fun way to spend our waiting time, and shine our love on our sisters still battling this disease) we can look after our babies and their babies too till we meet again......p.s.s..how is hubbys' foot?...",

What do you think? is it worth a 2 hour drive? ) So I came across a ted x talk and a doc all speaking of end of life fasting...it sounds like it would be much more comfortable and be less drawn out...EOL meds are not a problem to get i guess...Im going to do a lil more research on it....a long drawn out hospital stay would drain my familys funds so bad I would fear that they would lose the house...not a peaceful thought.",

From what I understand about doing it before your body does...it seems your body wants you to experience the same ease of passing (natural endorphins, less fluid=less death rattle and more comfort in breathing, less going in=less coming out) need to read a lot more about it. found a you tube called \"dying well for busy people\" that is very interesting but i still cant find the ted x talk about the professor...sorry. . .thank you all for sharing....it seems like I'm missing something...I'll just keep reading till it all makes a lil more sense to me...thanks again (:",
