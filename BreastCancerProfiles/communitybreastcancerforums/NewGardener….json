After my stage II diagnosis I had tamoxifen and then added monthly Lupron shots to stop my ovarian function.  I had the shots because I wanted to be able to reverse it to try to have kids.  Then the cancer spread, so it seemed an oophorectomy was the better option.  At that point I was 42.  The day surgery was easy and my recovery was only a couple of days.  It's been 4 years - that's 48 fewer visits to the pharmacy & doctor's office for the shots.  For both the Lupron and the oophorectomy I had the usual menopausal symptoms, but they were all manageable.  Well, the hot flashes were pretty miserable, but they've stopped now.  Hope the information helps, good luck with your decision.    ",

I'm now on my third trial. My current trial is for a pi3kca inhibitor with fulvestrant - I qualiified after doing a FoundationOne genomic profile that found I had the mutation. I haven't had any of the three options in the metastatic setting. I had taxol when I was Stage II and hated it. My oncologist had offered Navelbine before I started my clinical trial in 2015. I understand erubilin/Halaven can be tolerable - and I believe the clinic visit is short. I'm chiming in here to mention that Phase 1 trials may be very time consuming. I am not working so I've been able to manage it, but it might be hard if your employer isn't truly accommodating. For the first 8 weeks of my current phase 1 trial I had to go weekly. 3 of those visits were multi-day. 3 of those days involved 8 hours of hourly blood tests. So be sure to ask about time commitment for the oral Taxol trial, which otherwise sounds quite interesting. Good luck with your choice.  ",

So my first impression to your question was - \"No way, stay the course on letrozole until it stops working then move to the next AI.\"  But as I think more, I agree the idea may be interesting...If they can prolong how long letrozole works, then it could better in the long run.  The challenge is they don't seem to have reported any initial results from the SOLE trial - unless I'm not finding them.  I think I would want to see those results.  Another concern I have is the SOLE participants are all early stage.  Maybe they never would have had it spread, so will the results be applicable to people who have mets? So thanks for posting about SOLE.  I'll be watching responses to your inquiry as well.",

Most recently I had a PE at the end of 2017 while waiting to get into a clinical trial - the pain drove me into the ER (shoulder, back, chest). Again I had a thoracentesis - with the new trial drugs again I was lucky it didn't return. So hopefully your new meds will do the trick and address it and they'll be able to remove the catheter.
