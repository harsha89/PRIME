And It continues to worsen for a week after you finish. Nothing helped except SUDOCREM. It really works! I just logged in to put it out here, so everybody can benefit from it. You can get it on amazon: www.amazon.com/Sudocrem-Antise... You will see a BIG difference in no time! Wish you all the best.",

I don't know about sour cream, but plain yogurt does help to cool the burnt skin down and prevent too much peeling. I was covered in yogurt until I got SUDOCREM. And once I got it, my skin went from bordeaux to almost normal skin color in just a few days! This is all thanks to my cousin from Europe. She uses it for her baby's diaper rash! Who could've thought!",
