I have always chosen Emory for major health problems. However, with my diagnosis in August 2018 with stage IIb ER positive, lymph node positive breast cancer things changed. At the age of 35, the first step in my process was fertility preservation and this was handled at Emory(didn't work btw). The weekly appts at midtown or main campus and paying for parking were a bit much for me at the time. This immediately let me know that despite the excellent medical treatment available, my quality of life would diminish based on the sheer amount of stress from downtown traffic and parking alone. My next choice was Piedmont Fayette, which seemed logical as it was closer and no traffic worries. However they sent me to a MO at Georgia Cancer in Fayetteville. I did not like the idea of having a surgeon one office and a MO in another office and appts were being scheduled to far in the future.for my liking. So, I went to CTCA Newnan for a consult. I feel in love with the one stop shopping approach. I have been receiving treatment there since August. My oncologist is great. Every department works together and everyone is very accomadating. I received 4 dose dense biweekly rounds of AC and weekly taxol(recently ended last week due to neuropathy). I would typically receive my schedule via email.and.portal. for my.next.appt.before i completed treatment for the day. Yes, I had some very long days. Labs usually at 8 or.9 followed by provider appts.and ending with chemo in the afternoons. But never once did we have to leave the facility once we arrived as our meals were provided. I was never asked for a copay or deductible as the clinics do not ask anyone for this information. You are allowed to.focus solely on.your treatment. There is a finance department who will.contact you via phone or mail as needed and assistance is available. I am not sure about Medicare. I do know they can't provide food, hotel, or travel discounts if you have Medicare. All your medical information is a available to you through your portal. Labs are typically available 30mins after draw and imaging about 1 hour. This was very important to.me.as I.hate waiting on test.results. of course it's read at your own risk bc your.dr may or may not have reviewed it yet. As I prepare for my left mastectomy at the end of this month, I am very thankful that I.chose CTCA. It was the best choice for me and my family. You have probably made a decision but I wanted you to have some insight to their service . Take Care ",
