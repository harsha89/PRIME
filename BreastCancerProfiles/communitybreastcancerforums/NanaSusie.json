I guess if something doesn't happen soon I will need to look into buying a wig.  I don't think I can keep wearing a ball cap much longer and the family didn't like how scarves or other hats looked on me. On a happier note I have my last rad boost in 10 hours.  Now if I could just get a hair or two .....",

When I went to my chemo class before starting the chemo, the tech suggested starting L-Lysine a week before treatment to prevent the mouth sores.  He said if we still get the mouth sores to up the dose to get rid of them.  I've been taking one 500mg pill everyday since I have problems with sores off and on normally. I haven't seen this suggestion so wonder if any one else has tried it.  I read it is very effective for cold and canker sores.  I had also read it helps to suck on ice chips during the time the T/C is given so I did that too. So far my only SEs has been a mild headache and mild vision problems for a few hours after taking the dexamethasone.  Ok maybe add mild brain fog after going back and correcting the bad grammar and typos here before posting. For those having heartburn it was suggested to take Nexium or Prilosec which is otc now.  I already take a prescription med for acid reflux so didn't need to do this. Had my long hair cut to a pixie last week.  Had always wondered what it would be like to have short hair so now I know.  Sure is easier to take care of but then my hubby said it made me look older :( which was definitely the wrong thing to say.  Not looking forward to the loss and have been procrastinating on ordering some turbans.  They gave me a tie scarf yesterday at the cancer center so at least I will have something but guess I should get my order in today. Will see my oncologist the 26th and ask about getting some anti anxiety med which I sure could have used before my first chemo and after my surgery. Hope everyone is having a good day. Susie",

SEs from the Nuelasta hit me like a truck last night with leg pains but its better this morning. Wishing all a good weekend and those starting chemo on Monday try to not worry too much. Susie",

Friday I will have my second physical therapy session.  My surgeon wanted to stay on top of things and not wait until there was a problem even though I thought I had good range of movement.  He likes to stay ahead of the game which works for me. My physical therapist said they usually see the women later on when its harder to correct.  The surgeon installed my port during my modified radical mastectomy even though I hadn't seen the oncologists yet, but he knew I would need it.  I'm sure glad he got it out of the way. Is anyone else obsessing about breast exams on their other breast?  I find myself checking it all the time and worrying I will find a lump and have to go thru this again.  I've heard some women get the other removed as a precaution but this wasn't discussed with me.  I think I would have had it done and I'm wondering if its still possible and when the best time to do it would be.  I have 3 more chemo sessions to do and then 33 sessions of radiation. Wishing everyone here a good day and lots of hugs. Susie",

Got my assortment of turban, scarf, and hat in the mail today so I did a fashion show for DH.  Definitely not a turban person.  The bucket hat wasn't too bad, at least he didn't laugh.  I guess the scarf looked the best.  I'm estimating I have one more week of hair. Candice, I'm sending you hugs and prayers and hope everyone else is doing ok this week. Susie",
