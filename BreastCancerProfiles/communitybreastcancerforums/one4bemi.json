These last few days have been so emotional.  I, too, cry several times each day.  Just when I think I am accepting the diagnosis and the plan, I fall apart. By the way, there seem to be a few ILC ladies in Texas.  I am in central Texas also.",

I just got the ILC diagnosis last week.  Today I had the MRI and have met with the breast surgeon.  Next week, I am already meeting with the oncologist for a new patient visit. It is so amazing how life can change so quickly.  My mother also passed away from breast cancer and I have always had this fear in my heart and now it is real.  I truly understand your fear, the worry, and the many questions.  I don't have many answers as I am new to this, too.  But I can offer my support through this forum.   It looks like we are beginning this journey at the same time.  I wish you the best in the coming week.  Are you in Texas?",

Scheduled next week to see plastics and I am not even sure I want reconstruction.  Then have to visit radiology oncology this week.  It is not just physically exhausting but emotionally.  Each time I leave one of these visits, I am overwhelmed.  I hope you are making some progress in getting appointments done.  It seems to help to have more informational. I guess the surgery may be the big factor that decides what else has to be done. Thank you for continuing to share. I, too ham having so much trouble telling friends and family.  How do you choose the words.",
