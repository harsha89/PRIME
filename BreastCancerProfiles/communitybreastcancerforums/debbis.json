Question- we're flying out west next month, and will spend a week at high elevations in Montana. Anyone have any advice about wearing/not wearing garments during flight? What about hiking in the mountains? Would like to avoid trouble while there... Thanks! Debbi debbi s Dx 2/17/2011, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIB, 1/7 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
