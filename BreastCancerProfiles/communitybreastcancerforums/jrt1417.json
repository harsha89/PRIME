I just looked back at my notes from my phone conversation with the nurse and she said since I am, that's why they're leaning towards chemo first. I won't make any commitments to that until after I meet with a high risk OB on Monday. I'm doing ok, just anxious to do something. It's making me feel a little claustrophobic knowing that it's in there growing. I'll be 31 weeks on Sunday, it's so nice to communicate with someone facing the same thing at the same time, even though it's under pretty crappy circumstances. I'm here if you need me. Feel free to reach out anytime.",

My first appointment with my cancer team is tomorrow. I have only talked to the nurse that has been assigned to me but she said the doctors had already been communicating with each other and were leaning towards chemo as the first treatment recommendation. Have you received any new information or come up with a plan? How many weeks pregnant are you?",
