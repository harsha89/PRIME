I still have my drains in and hoping to go monday to get them out. I met with the onc and schedule to start chemo august 11th and then he said radiation is preferred since the tumor was 5 cm which i dread more than the chemo. I am nervous about starting chemo. Thanks for the info. i look foward to getting to know everyone. The past two weeks i have been doing alot of searching and reading. jackie",
