I felt the lump in my breast in the shower on January 23rd. I knew intrinsically that it was cancer. I couldn't believe it was happening. I didn't get a mammogram until the 13th of February because I kept waiting for it to go away. See, I am moving to Zurich Switzerland at the end of May to get married and this just wasn't fitting into my plans...When they told me it was cancer, I lost my mind. The hardest thing about this experience has been in the waiting periods. I had to wait another week to get my biopsy so I had a week to mull over what kind, how long, how big, am I going to die? Then waiting for the results and the HER test results. I also had to have a hysterectomy that was planned before I was diagnosed but now I had to have my ovaries taken out because I am estrogen positive which means forced menopause. I had to get into acceptance with some big issues and fast. I had my hysterectomy on the 11th, and yesterday the 20th, I had my sentinel node/nipple flap biopsy. I am scheduled for my mastectomy on the 31st. I am having a single with reconstruction/reduction and hopefully my own nipple. I stay present and everyday I do creative visualization meditations which keep my thoughts on the positive because this is happening whether I am in agreement or not.

I will have to be reevaluated when I get there too. My heart goes out to all of you who are facing chemo. This is such a painful, scary and rough experience to have to have.
