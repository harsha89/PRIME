I am soooo done going to the hospital 2x/day or more if I have doctor's appointments during the day. I have some pretty good fatigue going on as well. I got some numbing cream at my last visit - it only sort of helps; and because of getting the clavicle nodes zapped; I also get the sore throat as well... I am drinking more of the Greek Yogurt protein shakes (my 5 year old wanted to try them the other day - he liked it and is now stealing them any chance he gets..) Thanks for all the support here...it's helped.",

I also start monthly zoladex shots & Tamoxifen treatment during radiation as well.",

My skin is starting to be red and sore, but my RO says it still looks good. I am trying to work 1/2 days during treatment, but its getting harder. I don't know if my fatigue is from current radiation treatment, starting the new meds, dealing with my sick kids (my 5 year old has bronchitis), or what, but I am so tired and unmotivated, all I want to do is crawl back into bed. I guess I am glad to still be here to complain about things....",
