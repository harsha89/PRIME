    "Content": "Jun 26, 2018 09:48PM - edited Jun 26, 2018 09:50PM by JW2 Just wanted to let everyone know, I am also having nausea, dizziness and headaches after radiation. I am half way through 20 courses of Proton Radiation to both breasts, and have mild nausea, sore throat, ear ache, blisters in my mouth, and nasty headaches. I also have loss of appetite and food tastes metallic. The symptoms appear both after treatment (which is usually in the evening), and first thing in the morning, but pass after a bit. My doc says I'm just unusually sensitive, but that symptoms like these are not uncommon for people who have also gone through chemo. I didn't require chemo, but do have fibromyalgia; wonder if symptoms correlate to weakened immune systems? Also, I was told to drink tons of water, because radiation causes dehydration, and a lost of these symptoms could be from that.",
