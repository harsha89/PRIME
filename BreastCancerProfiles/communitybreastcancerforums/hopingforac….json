My mom cried every day after she got her diagnosis and was a nervous wreck.. but she also felt that the anticipation was much worse than the actual treatment. She still cries a lot and has her bad days, especially since she is losing her hair, but after each chemo treatment, it helps knowing there is one less left! Getting reassurance from other women at Look Good, Feel Better helped too. You should look into attending one! My mom does work every day, except for treatment day, and it helps her a lot. Be strong and come here when you need support- you will find lots of it here. And don't be afraid to ask your doctor if he/she can prescribe something for anxiety/depression- it may help you a lot. There is certainly no shame in asking for it. mnikityger- yup, doctor confirmed strep yesterday... she's now on her second round of antibiotics since chemo!  :( Hopeful-1- thanks, I'd love to hear how you're doing as treatment progresses, and appreciate your tip! Pdaw- My mom's scarf from Laurie Erickson came yesterday! I agree- the note was so sweet. I am trying to think about what I can do to thank her and her staff. It is beautiful- the pattern is Te Amo Pink/Lime, for anyone trying to decide what pattern to choose- it is bright, cheerful, and very pretty! Niknak- my mom started out on Xanax but didn't find it too helpful, so now she is on Ativan for anxiety and she says it's helping her a lot. Similar to Carole, it helps her sleep. It might be worth a try for you too? Hope this week is going well for everyone... My mom is finally feeling normal and the strep is getting a little better. Her WBCs are better this week but the RBC's are down.. there's always something!  Her onc just told her he is leaving the practice... what a bummer! He encouraged her to go with him, but the new place is much less convenient for her (currently home is 7 minutes away from the onc) - it would probably take 40 minutes for her to get there, plus it's in the middle of the city with difficult traffic and parking. She is not sure what to do; he is getting a replacement who he says is great, but it would still be kind of stressful to have to switch doctors halfway through treatment. She likes her doctor and he knows her but she's not sure  about the travel, considering how often she has to go to the onc's office. She decided to wait to meet the new doctor and see what she thinks before making any decisions... Have a great day everyone!",

Cutting back on the decadron really helped her a lot; hopefully your doctor will tweak your medications based on how you felt last time, and that should help. Treatment 2 was also nice because my mom knew what to expect this time and was a little more relaxed about everything. PS73, thanks for your response about my mom changing doctors. I completely agree with you. And btw, I love your biography on your member profile. So cute! Joanne, Dianne, Connie, thinking of you all- congrats on the AC milestone! Let us know how it goes! Fingers are crossed for minimal SE's and I'm so proud of how far you've come. Sally, congrats on your wedding anniversary! Hope your side effects aren't too bad when you get to see your family this week! Thinking of everyone this week- those with treatment and those with the week off. Hope the side effects are minimal- as crummy as they are, they are evidence that the chemo is doing its job. My mom has #3 AC tomorrow, which will be nice to get OVER with! Unfortunately she won't let me go with her, so I am a little bummed as I really don't want her to be alone. I got my wisdom teeth out today and the pain meds make me really sleepy and out of it so she prefers that I stay home and heal- ugh, I'd so much rather be with her!! After chemo, she has her genetic counseling appointment and will get tested for BRCA mutations. She's pretty nervous but my dad is going to that appointment with her. Please keep her in your prayers- you beautiful women are all in mine. Lots of hugs!",

She has 3 more taxol left- next one is Wednesday. Overall, the side effects on Taxol have been easier for her than AC, though it has all been emotionally and physically draining for her. We are very much looking forward to that last chemo day- she wants to have her port removed immediately afterwards- and I don't blame her! Then she will have a break followed by 6 weeks of radiation. After chemo, though, we don't think the side effects will be too bad. I'm thinking of you all and cheering you on! Stay strong!",

I am in awe of your strength and positive attitude. You are unbelievable! Keep smiling! Today my mom's counts were much better, so she had treatment #2.... We learned two different pieces of advice today, so I thought I'd share them with you all. The first one seems a little bit obvious but I'd never thought of it before. My mom is on Adriamycin, which has a side effect of mouth sores, so as many of you are, she sucks on ice chips during the 10/15 minutes it is being pushed through her IV line. But since the ice cubes kept melting fast today it was sort of annoying for her, so we decided next time we are bringing popsicles! Will help with the taste in her mouth, hopefully prevent mouth sores, and are just much more fun than ice chips.. She will feel like a kid again! Just thought I'd share... Secondly, nurse practitioner told us about some studies showing that women with good vitamin D levels had a reduced risk of recurrance... so she ordered a vitamin D test on my mom's blood to see what level it is at and will give her super vitamin D supplements if needed. (Since vitamin D is stored in fat, you are good for a while when you have enough, unlike vitamins B and C) Most women only have about 20-30% of what they should have, she said, and if it will reduce my mom's risk of recurrance, I'm all for it. It might be worth asking your onc's about... I know there's a lot to think about and a lot on everyone's plates but I just thought that might help. Good luck to all!",

Hope that helps. Eph, I would trust the advice of your onc and take the steroids just to be sure you don't get sick. In my mom's case, the steroid made her crazy (very restless and jittery, she was unable to sit still or relax or feel comfortable doing anything) so she asked them if she could be taken off it and they said no, they almost garunteed she would get sick without it but reduced her dose. The steriod she is on is Decadron- is that the one your doc prescribed? I would take the minimal dose your doc tells you to take but it is probably a good idea to take it with any other anti-nausea meds you might be on (my mom is on an array of them- Emend, Compazine, Zofran in addition to the Decadron- not sure about everyone else) because I think it's better to be jittery than vomiting. Just my two cents based on my mom's experience... does that help? I'm curious as to how others feel about this..",

My mom had her genetic testing and tomorrow she has an appointment to speak with the counselor- we are not sure if she will get her results then or not, but based on the risk factors she discussed with the genetic counselor, she has a feeling she will be BRCA + which really scares her. She cried A LOT more than usual today and is incredibly anxious to hear the results. We're obviously hoping for a negative result but she is sort of prepared for a positive one.  If she is positive, she will have a propylactic double mastectomy and have her ovaries removed. She asked me to look into reconstruction options and find out as much as I can about the recovery from the surgery/what to expect, etc... I am looking on other threads for this but I was wondering if any of you who may have had a double mastectomy w/ reconstruction would mind sharing what it was like so I can pass the info on to my mom (only if it's not too much trouble, of course-- you can send me a private message!) Loved the picture, Pauldingmom and Sallymae!! Eph- love the laser tattoo removal comment- completely agree ! :)",

She has ILC, 1 cm, stage II, 1/13 positive notes, ER+/HER2-.  I have read each and every one of your posts (it took me a long time- you are a very chatty bunch!) I am inspired by your strength, courage, and your sense of humor. I hope you don't mind if I tag along with you. I feel like I am going through this with my mom. Her biggest struggle right now is the emotional one-  she hasn't gone a day without crying, and my heart hurts for her. I wish she would come to this site or join a support group but she does not want to know any more than she has to because it makes her anxious. She started chemo last Wednesday and I was by her side. It is not a fun journey but I believe it will make our family closer. She is doing A/C for 4 cycles (2 weeks apart) then T for 4 more cycles, also 2 weeks apart. I wanted to introduce myself because I may post again later for some advice on ways I can help her with whatever struggles she may face. So far her SE's haven't been too bad- luckily no nausea but she is very jittery (from the Decadron I think) and restless, and claims to just be feeling \"bla\" and very fatigued. Not looking forward to shaving her head because I think it will hit her hard... Anyway, sorry for blabbing. I wish everyone here the best of luck and the best of health. Stay strong. I'm thinking of you all.",

I am so inspired (and entertained! Pauldingmom- your new rule made me laugh!) by all of you. Pauldingmom- thank you for the suggestions! We actually already went to the Look Good, Feel Better class. It was WONDERFUL. I wish we could do it again- we had a blast. We met some amazing women who gave my mom support and strength the night before her first chemo session; they actually made her not dread it quite so much. I think it's something every woman should do before or during chemo- and enjoy getting pampered! :) I also ordered my mom's free It's a Wrap from franceluxe.com, thanks to your reccomendation on the first post. Laurie is so kind. Elisheva- thanks for the book reccomendation. I will order it (probably for myself though- I ordered my mom the B.O.O.B.S book as well as Just Get Me Through This! A Practical Guide to Breast Cancer, but she did not want them because it was too overwhelming for her.) I didn't read B.O.O.B.S yet, but I did read Just Get Me Through This, and I reccomend it for anyone who is looking for more information. It was written by a breast cancer survivor who gives some great advice. If you're looking for a more \"medical\" book, it's probably not the best one, but I found it very valuable and informative. Just a suggestion for those of you wanting to read! Hopeful-1 and oldstudent, it sounds like you both have teenage (or close to it) children who are not acting quite normal. I also have an 18 year old brother who is going through the same thing- just doesn't know how to act or what to say sometimes, and is very freaked out by everything. I think he was crying when he called me to ask about my mom's 2nd surgery, but he didn't want to be there with us waiting for her. I bet that as time goes on, your kids will start to feel a little more comfortable with everything... I am sure they are just scared, love you very much, and want the best for you. It stinks that life has handed my mom and every one of you ladies this shitty situation, but it's only temporary and will pass... at least that's what I keep telling myself... Thanks again for the responses and for making me feel so welcome. I will keep thinking of you all!",

I am still enjoying reading all your posts, as they give me encouragement and some great advice to pass on to my mom as she goes through this difficult journey... Today was a rather tough day for her, which is why I'm posting. It is day 12 after her first AC treatment, and her hair has begun to fall out... It hit her very hard and she spent a good 10 minutes crying on my shoulder this evening. It hurts to see her so sad, and I try to be as supportive and uplifting as possible while still letting her get out all her emotions. Her hairdresser is coming over tomorrow to buzz it off, so in a way it will be a relief to have it over with even though I know it will be very difficult for her. She has a wig ready, as well as scarves and hats, but I just feel it will be a very traumatic transition for her. She is on AC for 8 weeks followed by Taxol for another week. She was under the impression from her onc. that Taxol was slightly easier for most people (in terms of SE's) than the AC, and it's helped her a lot knowing that after the next 3 treatments, thinks will be looking up. (AC hasn't been easy on her so far).. But today she spoke with a friend who went through BC and chemo 2 years ago, who told her that Taxol was MUCH worse in her experience and went on to terrify my mom... So she was pretty bummed after talking to her, on top of having her hair start to fall out today. Her friend also told her she shouldn't get genetic testing, which she had already decided along with her onc that she would do.... My mom's friend's reasoning: what would you do with that information??? It will just stress you out... I, on the other hand, feel she should get it done because I think it's better to know... any thoughts on this? I know my mom's friend was just calling to be supportive and helpful but she has a VERY different personality from my mom, and sometimes she ends up being more stressful than helpful to her... Sorry, just had to vent for a minute! My last question/concern.... My mom has a pretty bad cold and cough (which I now have too... eek.. trying to keep the germs out of the house!!!!) Her WBC's were very low last week (don't know the numbers as I couldn't make it to the appt, but she said her onc said they were on the \"low side of low\"). The doc seemed to think they would rebound by her next treatment. She did have the Neulasta shot the day after the first chemo... She is scheduled for her second treatment this Wednesday.... does anyone know what the deal is if she still has her cold? Will she be able to get treatment or is the whole schedule pushed back? I'm sure it depends on her WBC count, so my fingers are crossed that it goes up... Have any of you had similar problems? Do you know how low the counts have to be for the doctor to decide not to administer chemo for the day? Obviously every doctor is different but I'm just curious as to what your experiences have been. (I'm also sort of worried that Neulasta isn't working for her..) Sorry to be a downer tonight, ladies. I'm just a little bummed since my mom had a bad day, and I thought some of you might understand... I'm sure things will get better eventually, and I know this is not a fun journey for anyone. My thoughts are with each and every one of you, and I wish you all the best.",

I'm not sure of the grade of her tumor but she had 1/15 positive nodes, ER/PR+ and HER2-. Her treatment plan is also the same as yours- 4 A/C and 4 Taxol. I had never heard about glucosamine but I am going to look into it for the bone pain she may experience during Taxol. I'm glad to hear your SE's are reduced after cutting back on the steriod. Same with my mom, it seemed like most of her SE's the first time around were from the steriod and not the chemo!!! How ironic... Anyway, I am thinking of you and hope that the transition to Taxol goes well for you! Keep us posted!  My mom is working through chemo and I think it's really good for her because it gets her mind off everything. She works from home the day of chemo and even does some of her work emails while actually getting the infusion.. I am so proud of her. So far, the Friday after she has felt too crummy to work but otherwise, she is working full time and her boss has been very good about everything. I'd advise any of you who can and who feel up to it to work when you can so there is still some sense of normalcy in your life! For my mom it is almost therapeutic, and I hope it is the same for some of you. It's sort of relieving to see that my mom isn't the only one who didn't shave her head. I bought her the clippers like she asked me to, but she hasn't had the courage to let me shave it yet. Can't say I blame her- but I am ready just in case she changes her mind. There is hair ALL over our house and she has a few bald spots. It's been a rough couple days for her emotionally. She has strep throat and just can't seem to shake her cold, so she's been staying in the house when not at work. She's very motivated and a definite do-er so I think it's making her crazy to have to stay around the house, watching TV, etc. I think her new appearance and the fact that she isn't doing as much is making her feel like a \"sick person,\" as she says.. I try constantly to cheer her up and to help her out with housework and dinners. I can't wait until she is feeling better because it bums me out so much to see her down. I got an email from Laurie Erickson saying she sent my mom her free \"It's a Wrap\" yesterday- what a wonderful person she is. Her email was so sweet it made me cry. For those of you who haven't gotten your free scarf from France Luxe, I definitely advise you to do so. As always, I'm enjoying keeping up with you beautiful women and am thinking of you all. Wishing you luck and minimal SE's as you are getting these annoying chemo sessions out of the way!",

Is yours a human hair wig or a synthetic? I'm not sure about the answer if it's synthetic but if it's human hair, the lady we spoke with said it is fine to use normal hair products on it- and she advised us to use shampoo/conditioner for color-treated hair because it is a little gentler. But if your wig is synthetic, I think they have special products for those too- I would check wherever you bought your wig. Hope that helps! :)",
