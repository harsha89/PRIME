He said he has only done 4 other breast cancer patients, but has done many for primary peritoneal and appendiceal cancers. I was just evaluated by him and he said he would operate on me if I wanted it done because I am otherwise healthy and have no other sites of metastasis. He does a laproscopic exam before the cytoreductive surgery to see whether it is feasible or not. I have had multiple abdominal surgeries and probably lots of adhesions which may prevent me from having it done, but will probably have him do the laprascope procedure after the first of the year to see whether he thinks it is possible. If you want his contact number I will gladly share it.",
