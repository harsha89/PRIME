So I did mri with contrast in May which stated birads 4, large area of abnormal signal intensity & enhancement involving one 3rd of lateral part of left breast. Extremely dense bilateral breast tissues. Differential diagnoses include inflammation vs lobular carcinoma. Needs us guided biopsy. So I went to do my US guided biopsy the doctor stated that he didn\u2019t see anything and told me to wait 6 months and repeat mri. But I can still feel the lump and hardened lateral side of my breast tissue with tenderness. It has been going on since January. If it was inflammation wouldn\u2019t it go away by now. Do you think I should still wait 6 months to repeat the scan? The nodule that showed in Us & Mri is about 5 to 6 mm. I will be waiting for your reply. Many thanks in advance.",
