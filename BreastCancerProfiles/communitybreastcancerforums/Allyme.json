I have many reasons not to trust doctors, but the stories are way to long to write, especially with the keyboard typing on here. One is when I was in Iraq, dx with a hip sprain. I hurt so badly, but continued with my job for almost 3 months. They only sent me to be tested at Baghdad because they didn't believe me. Turned out I had a femoral neck fracture in my hip. A few more steps and I would have needed a total hip replacement. Instead, I ended up having to have emergency screws put in my hip to hold it together, just so I could make it to Germany. The command actually had the nerve to call, the same one who didn't believe me. The hospital personnel tried to give me the phone and I refused it. He said \" what should I say? \" I said tell him I'm asleep or dead. I never talked to him and he never complained about it. That's one reason I lack trust.

I hope and pray for the best for all of us. We all deserve a cure, to live our beautiful, lovely lives normal and healthy again. Please remember me in your prayers, I will sure do the same for you. I just get so discouraged, and I'm desperate not to leave my family. I don't think my 15 year old daughter could handle this, I know I couldn't. I also don't think my mom could handle this, because she just lost her own mom and dad. I just pray everyday that God will help us all by letting a cure be found. Thanks so very much for your insight and advice. I appreciate you! :) ",

I don't trust the tests in Johnstown, one said I was just constipated and next week the Conemaugh hospital said I have stage 4 bc. Very different dx. UPMC is supposed to have top doctors in PA.

Forgive my ignorance, but what is NED? Also, does stage 4 mean we are on chemo forever, do we ever get to have hair again? I'm not familiar with all this yet, as my onc moved and had to start over with a new one. So far, I've had 8 rounds of radiation and next week will be my 5th chemo of herceptin and Perjeta, along with taxol. I used to have liver pain and vomiting. Now the pain isn't as often and haven't had vomiting in while. Just had a PET that showed no progression, but still have to go over the results with my onc to ask more about the liver. Is it better to just have the tumor removed? Thanks for any info! :)",

It's embarrassing and scary to me. It didn't start until I had started taking Metamucil, as a preventive measure from all the painkillers I'm prescribed. I wasn't having any constipation problems, but was just trying to prevent any. I don't know if this is what caused the new problem or not. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I haven't been on here lately, because I have just been so depressed. :( Thanks for any responses.

I had been eating mostly cream of wheat before all this happened because I was trying to avoid constipation. Then I got the Metamucil too. I was so stupid to mess with something that wasn't broken in the first place. I was having regular bowel movements, I was just scared of constipation. It's not liquid leakage, it's just soft and unformed leakage. I was just so upset, crying, and depressed thinking my life was just over. Thanks for responding and giving other possibilities. I appreciate you all so much. :)",

All he did was say that they're great friends and he's doing the right thing. That's when I realized I wasn't going to get real TX if I stayed where I was at. I asked the specialist to refer me to someone else in upmc, since my onc is not. He was upset about how I would make him look to the onc!! I told him that I can't get TX from someone I can't talk to, or trust that they have my best outcome in mind.
