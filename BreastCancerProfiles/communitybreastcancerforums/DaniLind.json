Doc says it need to be desensitized. I have numbness by the scar & strange pin & needles sensations in my scar areas. Also my underarm feels swollen & heavy but it's not visiblely swollen. It's also very sore & I have tingling down to my fingertips. Has anyone experienced this? Will it settle & go back to normal? I'm freaking out. Anyone else suffer like this after this surgery? Is it just too early afterwards to expect the pain to be gone? Dx 2/2019, ILC, Left, 1cm, Stage IA, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Guess it\u2019s goid I\u2019m on it. Although I\u2019m trying hard to get off of it. Gained 30 lbs from it. Obviously it\u2019s not important compared to this, but it does make me feel uncomfortable. I have arthritis issues so the extra weight is not helpful. The more I write the more of a hot mess I feel. I\u2019m getting so used to living with this pain & that pain. Tired of having such a compromised existence. I know there is always worse. I feel guilty feeling bad about how I feel. But why can\u2019t all of us just be healthy & not have any of this!",
