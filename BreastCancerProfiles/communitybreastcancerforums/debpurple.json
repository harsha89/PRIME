I breast feed both of my children and understand your concern. I used to get lumps because of my milk ducts got block or something. I never thought about breast cancer. So I never really gave it much thought. Have you talk to your Dr? I hope it's only milk duct problems. I am now 37 with breast cancer and my children are ages 10 & 11. So it's been awhile since I breastfeed. I do remember my breast getting very sore and having lumps at times. They got so large I couldn't touch my fingertips a few times. Sorry I couldn't be more help.",

I am HER2/neu positive, tumor size .7 cm So for now am at Stage 1. They will check nodes on the 12th. i am still worried about it but I am hopeful it will be ok. My sister wasn't so lucky. She is stage 3. I am praying for all of you that have to go through this. I wish we didn't have too. But I am glad to have this place to talk about everything. Thanks!",

      "Content": "Jul 15, 2010 09:05AM - edited Jul 15, 2010 09:07AM by debpurple Well I am home after surgery on left breast. I had it done 12th. I am feeling ok but I keep getting this burning pain where the tube for the drain is. It kinda of hurts. If I move a certain way it hurts. I use pillows to prop my arm up which seems to help. Anyone else have this kinda of pain? My husband can't look at the incision or at the drain. So I have to get my 11 yr old daughter to help dress my cut and the drain tube. I have been milking the tube myself. It's not too bad. My husband feels like he has let me down. I don't want him to feel bad because he can't help with the drain tube or bathtime. I am very independent any ways. So I like doing things on my own any ways.Â  I thought I would pass out or die when I saw my breast gone. I did want too but my daughter was there with me. I couldn't let her know how I felt. She had a scared look on her face. I told her it was ok and try to just keep on getting ready to take first shower. I do have expander in with a little fluid. It still looks flat and feels numb. My arm has some numb feeling up to my elbow. I know it will take time and it will get better. I am waiting on path report about lym. nodes. Best wishes to all of you who are on the journey too. God bless all of you. Take care!!",

I laid on my right side opposite of mastectomy and on my bellow alittle. I used a pillow to prop up my left arm to take pressure off of it. Leaning over to pick up something hurts. The pressure is bearable but uncomfortable. I haven't had to take anything for pain in two days. So it does get better. The fluid in my drain in getting less. I hope I can get it out Monday. I am sleeping better and taking a shower is getting a little easier. If you have a drain tube ask the hospital nurse if she can give you your IV tube to use to hold your drain bag while taking a shower. My nurse told me that what the used for patience. You loop it in the hoop on the drain bag then tie it around your neck. It better than a shoe string.",

I was wondering is there some questions I need to ask him so I know everything I should know. I am very nervous and scared. I am glad I found this form and I want to thank everyone for posting questions and answers. It has been very helpful to me so far. I was just Dx.last wk. I need to get copies of what the test said. I have small breast and just cutting it out wouldn't work. Do I have to have it taking out? Why can I just do Chemo? Where do I look for answers? Thanks!! Debra",
