Just got my Dx on last Friday and went in for my lumpectomy and SNL yesterday. So glad I only had to wait 4 days. I was in by 8:30 and surgery was at 10:30 and home by 3. Feeling pretty good and my 2 yo DD loves my blue pee. The doctor thinks he got it all and the nodes were negative so far but waiting on full pathology report. Very glad I found this site. Looking forward to getting to know all of you!",

I had already decided on Chemo, and just had my 2nd one yesterday,  but this just kind of confirmed my decision. When I was waiting for the results I was secretly  hoping for a really high score so I would not be in the grey area.",
