Diagnosed Stage IV in 2011 with tumor on L 4 tsp caused spine fracture. Underwent minimally invasive surgery where they removed fractured bone and inserted cage to support spine and radiation. Took Femara for 6 months when it failed. Mets to spine (2 different places), skull, left femur and pelvis. Currently taking Afinitor/Aromasin since November 2011 mets are stable. I am currently unemployed and looking for a job. Lost my job as a Customer Service Manager in august. I don't post often but find great comfort and knowledge from reading all of your posts knowing that everyone understands what we are all living with.",
