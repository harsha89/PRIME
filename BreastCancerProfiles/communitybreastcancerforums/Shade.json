I don't live in Denver so I haven't heard of it but I notice that they are sponsoring and promoting the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer - Rocky Mountain Walk on June 28-29, 2008. Seeing as the event is coming up soon, perhaps they would be willing to talk about Angela's story on air and see if anyone comes forward to help with treatment or perhaps getting an airline, Disneyland and a hotel to donate? Perhaps we could also contact the PR company that is raising awareness of the Avon walk to see if Avon might be able to help with making Angela's trip to Disneyland possible? The PR company might also be able to do some pro-bono (ie free) PR work to help us make Disneyland and the airlines aware of what we are trying to do. The contact details for the PR company for the Avon breast cancer walk is: Randi Friedman BNC 212.253.4650 RFriedman@bncpr.com Shade",

      "Content": "Jun 9, 2008 05:09PM - edited Jun 9, 2008 05:16PM by Shade In line with what LUVmy2girlZ suggested, perhaps it might also be worth calling the public relations department at Disneyland directly, telling them the plan and see if they can help? I googled and found the following contact information for the Disneyland Resort Newsroom: Contact Information Disneyland Resort Public Relations P.O. Box 3232 1313 Harbor Blvd. Anaheim, CA 92803-3232 714/781-4500 (tel.) 714/781-4440 (fax) I also found the following contacts who might be able to help if no one is being helpful on the number above (again listed on the newsroom page): Mike Hyland Director, Public Relations Disneyland Resort 714/781-4409 mike.j.hyland@disney.com Hope it helps.",
