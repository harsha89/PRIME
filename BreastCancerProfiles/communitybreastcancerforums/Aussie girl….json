Also I don't know how true this is but I was talking to a acquaintance who is a body builder and she told me she put herself on tamoxifen for 2 years (no judgement from me on whether is is healthy or not) because it's a estrogen blocker and it helped her to lose weight, she didn't have any complaints about hair thinning. I've been on it for about 6 weeks now my shedding although hasn't stopped it hasn't gotten any worse either if anything it's slowing down. The only side effects I'm finding is hot flushes and joint pain both of which I had before starting it.",
