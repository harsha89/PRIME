However,  I had to have surgery to have a urethral caruncle removed 4 months ago because the treatment would have been a few weeks on Vagifem and he would NOT allow it...pretty extreme I think.  I believe that  having major surgery was more of a hit to my body than a few weeks of Vagifem!  Anyway,  there's no talking to him.  I may have to go out of network to get any other opinions.  He will give me the Vagifem if I get on Tamoxifen.  I guess he feels it will be blocked. I tried the AIs and the side effects were intolerable, but my Onc is just so adament that I be taking a drug for 5 years.  I really don't feel that's the way to go anymore...at least for me.  I have a 76% chance of no relapse without the drugs (according to the Oncotype Dx)  and I think all the lifestyle changes I've made will increase that. When it comes right down to it, I think the treatment we choose should be OUR decision.  I'm just not willing to give up all QOL to be so miserable on those meds for 5 years!  Unfortunately, my family and some friends don't agree with my decision.  I wish this was easier...",

      "Content": "pixelpup wrote: Hi Everyone, And what about sex after BC?  Any ideas for the atrophic vaginitis that occurs with no estrogen?  My urethral lining also became so thin that 8 weeks ago I needed surgery to remove an urethral carunkle (seriously!  I had never heard of this before and it was SO painful!)  My male GYN said \"You've been dealt the worst hand possible\" (basically meaning that sex was either going to be very painful or a thing of the past... I mean how much good can Astroglide do in our situation?)  However, I went to a female GYN and she was much more understanding.  She prescribed Vagifem ( the lower 10 mg dosage) and said it delivers only a small dose locally to the vaginal area.  She is the first one to address this quality of life issue with me. Any other ideas for the absolute misery down there?  Alison Dx 4/2010, ILC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I just got my saliva test results this morning and my estrogen level is only  0.5 (range is 0.5-1.7 for postmenopausal women.)  It seems to me that the side effects would outweigh the benefits of taking Tomax when my estrogen level is already so low.  Does that make sense?  Of course, he is adament about me taking it. He just doesn't get the concept of QOL!",
