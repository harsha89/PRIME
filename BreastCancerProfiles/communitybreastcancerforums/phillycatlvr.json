The next day my doctor called and said there is a nodule in my left breast and I needed to get more films and an ultrasound. I wasn't too worried then. Tonight the mammogram report was posted on my patient portal. I made the mistake of googling the medical terms and now I can't sleep. My appointment isn't until next Monday. Log in to post a reply",

I saw my doctor a couple weeks later and she said it was nothing to worry about...just normal breast tissue. At the end of February I had to move suddenly which meant (among other things) that my insurance changed and I needed a new doctor. This took several months. I finally saw her at the end of June. I told her about the lump and she referred me for a combined screening/diagnostic mammogram which I had this afternoon. After I had the mammogram I waited a little while and then was told I needed an ultrasound. After the ultrasound I was told that the lump is probably not normal breast tissue and needs to be biopsied. I have been scheduled for a biopsy next Wednesday. I'm trying not to freak out.
