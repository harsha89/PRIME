IMHO, there's much more to this affair story that we don't yet know and maybe never will, but I'm not buying that he told his wife  in 2006 about his affair. If that were true, why on earth would he be going into a very public hotel in LA to  seethe other woman and her baby her in 2008?  Then there's the possible paternity test.  I would also love to know who told the National Enquirer that John Edwards would be at the hotel that night and that two rooms were reserved in someone else's name.  Somebody got paid big bucks for that tip. The National Enquirer will not let up and again I feel sorry for Mrs. Edwards.  If she wants to get away from this story if won't be possible, not for a long time.  Diane, you are correct - there are no winners here.  Very sad.",

I'm linking to Dr Susan Love's site on her take on CA 27-29.  She explains it much better than I. http://www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/content.asp?L2=4&L3=7&SID=132&CID=591&PID=0 As you can see, we don't yet have one tool, one scan or one blood test that is relevant for everyone.  Some things work for some people and some oncs don't use any of it until a problem arises.  This can be a little disconcerting at times but try not to let it get to you.  As time passes, better \"things\" will come along for detection.  Hugs, Jelly",

The suggestion about the Zofran is a good one, though not everyone feels nauseous after surgery (thankfully!).  I've only had it happen once and no one knows why.",

As far as waking you up, my guess would be aboslutely not -- the PS will use the size s/he deems right. Talk to your PS before the surgery and discuss the possibility of sizes and what your preference is. Mine are smaller than I'd like (350) but I'm not about to endure another surgery to have them replaced.  Plus, the PS said my anatomy is small and a larger implant would cause pain.  Maybe, just maybe,  he's right...

Unfortunately these days we don't get to talk with the anethesiologist (sp?) until a few minutes before surgery, when in reality that doctor is equal to the surgeon in importance.

This entire cancer experience sucks big time.  I used to be crazed over every little thing, but I believe the estrogen helps me cope better than I did without it.  The SSRI's did not work for me and only made me more jittery, and xanax is real good but I was afraid of becoming hooked, though I did take it for about a year -- so estrogen is my saving grace. ETA:  I'm with you doc on this one!!!  Nothing to lose and the propensity for gain, I hope in a big way. Regarding a heart attack, I was not on estrogen when I had my heart attack in early 2006, and had been off of it for four years at that time. I'm excited for you!! Jelly",

As you can see, I'm still here three years later and have not had any side effects at all.  In my 20's I had a hysterectomy -- so those \"parts\" were not a worry on estrogen.  My oncologist is stumped as to why it hasn't killed me yet.  I had a total of four tumors and all were 95% ER+.

He asked if I was taking it for \"libido\" and I laughed.  No husband, no boyfriend -- what libido? LOL In '07 a scan showed a small \"growth\" on my lung and several \"spots\" on my bones.  Of course it stressed me out but since I cannot and will not ever have chemo, I decided on no further testing and no further scans until I'm in pain.  So far, so good.  I'm still walking and breathing.  On my last Onc visit, he said I can see him once a year instead of twice since I'm doing well. I do know this disease will kill me (I do have a heart condition too, so it's possible that can get me first) and it's just a matter of time. Really, really hoping and praying that estrogen is a miracle drug for you! Jelly",

I've encountered a few doctors of his ilk early in my diagnosis and remember feeling worse when I left their office, due to their behavior and not the cancer.  This is your life and you deserve to be treated by a doctor who understands you're a human being  and will treat the whole person along with the cancer. You came to a good place with your questions and fears.  The women here are kind, knowledable and helpful.

Regarding the hot flashes, you are not weird.  It may be unusual, but it does happen.  When I had my bi-lat mast., I had horrid hot flashes in the hospital which continued when I came home.  My surgeon never heard of it either (do surgeons talk to each other?) Two weeks after the surgery I was at dinner with friends and had a \"soaking\" episode at the restaurant and went outside to get some air and cool off.  A month later I asked the GYN and he never heard of it either.  Perhaps surgeons should read these boards to become cognizant of what women endure. How are you feeling otherwise?  I elected not to have reconstruction so I can't speak to DIEP.  Hope it went well and you're feeling better each day.",

You also may want to ask what grade the cancer is (which IMO is more important than the size of the tumor.) \"Getting it all\" is an expression that is not used any longer.  There may be cells floating around that cannot be detected, but please don't focus on that aspect, just focus on your chemo and doing all you can to combat the cancer. I also had three positive nodes (along with a tumor and a nodule) six years ago and I'm fine today. The very best to you and come back here as often as you see fit.  We have a great and very supportive group of women here who will help you through. Jelly",

Then after 4 years or so came the bilateral mastectomy and once again was freightened out of my mind to look at my chest.  Not sure how long it took this time but eventually I found the courage to see what I looked like without breasts, and although not liking it at all, I did come to terms with the new look.  I will be having reconstruction soon (after 2.5 years of being without breasts) and I'm happy about my decision. There is not a set time limit of what is best for you.  When you're ready to look you'll know it -- just know that you're not alone with this issue. Wishing you the best, Jelly",

What I had not mentioned in those thread was that I took eight weeks off from work to recover.  Eight total weeks of rest, no stress, sleeping when I felt tired, leisurely going through the day, reading, relaxing and eating protein/vegetables.  When I finally did go back to work (full time) the first few weeks were hard on my body and I felt like a truck ran over me. I would come home and get in bed for the night - at 5:00 PM!! I've had many, many surgeries in life starting at age 19 (most not cancer related) and to be honest, I'm glad back then that I was totally unaware of how \"easy\" someone else's recuperation may have been because I might have wanted to punch them in the eye .   In all but one of the surgeries, I took my time and took it easy until my body was ready to \"go.\"   With the first lumpectomy/SNB/AND my life was not going well and I had no choice but to get back to work ASAP.  It was a nightmare; pain, fatigue, feeling sore and miserable, plus the emotional turmoil of knowing I had cancer. A few times I left work early just due to extreme fatigue and crying jags.  That recovery took a long time, much longer than it would have if I had had the rest and relaxation required after a surgery. You will feel better in time - however long your body needs to recuperate.  Don't try to rush it!!  I did not have physical therapy but I understand that it is very helpful for mastectomy patients.  If it is something feasible for you to do then by all means, do it.

There was a time in my life that I managed academic grants (non-medical) and the largest cost by far is salaries/benefits, followed by materials/supplies (desks, computes, materials, etc.)  We, at the time, held a very tight string on spending and adherence to the specifics of the grant - meaing - no big holiday bash paid by grants funds, etc. I was both elated and forlorn with the movie \"Living Proof.\"  Elated, of course because the drug is successful for millions of women.  Forlorn and even angry of the hospital/drug company politics that got in the way and delayed what has become a miracle drug for many.  Even worse, was when Mrs. Tartikoff took it upon herself to plead to Revlon for the big initial funding.  WTF (excuse me!!!!)  It's wonderful that Mr. Ron Perlman and his Revlon Board agreed to fork over 2.4 million, but what if they did not?  Why didn't Dr. Slamon (sp?) get a grant or many grants??

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death among women, according to the National Cancer Institute. This year, an estimated 207,090 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, while 39,840 women will die from the disease. Halaven is a synthetic form of a chemotherapeutically active compound derived from the sea sponge Halichondria okadai. This injectable therapy is a microtubule inhibitor, believed to work by inhibiting cancer cell growth. Before receiving Halaven, patients should have received prior anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy for early or late-stage breast cancer. Halaven's safety and effectiveness were established in a single study in 762 women with metastatic breast cancer who had received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens for late-stage disease. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either Halaven or a different single agent therapy chosen by their oncologist. The study was designed to measure the length of time from when this treatment started until a patient's death (overall survival). The median overall survival for patients receiving Halaven was 13.1 months compared with 10.6 months for those who received a single agent therapy. \"There are limited treatment options for women with aggressive forms of late-stage breast cancer who have already received other therapies,\" said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the Office of Oncology Drug Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"Halaven shows a clear survival benefit and is an important new option for women.\" The most common side effects reported by women treated with Halaven include a decrease in infection-fighting white blood cells (neutropenia), anemia, a decrease in the number of white blood cells (leukopenia), hair loss (alopecia), fatigue, nausea, weakness (asthenia), nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy), and constipation. Other FDA-approved therapies used to treat late-stage, refractory breast cancer include Xeloda (capecitabine) for patients with breast cancer resistant to paclitaxel and anthracycline-containing chemotherapy; Ixempra (ixabepilone) for patients with late-stage disease after failure of an anthracycline, taxane and Xeloda; and Ixempra plus Xeloda for patients with late-stage disease after failure of anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy. Halaven is marketed by Woodcliff Lakes, N.J. -based Eisai Inc.

Honestly, it isn't about what we think - it's your body and your decision, and it's best to go with your feelings.

Sending prayers, good wishes and healing energy your way. Hugs, Jelly",

You may want to buy yourself some button down shirts for when you get home, and also button down pajamas.  They're much easier to manuever than trying to put anything over your head.  There are some very good threads here at BCO that you may want to search/read for other suggestions. I had the bilateral without reconstruction and I fared quite well living alone, and without any help. Try to eat well up until the surgery to build up your body, and again after you get home.  The very best to you, and please, keep us informed on your progress. Jelly",

In the US, this medical mess we're in is a behemoth and complicated problem and it would shock me if there is a viable solution anytime soon.  If universal healthcare took effect tomorrow, some or most of the (almost) 50 million uninsured may decide to see a doctor within a month or two and there are not nearly enough doctors to fill this need.  It would create total chaos and impact each and every one of us.  I've been uninsured and it's no picnic, but a system like Canada's does not seem like the panacea.  Certainly, I hope some team of brilliant people (like Mensa members, doctors, financial gurus, insurance people, etc.) can initiate something that is fair and just, and will solve this awful problem.",

She may need Diflucan, and probably more than one dose, but only if she does not have liver mets as that drug can be hard on the liver. Probiotics (bought at a health food store) along with cranberry vitamins (as opposed to the juice which has tons of sugar in it) and a good strong cream for the vaginal area are all benefical (but of course check with her doctor first).  The cream I have is: Nystatin and Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream USP (by prescription) -- it's the Big Daddy of creams and is very effective, and works quickly to relieve the burning and itching.  Some type of estrogen (in cream or gel form) for a short amount of time may greatly benefit her too. It's best for her to refrain from eating anything with sugar until this bugger clears up. I'm not a doctor, but am just relaying what's worked for me in the past when I suffered with many of those infections, including one time when I went to the ER twice in the same day.  It's one of the reasons I went back on estrogen and I've been okay ever since. I hope she encounters a doctor that knows how to treat this type of infection -- and quick! Wishing her the best and fast relief.",

It's all too easy to get upset when one has been diagnosed with breast cancer, then hears of another nodule/tumor elsewhere in the body.  I've had myself dead and buried numerous times in eight years, lol.

I'm a big proponent of everything disposable for a hospital stay due to germs.  I did pack a robe and used it, but stayed in the hospital gown; used their slipper socks and the other disposable items provided by the hospital, then threw them in the trash when leaving. When I came home the robe and the clothes I wore home went right into the laundry. Although it may sound ridiculous, when you get home wipe your cell phone, handbag, suitcase, etc. with alcohol or antibacterial wipes.  You want to do everything in your power to prevent a staph or even worse, MRSA infection.  In addition, you may want to pack your own hand sanitizer for yourself, guests', doctors & nurses to use.  In some hospitals these dispensers are in every room, but I'm not sure how often the personnel partake. Best of luck on your surgery and recovery.",

I'm so terribly sorry that you find yourself here and having to ask these question at such a young age. We're all here for you. (((Hugs))) Jelly",

If it were me, I'd go for the mastectomy to lessen any cancer cells that could be hanging around your breast area.  But, of course, it's your decision to make after gathering facts and doing what you feel is right for you. Happiness can come in different forms and hearing \"not metabolic active\" is a form of happiness.  Great to hear Herceptin is working!  YEAH! Jelly",

      "Content": "Jul 31, 2009 06:20PM - edited Aug 4, 2009 04:25PM by Jellydonut Hi Christina, Right now what you know for certain is that you have a lump in your breast that needs a biopsy.  It isn't cancer unless the pathology report states it's cancer -- and surely there is a chance that it is not.  We all hope the latter for you. It depends on the surgeon as to the type of biopsy you will have.  Mine was a fine needle aspiration (FNA)  done in the dr's office, and it was virtually painless and over quickly.  I don't subscribe to the theory of a biopsy spreading the cancer and I believe it to be an old wives' tale.  It is not better to leave it alone!  You do need to know for certain one way or the other. Some of our wonderful women on this site will come by with their stories and encouragement. It's so awful that you're now dealing with this issue on top of everything else.  It just doesn't seem fair. We're here for you.  Please let us know how you are and how your appointment goes on Thursday.  All good wishes are with you. Hugs (((()))) Jelly",

For ER+, it's my understanding, that estrogen can \"hide\" in fat cells, hence, it makes sense to keep weight in the correct BMI for your body.  But, a normal BMI is also better for overall health for the entire population!!!  It doesn't sound to me like it was a smart thing for a doctor to say on Oprah.  Someday, I wish a doctor would be honest and just tell it like it is...we don't know what causes BC; we don't have early detection and we don't yet have a cure. BTW, I'm highly ER+ and I've been back on estrogen since 2006 (against dr's advice).  It makes me wonder about the entire estrogen thing.  I'm still doing well and no doctor knows why????? ",
