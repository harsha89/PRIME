That's not good enough for me. We have Lynch Syndrome in our family, my father passed from pancreatic cancer at age 49, 17 weeks after diagnosis, I take reports seriously. Anyways, rewind a week, I find a \u201clump\" in the shower at the 5 o'clock region of my right breast. Report says \u201cpossible haematoma and fat necrosis. Hyperechogenicity and solid and cystic lesion\" in point of interest. Not expected but found was a fibroadenoma at 2 o\"clock and an area or irregular hypoechogenicity with shadow with little vascularity, query scarring, PASH or peak of normal breast tissue at the 12 o\u2019clock are both of these I am led to believe by Dr Google are ok What a mixed bag report. Can anyone shed some light please? Log in to post a reply",
