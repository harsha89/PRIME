No stroke....not so great news....biopsy shows DCIS....Great news stage 0.   After our initial meeting with BS she ordered an MRI of both breasts.   MRI on Jan 5 shows same findings as biopsy, with no involvement of left breast but remarks were 2 non specific lymph nodes in right axilla.  After talking out options we have decided on lumpectomy with balloon brachytherapy IF my margins and sentinel node mapping come out clear.  I feel so fortunate with this initial diagnosis....but at the same time I am scared to death.  I am going to be going for a needle placement on Jan 24th the evening before my scheduled surgery on the morning of the 25th.  Is this any way as painful as the core biopsy? ",
