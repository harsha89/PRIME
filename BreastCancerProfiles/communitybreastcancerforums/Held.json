My mast was 10/07, 4 weeks later I was in the hospital having surgery to clean out the infected side.  4 weeks after that the doc had to take out the expander because the infection would not clear.  I waited 3 1/2 months to heal (it was my choice to wait this long) before letting him try another expander.  I think my doc wwould have done the lat flap if I had wanted to speed up the process, but I really didn't want the lat flap. I can also remember feeling like a freak with one side standing at attention and the other all wrinkled up.  I wore my boob-in-a-box for special occasions, but most of the time I didn't wear anything, because no one noticed (I wear scrubs to work, and baggy shirt most of the time).  When all this started (my mammo was 1 year ago today), I could not imagine having to wait a whole year to get put back together, I didn't think I would survive that long, and the doc was going to try to do it in 6-9. But after all the crap with the infection, I just wanted to make sure I was strong and healthy before we tried to move forward.  My exchange was 7/25, and my doc would be doing my nips any day now, but again I chose to make sure I was recovered enough to tolerate another 1-2 hour surgery (my exchange last about 2 1/2), so I am putting it off a month.  I can't wait to get all this done and over with.  I was really, reallly, really, really was hoping to be done by the anniversary of my mast., but I will be close. I will just have my tats left. I am sure you are disappointed that your reconstuction is being delayed.  It really sucks, but it sounds like your doc has your best interest at heart by wanting you to heal complely before he tries again. I have to be honest, I am personally concerned that you are still running a fever.  Does your doc know?  How many different antibiotic have you been on?",
