It really fills me with strength and my pain is released a little bit when I read all your replies. My appointment with the doctor get ahead of schedule. I just talked to my doctor. She advised me to keep using Femara and zometa monthly. There will be no chemo and rads within a short period. At least the treatment will be a little eaiser. 4everhopeful, it is so encrouging to know that you are doing well for more than 5 years. And I wish everyone here will be doing all fine. Just a question, if you feel comfortable to share the answer, what medchine do you take during the 5 years?Â ",

      "Content": "luphy2006 wrote: It is too late to think about whether it is unfair or not. But when it happens, all I can do is to take it and fight. When I was diagnosed of breast cancer of stage IV in February last year, the tumor was already 5cm x 7 cm in size, bones metastasis. Then I took chemotherapy and Radiation therapy. Those were the most dark and desperate days. I was weak, suffering and even thought of giving up sometimes. Thanks to the support of my family, I felt that I could not so easily give up not only for me but also for them. The good news was that after 9 months therapy, the size of the tumor had decreased to 2 cm x 2cm in size and the signs of spreading to bones disappeared. So I wanted to do a surgery to remove the tumor. The doctor also agreed with my opinion. After the surgery, for the first time, I became a little relaxed. I took another short chemotherapy after I recover from the surgery. You never know when death knocks the door. At the beginning of this month, I was diagnosed that the cancer had spread to two of my ribs. Meantime, I heard of that a friend of mine who was also diagnosed of stage IV breast cancer with bones metastasis at the same time with me has passed away. I also heard of that in some cases, people may live for years after breast cancer spread to bones. One problem for me is that I can hardly bare chemotherapy within this year because the leukocyte level in my spine is too low after turns of chemotherapy. For me, this is a fight, both a mental fight and a physical fight. Even if I just have another year to live, I will try to make it longer. I am really in need of the suggestions for the future treatment. It will be so helpful if anyone can give me some treatment suggestions. Or, can anyone who is also diagnosed of bone metastasis share their treatment experience please? Dx 3/2/2010, IDC, 5cm, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
