I'm back at home, thank GOD for my mom, she has been a tremendous help during this entire time. She is a breast cancer survivor, and she give me the encouragement I need along with helping me thru this process and along this journey. I is normal to feel off balance? I see my surgeron next Tuesday for the after surgery pathology and then on to the Oncologist. I am super happy I found this site to get information and share. Sometimes you just need to see it written to diminish the tears.",
