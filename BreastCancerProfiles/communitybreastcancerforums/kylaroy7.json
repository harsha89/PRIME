Last year I had a 2 normal mammograms with only the findings of a few simple cysts in my left breast (had 2 mammos because of palpable lumps).  Fast forward to about July of this year and I began to be able to \"feel\" my left breast.  Like, just that it was there.  Does that make sense?  I began getting \"electrical zaps\" and the feeling of \"let down\" (haven't breast fed in 7 years) with increasing frequency - 5-7 times a day.  All of this only in my left breast.  To confuse matters worse, randomly on the Sunday before my mammo, I woke up to find that around the nipple of my RIGHT breast was completely soaked through my shirt.  Got a mammo and sono done last week and they saw many \"clusters\" of cysts on the mammo.  On the sono they could see the cysts as well as one which was \"gray\" not black.  Might be a \"complex cyst\" or \"dialated duct\".  They scheduled a core biopsy for Monday.  Can you tell me anything based on my symptoms? I really would like a \"statistical\" number too of what percentage of complex cysts are benign.  They also did a full hormone blood panel and everything was normal.  I began menstruation at age 9.  Thanks in advance.
