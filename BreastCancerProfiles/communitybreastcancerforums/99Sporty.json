I did well on that round also but this time, I've felt 'almost normal' all but the evening of infusion day so far.   Now I need to get to bed because I am going to try to get up early and hit the gym!  I haven't done that in forever. I hope all the new starters fare well and those that are already knee deep with me, keep the faith and try to stay strong and positive.  If you are suffering, talk to your docs..  I was having some heartburn/reflux and was going to let it go - but talked to the doc, they put me on something- cleared it right up and said it could cause more problems down the road if not treated.   Tell them if you're suffering / struggling!  Big Hugs to all of you.",

I'm going with neoadjunct due to the size and because I'm triple negative.  Hoping and praying this thing shrivels up to nothing prior to surgery. So far the only non-medical tips I have for fighting side effects are to chew ice chips(or maybe italian ice during infusions to prevent mouth sores and also mints to fight the metal taste.  Any other tricks of the trade you've heard of yet?  I picked up my meds and biotene today..  getting my port in on Wednesday and first infusion Thursday. ",

I've had 2 infusions now.  Started 12/30/10 via port. I'm getting A/C every 2 weeks for 4 cycles then T for 4 more, every 2 weeks.  My SEs have not been bad at all.  The day of the infusion I get hit hard a few hours later with just a total wipe out and need a nap.  Other than that some occasional lack of appetite but not too bad.  My first cycle I got Emend in the IV and then 2 days of pills- this time they switched to a 3 day dose in the IV and I think that really made a difference, I have felt well from the time I wake up each day since the 2nd infusion which was Thursday 1/13.  Stuff I'm doing for SE's - gargling with baking soda for the mouth sores - been kind of on the verge of getting them but no actual sores yet.  Also using the L-Glutamine powder.  My drug store has it, they have a GNC section.. available on line and at GNC or probably most other health food stores.  Helps with sores, nausea and neuropothy..  Taking stool softeners and fiber tabs - no prob with constipation which is a big fear since I have a history of internal hemmorriods.. Day 1 of my first round I got a bit of constipation but drinking tons of water (I don't mind water, some peeps need to do different fluids) and the softeners helped and no prob since.  My hair is now getting on my nerves.  I had hair down to my butt, got a very cute short cut last weekend which I love and donated to Locks of Love..  now my hair is coming out- just strands,no big chunks..my scalp is sore and tingling on and off.  I had planned to shave it as soon as it started coming out but it doesn't look bad yet..but its bugging me!  No wig plans, got a Gaila Fund wrap and some other wraps and scarves and lots of hats..  my Hubby doesn't think I should rush into shaving it while its still looking okay but I hate it falling out.  Anyway - I am finding the chemo to be manageable and I'm working thru it other than the day of infusion and allowing for short days as  needed otherwise.  My  job is very fine with whatever I need to do..  so that's a load off for me.  I planned to be off Friday but worked most of the day without problem.  Felt well yesterday too..  so for those of you getting started, as was said before - the anticipation may be worse than the reality.  It is different for everyone so some will have more issues but for me so far,not so bad.",

I've got a head wrap on today, a litle too warm in the office.. once the stubble is gone I'll probably go for some lighter weight scarves at work.  I'm not into the wig thing. I have no idea what determines who does and does not get neulasta.  I suspect the insurance co is part of it.. I'm thinking if they cover it, the onc gives it..  if they make you 'need' it first, then maybe not.  But I don't know that for sure.  I'm getting 4xAC and then 4xT at 2 week intervals.  not sure if the neulasta is a given after the T too or not but I\"m scheduled for the shot the day after each of the first 4 rounds. (next 4 not scheduled yet) I'm still feeling really well, on day 4 after cycle 2.  I did get to the gym this morning  - YAY!  hoping to keep that up.  I have not had any surgery yet and my lump has substantially shrunk in 2 treatments - like from a golf ball to kinda hard to find!  I'm really glad we did the neoadjuvant in my case - great to see this thing melt away! ",

I'm surprised some of you that are having a lot of rounds were not recommended for the port immediately.  It was pretty much automatic with my docs and I'm glad cuz I'm a tough stick. I bought some hats this week, need to get some scarves too.  I have lots of doo-rags cuz I'm a biker ( or at least I was before kids!) but I want to have some nicer scarves at least for work.  I'm getting my hair chopped short next week and donating it.  I have waist length hair..  I'm kind of excited about finally getting it cut short.  Also curious to see how it comes back.  Thanks for the link Julie - I'm going to go check out those chemo tips.  I'll check in tomorrow after my first round - hopefully to tell you it was NO SWEAT!",
