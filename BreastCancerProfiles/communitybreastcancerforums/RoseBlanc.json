I have recovered beautifully but cannot cope with the \u2018sanded\u2019 sunburn feeling - both breasts. It eats away on my nerves - the constant irritation and pain. No painkillers numbs it- is that possible! When reading this blog about women struggling with it for months i know I am not brave enough to live with it for months. Any good news out there? Do you need a script for \u201c vagisel\u2019 cream? I live in Cape Town, not sure if we have the same creams - can anybody please let me know the ingredients in Vagisel",
