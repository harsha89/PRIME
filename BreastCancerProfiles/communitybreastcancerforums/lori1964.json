When my shoulder/arm hurts I elavate it with a pillow.  I also stretch it out.. You should be stretching your arm everyday.  I learned a few weeks ago that I sleep with my arms curled up that is a problem when you LE.  I have learned to start out sleeping with my arm elavated.  It has seemed to help.  Hope it get s better. ",

I think it just shocked her about my side because the way my progress has went with my therapy that where my pain is it shouldn't be.  I get the complete work over from my therapist.. When I see her I am with her about 45 mintues to an hour.. She also runs the pump on my arm.  I am just trying to believe that the pain I am feeling is because of some kind of fluid sitting there.. I am just glad tomorrow is Tuesday and that I'm going.... So many thoughts run through my mind.. Thanks for the support....... ",

Well the next week it happened again.  I mentioned it to her and the look on her face lead me to believe that, that shouldn't be happening.. she suggested I talk to my oncologist when I see him in Dec.  Well I have freaked myself about what it could be and I am seeing my Rad Doctor Tuesday about it.. I have scared myself into believing that my cancer has come back.. It's a dull pain, just enough for me to freak out about it.. I haven't been freaked out for along time...  I was just wondering if anyone else has expierenced pain in the side from lymphedema.  I am hoping it's just fluids but everywhere I look for information it only explains the fluids laying in the arm or armpit..   Any input would be appreciated..  I went through Chemo June 2006 to Sept. 2006. Then 7 weeks of radiation.. So it's been almost two years since radiation.. I want to believe that it's still side affects but not sure..
