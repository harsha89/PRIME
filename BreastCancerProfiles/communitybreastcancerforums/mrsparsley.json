I went ahead and took the other dose after the appt , good excuse to have hubby take me out to eat! So far I haven't been nauseous, knock on wood, but chemo nurse said that it might kick in in a few days. Thanks for the tips! Happy thanksgiving!",

I have just had my last chemo last week and now my foob is red from the middle all the way down, the whole breast. I thought at first it was just my usual chemo flush I get after chemo, but it didnt go away after the weekend. It doesnt itch, isn't unusually hot and I dont have a fever. I made an appt today with my PS. He prescribed me 2 antibiotics. My rash doesnt quite sound same as yours but I just cant believe that really after all this time NOW I get an infection (maybe). PS said if antibiotics dont clear up he may have to go back in!  Ugh ",

I think I have some fluid build up but not a lot. I still wear ace bandage more for myself than anything else. My drain sight is still sore but afternit being in place for 9 weeks what could I expect. I started my chemo yesterday. All went well I was really nervous but for no reason at the time. I did have a headache all afternoon and into evening. I wasn't sure if ot was the chemo and meds or that I only had 1 cup of coffee, or that I didn't sleep well the night before, or that I of course was stressed. Today is a little better I did go to work until I have to leave for my shot of neulasta. My chest and face are bothe red.? I read it could be from the decadron but will ask when I see them in a bit. I also felt a little anxious this morning maybe also from the decadron. I haven't taken my second dose yet for today. I might wait till I see them. Hope everyone is doing well! Happy Thanksgiving!",

My emotions are a wreck and I feel Ive let myself down bc I didn't get the answers I wanted. I didn't ask the questions I wanted. I want to know what happens if it NEVER SLOWS DOWN! I will still have started chemo then nothing will heal. I left In tears. I think I'm gonna have to call back and ask the questions I didn't get answrred. I'm gonna take my husbands advice and try to apply more pressure to the area. His thoughts are if pressure is applied then the fluid has nowhere to build up.
