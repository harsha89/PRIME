I started with .5 mg. and lately I have been taking 3 mg. every night. I sleep better and wake up a little more refreshed but it's killing my memory. Since I've been taking it for so long I would have to be detoxed to get off of it but there are days when I'm so thankful I have it, not just for sleeping but for those occasional panic attacks I get when all this becomes a little too real.",

Sorry to be blunt, but maybe this isn't the forum for you. *susan* Why wouldn't this be the forum for me?  People have recurrences of breast cancer and it's not an automatic death sentence for every patient and I feel that a doctor telling me it will be is insensitive. I felt like he is pushing his agenda because that's how he makes his money. Imagine if everybody refused chemo, radiation, etc. What would the oncologists do?  I'm sorry to hear yours has come back. I'm fortunate that we live in a free country and I can choose how much, if any, treatment I want for myself.",

Their father died in August of 2010 of lung cancer after what seemed like a very long 3 year battle. They are afraid of being orphans even though they are adults. I guess if they don't discuss it, it isn't happening. My oldest was in the hospital when I awoke from surgery and stayed with me for hours. Now I rarely hear from him. Yes, he's working full time and going to college so I cut him some slack. I know if I asked him for something he would do his best. My youngest \"couldn't handle it\" so only visited me in the hospital for about 10 minutes. My sister was there in the hospital and came here with a meal the day after I came home but I rarely hear from her now and she lives 30 minutes away. The only time I hear from her now is when she invites me to go out somewhere with her. LOL - that's really what I feel like doing right now. Thankfully I am living with my mother for awhile so I'm not alone. Until I got BC I truly didn't understand what a person with cancer needs. Your family is probably coming from a place of fear, denial and misunderstanding. That's why I'm glad we have this place to come to.",

We had 2 small children, lots of financial problems, etc. and I just couldn't muster up the desire. Many men seem to think they just have to tell you they are in the mood and that's all we need to get aroused. After awhile sex became one more chore on my \"to do list\" and as we were having sex, I was making mental notes of all I had to do the next day between my job and my boy's schoolwork. Sex seems to stay great for men no matter how many years they are married. Sometimes I envy them that. But now I don't have to please anybody when I'm not in the mood. Perhaps it's selfish but worrying about pleasing someone else sexually right now would annoy the hell out of me. Denise",
