She was diagnosed with a 2cm tumour and had 1 lymph node involved in July 2011 . She had ct scan, bone scan and liver ultrasound (Aug 2011) which showed cysts on her liver before her chemotherapy started. (no mets found) Start of March she had her ct planning scan for radiotherapy. She said then she went and had the X-Ray simulator and has started treatment.She then was told something was shown on the ct scan and now has been told to go for an ultrasound. The lady seemed so confused and upset and i could not really comfort her because I have never heard of this before. I even thought that the CT Scan would be more definitive than an ultrasound for liver mets. The lady seems to be going through hell just now.  I have never met anyone who this seems to have happened to. ",
