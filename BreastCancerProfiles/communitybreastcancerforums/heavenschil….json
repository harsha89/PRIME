Do not use wash cloth and pat dry Lotions: Look for no dyes, no parabens, as pure as possible...100% Aloe: Fruit of the Earth, RO Suggested: Aquaphor for later weeks of treatment, Other Suggestions: Glaxal, Baby Aveeno, Miaderm (purchase on Internet) Boiron's Calendula (lotion, cream, gel) Always go in clean and lube when you go out. Lube 3-5 times a day Treat your skin delicately. It's being assaulted! Tank tops, Camisole's with shelf bra, Fruit of the Loom front hook athletic bras, Everything Cotton and loose that you can stand. Buy a yard of white fleece, and cut to fit inside \"bras\" so something soft is next to rads area. If you are larger breasted, be concerned about underneath your breast and treat with care. Absolutely NO lanolin or oil prior to treatment. Avoid Lanolin during treatment Do not wear deodorant or shave the rads underarm. Breathe through the process: Consider counting the timing of the treatments, visualize the \"healing\" beam. Ask for music to be played and a warm sheet/towel if available. Consider naming the machine: Bubba, Sparky, The Accelerator, Trilogy If the position you are in for radiation hurts your arms or back consider taking ibuprofen or something prior to your appointment...ask your RO about this for recommendations. Enjoy your tattoos if you get them. They little blue dots to add to the constellation of your body! Drink Lots of Water Eat Plenty of Protein to help health skin heal Do not take extra anti-oxidants Fatigue is real. Plan for it. Some can take naps and be better, other's can't. Try to plan your days so you don't wear yourself out.",
