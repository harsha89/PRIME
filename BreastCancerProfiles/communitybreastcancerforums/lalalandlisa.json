After her surgery I found out through my not so informed sister it was in her lymphnodes stage 2-3?? and she needs 6 tx chemo/6 radiation. That is it for me being updated on her prognosis. Until I meet this wonderful optimistic woman named Jo from the mamosite.com whom lives in Queenscreek,Arizona near my mother SunLakes AR. I arranged for Jo to call to help me out,she did.  My moms cancer has spread ,I have NO idea anything else, I found out her surgeon and oncologist name through Jo who has the same Dr. just a MIRACLE which I BELIEVE DOES  HAPPEN. I called the Dr. to see how my mom is doing and to find out about a gene test. I was told I am not on the family history what a heartbreak is that. No info. allowed to her 1st biological daughter.  Being the first born 50 years old ,2 beautiful teen daughters in calif. We feel WHY -HOW COME? my mom is not a warm person, it is unfair and cruel. My grandmother died of this cancer and my mom is 66 years old. please help me ,if someone can give advice  Do I have any rights? aching and tears lisa Lisa McDaniel Log in to post a reply",
