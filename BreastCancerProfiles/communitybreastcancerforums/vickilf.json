I eneded radiation way back in Oct 2011 and here it is June and I am still having breathing issures.  I've always had asthma, but now my medications doen't seem to be working, I just can't breath very good anymore.  I'll look up the chostoehondritis and see what it says.   Any other help from anyone is appreciated.  It is so hard to go to work when a person can hardly breath.  I'm already on Glutathione, Advair, and other breathing medications, they just aren't working all the time, still short winded.",

I feel drained especially today. I too have asthma and allergies and take lots of medication for my breathing problems.  So I think it is natural to be tired. After radiation I was more tired  then ever. Never had Chemo, I think it would do the same thing or worse yet.",

If anyone has any help as to what questions we should ask please tell us.  My doctor said I would have radiation, not chemo, Why?   After my doctor said I have breast cancer I went into a fog.  Last year in March 2010 I was told I had CLL Cronic lymphacytic leukemia, now breast cancer, pinch me I'm dreaming.  Anyway I'm sure we both want to know what to all ask or do,. Mamogram 2, was told no cancer Mamogram 6 months later, tech said don't worry, everything looks fine. Told need biopsy, now cancer , Told invasive ductal carcinoma,  MRI next.  What can they tell from a MRI? Is Chemo better or Radiation? What questions should we ask?",

I also have another cancer CLL and am now waiting for the results of 2 ,biopsies in my throat. I pray it isn't another cancer.  Cancer doesn't run in my family. I believe I got my cancers from taking prescription drugs, so I am hesitant about taking Femara. Thank you for this site and my CLL forum, these forums really help! Hopefully they find a cure for all cancers real soon so none of us have to go thru this again. Vicki.",

My body was so inflammed after taking statin drugs Lipitor, Mevacor and Zocor, I could hardly move. I also got nerve and muscle damage and after taking Lipitor, I couldn't get up off the floor, I could hardly walk. Months later I developed CLL, Chronic Lymphocitic Leukemia, cancer of my immune system, bone marrow, blood. I went back  thru all my medical and lab records, 16 yrs. of hundreds of records and noticed after the Statins my lymph and WBC started going up. Then when you have CLL you get other cancers. I believe my cancers were caused by the the cholestrol lowering drugs, Statins, my oncologist said he thought so too. We both think my two cancers were caused by Statin drugs, a overly prescribed prescription drug..",
