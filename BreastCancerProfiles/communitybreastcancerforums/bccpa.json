Would love to be on FB group too in case I don't log all the way onto this blog. Good luck to all the port placements, I know they are wonderful during treatments, keep that in mind! ",

Update us when you all are ready, we will be waiting patiently! DCIsinAZ - I love the picture, that cracked me up and yes, we all need those installed...I they should be in the lobby of our island bungalow too! Rosa - welcome to the group, sorry for your diagnosis and initial findings but know that we are a group here to love and support you, find humor with you and discuss anything that you want. Stephy - welcome to the group as well, I agree with lots of the others in that the decision is hard, I found comfort in doing the testing that my dr wanted me to do and fortunately all the tests pointed to the same procedure, a lumpectomy.... I felt comfortable with that and had one 12/6, when he didn't clear the margins and I had a positive node, I again had the opportunity to decide again, since nothing else had changed I stuck with my original decision. Listen to your doctors and results of testing.... don't hesitate to get a 2nd or 3rd opinion, just to feel more comfortable with your line of thinking (I got 3 opinions, one would not even do a BMX if I wanted one!). We are here anytime to ask questions or vent to. Anyone interested in participating in a secret FB page? The chemo blog group has one that I am in and it works out real well. Let me know if anyone is and I can ask my teenagers how to set it up! ",

I had two lumpectomies in Dec (2nd to clear the nodes and put in a port) I had 1/3 nodes affected....so I just had my 2nd chemo last Friday. I am in a wonderful FB chemo page that is so full of info and help, let me know if you want in on it and I will give you the leaders name.... but really, these days chemo is not that bad... yes, you will probably lose your hair, and your energy will be a little less some days, but really there is not much sickness at all and you will feel strong and in control....so if the dr suggests it, go for it, it isn't bad and you will be so happy to kick cancers butt out even more... I'm so proud of the rest of you, with all your stories, encouragement and support for each other..... this truly is a place to laugh and cry together! ",

I know it is hard, but try to remember the magnificent road to health that so many woman before have paved for us in this journey, you can beat this....be glad it was caught now and not 2 years from now when the journey is that much harder. Chemo of yesterday is so much better, believe me, 7 days into round 2 and I am feeling good, probably back 95% already. You can and will do this and lots of woman will be here supporting you, thru tears and laughter, we will help you. There is a private FB page for chemo ladies (chemo ladies january 2017) that you will have to join, it is more info and humor than you would believe. Give yourself time to mourn not being in the clean nodes club and then come join us in the chemo club and we will kick cancers a.... together! Virtual hugs to you!!! Vicwytch - I too had a rash, it was from the chloraprep, it was awful, had to get on steroids to fight it...all under my armpit and under my boob....actually took a picture of it, uploaded it and sent it to my dr to see if he wanted to see me for it, he didn't bring me in but called in a script....had to end up laying around with my pit up and a fan drying it out....very attractive! if it gets too bad, just call the dr!

I was diagnosed on 10/31, went thru testing and appts until first lumpectomy on 12/6, didn't clear margins and had 1/3 positive nodes so another lump and port implant on 12/20 then started chemo on 1/6. I had a hard weekend - and finally felt good yesterday and overdid it, had a 99.7 fever by 4 and had to take a nap (I don't think I have napped during the day since college). I am feeling good today but will pace myself today. Fightinggirl - I have been been thinking about you, the waiting is a hard part - for me, I just expect the worst and if it comes when your hubby isn't there (mine wasn't) after your done, just call him, its fine to cry or scream over the phone, that is what they are there for. So many good thoughts to you for good results but know that no matter what you find out, you have got this!!! docmama - so sorry to read about you sister, I agree with everything fightingirl said, I just turned 50 in Dec and did the genetic testing as well (it came back clear) but know that daughter and sister and even mom are at increased risk. you and your sister can share this journey together use that to both of you advantages! thanks again for all the words of encouragement and humor, I have needed this.... sometimes I have felt alone in this journey, and I know it is really just beginning for me.

Take your time recovering after tomorrow, allow others to help you and take care of you, your body needs your energy to heal, stay up on your meds and don't wait for the pain to really kick in, you can do this! I have to say that my surgeon had gotten me excited about the 5 day SAVI and when my lymph node was involved I felt crushed, almost wish drs wouldn't get hopes up when dealing with this stuff. Anyway, good luck tomorrow, we will be here for you as soon as you are ready to come back! ",

At that point they were thinking it was small enough and no nodes looked involved so thinking of just lump and then 5 day radiation and I could be \"done\" with treatments. I got very excited about that thought and didn't really tell anyone. After my lumpectomy they found it was much bigger than thought 1.8cm and 1/3 nodes was affected so chemo was a must, and they didn't clear the margins....I was so sad that day. I have to say that after talking to the oncologist and the radiologist that I learned why those treatments are so successful and while they aren't fun or quick, they can be very effective, so if you need them, or they think you do, now is the time to do them. The decision between lump and BMX is a big one, but don't wear yourself out on it, the testing and the drs will point to the best option for you. DSMom - glad your home and feeling well too! Bevmomduck - so glad for clear scans, that is worth celebrating for sure! Does everyone's energy level seem to be really high sometimes and then just tank? I am hoping it is a symptom of all of this because I have never been so exhausted after so little exercise - it amazes me how I have so many thoughts and plans and how little I get done because my energy is just gone so quickly. I am a CPA with a small tax practice and I have to say that I am getting very concerned as to my energy with my job and the upcoming tax season! ",
