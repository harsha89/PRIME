      "Content": "GratiaPlena wrote: Like others, I've hesitated writing because I know so many people here have gone through incredible tribulations, and I felt I would be melodramatic for posting just a \"worry,\" but I guess that's why this particular board is called \"Not Diagnosed but Worried,\" so here I am. I'm a 31-year-old mother of 2. I breastfed both children. No family history of breast cancer or even any strange lumps or anything, though we do have a very impressive history related to the rest of the female-specific anatomy, myself included. Anyway, several months ago, I noticed on my left breast what looked kind of like a faint \"stork bite,\" the kind of red spots that newborns often have. I thought it was a little weird, and it definitely looked nothing like the creamy skin of my other breast. But this mark was new(er) (had never noticed it before but wasn't really looking) and just above my areola, so not near my stretchmarks. I do have a number of stretch marks on both sides near my armpits from ballooning from a D to an H cup when pregnant and breastfeeding. I have lost a lot of weight since the peak of my pregnancy (down to 140 from 200), and I'm now a DD, or at least that is what I wear. Since having my second child 1.5 years ago, I've had a hard time finding a good-fitting bra because my left breast is at least one cup size bigger than my right. I have always been very lumpy on the sides of my breasts, mostly where my stretch marks lay. I think I never really did BSEs because of my fibrous girls. But a few nights ago, the urge struck me to do a BSE. In addition to feeling around, I did a visual check in the mirror, and the stork bite area caught my attention. I looked down, and it seemed like there was a slight dip or depression on the red area. I leaned forward to let the breast hang, and the indentation became much more prominent. I lifted my breast up, and again, the indentation was very prominent. Underneath the indentation, right below the skin, I could feel something. It feels like a hard vein. It's firm, narrow, and long. I can trace it from the top of my indentation, maybe 2 inches above my areola, down into my areola. I asked my husband to look, to see if I was imagining the indent, but he noticed it right away. Upon much deeper palpation, underneath my nipple (inside my breast), I think I can feel a pea-sized lump. But it's not near the hard-vein-type thingy, it's deep, and I don't know if it's just more of my typical lumps. I never did a \"deep\" palpation before. Also, since I am now obsessing about my boobies, I have noticed in the mirror that my left nipple is significantly lower than my right one. Bless you if you've read that. I can get long-winded. I am scheduled for my yearly GYN check in 2 weeks, so I haven't phoned the doctor for an appointment; I figure I will mention and demonstrate my indentation or crease at that time. Also, as anybody else who's noticed an indentation surely knows that Dr. Google screams, \"CANCER CANCER CANCER,\" if using any search terms that include \"breast\" and \"indentation.\" Either this post will further corroborate that creases are not good at all, or, hopefully, I will provide an update that shows a crease can be normal. I did read online about Mondor disease, or a thrombophlebitis of the breast, but everything I read says that is a painful condition; this is pain-free. Perhaps it can be painless though and I've just missed those articles. If anyone was so inclined to give any thoughts, they'd be very appreciated. I'm trying to stay calm, but I've learned hard lessons about statistics. My 59-year-old mother died quite unexpectedly from a scheduled heart surgery that has a 98% success rate. So when you're on the bad side of a statistic, the numbers don't mean anything. Again, I'm sorry for being long-winded, but this is a gem of a community and board for people like me who can't help but start thinking the worst. Log in to post a reply",

I decided to call my PCP to see if I can calm my fears sooner than 2 weeks from now, but she has no appointments this week. So I might as well just wait for my GYN. And thank you for the advice on not letting anybody brush it off. My GYN is an extremely proactive doctor, so I doubt he would, but it's good to be prepared for that since I wasn't at all expecting it. You are all very wonderful women to be here providing support to others. ",

She didn't give any insight into what she thought of it and didn't seem to be willing to take a guess even. She did dismiss the idea of Mondor disease and said it doesn't present like that at all. She suggested it could be a clogged milk duct, even though I haven't breastfed in a year. But I have had plenty of those, and they HURT. Anyway, I guess I'll have more insight next week. She said a mammogram, in her opinion, would be a waste on me with the density of my breasts, but depending on the ultrasound, I might see a breast surgeon and have more tests. So let the waiting continue! ",
