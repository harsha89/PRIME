I'll go for lumpectomy soon, within a week or two, then start chemo 3 weeks after. I'm getting mentally geared up for that while trying to just take one step at a time. I had a good talk with a family member of a friend who is just closing up her treatment. She went through vigorous chemo due to finding her cancer in Stage 3 with 5 tumors in her breast. She had chemo, mastectomy, chemo, then radiation. She gave me some good tips and was so positive about the whole experience and where she is now. She's finally back to work and feeling more like herself again. I know this is not where any one of us would choose to be, but hopefully we can find some peace in our hearts to embrace the journey. And punch our cancer in face!",

I've really contemplated asking one of my docs for something Xanax or something because I have moments where I feel my heart is racing and I can't catch my breath. I've had anxiety at other times in my life so I am familiar with the feeling. I haven't asked a doc yet, but would be completely shocked if i was told no or questioned about the need. Hello??? We just got one of thee most dreading diagnosis a person can get! Stay strong ladies!",

I'm in California, so it's 11pm here right now. My appointment is tomorrow at 9am. I am not nervous now, but I'm the kind of person that is generally ok up until the actual moment. I'm afraid I will have a panic attack once they call me back into the infusion room. Thank you for adding me to your Rosary list. Hoping you're doing well with the steps you are in now.",

Ingerp- I had first AC on 5/17 and those first 3 days I could barely stop eating! Along with my chemo infusion I had decadron which is a steroid. I read one of the side effects is increased appetite. Not sure if anyone else also had this experience. In any case I ate what i wanted because I figured at some point I may not have an appetite. Ice cream is certainly one of my favorites right now. Although as of yesterday the appetite certainly did slow down and nausea started setting in. Libbylou- I'm on an automatic cycle with nuelasta. I will get the nuelasta shot the day after each of my AC treatments. To prevent a severe drop on white blood cell count. I've read many have sever bone pain with neulasta. My doc recommended taking claritin day before, day of and day after the nuelasta to minimize pain. I think it's probably worked. I have had some aches and bone pain, but not severe. Except for on day 2 after shot....I was feeling really bad for about 2 hours in the afternoon. I rested and then woke up feeling better. So far, manageable.  Ultra- You said it! You do what you gotta do!! This definitely isn't an easy road to travel and I still can't imagine when I have no more hair on my head. But it is what it is. There isn't a choice. So, we take the time to feel whatever it is we're going to feel and do the best we can to care of ourselves. :) Everything I have experienced so far is \"manageable\". Not always pleasant, but manageable. One day at a time.",

      "Content": "May 15, 2018 09:10PM - edited May 15, 2018 09:16PM by foreverfaith Hi All. I'm starting AC on 5/17. So much has happened in such a short amount of time. My tumor originally measured 1.5cm but upon lumpectomy came out 2.8cm. Changed the game a little, not so much in terms of the treatment medications but rather the urgency top start chemo. I'm triple negative with makes it a little more urgent as well. After 4 rounds of AC every two weeks I will go into 12 weeks of weekly taxol. So I've cut my hair short. I had hair past the middle of my back. Thankfully one of my best friends is also my hair dresser. It made the process so much easier and memorable (in a not so bad way).My chemo counselor said it's guaranteed to lose my hair on AC and usually happens 2-3 weeks after the first infusion. I started preparing the things I will need at home and for the bag I take with me to infusions. It seems so surreal. I've read so many threads and the truth is that it varies widely. Some not so great and some not so bad. My husband and I have tried to prepare our family (we have 3 kids - 10,13 and 22) as best as we can without making it seem too scary. Anyone take any special precautions with school age kids at home? I am super paranoid of anyone bringing germs into the house where I may end up sick, as in getting a virus that ends up landing me in the hospital. I feel so sad when I read the posts of the members that have gotten so sick during chemo that they have to be hospitalized. Also, has everyone chosen to get a port? My doctor said it was my decision whether or not to get one.",
