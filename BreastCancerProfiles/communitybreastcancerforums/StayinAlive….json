I feel very blessed as far as health, I've had no major issues except my numbers dropped below 200 once during a med vacation thus the AIDS diagnosis.  There are lots of side effects I've dealt with over the years with this but it's like you know what your dealing with.  Cancer seems so sneaky.",

I've been to so many specialists and they can't seem to figure it out.  As it is I live on Zofran every six hours or I'm puking my guts up.  I can't afford to loose any more weight and the notion of even more nausea/vomiting plus loosing my hair frightens me to the core. So the surgeon said that what I had done was the chemical equivelant to a masectomy.  I don't understand what she means by that this is all so new and surgeons are not well known for big long explanations and hand holding.",
