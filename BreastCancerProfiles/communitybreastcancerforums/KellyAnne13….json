I get my mapping CT done next week and then should start some time the following week. I think I have been kidding myself about how easy it will be. After AC chemo I keep thinking everything will be easy. Last week I had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and mistakenly expected it to be simple. I cried for 3 days after I was in so much pain from the CO2 gas. Otherwise I have been doing well but saw a counsellor yesterday at the cancer agency who was very helpful. I am making it a priority to do some research on what it is actually like so that I can mentally prepare myself. And so that I can give myself permission to have meltdowns when I need them! Kelly",

We often did procedures on face, neck and chest but as a rule only did two at once because of the lido limitations. Ex: face and neck. We also slathered it on quite thick. This might give you an idea as to what you can safely use. The odd person would feel unwell, but we just wiped it off and it would settle",

I had a BMX with one TE insertion on Sept 21 (the other had major complications and now can't be done until after rads). Anyhow I guess I thought that after the BMX this would be a walk in the park but it was not. The first 3 days were very very painful from the CO2 gas they fill your abdominal cavity with. Honestly, it was worse than being 9 months pregnant. On top of that, I guess because I expected it to be so easy, I was an emotional wreck. It was very difficult to be just starting to feel better and then, wham, be hit with one more thing. Having said all of that, it is day 4 and I have definitely turned a corner. Not too much pain, although I'm still moving gently. I can walk and drive, and even painted my bathroom today (slowly). So... be prepared for the worst and then be pleasantly surprised if it ends up better than that. If there's one thing I've learned from all of this it's to expect the unexpected. I would agree with the 2 weeks off work. Good luck!",
