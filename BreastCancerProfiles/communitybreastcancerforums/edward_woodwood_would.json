    "Content": "edward_woodwood_would wrote: Hi, I've just left the bedside of my 39 year old fiancee. Two weeks ago she had her first Epi and has a serious infection which has seen her spend the last 5 days on IV antibiotics and saline, with her temperature all over the place. She also had two shots two increase her white blood cell count. She has suffered from Crohn's disease for 20 years, and the oncologist says it has flared and an abcess is present, so, no more chemo, and now an operation on the bowel. Her BP is extremely low, also. I guess my question is, has anyone else not had chemo because of a similar problem? Is there anything else we can do? She will be having ovarian ablation, and tamixifen. We don't do oncotype testing in the UK, so all we really know is ER+ HER-. We need to do whats best for our young family. Thanks.
