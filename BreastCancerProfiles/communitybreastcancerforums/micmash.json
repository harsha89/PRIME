Now I just wait for the results which will be in in the next 2-3 days.  Thanks for all the support on here, what a wonderful place for us all to come together. ",

I am having a biopsy today on a 1cm suspicious mass on the right breast. My surgeon showed me the mass which showed up on ultrasound and it looked almost like a jagged starfish or something. Have any of you had one of these that turned out not to be cancer? I am really scared and seem to have myself convinced it is cancer.  I also have a fibroedenoma (at least they are pretty sure thats what it is) on my left breast that is 6 cm.  I am having a bilateral lumpectomy on the 19th to remove both lumps. This is not how I thought I would be starting my summer and I am just terrified I will be added chemo/radiation to the mix. I am only 31 so any advice or support would be greatly appreciated. I had a few responses on my last post that the biopsywould not hurt just be uncomfortable. I hope so. I think I am more nervous just cause I do not know what to expect.   Thanks so much~ Log in to post a reply",

My mom was diagnosed with BC when she was 42 years old was in remission for a few years then it returned and spread and she passed away when she was 49. A few months ago I felt a lump in my left breast while in the shower. I finally went to see my doctor 2 weeks ago who referred me to a breast surgeon. I went to see the breast surgeon she sent me for a mammogram and ultrasound. The mammogram tech kept taking me back for more pictures which sort of freaked me out. Then i went off for my ultrasound. The tech doing that had issues seeing anything on my right breast but kept looking. The following day the breast surgeon called me at home and informed me she was \"pretty sure\" the lump on my left side was a fibroadenoma but that she wanted to biopsy it anyways. Is that normal even is she is sure its a fibroadenoma? She also said because it is so big she wants to remove it. Then she told me there was something suspicious on the ultrasound of my right breast and she wants to biopsy that also.   For any of you that can answer my questions are....  Will the biopsies hurt and what should I expect? What is the surgery for a removal of a fibroadenoma like? And should I be worried about the suspicious ultrasound on my right breast? Does it mean for sure I probably have cancer? I am only 31 and terrified given my family history.  Log in to post a reply",

I think I could deal with needing the lump remove etc if I wasnt paniced about the \"suspicious\" spot on my ultra=sound. I go see my doc tomorrow and I am not sure if she will be doing the biopsies then or not. I guess for me when I hear biopsy I automatically think cancer. :( Thanks again for the responses I really appreciate it. Anyone else also with any input I would appreciate it. What other things can cause abnomalities/suspicious spots on an ultrasound? Am I freaking out for no reason?",

Everyone keeps telling me it wont hurt but I am still freaked out. Saw the doc on Wednesday and she showed me the pics from my mammo and ultrasound. The fribroedenoma on my left is so big. 6 cm. But it was oval and round and all the edges were nice and smooth so she said she was certain thats what it was an not worried. However the 1cm lump on the right breast was taller and not smooth. Almost like a jagged starfish or something along those lines. I am really scared this means it is cancer. Has anyone had something look similar to that not turn out to be cancer?  I also have surgery on the 19th to have both lumps removed regardless of the biopsy results. Next Friday I go to see a Genetic Councelor also to be tested for the breast cancer gene. WHat a whirlwind. I NEVER go to the doctor and by the end of this month I will have been to 10 appointments including my surgery. And depending on the results of the biopsy who knows what else. ",
