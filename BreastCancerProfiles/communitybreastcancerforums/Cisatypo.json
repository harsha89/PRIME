Took a class on trigger point therapy and one  stretch that we did felt particularly good (basically, it was a partner stretch  like being on a rack = pulled from feet and arms at the same time). I asked the instructor if there was a way to do that stretch by yourself and she said the equivalent would be hanging from a bar. So while at the park with grandchildren, I hung from the monkey bars. Huge burning sensation and pain in entire surgery site but I hung in there for perhaps a minute. Voila! After that one hang, the discomfort, pain and residual swelling was almost gone and has stayed gone.  Dr. says I likely broke up some very old internal scar tissue from the surgery! It didn't make a difference to my mild arm l ymphedema but it sure made my mobility and QOL better! So I think everyone who has surgery anywhere should ask a trainer what stretches may break up even old scar tissue! Who would have thought the right prescription would be: Monkey bars!",

And whether the COPD is a result of that or not? I think, hope, pray, that cancer at least brings us empathy and compassion, rather than \"I am so much worse off than you therefore I get to judge you\".  If individual accountability means \"whatever disease you have, it is your own doing\" then we all have lost, don't you think? Your ascerbic wit and unfailing humor has seen many of us through, but I always thought you care for everyone no matter what death they may face.",
