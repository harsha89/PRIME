I don't want to necessarily compare, and I definitely don't want a diagnosis, but I just need to know if I'm looking out for the correct symptoms and signs. It all started when I noticed small redish-yellow bumps surrounding my areolas, and then I noticed red patches going up my breasts toward my collar bone, and then little spider veins all over my breasts. These small red bumps and my nipples are very sore and sensitive to the touch. They're so sensitive, in fact, that just my shirt brushing against them hurts. I noticed one of the lumps formed on my left nipple, along with a small white bump. Then I noticed one of my armpits was swollen and sore to the touch. My right nipple appeared considerably smaller than it usually is, and the skin of my breasts seem more elastic than before. I've done a lot of research, but I can't seem to find any straight answer to further my research. I just need to know if these are any signs or symptoms that I should keep an eye on and monitor. I have taken Benadryl in the hopes that the rash would disappear, but it didn't. I'm not breastfeeding and never have and I am not pregnant, so that's definitely off the table. Thank you for bearing with me, I'm just sick of running into dead ends in my research. Log in to post a reply",
