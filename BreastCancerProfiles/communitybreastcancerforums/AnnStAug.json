It's pretty short in the back. It's getting me used to a different look. I'm also wearing some cute little skull cups. Easing myself and my family into no hair. I'm sure your heart will guide you to the right decision. Good luck.",

Not a lot just like when the stylist thins it out in one pass with the razor. Nothing to be afraid about ladies.

I told my nurse today I am feeling anxious so she is going to give me a little Valium when I get there. If we plan to think of all the great gals who are starting tomorrow it may help to feel less afraid. I'd like to make a list. Please send me your first names if you are having chemo for the first time tomorrow. I am going to think of us in a circle holding hands and the circle is within a larger circle of the other girls who are having ongoing treatments and the other survivors circling and protecting us. Then all the families and friends and medical staff circling everyone. Please don't think I've lost it!!!",
