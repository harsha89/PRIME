Hair started falling out right at the 2week mark.  Going to get it cut today.  Figure I can have that for about a week before it all goes.  Did my period this week as well, wouldn't mind if that went away. Here's wishing everyone a good day",

Myra 104, I hear you on the constipation.  What are you taking?  I've just been doing some milk of magnesia, but don't want to stay on it for too long.  Also having some hand swelling and pain, but that started after my last AC.",

I am 2 months out from my last chemo and 1 month out from BMX.  Chest still feel very tight, but range of motion in the arms is good.  PT/OT has definitely helped with that, even noticed difference after first session.  Have planning session for rads this week then will likely be starting the following week.  My RO said no fills of my expanders until done with rad, guess I'll just have to wait. Hair very short, but filled in.  Haven't worn hat or scarves for a month.  So sick of them!  My eyebrows are coming in and have very short eyelashes.  Anyone having skin issues?  Arms, legs, stomach all feel like they have very small goosebumps all the time.  I figured it was the follicles and the hair growing in.  Any thoughts?  Stay positive and good luck to all.   ",

Definitely keep up the fluids, I'm trying to do 72oz a day and swishing with the salt/bicarbonate. I fasted about 18 hours prior to chemo, will probably try that again since I felt symptoms were bearable. Hope everyone feels well tomorrow Hillary",

I finish taxol 6/5 and then will have bilateral mast. Followed by radiation.   I meet with the plastic surgeon on Tuesday to get a timeline for the surgery and expanders, etc.    Glad everyone is starting to think about the end of chemo, it's nice to have something to look forward to.  ",

Initially had what was supposed to be lumpectomy for sclerotic lesion found by u/s guided biopsy.  Was found to be cancerous when they went in.  Has +tumor margins so will be getting mastectomy on the R and prophylactic on the L after chemo(just want to get rid of EVERYTHING!!!) Finished chemo about 4.5 hours ago.  Slight pain with the poke to the port, will ask for some Elma cream when I go in for my neulasta injection tomorrow.  Got a slight headache and saw some squiggly lines with the decadron, but only lasted about 10 minutes.  Feeling ok other than a slight headache and kind of rapid HR.  I fasted for about 16 hours prior, had read that this helped with SE, will keep you posted. Hope everyone has a good night and is cancer free by next year.     ",
