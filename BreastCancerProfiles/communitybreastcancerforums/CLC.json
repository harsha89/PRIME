I am not in your wife's boat at all, as you know.  However, reading your post here made me wonder how she is eating and drinking.  Is she drinking lots and lots of water?  My physical therapist keeps reminding me to drink a lot and I notice a difference when I do.  (I am drinking about 3 liters of water a day).  The PT says that it increases healing dramatically.  I know, too, that vitamin C and iron, as well as many other vitamins and minerals, are important for healing.  So...I wonder if she is eating a lot of fruits and veges.  I know that what you are describing probably cannot be solved by diet and water alone, but it certainly cannot hurt and will likely help. Going back to work was tough for me, and made me realize that I was not as recovered as I thought.  It is still a work in progress for me too. Please let her know that I am glad she is doing well and I am hoping for her getting past that wall quickly. ",

I do think that in finding one, it is important to find one with experience with breast surgery at the very least, and a lot better if they have experience with lymphedema, too.  There are women on the LE threads that will have more to offer on this...

      "Content": "Aug 19, 2012 08:31AM - edited Aug 19, 2012 08:34AM by CLC Meh...I am so sorry you find yourself dealing with this.  First, you have gotten excellent advice.  As hard as it may be, try to slow down and take a deep breath.  Avoid googling symptoms, as you need more information about your lump for any googling to be helpful....googling can only be panic inducing right now.  Try to do things that make you feel good...good music, good food, sunshine...:) Second, you are not being selfish to worry.  We all have our different burdens to carry, and there is no comparing one's pain, worry or suffering to another.  One thing you have to do as you deal with this is feel your feelings.  Fighting them makes it more difficult.  Many emotions washed over me repeatedly throughout my diagnosis and surgery.  I just let them fly...and they moved through me and out.  You can do that.  It feels a little like a roller coaster, one minute crying, the next laughing...but it is easier that way.  So feel what you feel. Third, I have two young kids...they were 7 and 10 when I was diagnosed.  It is scary to contemplate our own mortality when we have so much unfinished business raising children.  Keep in mind that cancer does not necessarily mean imminent death.  There are many stages and even with the most advanced cancers, many many women live for long periods of time.  The vast majority of women with breast cancer have excellent prognosis...living normal lives. Fourth, there are a lot of chances that this is actually benign. Fifth, maybe you can give your husband a job.  Tell him you are depending on him...you need him.  You need him to reassure you, even if he doesn't believe it...something like...\"we will get through this together...\"  I had to give my husband very explicit instructions...I said, \"I need to cry.  I need you to hold me when I cry.  I don't need you to say anything.  Please don't leave to get me a tissue.  Just let me cry all over you.\"  I worked really well.  He needed to be needed and he needed clear instructions.  (As an aside, once I was diagnosed and had to tell my children, I gave them jobs, too...and they really felt better having a way to help...) You asked if you might get an answer Tuesday.  I am unclear what you are having done Tuesday...are you having a biopsy, a mammogram, an MRI, an ultrasound, or just an appointment to meet with the gp?  It is unlikely you will have any answers that soon, but it would help us to answer your question fully if we knew what you were scheduled for. I hope that you find a way to stay as calm and relaxed as you can. Thinking of you. Claire",

Most of us know why it has it you so hard.  It is hard.  And many of the women you will meet here are exceptionally strong...and become stunned at how bowled over they get by this.  You are not alone.

EDITED to add in here...really, first, take a deep breath.  Cancer is difficult, really sucks.  But, I have found many women here who continue on in life with strength and find beauty in life, in spite of the difficulties.  Take this one step at a time. First, you should know what stage and grade cancer it is.  You will get that from your pathology report and the doctors.  If you don't know yet, ask.  If they don't know these yet, then ask how they will diagnose the stage and grade.  Diagnostic tests include mammogram, mri, ultrasound and biopsies of various types. Stages are 0 to 4 (usually written in roman numbers...I to IV).  The grade is low to high (1-3).  You will find information on these here at breastcancer.org. at the top of the page under \"Symptoms & Diagnosis.\"  Ask the doctor to explain what the stage and grade means for your treatment plan.  Treatments can include surgery, chemo, radiation and hormonal therapies (drugs).  I am no expert, but I think that is where you start. I wish you all of the best of luck.  Explore the various threads here on breastcancer.org.  Some may \"speak\" to you...and you may find some necessary support.  I know I have... I will be thinking of you. Claire",

I prefer the silicone prosthetic to the lightweight pillow foob because it looks better (it moves like a breast....if I jump, it moves like my remaining breast, for example).  It also feels like a real breast.  I was stunned the day I first tried it on.  It felt like I had my breast back.  If there was pressure on it, it referred back to my chest wall as if there was a breast there.  So, as for the hug test, for me, it is really how I experience the hug more than the person hugging me... I prefer flat, though, because the silicone prosthetic is heavy and presses on my scar and hangs on my shoulder.  It is very freeing to take it off after work! I think it is best if you simply go try some on and see if you like them.  If not, then you don't need it.  Good luck!",

I decided to go to my primary care physician for the pains after my bs and onc said that it had nothing to do with my surgery or dx.  The primary checked me for blood clots and, once that was dismissed, had no answers for me.  However, while I was there, I asked if I could be getting physical therapy and, after a little bit of urgent requesting, he prescribed it.  I am so grateful.  I went to my first appt today and the therapist gave me some gentle, more gradual exercises and also addressed my other pains, which, she said, were directly related to my non-movement after surgery. I had tried to find a pt with direct experience with lymphedema, but could not find one.  But the one I did find has experience with breast surgery and women's health in general.  While she does not treat lymphedema, I think she knows what to look for and will help me navigate returning to full mobility without doing any high risk le behaviors. I just wanted to share this because I had felt very unempowered by the bs' disinterest in pt or le prevention.  I am very relieved that I pursued it further.  I think pt will be very good for me and prevent a lot of difficulties for me. I wanted to share this because there may be others that are thinking about this, just as I was, but not sure if they should pursue it. I hope you all are doing well.  I hope everyone is finding their way in this tumultuous and difficult bc roller coaster.  For those anticipating surgery...and those recovering from it.  For those who are now ready to pick up where they left off in life, only to carry this with them as the life altering event it is and for those who have been hit with unexpected problems, who may feel more that the bc is carrying them.

Gamergirl, I am sorry that fluid build up is giving you such grief.  I hope you find resolution quickly. Kim...PT has been awesome for me.  I had a umx with snb and no recon.  And I was feeling very limited in my movement.  In 4 sessions, I have almost full ROM.  The PT identified a tiny bit of cording in me and is treating it.  I am so grateful I went.  I know someone who had bmx 5 or 6 years ago and never got pt...she still cannot reach above her head....  I cannot recommend it enough.  I would seek out someone who has experience with breast surgery...and better yet, with lymphedema and how to prevent/avoid it.  Mine has only limited experience, but she was the best I could find.  At least she knows how to identify and treat cording.  If I began developing LE, she would presumably be able to recognize it.  ______________ Happy Halloween to you all!!!  And an end to our list of surgeries...:)",

Kelleyod and AJ...YEAH on the path reports!  Nothing like a kitchen fire when you can't do anything to teach you to let go of control...:) I agree with CookieMonster.  We all did take different routes and have different issues to contend with.  (I think I might be one of only a couple of us that has opted to not do recon, and does not intend to in the future...)  I think it is wonderful that those differences have never seemed to matter among us.  I personally contend that there is no such thing as a \"right\" decision, no answer key in life.  There are choices we make.  Then we live with the consequences.  No one else can tell us what consequences we are willing to live with and so no one should tell us whether we made the right choices. IMHO ________________ As for me, I am going back to work tomorrow, something I have been facing with a good deal of trepidation.  I woke up tonight having what I can only guess was a panic attack.  I have never had them, so I don't know.  All I know is that sleep now eludes me and I am quickly approaching the time I have to get up.  Nothing like really testing out how well I've recovered...sigh...  Wish me luck getting through the day of work on limited sleep.  I wish you all resolutions to your current issues and continued recovery on this crazy bc roller coaster....

I am not sure how I would cope if I thought the cancer was going to kill me, though.  My heart goes out to those folks who have small kids that have much more serious diagnoses.",

Perhaps I should be annoyed with myself for wanting affirmation from outside of me.  Perhaps I should be annoyed that this moment came from a relative stranger.  (Though I have no annoyance with my husband on this...he has been a gem...a new role for him, I might add). Again, I know this veers way off topic, but the last two comments raised it for me.  Or maybe it doesn't veer away.  Maybe this is about how we go about feeling feminine or womanly...from self or others...  On another note, I want to wish you all a very Happy New Year!  May the coming year be happy and healthy, strong and fulfilling...

Also, as far as losing a post part way through, I learned that the way to avoid this is to hit \"preview\" occasionally.  If the site locks up, everything you last previewed still comes up...:)  As to the gym question, I don't know the answer yet.  I am one week after surgery and I am walking about 4 mph for about 15 minutes, then tired.  You can read the running thread...I asked them and there is a discussion about what to expect.  You also could start a thread and ask.  (Those runners are a little hard core about getting back to it...they are trying to schedule their half marathons...they are an amazing group)...

The truth is that it all sucks.  I don't want any of this and they don't want any of this.  But, the truth is that we got this.  I feel that I've done the right thing by not waiting until the last minute to talk to them.  This is in part true because if things get worse (they find cancer in a node, say), they will already be in the know about it all.  Last year, I told them everything and it was only ADH and I had only an excision.  That whole conversation last year gave them a context for understanding this year. I don't know what the right thing is to do.  It is probably different for everyone.  But that is how things have played out here...",

I think the whole idea of requiring women to cover up their breasts is crazy.  Many countries do not require it of women.  Once upon a time, here in the US, it was illegal for men to go topless.  And yet, at some point, we legalized that, but not for women.  It has something to do with the illicitness of women...something to do with preventing us control over ourselves and our self-definition.  It becomes so acute in the context of mastectomy. As I go out in public flat on one side, I find I am quite unexpectedly comfortable.  I feel in command of my life and my choices.  I like it.  But I suspect it is not so comfortable an idea for many. When I was in college, I came across a wonderful poster of a woman who'd had a radical mx and she was naked from the waist up with her arms outstretched in the sunshine.  She was smiling and strong.  I loved it, though I had no personal experience or interaction with breast cancer at the time.  I bought the poster and hung it on my dorm room wall.  She seemed so powerful and strong.  I hoped then that I might find that kind of strength in the face of life's trials.  But, many many people who saw that poster were appalled that I had it hung up.  Many of those same people were self-proclaimed feminists majoring in women's studies. I am surprised to find that same strong woman here in myself all these years later.  Life is amazing. You can see the poster at this website:  http://www.fawi.net/BC/heroines.html  (caution, the pictures are bare chested and explicit) It is the second picture.  I forgot to mention that she'd tattoo'd the scar beautifully...",

I think the experience has been one of empowering my daughter as much as it has me.

Immediately, I thought that was argument against reconstruction.  The message I wanted to convey to her was that my beauty and strength was not tied to breasts.  I am glad to realize now that I am succeeding.

Good luck and let us know how it goes! Claire",

My understanding of whether insurance pays for the mri is generally based on the risk assessment using the GAIL model.  If it is over a certain percentage, mri's get paid for.  You can google it and use a calculator right off the web.  My onc used the gail model after the adh diagnosis and found I had a 28% lifetime risk, so I qualified for the mri.  The mri is great, partly because it has a higher sensitivity, but also because it does not increase exposure to radiation, but allows for another check during the year.  In my case, it was the mri that caught the dcis.  Who knows where it would have gotten to if I'd had to wait an entire year, rather than 6 months. I don't know much about cysts, but I think that before you decline the regimen of 6 month testing, you should get a second opinion from a highly recommended bc center/doctor.  I am not one to follow everything the doctors prescribe without question (I will be declining tamoxifen, for example).  However, knowledge is power.

I personally completely understand your feelings on this.  I was on the 6 month merry go round of tests and excisions for a mere year and a half.  When told I needed the biopsy in Sept. 2011, I thought I might consider a pmx even if there was no cancer.  As it happened, I didn't have to face that choice because that time around, they found dcis.  In my case, I only had a umx because all of the issues that ever happened, always happened in my left breast.  If I had decided I wanted both off then, I probably would have had a similar battle, since that surgeon I was talking about above was also my surgeon.  I wish you lots and lots of luck with this.  Hang in there...and don't give up.  Listen to your gut.  You are the one that has to live with the choices.  You should get to make them.

My own personal feeling is that I would do the excision.  Having been there before, I can say that I would do it again.  I had a wire-localized excision of non-cancerous tissue (adh) a year before the cancer showed up.  It confirmed that I had no cancer next to it and that it was just adh.  The adh was completely removed and I knew it wouldn't grow into cancer.   I was out running a week after surgery (albeit with two sports bras).  It was no fun, but I was in and out of the hospital the same day and my breast was just a little smaller than it had been before.  I was back at work the following Monday (surgery was on Friday).  I even went trick-or-treating with my children two days after the surgery. I was very relieved afterwards to know there was no cancer.  A year later, when issues arose, they were the earliest possible moment that one could catch the cancer.   I feel really really really lucky to have caught everything at the absolute first moment.  I don't need chemo, I don't need radiation.  I am not contemplating leaving my children motherless. I don't mean to try to persuade you.  However, I think you should very seriously consider your options.  There are many women on these boards that are facing much more serious circumstances.  I imagine if they could go back and find out earlier in the cancer, they would.  The excision is no fun, but it is totally doable.  Not the major surgery that the mastectomy was. I wish you lots of strength, fortitude, calm, focus and serenity as you try to sort out what is best for you.  These are not easy decisions and no two women will find the same path to be the right path for them. I will be thinking of you... Claire",

As for hair, a woman that I know is a bc survivor who lost her hair.  She is the kind of woman who has real finesse with her appearance and always looks perfect.  It was one of the most difficult parts of the disease for her.  She was able to get an absolutely beautiful human hair wig  with insurance that cost thousands of dollars.  Today, 6 years after being with NED, she still proudly owns and lends her beautiful wig to those who do not have insurance. I know that a wig is not the same, but a wig became a symbol of survival for her.  And strength.  And now meaning from cancer.  She says that she was kept on this earth to be able to help those of us following her, and she is such a wonderful support. I offer you both my wish for your continued strength, faith, courage and determination.",

The key thing about it is that it is fast.  I mean reaaallllly fast.  It's over before you have time to think about it.  That was my experience anyway. My husband watched (he's becoming such a medical pro) and said \"all that came out of her?\"  I guess there was a lot of tubing, but even still...fast.... Good luck with it!",

(I am so glad I didn't hold surgery up for that and I feel such immense relief that, for now, there are no treatments or surgeries on the immediate horizon). After we all just had this big discussion about showing the surgeries to our children, I had a lousy experience with my daughter.  She walked into the bathroom while I was changing.  She just walked in.  I covered up just enough for her to know that I had my bandages off.  She asked to see.  I showed her with very little preparation and she was unprepared.  She was angry that she'd asked to see and that I'd shown her.  We talked at length and it got resolved in the important respects (her, me and trust), but it is going to take some time for her to come to terms with what I actually look like (and, I would imagine, what she might face for herself someday...how could she not think about that?).  I don't think I should have told her more quickly...it was right for me to wait a little.  I don't think I was wrong to show her once she asked because I think that is a reasonable time to share information.  I think the moral of the story is that mastectomy is harsh.  A reality in life that takes some coming to terms with.  But, she knows she has me to lean on, and she will.  She seems much better today. I hope all of you have a very good weekend, whether it is getting ready in anticipation of surgery or coming to terms with the surgery and news you've already had...  I am glad you all are sharing here...it helps so much...",

I have had two stereotactic biopsies.  I had no drugs for either one and they were really no big deal.  I decided to listen to my iPod during the procedures (and they let me).  That blocked out all of the noise and allowed me to listen to music that makes me relaxed and happy.  The nurses had never had anyone ask to do it before, but they had no issues with it either time. In my case, each biopsy had less than ideal results...but 80% of all stereotactic biopsies are benign...so chances are with you. Waiting is one of the hardest things.  While you are waiting, be sure to treat yourself kindly...sunshine, good music...and yes...good food... Wishing you all of the best of luck. Claire",

Denise...the drains are okay...not fun, but okay...  They are not difficult to empty, they are not as gross as they sound...at first, red, then, after a couple of days, they start to run yellowish.  They are not very painful.  I had discomfort with them that I never really identified as them until they were out...that's how mild the discomfort was...couldn't even place it. They are a pain to lug around.  I kept mine in a fanny pack.  Then, when a lot of swelling was down and I put on my snug camisole, it was much easier to carry around.  Wish I'd bought a looser fitting camisole so I'd have had it the whole time.  I was a little nervous about snagging them.  A couple of times, when pulling down my pants, I caught one for a moment and it gave a little tug.  It didn't even hurt.  Just scared the crap out of me!!  But I was fine. Is there anything in particular you are nervous about?  Maria_Malta...thanks for the listing of your le precautions.  Sounds like they are a little more proactive there than here...Yes? Melissah...I think I had a similar ache in the back of my upper arm.  I attributed it to atrophying from sitting around and keeping that arm so immobile.  And, in my case, it has improved, so I am sticking with that answer for now.  However, there is something called cording that the le folks have discussed and it might be worth a question over on the le threads.  I don't know much about it, but someone else was asking about a restrictive feeling and the ladies with le said it might be that precursor they call cording.   _______________________________ As for me...I can say that pt has given me a new lease on life (or at least my left arm and chest).  I am finally feeling some sense of ownership of that part of my body again.  I was feeling so overly protective and like I wasn't allowed to use my own body.  I am shedding that now.  It is very liberating.  Now, I guess the next step is to shed my steristrips...How long will they \"stick\" around???",

Like I said, my experience is likely to be really different than yours, because no TE's.  I think maybe the thing to pay attention to is whether you are gradually improving.  I overdid it one day and layed low the next.  I think that it is partly trial and error...as long as the trials are made with caution...:)",

I should note that I had a umx and have been going flat on the one side (and I am a D on the other) when out and about.  However, I feel like I need to have a form in for work, as I teach teenagers and I feel that it is important not to force any issues with them.  So...I really understand the needing to be approachable thing...    I also really agree with MellyT on the thought that people generally don't actually notice.  Even being lopsided.  I have been surprised at how few people notice when I go out flat. ",

But, from the perspective of having heard it is cancer, and having lived through the certainty of cancer rather than the fear of it coming, and having shared that journey with my husband and two young children, I can say that it is great that you have not been given a diagnosis of cancer.  I hope that you continue to get good good news.  I hope that the testing becomes unnecessary.  I am glad that as long as the doctors think it is, that you continue to be monitored.  I wish you all the best of luck and wonderfully benign results...
