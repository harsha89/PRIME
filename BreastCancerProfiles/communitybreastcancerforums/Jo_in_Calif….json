It's easy to feel down during the holidays, and if you have kids, I think it really makes you think darker thoughts like, \"How many Christmases do I have left?\"  Just know that the holiday season will soon be over, the days will start getting longer, and the sun will start shining more brightly. I am so sorry you are feeling so all alone.  Just know that there are many of us feeling the same way right now...not sure if that's much consolation, but you are not alone. Agree with the OP that you need to find a more positive place to get treatment.  It's not right for them to allow an chemo room to feel drab or depressing.  Let them know why you're leaving if you do decide to leave for another place.  They need to know how the conditions are making their patients feel. Best of luck, and I hope your treatment goes very well!",

Best of luck to you! ",
