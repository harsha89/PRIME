My original bi rads score on my cancer side was a 3, and my family doc thought a biopsy would be a good idea because of family history. Well, we were both shocked when it came back as invasive, with ADH and LCIS. MRI shows a B9 looking lump on the other side, which cannot be seen on us, and makes me uneasy. I am having a skin sparing mastectomy and my PS says my skin is thin and is worried about healing if TE is placed at time of surgery. So, I will be having delayed recon 2 or 3 months after surgery.

I have been doing lots of research, and am still undecided. I am still very stiff and achy across my chest, but have started back to the gym and my yoga mat. Trying to be gentle with things, but really would like to regain as much strength and stamina I can before my reconstruction surgeries. Hope everyone is doing well with chemo, radiation, improved healing, seromas resolving, reconstruction, or returning to work. We certainly all have our unique paths in this journey! I do check in often to see how everyone is doing and hope to keep reading updates on everyone!",

I had my skin sparing BMX 6 weeks ago to the day. My small seroma seems to have resolved, but each side of my chest looks very different. One side has healed quite flat with the extra skin at the ends, and the other side is flat on the ends, with the extra skin in the middle. Keeping fingers crossed that the cosmetic result will be the same - I will see PS on Halloween and will hope to have a date for expander surgery then. I can't wait to be where you are at with fills Profbee! I am becoming more used to my fiber filled prosthesis but usually go without at home. I have decided against tamoxifen ... Weighed risks and possible benefits, took a deep breath and made the best decision I could for me. Hope I am right.",

Everyone told me the first year would be hard. They were right. I am trying to focus on how the events of this year have shown me that I am a strong person, physically, mentally and emotionally. I can navigate the obstacles that life throws at me. Joan, almost done! Even though I know changing the year will not really stop life changing (for the bad or good), there will be something satisfying in not having to write 2011 every day! Here's to a happier 2012 for all the August ladies! Cheers!",

Glad to hear that everyone so far is doing well with their treatments. Doxibell- So happy to hear that you are seeing someone as well. Hope he treats you like a goddess!! I just started my recon surgery. What type are you having? I went in today and had my tissue expanders placed. Feels like I did 100 push ups, 100 chest presses, and rows. I am only taking tramacet, but now wishing I had asked for something a bit stronger. Might be a long night. Not looking forward to another recovery from surgery, my 4th in less than a year, but keeping the end results in mind, and taking it one day at a time. Hope all of you have a Wonderful Thanksgiving next week ( up here it was in October). I know I am more mindful and thankful for the small things since my diagnosis.",

I just saw my PS today, and we are done with filling expanders, and am now waiting for exchange to implants ... In about 6 to 8 weeks. Will be glad to be finished with the reconstruction phase. I get the results of my genetics test next Wednesday. Am nervous but it will be good to know either way. Other than that, my time has been filled with work, kids, and family struggles. A month ago my dad passed, and I have inherited a 2year old poodle, cocker, shitzu mix who has issues with submissive and excited piddling. My 8yr old Shepard mix is not impressed! :P On to dog training classes! I check in often, even if I don't post. Would love to hear more from everyone else too. Sending light, love, and strength to all.",
