It has been on my breast for about 2 months - sometimes it looks like it is completely fading, and then I mess with it again, and it goes back to red.  I have seen my OB and mentioned it to her along with my concern - she said it was absolutely nothing.  I have also shown it to my general practicioner, who said it was nothing.   Because of family history, I had a breast MRI back in Sept, and that was clear.  I have no other symptoms, no puckering, no lump, it's not spreading, isn't hot, doesn't look like a rash.  But, it has been around for about 2 months and has just not healed. Any advise on what to do now?  Two doctors have said it is nothing to worry over, yet I always find myself looking at it, and worrying about it.  Please let me know what you think.   Thank you SO much!
