I had a flare up in my lymphedema which started about 6 weeks ago. I've been seeing my Lymphedema Specialist and she's been doing MLD. I've also been wrapping my arm, not a full wrap but a \"soft wrap\". The swelling is a little better but the tingling and \"pins and needles\" in my fingers and palm is very painful. The therapist mentioned carpal tunnel the first time I saw her but nothing more was said. I've been reading more about carpal tunnel and my symptoms match what I read. I am going to bring this up when I see my therapist next week. In the meantime, I would love to hear from anyone else out there who has/had carpal tunnel. Thank you!!!!

I guess there aren't any easy answers to lymphedema and everyone is different. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be dealing with a complication from Breast Cancer surgery for years after my treatments. Yes, it  does sucks! I also struggle with people asking over and over, \"what happened to your arm?\" as I work in a customer service type of job. At least I am spreading the word about a side effect of breast cancer-lymphedema which very few people are aware of. I am so very thankful I have this forum to visit. It helps to know I am not alone....",

Went to a Lymphedema Specialist, got a sleeve and glove and things were under control for almost 2 years. This summer (I live in a high desert area where it is very hot in the summer) for some unknown reason my arm and hand started swelling again. Went back to my Lymphedema Specialist and she started MLD and showed me how to wrap my arm and hand again. She also ordered class 2 garments for me. Well, the class 2 garments came after being on backorder for several weeks. And the glove didn't fit well and caused my hand to swell even more. So now she gave me a prescription to get a custom made glove. In the meantime, while the glove is being made, she showed me a way to wrap my hand while wearing the sleeve. I am trying to wrap it and leave it on as long as I can each day. When I take it off, my hand is still very puffy. I am so tired of this! I wear a night garment for as long as I can but usually end up taking it off during the night as I can't sleep well with it on. It just seems the wrapping and garments aren't doing much. I am tempted to see a different Lymphedema Specialist but hate to start from scratch again. What do you do when wrapping and/or the sleeve and glove don't help? Thanks for letting me vent. I know everyone here struggles with lymphedema issues. It's such a burden :( Sheri Dx 9/23/2010, ILC, 5cm, Stage IIB, Grade 2, 1/13 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 10/5/2010 Lymph node removal: Left, Sentinel; Mastectomy: Left Surgery 10/13/2010 Lymph node removal: Left, Underarm/Axillary Chemotherapy 11/29/2010 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Taxotere (docetaxel) Radiation Therapy 2/28/2011 Hormonal Therapy 5/14/2011 Log in to post a reply",

Several different types of cancers in our group - prostrate, thyroid, ovarian, lung and a couple of us with breast cancer. It is so helpful to talk with others who have been through cancer treatments and can related to what you are feeling and experiencing. The first few minutes of each session we just sit and chat. Then we spend about an hour doing different exercises, some times as a group, other times on our own in the cardio room of the YMCA. I highly recommend the program! Wishing you all the best!",
