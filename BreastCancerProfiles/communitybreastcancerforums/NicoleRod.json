This is a veterinary drug that people need for their pets and I don't think they will stop selling it because of that. I said I was considering emailing her to get her take on it that was all. I also didn't realize that as you said \"It would take 10 years for the results to be approved, and we'll all be gone by then....\" I thought like you...(since I only have been on the Stage IV train for a month now) that I will be gone before 10 years but lately after hearing from all the positive caring women here I was trying to be positive and based on them all mentioning to me numerous times that new treatments are now being approved every year and there is no reason not to believe that we can live 5 year or 10 and even more years I was starting to think that is quite possible. I guess hearing you say that is little disheartening. I certainly do not want to jeopardize people trying Fenbendazole..that would never be my intent especially since I hope to try it one day myself :) ",

I just wanted to see what she thought of them saying :\" Fenbendazole acts as a moderate microtubule destabilizing agent and causes cancer cell dealth by modulating multiple cellular pathways. That in itself is very interesting. All I wanted was her opinion on that study. There are a lot of studies I will be asking her about. Like another one that I read about using Antimalarial drugs for keeping dormant CTC's from waking up. Now that is pretty interesting. I am just glad people are finding these things to try its great.",

Turns out they only saw \"degeneration\" in the right (I still think its cancer because it feels like the left) but the Left they found 2 mets. She said they are very tiny 1/2 and 1cm or is it mm??>> not sure she just said they are so tiny that, that is probably why the CT Bone scan I had last month in California probably didn't pick it up. They are located 1 in the hip and one in (can't remember the name) but its right near the left tailbone (not the coccyx) and what is also scary is that I have had that pain (in what I thought was my very very lower back, left) for over a YEAR!!! I even went to an orthopedic surgeon over a year ago for it he gave me a steroid pack for it. So I have 3 in the liver 2.0, 1.5 and 1.0. I now need a PET scan. I am so scared of it. Scared they will find more and now of course the pain I been having for months in the left knee is probably mets. :( She did say that my treatment plan will not change. She also said they are tiny if they keep causing me pain because I have pain there that they can eventually after 3 months on the meds, radiate those areas. So I am now on Lupron, Faslodex, Letrozole (yes she is doing that with the faslodex), Ibrance (just started today) and now Xgiva (I will get the first shot of that on my next appointment). She looked at my Foundation One results and said it showed that my cancer should respond very well to Ibrance. She also said she got the tumor markers test back and they were all within normal range.(even though I have heard people say tumor markers are unreliable...) but whatever I need any \"good\" news I can get. Seeing my husbands face yesterday...God PLEASE HELP ME...he is so strong and always so positive and he just looked depleted my heart is breaking for him and yes, for myself.

After my first breast cancer I suffered for 2 years with a recurrent UTI and eventually sought a nurse practitioner in D.C. who had me catherize (my husband did it for me) the antibiotics into my bladder.

I read your post to my husband...he totally agrees with your husband about IF I go first then he can grieve. I am a planner too, but I think most women are...my husband is a Marine so he is a fighter and refuses to surrender lol. I am so happy to hear how you enjoy life. I want to get to that point..and that is my goal. Right now we are so in limbo. We are staying in our sons 1 bedroom apartment with him and his fiancee so I can get to the 3 month mark on these meds and first scan before we head back to Hawaii. It's been so hard here but we also cannot afford to come back and forth. The military is trying to move us to the Northern VA area we are hoping (fingers crossed) by January. Then I will just drive up to NY for my treatments each month it's only about 4 hours. Until then we are here till end of August I am hoping at that time the Ibrance will shrink the tumors enough and they will do a localized procedure then. Then we can head back and get the house ready to move when we go back to Hawaii we could be there for 5 months or so, so I will have to get my injections there but we want to be here for the first 3 months. While it is hard, on the positive side its the first time in years that we are able to live with our son so that is a great thing that I am grateful for. Thanks again for your post. I am going to strive for those things.!! ",

Just wondering is Y90 - SBRT??? or something different?? So I guess I shouldn't be overly hopeful that the ibrance will work on the liver spots? I actually wanted to ask my doctor next week when I go if they would be willing to radiate the spot on the sacrum and the one in the hip?? I just think she wants to wait the 3 months to see what the meds will do. Is this something I should persist about? I welcome all opinions. Nicole :)",

I also wonder if anyone has itchy skin with bumps? I had itchy skin that looked like bites a year and half ago (before I knew I had cancer to the liver ) I went to 6 dermatologists they took samples and everything they could not figure out what it was...it comes and goes...they said it could be an allergic delayed reaction to something I am eating or inhaling yet I did all the allergy testing for every food...for gluten..even went completely gluten free for months thinking it was a gluten skin sensitivity (not Gluten intolerance - stomach) to no avail. Then my husband said he read that problems with the liver can cause itchy skin? They almost look like hives or mosquito bites and no they are not bed bug bites or scabies I had samples taken 6 times and also my husband in over a year and half never had 1 itch nor my son or his fiancee who we have been living with them for over a month. All 6 dermatologist concurred it is not bug bites though they look and feel like that. So does anyone know if cancer in the liver can make you itch?",

Is it uncontrollable diarrhea like you can be out somewhere and have an accident? Is it just like when you actually go to the bathroom it's diarrhea?

I ask that you please do not judge me for my choices and my reasons as to why I am not choosing to reconstruct. Not that anyone would but forums sometimes scare me because people can sometimes be outspoken in a judging way. I am coming to you all for help and support. 1st time was 2014 stage 0 In SITU Right breast. I had cancerous calcifications that were Her2 Negative and positive to estrogen. I had a lumpectomy and radiation. Then, February 5th 2019 they found new cancerous calcifications nearer to the chest bone, right breast again. Her2 Negative again and estrogen positive. My husband is in the Marine Corps and we currently live in Hawaii, I have come to California for my surgery We will be here for the next month or so. I went into this thinking I wanted a double mastectomy (which I still do) but that I would be eligible for implants. Only to find out I wasn't, not without a lat flap or that stomach one (Diep)?? Due to the unpredictable way of the previously radiated tissue. Anyway...after much consideration I have decided not to reconstruct. Not just because of the lengthy process and risks of that surgery, but more because of my feelings about Breast Implant Illness. I have dealt with lingered effects of Lyme Disease and my body does not respond well when anything \"new\" is introduced even stuff that may be healthy or good for someone can react much differently on me because of the lyme. I don't want to make this post any longer than it needs to be so I will get to my questions and not go on and on here lol. Can someone tell me if they know of good store here in San Diego, LA area to buy a good quality bra with prosthesis, I would need this for special events, ie: our sons wedding, the Marine Corps Ball...things of that nature I am not (as of now) planning to wear it all day everyday. But I have heard the better the quality the more comfortable, (especially in petite women, which I am). I also wondered if anyone has a good bathing suit with prothesis they recommend, I do wear a swimming long sleeve shirt when I swim bc of the sun in hawaii so I could wear that underneath if need be. And last but most importantly, any advice you can offer me and my husband about healing after the surgery or tips in general we would love, and welcome. Thank you all in advance.

I am going to be having it done by the nurse at my doctor visits (as far as I know) I know I have to go back in 2 weeks for blood and follow up and for the Lupron...then 2 weeks after that the faslodex (I THINK)....I cannot remember everything she said, next visit I will write it down.

      "Content": "NicoleRod wrote: Hello everyone. My name is Nicole. I am 50 years old. My bi lateral mastectomy will be this coming Monday. This is my 2nd time diagnosed. I ask that you please do not judge me for my choices and my reasons as to why I am not choosing to reconstruct. Not that anyone would but forums sometimes scare me because people can sometimes be outspoken in a judging way. I am coming to you all for help and support. 1st time was 2014 stage 0 In SITU Right breast. I had cancerous calcifications that were Her2 Negative and positive to estrogen. I had a lumpectomy and radiation. Then, February 5th 2019 they found new cancerous calcifications nearer to the chest bone, right breast again. Her2 Negative again and estrogen positive. My husband is in the Marine Corps and we currently live in Hawaii, I have come to California for my surgery We will be here for the next month or so. I went into this thinking I wanted a double mastectomy (which I still do) but that I would be eligible for implants. Only to find out I wasn't, not without a lat flap or that stomach one (Diep)?? Due to the unpredictable way of the previously radiated tissue. Anyway...after much consideration I have decided not to reconstruct. Not just because of the lengthy process and risks of that surgery, but more because of my feelings about Breast Implant Illness. I have dealt with lingered effects of Lyme Disease and my body does not respond well when anything \"new\" is introduced even stuff that may be healthy or good for someone can react much differently on me because of the lyme. I don't want to make this post any longer than it needs to be so I will get to my questions and not go on and on here lol. Can someone tell me if they know of good store here in San Diego, LA area to buy a good quality bra with prosthesis, I would need this for special events, ie: our sons wedding, the Marine Corps Ball...things of that nature I am not (as of now) planning to wear it all day everyday. But I have heard the better the quality the more comfortable, (especially in petite women, which I am). I also wondered if anyone has a good bathing suit with prothesis they recommend, I do wear a swimming long sleeve shirt when I swim bc of the sun in hawaii so I could wear that underneath if need be. And last but most importantly, any advice you can offer me and my husband about healing after the surgery or tips in general we would love, and welcome. Thank you all in advance.

I just told my surgeon tonight how I get extremely consitpated even impacted just from anethesia alone, not to include pain pills. I did a septum surgery (had nose broken) without pain pills, not only do they constipate me but they also make me feel loopy and I hate that. So I am going to TRY to do it with just tylenol. However, if the pain is too bad I will have to take something. The surgeon said they will give me colace but I am very worried it won't work because it took 2 days for the Miralax to work on me after my septum surgery and even then I almost couldn't get it out and was almost forced to go to the hospital. So if you know of any other things to help with severe constipation please let me know. :) My husband is prepared and willing to do everything for at least 3 weeks but I am glad you mentioned about it being \"easy to over do\". I will definitely take that strongly to heart.  ",

They were unable to find the lymph nodes the dye didn't even make it over to them so they consider that good, if the dye can't get to them (due to my scar tissue etc) then the cancer can't either. (they obviously worded it a bit different than me so bear with me LOL) Anyway the other good thing was that my cancer was nearer to the chest bone than the other side by the nodes. They think it was early stage 1. I will get the final pathology results on Wednesday the 27th then I will know if I need chemo. I have done this so far with relatively not much pain and haven't taken any pain meds at all not even tyelenol...except tylenol PM the night I got home to sleep. I feel pretty good and think my scars look really good.   ",

I will heed your advice about the senna. Thanks.

Yea I feel great about my decision. I am not going to lie, I am not being naive about this though. I am expecting to be SHOCKED when I see myself and probably like that for the first few months (hopefully not much more than that and God willing less than that) I know there will be times maybe even quite often where I miss MY boobs\" but again I think it will be MY boobs I miss and not necessarily having implants/boobs. The decision not to reconstruct was very very difficult and if I didn't have Lyme disease I probably would have been a little more apt to go for the implants, but with my health and the Lyme I do not want to put any foreign matter in there. I am blessed to have a loving supportive husband. I just pray I do as he does in the Marine Corps \"Adapt and over come!\" that is my game plan, Lord willing I will do it!. Thank you for supporting my decision and making me feel even better about it. I hope you get some relief from your implants :( Nicole ",
