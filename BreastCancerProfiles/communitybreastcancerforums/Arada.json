We are still having a hard time dealing with her passing (it took while to be able to write this). Just when we thought she was out of the woods things drastically changed. Sometimes you don't know if cancer or the risks that come with chemo is worse- it's like being stuck between a rock and a hard place. Anyway, now she is pain free in Heaven with God. I would like to thank lauraslady, susan3 and the rest of the bco community that have helped her (via me) the last couple of months. I know your experiences were valuable to her. We will continue to pray for all of you. Log in to post a reply",
