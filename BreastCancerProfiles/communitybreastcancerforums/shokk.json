I know many of the wonderful women here have their own stories of Nicki.........the only time Nicki and I had a \"heated\" conversation was when I suggested that she might want to stop smoking.... I only suggested it once...............Nicki set my straight about that pretty quick....but now that I am older and wiser (some may disagree) I know that her smoking had nothing to do with her breast cancer or her mets or anything else....... tonight my heart is heavy..........I know it is my own selfishness that wants Nicki to stay......I know she needs to continue her journey into freedom from cancer and pain.......she lost a beloved sister to cancer several years ago......I know they will soon be reunited....... if any of you ladies would like to stop by the circle the wagon thread and wish Nicki peace please do.....I think it was her favorite thread here at bc.org.........and our resident Chaplin Cherryl has said a beautiful prayer there for her........ thank you ladies for allowing me to walk down memory lane here.........Nicki has some wonderful friendships here in the stage 1V threads....... shokk",
