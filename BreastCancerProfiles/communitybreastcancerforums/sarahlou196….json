Cant stand waiting for results, I agree with Rangermom I have been watching lots of movies and funny comedies to lift my spirit and my mood. I also go out for a walk if the weather is good (unusually sunny here in england at the moment!). You could go for a massage or some other form of complementary medicine to help you relax, I have tried to put it too the back of my mind sometimes this does work. Remember we are all in this thing together we are here for you every step of the way. Good luck to everyone waiting for any type of result.  xx ",

I understand your panic over the lung mets I was dx with both a large primary IDC 6.5cm and 2 weeks later mutiple mets to both lungs back in March 2011 to say it was a shock was an understatement it sent me into a year long research bender which has ended up with me taking a concoction of supplements and drinking a pint of organic green veg/wheatgrass juice daily, so far so good, I've had lots of CT scans since and have been taking tamoxifen and having herceptin for the past 2 years the mets on my lungs haven't changed they have stayed the same since a CT scan in June 2011 like yours mine are also tiny and due to the no change one onc I saw told me \"it could just be scar tissue on your lungs and not cancer\" because they are so tiny they can't biopsy them so I live in a freaky kind of limbo land \"is it or isn't it\" that is the question that I have banging perpetually around in my head, I say perpetually but actually thats not strictly true as time has gone by and I remain stable and symptom free the big C constant worry is sort of somewhere around the back of my head not on my mind all the time or in my face, I get a bit nervous when I have to go in for scan results but I don't allow myself to worry until I'm in that waiting room. The only advice I can give you is to look after yourself eat healthy and try to include some gentle exercise, look into complementary treatments to help you feel better about yourself its hard to trust your body when you've lost confidence in it, live for the moment is my moto I try not to plan to far ahead and take each day as it comes, definately try and enjoy and have some laughter in your life. It certainly isn't an easy ride but its one that gets easier with each passing day. If you want too know what supplements I take or what my diet is I write a blog livingwithsbc.blogspot.co.uk/ (as a way of trying to make sense of the mountains of info on the subject) as far as supplements/diet/exercise go I think this is a personal decision and of course you don't have to change anything at all if you don't want to but for me personally by changing things it gave me a feeling of being in control of my body and life again. Take care if you want to ask anything else or just have a chat please private message me. Sending you all love and lightxxxx",

Saw my onc today and he told me that \"the lung mets have disappeared\" after 3 years of living with this knowledge that my lungs are now clear. I sat there in total shock and can't believe how lucky I am, it appears that something is working at getting rid of the bad cells. All the drugs ie: herceptin/tamoxifen, juicing, hemp oil (in the early days), the supplements and the weekly spiritual healing are all worth while, obviously I can't say exactly what it was that obliterated them but the important thing to remember is that soemthing did work. If you want to know what supplements I take or what diet changes I've made I've listed it all on my blog http://livingwithsbc.blogspot.co.uk/ (apologies but I can't seem to make a live link or copy and paste anything on this site). There was only one grey area and thats on my liver there is a mass there but they still cannot define exactly what it is it could be cancer that is stable or it could be fatty tissue, my onc is writing to the radiologist to ascertain what tests we can do to find out exactly what it is that shows up on the scans whatever it is has been static and non moving now for quite a long time and he wasn't overly worried about it although he did say we are going to keep an eye on it with 3 monthly scans. I hope this update has inspired you all that there is hope, we can beat this thing. I sincerely hope and pray you all have an outcome as good as mine.

I'm sort of coping with it within myself and then some insensitive person mentions how I look different (my best freind didn't recognise me in the street) or how my arms are now bigger than his (that was a particularly offensive comment from my brother) of course I am truly grateful to be alive BUT and its a big one, its hard adjusting not only to the after effects of the chemo/surgery/rads but too the new body image and others perception of you. Before cancer I was an size 8-10 with long brunette hair and lots of energy and a regular heating system after cancer I am a size 12-14 with short curly hair that is chronically fatigued, and extreme hot flushes I look red in the face and bloated, if I'm being honest I'm not surprised my best friend didn't recognise me I dont recognise me!! Stagefree ebru - Thank you for trying to make me feel better about it and like you I do receive some comments about how healthy I look. A bit of weight on the face does make you look healthier and iron's out some of the age lines.xxx Anacortesgirl - How come you switched to Femera? did the tamoxifen stop working? I thought we had too be on the tami for at least 5 years. Its encouraging that now after having made the switch you have managed to lose some of the weight xxxx Carpe Diem - Glad too hear your losing weight on the AI's thats very encouraging xxx Jennifer - I love the comment \"Sat here eating a spinach sandwich\" thats what I'm like I eat so healthy, I've given up red meat and sugar, I've seriously cut down on wheat and its associated products and diary (currently cutting out semi-skimmed milk and replacing with rice milk) I eat organic Salmon and freerange organic eggs but again not every week, most of the time I'm on rice cakes and salad. Can I join you in a resounding anthem of  \"The belly fat is just gross... I really do hate it\".xxxxx Heidihill- I do juice everyday a pint of organic fresh veg juice mainly green including wheatgrass, I never really thought about the calorific content of these juices before all I thought was they were ultra healthy. I follow Kris Carr and her diet approach to cancer, (google her if you havn't heard) but is an interesting point and also point taken about the fiber helps to stabilize blood glucose  levels. Well done for maintaining your size 6-8 and by the sounds of it I think I will have too increase my exercise. I do Yoga 3 times a week (which knackers me out) and I try and walk for at least l0 miles a week. I don't eat cheese, or drink any alcohol but my one pleasure is chocolate, and I don't even eat that much of it, maybe once a week. xxx I reckon it's the tamoxifen that's causing the weight gain or at the very least contributing to it, I feel rest assured that its not the herceptin which is a good thing because I will be on herceptin forever at least with tamoxifen I can see the end in sight in a couple of years time, in the meantime I will just have to persevere with the diet and exercise. Thanks again to you all. You've helped me gain a new perspective on this. Love and light to all  xxxxx",

I was also dx earlier this year back in March with both primary and secondarys to the lungs. Just got back from receiving results of ct scan which showed that the lung mets had shrunk considerably (thats what the radiologist said on his report) and that there are 3 or 4 small nodules now left on the lungs but that the rest have all but disappeared which is fantastic news, I was like you in the beginning could not sleep dreading the results which appeared to be constant bad news, now I am nearing the end of my chemo which was Taxotere/herceptin combo I am glad that I did chemo as I reckon its been working and the side effects were not so bad, you will feel better once you have started some treatment and once you know what your plan of attack is, honestly you will feel better once you have started. K-lo is right this is a very individual disease and everybody responds differently to treatments and side effects, we are all in our very own private movie. Once you have all the results you will start to relax a bit more and obviously you need time to come to terms with your dx, you always have us on the forum you will get all the support from people who know what you are going through. I also have not had any symptoms so far hopefully you wont either. Sending lots of luck and hugs to you Sarah Sweetyxxx ",

I am a bit confused about this at the results of the ct scan the nurse who delivered the results asked me if I was going to do hormonals or was I planning on having a baby in the future??? found this quite bizzare I am only 43 and ironically just before this happened to me myself and my partner had discussed having children and I was set to become an older parent then this happened and I thought that that option of having children or even one child was out of the question anybody else out there who can explain this?",

Obviously they could not be sure it was breast cancer mets cause they had not done a biopsy but now that they can see the results of the CT scan it confirms that it is mets on my lungs cause they are responding to the treatment. I also get tightness on my chest and I put that down to the herceptin, I dont have any type of cough tho so maybe get it checked out certainly mention it to the nurses and docs at the hospital.

I was dx back in March this year with primary IDC 6cm lump 3 weeks later dx with multiple mets to both lungs, straight on to chemo fec/tax 6 infusions with herceptin, then surgery mx with lymph clearance only 1 node was positive,after the chemo the lump had reduced to under 2mil also the mets on the lungs have shrunk and are currently classed as tiny and stable (love those 2 words tiny and stable) presently on tamoxifen/herceptin waiting to do rads once I can get my arm in the right position for the machine but thats another story. I am not married and do not have children, I am in a long term relationship and live in the countryside with my partner and 2 cats. This site and the english one (i am english) are a god send to me I go on in the morning and at night and check up on whats happening with everyone and also see what news there is, as we are all such good researchers, I check out any new info on supplements/diet etc. All you ladies on here are great and anyone new is always made to feel very welcome offering support and advice that you just cannot get from the hospital or your GP, the women on here are real people living and dealing with this cancer s**t also love reading the stories of hope and inspiration, there are a lot of ladies on here that have been living with stage IV dx for many years, i find that so encouraging. Tiger-blood Hello and greetings, we seem to of had a similar dx, I was interested to read that you work for Aveda dont they do really good paraben free skin creams etc? The reason I mentioned it is that recently I threw away all of my cosmetics and replaced them with paraben free cosmetics, also I feel I handled my dx ok the worst bit was telling my family and friends. Sending love and light Sarahlousie xxx ",

I had no symptoms, no change in nipple, or breast shape, no pain only an itch!!!! Thank god I scratched that itch!!!! love and light sarah xx ",
