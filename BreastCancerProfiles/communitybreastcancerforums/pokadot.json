I was told we were negative by my mother and aunt. Then I found a long lost cousin...a first cousin....my mother had two brothers that I have never met for whatever black sheep reasons back in the day....I just met a first cousin that I never knew existed. She is BRAC1 positive. And traced it all back to my grandmother....as I've stated before there are 17 women in my immediate family (my mom is the youngest of 12) that have had breast cancer. I myself am an ovarian cancer survivor (was diagnosed with it at age 31 and my doc presumed it was all genetic but I couldn't afford to get tested at the time). My oncologist suggested a prophylactic double mastectomy...before I turned 35. Well, I turned 35 this past November and it's been on my mind. Turns out this long lost cousin of mine had sent a big packet of info to my mom and my aunts, asking them to share it with their families. My mother chose not to tell me about it. As did my aunts, the information was all thrown away. I am so upset with knowing this...why would a mother not want her daughter to know of the BRCA1 in the family (especially a mother who battled breast cancer 2x, and her daughter already battling ovarian?) My mother also refused to be tested herself when my sister asked her to, prior to a hysterectomy for some problems (and after my ovarian diagnosis). I don't understand the stigma or taboo of genetic testing with these older folks. I haven't questioned my mom on this yet...I'm still trying to figure out what I'm going to say...and I know that my anger is probably all in vain as it's not likely to change anything. But now I am definately reconsidering the double mast. I have had enough chemo - I would rather save the few brain cells I have left and avoid facing it again. To many people that sounds like a drastic choice, to lop'em off and all....but I think chemo and radiation is pretty drastic too. I have an appointment in February to discuss it with my onc. I also would like to get in touch with someone who has had the surgery...hopefully more women will show up here to lend some more information...",

They gave me heparin injections 24 hr after surgery, for every 8 hrs. It didn't seem to make my drains do anything \"more\", and I healed normally so I think all is well. I thought I would have to go home with some bloodthinning medication, but I didn't. I did the heparin while there, and was told as long as I'm up and moving, clots shouldn't form, but be watchful. So let's see, I'm one week and 3 days past surgery...getting really tired of sitting around and not being able to do much ...and rely on dh to do everything like cook/clean/laundry. It gets really agrivating to me when things aren't done but I've decided I just need to let it go and not worry about it. We took a trip to Walmart yesterday so my son could spend his birthday money...but it really really wore me out, to the point of getting shaky and pale. I guess I need more healing before trying to do much of anything - it gets me a bit depressed, because the weather is finally starting to get nice, but I can't go out for much of a walk or enjoy it beyond sitting outside. I have two drains out...two to go. Hopefully tomorrow...I'm off the hard-stuff pain killers, except occasionally at night when I sleep, and just use the ibuprofen to be comfortable during the day. I find the expander to be uncomfortable, and i can't sleep unless I'm in a recliner....wonder how long that will last? Part of all this that makes me a bit down...this reminds me so much of the time when I was dx with the ovarian cancer and I was sick with chemo and surgeries...it's like one big flashback of a time that I've just about forgotten (or have tried to)....sitting around and hoping for someone to do the dishes for me...just brings it all back. I just don't like this stage of \"sit around and heal\"....I'm completely dissinterested in everything, not even books or movies, when normally I like those things. Anyways here's hoping for a speedy healing...",

I have my pre-op stuff tomorrow...and April 9 is the surgery. It's a prophylactic (preventative) surgery due to my BRCA1+ and I'm also an ovarian cancer survivor...doing my best to avoid any further chemo! Anyways, I was wondering if there is anybody out there that has issues with blood clots...and has had to deal with that as a complication to their mast surgery.....I have inherited a blood disorder that predisposes me to clots (as if BRCA1 wasn't enough in my gene pool)...I've had two clots already and the surgeons are very concerned for complications with this surgery...I will have to take bloodthinning medication right after surgery, and this will create a higher rate of post-op bleeding...might interfere with the expanders if I get blood pooling (hematoma) and such.... I'm certainly hoping for the best but preparing for the worst...maybe somebody out here has dealt with this? Another questions...I sing in a band on weekends...I have taken 4 weeks off...will that be enough? Anybody out there a singer...any thoughts or suggestions in that regard?? Other than that, I have just the same questions everyone else has...how long will it take to recover? When will I get back to work...etc....but through my lurking I have found that it really depends on the individual....but any thoughts/suggestions are greatly appreciated!! :) Bonnie  OVCA Stage IIIC Grade 3, dx at age 31....Carbo/Taxol x8 NED 2006 Log in to post a reply",

I'm the first Ovarian though. The OVCA was dx'd in 2005, and I've been with NED since 2006. My family has been tested, and we are BRCA1 and BRCA2 negative. However, I've been told that my ovarian cancer WAS genetic and linked to the breast cancer family history that I have, despite being negative. That there are probably many gene strains that have not been determined yet that could create BRCA3, BRCA4, and so on, and that I probably have one of \"those\" gene mutations. I've recently been having some breast issues...my left breast is larger than the right, it is painful, and I've had some discharge. I went to my oncologist and had a mammo and ultrasound, everything clear. My doc is pushing for a prophylactic mastectomy. I was hoping not to go so drastic, but in lieu of my recent developments I'm wondering if I should just go ahead with it. I dismissed the idea at first...thinking I wanted to get out from under the heavy cloud of ovarian cancer (worried about recurrence). But now I'm feeling I might actually have that beat, despite being diagnosed with Stage IIIC, pretty advanced. My head tells me I should do it. My feelings....I HATE surgery....and it all sounds so painful, I've been through enough pain already...",
