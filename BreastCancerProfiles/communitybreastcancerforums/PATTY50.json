Your lucky its not a more serious cancer like your cousin's husband has.  (He found out he had leukemia a week before my bc diagnosis). This was from my aunt when she was trying to \"comfort\" me about my mastectomy.  My cousin's husband and I are both survivors, but he isn't missing any body parts!",

When I found out it was cancer I was in shock but mostly upset about having to tell my mother.  I spoke to my sister first to get some advice.  I decided that I should tell my mother in person right away.  When I told her she almost fell over from the shock, but once the initial shock was over, the support she provided was more then I could of asked for.  If I could have waited until I had more information to give her, it would have been better but since she already knew about the biopsy, I had to tell her right away. Also she would have been upset with me for keeping it from her.  I think that it is best that you do tell her in person. I hope it goes well. It will be a relief for you when your family knows and can be there to support you. Patty",
