First mammo showed suspicious calcifications which were biopsied, benign. Since then I\u2019ve had areas that were followed that turned out to be nothing, more calcifications and biopsies. Then two years ago small amount dcis with atypical cells. Lumpectomy and tamoxifen. Last feb. more atypical cells. So after years of callbacks and 5 biopsies I decided to do mastectomy. Had it done July 2. Have expanders and recovering well. I could not deal with the stress anymore. I\u2019m 48.",
