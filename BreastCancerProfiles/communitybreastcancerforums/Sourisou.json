I was first diagnosed with atypia and was \"upgraded\" to full DCIS after lumpectomy. There is a great thread in the High risk forum called \"ADH club\": https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/47/topics... It will give you more general infos on the condition. I also agree with Bounce that you should find a doctor that takes the time to explain your results clearly so you can make the best decision for yourself. Why did you have a biopsy BTW? Did you have a lump or was it visible on mammo/ultrasound/MRI? My DCIS was occult everywhere except MRI.",

I'm in the same boat - DCIS, grade 2, found 2 months ago. I had a mastectomy 3 weeks ago (don't worry, I'm a peculiar case who can't have radiation so you might not need the same treatment as me) and I'm feeling very good right now. If it can help, try to concentrate on what is positive in those circumstances - so far, it's DCIS without signs of invasion, the earliest stage you could have. It's intermediate stage, there is no necrosis and it's Er+, which means you might have access to more treatments to keep it at bay. It's very good you're having an MRI as you will have the clearest picture possible and know the best treatment available to you. What also helped me a lot (and still does, since I don't have my final pathology yet) is to just let go. What is there is there, nothing can change that, but we're being taken care of, we are pro-active. And I really believe we will be okay. I'm sending you some gentle hugs and lots of love in this hard time. Let us know how things goes and join us on the DCIS board. There are tons of great, informative threads. I would suggest you read the \"Layperson's guide to DCIS\": community.breastcancer.org/for... To have more infos really helped me to calm down when I felt lost.",

This was the case for me - I had atypical cells on core biopsy and DCIS on excision. As for the MRI, I consider it en effective tool if you have access to it - it's much more sensitive than mammo/ultrasound - which is great for younger patients, or patients with dense breasts. However some doctors don't like to prescribe it systematically since it yields a high number of false positives. Hope all goes well with you and that they don't discover anything else hidden. Let us know how it goes!",
