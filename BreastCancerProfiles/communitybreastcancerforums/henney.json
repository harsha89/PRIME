This is all new to me but I do know this can happen with chemo but I need to know from anyone who made it through this without complications.  I know they may delay chemo or change dose what else can happen? She is stage 3 IDC, on ACT only had first dose of 8 cycles.. Thanks, Henney Log in to post a reply",

My sister is still in the hospital..the fever goes up and down.  The blood culture did not show anything so they are assuming that the fever is due to the neupogen. Her wbc and rbc remain low but not as low..she is having a blood transfusion tonight. Her pain has gotten so bad she is on morphine and oxycodone..they are planning to change the dose of her chemo since that dose seemed to really be too much for her. This is all such an awful learning experience..I can't even imagine going through all this physically and emotionally..I am thankful for this board as it has helped me to help my sister. I am praying for you..thank you and good night! Henney",
