The pain has decreased for me but the is still some pain in the area under my arm. Ive had 3 ultrasounds done, one of those being done on my neck since there was discomfort and everything came back fine including the mamo. I was told I had dense breast tissue and a small cyst but everything was fine. I asked for a MRI but insurance denied it based on the findings from the tests. No one can tell me why there is pain. Im also dealing with mid back pain that doctors just tell me to take advil for.... you are not being neurotic at all. Its very stressful and doesn't help when doctors give you the  brush off and its hard to concentrate on everyday life when there is an uncomfortable pain... Did you have to have a referral to see a breast specialist? I have to beg and scream just to get any testing done. :( ",
