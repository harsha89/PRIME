I'm a solo self-employed parent paying for kid college and all my own expenses, with no deep pockets/accounts to borrow from, so stopping work even for a week is not an option. My business clients are not supposed to know I'm having cancer surgery ). Anyone else managed to maintain your online work presence from home during first week after BM? If so, could you share tips? Laptop bed support, how difficult it is to type, etc. Would greatly appreciate all you can share. Log in to post a reply",
