I requested due to family history that I be referred for a Breast MRI and had one on December 1 which found the first suspicious mass, and an ultrasound on the 10th confirmed that one and saw another....",

No Leukemia but labs still all over the place. GP ordered a breast MRI and referral for BRCA test after having several bouts of cellulitis and other infections. Breast MRI December 2 showed suspicious irregular hypoechoic ovoid mass of 13mm, in left breast. Ultrasound last week confirms that and Radiologist said it was BI-RADS 4D.
