Heather - I'm so happy to hear that treatment #2 is DONE. . .woo hoo!  Praying that your SEs will be minimal, at most. Tomorrow will be treatment #2 for me, which means 3 weeks since I started.  Today, my crewcut pretty much came out completely in the shower.  Now I hope my head sensitivity/ache will subside.

Leesa - I concur with your outlook on surrounding yourself with positive thoughts.  We can do our best to fight this disease and to prevent a recurrance, but we need to live, too.  I know I will face trials and tribulations differently when this is over.  Who and what was once important at one time may no longer be.  And sometimes that includes relationships.  Some people who I \"thought\" would be there for me are completely absent.  I don't blame them. . . I blame me for having set expectations. BJMRN - my husband said the same thing to me last night. . . think about how far we've come since diagnosis.  Time goes quickly in the rearview mirror!

The topic of support groups is interesting.  I honestly consider you my support group.  I, too, am blessed with a supportive DH, family, co-workers, and all of you.  One of my work friends, who had been through this a few years ago, said it took her about 2 years before she thought she needed to talk to someone.  When she was in the \"midst of the fight\" she didn't want to talk to women who were too far on the other side.  She wanted to focus on her own journey.  A few years later, when people seemed to have forgotten, she wanted to talk to others who understood.  She is thankful to join an ACS support group and meet other survivors, as well as offer support to newly diagnosed women.  I understand her way of thinking. I start my rads on Monday (hopefully).  I have to call on Monday morning to make sure they're ready for me.  I had to go back in this past week for them to make a mesh \"shield\" type of thing.  That will change the rad plan, but they were optimistic that they would be ready by Monday.  The mesh thing helps to pull my breast down, if that makes sense.  I am so sick of hearing \"because your breast is large.\"  I'm a DD. . . have no other women my size EVER had to go through this?  Cut me a break, Doc.  Wave - your \"backward\" wig story was hysterical!  Thank you for sharing.  Your posts always bring a smile to my face.

Ckk - love the bike riding story.  In fact, it brought tears to my eyes.  Ride your bike and let the tears flow. . . and pedal away from them.  Thanks for the recommendation on the exercise book, too. Rachel - hope the pledges have rolled in.  How long is the fundraiser?  I like the suggestion of doing it on behalf of your pets.  I, too, have returned to biting my cuticles.  Ugh - habits!  I was fortunate to not have issues with my fingernails, and stayed away from the cuticles until I finished chemo and then like an old friend, I was back at them. Michelle - I hope you get some relief from the Lymphodema.  How sad that your MO didn't realize that's what it was.  Someone on here had suggested acupuncture.  I was going to try it for some of the neuropathy (I pre-purchased 2 visits), but haven't done it yet.  Maybe you should also give it a try? Lisa - You really have a bad bout of phlebitis for it to still be traveling.  Major bummer!  My two \"brown\" areas are getting lighter in appearance, but if I bump my hand, it hurts.  Heather - thanks for the recommendation on the deodorant.  I, too, am fruity smelling girl.  J  And I love supporting folks on Etsy.  Congrats on being halfway done!

I continue to be amazed at the various approaches the docs take to our treatment and survivorship.  My MO wants to do blood work when I'm done with rads and will then start me on Tamoxifen.  He said if we start Tamox and rads at the same time, there will be no way of knowing if I'm reacting to one or the other and waiting a few weeks won't make a difference.  I spoke to a girl in the waiting room the other day who started Tamox as soon as she had her surgery.  Perhaps the stage, grade, etc has something to do with it.  I don't know.  Oh. . . and we have the same MO!  He also said I would have annual mammograms (my BS wants me to have one in May for a 6-month check).  RO said that rads can give you false mammo readings, so no need to get worked up over something if you don't have to.  I'll be happy to have the mammo anyway.  My RO didn't do any blood tests.  In fact, he was bragging that \"nothing I do here involves needles.\"  Well, the tattoos did (though he didn't do them, the rad therapist did).   I just wish there was one tried and true method of treating BC without every single person, treatment, follow-up being different.  I'd like to combine a little bit of each one of our experiences and mesh it together for the perfect treatment!  Today finishes one week (5 days) of rads.  So far, so good.  I dread the soreness in the coming days/weeks, but. . .

Wave - so thankful you're okay after the machine mishap.  Yikes! Is anyone else wearing a \"mask\" to stay still during the treatment?  They made me one to cover both breasts and my left arm, pushing down a little on the right breast.   The girls say they feel bad for me, but it lines up really quickly each time.  And quite honestly, I think it's comfortable.  Strange, but I like the pressure.  So now everyday they say, \"ready for your daily hug?\"  There are 6 radiation therapists that rotate.  I'm so thankful they are cheery and friendly, since I see them every day!   I just finished week #2 (rad #10) on Friday.  I guess I have about 5 more weeks to go.  I have a new laptop coming this week.  My laptop is old and doesn't seem to connect to the WiFi very well anymore.  My DH's computer is much better, so when I can get him off of it, I snag it for a bit.  But I've been reading the page on my Nook.  :-) Wishing you all a great week!",

I am 10 weeks PFC and have a decent amount of hair regrowth.  My eyebrows/lashes just left me about 3 weeks ago (can't believe I kept them for so long and then POOF!).  Mine was coming in very grey, but is starting to get darker as the days go by.  I'm thinking about slapping some hair color on this weekend.  If my wig blows away from my face, you can see the grey hair on my sides. . . not cool.

I discussed my \"rapid heart beat\" with my onco nurse and she thinks it may be because I take a blood pressure medication.  My pressure may be dipping, so my heart is doing what it should by kicking it up a notch.  I'm going to see my primary care on Monday night (last appt so hopefully sick people will be gone), to have it re-evaluated.  Onco nurse said blood pressure often drops during chemo.  Has anyone else noticed anything with blood pressure?

I finished rads a little over a week ago and for me, the radiation was harder than the chemo (hard to believe).  I had terrible burns and ended up taking a week off from the rads.  I hope everyone has better success with the rads than I did.  I started Tamoxifen yesterday and so far (2 days in), so good.  I'm hoping my worst SEs were radiation-related, which quickly healed once the treatments were over. It's so good to see the majority of the conversations switch from dreaded chemo to HAIR!  It's definitely a positive progression for this journey we're on.  Stay cool - - it's been a hot stormy couple of days in Central Pennsylvania.",
