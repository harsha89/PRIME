I wasn't given any instructions that I couldn't wear or anything like that and was told to use aloe vera gel and we would see if I need anything stronger. I thought I would get some sort of prescription cream but she said they Start small and bring out the big gums later if needed. Oh and at the end I had a quick appointment in the CT machine she said that was to make a 3D image of me to assure everything was marked correctly. I will do 28 rads and 8 boost.
