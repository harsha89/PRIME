Dx in December - triple negative because I gotta be an overachiever :-), lumpectomy with wire loc and SNB on Jan 7th, port in on Jan 18th...now just waiting for everything to heal up. Starting chemo next month, then rads to follow once that is done. 2 weeks post lump and discovering all sorts of bruising still showing up, and I'm learning terminology I never knew about (cording! Sandpaper sensitive skin!) now applies to me. Really glad to have found this site, as it is so true...there's a lot of little details the surgeons leave out in their explanations. ",

The skin near my lumpectomy feels so sensitive everything touching it feels like sandpaper on it. The weird thing is it's about 2 inches away from the actual incision site. I read somewhere (I've read a LOT lately) that it could be from internal cauterizing where they took the margins...I have no idea if that's true, but something caused that skin to be super sensitive. Virginia123 - I used to live just down the road in Chesapeake...now I am on the other side of the country. Oh, how I miss the beach! Anyway, I am sitting at post op 16 days...I wouldn't want to be swinging a tennis racket yet, plus there is a potential of cording like I have.... Walking is definitely do-able right away, and maybe an elliptical at 3 weeks if you have a really snug sports bar and keep the arm part on the lump side easy. At least it would be low impact. SVGSurvive - thanks for the welcome. Still trying to figure out all the acronyms and the best way to find new posts versus things I've already read! ",

I still have \"stains\" left from the bruising from the dye from the sentinal node biopsy where I was injected around my areola...kind of looks like a daisy. It does not look like it will be fading any time soon. Let's see, that was January 7th, so it's been 2 months now. At least it's not still bright blue. Anybody else still have their \"dye jobs\"?",
