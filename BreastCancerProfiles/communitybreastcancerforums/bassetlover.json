Meeting with the surgeon tomrrow and I wil be sure and make ii crystal clear what I want - I read about your dog ear experience Ariom and will use that as an example. You all have been very helpful in letting me be at peace with my decision. I do have a question for Ariom - about how long was your recovery from your Uni? I normally do pretty well with pain, am very healthy - yeah,except for the cancer - and am hoping to get to my \"new\" normal relatively soon. I know everyone is different but wanted to ask.",

I still work part time but mostly from home so that is good to hear you got back to it so quickly.

Of course once I get home and look in the mirror I may have second thoughts but I don't think so. I have found this site to be extremely helpful and informative. Done nothing but read from here and other sites (Komen, American Cancer Society) for the last 3 days and it has been comforting to know there are so many sisters out there. I knew that 24 years ago but there was never a way to easily share like now. thank you all so much for sharing your journeys - it is much appreciated!",

I'm a BC survivor from 24 years ago (same breast) and had a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation so am not a candidate for Lx w/rad again so Uni Mx is scheduled for 4/2. I'm about 90% sure I don't want recon but it seems like there is a lot of pressure out there to go that route. I'm 62 years old, a size 34E and really don't want to get reduction on the \"good\" side or go thru multiple surgeries. Also live about 100 miles from my major hospital and dr so that is a consideration. I know there are a lot of happy recon ladies out there but almost from the moment I found out about the Mx my thought was \"I don't want reconstruction.\" I think the fact that I keep looking for reasons NOT to have recon means I really don't want it! I'm hoping I can find a decent fitting form / bra that will let me look \"normal\" in my clothes. Hubby is good with whatever I want to do. Just wanted to put it out there for any advice / words of wisdom...... basset lover Dx 2/21/1991, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 0/18 nodes, ER+, HER2- Chemotherapy 3/15/1991 CMF Radiation Therapy 6/5/1991 Whole-breast: Breast Dx 3/18/2015, DCIS, 1cm, Stage 0, Grade 2 Log in to post a reply",

I've had a love / hate relationship with my left breast for the last 24 years anyway so a final farewell I don't think will be too hard. Met with the BS today and she was very positive and seems on board with the straight incision and flat scar - no extra skin. Said she would do her best. She also said she wouldn't be taking any nodes so that is one less worry - besides, most of them were removed with the first BS. I'll definitely do the PT and massage. Appreciate the encouraging words!",

The drains are a major pain but that too shall pass within the week. Scar about what I expected - thanks for the advice of looking at pics - that did help. No dog ears and surgeon did a good job. Obviously will be able to tell more in a week or two after healing but overall can't complain. I think I'll be able to get the hang of this uni-boob new normal without too much trouble. I do look forward to getting fitted with a prothesis but glad to move on to that phase. Life is good - helps so much to have wonderful husband, family and friends - and the support and advice of all of you that have gone before. Bless you all -",
