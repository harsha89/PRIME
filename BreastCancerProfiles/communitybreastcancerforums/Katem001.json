The pain is always there and every few weeks flares up and is excruciating. GP just keeps giving me different pain relief and tells me 'it's probably radiotherapy after effects' Well pain flared up again 2 days ago, went back to GP this morning and say nurse practitioner. She was so helpful and took me seriously. Gave me a proper examination and checked new boob really well. The scar line is looking a bit pink and its very tender and painful. She thinks there is an infection under the boob and has given me antibiotics. Also recommended that I contact breast care nurse to be checked. I've done that and have an appointment on 14th Nov with consultant. My question is, has anyone else experienced this or anything like it? Kate x x You were born an original, don't die a copy!

When the dr told me, all I could say was 'ok Thankyou' . She explained that she will dither surgery ect but I didn't take anything in, all I thought was 'I'm going to die'. As soon as I got home I googled what I had been told and from that moment on I have been 100% positive, I AM going to be fine and I'm not going to let anything get me down, I'm 29 years old and have 3 children so I can't let anything happen to me :) In situations like this I think the only thing you can do is stay positive, although its so hard. I've cried once, When I was told the result. That's it. Since then I've been my normal happy self because I'm so convinced that I'll be absolutely fine :) The dr said the scan of my armpit looked fine so that's got my hopes up that it hasn't spread yet but she will biopsy the nodes at the time of the mastectomy, have they said anything about yours????
