The amazing women here encouraged me to keep on until I felt satisfied with the answers (or lack thereof!).  I hope you are able to do the same. Praying we both find our lumps and pain have no malignancy! Thinking of you!",

Thank you all for your wonderful wisdom and support.  I will be following and saying prayers for you all! All the best- A Log in to post a reply",
