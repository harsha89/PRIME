I will say at least with the right breast where I have the TE still, the scar has started looking alot more normal.  I think you just need to give it time.  I too was worried before, but it has faded and gotten better looking. ",

Carrol- Thanks, but I didn't dye my hair.  I was worried since I am 35 that it may come back gray, but fortunately it didn't.  I actually just took the clippers and put a 1\" blade on them and cut my hair over my ears and in the back.  I will go get it cut professionally in the next month or so. Kasey- I too use head and shoulders.  I read on Livestrong.com that the zinc in it is good for hair growth and it is also good while you are going through chemo to prevent rashes on your head. I was having trouble with my skin being dry for a while too.  I was using moisturizer like crazy and now I have this giant zit on my head.  My husband keeps laughing at it.  Not to toot my own horn, but I have always had good skin and lately, I look like my 15 year old son.  I seem to be going through puberty and menopause simultaneously.  Between the tissue expanders growing and my zits it's like being a teen again.  Now if I could get my aching body to feel the same way I'd be in heaven.",

I cannot get any sleep for lack of being able to breathe. Also, in my last post I said the oncologist said I only have mets to my lymph nodes. In the meantime, the breast cancer nurse for my hospital called and said I have cancer in the pleural space around my lung. Now, I am kind of thinking yesterday wasn't such good news after all. Does anyone have experience with what this means in terms of treatment? The lady yesterday said just to do the Lupron injections and take arimidex. The nurse today told me the hormonal treatments could take a month or two to be effective and that I should consider chemo. Any thoughts?",
