The power was off, and most of the offices were closed.  EEK! I drove 2 hours to turn around and go back home???  Well we decided to go to the PS Office and see if anyone was there.  Indeed the nurses and staff were still there, seeing the morning appts (and calling to cancel the afternoon appts).  So I did get to see the Dr after all.  My stitches and drains were removed by the nurse while my mom held a Coleman lantern and the nurse held a flashlight (I'm not kidding!!!).)  What a strange experience to have happen!",

I had the itchy thing happen again today but I haven't had a pain pill since yesterday noon.  I took some Advil but they didn't do much ... I may try some Benadryl tomorrow with my Norco to see if that helps.  I seem to have a little area w/fluid built up on the left end of my incision on my left breast... I'm watching it to see if it grows ... but will probably call the dr tomorrow just in case (my drains were pulled Mon).  I don't want it to grow larger ... and if it needs to be drained, I'd like to have that done before the weekend since my first fill is scheduled for next Thurs.   Will see how things go!  take care, ladies -- sue",

Fortunately hers didn't spread as much as it can, and we should be done with it. They are going to do a path report on the tissue, but he was 99.9% confident it was not anything to worry about.

I think I'll opt for a cute black tank top with no writing.    If anyone is in the mid-Michigan area, you're invited to the concert!!  I have an acoustic duo of brothers who will start at 7 pm, followed by Brian VanderArk, lead singer of popular Mich band \"the Verve Pipe\" who has had a hugely successful solo career these last few years.  The date is Sun June 14 - Location is 1309 N. Parkway in Midland.  Last year we had over 100 people attend a similar event for Big Bros/Bis Sis, but this year, I decided to benefit ACS and Susan G. Komen ... for obvious reasons. I'm hoping for 150 people - we'll see!!!!  Gentle hugs to all - I can't wait until my exch surgery in July.  Dani42 - if we get the same date, that would be so great!! For sure keep in touch on here so we can compare notes.  I'm just hoping they get the size right.  Now I'm probably a DD which is HUGE ... I'd like to be a full C/small D, so we'll see.  My PS keeps telling me that I am one of the lucky ones that can expect a really great result because I stretched so well .... I just hope they're right.  I've become so used to these TEs (which I never ever thought I would!) that I am used to popping out of all of my tops .. ha ha ha.  My hubby is getting used to me being huge too ... .I keep reminding him that I will be smaller after July!

My surgery was delayed a few hours due to a schedule change so I went in around 10 am and got out around 2ish to the recovery room.  Post Op is a haze -- I remember crying and having a hard time breathing due to the incredible pain.   They gave me some anti anxiety medicine & upped the pain med which finally got me to the point where I could focus a bit ... My DH has earned his angels' wings these last few days .. he has been amazing.  I never got to  my own room - they put me in an Observation Area so we were in curtained-off \"rooms\" manned by nurses in the middle.  I ended up with the most wonderful nurse that evening - she was just incredible helping me to & from the bathroom, with meds, etc.  The morphine pump ended up making me nauseous (actually vomited twice - NOT a fun experience) even with the anti-nausea meds ... They removed the IV late morning on Fri and switched me to pain pills which helped.  Plus I think it was just getting that anesthesia out of my system before I finally felt better.  The  2  hour car ride was painful - I ended up sleeping/dozing for most of it, but then the last 30 mins I was fighting nausea until we got home.  My kids are staying at my brother's house for the weekend whihc was a great idea ... peace & quiet is all I want right now.  Their welcome home poster was adorable and made me miss them all the more ... but they'll be coming back home tomorrow. My husband has become my nurse and has taken care of stripping / emptying the drains - he's doing an awesome job of everything.  We removed the dressings today and cleaned the drainage site - it wasn't as bad as I was anticipating and really I wasn't as emmotionally crushed like I thought I would be.  I have 180 ccs in each expander implant from Thursday and I'm supposed to see the PS on the 9th for  my first post op visit (unless I reach the lower levels and can get my drains removed before then).  I actually went outside for a walk on the court today with my husband to get some fresh air and sunshine .. it's freezing cold but it felt great just walking slowly.  I am about ready to lay down for another nap - he's going to build a fire for us this afternoon so it will be a relaxing afternoon/evening.  Thanks for all of the help and information on this site - it's been wonderful to read your experiences & advice - that helped me tremendously!!! Best wishes to everyone else in their various stages of recovery.....sue",

Question - you were filled with 350cc??? WOW!!!  I only got 180 CC so I'm tiny compared to what I used to be - a 38D.  I'm pretty flat with pouchy hanging sacks waiting to be filled.  :)  I see the PS on Monday so we'll see  when that process starts.  Hang in there !!  I hope to hear from the drs with my path report tomorrow ... hope we don't get a surprise.  take care, sue",

I am going to trust they know what they're doing.  I've got 3 more fills to go (I'm at 500 ccs right now and I am maybe a B cup) and then we meet with the PS for his final review and implant selection.  sue",

I had an enlarged thyroid for quite a while - had some testing done to see if it was considered \"hypo\" but it wasn't ... then about 10 yrs later during a yearly exam, the dr (not my normal doc, but a different one) was feeling my lymph nodes and noticed the thyroid ... she felt it needed to be looked at again.  so I had some ultrasounds taken and a needle biopsy.  It was not cancer, but they felt it needed to be removed since it had changed.  So I had half of my thyroid removed two years ago ... I now take synthroid every day.  No problems with it whatsoever ... so hang in there!  Just because it's enlarged doesn't mean cancer .... it could just be a \"funky\" thyroid like mine!  :)  Good luck!!! sue",
