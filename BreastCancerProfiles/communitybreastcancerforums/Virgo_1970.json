I am 48, diagnosed clinical stage 2b, and completed 4 rounds of TAC - with very bad allergic reactions to Taxotere... so before my 5th treatment, the dr recommended only A/C for the last 2 treatments. Anyway, some of my side effects don't seem to be quite the norm - no nausea or vomiting, instead I have had phlebitis in left arm since 3rd treatment - still all bruised and painful (advil helps, but I can't live on it, plus I worry about the liver with all these drugs). My right arm reacted similarly to the A/C on the 5th treatment, but the phlebitis didn't get as bad as the other arm, so it's healing a bit faster but still tender and bruised. Now I have a clogged ear with terrible tinnitis as well! My numb palm seems manageable, but RBC is getting lower - worried about needing transfusion for the 6th treatment. On the plus side, the MRI this week isn't showing any cancer in lymph nodes or breast anymore, so I feel like the chemo is doing more harm than good at this point - but I am frightened to quit with 1 more to go (the \"what ifs\"). I still have surgery and radiation. I have no Oncotype score, but I have no genetic predisposition. Thoughts??

Thank you for your thoughtful suggestions. No, I do not have a port or PICC line.. so i am not sure how tomorrow will go with the A/C though. best wishes to you as well. Beauz, sorry about your pathology report... hope you're managing well on the Xeloda... I've heard the same - that a lot of women don't finish their full course.. the chemo is no cake walk, so unfortunately, it's not surprising....glad their MO's advised that it was safe to do so. thank you for the reassurance. All the best to you as well.",
