I had my masectomy yesterday with immediate implant (nipple and tissue sparring). I could not have asked for a better team of doctors and nurses. I stayed one night and while I didn't sleep much I was well taken care of. I was nauseous from the anesthesia and had 4 meds for that in recovery. They really dont want you throwing up. They said the numbed my breast really well and I've only been taken tylenol and a muscle relaxant. Great if it stays that way but I have meds if needed. I feel more tightness than pain. Once the nurse pinned my two drains to my bra I was comfortable. I had two sentinel nodes removed that were clear, yay! Was so worried since this was a recurrence in 4 places 4 years out from original dx. Good luck everyone! Speedy recoveries!",

It's far off as my husband and I had plans to visit Nashville 9/12-17. I've met with the PS. Taking Letrozole and dealing with the stress. Of waiting and worrying about the surgery. WigLButtz I hope everything turned out well for you. I totally understand the emotional toll this surgery places on you. I'm hoping I can get my head together beforehand but probably wont.",

My MX surgery is next Wed, the 26th. When I had my lumpectomy I took a clanosopam (sp) and kept telling myself I was ridding myself of this tumor and had the best doctor's helping me. Deep breathing helps too. Let us know how things go.",
