Appreciated the description in another blog describing the \"burned\" area as \"weeping\" magenta red and very very sore.  Am very fair skin - and sunburn easily.  Started Miaderm two days before treatment.  Skin turned pink and bumpy by day 3.  Upped the Miaderm from 2X a day to 3X a day.  RO recommended lots of air to the skin.  Able to work from home so have spent 6 weeks with fans blowing constantly on skin.  Did well until treatment #21.  By then band across chest very red and itching.  1% hydrocortisone cream helped.  Underarm very red and painful.  9 days after treatment #25, areas of skin still sloughing off, under it is \"weeping\" magenta red and very tender. RO gave Carrasyn burn cream - but it, like Miaderm, really burns.  Aquaphor has helped relieve the tightness.  Having so much \"gooey\" drainage may call dr tomorrow to see if that's \"normal\".  May go looking for hydrogel pads too!  Thanks all for sharing. Saw Dermarad mentioned online - product out of OK.  If the pictures and testimonials are accurate I would encourage any fairskinned person to use that and not Miaderm.  Miaderm certainly didn't help \"prevent\" redness, severe \"burning\" or radiation  dermatitis for me.  But since I knew I could get a bad \"burn\" I was hesitant to use anything but the product the RO recommended...  really wish I'd had the courage to try Dermarad!
