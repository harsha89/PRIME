I had my MX on Dec. 15th, so I am so ready to move on to the real surgery.",

Hurts sometimes also. I don't massage alot, but I do after every shower and use oils or lotions on it. The scar seems thick and it is getting tight, is that normal? I suppose I should be massaging it more, but always forget.",

      "Content": "horsegal13 wrote: After my reconstruction and breast lift surgery, I got a infection around my nipple on the lifted side. Called my plastic surgeon, didn't hear from him. I went to my local doctor, he gave me some antiobiotic cream as I'm allergic to many penicillins and antibiotics. It got better. Then I still noticed a 'pocket' by one of the 4 main holes from the stitches. I had surgery on Aug. 27th, and it's now mid November. I got 3 pieces of 'stitches' out of my nipple. It looks like thick fishing string. When I had my 6 week checkup, I told PS about my infection and he said he used a new type of suture that he is not happy with. He said allergic reactions were more common with it. I keep using my cream when I noticed red in the area I got the 3 pieces of stitches out of. Now all looks good. My local doctor said it was good I came in, he said I can't take the chance of any infections as I have a implant, a rod and screws in my back also from back surgeries. I am not happy with my 'healing', hubby told me I should call my PS and let them know. I don't have to go back until April for my nipple procedure. You can bet I won't let him use that new type of suture, that's for sure! Life is good....... Dx 11/30/2010, DCIS, Stage 0 Log in to post a reply",
