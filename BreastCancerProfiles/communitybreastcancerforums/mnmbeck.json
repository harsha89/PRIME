I smiled when I read your post...saying it was your last day with your body. I did the same thing. I looked in the mirror, wondered if I would remember, years from now, what I looked like. I reminisced....remembering feeding my babies, etc. I taught breastfeeding classes for a few years (I am an RN). I found it bizarre that I would end up with breast cancer. Then, I started reading and realizing that I wouldn't be able to use my arms for awhile. I love working out with kettlebells, and my PS told me I might not be able to do that again.....maybe ever. SO, I did my kettlebells, and sit-ups, and crawled around on the floor and tried to soak it all in and wondered if I would ever feel normal again after my surgery. And, here I am 3 weeks after the surgery still wondering if I will feel the same ever again....but grateful I had that short time to appreciate what I could do. It's strange how we cope with our losses.",

She told me that there is a big temption to overdo it in the beginning.  Unfortunately, we don't know what it MEANS to 'overdo' it!  She said we will be trying to raise my threshold without passing it, and this can be a challenge.  But, we will err on the side of caution for now.  Does this seem consistent with what everybody else is doing....or at least how they started? So....my understanding of starting to exercise again after LE diagnosis is.....take it slow....slower than you think you should.  And, a workout isn't going to necessarily feel like a workout for awhile!!!  I am just dying to hop on an elliptical machine, suck air, and SWEAT!  My body is weak, flabby and fatter than it was before this all began.  Ugh!",

My hair wasn't even dry before I delivered. I really thought I'd get through this the same way. NOT! Immediately after surgery, the nurse asked me if I was having pain. I told her I was having severe chest pain. I was positive I was having a heart attack. Until reading these posts recently, I still was wondering if I might have had a cardiac issue. Like you said, that \"must\" be what a heart attack feels like! It's nice to compare notes with others and see that we have so much in common. Even though nobody wants to be in this \"club\", it's nice to have this great support! I have a friend who had a BMX 3 years ago and is now going through reconstruction. She is almost done being 'filled' and her main complaint \"these things are rock hard...and it feels like I am having a heart attack.\" So...we are not alone!",

(sometimes .5cm).  I have not been wrapped.  My LE is so mild and I have been having skin reactions to anything that is put on my skin (including compression garments), which is of course NOT good for LE.  So, she is not planning to try that anytime soon.  These skin reactions are really complicating things!! The last couple of times, we have tried light exercise.  The first time I did it, I will admit, there was a decrease....up to a cm in some places.  I was willing to admit that could be a difference.  We did it again today without a noticeable difference, but the plan is that I am going to move forward with some consistency....very light exercise.  Soooo.....we'll see! And, to answer your question....my surgery was Oct. 24.  My initial 'flare' was on mid Dec.  Thankfully, I was already having PT, and since my PT is also a CLT, she did measurements on my arm before she addressed the issues I was there for.  So, she had baseline measurements, which I am so thankful for!  After that initial increase in swelling, it has pretty much remained the same, which very, very little fluctuation, no matter what I do. ",
