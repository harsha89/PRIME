I counted 30 seconds during the treatment.  Am so looking forward when this is done.....7 weeks all day long......my skin is red but fine, no blisters...I am happy with that....no problems under the armpit. And for my stomach, the doc. gave me some Nexium and Xanax. Hmm, it is getting better. Maybe I am still angry at the whole thing. I have to get over it. After finishing radiation I will take a break for 4 weeks and then try the Tamox again. And if it will not work, I have to think about other possibilities. I am always doing some research on the internet about using the Tamox and about the dosis. Maybe some minimal low dosis is also working like 5 mg or 10 mg daily, but with less SE. Wish you all ladies a nice weekend and take good care of you skin..",

My skin is red but good , only under the adhesive tape which covered the markers, the skin is a little bit broken, but manageable. I cannot tell you , how happy I was, when I left the office..btw I got a graduation certificate. How nice. For my nausea they gave me some Nexium and Xanax, just low dosis. But it helps me. I tried running, but that was a bad idea....after 10 min. I was so groggy..omg....I totaly underestimated the radiation therapie. I think I will need some time to recover. But my dry cough is gone. But it is not over: I will see my gyn at the end of october, talking about the oophorectomie, to make me postmenopaused. I still do not know what to do..... Nancy.
