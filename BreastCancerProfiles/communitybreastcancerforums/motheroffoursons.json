    "Content": "motheroffoursons wrote: About ten years ago, started having abnormal pap smears.  Had two coposcopies(I think this is a biopsy of the cervix, and a LEEP - an electrical loop is placed around the cervix and the outer cells are \"fried\").  Must be invented by a man.   Finally cleared up.  Home Free. Two years ago, BC.  However I had only a lumpectomy that turned out to be DCIS, followed by radiation and tamoxifen.  Home free. One year ago had the red boob explosion that matched pictures of inflammatory breast cancer.  Two MRIs, mammograms, and a punch biopsy over 3 months, showed nothing.  Attributed to radiation reaction.  Home free. MRIs last year showed multiple lesions on my liver and pancreas.  Come back in six months.  After six months the lesions were the same.  Home free. Now I have two masses on my ovaries (one 4 inches across, one 2 inches across) that might be related to tamoxifen.  Initial diagnosis of larger mass is a benign dermoid cyst, but it has been growing-- which is unusual in post menopausal women.  The second could be a cystadenofibroma  or borderline tumor (tumor of low malignant potential), but they will not know until they dig around in there.  I see the gyn/onc on Friday and will probably schedule a hysterectomy to be done within the next couple of weeks.  Who knows what else they will take out. My fear is that the masses on my ovaries and in my pancreas and liver are really breast cancer mets from unconfirmed inflammatory.  Possibly the growth of the masses have been kept in check by Tamoxifen since my original tumor was 100% hormonal. My rhetorical question is, How many home frees do you get in a lifetime?  My Dad died with stomach cancer, and my mom had early stage colon cancer.   I am getting afraid that I have used up my \"Home frees\". I have that feeling that it is more serious than any of the others I have faced.  I am afraid of not getting another \"home free\".  I am more nervous now than I have been since the start of my bc saga. God does not promise you tomorrow, he promises eternity. Sharon Dx 11/2/2006, DCIS, Left, 4cm, Stage 0, Grade 2, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
