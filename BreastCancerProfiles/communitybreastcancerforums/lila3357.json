Scheduled for BMX with reconstruction and sentinel node biopsy on April 3. This is my second time in the same situation. Last time, had lumpectomy and radiation. Both times high grade DCIS, Multiple biopsies with ADH, LCIS, etc in between. Struggled with my decision...but here I am... and feeling quite anxious. Starting to make a plan and learning a lot from all of you!! Thankful to have a place to \"listen\" and learn.  ",
