So lots of history.   About 3 months ago very high up on my breast, lower than collar bone but higher than areola, I saw a red spot and thought \"hmm spider bite\"  a week later still there but bigger so I think \"hmm rash from sweating\" because I am a long distance runner.    Well then two weeks after that I got that nasty cough flu floating around and doc put me on Zithromax and I figured that would clear up the spot.   It did not and it continued to grow into this circular form.  So then I thought, ringworm?  BUT no itching, or flaking.   Fast foward to about 3 weeks ago I went to the General Doc and he was stumped because it is not itchy, flaky it's just like a branding almost, raised red circular, so he did mammogram ultrasound and nothing and the radiologist said \"I highly doubt this is IBC\", so then I was sent to a dermotologist two weeks ago and he did punch biopsy and I swear that this waiting is AWFUL!!!   They said one week, then they said a couple days more and then they said today and come 4 p.m. when I called they said \"Still don't have results\"  and I am going insane.  Now tonight, after staring at my breasts in the mirror for the thousandth time, I am THINKING, that I am noticing that my breast with the circular red brand like rash/mark  has increased in size and is all of a sudden sagging, drooping more and the areola has drooped a lot, OR AM I GOING CRAZY and this was there all the time but I have never stared at my own breasts so much that I never noticed it.     And now I have to get through yet another weekend and I am going insane.   ANYBODY at all have these kind of marks, symptoms.   Again, no hotness, no itching but this odd marking and size difference.     Whatever information at this point from anyone would be a welcome, calming voice, thanks so much.   Log in to post a reply",

Thank you thank you thank you, you truly helped me so much and I will rest easy for the rest of this weekend.   So grateful. Alison",
