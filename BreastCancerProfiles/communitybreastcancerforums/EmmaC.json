So strangely enough I take biotin and a prenatal vitamin. This weekend at work a few coworkers noticed my new hair under my head buff. One even said they were going to tear up. When I ws at pool two preteens were making fun of my baldness, the mom was mortified. I pretended not hear them but I did cry. And every once in awhile I see very young children stare at me and rub/pet their heads which I think is cute. I usually make jokes out of it, My nephew was born when I was diagnosed and I have a race over who gets hair first. I have a picture of his head and the caption says \"He is winning by a hair!\"",

I cut off the chemo curl because you could see where it changed from chemo curl to more normal hair, it isn't like it was though. I thought I could deal with a short hairdo but it just makes me aggravated.  I wear small hoops that my husband has given me over the years. I have 4 in each ear. I see the stylist in a week. Maybe she will have an idea. She is a very kind woman who understood my anxiety when I came in before. And thank you for the responses! You gals helped!",
