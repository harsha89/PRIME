I was referred to my breast surgeon and we talked about treatment options.  We decided to go with chemo first (neoadjuvant) to see if we could shrink the tumor so I could have a lumpectomy (i never wanted a lumpectomy but that's what happens when you are 29 and your parents are still trying to parent you!).   So I was assigned a medical oncologist who suggested we do six rounds of taxotere/cytoxan chemo.  After the third round we couldn't feel it anymore so I talked him into only doing four rounds of chemo before surgery.  Had a bilateral mastectomy on February 11 in which they removed all the breast tissue and my nipples leaving only the skin intact with tissue expanders underneath so I can get implants later.  They found NO CANCER in the tissue that was removed so I had a pathological complete response (pCr). According to my doctor my chance of recurrence is way below 10%.  Therefore, I am happy to report that I am no where near terminal and at worst I have just been highly inconvenienced for the next year or so.   Cancer is not a death sentence for everyone.  For a lot of us, IT'S JUST ANNOYING!  :)   As to your doctor, if he/she does not make you feel safe, then find another one.  This is your journey and you need to do what's right for you.  Don't worry about hurting people's feelings, you're the patient. ",
