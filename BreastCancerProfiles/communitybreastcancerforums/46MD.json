I wonder if Taxol will turn them black? In the beginning, I would feel instantly better after about 5 days, but now the cummulative effect makes the 'instant' not so instant anymore.",

And last night was just horrrrrrible for me with my bowels (day 3 after treatment, day after neulesta shot) Its just ridiculous what this all does to my body for about 3 days. Today I'm much better, but not the night to have to stress whether a tree will fall into your house! I don't normally feel anything when the drugs go in. Sleepy at some point. Losing hair like crazy!! Scarf time is coming sooner than I thought.  Was afraid I was getting mouth sores the other day, but I seemed to fight it off with biotene, and its subsided. I get angry they don't push more 'good stuff' you could do for yourself. Or is it just my Onc?? Why aren't we told more about stomach enzymes, or what vitamins/supplements might help us feel more energetic? I'll stop venting. Feeling better today. But its a brutal few days so far.",

I guess I'll be more up on the lingo when I get more info from my chemo doc. I have a 2nd meeting w/him Aug 1st, meeting w/port consult Aug 4th. Sounds crazy, but hopefully I don't have to wait too long. For as angry/apprehensive I am about having to go thru chemo, If I'm gonna do it, I want to get it started. The sooner I start, the sooner I will be done! Yes, I also have the cold sensation when I drink cold fluids. Verrrry strange. And it makes you think/realize, literally whatever you drink flows thru you. For you teachers out there, wow....you are going to have to be careful in your work environment. According to my Dr. literature about immune system vulnerability, you will be in a prime environment for getting sick. Be careful!! Lets hope we all are 'exceptions to the rule' as far as getting sick. I enjoy all of your comments, keep them coming :)",

I don't usually have allergic reactions to things, but I'm a little fearful with this stuff. No matter what we are all going thru, we are getting closer to the end. Just keep thinking that.
