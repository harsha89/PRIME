My incision has healed well, and the drained lymph fluid shows no sign of infection. So I 'm  trying to be patient.  I think it's improving, and  I'm trying not to have a panic attack every time I look at it.  I think we all expected that 'six week\" recovery period to be the end of healing issues, but I understand seromas and hematomas are very common side effects of mastectomy surgery.  I get in the pool everyday and do some light exercises with a pool noodle and for several hours after that, things are much better.",

Hope this helps.  I'm sure others who have had ports longer have some additional thoughts.",

On a related note, I watched the grocery store \"fish man\" stop scrubbing a sink full of discarded fish parts with his bare hands to come over to help me.  He didn't wash his hands, just put on a pair of gloves and smoothed each on with his bare hands as he put them on.  When I said \"you didn't wash your hands\", he said he didn't need to because he put on gloves.  I pointed out he had just rubbed his contaminated hands on the outside of the gloves, and he just looked at me like I was crazy.  Since the WBC drop, maybe I am.  Since I planned to cook the fish, it wasn't that big a deal, but it made me take the \"raw\" food part  a little more seriously.   It's easy to assume food in the deli, etc is safe when you really don't know what happened you didn't see. ",

As for husbands, our only disagreement so far has been over the schedule, which also sounds like a common theme.  Once we got past him being upset with me for saying he was \"oblivious\" [which he heard as \"not supportive\"], we finally agreed that the schedule has to be better coordinated.  It's been a crazy six weeks since my diagnosis and he's as tired of doctors and hospitals as I am.  But we've got a long way to go.  So we sat down with calendars and marked out everything.  I told him when I think I will need his support and he agreed not to schedule something without talking to me first, or to reschedule when possible.   Some things are beyond his control but he now understands that him being flexible is key to my emotional well-being.  Since flexibility is one of his \"needs improvement\" areas, he's working hard on it and I appreciate it.   I'm working hard on speaking up when I need something rather than just smoldering over his failure to figure it out.  We'll be doing the calendar update every week. Fortunately, we are both self-employed so have some ability to control the schedule.  I hope everyone is having a decent day, or see one coming soon!",

I am probably everyone's worse nightmare when it comes to BC.  Left IDC, < 1cm with negative nodes 13 years ago, treated with lumpectomy, radiation and tamoxifen.  Extensive DCIS in same area 4 years ago - mastectomy and \"cured\".   But a strange \"thick\" spot appeared on my right breast in Feb - mammo and ultrasound negative, but MRI birads 5. It was  invasive lobular carcinoma covering a 5 cm area with 2 positive nodes. ILC doesn't form a lump...it just spreads out like water.  That's while I was 6 month follow- along!  However, I plan to be around a lot longer and I'm now officially out of breasts, so I figure this time, I'm going to kick this thing once and for all.  I've opted for no reconstruction...I really don't want to put myself through more surgery once chemo is over.  If I were younger I might feel differently, but right now, I'm  perfectly happy with those \"killer boobs\" gone.   Of course, the hair is almost gone, too.   So many of you are inspirations - with your jobs and families to tend to, you just keep going despite the hard smacks from chemo!  So I figure my worst day is still easier than what many of you are facing.   Hang in there!",

My eye doctor said I have chapped eyeballs from not blinking enough ( there is an official medical name for it, but he said that's pretty much what was going on). I don't know if I'm blinking correctly yet, but he prescribed drops to keep my eyes moist, and a medication for my eyelids, so they aren't hurting any more. Just keep your doctor posted on your symptoms - if they don't improve between sessions, then they get a little worried. .",

As for \"survivor\" I have trouble defining myself by my breast cancer.  I've survived lots of things so far - bad parenting, car accidents, painful relationships, etc.  BC is just one of many on the list...so I guess I'm a \"life survivor\".",

Or having lost a breast, why you would not choose reconstruction. My surgeon asks me every visit if I've changed my mind about reconstruction and I tell him \"no\" every time. So you have a number of options and you should go with the one that feels right for you. Hindsight being 20/20, I wish I had done a BMX much earlier, because I developed a new BC on the \"good\" breast.

Obviously, there's no bone there for cancer to settle in. I think Taxol does a number on existing joint or muscle issues, so we all just need to give it some time. I'm reminding myself to stand up and stretch every 20 minutes, and to stretch before getting out of bed and that makes a lot of difference.

Right now, her doctor is appealing that decision based on family history. 2. My understanding is that once breast tissue is removed through a bmx there will never be normal breast sensation. I'm still pretty numb, but hoping for more normal skin sensation over time. I can have reconstruction if I want, but can't imagine that will ever happen. 3. I have microbead foobs - lightweight, waterproof, relatively inexpensive. Aside from the desire to \"squish\" them like any microbead-filled object, I think they are great. Of course, don't flush them down your toilet as they are not biodegradable. 4. I get tightness under my right arm and across my incision, and see a lymphatic massage therapist to help manage it. My doctor says \"that happens\". Okay. 5. Cancerversary - When I found it? When it was officially diagnosed? When it was removed? When I finished chemo? Beats me. I think the doctor is counting from official diagnosis which is March 1. So I'm at 9.75 months, but don't have any plans to celebrate any of the above events. 6. Christmas decorations - this one is a real stumper. normally I collect items for the tree that reflect the year's experiences, but I'm pretty sure I don't want any cancer ornaments on the tree.

My air conditioner was off for 24 hours this last week due to the routine maintenance person cutting a wire while checking to make sure everything was OK.

She talked to the financial aid office and they got her into a program that helped pay her costs. Lynn, when do you stop adding the \"if I'm here\" mental statement. I don't know exactly when but you do stop. I'm doing it again on occasion, and it does annoy me. But my approach is to take it one day at a time - when I get up in the morning, I know life is uncertain and lots of things could kill me...the garbage truck may run over me, I may slip on the wet lawn and break my neck, I could choke on a chicken nugget, etc, etc but I don't spend any time worrying about things I don't know about. Since I know for sure I won't die of breast cancer tomorrow [or Saturday or Sunday.], I give myself permission to not worry about that either. Just save it for another day when there might be something I should worry about . I call it the \"Scarlett O'Hara\" approach, which is really not as frivolous as it sounds; giving yourself permission not to worry is quite a powerful affirmation. Should have had rad 18 today but a thunderstorm knocked out power and they sent everyone home. Fortunately not getting radiation at the time, which would have been freaky. Of course, it would have been a good addition to my cancer adventure novel, or my breast cancer board game (still to be invented). So I'm on #17 and no one has mentioned cornstarch.

MY MO also likes a month after rads to start AIs for the same reason, although that does make me a little uncomfortable - since AI is the best insurance for postmenopausal ER+ ladies. Seems like two- three months is a long time between chemo and AI. I'll shop for the brow powder - or maybe I'll stop by UPS and ask the lady to pray for the return of my hair, brows and eyelashes.

If blood work holds up tomorrow, it will be a positive end to the A/C experience.  Hard to explain but I'll definitely take it! I see the doctor tomorrow to decide on Taxol treatment  - right now, I'm going to ask for dose dense (his recommendation) just to get it over.  I'm feeling reassured by the experiences you dose dense ladies are reporting, so I want to give it a try.  But I'm asking for an extra week between A/C and Taxol to have a little quality time with my family - seems like every minute since Mar 1has been consumed with some aspect of breast cancer, and/or recovery from some treatment.   A \"normal week\" sounds like heaven and hopefully will give me the psychological boost I need to get through Taxol. Here's hoping that for those of us with A/C behind us, the worst is over.   Thanks for the Taxol feedback - it helps to hear real life experiences.   ",

Since DCIS in a breast where invasive cancer has already occurred increases your risk for another invasive cancer, and since no additional radiation can be given after a lumpectomy with radiation, a mastectomy is usually recommended.  But no additional treatment, and no real impact on prognosis. I guess you could call it preventative surgery, since there is no way of knowing if DCIS will morph into invasive cancer. I just wish I had done a BMX then,,,but no one really thought that was necessary. This last one was 'sneaky\" ILC, mixed with LCIS..  The LCIS probably had been there for quite a long time, identified as breast density, and something encouraged the invasive component to develop.  But ILC doesn't form a lump and never showed up on mammograms and ultrasounds.  In Feb, I insisted something was seriously wrong - radiologist agreed an 8mm area \"might\" be suspicious.  MRI showed 5cm area and that turned out to be right, along with 2 positive nodes. So - long answer to short question.  My prognosis is better because this is not a recurrence.   I think I'm the only ILC lady in this group - a distinction I could have lived without.  Not that you aren't all a wonderful group!  ",

The consulting oncologist freaked out about my neuropathy and asked another oncologist to join her for extended discussion whether to do full infusion, half infusion or no infusion. They settled on half-infusion, monitor symptoms when I come in for blood counts and then let my regular oncologist decide what to recommend next (I think that's called CYA). So I won't see my doctor until Aug 3 and won't have another infusion until we meet - just 4 days later than the regular schedule. On a good note, I got a hand and foot massage during infusion and instruction on ways to reduce pain with massage. I'm not upset by this delay. My father is wheel-chair bound due to peripheral neuropathy and has been an invalid for years as a result. I said at infusion 1, I would not accept permanent disability as an outcome for Taxol treatment, as it adds too little to my overall survival for such a negative outcome, and my oncologist agreed my treatment would be guided by my neuropathy symptoms. I will be 65 in August, and for me, quality of life is just as important as quantity of life. Maybe more important. Doctors always recommend the standard of treatment they believe works best, which likely does works for many people. But not everything works for everyone, and not every doctor agrees on what's best. And sometimes we don't share symptoms because we think it sounds like complaining, and that we're not being good BC warriors. For anyone who believes their treatment may be hurting more than helping or you have an SE that really worries you, you should definitely speak up. That's not complaining - that's being proactive about your health. End of the sermon for today from one of this group's senior participants. Hope everyone has minor SEs and major good days!

Watery eyes can be a dry eye symptom and dry eyes are just one of the many chemo side effects doctors forget to mention, made worse by loss of protection once provided by those missing eyelashes. My opthomalogist went off for a while about the relationship between chemotherapy (especially Taxol) and dry eye, glaucoma and inflamed eyelids. He was distressed that oncologists seldom suggest an opthomalogic follow up and if problems go on long enough it can scar your corneas. I went because my eyes hurt so bad and I felt like my vision was fuzzy. Cells shedding and blocking my ducts were causing dry eye and inflamed eyelids...he said my eyeballs were basically chapped. My oncologist raised his eyebrows in polite disbelief when I told him about the eye problems.",

It's been a while since I checked in, but just in from my one year anniversary, and assuming my metabolic panel comes back normal, everything else looks good. However, my oncologist asked me to consider participating in a one-year Aromasin/Affinitor clinical trial to see if the combo prevents or significantly delays a recurrence in lymph-node positive women better than Aromasin alone. Given that I'm finally feeling like a normal person, I'm pretty sure the answer is no, but I did say I would think about it.. I wondered if anyone else is participating or considering it.",

After the ordeal of surgery, chemo and radiation, the idea of more surgery seems overwhelming. Talking with friends who had reconstruction and developed signficant issues also contributed to my decision. However, my surgeon says you don't lose the option, so if you change your mind, that's fine. She also said that reconstruction is not an especially easy process, so she would rather a woman wait until she's sure she wants reconstruction then to do it because society expects you to. Personally, I'm fine with no breasts. In many ways, it's more comfortable, especially if you had large breasts. I never wear a bra around the house, and often do not wear prostheses when leaving home. But everyone has to decide where their comfort level is, and that's a really personal decision. I am going to try shower scrunchies in my bathing suit...if they float out...so be it. As for the gym dressing room, I was never particularly comfortable stripping down in front of strangers when I had a good body and two perfectly fine breasts, so I guess that's nothing new for me. Breast cancer is an unfortunate reality in many women's life, and I'm always surprised how many women reveal their situations once they know mine. We're a bigger sisterhood than we know.",

Like SpecialK, I was off the strong meds even before I left the hospital...just Tylenol.  You are SORE...but there is a difference between being sore and having pain that won't stop. I still have soreness where the drains were...actually more than the incision itself.  The drains are annoying, and you'll feel a lot better when they are out.  They will probably limit you to 10 pounds for a while, so no picking up  babies!.  I bought a camisole with a space for some fiberfill.  By week 2, I just put in a little fluff, and my husband and I went to the movies.  I put some meals in the freezer, and my husband just popped them in the microwave.  If you have friends or family who offer to do things, like grocery shop or help with laundry, LET THEM HELP!  They'll feel good they did and you will appreciate it.. Mostly, I have numbness and some slight swelling at my underarm , but otherwise, I think things are going well for less than 3 weeks.   This is a recurrence for me, so the emotional part of it was the worst, and that all took place before the surgery.  ",
