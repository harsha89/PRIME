The waiting is just making me bonkers. Elaine, I think that I will call the breast surgeon on Monday and ask to get the appointment scheduled. I called her office last week to see if the referral had come in, and although it hadn't, the woman that I spoke to was exceptionally kind and wanted to be helpful. This is the first (assumed) fibroadenoma that I've ever wanted fully removed, not just biopsied. I'm interested to hear the surgeon's thoughts about that. Thanks again! This helped so much. This is an exceptional site full of amazing women.",

I've also been sending my warmest wishes to those going through truly hard times right now. My mom had BC in her early 40s, but I tested negative on the BRCA testing. My ob/gyn strongly advised me to do the genetic testing a couple of years ago, and my parents have had cancer several times each. I have had annual mammograms since I was 35, and had my first biopsy while pregnant at age 25. It came back as a fibroadenoma. I've developed several of them over the years, but all have been fine. In the past few months I developed a lump very quickly that does not feel quite the same to me. It doesn't change in size with my cycles, and is just different than what I am used to. I already had a screening mammogram appointment set up when I found the lump, so I went to that rather than first getting a doctor's appointment. The tech was a bit bummed to do a screening mammogram on someone with an obvious lump, but did a good job getting a few extra photos. The call back said ultrasound, straight to a breast surgeon for a risk assessment, and MRI recommended. My breast density is described as \"extremely dense\" and it is noted that mammograms are not appropriate for me. It's taking forEVER to get in for the follow up appointments. My ultrasound is not until this Wednesday, which is two weeks after the mammogram, and I'm still waiting to be scheduled with the breast surgeon. The wait is making me feel physically ill. Usually I'm pretty good about brushing these things to the side and getting distracted with other things in life, but I'm failing miserably this time. I feel tearful and scared and just sort of a tender wreck. Really I just wanted to write this all out to get it out of my system. I know that folks are dealing with far more than this, and I feel like a fool for getting so wound up without any real information. But I'd love a pat on the back and maybe a kick in the rear to get moving in life. Thanks for listening this far. xoxo Log in to post a reply",

The visit to the surgeon had good news and meh news. The good news is that the lump that I was feeling was actually a giant cyst, which he dealt with in office. He sent it off to the lab, and I got the call on Friday that it was a benign cyst, just as the doctor expected. The meh news is that while there, he found another area that he did not like, so I still need to have an MRI. I was hoping to be able to put this to rest completely that day, but I am happy to err on the side of caution and get an MRI. I'll let you guys know how it goes. Thanks again for the love and support. I can't explain how this lump/experience has been more nerve-wrecking than ones in the past, but it definitely has been.",
