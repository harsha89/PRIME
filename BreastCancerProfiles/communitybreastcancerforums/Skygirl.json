      "Content": "May 6, 2011 07:55PM - edited May 6, 2011 07:59PM by Skygirl Back on the boards after a few days off. As helpful as reading is, it is also somewhat overwhelming. So am taking things a bit at a time. Cyborg, glad to hear from you. You are the forerunner here, so I have kept you in my thoughts this week especially. It has been really helpful to hear about all the healthy eating going on here. Usually I grow a large all organic, heirloom garden, but didn't get a chance to plant this year. Bad timing. So Farmer's Market will be a good place soon. I am a Northwesterner misplaced in the South. There are Mennonites here who grow good stuff. May not all be organic, but as close as you can get. Someone mentioned the hormones/additives given cows now and a link to cancer. Am thinking the same. I love dairy. But think that as good as I have been about keeping healthy, there seems to be no way to avoid additives/chemicals in the environment and in the grccery. Only way is to reduce exposure somewhat. Are there any out there who are self-employed? My husband and I are. He is a visual artist/recording engineer and I have a small web design business. Have already had to turn down two accounts as I can't take on new clients right now. It is very frustrating and puts pressure on my husband. Am also trying not to scare my current clients. Have a strong reputation on giving quick service and hand holding. So have had to change some of my terms of service temporarily in anticipation of chemo. But the positive is that I do get to work out of my house for the most part. All the best to everyone. So glad you are willing to reach out.",

Am 48 w/ 2 teen daughters and married longer than my poor husband deserves. Have had a left mast and recovering well altho the doc says the form of cancer is very aggressive even tho it has not gone on a sight seeing tour of my body as far as they know. As a newbie to the boards, I will be reading up quite a bit. Am finding humor is one of the best tools and as such, I hope I do not offend those who may not find it so. Also am hoping that this experience will help guide me to being a better person overall. Who knows, stranger things have happened!  A friend told me that chemo is like the hangover to a great party you were too drunk to remember. So cheers and wishing everyone wel. Many thanks to those who have contributed to the forum.",

Cyborg and jackifp - It looks like non Carnivores are here. I eat some fish, but not other meat and have never quite developed a love of beans. Since we are to avoid soy products, do you know of a specific thread or place specifically discussing vegetarian meals while going through chemo? Glad it is the spring and fresh edibles are popping out of the ground.That's always a plus. Glad you are up and about cyborg.",

I am fairly private person usually, but live in a small town where everyone knows your biz. So figure that they will know I am bald - probably before I even go bald. Plan on having my best buds autograph my head w/ sharpie. (Will ask them for a light touch.) Figure people in casts get autographs, so why not? Have artists friends who are going to use their talent up there too. Will also wear scarves for the most part too, and possibly a wig. But plan on having fun w/ it.",
