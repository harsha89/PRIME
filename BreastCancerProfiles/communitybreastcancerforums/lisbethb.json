      "Content": "lisbethb wrote: My biopsy is Monday. Having an excisional because radiologist didn't think they could get a good enough view to do fine needle. It is a bummer because according to dr. the suspicious microcalcification is (his words) about the size of the tip of a sharpened pencil. I'm feeling optimistic, but do have a bit of angst. I've read some previous posts so feel like I know what to expect; they have to put me to radiology first to put the thin wires in to mark the spots where the dr. will do the surgery.Christmas is so close, I do hope I will get results before then! peace, Beth  Log in to post a reply",

My dr. still seems positive, and during the x-ray part the tech and the PA were reassuring that the speck of microcalcificatons were so very small. I should know something by Friday. The surgery part... I don't remember at all. The insertion of the wire was not that bad. Thanks everyone. I'll post my results when I get them. cheers, beth ",
