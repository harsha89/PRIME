I had a lumpectomy on Dec 27th and then a re-excision 1 week later where they removed several DCIS. Also had the sentinel node removed. My future, as of now, includes 6 weeks of radiation and hormone therapy. I didn't tell anyone in my family until the pathology report was complete. Because my mother and brother died withn 3 weeks of each other, I had to delay testing. I told my adult children but not my grandchildren. They would be too upset which would be hard for me to deal with. Does anyone else feel like this isjust a bad dream",
