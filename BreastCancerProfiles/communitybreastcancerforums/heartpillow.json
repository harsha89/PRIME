It scares me that they have not stopped or decreased. My Dr. does not seem worried.  Also, my arm aches so much, does anyone have any helpful tips for me? It hurts more when I walk and makes me really tired. Is this normal? I just keep worrying that I have an infection, but the Dr. says I am fine. Log in to post a reply",
