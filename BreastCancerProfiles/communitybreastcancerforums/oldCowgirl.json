At first I just thought I was getting a cold but I have no other signs of a cold. During the night my throat gets very sore, and hard to swallow, then during the day is get a little less sore, but then at night it returns again. I have not asked my Rad DR yet but I do plan to talk to her when I see her on Monday. The strange thing is, I am being treated on my right breast side from the neck down, but my throat is sore on the left side just under my jaw kinda were your tonsils are or in my case, would be.",
