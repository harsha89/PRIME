I am not a happy camper.  I did not get the nice results I got last time because it was a different surgeon.  I have a lump by my sternum.  I was told by another doctor I might need correct surgery by a plastic surgeon.  I also still have swelling under my arm and from the drain tube and she didn't even take any lymph nodes.  God help me if she had.   I will see surgeon #2 next week to see what she has to say about the lump.  But I am not worried about cancer, it was just poor surgery. So don't worry. Sassie62",
