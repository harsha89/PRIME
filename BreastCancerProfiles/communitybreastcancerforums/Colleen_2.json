I had 2 excisional biopsies.  Prior to the surgery I had a mamo wire insertion on my right breast and an ultra sound wire insertion on my left breast.  During the ultra sound insertion, the radiologist had a difficult time getting the wire in.  He had to keep jamming it and he apologized on being so rough and said that he was having a difficult time getting the wire where he needed it because whatever he had to go through was so \"hard\".  I have been trying not to think about it but every now and then I worry about it.  This is also the area where I had my first core needle biopsy so I was wondering if maybe it's scar tissue.  Can scar tissue be \"hard\" for the wire to get through? I guess I just worry because I have a lot of cysts but have never had anything hard.  I don't get my results until Aug. 12th so I was just hoping for someone to tell me that not all hard areas are cancer, that there are other things that can make it difficult for him to get through.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  Hugs to everyone.

The problem is that I am not on any regular cycle so to try and schedule to make sure it is in that time frame is going to be next to impossible.  They didn't have any openings in May with what we guessed could be the right time of the month so they booked me in for June 24th.  Here's hoping that ends up falling in the right time frame because I am not comfortable waiting any longer to get this done.  Back in August when the surgoen told me I had ADH, she wanted me to do some thinking about a double mastectomy and we would use these results to see if I should do it sooner or could wait until the next MRI.  Now it's going to be almost 10 months since I last saw her and had any tests done so I am getting anxious again about leaving things this long.  I'm just curious as to whether everyone else has to have their MRI's scheduled aroung their cycle or if this is just the way they do things here. ",

After a discussion with an aunt who is stage 4, she has me worried about just having tests once a year given our family history. I have scheduled an appointment with my surgeon (also my mom's surgeon for her BC) on Jan. 3 to have a discussion about whether I should just go ahead with the surgery. When I was diagnosed with ADH she recommended I have surgery at that time but supported my decision to just keep an eye on things. Now I am worried that maybe I'm just playing with fire by waiting. We will see what she says. Good luck with your appointment and let us know how you make out. I know this is all very stressful. Gentle hugs to you.",
