I started my chemo March 12, 2009.  I am in the heavy shedding of my hair stage.  I have an appointment with my hairdresser on Monday (day 18 post chemo one) to take off what ever is left.  I am okay with it.  I knew from the beginning that this was a definite possibility, so am ready to let it happen.  I placed an order from planet buff.  I also have a wig.  Had it styled on Wednesday and will have it adjusted (with no hair) on Monday. Have a great day everyone.",

I can see my pictures - they are posted April 3 at 7:45am and 7:52am.  Shoot.  I thought I had it figured out.  Any one know why I would be able to see pics but you can't? Good night will check back.",
