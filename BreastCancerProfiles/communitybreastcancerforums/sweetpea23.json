It would hit me like a wall in the afternoon, but everyone is different. I learned not to be out and about around that time. I had just the other regular side effects like burning, itching, etc..., but they can be managed w/ a bunch of creams. Good luck and take care.",

I think after I see the RO this week, I will make an appt w/ the MO, at least to get another second opinion if nothing else. I did not have the Oncotype test. I asked and was told because my tumor was so tiny (.6cm), it was not done. It is so hard to do all these appts while holding a job, kids in school, etc.... We have no family nearby so I rely on my friends and neighbors. I feel as if I am taking advantage of them but they are so good to me. Thanks again.",

The plan is for rads and then Tamox for 5 yrs. No chemo necessary. Do I really need to see a MO also? My BS said she could handle the tamox and futher exams for me. I am debating what to do. It means adding yet another Dr into the mix. Thanks for any suggestions. Dx 3/2012, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Went for only my 2nd yearly mam as all good girls should and then have been on this roller coaster ride ever since. Last week, I had the SNB and LX and now am waiting for all the path reports. Has to immediately go off BC pill after biopsy due to Est +.  Stress from this experience plus hormones out of whack have made me a real joy to be around. LOL. The stress levels have been much better now that action has been taken and we are moving on w/ treatment. One benefit, so to speak, of this whole situation has been the friends and family members who have gone on to schedule their mammograms. I have NO family history and this has thrown everyone for a loop. I have used this site as a main resource although I do have to take breaks from reading too much. I am the type of person who needs all the info I can get, but sometimes I just have to get away from it. I hopefully will find out tomorrow what treatment will be. The BS thinks it will be RAD and Tamox, but we shall see.  Thanks again. Dx 3/2012, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I seriously wonder what causes this when one does not have any of the major risk factors. I also now am concerned for my young daughter. I never thought she would have to worry either. My husband thinks I am nuts for even saying that, but he is a man. Enough said. Haha This site is great because the women on here understand.",

They did find out that the margins were not clean in one area so I have to go back in next week for reexcision. My upcoming radiation would probably take care of it but I am choosing to err on the side of caution and get those bad cells out. Not looking forward to it but it will be much less extensive than last week. Everyone keeps telling me how lucky I am and how I did the right thing but some days I don't feel that lucky. Oh well, must think positive thoughts and prayers for all!!",
