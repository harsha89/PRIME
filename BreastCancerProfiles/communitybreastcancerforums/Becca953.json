I saw you are Grade 1? This may be an indicator for the lack of response to chemo, because the faster growing Grade 3 tumors typically respond better to chemo. Recent research seems to be indicating that Neratinib is beneficial for the hormone driven HER2+ and Perjeta better for hormone negative. This is some newer data that has been coming in but not a final study. Also, some of the CDK 4/6 inhibitors for ER+ have been working well on the HER2 tumors. Also, there are some really promising drugs on the horizon with Tucatinib (ONT380) and Margetuximab and DS-8201. They also have some newer Herception combo drugs similar to TDM-1, so clinical trials are another option. Lastly, I have heard quite a few respond to TDM-1 (Kadcyla) but not regular Herceptin.",

On the plus side there are many effective targeted treatments, with Herceptin and Perjeta being the first two up to bat. Herceptin has been around for about 20 years. Perjeta is much newer since 2012. My guess is you will probably be on the neoadjuvant TCHP program, where they do chemo/targeted therapy first and then surgery. This is to try and shrink the tumor prior to surgery, and it also gives you the option of seeing how well the tumor responds to the standard treatments. Some women receive PCR (pathological complete response - meaning the tumor completely disappears) with the chemo beforehand, but for others it shrinks the tumor substantially. They will schedule you for a port which allows easy chemo delivery and blood draws. Hopefully, others will chime in with more info. Best of luck on Monday. This is a very supportive group with many helpful members full of useful advice and tips. Do not be afraid to ask questions.",

I think you are correct on the TDM-1 but I wonder about off label use for early non-responders. Interestingly, I had a Grade 2 tumor HER 2+++, with a KI-67 of 21%. The doctor at Johns Hopkins where I obtained a second opinion stated that is low KI-67 for HER2, and yours being substantially lower is interesting. However, I have seen a few other ladies on this forum with HER2 and very low KI-67 rates, just not many. My mitotic rate was a 1 which corresponds. I was concerned about chemo efficacy. MO told me, that these measurements for dividing cells are at \"that given moment\" so it is a fleeting glimpse and may vary. This is confusing to me. Is your doctor doing Tamoxifen or other hormone therapy? I may have missed this. There are so many treatments and meds available, just need to find one that works for you.",

It is recommended more and more to a wider group of patients. Also, the sarcoma risk is very small and it is something that typically occurs 20+ years later. Incidentally, there is also a risk of secondary cancer with chemotherapy. However, the immediate and short term benefits far outweigh what may happen decades later. You have to survive the now to reach the later. Another thing to keep in mind is that cancer treatments are advancing at record pace due to the human genome project completed in 2003. Targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and treatment vaccines are the new normal, although many need a chemo agent to jump start and assist them. Rather than focusing on chemotherapy most researchers are focusing on antigens and mutation targets. Pharmaceutical companies feel that the next 5-7 years are going to be groundbreaking in the cancer field. Curative? Who knows because cancer is complex. However, it will be more manageable. So, we all need to treat ourselves now with the best options we currently have to get to the future. If on the slim chance a sarcoma pops up in 20 years, there will most likely be better treatment. Remember statistics today reflect past medicine. You cannot predict future statistics because data from today's treatments will not be available until years from now.",

      "Content": "Sep 12, 2018 12:32PM - edited Sep 12, 2018 10:03PM by Becca953 Megsed, I am older than you at 47 but also in a similar boat. Genetic panels were negative, but my mother had it at 44, as did her paternal grandmother (she was in her 60s though.) I have one great aunt on my mother's side also affected, but that is it. My mother's sister is fine thus far at 70. I have no other relatives with it young other than my mother. Now, I was told by the genetic counselor I am at higher risk because I had it on one side. I also have dense breasts which is another risk factor. MO asked me what we are going to do with the other side last week. I honestly am torn but am leaning toward having it removed as well. However, my mother is still alive without recurrence 27 years later and had only one side removed, took Tamox for many years and did not undergo chemo or radiation. The drawback is another major surgery with chance of complications. The positives are I will have less to worry about every 6 months with imaging tests and hopefully things will be more even from a visual perspective, because it is difficult to get a real breast and a foob to match up, especially as gravity sets in. I think it is a very individual decision. Another factor for me, is my children are 11 and 15, so I will not be having any more, and I need to do what I can to be around for them. MO was also noncommittal and told me to sit on it for 6 months to a year. It could be a gene that has not yet been identified as I had 87 genes tested in January and now tests cover over 100. I would weigh the pros and cons, and discuss with family as well. Hopefully, some other well-informed ladies on here will be able to provide additional insight to guide your decisions. I will be following. This disease really stinks. I am hopeful that the billions we spend on research eradicate it sooner rather than later, so that others and my daughters do not have to deal with everything that goes along with it. Right now we have to do the best we can with what we have.",
