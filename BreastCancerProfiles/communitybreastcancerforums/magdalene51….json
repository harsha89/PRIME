I also got a chance to visit with the RO about the shoulder issue. She is adamant that the position is necessary in order to get a clear shot at the area. She feels that the rads are absolutely necessary because of the aggressive nature of the tumor. Even though my end of year PET scan was clear, that doesn't mean there aren't a whole bunch of cancer cells lurking about. The rads will reduce the chance of recurrence. So there's no way she's letting me off the hook. The problem with the shoulders, especially the left (cancer) side, has been around since 2005. In 2006 I had 2 surgeries to repair the rotator cuff, which had been sliced nearly in half by a bone spur. The 1st surgery failed due to over-aggressive PT. My current orthopedic specialist (who is not a surgeon) has told me that the only thing that can be done is complete shoulder replacements. There is no cartilage on the head of the humerus so every movement is bone on bone. You can actually hear it crunch. But I've not done anything about it because I didn't need to. When I talked to the pain doc the other day he said the only PT that might be helpful would be massage and light stretching. Not strengthening modalities. I've had years of PT with little improvement, finally just gave up. Shoulders \u2013 pfft! Who needs them?",

I didn't find the PET scan to be scary, but after the bmx, it was upgraded to IIIb, the lump that was measured at 3.8 cm on u/s turned out to be 5.8 cm when removed, and invasive into the chest muscle, some of which was also removed. I had elected to have bilateral for several reasons, although the surgeon said she could do a lumpectomy, she could never have gotten clear margins and it would have had to be a mastectomy in the end. As it turned out, there were pre-cancerous cells in the right breast as well, and my oncologist told me yesterday that the right breast, had it been left, would almost certainly become cancerous in a fairly short time. So I'm glad I went with my gut on that. Also, there is a node that lit up behind my sternum, which they could not remove without splitting the chest, so they left it, and that is the reason I have been moved to Stage IIIc now. I'm being presented to the radiation board as a good candidate for proton therapy, partly because of that node, and partly because with my tumor being on the left, proton is much more heart-sparing. I had my last chemo yesterday.  So I guess that node behind the sternum was the bad news after the PET, but to be honest, it didn't really register until I met with the radiation oncologist a few weeks ago. Best of luck, and do check back here and let us know how it turns out.",

It's not a good solution, as I can't just take them for rads, I have to take them regularly, because the positioning injures them all over again every day. I don't consider myself a litigious person, but I want someone to pay for this (not money, but some kind of consequences). I had no pain in my right shoulder before RO sent me to PT. Now the pain is a constant 8, peaking to 10 on occasion. I think the rotator cuff has been damaged. Our rads room does have a backlit sky scene on the ceiling, but I can't see it because my head is turned away and the table is moved to my right to radiate my left side. There is no music, nor offer of any. I am able to play music in my head, but what I've been doing lately is saying the Rosary. I'm not a Catholic now, but I've found the combination of prayer and repetition is helpful to lose track of time. Personal prayer didn't work as the pain was so distracting, but using the rosary as a kind of mantra has been helpful.",

She was a linchpin on our July chemo thread and kept us going when we were on our knees crawling to the john. My rads have been delayed for one reason and another. First, I had a lump that needed bx, turned out just fat necrosis. Then they did the sim before Thanksgiving. I didn't know if I was going to make it. I have horrible arthritis in both shoulders, but the left one is worse, and that's the tumor side. They called me in for practice session before Christmas, but there was a snag (literally, the machine wouldn't pass my elbow) so they had to do some re figuring. In the meantime, that flared up the shoulder so badly I called them and said I wasn't going to go ahead, couldn't take that every day for weeks. RO was upset, asked if she could refer me to pain management, I said ok. The pm doc said he could do a nerve block and see how that works. So that was done yesterday, and the relief is immense. So I am scheduled for first tx in 2 hours. The nerve block is short term, so we will see how long. There is an additional thing he can do to make it last longer, but pointless to do it before we knew if it worked. I haven't read through the whole thread, but I'll try to catch up.",

Yesterday I went for my first rads and learned that the nerve block doesn't fix the source of the pain from the positioning. I have to have my arm at 180° and there is a bone spur that hits when I'm in that position. Yesterday's session was nearly half an hour in that position so it was ice when I got home. They've gone ahead and scheduled the rads as if there were no issues, without even talking to me about it, which annoyed me. The pain doc did say that he could prescribe a lidoderm patch for local pain, so I'm going to ask for that. I have my second session this afternoon. Thank you for your kind words, Coyote, but as I recall you were the one who did the heavy lifting in the July thread as I slipped into chemo fog. You are the awesomest.",

The MRI showed \"Int mammary nodes not usually seen on MRI\" whatever that means. I do not remember seeing any notation that \"mets\" was reserved to distant metastasis. Once it's on the move, does it matter so much to where? However, for the sake of harmony, I shall remove the designation. (By the way, the question in the dx section reads: \"If your breast cancer is not recurrent, is it metastatic?\" It's multiple choice. What else should I have put?)",

      "Content": "Nov 16, 2017 12:00AM - edited Nov 16, 2017 06:15PM by magdalene51 You ladies are so kind to welcome me into your circle. Believe me, I am rarely alone! My cousin, who is a very vigorous 80, has lived with us for 6 years and takes very good care of me. My biggest challenge with the financial/paperwork mess is that I'm the one that has to make the phone calls. Most places will not accept a proxy at least without power of attorney, which also requires a phone call/appointment/meeting with the estate attorney. I am simply hamstrung by this fatigue, complicated by interrupting waves of grief. The following is a bit long, but I wanted to share with you the amazingly delicate way my husband's eulogist and long time friend explained what led to his death. He is a theologian so it's a bit deep in places. It was originally written for my facebook page when DH was in a coma, and revised for his service program. Targeted for Destruction \u2013 Downfall of a Good Fellow Soldier of Christ While Tolkien's Elves ironically termed mortality as \"the gift of men,\" the Apostle Paul describes death as an enemy, to eventually be destroyed in the light of eternal life and truth of divine love. Thus do Christians hate the devil, the father of lies and aboriginal murderer (John 8:44). Within this larger warfare we lament the demise of our dear friend, Christian brother, and most beloved husband David. Although all are imperfect with many faults, David seemed in some ways too good for this dark world, which he brightened at every point he touched it. As his long-time friend and fellow labourer in the fields of the Lord, I saw him wield his ministry upon the dramatic stage where I met him as my director. In this sphere alone did David touch thousands of lives for the better. Then he strongly supported my bid to re- enter the academic arena in hopes to make contributions that will in that way build up Christ's kingdom. And many others will testify to other such fruits born from David's obedient love and selfless giving acts. Truly, he has long been a \"good and faithful servant\" (Matthew 25:21). For such reasons the enemy of our souls craftily abused even his deep and abiding love for his wife in order to ensnare him in despair\u2013 \u2013a tactic that has reduced many a good person in the history of this present darkness in which we must abide as best we may for all too short a time. Succumbing to the subtle temptation to hopelessness, David inherited (we think) a predisposition to alcohol abuse, which was apparently the concealed weapon by which he was isolated from supporters and led, despairingly, to seek escape from this world of woe. Suffering general failure of major organs\u2013\u2013liver, lungs, kidneys, heart\u2013 \u2013David was kept alive by machinated methods in a state of induced coma, unresponsive, yet loved ones\u2013\u2013friends, fellow-workers, family from afar, his everlasting helpmate \u2013\u2013 all spoke to him, just in hopes he might hear. Eventually he came around enough, thankfully, before the end to bid farewell to his wife, for whom we pray unceasingly in this dark hour. Let us all pull together in loving support of one another, trusting to \"the Shepherd and Guardian of our souls\" (1 Peter 2:25), and not lose the blessed hope (Titus 1:2) that we will be reunited with David in a more peaceful place. A place, as Sam sang amidst Mordor's darkness of despair, \"where stars forever dwell,\" immune to the stormy clouds obscuring our tiny portion inside the vast reality of God's eternal love.",

I asked MO how long I could expect if I stopped treatment completely. He said 4 to 6 months tops. Kinda sobered me up. As it happened, the next scan showed progression, so he switched me to Xeloda, which put me in remission in 6 months. But that's the only time he's said anything about it and only because I asked about quitting entirely. Guess I wasn't as ready as I thought. Now I'm actively engaged in living.

Two nights ago my neighbor dropped by to introduce herself and she said the neighborhood\u2019s semi-annual garage sale is Friday and Saturday.

So I\u2019ve been haunting amazon, Wayfair, overstock, chewy, etc. decorating the new house has been something of a challenge, as I\u2019ve had to tussle with my dislike of shopping, while enjoying finding nice things that I really like - something I\u2019ve never been able to do, always having had to compromise with DH, whose tastes were very different from mine. I\u2019ve consulted with DC, because she will live here when I\u2019m gone, and because we don\u2019t differ too much in taste- she actually does pretty well buying clothes for me.

As I see it, it\u2019s the chemothat caused the domino effect of the last 5 months: Gemzar -> vasculitis -> DVT -> pulmonary embolism. I see a clear line of cause and effect, even if it can\u2019t be verified. Things continued to go downhill when I was switched to abraxane, which tells me that although it might not have been doing any further damage, it is quite possible that it was, and even that it was doing more damage than can be known. I just decided it was time to stop playing Russian roulette with my health, however much time I have left. Ok I\u2019m done (and done in!) for the night! Go sleepy bye as I tell my fur babies.

I'm also having trouble with the tumor behind the esophagus which sometimes causes food to build up and get stuck. I've also had a couple of emergency diarrhea instances so the commode has reappeared by the bed. Hospice nurse suggested increasing the time release pain med but oncologist fears respiratory distress so he prefers that I use the breakthrough meds as often as needed.

I may not take an absolute loss, but depending how we do it, I could be out of pocket 30-40k in repairs/updates to just break even. Although realtor and I disagree about what updates would be necessary. I know there are things like the vanity fixtures in all bathrooms, which are corroded, bathroom light fixtures which just don\u2019t work where they\u2019re installed, and I\u2019d just as soon provide a flooring allowance rather than actually doing the replacement. Same with painting throughout; I am of the opinion that people would rather make their own choices about paint and flooring. But maybe that\u2019s just me. About my son, I\u2019m pretty sure he never expected any inheritance from me at all. First of all, he\u2019s not DH\u2019s son, and all this inheritance would come from what he provided. Second, my son was born when I was 18 and single (by the way, I\u2019lll be 67 in April), and I placed him for adoption as an infant. I didn\u2019t want to, but it really was the best thing, and he has had so many benefits and opportunities I couldn\u2019t have provided. I began searching for him in his teens, and nearly obsessing about it until I finally left it in God\u2019s hands, made sure my information was available to him should he ever go looking, and dropped it. July 10, 2005, I received an email forwarded from one of the mutual consent adoption registries, saying, \u201cI think I\u2019m who you\u2019re looking for.\u201d And indeed he was. It took him about 15 minutes to find me, but he was 35 at the time, and both of us had pretty much worked through all our issues, and came with no unrealistic expectations, and we have had a wonderful relationship, more deeply bonded each year. There\u2019s lots more to the story, but my hands are tired and I\u2019m fighting a headache. Hangover from meltdown yesterday I suppose. Still haven\u2019t gotten that nap.

I posted a couple of times back in November, you may or may not remember, not long after my husband\u2019s death and you were so supportive. I\u2019ve kept up a bit but thought I\u2019d post an update on my progress. So far, to our knowledge, I continue to be in remission. PET scan scheduled for early March. My cousin/caregiver/housemate and I went to Michigan to spend the holidays with my sister. I spent most of the three weeks huddled in bed. It never got above freezing, and my sister\u2019s household is chaotic. But at least I wasn\u2019t here. And I got to see a bunch of family members. And my sweet doggo Rose got to accompany me everywhere as an Emotional Support Animal. My PCP was happy to write paperwork on her. She traveled like a pro, lying quietly on my lap through airports, restaurants, plane rides, etc. What a comfort. And I am finally working on carrying through with something that started going through my head almost 7 years ago, when DH and I bought this house, and I had my first cancer dx. And that is, I don\u2019t want to die in this house. So yesterday I made an offer on a house that started speaking to me the minute I saw the thumbnail of it, and couldn\u2019t get it out of my head. If this all comes together it will definitely be a miracle. It fits us perfectly, our lifestyle, our guests, our animals, etc. It\u2019s actually slightly larger than our current place, but we are downsizing our contents drastically. And since I have neither the strength nor energy to do so, I was referred to a company called Caring Transitions. I met with the local franchise owner the other day, and they offer a full range of options for helping folks like us move, downsize, sell our stuff, etc. Their pricing seems reasonable. Basically I won\u2019t need to lift a finger, only make decisions about what to keep, etc., and I can even have my friends help with sorting & packing, to help reduce the costs. So there\u2019s my update and a recommendation. I\u2019ll be checking in from time to time.",

And surely her DD will understand. As close as you are to her, she is not blind to her mother's toxicity, and she also undoubtedly loves you enough to understand the effect it has on you. I'd have a heart to heart with her, maybe with both DDs. That's my two cents. As for the gift, most registries have online shopping you can access, so see if she has registered somewhere that has that option. MJH, thought you might appreciate a pic of the place we lived when we first moved to Camden, it was right on the bay, you could see Curtis Island from the house. As you can see, there is a long stretch of lawn that leads to the water, what you can't see is that the edge is actually about a 20' cliff down to the rocks. Looking at the house on Google Earth, I can see that the owners have remodeled and added a whole lot of square footage! When we rented it it was a simple Cape Cod with the exception of the sun porch having been incorporated into the living area and a bank of picture windows looked out to the water. So nice. I can't even imagine what it must be like now!  ",

I want to send a special hug to holmes as I am sadly too familiar with that kind of loss. It tore my heart to read it. Mic, a belated happy birthday and congratulations on a return to normal. All the memories you have been sharing, so bittersweet. I have a picture frame DH bought a couple years ago, one of those you put a flash drive in and it cycles through the pictures, and I set it on a table where it\u2019s always visible - maybe not such a great idea after all. The other day as I was feeling nostalgic, watching the pictures fade in and out, I was recalling the year each one was made. It made me somehow even sadder. So many pictures of him, healthy and happy, and then the last one that was taken of him, at our 30th anniversary party,, smiling but not happy, and so jaundiced. How did i not see it? But I did. I just couldn\u2019t fix it. I\u2019m glad though, that he can\u2019t see me now. I had 2 abraxane tx before they stopped because my inflammation levels were getting out of hand again, and I couldn\u2019t breathe. I\u2019d walk the few steps to the toilet and back to bed and be gasping for breath. I finally got in to see the rheumatologist who consulted in the hospital, and - long story short - he and my oncologist put their heads together and put me back on 40 mg prednisone until we figure out what\u2019s causing it. Yesterday I had a temporal artery biopsy to rule out (or in) giant cell arteritis, a type of vasculitis that affects the carotid system. I had a stat PET scan last week which was inconclusive for the inflammation issue, but found no cancer progression, so I will restart abraxane next week. The major development is that I am now on 24/7 oxygen, and while it does help, when I get up and move around I still have problems. Then there\u2019s the little annoyance of my persistent taxotere drippy nose fighting with the oxygen cannula. I need a drip cup. When I was on oxygen in the hospital I asked for a mask instead, and I\u2019ll probably do that again. The 2 abraxane tx were sufficient to loosen all my hair, so I visited my friendly hairdresser and I am now butch again. It will be nice and cool for the summer, should I ever be able to be outside. Fortunately I have not had any further cardiac events, although the occasional discomfort tells me I am not entirely out of the woods. One problem with diagnosing this inflammation is that since I was back on the prednisone for a few days before any testing, that may have compromised the results. But the rheumatologist dragged his feet, said he was doing research, which I understand because this is a rare occurrence, but had I waited any longer to go back on it, some of the damage could be irreversible. As it is, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been recertified for Home Health visits for another 2 months. I\u2019m so frustrated by the inactivity, though, and my house is unfinished! I have so much I want to do, and even with the oxygen I\u2019m still so weak and limited. I don\u2019t want other people having to do what I should be doing! Well, my Rose says it\u2019s bedtime, she wants her nini treat and she wants it Right Now! Nini ladies, I\u2019ll try to fill in the blanks for you if you want...",

      "Content": "May 31, 2018 11:56PM - edited May 31, 2018 11:57PM by magdalene51 Good evening, ladies. It's taken a bit, but I think I managed to get caught up. My apologies for being absent. Mic, like everyone else I am horrified at the disrespect and abuse you've had from those two children. I just want to say that the mosti important thing you can do, and must do, right now, is to take care of yourself. If you recall, I was in remission last September, and after the stress of DH's death and cleaning up the mess he left, and making some hard decisions about the future, the very next scan showed the cancer exploding all over. It's true that stress is a killer, and you can't afford it. I agree that if there's any way you can temporarily displace yourself, it would be beneficial. And I don't think leaving the utilities off is a step too far, since they have not contributed to the costs. Food too. As for the reception venue, I would cancel that sucker and not tell them; let them find out the hard way. We all know that you love your daughter, but she is abusing you and you are enabling her in it. And it can destroy you, in a very real sense, putting an emotional stress on an already failing body. You must take care of yourself! Now I've lost track of what everyone else was saying. I got the biopsy report, it's negative, and the PET showed no cancer progression so I start back on abraxane tomorrow. I'm now on 24/7 oxygen, and though I feel much better & stronger, it's still hard to get around, and as soon as I take it off, I feel like I can't get a deep breath. And I don't even notice the cannula now, except when my Taxotere drippy nose acts up. One last thing, Mic. Buying this house, moving here, it's probably saved my life. It's become a sanctuary for me, an inner sanctum, a place of peace and healing of heart if not body. You cannot live for your daughter, and she doesn't want you to. Live for you, and your DH. You two deserve it.",

We had great fun. My niece is now 26 and this May will graduate from college in NYC with a degree in theater arts. DH was her coach and mentor, her second dad, and she is so heartbroken.

Knitted knockers sent me a pair, and I discovered when I was clearing out my old bras (sent them to a local women\u2019s shelter) that one of the old cheap Walmart bras had pockets, with the slit on the outside to slide the knockers in. So on the rare occasions I wear them, they work just fine. I didn\u2019t want to have to part with some of my favorite blouses that have darts. And they\u2019re closer to a C-D than the DDDs I carried around with me before. Whew! Those suckers must\u2019ve weighted a good 10-12 pounds apiece! But I could probably count on my fingers how many times I\u2019ve worn those foobs. Grannax, thank you for your encouraging words. I actually do have a muscle relaxer, Tizanidine, been on it for years, but I\u2019ve mostly taken it in the evening for restless leg while sleeping. I\u2019ve been tossing them down like breath mints lately though, just fighting these stupid muscle spasms. Sometimes moving sets them off but there are times they come spontaneously. Ouch! Speaking of cymbalta, I was on it for several years (prescribed in conjunction with Lyrica, and all for my fibromyalgia) and the doc would keep increasing the dosages of them trying to find some relief for my pain. Finally, about 5-6 years ago, when I had maxed out on both of them and still no relief from the pain, I decided it was a waste to continue and asked the doc to help me step down. She did, I did, and even going down as gradually as possible, it was the worst withdrawal ever. I fought the depression and suicidal thoughts constantly. It took forever (it seemed( to get back on an even keel. The Lyrica wasn\u2019t as rough, but while I was on it I gained (literally) 100 lbs. After I stopped it I dropped about 50 in a short time. Kept it off quite a while, but something that I\u2019m on now is causing it to creep back up. It could be the Xeloda, or maybe the chocolate ice cream. (Ya think?) Micmel, I believe I\u2019ll hang around awhile. It actually wasn\u2019t so much needing a break, it was that every waking moment was filled with financial panic. I think I mentioned before that DH had handled our finances for probably 20-25 years, and I was happy to let him. We both made fairly decent money, I had my own business, but he resisted planning for the inevitable - even after what his family went through after his folks died. For one thing, we used the income from my business as a kind of slush fund - vacations, houses, etc., and never put a dime of it aside for a retirement plan for me. And I begged for it. He was convinced that his would be sufficient (and it may be) but the stress of working everything out is wearing. And trying to figure everything out, back in November, took every one of my meager brain cells. Figuring out what bills we even had, tracking down how each one was paid (mostly online, but from the bank site or the payee\u2019s site?) then slowly transferring the payee site payments to the bank site so I can track all in one place, from my phone. Still not completely done with that task. Then, setting up the trust that will take care of my cousin (provided she survives me, as she most certainly will (both her parents lived to 95+), getting started on SS and Medicare, supplements, more figuring, figuring, figuring out. I\u2019d best close for now before I lose this post. More later.",

The email address is found under contacting moderator or something. My thought was, there could be multiple sites we want to contact, for various reasons, and it might make sense to make a folder of \"send after death\" and write out the emails ourselves. No passwords needed, nothing disclosed. What say you all?

Meet neighbors, find or recommend services, sell your things, find your pet, report a stalker, both in your own neighborhood and in the ones nearby (we have 56).

All of a sudden, the last couple days in the hospital, the hospitalist and the social worker started pressuring me to decide on a skilled nursing facility to go to before going home. There was only one that had been highly recommended personally, so I said I\u2019d go there. Thought it was all settled until the next day the social worker stopped by to tell me that facility had declined to have me. She thought it had something to do with the cancer treatment and liability, which made no sense to me. My cousin actually talked to them and found that it\u2019s an issue with continuum of care:they offer the full spectrum, and want patients who will commit to that, and since my plan is to die in my own bed, that wouldn\u2019t happen. Of course, that little glitch only increased the pressure. That\u2019s when I began to talk to the hospital\u2019s hospice arm, and it seemed a perfect fit. As a member of thes forums for 4 years, I\u2019ve seen so many women who have lived for literally years on hospice, some have gone on and off again, and very few who have gone on hospice and died within a short time. So I have perhaps a different approach and attitude toward the whole situation than most, certainly than the hospitalist who discharged me with a whole long list of meds (and supplements!) that I should just stop taking because they won\u2019t contribute to my comfort (something he obviously knows little about, as without my large doses of magnesium my bowels become quite uncomfortable!) Also, these are supplements I have bought and paid for, and if hospice doesn\u2019t want to cover them, it\u2019s ok because they are not cost-prohibitive. So my cousin and I met with the hospice rep Thursday afternoon, and the ball was rolling. Equipment was delivered - right now I\u2019m keeping me bed but I have a trapeze so I can move around a little easier and also get in shape for the pole dancing competitions this fall - just kidding! There may have been some misunderstanding or misinformation about what landed me in the hospital this time. I had something called a saddle pulmonary embolism, which happens when blood clots block both pulmonary arteries. I nearly died Tuesday morning as my blood pressure was dangerously low. Subsequent tests showed blood clots in my right leg, which had apparently been sloughing off and sticking in the pulmonary arteries until the proverbial straw broke the camel\u2019s back late Monday morning. My cousin described me as white, cold, and drenched with sweat. It was touch and go for 24 hours, and when they wee out of options, there was only a \u201ckill-or-cure\u201d option. It\u2019s called TPA, and the ICU doc was pretty sure a full dose would do me in, but he might be able to give me half a dose. I must have agreed, because it worked. I trusted this ICU doc, because last October, when my DH lay in the bed 3 rooms away, this doc was straight with me about the prognosis. He pulled no punches, didn\u2019t sugar coat, told me the truth, and so I knew I could trust him. And he saved my life. Apparently God\u2019s not through with me yet. So, no, I\u2019m not home to die. I\u2019m home to refocus. To turn my sights away from the battle and turn toward some housekeeping: taking care of people and things that have needed my attention. Trust me, when it\u2019s my time, you\u2019ll see the drama queen make a few curtain calls before riding off into the sunset (metaphor alert!). Mik, you are an awesome threadkeeper, just stay the course. You\u2019ve pulled together a great group of gals and even when I don\u2019t post, I read and keep up. Love you all. ",

After my second infusion of Gemzar, I began to have fevers. Ended up in hospital being cultured for every infection under the sun to no avail!

A rheumy was consulted, prednisone administered, things turned around and I was on my way to normal, with some possible long-term ramifications. In the meantime, things moved ahead toward my house closing, and on my last day in the hospital, a mobile notary came to my room and walked me through signing all the closing documents. The movers moved the heavy furniture over that afternoon, and set up my bed, my cousin made the bed, and I was released later that afternoon and came home to my new house and went straight to bed! These two weeks have been a whirlwind of unpacking, (still sorting!), figuring things out, running back and forth to the old house, home health nurses, PTs, OTs, and last week my son was here all week from Florida!

I'd been sitting quietly in a chair in my closet while my organizing genius Lori was helping me decide what to keep and what could go. It was not stressful. When the pain started, I went and lay down on the bed, took my bp, it was 176/84. Took a nitro. Bp dropped, repeated twice until bp was normal range (it's a protocol I was taught). Seemed to be recovering, pain had gone from 8/10 at peak to 2/10. About 20 minutes later it started to rise so I called 911 and they took me to ER. But really the second one never got anywhere and by the time we left I was pretty much normal. My EMS tech was an awesome lady and we had a good conversation on the way to ER. Once there, they started trying to get an IV despite my protestations (\u201cI have a port!\" \u201cI know it looks like a good vein but trust me, it will roll!\" And it did, twice.) Finally got someone who could access my port, go to blood drawn. Results showed no heart attack, but angina. So they sent me home. With 2 big new bruises to go with 4 still left from nearly a month ago. Mic, about those teeth\u2026 picture 1 is me in April 2015, one month after finishing rads. Finished chemo previous October. Picture 2 is April 2017, just befor surgery to remove them all. I have another picture I took right after one fell out in October of 2016 that shows most of the damage happened in the first 18 months following active treatment. I showed one of the teeth to my MO and he confirmed it's systemic damage.   I miss steak most of all. A nice, thick, marbled ribeye like my DH masterfully grilled to perfection. Or when he could find one, a boneless ribeye roast, which he also cooked on the grill. Oh my. ",

My husband apparently began drinking in secret not long after my dx, and hid it very successfully from me, because i trusted him. When he had his first episode of liver disease, he swore it was from the acetaminophen he\u2019d been taking for sinus headaches - and that may well have been a contributing factor, but the wine didn\u2019t help. Some 15 years earlier, he had watched his beloved mother die of throat cancer. So when I was dxed, all he could think was he would have to watch me die too. I think he was determined to go first, and he did. If I could go back and live those days over, one thing I would do is talk more, spend more time with him just talking it over. I think he never really adequately grieved the loss of his mom, and so was unprepared to lose me. I long ago accepted that this beast would kill me, so I was probably unnecessarily blasé about dying. I\u2019m sure that didn\u2019t help matters. Just don\u2019t let it slide, Minnie. My husband died of cirrhosis and multiple organ failure, but mostly of a broken heart. Talk to him, love on him, take his pain seriously. If he\u2019s drinking, he\u2019s trying to numb the pain. Help him find a better way. Be a better wife than I was. And keep in touch. Much love.",

I am devastated. We MBC think we will go first, and here I am left behind. Not only that, but he made no preparations, and left our finances in chaos.

It has been the best choice, for this room and for all of us. He has slept out here with me all but one night. Last night we celebrated the 27th anniversary of the day we met, DH grilled us a ribeye, my cousin (who lives with us) fixed corn on the cob and potato salad. Then we settled in the pit group and watched Despicable Me 2. Good times.  I know I haven't posted for a while, but I added this thread to my favorites and visit daily. A reminder that life goes on, the joys, sorrows, trials, travels, challenges. And lurking somewhere in each life, this enemy we fight, and we all add our voices to drown it out.

So we were very fortunate there. Last fall however, I was not so fortunate, as my DH died completely unprepared. I didn\u2019t even have passwords to pay bills. Had to figure out everything for myself, make all the funeral arrangements, plan everything, all while continuing treatment. What a mess! I think the worst of it for me was the anger at the unnecessary complications, which greatly interfered with my ability to properly grieve the loss of my life partner of 30 years. More than 6 months later, I\u2019m still dealing with some of the mess! We had no children together; my son is 48 now and very settled, so there was not that complication, but while I was actually in remission while all that was going on, my first scan afterward showed an explosion of mets in the lungs and bones, and as I\u2019ve subsequently been dealing with this inflammation issue and not breathing well, I\u2019ve also supervised moving to a new home (my first solo purchase), liquidating 30 years of accumulation, an estate sale, and now selling the old house - I get tired just thinking about what all is left. One of the first things I did last fall however was meet with an estate attorney and set up a trust to take care of my cousin (who is also my housemate and caregiver), as DH and I committed to when she first came to take care of me years ago. Ironically, she is 81, 14 years my senior, but she is still in good health and has a caregiver\u2019s heart - a trait she obviously shares with you. Prior to the estate sale, I invited local family and close friends to help themselves to whatever they wanted, and gave a lot of stuff away. I still have way too much, but since I don\u2019t know how long I have, or whether I will regain enough health to enjoy life again, I don\u2019t want to be precipitous.",

I\u2019ve become so much more aware the past few months that although the cancer itself may not be progressing, so much damage has been done, not only to my lungs with the mets but to my heart with whatever else is going on - possibly a rare side effect of gemzar, vasculitis. In any case, I\u2019m on a relatively high dose of prednisone until the source of the inflammation is tracked down and a real tx plan can be devised. In any case, an angina attack a few weeks ago reminded me that I may not have a lot of warning or time to prepare, or the typical end stage scenario. And now I\u2019m too sick and weak to do any physical preparation. But I suppose, in the end, none of us will know, until we do.",
