So I have to have another mammogram and ultrasound in 6 months to see if there is any change. I had a complete hysterectomy 32 years ago and have been on estrogen ever since. I am 64 years old. I am the lowest dose of estrogen, but the doctor wants to increase it, even after the fact I have to have another mammogram due to the changes.  I don't feel comfortable increasing the estrogen until further test show I am OK My right breast has always been sensitive.  But in November when I had my breast exam by the doctor, who was actually quite gentle. I had horrible pain in my right breast only for 4 days.  Since then my breast either has sharp pains run through it that will knock me on my bottom, or there is a dull aching pain. Should I tell the doctor the pain in my breast is increasing and should we do some other testing.  I did find out that I was extremely low on vitamin D and the doctor told me to increase my dosage. Please help me,should I be concerned?  Log in to post a reply",
