I was not able to have adriomycin because of heart problems so they started me off with taxol. After the 12 treatments, my BC had spread to my liver. I'm now on Xeloda and waiting to see how this does. I'll have a scan in a couple of months. I do think it is helping because the pain around my abdomen that I had is no longer there. They told me initiallyÂ it was the tumor that was causing the pain. I'm praying that I will be NED also because I never got to have my masectomy and my breast hurts and is inflamed! I just want that out. Has anyone else been able to have a masectomy after being diagnosed stage IV?",

By the 4th day of the 14 day period, my pain went away completely. So, it only took 17 days total with 11 of them being on Xeloda. I didn't like the 14 day on and 7 day off schedule, so they allowed me to go back on the 7 day on 7 day off schedule with the lower dose.",

I started out with liver mets and had the same side effects with it that you have - pain in stomach when I ate, no appetitite, etc. My onc. put me on Xeloda and I have had great success with it after only 2 rounds - no more pain. I do still have a low appetite but that could be from the chemo. My nurse said I could just eat 6 small meals if I need to rather than 3 regular ones. I'll be praying for you that you have sucess as well.",
