I think I will only do this because he did the comparisons first.",

I have an appointment with him on the 8th so I'll raise that with him then. I live in Sydney Aust. and I believe that our treatment is slightly different. I am not a candidate for the stomach tissue implant so they will do an immediate silicon reconstruction. My surgeon told me that you don't use silicon in the US any more but he assures me that it is safe here now and my best option.",

I had an operation 12 months ago to remove a non cancerous papiloma lump removed which all went well but after 6 months I started to feel a change again. Thinking that it was just the breast tissue adjusting to the operation I left it and now I've been told that it has come back and the radioligist recordings classify it as ADH. I've now been told that my best option would be to have a NSM although they still don't believe that it's cancer (1 - 5% chance). I'm 45 and terrified and depressed at the thought but feel that I don't have any options. If I go with a lumpectomy they say that the breast will be deformed and there is a chance it will return anyway. I have a 60 year old cousin on my mother's side that had a Mastectomy due to cancer but otherwise no other history. Can anyone help with any advise on this? I haven't told family or close friends as yet as I know they won't understand given that it's not cancer at this stage. I'm due to have the operation on the 28th of April.",

      "Content": "Apr 19, 2011 04:36PM - edited Apr 19, 2011 10:43PM by SaraAust Thanks ladies for all your experiences and my prayers are with you all. I am booked in to have the NSM on the 28th of April and now that I have told family it's been much easier to accept. I did raise the MRI with my surgeon & he said that he and his colleagues would still recommend the same thing whether it was cancer or not given that it came back so quickly and its size. I am only small breasted (not quite 34B) and a lumpectomy would be significantly large, causing my breast to be distorted, he believes that I would need reconsruction anyway due to this, so in his opinion and the PS they don't see the difference if I were to remove all the tissue and reconstruct or just part of the breast. This was said in a very understanding way and I guess it makes sense so again I don't feel like I have a choice. I am terrified of going through this once again if I don't go ahead, as it's the second time around, plus I went through this fear 10 years ago when I had a melonoma removed from my neck while I was pregnant with my second child. I didn't go through chemo as they removed a lymp node to test if it had spread and it hadn't. It's true that reading these posts helps tremendously but I have to admit some information is very daunting. For instance, there was a post who described the feel of the implant as cold and uncomfortable after 18 months. I know that I'll never feel the same again and I guess the unknown is always scary but in the end I'm just praying that it's not cancer and I don't have to deal with this again. All the very best to everyone out there who is having to deal with this hideous disease and I hope the love and support of family, friends and websites like this helps you get through it as best as you can and let you know that you are not alone. For me it feels like no one around me really understands what it feels like to be going through this fear so everyone sharing their experiences on this site makes a massive difference. Thanks again for any advise.",
