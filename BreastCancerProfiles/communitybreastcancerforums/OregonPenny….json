I had mine placed in my upper right chest on Monday and it is still very painful. I just wonder will it always be painful? My first chemo treatment is Thursday the 2nd. I forgot to take my list with me shopping but came back with everything I could think of except I forgot about the mouth rinse. I haven't purchased a wig yet either but I found some hats online that I really like. I'm more afraid about starting the chemo than I was when I had the mastectomy. GROUP HUG!",

I'm scheduled to have a port inserted on the 29th because I have awful veins too.  My name is Penny, I'm 49 years old and live in Sweet Home, Oregon. I have two adult children, a daughter Cassie married to Jared and a son Andrew who is married to Amie. I have a 5 year old grandson Trenton who I adore. I also have another grandbaby due in November. I was diagnosed with idc of the left breast and had a bi-lateral mastectomy on August 22nd. I elected to have the bi-lateral even though there was no evidence of cancer in the right breast and only 5-10% chance that it would occur. Partly because I didn't want to chance ever having to go through this again but also because it was the only part of this treatment that I've felt any kind of control over. I had the tissue expanders placed at the same time as the surgery in preparation for reconstruction. The actual implants will be 6 months or so from now after things settle down from the chemo. I'm glad I stumbled upon this site because it will be very helpful to know we are all going through this together. I'm not at all happy about the hair loss but at least it will be winter here and I won't be so out of place in a stocking cap",
