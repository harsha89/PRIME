The incisions looking the way they do makes me feel terrible & I can't start the filling process till I'm healed. & now I have 2 go back & have the dead tissue removed. So I assume that will take time 2 heal & still can't start the filling process. These TE r so uncomfortable & I really need 2 get back 2 work. I'm a single mother of 2 & can't stay out of work much longer. I was told I could work with the TE in but didnt think it would b this terrible.",

These TE are terrible & I don't think I can work them & getting back 2 work is essential! If I have them removed when they go back in 2 remove the dead tissue I have, how long would healing take?",

It's always his assistant. She assures me that the way I'm healing just happens sometime. Plus I had my last chemo July 5 & had my surgery on July 31st so that may have made my healing process slower. But not seeing the actual surgeon scares me. But @ this point I don't think I can handle these expanders. I'm 36 & a single mom of 2 so thinking about being single with no breasts scares me 2",

These expanders r terrible. I have more skin then I thought I would & still look like I have small breasts. Can I have then expanders removed & get a small implant or so I have 2 have the fills done?
