Now my med onc will finally see me this coming Tues to check on me and discuss how to move forward with alternative treatment.......why does it have to take something so severe to get people to listen?? This has been extremely frustrating and I have never felt so alone and beaten up both physically and emotionally........just wondering if there are others going through this??

Texas--Kudos to you for getting through all of your tx on this drug and good to hear that you had no scarring.  I agree with you about the Decadron.....haven't slept properly since I've been on it but it seems to be having some effect on my face.  The skin on my neck and hands is completely peeling away now, but again, this is hopefully part of the healing process.  I did have mouth issues but more so after the first tx.  I used their prescribed mouth wash after the second tx when I felt these same se's starting and it stopped it from getting worse.  My nails on my hands started changing colours after the first tx but I used the cooling mitts during and after the second tx and it seems to have reversed this condition.  All the best to you!! MicheleS--Thanks for your post and kind words.  I had read about Abraxane before my second tx and brought it up with the resident doc and \"supply onc\" but was told it is not used in Canada??!!  I will be asking my actual onc about this again tomorrow.  I have also printed off the Taxotere Dosage Manual from the manufacturer which suggests if a reaction similar to mine occurs, that they recommend lowering the dose.......will question why this wasn't done.  Take care and hugs to you too!! Anna--Wow my se's seem small compared to what you are going through....sooo sorry!!  I applaud your strength and perseverance but find myself questioning why your onc is not providing you with an alternative tx option.  It does however sound as though she is listening and doing what she can to help alleviate your se's.  This is all hard enough without having to go through your many horrible se's!  All the best to you and I hope you have an easier time of it on your last tx. Bettysgirl--I completely agree......FEC was a walk in the park compared to Taxotere.  In fact I was functioning quite well by the middle of week 2 and 3 after each FEC treatment.  Unfortunately this has not been the case on Taxotere.  My best functioning days have been the first two days after tx while the Decadron is in my system and the day before the next tx.  Other than that I've been pretty much a \"shut-in\" except for my outing to my family doc last week.....also, not strong enough to handle the stares from people who just don't know or understand :-(((  Glad to hear you tolerated it better after they lowered your dose.  I believe that the docs overseeing me while my onc was absent were afraid to make that exact decision without her weighing in on it.......she has an heir of intimidation about her!!  I will be asking her all kinds of questions tomorrow, without \"challenging\" her of course .  Thanks for your input and hope all is well with you!! Will post after my meeting with my onc tomorrow......thanks again to everybody...................... big HUGS ((( ))) Sandy",

There are different point of views as to when Tamoxifen should start.  My med onc told me I could start it one month after chemo had finished, but my rad onc wanted me to wait until after radiation because of the reaction I was getting over from chemo.  My chemo tx was supposed to be 6 cycles, one every 3 weeks.  The regimen was 3 x FEC, 3 x Taxotere + 1 year of Herceptin.  FEC was manageable but Taxotere really hit me hard.  I had what they call a \"severe toxic reaction\" which worsened after my 2nd Taxotere (5th treatment), and consequently, my 6th/final treatment was cancelled.  I am still getting Herceptin infusions every 3 wks which will continue until May 2010.  It's a long road..........this board has been a huge help in making it a little easier!

NanaA--You are correct, the decision needs to be individual and reflect our own diagnosis, prognosis and situation.  One week after my first Taxotere tx I had a neuropathy in my feet and finger tips and the body/joint pain was extremely bad, so switching from Taxol to Taxotere could have made things even worse for you.  I'm wondering if my onc will try to switch me over to Taxol, in which case I will say \"no nothing from the Taxane family thanks\", just give me the Herceptin.  I will then show her the research article I found from May 2009 on this website, \"Sequential Docetaxel:  No Benefit in Early Breast Cancer\".  It basically states that adding Taxotere to FEC or CMF treatments for early stage bc has shown virtually no improvement on 5 year survival or recurrence rates.  What it did show was that women receiving this drug had a higher risk of serious chemo-related side effects; grade 3 or 4 toxicities.  Again, this pertains to the benefit, or lack thereof, in adding it to adjuvant therapy for early stage bc, NOT its effectiveness in treating advanced or metastatic bc. Lovinmomma--Thanks for your support.....I think they'll be listening now, plus I have lots of pics which will support the progression and why I was calling them in the first place!! Deanna-- Thanks for your support.  I will look for the post you are referring to.  My med onc is the Director of Research at the hospital I'm being treated at, teaches at University of Toronto, and works out of two hospitals (albeit they are side by side), so initially I thought I was in great hands.......turns out her schedule might be a little too busy to be there for her patients' needs and concerns!  I will be questioning her initial lack of concern and I'm hoping her seeing my pictures might make her react quicker with the next poor women who goes through this.  Anyway she seems to be listening now and will acutally see me this Tues.  She has already decided that I will no longer be getting Taxotere, so maybe the chemo part of my tx might be finished .  I can live with that decision!
