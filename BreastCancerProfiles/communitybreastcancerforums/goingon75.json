So ready to have this behind me and have read through all of the posts as a reminder of some of the obstacles that can arise and how to handle them. My surgery is not until tomorrow afternoon so not sure what time I will be joining all of you for that drink. Don't do alcohol so make mine a virgin pina colada. My faith is still stronger than my fear and I refuse to borrow trouble from tomorrow. Can't change anything so I am totally in the hands of the Great Physician.",

Have one more appointment with BS on Thursday, but as of now it will be nipple-saving BMX with TE. Need to discuss the nipple-saving part again with BS as PS was not very encouraging about the position of the nipples after reconstruction. Rather not have save the nipple if they are going to be pointing toward the floor. lol I do not post much on here but I read every word written by you ladies and am appreciate for all you share. Helps so much to gain information from those walking your same path.",

BMX was completed but not able to save nipple. Fine with me. I have not seen doctor yet but he apparently told my daughter they feel they got all the cancer and no sign of it in lymph nodes. Have been up once to go to bathroom and did get very nauseated but that passed. I have two drains that have been emptied once. I have not had anything else for pain but think that is about to change. I am beginning to feel pain when I move. Just looking forward to getting on with my day which includes plans to go home. Learned one thing yesterday from anaesthetiologist. When answering questions in the affirmative, always say yes or correct. Saying \"right\" might result in unwanted results. Praying my surgery partnerso from yesterday are doing well. I will sign off for now and probably not check back in until I am home and enjoying ice cream and coke floats.",

Malignancy in both breasts has been confirmed and surgery is tentatively scheduled for 1/30. Just found this site yesterday and have found it to be very helpful.  Like some of you, I prefer to remain fairly quiet about my diagnosis. My sons and daughter have been my support system and only a couple of friends have been told.  Did not tell my DH until this morning and because of his dementia he may not remember what he was told tomorrow. lol   I know where my ultimate support comes from and I am not worried or overly concerned. However, this site has certainly answered questions and provided information that I did not even know I needed. Your honestly in sharing your experiences, feelings and thoughts and the encouragement for one another is so special. Thank you all for your input. I will continue to follow the progress of all of you as you take this journey.",

Saw a quote on Facebook the day I went for first biopsy that I thought was good and I decided to claim it...\"My faith is greater than my fear.\" Had nothing to do with breast cancer but thought it was good.  Also at the age of 74 (75 in March), I could say I am on borrowed time so this is just a bumpy road on my journey for now.  Do not know how any of you got to this point in your lives that you learned you had breast cancer but I am only here because my insurance company called me last September and asked how long it had been since I had a mammogram and would I like for them to set one up for me.  I have been very negligent in getting mammograms for at least the last 4-5 years so seized the opportunity to take care of it.  Because of that phone call, which I do not believe was coincidence, I am writing in this site tonight.  Were it not for that call, my outcome/prognosis could be totally different.  I do consider myself a young 74 year old and I enjoy life very much. I am so grateful for this site and I hope this experience will provide me with the opportunity to be an encouragement to someone else down the road.  Each one of these ladies is remarkable. We have so much in common making this a place to easily relate our feelings and concerns and get feedback to help us know what we are facing down the road. ",
