I have my port placement tomorrow and I start chemo on 3 Nov.; AC once every 3 weeks for 2 months, then T once a week for 12 weeks. I've never had to take Nuelasta, so time will tell. My sister had been through this in the past and had all three meds at the same time once every 3 weeks for 4 months. I'm curious about the different regimens hhmmmm. I have to say I'm not as nervous or scared now that I have a plan and will be starting it soon. The waiting is the worst!! I haven't given much thought to wigs. My hair is long enough I could have my own wig made with it? I did purchase quite a few beanies and have a few caps and hats. My goal is to go in for chemo, get sick over the weekend, and head back to work Monday. That's best case scenario and with chemo changing to once a week for 12 weeks, I imagine I won't be working as much then. We'll see. I've been thinking about my grandson and how it might be good to have him with me when my sister cuts my hair/shaves my head. My thought is that if he sees this happen then the next time he sees me without any hair it won't be such a shock. Anyone else have the same or similar experience?? And to everyone good luck and well wishes!!",

My MO assured me the percentage of women who actually experience side affects from the adriamycin are very low, and doctors take everything into consideration when determining which type of chemotherapy you'll be having. Stay positive!! :-)  My plumbing has been stopped up for two days. Eating bran cereal, fruit, and water for dinner. It's driving me nuts. Not painful, but consistent in that I sit down and I feel like I could go and as soon as I stand up and move around, I feel great and nothing comes out in the restroom. I'm hoping this dinner helps or I'll have to take something. blah  Javamama, my chemo treatment day and the following day were just fine. I did start to feel symptons on day 3, just nausea and I feel like if I had taken an anti-nausea then and not waited until Monday morning, I would have been fine over the weekend, too. Everybody is different. I hope you and everyone else get to enjoy Thanksgiving!!  Update: Looks like the high fiber dinner worked! Relief! Note to self: Balance meals better!!!!!!  Anyone cramping, yet?? Regardless of how much water you might be drinking? Cramp911. I feel like I should buy stock in this company. I've been using Cramp911 for years.

Most of the nausea hit over the weekend and anti-nausea meds helped during the work week, so that went well. My treatments will be Thursday, hopefully always in the afternoon, and I can flex my work hours to make it fit. I switch to taxol once a week after the new year and will have to wait to see how that goes. I do plan on taking some time off simply because I know it's going to wear me down soon, but maybe not? I'll stay positive, but this is one instance where it is all about me because this is not a silly cold. A funny story - I work in a building that does not allow PDAs, cell phones, and the like, and as I walked into a work space to talk with some coworkers my Nuelasta patch started beeping..... aaaaawkward!!

I had my 5th weekly taxol treatment today. I have been very lucky with taxol. No nausea at all. The only SEs I experience are from the drugs given to me on treatment day and also from a prescription for acid reflux that developed while I was doing AC. Weening myself off of that one now!! I have been experiencing intermittent pains (jaw, neck, lower legs and feet, but they go away as fast as they came. Strange... When all goes well my taxol treatments last two hours. Today I showed up early as directed and wasn't seen by the NP until 30 minutes after my scheduled appointment time. Um, she might have gotten an earful. :-) I hope your taxol treatments go just as smoothly, if not smoother for you!!  amw5, haven't heard from you in a bit, hope all is well!!  Sorella??? You still out there? How are you doing??",

My first port connection hurt, as well, because the steri strips were still on so they had to get through those first, but it shouldn't hurt nearly as much next time. I had a lumpectomy and still have the numbing cream so I'm going to use that next treatment, just in case.  Natster, Prune juice huh? I was able to get myself going with a fiber filled dinner, but will definitely add prune juice to my list of options. Thanks  I had my between treatment blood work visit today and my MO told me the nausea I experienced will be consistent, but it shouldn't get worse, so I was very relieved to hear that.

You'll be amazed at how helpful it can be. You don't have to post very much if you're not comfortable. Just knowing there are so many of us fighting together is a comfort. You're right. Not many on this post have the same pathology. I'm doing AC once very two weeks for two months and then taxol once a week for 12 weeks. Everyone is different. I don't know why chemo before radiation, but am glad you asked because now I'm going to ask my MO. Anyone else have an idea why chemo before radiation?? Also, according to my MO the suggested time frame she was comfortable with between surgery and chemo was 4-6 weeks. Again, everybody is different. Mine was stage 2 but very aggressive. I have had only to deal with nausea for several days (got sick only once because I drank too much water at one time) and anti-nausea meds really help. It's day 10 for me and still have all my hair down to the middle of my back. My sister is ready to cut it and to shave my head, so I'm thinking I'll be doing that next weekend. I hope you fare even better! ",

The side affects are a little too much for me, but the other is Ondansetron, which is working very well. I just hate taking medicine, but realize this is not a situation where stubbornness should play a part. My nausea has not been debilitating, just constant, but also consistently getting better. I took Odan... this morning. I did not take it this afternoon. I've eaten dinner and feel pretty good, and I'm taking advantage of the tips on the website for what to eat and when. I'm really good at over analyzing! :-/ A coworker of mine also suggested ginger chews, so I picked up some today at the nearby MOMs. Glad you're doing better!  Amyemn, sorry if this seems late, but haven't been posting everyday.... I don't know how long you've been married, and I don't know you or your husband, but could it be he simply he is unsure of how to support you since this is something he cannot fix?? You've hear of Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus? Even though it might seem simple or not for him to offer to do a chore or something similar, he might just be feeling overall helpless with your diagnosis. And he's a guy! I don't say that to offend, but they are a different breed. :-) Just food for thought..........  Hi Pink91316, If your doctor hasn't given you any specific instructions, treat it as any other day. My chemo day and the following day were good days. I had a steroid and anti-nausea before the chemo (AC). I also found my self over prepared as far as what I took with me. It just depends on how long you'll be there as to whether you bring a snack, a book, music, etc. I hope it goes well!!  Molly09 - You are truly an inspiration!!  Good luck to you, to all of us November Chemo Warriors!",

Curcumin, the active ingredient in the spice turmeric, is a natural anti-inflammatory that has been shown to ease muscle soreness after a tough workout, stop a headache in its tracks, support weight-loss goals, and improve your digestion.

I didn't need it after the survey so I almost forgot I had it. It's perfect for my need. Amyamn - Not only are we starting chemo on the same day but looks like are regimens are somewhat similar. It's so wonderful to have such great support in this forum and sad at the same time that so many of us are having to go through this. Leslie26 - Wow! Looks like you have quite the road ahead of you, and no one looks forward to chemo. Keep your chin up and try to stay positive. I keep saying to myself,\" if this is the process I need to go through to kill anything left and and to prevent it from coming back? Well, yeah, Bring it On!. Nothing but good thoughts for all of us!! :-)  Patti ",

Saturday and Sunday - very nauseated; ended up taking one of the anti-nausea meds this morning since I got sick last night (too much water). It helped. I'm curious if Neulasta can affect previous injuries. I had a bulging disk and surgery and man! oh man! has that lower back area been bothering me. Since Saturday. Could be just a coincidence and that I tweaked it somehow. I am taking the Claritin. After seeing Nfullblume's post I asked my MO about it because I usually take Benadryl. Taking Claritin helps in more ways than one. :-) How is everyone dealing with the nausea? I found simply not eating helps and I know that is definitely the wrong way to go. Tea and crackers have gone down well. I found that later in the day the worse it is and I've had headaches to varying degrees; although, not life-interfering, since my first treatment. Anyway.....I hope everyone is well!! DBear! That wig suits you! Absolutely lovely!",

I feel like infusion day is one of my best days because I don't feel anything and I have steroids and anti-nausea meds in me. My MO said (other than fatigue) my symptoms should not worsen as treatments go on, and in fact, after my second treatment and managing the expected side affects better, my experience was definitely better the second time around. Always talk to your MO and knowing what you side affects are you may be better able to manage them this next go around. I hope it goes better for you!!",

As for chemo fog I only experienced that after the 1st chemo session and have been pretty good with just constipation after treatments due to anti-nausea meds. I've been very lucky. Although, I got a nasty chest cold I'm having a hard time shaking after going home for Thanksgiving, shopping, going out to eat, going to a movie, etc. I'll be staying close to home and not doing as much for Christmas. I asked my MO about sleeping because I get very little of it and she suggested Tylenol PM, so I'll give it a whirl.",
