Like so many others, I thought that I was so vigilent with mammograms and ultrasounds, but it wasn't enough. So, it scares me that it can sneak up on you. Keep the survivor list coming. It helps me, and I hope that it helps others.",

It goes from top to bottom.  My hand and fingers tingle at times.  I have a port on that side and had a non cancerouse mastetomy on that side.  Does tamoxifen cause this kind of pain?  Can a recurrence cause this kind of pain?  I have had pain for about 3 weeks right after my last 3 month check up.  My blood tests were very good.  Doctor was very happy about my check up.  I just don't know if this is normal.  It seems to slowly be getting better, but it just aches like a growing pain or arthritis.  Any one who has advice, I'd appreciate it.
