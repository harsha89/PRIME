      "Content": "JSG wrote: I was diagnosed in August with Ductile Insitu carcinoma in the left breast, I also had cervical cancer and had to have a full hysterectomy two days after my breast cancer diagnosis.  So I havent had the breast surgery yet.  My physician says the cancer is in multiple locations so wont do a lumpectomy, wants me to go with a Masectomy, which I have scheduled for the 6th, of Oct. Now I am getting cold feet!  Was wondering if anyone has had the same diagnosis and what treatmemt you had?  Can I get away with lumpectomy or is Masectomy my only real option? I am single, but dating, also wondering how partners handle the masectomy or how you tell someone new you meet? Any advice will be appreciated.

Can you tell me how that process was, maybe timeframe from start to finish, and are you happy with the results?  I typically dont scar well, so am concerned with results.    Like your attitude on the dating guys who arnt worth it,  hope I am as good as weeding ou the bad ones as you appear to be.  Happy for you you found one of the good guys! Dont have any invasive as far as I know, type O, thanks for pointing that out, I will edit that.   ",
