So heres my story, I am 22, a nurse, and a mother to a beautiful 4 yr old girl. About a year after I had my daughter I had a mammogram done on my breasts, which showed nothing thato I was told. About a year later I had an incidence with low WBC, was sent to an oncologist who pretty much blew me off. She did one set if labs, in which my WBC did come up, but we're still low. I was told there was no need to come back.was told I was too young to worry about anything. About a year or so I noticed a sore spot at the crease of Mt left breast, which I blew off. Told my obgyn about who also told me it was nothing to worry about. A few months ago I was just doing a quick look in the mirror and noticed a rather large dimple on the lower side of the same breast, which has never been there before. Called my doc and once again was told I was too young, but sent me to have a Mamo done. There, I was also told I was too young, but they did it anyways. Apparently showed nothing. No cysts or anything. My doc called me after she got the results and also once again told me I was too toung, but I still contributed to have breast soreness in that localized area, and the dimpling cont. I feel like I'm not being taken seriously because of my age. My grandmother was diagnosed in her thirties with breast cancer. I'm just worried... ugh. Log in to post a reply",
