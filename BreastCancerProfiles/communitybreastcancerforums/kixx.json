I have a consult with an RO in two weeks and am concerned about radiation damaging my heart. BC is in my left breast. Prone radiation sounds like it might be a better option, but I don't even know where and if it is done in my area (Los Angeles). Since I don't think my hospital offers it, I'm skeptical that the RO would say it's a good idea.",
