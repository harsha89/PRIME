First everyone reacts differently to chemo but most get along pretty well overall.  I worked the whole time, but I don't have a physically challenging job, I don't know what you do.  I had my treatments on Fridays, and on Monday I would work a half day and on Tuesdays I was feeling more back to normal.  The main thing for me with AC was nausea the first night, but the anti-nausea meds really kept it at bay.  You want to take them as directed regardless of how you feel.  I found that as long as you stay ahead of it you do fine. I did gain weight.  I think the pre-meds (steroids) help do that but I also didn't do much in the way of exercise.  Sometimes you just don't feel like it and I think it's good to rest when you're tired going through this.  Many continue with their workouts and don't gain anything, so now I have to get busy getting rid of the weight. On rare occasions I have heard of people not losing their hair, but if I were you I would plan on it and just get yourself mentally prepared.  I lost mine right after my second DD treatment.  I had long hair so I cut it short in preparation.  I also purchased a couple of wigs and some scarfs ahead of time to be ready.  As my hair actually began to come out, I went to a beauty shop and had them use the clippers on it.  Less traumatic and a whole lot less mess. All in all, as you have seen on the boards, the treatments are very doable.  I think we all get ourselves worked up to expect the worst then at least in my case it wasn't as bad as I had myself set up to believe. Stay with this site, there is alot of experience here and you'll find alot of information and tips on getting through all of this.  You will do fine, don't worry about the weight and hair, it doesn't make you shallow to think about those things, just normal.  Those things are just temporary, you can lose the weight if you gain any and your hair will grow back. Take care and best of luck to you in your treatment! Tara",

The AC mostly made me tired and by the time I felt better it was time to do it again so fatigue and just sort of being out of it was why I didn't work out.  I never had the diarrhea problem that others have had, my issues were the opposite.....  Drink lots of water a day or 2 prior to treatments and don't have them on an empty stomach.   Find things that seem to taste good to you and have it on hand and ready so you don't have to go shopping for 2-3 days. I did start to work out more once I started Taxol and Heceptin because I wasn't as out of it with that treatment, but just wasn't real consistent with it and of course that was during the holidays as well :-)   But during that portion is when the weight came on, I think it was the pre-meds and I was doing it every week for 12 weeks.  Towards the end I was gaining like 3 pounds a week and wasn't eating any differently, it just came on. The good thing is this doesn't mean it is going to do the same to you, everyone is different.  I don't know if you will be doing radiation, but between Chemo and radiation we went out of town as well.  And also went again after radiation.  Believe it or not, I think bouncing back from everything made me more tired than I was during treatment.  I was done with Chemo the end of January this year and radiation in April (of course still on Herceptin) and I think I was more drained in May and June than I ever felt.  In July now I am beginning to have more \"normal\" days than wiped out days. I don't know if this happens to others, but a couple of ladies I have talked to experienced the same thing. Tara",
