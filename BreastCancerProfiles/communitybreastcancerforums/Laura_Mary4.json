    "Content": "Laura_Mary4 wrote: hello I'm 22 years old and found a small lump about three weeks ago, after keeping it to myself I finally plucked up the courage to go and see the doctor who sent me off to have a mammogram. That was done last week. I passed out in work yesterday and having been nagged at by the boyfriend I went off to the hospital. Was greeted by the most unhelpful doctor In the world, I explained I was awaiting results and hadn't heard anything back, to be honest I assumed it was all okay, big mistake! He came back with a clip board and said it could be DCIS or LCIS but noone really knows! I'm so confused & feel really alone my boyfriend has gone weird on me and my family have so much issues of their own they don't need me damping the parades. I'm hoping to gain a little bit of help here. Log in to post a reply",
