She's since had a recurrence, after having two daughters, and did follow the onc's advice that time. Important to note that doctors give a prognosis based on their best knowledge at the time. What is not usually factored in are the lifestyle and beliefs of the woman being diagnosed. This woman was twice given what I call a \"Voodoo Verdict,\" meaning \"You only have ___ time left.\" Now they call her \"the Miracle Woman\" because they can't scientifically explain how her deep religious beliefs and prayers have kept her healthy. I know of another woman who refused all medical treatment and is relying on diet, acupuncture, and meditation--I believe she will stay healthy, too. My own beliefs are positive, but not quite that strong, so I did agree to bilateral mastectomy, but I would have been a hard sell for chemo. Blessings to you.",

I have a fan in every room and work from home, so live in tank tops and shorts (in Florida). For the dryness, since I'm estrogen-receptor positive, onc said no Vagifem, and suggested Replens, but I'm trying to eliminate chemicals and Replens has parabens. I've found a great product called Yes -- it's the only natural lubricant I've found that comes in applicators... not cheap, but two applications a week = $20 a month, which is worth it to me, just for comfort.

The score you get predicts your recurrence risk if you were taking Tamoxifen. If you're taking another drug, you just extrapolate... for me, Arimidex reduces the risk a bit more than Tamoxifen.",

I'm sure it's true that for younger, pre-menopausal women it's usually considered safer to go for chemo. Also, the Onco tests are based on women taking Tamoxifen and I'm taking Arimidex, which supposedly has a slighter lower recurrence rate for my type of cancer and age group. According to the onc, my recurrence risk is only 1 in 8, would have been 1 in 4 without Arimidex. I would have been a basket case if chemo were recommended because I want to be focusing on buildling my immune system, not tearing it down. But I would have followed my onc's advice. Tough decisions, each one very personal, and I do believe that our attitude counts. So if someone believes she'll be healthier without chemo, that attitude alone can make a difference.",
