Remember that you are going into this well and strong, and that stregth will help you to deal with what lies ahead.  My suggestion is to listen carefully to what the doctors tell you (and please bring your husband/partner/best friend who is comfortable dealing with doctors), and, as much as you can, review, research, and think about what they suggest before making any decisions. My only regret about my treatment was that I had my lumpectomy done by a local sugeon instead of going to a breast-cancer surgeon at Dana-Farber, where I was subsequently treated. But even that was fine--just something I'd have done differently in restrospect. In any case, for now, please do whatever takes your mind off these worries and take good care of yourself. Play with your boys, cook or bake, sit with your sister or a friend, go to dinner with your husband, ride your motorcycle. There's a wide circle of women here who will reach out with practical advice and loving support when you're ready to tap into it. Sending healing thoughts to you and your family.",

In a screening mammogram, the results are returned within a matter of days. Once you've been diagnosed with and treated for breast cancer, diagnostic mammograms are pretty much the standard--or they are at the center where I'm treated. I know I'm more comfortable getting the results the same day I see my oncologist or nurse practitioner.  On the other hand, my insurance doesn't cover the diagnostic test completely, so I'm now paying a few hundred dollars for what used to be free. Sigh.  And I'd love to hear the story of your name.   Ann",

I can't add much to what's been said here, and I had a different diagnosis/treatment plan. (I will say it's worth trying to hang on to your hair, if you have the resources and energy. Otherwise, you'll get a whole new look when it grows back.) But I do know attitude (yours and those around you) makes a big difference in getting through treatment and adjusting to life afterward. You are tough and strong and have a sense of humor, which believe me is huge in all this. These are hard and scary days, but, as Marie said, you are so not alone.

I totally agree with Titan that you should tell your nurse right away about how your friend died, and that it's making you extremely anxious. I had 12 weekly infusions of Taxol and Herceptin, and the nurses were really terrific--not just mine, who was great, but I saw many, many nurses giving extra attention and spending additional time with patients who were anxious or uncomfortable.  Chemo DOES save lives, and it will greatly improve your chances of living to raise those girls and enjoy them as they grow. This must be just dreadful for you.

I'm nearly four years out from diagnosis. What I can say, at this point, is that recovery time seems to vary greatly, and has a lot to do with your treatment and your reaction to the drugs you were given and the regimen your doctor prescribed. But good nutrition, regular exercise, and support from friends and family make a huge difference. Seeing a naturopathic dr. seems like a great idea. At some point you'll realize that you're not thinking about your health or this frightening disease quite as often as you were. Keep focusing on regaining your good health. Sending best wishes for a smooth and speedy recovery!",
