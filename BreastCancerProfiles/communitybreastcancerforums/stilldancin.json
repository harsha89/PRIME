So, my reason for this topic is...my HAIR is falling out!!!!  This sucks!  I knew it was going to happen but when I saw it...in my hands, on the kitchen counter, on the sofa,...it SUCKS!!!!!! Going scarf shopping tomorrow.  All will be good.  I have a very good friend who just went through chemo for ovarian cancer.  Her words...bald is beautiful.  I have also heard bald is the badge of strength.  I LOVE THIS!!!!  Makes me strong.  I have been positive since day one and want to keep it up!!!  To all those feeling the way I do, going through the same crap...email me.  I would love to hear from you!!!  Hair today, actually scarf shopping tomorrow and then gone the next day.  LIFE IS GOOD!!!
