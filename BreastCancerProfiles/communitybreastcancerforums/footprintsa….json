I went to a place to cool down, The city put it up cause of the heat and I was on TV in my wheelchair talking about the heat and lymphedema. I also told her there is not enough help at Dr for lymphedema Then showed her my holes in my gloves. I might not see anything, But at least I let them know we need to be heard. Thanks Again Debbie",
