Plus, it's not a onco's protocol in Malaysia. To onco, a person is required to do chemo even if one lymph node involved. I guess that it may be due to that onco type dx is not covered by insurance and MYR14K is a huge amount to many ppl.  ",

Wondering why chemo done before lump (unless I've been misled). I'm going to start chemo on 30 Jan but BS in his opinion suggesting to do Onco type dx and based on the data, he said chemo may not benefit me. My lump is 1.2 cm. Oncologist thinks otherwise. Logic thinking is to do chemo as it outweighs the risk.   ",

My BS removed 2 lymph nodes and found my sentinel node was positive and the other node was negative. However, for precaution reason, he removed another 16 nodes during the surgery and they were tested negative. The side effect after then is manageable although numbness till now but I can move my hand here and there. I guess that so long I continue doing exercise, it would be fine.  ",

My BS said I may not require to take the chemo as my tumor size is small 1.2 cm and 10mm of sentinel of node is involved.The rest of 17 nodes are free. I'm er/pr + and Her2-. He suggested to take zoladex and tamoxifen instead. However onco said even though is 1 lymph node, it is advisable to take chemo. I understand. After my first chemo yesterday, I asked onco..how do I know if TAC chemo can kill the hidden cells in my blood stream. Is there any marker or evidence to support this since I had already done lumpec. I'm not able to see the shrinkage tumor size. There are so many drugs in the market like FEC or TAX. The onc said TAC works 90% on people. What if I fall on the 10% group ? Then, he said it is better to take the 90% effectiveness. Has anyone asked the same question before ? Many thanks.

My onco in Malaysia suggested for chemo based on the std protocol however my breast surgeon suggested to do onco type dx in view of the small tumour size and 1 lymph node involvement. He also suggested to use Zoladex injection for 2 years plus Tamoxifen for 5 years instead on chemo. As onco type dx is not covered under my insurance, I will have to pay MYR14k to know if the chemo benefits me. My objective is to get the best treatment and to minimise the side effect of the chemo which I heard it will damage other internal organ. I'm confuse. Please share your opinion.
