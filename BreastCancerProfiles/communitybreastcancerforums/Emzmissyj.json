Tissue which is hard, very moveable and tender, all 7 doctors told me there is nothing to worrie about but the 7th doctor has referred me for peace of mind. They all said no lump and nothing there that's concerning. Also I have on and off pain in the right shoulder and ribs which is mild and not got any worse. Sometimes I get pain in the breast and front of ribs which is also on and off and somedays I don't even notice these pains. I'm 24 and realise I may be overreacting as I've seen so many doctors. Breast tenderness has subsided a little and I'm due on my period in a few days. Any chance this could be fibrosis breast tissue coursing this? My dads mum had breast cancer and beat it so I found out, but the doctor said that doesn't increase my risk of getting it! Advice anyone? Log in to post a reply",

I have had physical breast examinations and all clear I'm due for a ultrasound in the coming weeks. I've been told breast cancer doesn't always present a lump sometimes skin changes ect can happen. I've had no changed to the breast at all and it's a month later. Left breast is lumpy as well. All that runs through my head is I have bc and it's spread, I do suffer with anxiety. I don't always notice the pain as its not constant.",
