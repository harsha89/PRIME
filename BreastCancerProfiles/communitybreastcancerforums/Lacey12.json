I had always thought that it would be terrible to hear a cancer dx over the phone. However, after a routine mammo and then a quick US (I had needed this area looked at more closely before, so I wasn't alarmed), the radiologist asked if I could stay to have a needle biopsy of the dense area she was looking at. Then I was alarmed. Obviously I was not about to leave the Center! Afterwards she told me that I should call for the results the next day, then apologized, saying that she would be post-call thus unavailable and she wanted me to meet the radiologist who I would be calling for the results. I was glad to meet the person who would be giving me the news. I called the next day, and she told me that I had IDC, and that I \"was going to be fine\"...would need to meet with the surgeon... and gave me the info for the nurse navigator I needed to contact in the Breast Center to get the appts. and treatment process rolling. She had also said that I could get a second opinion, and they would facilitate that if I felt I wanted to go that route (I live in an area lousey with excellent medical centers). I didn't get a second opinion. I did call a friend who is a nurse manager in my PCP's office at the same hospital and got referrals to a great treatment team who it turns out has also treated some other women I know. Had lumpectomy two weeks later, second margin clearing surgery two weeks after that, no chemo since my oncotype was a 4, and just finished 33 rads treatments...25 whole breast and 8 boosts to the cavity site. Through this entire process I felt a certain sense of calm because of the way the radiologist said I was \"going to be fine\" when she gave me the initial dx. Later, I recall thinking \"this was handled over the phone and it was okay\". I knew that the possibility of a cancer dx existed, so it wasn't a \"cold call\". I appreciated that there was a considerate plan for how the information would be shared with me and the phone issue became a non-issue. I hope that the sharing of diagnostic info goes as well for you. Good luck!",
