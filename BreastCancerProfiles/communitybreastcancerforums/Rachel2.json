I was worried about how radiation would affect my skin since I have red hair and am fairskinned and asked the radiation therapist.  She said there is no connection between skin type and how it affects you but I find that hard to believe so we shall see.  ",

I get a mammogram in October and see my oncologist in September.  Then its a mammogram every year and a 6 month check up with the GP for the next 5 years I think. I asked my oncologist if I now look for symptoms of metasis and she said no just live your life.  Easy to say harder to do.  She said keep exercizing and eating a low fat diet and now I could start with more antioxidants.  Is anyone taking any supplements besides vitamins?  I take multi vitamin, vitamin D, complex B and a calcium.  I try to eat blueberries everyday, as well as broccoli kale et cetera. ",

I must say the radiation staff are wonderful.  I am in and out in less than 20 minutes.  Sammolisa you are getting a lymphadema sleeve and glove because of symptoms or just precautions (perhaps I missed a posting).  I have pain in my lower right arm which is the same arm where the lymph nodes were removed (4), but I think it is probably more associated with my hand pain.  I see my regular oncologist May 9th so will ask her then. ",

I lost my car keys last week...not sure if it is chemo brain or chemopause brain, but they still haven't surfaced.   My only complaint is that I am tired and actually fell asleep Sunday afternoon for 2 hours which is so unusual for me.  My skin feels a little sensitive but none of the issues that some others are experiencing ie: blisters, swelling.  Maybe that will come...   One strange thing that is happening is that my eye lashes are already growing back and they are coming in black.  They are usually white due to my coloring.  I thought they took a long time to come back?  The hair on my head is slowly coming back and my girls tell me the top feels like a baby chicks down its so soft.  Can't tell what color it is as it seems to be coming in black, but I am fairskinned and used to be a redhead.  Hope everyone has an ok day. ",

So far no issues, and everyone is so nice and friendly.  I find radiation a bit scarey because at least with chemo you can see what is going into your body and why you don't feel good.  With radiation, you can't see anything and that is the eery thing for me.   Take care everyone. ",
