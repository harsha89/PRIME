I am taking short term disability for the duration of the treatments which officially begin Thurs. The rad people act like it should not interfere with work but my company is great and is OK with the break. As a sales rep in the pharmaceutical world, I have a lot of meetings, lunches, travel,etc. and I know I am not at my best right now.  That is the bad thing about sales, you really need to be on with your customers, they really are not there for you.  Also, I am so much older (50) than my sales team, I just struggle with having everyone in my business. I think the break will help me get a better mindset.  I just hope this is the right decision...

I will miss it but dont want to add more discomfort. I must be destined to be fat!  ",
