I thought my implant had ruptured or something so i was trying to wait through the weekend to be seen by my dr. well the swelling and pain got so bad so fast i went to the er and they did ultrasound and found nothing. they checked for rupture but nothing, next thing was infection but again they found nothing. the dr asked me if i had pain in that breast before or if i had any lumps and i said no to the lumps and yes to minor pain that i thought was caused by my implants. they told me to follow up with a bc dr and if my problems got any worse to return to the er. the next day the pain had spread to my chest but only on the right side, at that moment i did a self breast exam and thats when i found the lump in my under arm. the same day i had the bloody discharge again but i knew the er wouldnt be able to do anything for me other than give me pain meds so i just waited. by monday morning  the pain was in my breast, chest, and into my right arm so i immediatly contacted my dr. i have a mamo at 745 am may 24th. my dr told me to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.  he said that all of my symptoms lean more toward bc than anything else. he did do bloodwork and stared antibiotics just in case of infection but i know my body and i know that something is seriously wrong. and to add to all of this, in the process my implant has completely shifted leaving me with two very crooked breast. not really a big deal but i cant wear a bra because of swelling and the pain. this is just unlike anything i have ever experienced. i feel like i have no control anymore. anything would help at this point because im so afraid that if this test is positive that i may have ignored the signs for so long that it may be too late. thank you so much Log in to post a reply",
