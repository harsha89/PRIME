      "Content": "Sep 13, 2012 11:18AM clairejslm wrote: 1. You are a widow, and then became a nun. How did this happen, can you describe it? It's very difficult to describe. It's like trying to describe how you fell in love. I was a young widow (28) and didn't become a nun until I was in my 40s, so it wasn't a quick transition at all. It started as an intellectual interest (I did my doctorate on a related topic) and slowly moved from my head down to my heart. It wasn't easy, and my first try lasted about nine months before I ran away - literally, with the clothes on my back! (I didn't have to run away, of course. I just freaked out.) A few years later, when I had a successful business, the call to go back became irresistible - and this time it took. 2. You are a nun with breast cancer. Do you find that you are treated any differently by medical professionals?  Well, I live in Israel, on the Jewish side of Jerusalem. Many, many people here have never knowingly spoken to a Christian and there are a lot of funny ideas going around. I'm a very friendly and communicative person, so people approach me with questions pretty often. Medical professionals are no exception. Aside from that sort of question, though, I think I had exactly the same treatment as anyone else. The nurse who took out the stitches after my mastectomy, way back at the beginning, said while she was removing the sutures, \"You are God's friend. You have given your life to him, you live for him, to do his will? Why did God do this to you?\" A really great question! It led me to do a lot of meditating, thinking, reading, praying, discussing, and eventually to publish and go on television to talk about that issue and how I deal with it.  3. What has been your cancer diagnosis/treatment from start to finish? That is still really traumatic for me, and I'm going through a terrible time right now, so I'd rather not discuss it. The finish? I have metastatic breast cancer, sugar. The finish will be the same for me as for everyone else on this board.  4. If you could accomplish one thing before you die, what would it be? Only one? That is terribly tough. If we take world peace and ending hunger and child mortality and all that out of the equation, I assume, right? I'm going to go for one personal thing and one public thing. Because I am self-willed and bossy and break rules sometimes. ;) The personal thing that I dearly hope to accomplish is to reconcile with my brother and to help him find peace within himself. The public thing that I'd like to accomplish would be to establish a Women's Center in the Christian Quarter of the Old City, a place where women could complete their education, learn skills, make contact and gain the empowerment to take charge of their own lives.  5. You rarely mention God in the posts I've read from you, yet he is clearly pretty important as you married him. Why is this? Living in Israel I've gotten into the habit of not being the one to initiate conversation about God - that's part of it. Another part of it is that my relationship with God is the most intimate part of my life. It's not something that I take out and show to people  easily. On the other hand, I am always happy to talk about God, Scripture, faith groups if asked... It's an intellectual interest, too. And, there is a 6th bonus question: 6. Is there anything else you'd like us to know about you? I'm always open to talk about pretty much anything. PM me or something. I have a blog that you're invited to visit at tellingknots.wordpress.com. It's about all facets of my life, not just my walk with cancer. Hobbies? I make bobbin lace, but haven't been able to lately because of a tremor in my hands, and I knit, crochet and tat, too. Professionally? I used to be a nurse and was a psychiatric nurse practitioner in the US before I came here. Since I've been here I've taught and done office work, but mostly been a translator. Also, I really like anchovies on my pizza and my guilty pleasure is American fast food. :)",

I was diagnosed at Stage III eight years ago, and a few years later developed mets to my spine. A couple of weeks ago mets were diagnosed on both sides of my skull, and at my sternoclavicular joint, too. The mets to my skull has been devastating to me. It somehow is so much scarier than the mets to my spine. I know that skull mets does not spread (of itself) to the brain, but there is something very freaky about knowing the cancer is in my head. They are lytic lesions; I don't feel any bumps. This feels so much more \"advanced\". I find that I'm thinking about who will help me as I become weaker (I live alone), about hospice care, about advance directives. All this, even though I am no weaker or frailer than I was a month ago or a year ago. I don't know if it's appropriate for this forum, and I apologize if it's not, but I'd be very grateful for emotional support or contact from others who have been through this. Thank you.

It is so good to know that others have had the same feelings as I do.  Mammalou, I don't know the general answer to your question. In my case, the mets in my skull are lytic lesions, meaning they cause the bone to resorb instead of creating growths. (In other words, holes in my head!) Lytic lesions do not show up on a bone scan. Mine were found on a head CT that we did to see if I had brain mets.  ",

You took tender, loving care of her and the cancer took her because at a certain point that's what cancer does. It has nothing to do with you. Nothing! You have the most precious memento of your mother in your heart. That will always be there. It will never disappear. You can return to that memory again and again and again.

Only you can decide how to handle it, but if you're already in counseling that is a great place to discuss all the issues attached to your husband's behavior in the past and what will be different from now on - unless he just wants your \"blessing\" for it. Lots of people do accept porn and strip clubs and lots of people don't. Each person has to decide for herself, and each couple has to decide what their boundaries will be.
