Not sure exactly what stage..She started out with neoadjuvant chemo of taxol and something else and finished her 4th dose recently. However, she has noticed a swollen lymph node by her ear right after a 5 hour flight(which idk if it had anything to do w it).... This is freaking me out. My question is, can bc still spread even though you are on high dose chemo sessions? I'm really worried and too impatient to wait for her to get tested... Thanks ladies. Log in to post a reply",
