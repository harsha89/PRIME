Keep celebrating, Melinda, and rock those knockers! :)",

My biggest thing was (is) that my armpit feels like it's on fire. I keep checking the area to see if there is razor burn or sunburn or something there, and the stinging sensation sometimes goes down the back of my arm. The BS said it's the nerves waking up from the surgery and that it will go away. The PS said something very similar. I see you had 13 nodes removed, so it makes sense that the nerves have been somewhat traumatized. Like ChiSandy said, maybe your BS can give you something to help. I'm sorry you have this on both sides at the same time right now, too. Hang in there! Hopefully this is the worst of it!",

I don't have statistics for you, but please remember that people who have complications are much more likely to post here for support than people who don't. You're seeing a skewed sample. I had a left mastectomy with tissue expander placement a couple weeks ago, and the days leading up to it were worse than the day of surgery! I was so scared and then so relieved when I woke up and it was over. I know it's still early, but I did not have any immediate complications. I'm now in the limbo of not knowing my post-surgery treatment plan, and that is more distressing to me than the surgery recovery. I know I only had one versus your double MX, but I hope it's helpful to hear that surgery went smoothly for me. As for making your decisions, I think we all struggle with that. I was afraid of frustrating my BS with my indecision about some surgery aspects, and she said that my only wrong choice would be to ignore the problem. That breast cancer treatment is full of complicated, difficult choices, and we do the best we can. Best wishes to you, and I'll be thinking of you as you get to Wednesday. Kat",

Thank you so much for sharing. I'm nervous about messing up something inside, even if it's just the tissue expander, but I think it'll be fine, too. Already the fluid is a little more see-through again, so it's not all blood, and the breast area itself looks okay. Just getting more sore now. Thanks for the hug, Denise! It's been a crummy day, so we'll start over tomorrow. :) The PS office said to call back overnight if the area swells up twice as large, and if the drain flow is 2 or 3x as much. It's not anywhere near that! So I feel reassured.",

The drain fluid had turned a tan/translucent color, and I was hoping today would be the day the volume would drop below that magic number to get it out. Unfortunately this afternoon I fell down 3 stairs inside my home and without thinking grabbed the railing with my surgery-side arm. As I fell, my arm was pulled straight up and behind my head, sharply stretching everything. It doesn't hurt any more than usual now a few hours later, but the drain picked up in volume, and the fluid turned bright red. I think it has stopped actively bleeding, and I didn't even empty it yet, so it's not a LOT. But seeing the blood worries me, and ugggghhhh, I just wanted to get the drain out soon. I have a message in to the PS office, but I was wondering if anyone here had anything similar happen. If so, how did it turn out for you? Thanks.
