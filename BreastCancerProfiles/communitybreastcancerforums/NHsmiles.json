When someone shaves there head to suppot BC it truly means nothing to me, absolutely nothing. Hairloss during treatment was the most degrading experience for me. Hugs, Heather ",

I was on Percocet for weeks and needed quite a bit of help. I could not reach out and grab a cup of water when I woke up from surgery, and morphine did not touch the pain. Discuss pain options with your doctor so you both are prepared should you need it. I have always been very sensitive in the chest area anybe that had something to do with it.  Xanax was my best friend.  I took one before every surgical procedure, scan, chemo, etc...it took the edge off for me. I have been cancer free since surgery, and my tumor was not small. Chin up and stay positive!!!!  Try not to worry about everything at once. Take it one day at a time, that is how I got througheverything.  Hugs, Heather ",
