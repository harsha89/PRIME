I would appreciate hearing from those women who have been through this.  She and my brother feel like they have been hit with a wrecking ball which is normal (I am a 2x survivor having been diagnosed the 1st time when I was not much older than my sister in law). She is currently undergoing treatment at Hopkins so she is at a great center.  Thanks ladies. Petesmom Log in to post a reply",
