    "Content": "MySheriAmore wrote: I've got open sore that's about the size of a quarter underneath my left breast with \"some\" burning pain and little bit on the sore area & I've had it for about 2 months. I keep putting Neosporin or cortisone cream on it with no signs of healing. Also before that, sometime in the past year, I had an episode of very painful, swollen Lymph nodes under my left armpit, which went away with antibiotics. Then after that was completely gone (a couple months ago) this sore showed up after a bout with a rash under my breasts from sweating & when I got the rash to go away this was still there and it's been there ever since. I know that I need to see a doctor & I already have an appointment with my GP/Pain Doctor in 2 weeks for my monthly pain check-up (which is unrelated to the sore), but it is a 2 hour drive for us to get there & I wondered if it would be alright to wait until then or should I go to an urgent care facility? What would you all do?? Does it sound like a breast cancer symptom? Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
