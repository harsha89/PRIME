Things I've found odd - the taste of the salene...  that's the only thing I can taste/smell during treatment.  It's a flowery funny taste.",

For all you talking about bone pain and Claratin - I had bone pain on days 14-16.  I took Claratin-D (5mg) and it worked for only 4 hours.  It got me wondering if it needed to be -D (pseudoephedrine) or if it's the loratadine that supposedly works.  Even though Claratin is labeled as one tablet every 24 hours, my allergist says you can take up to 10 a day with no problem.  So - to test my theory I switched to a different tablet (Loratadine 10mg) - that worked for me for 3 hours.  I thought, \"this is a pain taking this so often\".  So, I called the Onc office.  They said, \"skip that and use tyleonl or advil\".  My platelet count isn't low so I took advil standard dose and it worked fine for 12 hours.  No more messing around with Claratin for me, but interesting to know that it has some analgesic effects.",

Thanks everyone for taking the time to read my post and respond.  I look forward to communicating with you all throughout this crazy experience!",

If disease is found at other sites, treating it earlier does not improve outcomes, and in fact, finding disease elsewhere would make the stage of disease Stage IV metastatic disease and no longer curable. So yes this is standard practice not to do extensive tests like this.  Still seems like an odd answer to me - basically, if you find something it would change it to stage IV so therefore we don't check in order to keep it at stage II.   And, the words like \"almost never found\"....    I see my MO again next week before treatment.  I'll discuss it more with him then.",
