It isn't pain, just awareness like I can feel it penetrating my skin. I had a ALND and feeling is starting to return! I asked the radiation techs if it was possible that I could feel the rads. They looked at me like I was crazy, but I am not!ðŸ˜²",

I have always colored my hair, so it grew back gray and very white in front. I was wondering what coloring options everyone chose. Have been looking at organic hair color, but not sure how effective it is. I just want to look in the mirror and see me, not the cancer girl of the past 7 months! ",
