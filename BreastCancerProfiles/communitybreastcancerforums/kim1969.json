Found the lump myself.  Since I am pregnant, everyone told me that it was certain to be just a clogged milk duct and it would be fine because the breast do crazy things while pregnant. 2. Measures about 3 cm at about 12 o'clock right under the skin.  Hard as a rock and doesn't move. 3.  2 of my mother's sisters (maternal aunts) had bc - both survivors.  One had a reoccurance but both are fine.",
