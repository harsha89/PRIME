She is up to 300 to 350 mg of oral morphine a day and still can't move without pain. When it was biopsied it was 2 cm, now it looks like about 7cm, causing terrible pain, its under her arm. Her breast is getting bigger and causing terrible pain from the sagging of all the weight on the nerves. She has to go to sleep holding her breast up, thats if she can sleep. She can't wear a bra cause that rubs right against the tumor. I was wondering if there was such a thing as a stick on cup, or something. I can't believe they can't take it out. They operate on brain mets, but can't take this out, seems crazy to me. I understand if they operate it might spread, but what do they do, just let it grow! This is all so crazy!!!

Her surgeon just passed her on to the oncologist after diagnosis. He did two treatments and said it wasn't working (just 2 infusions). Then he passed her on to radiologist. He starts radiation today. Also they both passed her on to cancer hospital in detroit for a phase 1 trial. She never told them that she wanted this, but detroit called to make a july 16th appointment. She mentioned surgery to everyone, first surgeon said oncologist has to decide. Oncologist said no, involves too much stuff now. The tumor underarm goes in toward chest wall, then another tumor starts at chest wall between ribs, and pushing on lung. She just wants one underarm out for now. She also has 3 spots on spine and iliac bone. Liver showed spot after 1st chemo and when she received a mri in emergency room after going in for pnemonia. Last week radiologist said he didnt think spot on liver was anything. Eailer medical oncologist said we think so when I asked if spot on liver was cancer.

Dreamwriter thanks for filling me in, I'm not sure, I hope so, but the nurse made that comment about putting in that advocate paper, and we had it filled out anyway last time she was in the hospital, but just never turned it in. They just give you that when you get omitted. I always thought hospice was like when my mom was bed ridden in 06 with lung cancer, they came in when she was pretty much bed ridden, for her last week, they would just basically come in to check on her and wash her and stuff, my brother and his wife took care of her. Chris told that pain management dr. she has people she can call. I think he said that( about hospice ) when she told him I will be going back to work monday. I was laid off for 3 weeks. I have some questions if anybody can answer them. I called another hospital in the area a couple days ago and asked about getting a second opinion. The woman gave me some names of oncologists that are affiliated with that hospital. I called one and asked if we can meet with the dr. and she said we had to have a dr's referal. I always kept asking Chris if she wanted a second opinion, she would always get mad at me for second guessing her dr.s, I just had a bad feeling. She said she had faith in her drs. and when I would keep asking her it would get her mad cause then she would start to second guess them, and she didnt want to , I guess. She is the type that believes if you say something bad it may get back to them and she didnt want her care to be comprimised. She gave me the analage of if you say something bad about someone at a fast food place or make trouble they can spit on your hamburger! Oh Boy, anyway, her family dr. is affiliated with the hospital she is in now, so I don't think she would ask that dr. in fear it would get back to him. I know, so what, is what I think, but anyway, are there some dr's that do self referals, and being a later stage cancer would they take her. I still am thinking of writing to the senators, and asking them to send an avocate to look over her care given. Then I was thinking should I take her back to a breast dr.,  I know one in town that is affileated with this other hospital that I wanted her to check out a while ago, cause I think its a nonprofit hospital and they wouldn't be so scared about losing money, if thats the case now. When do drs. usually give up on someone? I thought only after all drugs are tried. She is tough. I talked to her after I got home but she was pretty groggy and  falling to sleep when I was talking to her but she said her dr. came in after I left and I didn't quite understand what she was saying. She said he said something about that detroit hospital. Thats another thing that makes me mad, he always comes in late in the evening ,to the hospital, when she is half asleep and I know she wont remember a thing he said. SORRY getting off into babble land!  Well thanks this helps me when I write stuff, Im not much for talking things out ,so my whole life writing stuff down helped me. Oh another thing tomorrow is his hospital day all day, so I am gonna try and get there early. I am gonna ask him, if Chris doesnt want to do tril are you gonna put her on chemo? Chris has the feeling he's washing his hands of her, she's over his head. OK now I can try and get some sleep. Thanks to anyone that tried to understand my babble and may you all have a wonderful day tomorrow. Sorry this stuff is starting to sound like a journal, or diary ! Cyn THANKYOU JENNIFER",

Second chemo had temp 6 days after chemo with temp, and infection I guess but nobody knew what from. They did tests on pic line etc. all tests were negative. They did spinal menagitis test negative. She had low blood counts after in hospital a couple days. First day at emergency room they said counts were good. All tests negative. Visiting dr. over weekend said not uncommon for blood counts to go down with chemo. So Chris was let out yesterday after 5 days in hospital. Today at onc. dr. app. her onc measured tumor under arm with calipers and said alittle bigger and basically sorry tumor treatment not working. He said I can send you to radiation guy for tumor under arm and then take chemo pill xlodia( I think) and 5fu ( Which Chris says is 5 F.. yous). Anyway rad is just to relieve some pain, just on tumor under arm. Which she said ok. He said she could do either first, pill or rad. She told him she's not gonna roll over and die, and she thinks, and I got impression he's giving up  Again when making app. for rad he said sorry tumor therapy isn't working. I can't believe after 2 chemos if it grows alittle its considered not working. What should she do. Does she need another referral to a onclogist? or can she get in by just calling another oncologist. She feels her oncologist isn't giving her a fighting chance, Thanks. Cyn Log in to post a reply",

The pain management Dr. came in and put her on the fentanal patch. I been here most of the day and havent seen any other dr.s . I wanted to ask how her blood tests looked from last night. The pain Dr. asked if Chris thought about hospice. Chris said Damn I'm not a invalid yet! I just have pain ! She is getting around good, her brain is working good, her oxygen level last night in ER was 95% which is good. So this really scares me, as to why they would ask. I asked the RN if she could be a witness to Chris's hospital advocate form, she said no. As I was leaving she said yeah you should get that in you'll probably need it soon. I said oh really, she's been in pain for quite a while. So does she know when Chris is gonna be out of her mind, not being able to make decisions. One good thing is they took her today for her rad treatment, so she didnt miss that. The only thing was the hospice thing that made me sick. My sister worked for home care agency and she said people would get hospice, and would be good and getting hospice for years, in some cases. I know things are changing in her body, but I don't see changes in her thoughts or actions. Other than pain seems worse this week, but then the pain dr. said often rads hurt at first before pain gets better with rads. Oh and she didnt get that spot on her tumor lanced.  I think her breast nonsurgeon was called. So if it wasnt suppose to be lanced Im glad ER Dr. didnt do it without consulting someone. Well I better go home, Cyn",

He mumbled something like well it progressed. He told Chris after the 1st chemo he didn't know that tumors got a little bigger inbetween 1st mri april 22nd and 1st chemo aprox. may23rd, or if they got a little bigger after 1st chemo treatment. He also said 1 tiny spot on liver after 1st chemo.  The funny thing is I seen Chris's back several times and never seen any tumor bulges what so ever. This last time in hospital he was measuring something on her back, I said what? she didn't know. Then he came back a few days later and looked at her back. He said it's gone, he said he measued a tumor there. We just looked at each other and rolled our eyes. If thats the case then why isn't chemo working if he thought she had a bulge on her back. I told Chris he was probably measuring some body fat or muscle.   I just want to know, do we have to go thru the referal process or can we just call other oncologists? Thanks and GOD BLESS ALL, Cyn",

Chris has the tumor under her arm pit that they want to do rads on to relieve the pain, but I didn't state ealier she has a tumor between her ribs and lung, left side. Also he said small spot on liver but liver functions are good. She doesn't know if radiating under arm pit tumor and letting others go untreated until radiation done is good idea or not. Cyn",

Surgeon said it was tumor starting to break thru skin. Its a one inch raised area on top of the main tumor. The surgeon also got a ear full from Chris about her feeling she was just being passed around. Surgeon said she was willing to do surgery in april but the oncologist said no hit it with chemo first. He gave her 2 infusions and said it wasnt working and passed her on to the radiologist for pallitive pain radiation. Then they want to send her to detroit to karmonos for phase 1 tril. I told surgeon it doesnt make sense to me. Two infusions, said its not working, then send her for trials that also arent proven to work. I made statement that maybe the Dr. is getting pressure from medicaid. The surgeon started to say something then stopped. I said what, The surgeon was reluctent to say anything, but then the surgeon said, no not medicaid, but maybe the hospital, since on medicaid, the hospital gets paid 27000.00 for a 60000.00 infusion! The surgeon said its sad , but those things happen. SO BASICALLY DIE,WE ARE GONNA LOSE MONEY!! The surgeon said I still will do pallitive surgery, she looked at tumor, and said dont know if now can do it. Its 12cm, wrapping around to the back. The surgeon said to get back on chemo. A friend said to call  MichiganSenator Carl Levin and demand answers, and a invesigation as to why no one is sticking to the protacol of chemo (more than 2 infusion) regiment. He said to also tell them that Chris health care is being comprimised because of medicaid. Thanks for listening, Cyn",
