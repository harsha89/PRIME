It is very true that the entire staff treats patients and their caregivers wonderfully - they do roll out the red carpet.  The food is wonderful, the complementary medicine part is an awesome feature. They were much more thorough than my local center as far as testing/scans.  BUT -  I found the actual medical care was pretty standard protocol - if you are looking for state of the art or something \"different\", I did not find that there. The worst part of the whole experience - although they took my \"out of network\" insurance, they were EXTREMELY deceptive about what my out of pocket costs would be. Of course, I never got the first bill until well into treatment and yeeouch! The numbers they  quoted at the beginning were completely bogus. After the fact, when you approach them, they pull out all kinds of policies, excuses etc.    Horrible. I have seen others on the internet complaining about this \"financial counseling\" scam that they do on your first day.   PANTS ON FIRE! ",

We are each trying to do what we feel is best.   I don't know if chemo can save my life - I frankly doubt it.  But  I DO that  know chemo saved my breast. (at least temporarily.)   My large tumor  shrunk enough so I could opt for a lumpectomy instead of mx.   I hate every second of chemo and wouldn't wish it on or recommend to anyone.

Chances are they don't all have the same cause. Another explanaton  for why they can't nail down \"the\" cause for bc is because it might have several triggers - like a slot machine - one cherry won't do it, nor two, but 3 cherries and there you go. So who knows? Wearing a restrictive bra plus living near a pvc plant plus eating bologna might be a ticket to join this club.    So what f there are no studies that prove bras are causative?  That also means there are no studies that prove bras are safe.  After years of hearing there were no links at all to antiperspirant- suddenly now there is a study that there may be some cause for concern, after all:  http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/155599.php I agree with the OP that studies are too limited. While they might not all be about new drugs, the majority have some kind of  profit motive.  Likewise, a hypothethis that might HURT profits languishes.  Example - there are MANY proven carcinogenic chemicals - how many studies are going on to nail down which of those might be linked to bc?     ",

I am one of those women who has to try on 20 bras before I find one that fits even half way decently. The problem is not how tight it is under the breast.  Rather, improper placement of the cup constricts the part of my breast that extends under my arm. (I know bras are designed this way on purpose in order to push everything to the front).  The pressure in that area is worse if the bra has wires, but I rarely wore one of those -they were intolerable.    That area exactly  corresponds to the place that my tumor formed. (upper outer quandrant and axilla.)  There are also studies that have found  chronic inflammation is associated with cancer.   The differences in our  breast and lymph node anatomy could readily explain why some might develop bra related cancer, and some not.  That adds up to some pretty compelling circumstantial evidence  - certainly enough to warrant more study, IMO. ",

I have been making calendula tea and putting on as a compress or sometimes mixing with aloe gel so I could apply and then get dressed.  I was hoping to find something easier, but if the creams are so low % wise, I guess I'll just keep making tea.  I went to health food store that sells loose herbs in bulk. I bought  .06 of a pound for 2.40, and it's lasting a LONG time.   In the am, I put a small pot of water to boil, then shut it off and add a handful of calendula petals.  (I also add a handful comfrey. I bought .06 of that for 1.40.)   I let it steep all morning, while I go to my rads appointment. 've been making enough tea for 2 compresses - I put half in the fridge and use half right away. Around noon, I strain it, soak some up in a soft cloth, and put it on my breast as a compress.  My house is kind of cold, so some days I fill the tub and soak in there (breast and compress above the water, the rest of me warming up under the water).   When I get out of the tub, I apply the My Girl's cream and get dressed.   I do the tea every other day. On off days, I use a diluted apple cider vinegar compress - same routine.  I am having some internal pain, but  so far, almost zero redness.   The doc did say that accelerated tx means the side effects tend to show up in the 2 weeks AFTER, so we'll see how that goes. She told me I was originally getting a dose of 188, but it was increased to 260.  I was wondering how that compares to the dose others are getting? ",

As for the antioxidants - I also was told by one doctor to stay off of these supplements. This same doctor has in the past  told me that supplements do nothing and are a waste of money.... Roll eyes.  I'm taking my supplements on the weekends during rads - Fri, Sat, and Sun nights.  Toward the end of treatment, I'll increase it  back to daily.  I figure that at that point, my good cells will need all the help they can get.  ",

Black and blue is fading, red is fading, spots are going away. The internal pains have stopped. Fatigue has been manageable.

I wore a silk undershirt and no bra from the beginning of rads.  I don't know if that was what did it, but usually my skin is ultra sensitive, so no way that I expected such limited burning. ) I am so hopeful that this is not a fluke!  Wishing the best to you all, I will be sticking around to report and let you know how things go -  I am hopeful that these results will be typical for all of us - EZ!   Cheers.",

It almost feels strange the first day you don't have to go back for treatment!   I feel a little better hearing that others have the black spot.  I had never heard it mentioned and thought maybe I was over cooked because of the higher dose when I asked to speed things up. Yikes, that came out wrong! I'm not glad you have one, too, I'm just relieved to know it's not unusual.  I am sad to report that the doc was wrong (surprise) when she told me SE's would peak at about 5 days after the last treatment.  I was fine until day 12, when all hell broke loose.  Out of the blue my skin under the arm ripped open - it looks like someone slashed me a few times with a knife, and then the skin spread apart about 1\" or maybe more. Soooo creepy looking!  It was weird. That morning, my dogs came up on the bed to greet me, as is our usual ritual. Every single one of them (I have 3),  did a double take on my armpit - sniffing at it.  I thought it was strange and mentioned it to dh, who made some joke about BO.  So I  got up, got busy and forgot about it. Then in the afternoon I had a lot of sudden pain under there. When I reached under my shirt to feel what was going on - I discovered the torn skin. The nipple appears to be next - I see the raised inflamed areas you've mentioned, and the peeling is starting.    !!!!  I brought out the pain meds last night, and that helps.  I am happy that I had time to get my house cleaned up before this started.  What a mess things were after nearly of year of treatments. It was kind of overwhelming, but I used the Flylady site to help me tackle the chores in small bites. (Anyone else familiar with her?  She's a proponent of using timers to help you get past procrastination... doing something like clean the kitchen for 10 minutes only.) Anyway.... now I'm not doing much again.  I had stopped doing the compresses when tx finished, but I was continuing with the cream. Oddly, the worst spot is the deepest part of my arm pit where the cream would clump up. It was very moist in there, and I think that might have contributed... but who knows for sure.  Jules, I do hope they get to the root of what is causing your stomach trouble. It's hard enough to have the localized pains - stomach issues really must make things hard.  ",

If so, this calls for a huge group hug!  I went for an annual eye exam and saw a new eye doctor who was full of information about tamoxifen...  I had told him I refused tamox tx, and instead of the expected shocked look, I got a nod of understanding. He said he has seen some serious SE's regarding vision due to this drug. (Which was NOT among the SE's I had been told about - irreversible damage to the eyes that is reported as tying to see the world though a puddle.)  He also told me they are releasing more and more data that reveals the benefits are far less than originally reported - and that the five year protocol is too short to make any impact, and that most women have to take the drug for at least 10 years in order to see any advantage.   Which of course that increases the risks and SE's....  Has anyone else heard this? ",
