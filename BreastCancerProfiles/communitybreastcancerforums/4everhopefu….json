Still doing chemo and if and when I'm done with this round, I will ring that bell loud and clear.  It's your own personal preference if you want to ring that bell or not, but I say GO FOR IT!  It's one hurdle over and done with!  Good Luck!  xoxo  Helen",

Throwing my own party and having all the ones I love and who support me was not \"tacky\".  Totally different from throwing my own bridal shower.  I posted this celebration on here to give any of the ladies on here HOPE.  Not everyone with this terrible diagnosis has a strong positive mind.  I do and have from the beginning and  said that I would beat this \" statistics bull S \".   From your post, I get the feeling that you do not have a positive outlook on your disease.  I do not think of my 5 years as using up my limited years.  I hope & pray each and every day that I live to see tomorrow.  I will continue to celebrate!",

Good luck and stay positive.",
