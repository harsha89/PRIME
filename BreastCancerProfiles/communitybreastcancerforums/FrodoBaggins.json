    "Content": "FrodoBaggins wrote: I had a mammogram a few weeks ago that was inconclusive. Went back for additional mammo stuff plus an ultrasound. US found three \"cysts\" in my left breast. I went back last week to have two of the cysts drained. One drained perfectly, clear fluid plus a few blobs of fat, no problem. The second one ran away from her and she chased it for awhile. When she finally got the needle into it, nothing came out. She tried again with a bigger needle, still nothing. It's solid. I'm having it biopsied on Wednesday. The third \"cyst\" is a problem. It has a 1 cm marble looking mass sitting in the middle of it. It looks creepily like the Eye of Sauron from Lord of the Rings, thus my user name. Anyway, it's also being biopsied on Wednesday. It and the other solid cyst are rather close to each other in my areolar area, I don't know if that means they are related. My BIRADS is 4c, and she estimates it has an 80-90% chance of being malignant. I am a cancer survivor, 2 1/2 years clear (no evidence of disease but not considered cured yet) of cervical adenocarcinoma (one of the rarer, more aggressive forms of cervical cancer), so I've been in this position before, and I have to admit, I really didn't want to be in this position again. One thing I learned from the first cancer journey was never worry before you have something to worry about. I know my biopsies could still be benign. The odds are just not in my favor. At this point I'm numb. And I'm ready to get the biopsies over with so I know for sure what I'm dealing with. Anyone else have a solid \"cyst\"? What was it? And the Eye of Sauron????
