Thanks so much for the reply.  As for the chemo, I definitely want good odds for my mom.  I learned a long time ago that she is hard-headed and will do or not do whatever she wants to do.  Hopefully, a cancer specialist who really takes the time to gently and compassionately explain and educate her towards making the right decision...",
