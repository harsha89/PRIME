You made the right decision for you and your family.  You will all get through this and soon be on the other side of it.  Hugs to you all.",

I have been overwhelmed with offers too and I had to make a conscious effort to let people do this.  For them.  It's not that they see me as needy, it's that they want to show me they love me.  Every time it's difficult for me to accept, I remind myself that it's a gift to them to do it. I'm thrilled for you that you have such loving, caring support.",

When my IV came out, I went over and rang that bell with great joy.  And then I had my mother and brother ring it since they've been through this ordeal with me.  I don't even care that I have to ride out side effects still.  I'm just full of joy that it's over, gratitude to everyone who helped physically or in thought, pride that I did it with strength, and relief that I still have hair.",

I also had big trouble last time with vomiting the first night and a low grade nausea for days after.  This time I had Emend and that also made a huge difference.  No nausea at all last night.  Even had some pizza while continuing with the cold caps at home.  Today, I'm a little shaky and tired, but I don't have that feeling that I've been through a battlefield.  The lesson I learned is to make requests of people and they are happy to step up  and help.  Reducing anything that contributes to stress is really important.  And finally, puking is no fun so get help to stop it.  lol Have a beautiful day, with no SE's.",

Saw my onc yesterday and she has now prescribed Hydromorphone.  She doesn't want to reduce my chemo because the tumor had been large.  So I guess I have to tough it out. I don't feel ready for another round tomorrow, but I keep telling myself that I only have 3 more.  And every round is different so who knows? I'm cold capping and still have a good covering of hair.  Shedding seemed to reduce in my last AC round and appeared to be much less in my first T round.  But somehow, I'm looking quite thin around the crown.  ACT is the hardest regimen on hair and it's possible that I may shed out before I get to the end.  But I believe I'm going to come out if this with hair.",

I'm cold capping and still have my hair.  I shed about a handfull each day and that has been about the same in cycle 3 also. One more dose of AC.  I will be glad to switch to the T stage of this.  I hope it will be easier.",

They have opened and are slightly weeping but that is all. I just keep the area protected. They don't hurt at all. The red suddenly went away the other day. I still have a red square where the boosts were, but the rest is back to normal colour; not even tanned. I feel very fortunate. I have had so little skin trouble. The fatigue has even been manageable so far. I volunteered for Run For the Cure only a couple of days after my last rads. I ended up sleeping for 2 days, but that is the worst it's been. To all you ladies still in rads, hang in there. It will be over soon.",
