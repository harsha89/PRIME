I had posted before explaining that I had a surgical biopsy done on July 7th because I had microcalcifications. It was benign but I have ADH. Was told by surgeon that I needed to see an oncologist, he was going to send my report to gyn and she would call me back with a referral to one. I ended up calling her back on 8/19 because I had not heard from her yet. She did not realize she was supposed to call me back; she thought the surgeon had given me referral. Told me to call oncologist to make appt, and she would fax over my report. I waited until the next day to make sure the report got there to call oncologist for appt. When I called the oncologist, the receptionist said they received my report and the dr would look at it and she would call me back to make an appt. Yesterday was a week. I called her back today. They said they did not have my phone number to call me back. AAUUGH! She made an appt for me for sept 11th, then she asked what type of insurance I had, guess what, they do not accept it. She then told me to call my gyn back to get a name of another oncologist to see. So...I called my gyn's office, explained what happened and they are going to get back to me because.... she is on vacation today and all of next week. Log in to post a reply",

It has now been 2 weeks and still have not heard anything from anyone.  What should I do?  Am I just being impatient? Log in to post a reply",
