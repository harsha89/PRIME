I\u2019m too skinny as well. I\u2019d be scarred everywhere to get the fat. I\u2019d like to keep my existing implants. 34d. If they get ruined from radiation I\u2019ll have to change my course at that time. Wondering how they fill up the top polar region to get where i want yo be. D breast. Fat transfer? Willing to go to C but will need mastopexy. Too many options This is the 2nd set of implants I have had in 25 years. 2 mastopexys as well. These are silicone under muscle. Old ones were saline above. The alladerm has held them up nicely. Im consulting with 3 docs. They all have have different ideas. Gotta. Place your bet and take your chances. What do u think? What did u do? I\u2019ll do skate Flap for nipples of they gotta come off. No tattooing either",
