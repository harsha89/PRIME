It was very nice and relaxing but of course I cannot afford to do that all the time. She told me to resist falling asleep on the couch and do not watch TV, read, etc in bed. Well I did that and believe it or not, I slept 5 1/2 hours!!!  It was great but of course it's not happened since.  I slept on the couch for a couple of hours early last night from about maybe 9:00 pm  to 11:00 and have been up ever since and it's after 7:00 am. I feel like I'm going out of my mind.  I just don't know what to do anymore.  I am really trying not to dwell on the fact that I am dying but it's so hard especially when I'm home alone all day.  I look terrible between my very puffy steroid face (and body) along with the bags under my eyes from lack of sleep. My hair was short (I was told it would never come back in after WBR and SRS but it did).  I starts growing back and sticking out all over the place and I spend so much time trying to gel it down. I went and got it cut really (really) short yesterday. Now my face looks even fatter.  It does grow very fast so in a week or two it will look better. In the meantime, I can throw a wig or a hat on if I want. I'm usually just home alone so it will be more comfortable for me around the house.  I could certainly handle things alot better if I were getting sleep. It has been a long 11 years dealing with cancer but things really changed after after the lung mets (3 years ago) and really changed after the brain mets (a little over a year ago).  I miss working, getting out of the house, being around people and feeling a sense of accomplishment. It's very hard to sit around the house. It's also hard to know that I am dying. I think about how much I will miss my son, husband, family and friends.  I love where we live. I look around and think about how I will not be here anymore.  I'm cooking a small Thanksgiving dinner this year, it will be nice.  I am just hoping so bad for some sleep and peace with dealing with everything that is going on.  I don't want to dwell on the fact that I'm dying although I must admit that it is hard sometimes.  I still just can't believe it's finally come down to this although I knew it would someday.  Up to this point, I've always beaten the odds.  They told me I had 6 months or less left a little over a year ago. I would love to have another 6 months or year of quality time left. By the way, I am NOT depressed. I was depressed when my husband of 20+ years left me when I was first diagnosed with cancer (our son was only 7 yr. old at the time).  I took different antidepressants for maybe a year and hated them. Thank you for listening to me and sorry if I repeat myself a lot. It's just that seem to be struggling with the same issues. It's so hard for other people to understand that cannot relate. Log in to post a reply",

Of course I cannot wear any of my old swimsuits. Today I went to the shop where I got my prosthesis and bras and the mastectomy swimsuits were between $90 and $100. Yikes!!  I looked to see if I could sew pockets in my old suits but no way.  They are too low cut and my scar is too high.  I also tried on some of my summer tops. I will not be able to wear some of them as they are too low cut. I did pick up some lace at the fabric store and figured I could sew a lace inset to the tops that would look like a cami underneath. They do make bras that have the lace inset in them but I can't get new bras until July (insurance issue).  It may seem trivial to worry about this especially with being Stage IV but hey, I may be around awhile and I want to go swimming!! (We have a pool).  Also, I was told I can wear my silicone prosthesis in the pool but need to rinse it off afterwards. I hope this is true as I do not want to ruin it since it was almost $400.  I'd appreciate any feedback on this. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

(I know that maybe I should be posting on the Brain Mets site but...)  I was told over 12 months that I maybe had 6 months left.  Well they have now stopped treatment completely as the mets are growing in both the lungs and the brain. (Have done both WBR and SRS)  They said that it's the brain mets that will bring me down.  My Medical Onc. is saying just a few months but the Neuro Oncologist is saying maybe up to 6 months.  He says I look really good compared to most people in my situation and I'm getting around okay. I know that will eventually change. I try not to dwell on everything but it's so hard. I am married with and 18 yr. old son.  I cry when I'm home alone (which is most of the time between my husband's work schedule and my son's school schedule and social life).  I am very scared and sad.  I just hope that when my time comes, it will be fast and that I don't linger.  (Don't we all). I am hoping to make it at least through the holidays (but of course I make it longer). I'm cooking a small Thanksgiving dinner (not my usual big spread with a lot of people).  It will just be my son, husband, mom, and best friend) I'm looking forward to it.   A major problem that I am having now is extreme lack of sleep due to the steroids I take for the brain mets.  It's been going on for months. I am on 4 mg. Decadron for the edema that is surrounding the tumors in my brain. I used to take Restoril (5 mg) then increased it to 10 mg.  They are no longer working.  I sleep maybe one to 2 1/2 hours max.  I'm absolutely exhausted but yet can't sleep.  The Onc. prescribed 5mg Ambien but I've heard horror stories about that from friends and have read things that just scare me about it. Can anyone share experiences (good or bad) on this?  I tried a 25 mg Benadryl (a friend takes them for sleep and the Advice Nurse said give it a try).  I only slept about 2 hours then was wide awake in the middle of the night.  Tonight I will try 2.  I really cannot handle this lack of sleep. Sometimes I will fall asleep on the couch for maybe a 1/2 hour to an hour.  I really would appreciate any advice or suggestions regarding the sleep issue. Thanks for listening.  Like I said, I don't post often but do log on often.  I guess I'm just a Lurker!!  Log in to post a reply",

Did that make any kind of sense??  Well my chemo was cancelled on Thursday as my Platelets were at 45 which is very low.  The normal range is 140-400.  They were a little low last treatment at 136 but they did the treatment anyway. I've only had 2 of the new treatments (Carboplatin)  They are going to give it another week to see if the Platelets increase. I will have labs next week on Wednesday and am scheduled to see the Onc. and have chemo on Thursday.  That is of course if my Platelets have increased by then. I asked the Charge Nurse if there was anything I could to do get them up and she said no. She said just rest, make sure I eat and try to sleep.  I was bummed it was cancelled but glad that the Dr. was willing to continue treatment.  In my last post I mentioned how my Tumor Marker (CA15-3) had skyrocketed.  I had another one taken but deliberately did not ask about it so I'm not sure if it went up or down. Of course I'm hoping it went down. I will talk to the Onc. when I see her on Thursday.  I'm still not sleeping much. I hate taking the Decadron and am down to the minimal dose. I am currently taking Restoril for sleep and just increased the dose from 15 mg to 30 mg (sorry if I'm repeating myself from my last post). I really don't like taking sleeping pills at all but I just can't go on like this anymore. I took a 30 mg last nighit and only got about 4 hours sleep which is better than the maybe 2 hours I had been getting.  Maybe it's time to change to something else. I don't want anything that gives you that \"hangover\" feeling the next day. Any suggestions?  I'm trying to take it easy which is hard for me as I'm a total Type A personality and always have to be busy so you can imagine the Decadron on top of that!! I'm running around like a crazy woman! As I mentioned before, I've been coming on the site for a long time but have always been more of a \"Lurker\".

      "Content": "julie26 wrote: I have posted a few times over the years but have always read the posts. I figured it was time to do it again as I seem to be really struggling. To make a long story short, I was was first dx in right breast in 2001. I lumpectomy, AC and rad.  At the time I was going through a divorce after a 20+ yr. marriage and it was a very difficult time in my life.  I had a recurrence in left breast in 2005 and once again had lumpectomy, AC and rad then 1 year of Herceptin. (Stage I, no node involvement either time).  I remarried in 2005 and 2 years ago moved to an area that we've been wanting to move to for a long time and I love it here. Then the economy hit and effected us like so many others.  I was working part time then went back full time to help make ends meet.  In May of this year, I felt a lump above my breast by my previous port scar. I had been complaining for at least a year of pain in that area but nothing ever showed up.  This time I asked for a digital mammogram (I had just had a regular mammogram 9 months earlier that was clear as it was the other 2 both times I had cancer).  I also had an ultrasound of the lump which did not show up in the mammogram as it was above the breast. BINGO, CANCER!  I just knew that something was there. I also had a small tumor in the breast along with microcalcifications.  The lump I felt was actually a lymph node that had been engulfed by a 2 cm tumor. I had 3 other lymph nodes removed that were negative.  I had a CT scan and they found 6-10 nodules in the lungs that are of course suspicious for metastasis.  At the first meeting with the Onc. I was so upset over the lung issue.  She seemed like she was not very concerned about it at all.  She said they are small (the biggest is 6 mm) and that she cannot even biopsy them as they are so small.  I of course am freaking out and thinking cancer is going to win this time.  I asked her to be up front and to not sugar coat anything and she said she is.  She said she is not sure how to stage me and is treating this as a recurrence of the original cancer in 2001. (I wasTriple- the first time, ER/PR- and Her2+ the 2nd time and this time it is once again Triple-).  She said she is treating it aggressively as Stage 4 but honestly feels that I have a fighting chance.  She also said that half of it will be up to her and the medicine and the other half up to me. I have a friend that went to her and she was Stage IV and she was very up front and honest about that with her and did not sugar coat it. I am currently on Taxol and Avastin.  If all goes as planned, I will also have radiation (I've been radiated on each side before but this area is above the breast so they should be able to radiate again) then I'm supposed to have the other breast removed and reconstruction.  I am really trying to be positive and put up a good fight to beat this but I'm tired both physically and emotionally. Plus with my husband's work so slow and me on disability we are really struggling financially. I'm on State Disability.  Because of the way they go back so many quarters to figure your benefit amount, it went back to my part time pay, not my full time pay so I'm bringing home about 2/3 less than I was when I was working. I also pay $400 a month for my medical alone (on top of the co pays). I will be turning 50 in December and the new rates come out in January so I will be getting the regular rate increase in addition to going into a higher rate age bracket.  I miss working. I sit home every day by myself as my husband is at work and my 15 yr. old son is at school. Then he goes with his dad every weekend and my husband works every weekend. I have way too much time to think about things. I try to stay busy but it's hard. I do not have family close by and not many friends to get together with as we are fairly new to the area and all of my friends work.  Part of me wants to trust what the doctor is telling me and fight with all I have and part of me just wants to give up and throw in the towel.  It's hard, I just don't know what to do.  Sorry to ramble on so much. I just really needed to vent and I know that so many of you can understand. I think I will post this in both the Recurrence and Stage IV section. I'm just really lost right now. I'd appreciate any stories of hope  or encouragement that may be out there.  Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

I was told that my hair would never come back after the WBR (I'd already lost it 3 times before from various chemos).  Well it did come back. It took 4 or 5 months and I also had a bald strip down the middle at first but it has finally filled in. (I called it my \"Reverse Mohawk\"!!).  I got little round bald patches after the SRS but that has also filled in.  I'm glad I can at least put a baseball cap on and I have some hair underneath. I even did it when I had my bald strip as the hat covered it.  My problem now is it is just thick and fuzzy and I can't do much with it. But hey it's hair. I did go get the back and sideburns trimmed so at least it looks decent under the hat. Speaking of hair, I was first diagnosed 11 years ago at age 41. I had never cut my hair.  It was down to my calves and was very thick.  It was hard to lose all of it in the way that I did.  I'm 52 now so I'm thinking I'd probably be a little too old for all that hair now though!!  I have the long braid that I had cut off. My son thought it was cool at the time (he was 7). He turned 18 yesterday and now thinks it's creepy. I think I can still donate it.  The braid is probably 4 1/2 feet long and very thick. I'll have to check into that.  Hang in there. Your hair will fill in. It just takes time. I see that you live in Puyallup.  I used to live in Enumclaw and worked in Renton. I have a lot of family in the Puyallup, Auburn/Kent and Bremerton areas. WA is a beautiful state, I wish I would have stayed there. Take care.",

I also got a staph infection after the last biopsy in May 2007.  I had a hard lump that the surgeon said could take 6 mos or more to go away.  It's gotten a lot smaller but it's still there.  I'm not sure if the pain is from all of this or not.  I have pain in my breast and a little higher and around my ribs on the side.  It feels like a very deep pain in my breast.  Both times I had cancer I was told I did not.  I had a clear mammogram on the left side but was feeling pain (the same kind I am now) when I would move certain ways. I insisted they do an ultrasound and biopsy. Bingo! Cancer!  I know that after having cancer (especially twice) you tend to worry about every little ache and pain.  Some of it is just age and pain you'd have anyway.  I just have a feeling something may not be right.

My old Onc. did a bone scan and said it was fine. He said even if it was cancer, the pain would not come and go, it would be steady.  I also had a nodule in my lung and 2 lesions on my liver. He repeated the scans on that 6 mos. later and said it didn't change so it's fine. Probably cysts in the liver.  I would appreciate any comments or advice.  I would like to hear about symptoms of recurrence and/or mets from anyone willing to share that information. Thank you.

(Of course I had to stop when the brain mets were discovered).  I am doing chemo for lung and Mediastinal lymph node mets. I've been on Taxol, Avastin and now  Gemzar for the past 2 1/2 years straight. I'm doing pretty well overall and while not in denial by any means, I continue to remain positive and hopeful.  I want to thank each and every one of you for the support and encouragement you provide to so many.  It's amazing the strong bond that we can have with people we've never met.  I don't anyone could understand it unless they experience it.  I go to a local cancer support group called 'THE HOOTERS\"!!!  The name says it all. They are a great group of gals. One of the women that facilitates it, had cancer like 30 years and did radical Cobalt treatments. We have many women that are 20, 25, etc. years out and of course we have others that  it's been less yeasrs or are newly diagnosed.  They are a crazy group of women and I love them!!   I am just so excited to get today overwith. My dad sent me a nice gift to go have a massage, manicure and pedicure which I will do next week before I start chemo. It will be nice to relax. Thanks again for everything. All of you are amazing.  Log in to post a reply",

It seems to be one area in my throat.  It started out right after chemo with being hoarse then it started hurting. Sometimes it will ease up for a day or 2 but comes back.  I've mentioned it to my Oncologist, Oncology Nurses and the ENT I saw for my sinuses. They all say it's throat ulcers from the chemo. Some get mouth ulcers but it can also cause sores in the throat.  I did get Magic Mouthwash which they told me to let a little run down my throat a couple of times a day.  It helps a little. I'm just wondering if anyone else had problems with this and what they did to deal with it.  Also, my Tumor Marker (CA 15-3) was stable at around 31 then it jumped to 45.  I freaked out but the Onc. said she is not too concerned at this point. She says she goes by what the scan shows.  I have lung mets and started out with 10 tumors. Last scan showed 7 are gone and the 3 that are left have shrunk significantly.  I don't understand why the markers are jumping. She also said that inflammation can cause them to go up.  I had an infected port that had to be removed which she said was the source of inflammation. Plus I'm thinking that my sinuses and throat are always irritated from the chemo so I would think that would also be inflammation.  I'd appreciate any comments on the throat ulcers and Tumor Markers.  Thank you.

I had lumpectomy, chemo, radiation, no node involvement either time.  I was having a hard time as I was going through a divorce after a 20+ marriage.  I moved on the best I could and have since remarried a man I met in a Cancer Support Group. I had been having pain above my left breast for awhile and the Drs. thought it was scar tissue from where my port was. I just knew it was cancer but they never found anything. (Mammograms were also clean on my 2 prior cancers, I just had \"a feeling\"). In May I put my hand where the pain was and there was a lump.  (Above my breast but below my collar bone).  Sure enough cancer.  I had a left mastectomy in June and started chemo (Taxol and Avastin) in July. 1 positive lymph node and CT Scan showed 6 -10 lung nodules.  I got good news on my last CT Scan.  All but 3 of the lung nodules have disappeared and the ones that are left have shrunk significantly.  For some reason my tumor markers went up. Onc. said she is not concerned about that as inflammation can cause markers to go up. She said the proof is in the scan.  I had an infected port which said could have caused the inflammation. I had it taken out and new one put in a few weeks ago.  Onc. said I will be on chemo indefinitely.  I am doing okay overall but have a terrible time with my sinuses.  Headaches, nasal congestion, nose bleeds, etc. I am going to be referred to ENT.  I was supposed to originally get the other breast removed and have reconstruction 3 to 6 months after my first surgery. That's before we knew I had lung mets.  Now I feel like I will never be able to get it done.  At first it did not bother me but it's hard sometimes to look in the mirror and see one breast not to mention I can't wear a lot of my clothes.  The Onc. did say since things are going so well, I may be able to take a break in about a year and move on to radiation. We are not sure if I can get radiation again or not since I've already had it in both sides. It all depends on if the area is in the prior radiation field or not.  I am pretty positive and upbeat most of the time but I just feel like I'm in limbo right now.  Plus I get so bored at home.  I have been put on Soc. Sec. Disability so I'm not working.   I'm sure a lot of you can relate to how I feel and I'm sure it's normal.  I'm wondering if anyone else has had problems with their sinuses and with tumor marker (CA 15-3) fluctuating.  (I'm going to post this both here and on the recurrence/mets forum).

I'm just learning to knit and spend time on it everyday.  I also sew hats and bring them to the Pediatric Oncology Ward and to the adult Ward where I go. I especially like making the ones for the kids. I try to make them a little whimsical to brighten their spirits.  I am checking into volunteering at the Hospice Thrift store by my house. Maybe one day a week.  I go to a monthly cancer support group and have met some really nice ladies there.  I keep in touch with a lot of them and sometimes we get together and do something but most of them work during the week and are busy with their families on the weekend.  I do have a dog. She is a 14 1/2 yr. old Black Lab. I love that dog.  We've been through a lot together. I talk to her all the time!!!  She doesn't answer me back with words but does with her heart.  She's great.  I think part of my problem is I never let go of my divorce and ex husband and I don't feel connected to my current husband. I know some of that is because I have not let go of the past but to be honest, he really should not be married. He is 57 and never had children.  He was married before but it was a short term. He is very kind and has good intentions.  He thinks just working and providing is enough. He never had a long term, commited relationship or kids so he really doesn't know what it's like or what it entails.  He's never been involved with my son. He loves him and is good to him but he's not the type to go fishing, throw a ball, etc.  He is tired when he gets home from work and just watches TV every night.  We talk a little but it's usually about his work.  He really does not like to do much.  I love to be outside in the spring and summer.  We have a beautiful backyard and never go out there together. He does not really like to do yard work and only does it because he has to.  He does not like to do things on the house at all.  My ex and I lived on acreage and were always outside or always doing something on the house together. I miss that. I also miss things like going fishing, for a car ride, a picnic, etc.   I will admit I remarried on the rebound (I was married 21 years the first time).  I did it for all the wrong reasons. I was a single mom with a 7 yr. old son and had cancer.  I was scared. We were dating during my first diagnosis then got married right after I was diagnosed the second time.  Sorry, I know this is a breast cancer forum not a divorce forum.  I really don't want to take anti depressants as I took them at the beginning and did not like the way I felt on them.  (I tried different ones).  I do not feel down every day.  I am so grateful that I've lived long enough to see my son grow up. I always prayed that I just wanted to see him graduate from High School.  He will graduate next year.  I don't mean to sound ungrateful in any way as I know many women do not get the chance to see their children grow up.  I am very lucky. Sometimes it's just hard to deal with it all.  I'm really getting tired of treatments and would love to go back to work.  I'll try the volunteering thing and maybe take a class or two. I need to get out of this house. I do walk most days. We live in the foothills so it's very beautiful and I love to get out and walk. Some days I have to force myself as I'm exhausted but do feel better once I get out and do it. Again, thank you all for your support and encouragement. It means so much.  Log in to post a reply",

That kind of scares me as my Neuro Oncologist said that as the brain tumors progress, I will became more tired and want to sleep more. The reason it scares me is I'm not sure if that's why I am so tired or if it's because I'm just plain exhausted from not sleeping at night.  Ever since I had the Pericardial Effusion done several months ago, I get up several times during the night to use the bathroom so that is interrupting my sleep. I have fluid that drains and builds up in my abdominal cavity.  I drink water but that is not from that and my lips are very chapped and dry no matter how much water I drink.  I despise taking the Decadron as it makes me so jittery. I wish there was an alternative. Maybe I should talk to my Neuro Oncologist.  I have one more appt. with my Medical Oncologist next month.  My Neuro Oncologist wants me to start Hospice.  I told him that I am functioning fine.  I believe my Medical Oncologist also wants me to stop seeing her since there's not much she can do for me now that my treatment has been completely stopped.  I do not feel that I am ready for Hospice. I clean house, cook, do laundry, etc. with no problems. I'm not sure what Hospice would even do for me right now.  I have my husband and 18 yr. old son around to help me if I need anything.  I'm just not sure what to do anymore.  I'd appreciate any comments and/or feedback.

(About a year before I met him).  He had radiation to his head and says that ever since then, he just seems to get so tired.  So maybe it's a little bit of that plus being boring!!  I am very outgoing and social so it makes it kind of hard.  He really does have a good heart and is a very kind, gentle (but boring!!) man.  I do get sad sometimes but as I said before, I do have joy in my life.  Things are just so different since my divorce. I just feel like a piece of my puzzle is missing if that makes sense.  Well I'm off for a walk before it gets dark.  Thanks again.",

We were going to go to Hawaii but with all that's gone on, I cannot fly. He booked a trip at a beautiful hotel overlooking the ocean (In CA). I hope we can make it if even for just a couple of days.  I've been dealing with cancer for so long and always knew that someday it would probably win.  I think that time has come.  I guess I feel a little sad to leave my family.  Well thanks for listening.

That is the same area where I discovered the tumor 2 years ago that led to this 3rd diagnosis (I also had tumors in the left breast).  The Breast Surgeon told me when he did the surgery 2 years ago, that he could not be sure he got it all in that area and recommended I have rads. if I could (I've had already had rads. on both sides with the two previous cancers and they were not sure if that area was in the prior field of radiation or not. If it is, I would not be able to get rad. again anway).  Once they found out I had lung mets, the radiation took a back seat to treating the lungs.  This Surgeon said he is not too concerned with that spot as it could even be inflammation from the prior surgery (not sure how it can still be inflamed if surgery was 2 years ago). I will discuss that further with my Onc.  The good news is, the lungs are stable (yeah!) and there is no evidence of cancer anywhere else (yeah again!).  I am scheduled for a surgical biopsy on Aug. 8th. He will remove as much of the mediastinal lymph node was possible. The want to see if it is indeed breast cancer and not another kind of cancer (he believes it is) and if so, does have the same pathology as the BC they are now treating me for. I was scheduled for chemo on Aug. 4th but the Surgeon said he will contact my Onc. and recommend we skip that one so my immune system is as strong as it can be for the surgery.  I am of course not thrilled that the cancer has spread but am grateful the news was not worse as I know it could have been.  Once they get the path. report back, they will decide what chemo to change me to. (Currently on Taxol alone).  Prior CT scans have shown lung tumors are shrinking/disappearing but CA 15-3 continued to rise 4 months in a row (before it would fluctuate up and down).  That is why the Dr. ordered the CT and PET scans.  The CA 15-3 started \"trending\" up.  I'm not sure what lies ahead but I will just take it as it comes. Just like I have through out this 10 year journey. Thanks again for listening and all the support. I am so grateful for this site. Log in to post a reply",

This time it was ER/PR- & Her2+.  Had same surgery and chemo again  along with a year of Herceptin.  Had another recurrence last year in the left breast.  This time it is Triple Negative Stage IV with lymphatic & vascular invasion.  On first CT Scan I had 10 nodules scattered through out both lungs.  I have been doing Avastin and Taxol for the past 15 months (I was going every week but had to change to every other week due to low white count).  The last 2 CT scans show that all but 2 of the nodules have disappeared and the 2 remaining ones have shrunk significantly!!!  My Tumor Marker CA 15-3 started at 31 and went up. It's now at 51 and seems to fluctuate between 47 -51.  At first I was worried about that but it does not seem to correlate with the CT scans. I know that you are scared. I am too at times.

I'm not saying that I don't ever get scared or worry because I do. I just try not to stay in that place too long.  Sometimes I wonder if I'll be here to see my son graduate from High School next year.  But then I wondered that when I was first diagnosed and he was only 7 years old then.  I also wondered it again the 2nd time I was diagnosed when he was 10 years old. He is now almost 17 and I'm still here!  It's not an easy thing to go through but my advise would be to just take one day at a time and do not think too far ahead as it can be overwhelming.  I wish you the best.",
