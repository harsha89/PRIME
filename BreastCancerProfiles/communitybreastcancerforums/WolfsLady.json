I'm sorry that your family is going through so much. I am very thankful that neither of my parents have been touched by cancer.  (My dad has had some pre-cancer stuff removed but nothing breast related.  His father had and 2 of his sisters have breast cancer.)   I'll send prayers to you and your family..   ",

(the breast surgeon) would probably have suggested that we remove it right away if I'd been seeing her when the biopsy results first came in.  But that they felt that things like this were safe to watch for awhile.  I'd done some research so I knew that most doctors removed papillomas and I was still OK with leaving it as long as it wasn't causing problems or growing.  I'm nervous about future pain and what if this doesn't take care of.   Here is what my biopsy report says: Sections of core needle biopsies show and intraductal papilloma with areas of severe usual ductal hyperplasia and apocrine papillary hyperlasia.    - interductal papilloma with focal sever usual ductal hyperplasia. - apocrine papillary hyperplasia - microcysts with aporine metaplasis My last biopsy said benign (fibroadenoma) on it, but I don't see that anywhere on this.  Nor do I see a recommendation from the pathologist.  My last biopsy had that too, (6 month follow ups for 2 years)  Which is what my doctor has me doing anyway because of family history.   Thank you.   High Risk: Log in to post a reply",

(Unless something opens up sooner)  Not that they have ever seen anything I've had on a mammogram.  I know my anxiety is being kicked up by not only that but the frequent stabbing pains in my breast.  I hate to take any medication but I've taken pain meds or anxiety meds more often over the last 4 weeks than I like too.  I never even like to take them when I went through my worst stage after I was attacked (attempted kidnapping) many years ago.  They do help, I just don't like the way they make me feel even in the lowest doses.  So the trade off has to be worth it.  I've been trying some yoga because a friend said it really helped with her PTSD anxiety.  I've also found jogging to be very therapeutic and helpful.  However I don't feel like doing it when I'm in pain an wondering if something is wrong that I could make worse if I do it.  So I feel trapped a bit when I want to go running.  (If you can call my slow pace running.  LOL)  But it might help someone else with theirs.  I highly recommend the C25K program. (Couch to 5K)  It really is amazing.  Although some people have to repeat weeks (or add days) like I did the first time I started it.  There is no shame in that.  When I had to restart it after a back injury toward the end I didn't have to repeat any days.  If you've ever thought it might be fun to jog, but \"I could never do that\" give it a try.  I amazed myself and I wish I'd tried 20 year and a lot of pounds ago.  Really though any kind of exercise can help with anxiety.  It also releases endorphins which helps with your mood in other ways.    I'd love to hear other suggestions.     ",

Which isn't surprising since the area was so raw that it was bleeding for at least 3 days.  I mention this because the nurse indicated that quite a few people have reactions to that clear film so if anyone is having pain away from their incision site they should ask their doctor about this possibility.  I should add that I have had reactions to other bandages.   I hope this helps other women to not be so frightened.  If anyone has any questions about my papilloma surgery feel free to contact me.  My surgeon in Houston did a great job and everything looks much better than I imagined it would.  I know that we all worry about that too. ",

It does sound like typical papilloma symptoms.  I wasn't going to have mine removed because I had no symptoms, but I started having stabbing pains so it's gone now.  Having a simple biopsy is likely not going to stop the discharge or the pain.  The surgery wasn't that bad.  You can check out my posts if you want.  The changes are taking some getting used to but my doctor says that if it's still bothering me after 6 months I can have corrective surgery.  Don't get me wrong they are not huge changes and I feel like I'm being too vain letting them bother me.  Mostly I'm a bit OCD and they don't match now.  That side droops more and the nipple doesn't point the way the other one does.  I don't even notice it as much looking in the mirror as I do looking down when I'm taking a shower or getting dressed.  Pain was minimal.  I don't even think I took pain pills after the first day.  Certainly it was less noticeable than the awful stabbing pains that I had for over 2 months before the surgery.  Let me know if you have any questions.  ",

I'm hoping that the double generation skip (My mom is 70) means that if there was gene there it skipped our line.  But I know that I can't count on that.   I know that my risk was raised some because I didn't have my only child until I was over 40.  I worry because I took fertility meds for about 6 years trying to have him.   I also wonder if having busy breasts raises my risk at all.  But my mom says she had 2 extensional biopsies of benign masses so I guess her's were busy too.  (Her doctor back then recommended removing anything that grew because her grandmother's and aunt had breast cancer.)  But she doesn't seem to know what they were.  I'm guessing fibroadnomas since she was pretty young when she had it done.  Early 30's at the latest.  And that is what 2 of my masses are.  I can't believe how lax she is that she doesn't even know.  I just feel better knowing exactly what I had and rather the risk is very low or if I need to vigilant.  ",
