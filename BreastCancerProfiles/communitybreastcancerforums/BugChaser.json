Ended up having both a paravertebral block and general, but was able to come home yesterday morning (I am 29 and otherwise in good health). My primary tumor was multifocal and 1.5cm. One node of six had a 2mm area in it as well. Currently have four JP drains that should be removed on Monday. Much love to all the fellow January ladies. I wish you all speedy recoveries!",

I had a radiologist in my hometown who refused to do diagnostic imaging studies simply because I was under the age of 30. I was so upset because as a healthcare provider, I knew he wasn't following the radiological guidelines. I ended up going to a breast care center 43 miles away, but it was a great decision.That's where they found the cancer in the mammos/ultrasounds and biopsies. Just be your own advocate and trust your instincts. To all the ladies in this group- I agree about wanting to stay here! And I would be down for a cruise, lol.",

Working 60 hours per week in the office plus 70 of call can be a butt kicker sometimes, lol. Vargadoll- congratulations! What a doll she is! =) To all the ladies- I hope you are all doing well on each of your journeys. I pray each day for all of you. Mine is going well, although we had to go back to the OR yesterday to take all of the nodes on the right side and place the port. PET scan was on Tuesday, and showed more enlarged lymph nodes as well as a large growth in the thyroid gland. Not sure if it is cancer there yet, but we are taking it a day at a time. Love to you all, and have a great weekend. üòä",

I love the humor and the strength in this group. =) My phrase has been that breast cancer is like the Exorcist- there's only room for one of us in this body, so this b#$@* has to go!!!!  ",

My personal favorites as far as street bras have been Jockey High Impact sports bras. They have a hook plus a zipper in the front and offer great compression. I found mine on clearance for $10 a piece, so I was a super happy girl. üòÅ",

First and foremost- lots of love, support, prayers, and positive mojo to all of my fellow sisters walking this path and whom have had or will be having procedures this month.
