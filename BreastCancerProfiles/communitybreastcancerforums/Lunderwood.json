Unfortunately not an option for skin sparing or nipple sparing but I am okay if this will remove the tumor with clean margins. Definitely feeling very anxious. Your good experience and advice has helped me so much. Take care!!!!",

You just don't know how your posts and experiences have helped me through my anxiety and fear! I am right handed as well and will be having the surgery on the right breast so I have been trying to use my left a little more for simple things in anticipation of limited use. (it's not working well but I suspect I will use the left when it's the only option). Take care!!",

      "Content": "Mar 10, 2016 05:52PM - edited Mar 10, 2016 05:52PM by Lunderwood Grandma3X - Thank you so much for sharing your experience. I am currently in neoadjuvant hormone therapy but will eventually have a unilateral mastectomy. (probably late June or early July) I have never had surgery before or even an IV so I am very apprehensive about it. I appreciate your feedback and the information on propofol and paravertebral block. I will definitely ask my surgeon about it when I see her next month. I have always been very active and healthy so I am hoping to be proactive in medication choices during and after surgery. Your quick recovery is wonderful!!! Do you run as well as walk? I am hoping I can resume running fairly quickly after surgery too but I will absolutely settle for walking initially.",

I will keep you posted as I get closer to surgery. Please let me know how it is going for you too and don't hesitate share any and all experiences that you think may be helpful. As far as running, I am mainly a trail runner and it's quite acceptable to walk as needed. Walking 5-6 miles per day is great!! By the way how are you doing with the TE and eventually will you have silicon implants? Because of my small stature and lack of body fat (this is according to the PS - I believe I have plenty), implants may be the best reconstruction choice for me as well. As with the hormone therapy and surgery, I have read many experiences both good and not so good. I am trying to sort my way through all the options to decide what is best for me. Thanks again for your positive comments!!!",

I have saved all of your comments about anesthesia and pain meds to discuss at my next appt. with BS in April. It still looks like an early July surgery date for me. Waiting (and worrying about surgery is so hard) I tried to convince my medical team to move the surgery up but they have convinced me that it will be beneficial to shrink the tumor before surgery. Fortunately I have had only minimal side effects from the meds and injections and the tumor is starting to shrink so I know they are right. Please keep us posted! Your very positive journey gives me hope for the future! Take care!",

That said she always took time to answer any and all questions I have had through this process. I believe that her directness may be too much for some patients, after-all the diagnosis can be very emotional and overwhelming to the patient. I found that Dr. Leitch's confident manner was reassuring especially when I was struggling with so many decisions. This is only my opinion!",
