My doctor did not discuss this situation with me either, i was really upset when i saw the dogears like most of us. This procedure needs to be discussed with women so we all would know what to expect. I throught i was going crazy, everytime i take off my bra they gets in the way and very tender and upsetting to look at.  I should have been told that this was going to look like this, you can see the print on the outside of some of my clothers, and it really gives you a low selfesteem. My insurance did pay for my surgery, but they told me that the excess skin consider comestic, that it was not coverd by my insurance. Anytime a women having this done they need to make sure it's done right, not half step. We women our body is our pride and to me they just want to make morer and morer money instead of making us know about this procedure and the outcome of what might happen. This system is setup to rob us no matter what the cost.",
