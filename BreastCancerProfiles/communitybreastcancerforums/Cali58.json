I had no problems after my lashes grew back. My left lashes were alway thinner during treatments and post treatments. Now, 11 months later, My left lashes are shedding again. Not all lashes, but they have gotten thinner. In 1 cm. Area, I lost all the long lashes and I am getting new ones. A real bummer!!",

I was very anxious about not getting my hair back. My dermatologist, who specializes in alopecia, advised me to use Rogaine for men (5%) or for women (2%) if I preferred, once a day. I bought it and plan to start using it to speed up the hair growth. I am 14 weeks PFC. I used Penguin cold caps, but still lost most of my hair. I have a lot of grey, so it's more difficult to see new hair growth. I noticed that hair has taken longer to sprout in some areas and other areas are fuller. I believe you are just going through the normal regrowth process. Good luck",

I had a good amount of hair. My doctor has alopecia areata, which is caused by her immune system. I researched her and found out that she is really good for treating hair loss. I saw her at UCLA. She also advised me to use Hairmax band 3 times a week, which also encourages hair growth. I have been using Hairmax for several weeks. Both stimulate hair follicles",
