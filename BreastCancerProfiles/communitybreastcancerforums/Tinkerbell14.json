She thought it would be by looking at the mass. She said it\u2019s not positive for estrogen or progesterone. She said more results may come in the next day or 2 regarding other receptors.

Tonight after a sneeze (allergies) my rib cage really hurt (on left side which is the side being treated. Coughing hurts too). I\u2019m worried about weakening of the ribs and fractures. Anyone else?
