I take it every so often when the fear kicks in. I'm a recently dx'd DCIS (I hope) pt and am waiting for surgery. The waiting is the worst part, whether it is for surgery or for that biopsy. BTW, I have had many ultrasound biopsies in the past that were negative, and they're not painful. Hope this helps.",
