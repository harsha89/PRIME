He wanted to be present during the US and told me that he believes that it is either a blocked duct or a cyst. They could see what appears like a \"hockey stick\" in the image.  He also said, \"you have more imaging in your future\" and said he would recommend an MRI in his report. I assume that this is because they also said my breasts are very dense and if we want to identify for sure if it is a cyst or blocked duct this is the best way to do it. I await my PCPs call after she receives the radiologists report, and then we go from there. Only other strange thing to report is that it appears I have inflammation just above my left clavicle, lymph swelling or fatty tumor?  Will have PCP take a look. Looks like an MRI is in my future to rule the Big C out",

About 6 weeks ago I rolled over on to my left side and had a sharp, burning pain radiate in my left breast to my nipple. I didn't think anything of it at the time but then it kept reoccurring. Over the course of four weeks it went from occasional stabbing/burning to a persistent and nagging ache with throbbing. I went to my doctor and explained all the symptoms. She did a breast exam and found a lump at 4 o'clock about 1 cm from the nipple. She ordered a diagnostic mammogram and put me on a 10 day course of antibiotics in case it is just an infection/mastitis. My last mammo was in another state and the radiologist is having them sent to their office. Technician said they would have results either in 3 days or if they wanted to compare to previous results 7-10 days. It is the third day and I am anxious as all get out. And although I'm only 6 days into the antibiotics, there is not a change. Still have persistent pain and a few stabbing/burning pains when I sleep on my left side. Ug... Log in to post a reply",
