My Dr. ordered the test four years ago and I finally took it in August of last year and it came back BRCA 1 +. I wasnt completely surprised given my family history of BC on my maternal side. Last month I had a prophylactic BMX and oopherctomy. They did find DCIS on my right side so honestly I'm glad I went through with the surgery. Go with your instincts about your body.Â ",
