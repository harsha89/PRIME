I was initially diagnosed at age 31 in Feb 2007, and underwent a left mastectomy, chemo and radiation for ILC. Been on tamoxifen since then. At the end of March, I went for my 5 year checkup. I was so excited, as I was certain this was the end for me. Unfortunately extensive bone mets have been identified. I'm scheduled for my first Zometa treatment next week, and wanted to know how I can prepare, and what to expect? Thank you in advance, Janine Initial dx: Feb 2007; tx: Mastectomy, Chemo, Radiation, Tamoxifen.
