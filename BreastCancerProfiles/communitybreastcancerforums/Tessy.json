I had an MRI on Monday and there were 3 areas of low concern that they think may be from the fat grafting I had done in Oct 2014. That was on the non-mastectomy side. I also had some done on the mastectomy/implant area and developed marble size lumps on the top of the breast area which scared the snot out of me (US showed that it was fat). Now I have to have those areas on the left side biopsied. Another procedure and more stress but I guess its better to find out for sure.",

I had looked at so much stuff on the internet that   I was upsetting myself so I stopped for almost a year. Found this site in June of this year, a year after finishing chemo and almost a year after radiation. There is a thread called Breast implant sizing 101 on here that is very helpful for deciding about what type of implant to get. I had my rt mastectomy with TE placed on Jan 08, 2013 and then my reconstruction the following Jan. I am going back in Oct for some revisions of the implant and FG. I had started chemo a month after my mastectomy and then radiation for 6 weeks and then I started on Tamoxifen in Sept 2013. Just started Femara about 10 days ago. There is so much support and information here and so many women with a lot of positive nodes that are doing well and give us stage 3 gals a lot of hope for the future. It has been almost 2 yrs since my diagnosis and I am feeling better every day. Best of luck to you, stay strong and informed!!!",

I am 3 years out from original diagnosis (Nov 21, 2012) I am taking Letrozole and started taking a half a tablet a day ( I was doing the every other day routine because the half life of the drug is 48 hours!) and I feel so much better! Anyway, the NP was not very happy with me for taking half a tablet, \"we don't have conclusive studies in taking half of the recommended dose...etc\" so I agreed to start taking the full dose again to see how it goes. I am trying to be compliant with my medication and have quality of life at the same time. I am thankful to still be here 3 yrs later because I honestly did not think I would be. But the joint pain was too much. I take turmeric, glucosamine, ASA, green tea extract, Vit D & E, CoQ10, magnesium, fish oil to counter act just one pill! They have helped! But I do agree with you, not everyone needs the same dose of the Letrozole. I read that anywhere from 0.5-2.5 mg was effective. I asked to have my estrogen levels checked again and they said it was not necessary since I am in menopause. What type of damage did you have to your knee? I have a torn meniscus and I am wondering if the Letrozole aggravated it? Thanks for posting your longevity!!!",

My youngest was 13 at the time of my diagnosis and my son was in his 2nd year of college. My first thoughts were that I would not be there for my daughter's HS graduation and I would not see my son graduate from college or see either one of them get married. I kept praying that God wold give me just 10 more years! It has been almost 2 years from diagnosis and I am feeling great! My last chemo was May 21 of 2013 and man what a difference a year makes! SO happy for your celebration of 10 years cancer free! FIGHT ON SISTER!!!",
