I had my lumpectomy in March (tumor was just under 1 cm.) I'm having my 5th round of CMF this Monday. I'm actually going to stop after this treament. I have two small children and aside from the very hard day or 2 after the neulasta, the constipation, very little hair loss, some insomnia and hardening veins, I just feel I reached my capacity. My onc was a 19, and my DR said am in a gray zone as to whether I would benefit, so now I am choosing to stop after round 5. Radiation starts in July (20 within 4 weeks). I've had a cold for a couple weeks but any exhaustion is remedied with bedtime soon after my kids fall asleep. I believe in UK they do 4-6 CMF treatments as standard. I just feel comfortable and trust in my gut that what I'm doing is suffice. Thanks for your thread, it helps to read everyone's experience. All the very best!üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è",
