    "Content": "ET5667 wrote: I've been in breast limbo for the last year. I started having issues while breastfeeding my son, including swollen/puffy areola, a dimple in my areola, pain, and enlargement. Two MRIs showed a \"enhanced area\" but they were written off as lactation changes (with a warnings that MRI is not reliable for tumor detection in lactating mothers). 4 ultrasounds showed nothing. Anyways, I finally weaned my son 5 months ago and the issues haven't resolved. In fact there has been no change, so now I'm really starting to worry. At the moment in waiting to get in to see the BS again, who originally wrote me off. One thing I can't find on the symptoms lists is a darkened areola. Just one, the one on the bad side. It's significantly darker than the good side. Has anyone experienced something like this? Â  Log in to post a reply",
