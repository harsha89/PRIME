Did not injure myself and it is located on the outer lower half of breast.Since it is such a distinct circle, should I be worried? Coincidentally, I am going through tests to find out why I have such extreme pain along the right side of my ribs for the past 6 weeks. It is not a kidney stone and next is ruling out mid-back(thoracic) herniation. Could these 2 issues be related? Thanks for help. Log in to post a reply",
