I'm terrified that they're going to find cancer everywhere. My tumor is small (1 cm) and my doctor was positive and encouraging, but now I'm sure that every ache, pain, cough and hiccup is a sign that it's already spread. I actually have had a lingering cough that I have chalked up to allergies and post nasal drip (which I do have). But of course now I'm convinced that it means it's in my lungs too. I had to take one of my boyfriend's Xanax to calm down. Was anyone this scared prior to their scans? How do I cope with this? And what if, God forbid, my fears are founded? Thank you in advance for any reassurance!
