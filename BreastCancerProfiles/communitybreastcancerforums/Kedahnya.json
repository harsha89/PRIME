I\u2019m trying to focus on understanding all of the different tests I\u2019ve had done over the last few weeks and make a list of questions and concerns that I would like to address. I\u2019ve also started looking more in depth at my previous ct scans and such. I\u2019m not one to stress out over every little thing the radiologist puts in their report but some things that were put in I hear it\u2019s nothing to worry about from my doctors but I\u2019m not so sure. I am not one to google everything and think I\u2019ve got some rare disorder or think the worst but how do you discount what the radiologist says because of what the doctor says.",

After receiving the results from my primary care doctor in the morning I had an appointment with the general surgeon 5 hours later who explained the different options and told me that he would be meeting with the tumor board that week but that we could probably have surgery scheduled the following week and then I would more than likely be meeting with the oncologist to discuss chemo and radiation options. I was relieved because I like having a plan and I hate waiting. After meeting with the tumor board he called back to say that they decided I would benefit from a petscan before surgery. I met with the oncologist that week also who said I would more than likely be doing chemo before surgery but nothing would be decided before the petscan and she also wanted an echo and a brain MRI. Finally got all those done last week and met with the surgeon and oncologist both this past Wednesday. Apparently there was something on my occipital bone that they think may be the breast cancer has spread but both told me that they would more than likely remove the sentinel lymph nodes to biopsy hopefully Friday (today) and go ahead and schedule a port placement since either way I will be doing chemo but they were discussing the case with the tumor board on Thursday and would let me know when we could do the surgery. Got the call yesterday evening that they are now referring me to a different doctor at a hospital 2 hours away from where I live whereas their hospital is about half hour away. So now back to waiting on that doctors office to call and set up an appointment which will hopefully be no later than next week. My question is does it normally take this long to come up with a treatment plan or is it just because of as my oncologist put it my \"weird medical history\" and the findings from the petscan? The only family history of cancer in my family has been thyroid, skin cancer and leukemia in two distant cousins until me. I was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma and had one of my kidneys partially removed in 2016 with nothing new showing up yet and they found 5 nodules on my lungs last year still very small that they aren't sure about so we are just doing the watch and wait and so far no changes in a year and nothing showed on the petscan for either my kidneys or lungs. I just don't do well sitting and waiting for the next test or next doctor and friends and family keep asking about what's going on and I try to update them at least each week but it's always well we have to wait to see what they say next week. Any thoughts on if this is just a normal wait time or constructive ways to help with the waiting? Dx 1/29/2018, IDC, Left, 3cm, Grade 3, ER+/PR+, HER2+ (IHC) Log in to post a reply",

I live in a smaller town in Missouri outside of a Military base and probably less than 10,000 in the combined communities and no hospital except for military which I am not so although we have primary care doctors at the medical center it's half an hour to the nearest hospital and even that town is less than 20,000. However they do have a cancer treatment center there which is where I see the oncologist at. A friend was concerned about it being a general surgeon also and wanted me to see about treatment at Columbia University where I had my kidney surgery and where my pulmonary doctor is but that is also 2 hours away and mostly back roads. The doctor the tumor board referred me to is in St. Louis at Washington University and is all interstate to get there. I also have extremely high control issues about driving so being so far away and then having to ride with someone else all the way home is a very big issue for me. After my kidney surgery my Mom drove me home and what should have taken 2 hours took a little over three because I was having panic attacks and I had quit taking pain meds the day I left the hospital because the dr told me I could drive if I had been off of them for 24 hours. The general surgeon and the oncologist had explained that if it had spread that they would more than likely not do surgery on the breast unless there were other issues with it and just do chemo and then radiation. My main concern is what if there is cancer on the bone but it's cancer that has not spread from the breast and now we are just taking more time waiting on the next doctor. I have had other cancer that was not related to the breast cancer so there's a slim chance that could be the case here too.",

I may check out the overnight places to stay as a last resort but I still have 2 children at home age 6 and 16 so I try to be home if possible",
