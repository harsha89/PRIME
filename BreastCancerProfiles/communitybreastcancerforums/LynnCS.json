The pharmacist told me \"it can cause upset stomach\"  LOL!  I just stared at him and said \"You're kidding! Anti-nausea medicine that causes upset stomach? What's the point of taking it then, especially at this price?\"  Haha!  So I don't know ...  On the plus side I feel much better the second week and enjoyed our Thanksgiving dinner .. tho' my taste buds were not cooperating.  Hope you are doing well.",

They put Aloxi in at the time and that lasted four days.  I had no real nausea so I didn't take the Compazine but I was vomiting every 2-3 hours until I could finally keep one down.  My question is how long does the nausea typically last ~ a few days? ~ longer? ~ the entire 21 days until the next tx? I stayed well-hydrated up to now and I don't want to lose ground.  My poor family! With Thanksgiving next week! :( Log in to post a reply",

And I mentoned I had an appointment with an oncologist but are you saying there is a medical oncologist I should consider seeing? My confusion comes from all the contradictory advice I've seen and read ~ I just want to make an intelligent decision based on the oncologist's best advice.  But I desperately hope he listens to me without playing down my concerns and other health issues,  I went into this expecting to lose a boob and it really threw me for a loop when the surgeon said 1/2 sentinel nodes was positive.  She then took 11 more axillary nodes (I misspelled content in the first message) they were negative. Hope this clarifies things.  I'm not thinking too clearlythese days! :(",
