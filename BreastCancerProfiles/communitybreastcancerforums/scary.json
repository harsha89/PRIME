I have a question about follow-up care for my other gynecological parts (ovaries, etc.)  I don't have a regular gynecologist right now.  I go to a sliding scale clinic that did my women's exams and sent me for the mammogram through the best chance network, and now I am on Medicaid.  Is it normal protocol to get my ovaries checked now?   The clinic I went to did the basic pap smear, etc., which was normal, but they said they don't do the uterus, ovaries, etc.  Do I need to get myself a regular gynecologist now that I'm covered?  Do most women who have breast cancer get their ovaries checked too?
