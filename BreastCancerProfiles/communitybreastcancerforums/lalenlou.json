That is what was recommended to me by other BC girls.  I have always been a blonde (with help from my beautician!) and my hair is coming in super thick and DARK!!!  My hair is about 1 1/2\" long, but I still wear my wig when I go outside my home.  My hairline is high and my hair is not yet long enough to cover it.  I just wish hair grew faster than 1/2\" a month!  I bought a wig that looked exactly like my own hair did - in fact, most people are shocked when they find out it is a wig.  Both my family doctor and my radiologist thought it was my real hair and wondered out loud how I did not lose my hair during chemo!!  It was pretty funny!  When my grandkids spend the night with us, I try to get them used to me with my short hair.  My 4 year old grandson didn't say anything when he saw me at breakfast, but about an hour later, he walked into our living room with my wig, still didn't say anything, but he put the wig on my lap and walked away!!  My husband and I laughed out loud!!  I put the wig on and said, \"Now do I look like Grandma?\" ",
