I told my doctor take them off.  I could not live with the fear and I've never regretted the decision.  The surprising thing to all was they found cancer in both breasts of different kinds, invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma in situ. My doctor told me I did the right thing.  The MRI had only shown cancer in one breast. The most difficult thing for me was getting fills in my tissue expanders, but my PS told me we could do less each time and that helped.  My strength is finally back in my arms and chest this year as I found I could do all the things I wanted in my garden again, which was huge to me. I am also feeling more myself.  Don't underestimate that this is a huge surgery.  I needed help the first week in particular since I had drains on both sides, but after that it got better and better.  I've a very independent person and it is hard for me to ask for help, but you will need help at least the first week. Peace of mind is everything.  Good luck to you! ",
