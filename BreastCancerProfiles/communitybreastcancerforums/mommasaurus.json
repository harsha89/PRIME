So the tech takes me in to have another ultrasound done before the dr comes in to do the biopsy. I asked her why this mass looks more suspicious than the other three lesions I have and she says \"it doesn't to me.\" Then she continues the ultrasound and starts taking multiple pics and measurements of yet another area! The dr comes in and I ask about the area the tech had taken pics of and she says if didntvalarm her, she proceeded to do the ultrasound to get ready for biopsy and as she's doing it tells me that she believes it's a cyst/benign and that she may not be able to get a sample because she believes it will collapse. She starts the procedure and ends up taking three samples...not a cyst. I was doing more research today...I know, I know...but it turns out even biopsy results have a high chance of being wrong...WTH!!!",

I have a biopsy scheduled for tomorrow and I'm heard inconsistencies when it comes to what the radiologists will actually tell you at time of biopsy. I know that we technically have to wait to receive the pathology report, but do you know of instances of when the radiologists let you know if they think it's benign or malignant?",

My dr said the ruptured cyst is what\u2019s causing the inflammation which doesn\u2019t make sense, the radiologist actually ruptured my cyst during the biopsy. Chronic inflammation is something that\u2019s been there for more than just that day. I read several articles that say chronic inflammation has ties to cancer and should have short-term more frequent follow up. However my dr didn\u2019t even want to talk about the chronic inflammation. She said it\u2019s not cancer and I shouldn\u2019t worry and we can go back to annual mammo. Confused...
