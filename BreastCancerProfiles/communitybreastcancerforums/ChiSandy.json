If it's a surgical (incisional or excisional) biopsy akin to lumpectomy, and there's a chance that at some point during the procedure you might need intubation &/or general anesthesia, then the NPO (nothing by mouth) recommendation makes sense. But if it's a fine or core needle biopsy all you'd get is a shot or two of lidocaine and you'd be fully awake--so the only things you'd need to avoid are foods. supplements or meds that could increase bleeding and inhibit clotting. But call the doctor whose office said NPO <5 hrs pre-biopsy, and ask him or her why the NPO recommendation.",

My cavity seroma enlarged, my breast was occasionally sore (from the inside) and my nipple is sensitive, and the color of the irradiated skin is pinky-tan. But I had no peeling, itching, blistering, ulceration or even irritated skin. Each time, I immediately slathered on Aquaphor in the dressing cubicle before I got dressed again post-treatment, and used either pure aloe vera gel (no alcohol or fragrance, purchased at the cancer center\u2019s pharmacy) or calendula cream every night (twice daily on weekends). Because I was told to have totally bare skin for 4 hours before each treatment, I showered off the previous night\u2019s stuff each morning before getting dressed. I had a rather unusual situation, though--my SNB incision (in fact, my entire armpit) was outside the radiation field. I didn\u2019t know this before I began treatments (and I was given the same printed handouts as women undergoing whole-breast radiation), so I laid in a supply of cornstarch baby powder and nonmetallic deodorant (Tom\u2019s of Maine) beforehand. Turns out my RO was fine with me using my regular Dove antiperspirant. And because the underwires of my bras touched neither my lumpectomy scar nor SNB incision, he was okay with me wearing my regular underwire bras. (All those wirefree bras--including some with scratchy linings that itch worse than the fancy lace underwires--as well as the shelf-bra compression camisoles I was told I would end up wearing instead of bras--were totally unnecessary)! Now, mind you, I am rather spectacularly overendowed (all you looking for large-cup reconstructions or augmentations, be careful what you wish for). Pre-surgery I was a 38I or 40H. Only an underwire can properly support my \u201cgirls\u201d without sagging. Now, I am a 38J or 40I. Not for the faint of heart, leery of online shopping, nor light of wallet. I did buy some cheap front-close Leading Lady stretch-cotton leisure bras in a few colors for immediately post-op, because the standard-issue surgical bra into which they stuffed me in the OR before waking me up was several sizes too small. (XL? Bwahahahaha). I was told to wear a bra 24/7---and this much was true. I am far comfier in these leisure bras (and maybe those camis) beneath my nighties or PJs than going braless. Word to the wise (wide?)--I had to buy the largest cup size, 40F/G/H, which is still a cup size or two too small. I\u2019d been warned to avoid skin-to-skin contact but I had no irritation--and no reddening--beneath my breast, either. Finally, as long as I got my 8 nightly hrs of sleep, the dreaded radiation fatigue never kicked in. (There went my excuse to bow out of stuff). I will re-post this in a thread called \u201cWomen who had no problems from radiation.\u201d In another thread, in which the OP asked if anyone took endocrine therapy without suffering bad side effects, somebody posited that the majority of patients who post do so because they are having a rough go of treatment; so there ought to be some encouraging threads posted by women who had neither surgical complications nor terrible side effects of various treatments. So when it comes to radiation (and lumpectomy, but for seromas), I am going to be one of those women.",

I want to jump through the ceiling when I touch my forearm skin or rotate the arm in either direction. It is just too exquisitely painful to do my self-MLD. I have ONE LE therapy session left tomorrow. Last Thurs I was doing well enough that the therapist said she would discharge me tomorrow. Instead, I am now in agony---and now even getting pitting edema on the inside center of the forearm. Even my loose (1\u201d of slack) bracelet is leaving divots in my skin, as are wrinkles in my clothing. The seroma in my breast, below the radiation-fibrosed skin, is also getting point-tender. What happened since Thursday? Well, Fri. night I took a couple of guitars in heavy cases (abt. 15 lb.total) that were propped against the wall and moved them (using both hands) less than 5 ft. on to the couch. That\u2019s what set it off. I\u2019m not kidding! Woke up Sat. morning and that\u2019s all she wrote. And I still have just one sleeve, a gauntlet and a glove. (Mediven Glove just arrived Fri.--its matching sleeve was too narrow at the top--the fitter mis-measured me. My brachial circumference lies within both the upper end of \u201cregular\u201d and lower end of \u201cextra wide;\u201d when it arrived, it felt too long and rolled down, cutting off circulation--maybe even THAT did it, not to mention grating cheese, opening a jar and scooping ice cream). So I haven\u2019t been able to wash my Juzo sleeve-gauntlet set; and the LympheDivas set was definitely too long--the entire sleeve, and the fingers of the glove (I have unusually short fingers and small hands). So am awaiting a patterned LD sleeve in Short and matching gauntlet in Small. (They don\u2019t do custom finger-lengths). Fortunately, am able to play guitar with a gauntlet, because the Mediven glove is too stiff for me to fingerpick and its fingertips mute the sound of the strings. (I will save the glove for flight, high altitude on land, and exercise too strenuous for gauntlet or kinesio-tape). I\u2019m hoping the therapist will call Dr. Feldman (the LE therapist who wasn\u2019t even sure I really had LE less than a month ago but reluctantly prescribed therapy) and see if he can come up with another ICD-10 code so my therapy can continue. I am totally bummed out--I may even have to change my BP medication because it has a diuretic--which (counterintuitively) can exacerbate LE. That means I might have to go on something stronger, which can have its own SEs. Cancer is the gift that keeps on giving.....sort of like the Trojan Horse. (And I was only Stage IA).",

Exbrnxgrl (hi--I'm an exbrklyngrl) and BarredOwl hit the nail on the head--you can't regress from Stage IV back to Stage II. Neoadjuvant chemo/AI therapy/rads can shrink a tumor, but once it's in the nodes, it's in the nodes. And once it's spread beyond, it's Stage IV. With treatment, many Stage IV patients can be NED (no evidence of disease) for many years--but they remain Stage IV. And blood tests are not diagnostic of initial breast cancer--only laboratory analysis of tissue removed from a tumor can diagnose breast cancer. Doctors can guesstimate the stage from biopsy and size on imaging, but only after a tumor has been removed and analyzed and lymph nodes biopsied can stage be determined for sure. Look, good nutrition is always a good idea. But if it were the magic bullet, none of us would be on these boards, nor would we ever need to worry about recurrence. It can lead to a healthy body weight, improved ability to achieve cardiovascular fitness, and better health generally--which is great because feeling physically better and having fewer fat cells making (or trying to make) estrogen is always a good thing. And eating more ethically can make a person feel better about themselves and that they're doing something to alleviate animal suffering and benefit the environment. But it can't cure breast cancer. Patch, tell that practitioner thanks, but no thanks. See if your wife's cancer center has an integrative or complementary medicine department (mine includes nutritionists, aromatherapists, music therapists, acupuncturists, martial arts, yoga & meditation specialists) which can increase comfort, fitness, and help ease treatment side effects. But no reputable integrative practitioner would claim that their services can cure cancer, and (s)he certainly wouldn't tell a patient they have to choose between allopathic (conventional) or their alternative therapy.

Adding chemo would have reduced my already-low risk by only another 1%, 2% tops. (Barely a year of overall survival). My MO said the risks definitely outweighed that slim benefit. Chemo\u2019s effectiveness depends on how fast-growing your tumor cells are (which is a major factor for which they test in the various genes in your tumor sample). Strongly ER+ without HER2 overexpression, and a low mitotic rate (1, which means slow-replicating) regardless of whether your Nottingham score makes you Grade 1 or 2, means that your tumor cells would be affected less by chemo than would your normal cells. Yet there are women here who had Oncotypes of 20, and took further tests such as Mammaprint that pegged them as high-recurrence-risk, so they went ahead with chemo. One or two even had 17, still the top end of \u201clow,\u201d and chose chemo because they were young and tumors are more aggressive in younger women. It basically depends on your age, general health (other diseases, or \u201cco-morbidities\u201d) and personal needs (e.g., a musician or surgeon could not live with neuropathy from certain chemo drugs but other patients might be willing to). If you fall into the dreaded gray area and don\u2019t necessarily want chemo \u201cno questions asked,\u201d ask for further testing and get second (or third) opinions.

      "Content": "Jul 8, 2017 09:58AM - edited Jul 8, 2017 10:10AM by ChiSandy My two breasts are quite different: both very large, but the radiated R one is round & perky and the \u201chealthy\" L one droops like a basset hound's ear and is over a cup size larger. (During and for six months post-rads, the cancer breast's seroma had swollen to the point where it looked like the breast had a \u201cchaw\" in its cheek, and was the larger of the two; before cancer, it was slightly smaller than the L). I have found that cups with some \u201cgive\" and support (I wear underwires, but not everyone can\u2014there are wire-free bras with non-woven fabric \u201cslings\u201d inside the cups) are essential. Make sure the band is not too large (it shouldn't ride up) and the cups are large enough to fit the bigger breast perfectly. You'll know they're big enough when the center of the bra sits flat against your chest, separating the two breasts, and not too big for the larger breast if there's no wrinkling. You will have some wrinkling on the top of the cup for your smaller breast. Three ways to go here: 1. Stretch-fabric (knitted or lace) cups, and shortening the strap on the larger side; 2. Pad the smaller breast\u2014I use removable pads from an old cheap Genie bra that was way too small, and I insert them on the lateral side so that the breast gets \u201cnudged\" towards the center and the cleavage looks normal; 3. Get a lightly \u201cmolded\" T-shirt bra\u2014cups are smooth, seamless and the padding is just thick enough to hide the irregularity. If you have small or normal-sized breasts (<DD) you can buy your bras anywhere, and not spend a lot of money. When you\u2019re like me, however (38 H/I before, 40 I/J in the year post-rads, and 40 F/G now), best to go to a dedicated lingerie shop (like Rigby & Peller) or to Nordstrom\u2019s and get professionally fitted. Buy one or two bras there, and then go online to HerRoom.com, FigLeaves.com (or .uk if you\u2019re on that side of the pond) or BareNecessities.com to find that same bra and size in another color or two. I had 16 hypofractionated external treatments aimed at the tumor cavity, and the seroma enlargement was the most severe SE (and as SE's go, not severe at all). Got some pinkness at first but not even any irritation, nor itching, pain or skin breaks; then a tan over my lumpectomy scar. All that's gone now, except that areola is darker & thicker and the nipple isn't as pliable. (Seroma is smaller than before starting rads, and deep inside so it doesn't hurt or drain\u2014mammos feel just like they always did). I finished rads the Monday before Thanksgiving 2015, and haven't seen my RO since. (I see my BS or her NP and my MO every 6 months).",

Maybe your surgeon is carefully weighing one risk against the other. There may be no one definitive answer. Didn\u2019t your hand surgeon know beforehand about your lumpectomy, and that LE risk doesn\u2019t lessen over time? (It can develop at any time after surgery).

It enlarged my mammary seroma and hardened the skin around it, necessitating I replace all my bras with ones even larger (40 I or J) and avoid sleeping on my right side; and it took me from a low risk for LE and gave me both mild cording and stage 0 (posssibly starting to worsen) LE. And this was the shorter, partial-breast protocol--my axilla wasn't irradiated. Would I have done it again? Probably. But would also probably have gone on a drastic crash diet and aerobics program first to lower my BMI by even a point or two to reduce the LE risk (and would\u2019ve held off buying the bras I currently own).",

The hospital's legal dep't wasn't going to let me go through with it because they were afraid I wasn't competent to give informed consent--I mentioned I too am a lawyer (mostly retired) & a cardiologist's wife and was acutely aware of their concerns, so they had me sign an oath in blood that I was not stoned and was informed of a laundry list of possible complications. The radiologist was affable and sweet as well as funny. She used lidocaine, but it took effect even before I could feel her remove the needle. The core biopsy was sort of disconcertingly noisy (the clicks sounded like empty chambers in a game of Russian roulette). It was over fairly quickly and I was able to drive to dinner that night. The radioactive seed placement was done by the same radiologist, guided by ultrasound, with lidocaine (no Valium, as I was NPO). When it was in, a resident from Nuclear Med Geiger-countered me and declared \u201cShe's hot.\" I replied \u201cThank you;\" shoulda replied \u201cthat's what HE said.\" Some still do wire localization, but seed placement is getting more & more common. Why not under anesthesia? First, a general is always risky (and requires the services--and fees--of an anesthesiologist). Even twilight sleep or Propofol can be risky. Why no Valium? If you take one orally, you run the risk of inflaming the nerds & bean counters in Legal. If administered by IV drip, that requires starting an IV, finding a vein--and for the actual surgery, you want as many good veins available as possible. Wanna go back to the good ol' days? In 1975, my m-i-l found her nipple suddenly inverted and went to her gynecologist. Back then, all biopsies were surgical (incisional or excisional), done under general (halothane gas) anesthesia, followed by a frozen section being sent immediately to the path lab. If benign, the patient was sutured and sent to recovery to waken, then sent home with a giant bandage. If malignant a radical (breast, chest muscles, all neighboring lymph nodes and sometimes some arm muscles) mastectomy was performed, with no skin or nipple spared, no thought of reconstruction. The patient found out her tumor was malignant only by waking up without a breast, which was what happened to my m-i-l who had a \u201cmodified\" radical--breast, some arm muscle and axillary nodes removed. That was it as far as pathology was concerned: no grading; staging was purely determined by lymph node status--which if positive was followed by chemo as brutal as that given today...but fewer chemo drugs were available and there were no drugs to deal with nausea nor biologics to help prop up the immune system. Women often didn't survive the full course of chemo, Nobody knew about hormone-receptor status or HER2--there were neither targeted nor endocrine therapies. Radiation treatments lasted longer and were more debilitating. My m-i-l was lucky: she didn't get chemo, but did have radiation. She survived another 32 years, but with permanently impaired mobility; she wore a prosthesis but eventually tired of it and never wore a swimsuit again.",

It\u2019s not DCIS, but probably IDC. Where my report was a bit more complete was that it mentioned the biomarker status: positive for estrogen & progesterone receptors, negative for HER2. The most encouraging finding on her report is the mitotic rare score of 1--which means the cells are dividing rather slowly. Many doctors consider that to be the most important of the three components of the \u201cgrade\u201d score. You can\u2019t yet know the suggested surgical plan without knowing the tumor\u2019s location and size (both absolute and relative to the size of her breast). You will probably know it\u2019s hormone and HER2 status before surgery (they might get that result any day now) . But treatment beyond that point will determine whether whatever surgery she chooses got it all (\u201cclean margins\u201d) and if there\u2019s any cancer in any of the lymph nodes. Those things can only be confirmed after surgery is performed. I didn\u2019t have chemo because of a low Oncotype score, hormone-positive/HER-2 negative status, clean margins and lymph nodes, and my age. I chose a lumpectomy because my tumor was quite small relative to my breast size and conveniently located. Because I chose lumpectomy rather than mastectomy, I did have radiation (a 3-week partial-breast protocol). But chemo and radiation (and they might not be recommended) are doable--and young women generally tolerate it better than those my age or older. Right now, take heart that the tumor is Grade 2 with a mitotic rate of only 1. You can take a little time to get second opinions, weigh surgical options, shop around for the best surgeons/oncologists/hospital for her, and line up friends and neighbors to pitch in and help with running errands, helping with child & pet care, housework, etc. The tumor\u2019s been there awhile, and it isn\u2019t growing quickly enough to panic or decide rashly.

Dollars to donuts this is to protect the facility from prosecution. Why do I say this? First, if OR statutes prohibit radiologist MDs (as opposed to techs) from prescribing controlled substances, why are there several websites for musculoskeletal radiologists in OR who also specialize in pain management? A pain specialist can\u2019t effectively practice with an arsenal limited to OTC meds and non-pharma techniques. Second, I speak from my experience as a former IL Special Asst. Atty.

(With the help of the Pulitzer-prize-winning reporter who broke the Mirage tavern bribery case, we actually found physicians billing for pregnancy tests performed on men and nursing homes billing for slippers for double amputees without prostheses). Freestanding imaging clinics were major culprits--they were often unable to produce original x-ray films or reports to back up their claims for reimbursement--and the baby often got thrown out with the bathwater in that facilities attracting unwelcome gov\u2019t attention for civil offenses not uncommonly got swept up in drug abuse enforcement stings as well. I don\u2019t think IL (or even the Chicago area) was unique, and I\u2019d bet these OR imaging facilities were feeling the heat and were therefore administrative-litigation-averse, as well as feared being enmeshed in drug enforcement sting operations. \u201cCYA\" is timeless and universal.",

What is indisputable is that nobody needs sugar\u2014the only sugar our primitive ancestors ate came from caramelization on the surfaces of the meat they roasted and the occasional ripe fruit that was easy to pick or fell off the tree before famine season rolled around.

I knew that even mastectomy is no guarantee that radiation will be unnecessary, nor is it total protection of distant recurrence or contralateral new tumors. Have a good long talk with your surgeon, ask to see surveys or videos if available (the Emmi series is great, and I was part of a Mayo trial of a decision-tree software algorithm). Discuss with him or her (and your medical oncologist when you pick one) and decide what your lifestyle, needs and goals are and how various treatments would impact timelines and aspects of them.

You are definitely not in the gray area. Chemotherapy's benefit over anti-hormonals alone would be too small in your case to be worth the very real risks. Your tumor is composed primarily of slow-growing cells. Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cells, including healthy ones in your body such as those in hair follicles, epithelial tissue (oral and nasal mucosa, stomach lining, etc.), peripheral nerve endings and bone marrow (which among other functions produces the cells that strengthen your immune system). It cannot tell the difference between fast-dividing tumor and fast-dividing normal and vital cells. It should be saved for those cancers for which it is truly necessary. (First, do no harm). With lumpectomy, you would need to follow up with radiation. Usually, that's unnecessary after mastectomy\u2026but not always. By law, insurance must cover whatever surgery is necessary to achieve symmetry. With your histopathology (especially positive hormone-receptor status), you would be recommended to have endocrine (anti-estrogen, somewhat confusingly referred to as \u201chormonal\" therapy, which is not the same as being given hormones) therapy. The goal is to starve those estrogen-fueled tumor cells. Depending on your age, desire to bear children and menstrual status (pre-, peri-, or post-menopausal), you would be offered tamoxifen, tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression or removal followed by an aromatase inhibitor (AI), or an aromatase inhibitor alone. Tamoxifen blocks the tumor's estrogen receptors so they can't access the estrogen in your body, regardless of which organ makes it; AIs keep the liver hormone aromatase from converting androgens made by fat cells and adrenal glands into estrogens (our bodies make estrogen this way even without functioning ovaries). If you are strongly concerned that despite BRCA-neg. status your sister's early death from breast cancer might be hereditary, I heartily second MTWoman's advice to get more genetic counseling followed by newer tests that look for other mutations such as PALB or Chek-2. Mutations might predispose you to other reproductive or digestive cancers as well. But one step at a time. One foot in front of the other. See your surgeon first, and make an MO appointment as well as genetic counseling. And remember that (as with everything else in life), peace of mind is relative, not absolute. ",

Why do you assume that you will get Tamoxifen, even though you\u2019re postmenopausal (which means that, even though you may still have an ovary, it\u2019s for all intents & purposes \u201cdead\u201d)? Most women assume that, often mistakenly. I assumed that at first, too, because for years & years in lay-oriented medical articles we\u2019d all read that \u201cER+ means taking tamoxifen.\u201d I was panicking and warned my shrink he\u2019d have to pull me off Wellbutrin because it\u2019s contraindicated with Tamoxifen. Until I dug into the Susan Love Breast Book and met with my MO for the first time, I\u2019d never heard of aromatase inhibitors (AIs). When she explained that I would be getting an AI instead of Tamoxifen I breathed a sigh of relief. I could keep taking my Wellbutrin, and though AIs have side effects that mimic and accelerate those of aging, they don\u2019t increase the chances of blood clots, uterine or retroperitoneal cancer the way Tamoxifen does, nor are they contraindicated with as many other meds. (Tamoxifen can also cause cataracts, but mine were already ripe so I had cataract surgery). The reason postmenopausal women (and male bc patients) get AI rather than Tamoxifen therapy is that AIs provide superior protection against metastases in ER+ bc. Even though we no longer have functioning (nor in some cases, any) ovaries, our bodies still produce estrogen through a complex process. Fat cells (not the fat inside them) and adrenal glands make an \u201candrogen\u201d called androstenedione. Our livers make an enzyme called aromatase, which converts that androgen into a type of estrogen. AIs interfere with the aromatase-caused conversion process, therefore reducing the remaining estrogen still circulating in our bodies. AIs are so much more effective in starving ER+ tumor cells of estrogen (Tamoxifen blocks the receptors, but does not reduce the amount of estrogen we make, wherever we make it) that many pre-menopausal bc patients on Tamoxifen start taking ovarian suppression drugs to shut down the ovaries, or even have them removed, in order to be able to switch to AIs. (You can\u2019t take AIs with fully-functioning ovaries, but I am not sure why\u2026the scientists & lay science enthusiasts\u2014paging BarredOwl--here can explain it better).",

From least to most invasive, the types of biopsies are: Fine-needle aspiration: for visible palpable small lumps that are more likely benign, as well as for cysts. They suck out some cells (draining an entire cyst) and analyze them under a microscope. It misses more cancers than other methods. Core-needle biopsy: most common these days due to its high accuracy rate and relative non-invasiveness. Especially useful for masses discovered only by imaging rather than palpable lumps (but sometimes used for those as well). The tumor is located by imaging (most commonly ultrasound but often mammogram and sometimes in the case of dense breasts MRI), the target and surrounding area numbed with lidocaine (very fine needle, takes effect almost immediately), a tiny incision made, and a spring-loaded plastic \"punch\" device fitted with a larger (a bit biggest than used for blood donation) hollow needle takes anywhere from 5-9 \"core\" samples of the tumor, which are analyzed in the lab. Both types of needle biopsies are usually performed by breast-trained radiologists rather than surgeons. Both are closed with small bandages rather than sutures or adhesives+steri-strips. Incisional: used mostly for palpable tumors near the surface that have a high likelihood of being benign. It is a type of surgical biopsy, done by a breast or general surgeon. A local anesthetic is injected. An incision is made and a small piece of the tumor cut out and analyzed. Mostly replaced by core-needle because of the latter's lower discomfort, faster healing, smaller incision and lower risk of infection. If small enough, closed by small bandage. Longer recovery time than needle biopsies (patients getting needle biopsies can often go back to work the same day and resume normal routines the next day). Excisional: the entire visible or palpable mass is removed under general or twilight sleep anesthesia by a surgeon for lab analysis. It used to be the only kind done--a frozen section was examined before closing and waking the patient, and the only way patients knew if they had cancer was if they woke up without that breast. (The norm well into the 1970s,before it was discovered that even aggressive cancers grow slowly enough for women to weigh their options for removing tumors). Except for lack of a sentinel-node locating procedure and biopsy scar, almost as invasive as a full lumpectomy and as long a recovery time. Incision is either glued and steri-stripped or sutured. Still recommended for tumors with a high likelihood of benign status and small enough that surgeons believe they can get clear margins on the first try. All biopsies except fine-needle can result in a seroma filling the area where the tissue was removed--nature abhors a vacuum and fills the empty space with fluid. A core-needle biopsy can produce a tiny one, and an excisional one as big as that from a lumpectomy",

He said from measurements that it doesn\u2019t appear I have arm LE (the diff. bet. R & L is attributable to my being a \u201crightie\u201d); but from symptoms I described (finger swelling during a couple of 8-hr flights while wearing the compression stuff, arm stiffness and fullness while at >1 mi. high in Taormina, Sicily, and forearm soreness and a palpable knot for a few weeks before & during my trip upon extension & rotation--the latter indicative of mild temporary cording) he diagnosed pre-clinical LE so that Medicare would pay for my PT sessions and my supplement would cover some of the co-pay for the glove he prescribed in lieu of the gauntlet. He also said my giant breast seroma is just a seroma, aggravated by radiation. I had 2 sentinel nodes and 2 \u201ctag-along\u201d nodes biopsied, all negative and none w/in the radiation field. Had my first LE therapy session today, during which I was taught MLD for both arm and breast--even though the seroma is not LE, it is still lymph fluid which might be \u201ctrained\u201d to drain away gradually and reduce the seroma to manageable proportions (unfortunately, I was also ordered to replace my bras with ones a band and a cup size bigger, to ease pressure on the tissues--and to keep wearing bras or support camis for sleep. I noticed a small painless bruise on my forearm, in the same spot as the prior cording symptoms, though I don\u2019t recall bumping or otherwise injuring the forearm. The LE therapist says that\u2019s usually a souvenir of cording having suddenly resolved itself--some patients feel a \u201cpopping\u201d though I didn\u2019t. She also told me to do MLD on both sides, since part of the goal is to shift fluid to the \u201cgood\u201d (i.e., non-surgical) side for eventual excretion--and my groin as well as upper & lower abs, which might be almost as much fluid as fat.",

First, she showed me both the screening and diagnostic mammos so I could see where what was called the \u201cfocal asymmetry\u201d was and what it looked like on digital film--it was white, small and irregular but w/o spiculations (i.e. those \u201ctentacles\u201d). She guesstimated the size as 7mm. Then she moved the probe over that area of my breast and turned the monitor so I could see it. The blob was black and shaped like a jellybean--seemed wider than it was tall, which she said could be a good sign. Then she demonstrated that when she pressed down on the part of the breast where the blob was, nothing happened. It wouldn\u2019t squish (which I already knew a cyst would have done), nor did it move or change shape. I said a four-letter word (synonymous with \u201cpoop\u201d), and she didn\u2019t correct me--just said, \u201cI think we really need to biopsy this.\u201d She went on to describe the procedure, but also said that I couldn\u2019t have it that day since there were certain meds (baby aspirin, Celebrex, fish oil) I needed to be off for 3-5 days. And I had a 2-week trip starting the next morning. I asked if I could wait 2 weeks, and she said it wasn\u2019t likely to grow in that short a time--if it were, she said she\u2019d have done the biopsy right then and there and monitored me for excessive bleeding. So I scheduled the biopsy and had it upon my return. Reason I\u2019m telling you this is that there seems to be a very wide gap between how some facilities and care teams treat their patients. Mine treated me with respect for my intelligence as someone who needed to know. That\u2019s because since I was at a specialty breast health center, I had a radiologist interpreting the mammogram and doing and interpreting the ultrasound right then and there. I would have been an absolute basket case had I been made to wait even overnight to find out whether I needed a biopsy. I got my biopsy results and diagnosis the evening of the very next day. (And my 6-mo. post-op followup diagnostic mammo was read and interpreted while I waited, before even getting dressed). In your pocket, as we say here, that you find out ASAP if you need a biopsy; that you won\u2019t need a biopsy; and that if you do need one, the findings will be benign (as 80% are) and you get your results ASAP. But if it doesn\u2019t end there, I\u2019d urge you if at all possible to seek treatment at a larger facility with an on-site radiologist willing to give you his or her observations.",

A nuclear bone scan (with a radioactive isotope injection) is sometimes done to check for metastasis (which would alter treatment) or to see if bone pain is caused instead by injury, inflammation or osteoporosis instead of by metastasis. A few years back when I had hipbone pain and an avulsion fracture of the iliac crest w/o having fallen or hit something, but was too young for osteoporosis, a nuclear bone scan was done to rule out bone cancer--it showed inflammation from a bone harvest that had been performed at that site 8 yrs earlier to repair a tibial plateau fracture.",

At the very least, you should have the option of choosing a surgeon and knowing what his or her approach to the mastectomy will be. And LisaAlissa is correct, in that more and more these days chemo is done before surgery for tumors that would otherwise be too big to make lumpectomy practical.

Life is fraught with far greater uncertainties than that! It sounds like you are trying to control for every eventuality--and I strongly suspect that a needle biopsy confirming it's benign might still not definitively reassure you and you might end up demanding an excisional biopsy. Granted, a core-needle biopsy is not major surgery and is a relatively minor procedure with little downtime. But it's not like an ultrasound either--it's invasive, there could be complications and some pain, it might carry a slight risk of error, and it almost certainly would be expensive (and probably not covered by your insurance). \"BIRADS 3\" is something for which nearly all of us here would have given our eyeteeth. I am in agreement with those who urge you to go with the advice of an expert like your radiologist who knows what cancers feel, look, and behave like on ultrasound, not your PCP who is not skilled at that. You have a long life ahead of you, with crises almost certainly in the offing. Why go looking for a forest fire when all you can smell is a BBQ? Do you get a MRSA test every time you get a paper cut or hangnail? Do you automatically think \u201cZika\" or \"West Nile\" with every mosquito bite?

At first I thought you were unnecessarily anxious, but that there\u2019s no real harm in getting the biopsy done in order to keep you from worrying for 6 months. But now you\u2019re worrying about something as trivial and harmless as the titanium clip! I hate to make you even more anxious, but once the biopsy comes back benign and you\u2019re advised to re-check in another 6-12 months, I suspect you will keep worrying (\u201cwhat if the pathologist was wrong, what if they missed the part of the tumor that might have cancer, etc. etc.\u201d). If you mistrust a benign biopsy result and insist on excision, you will worry yourself sick waiting for those results--and if they\u2019re benign, you\u2019ll probably still be waiting for the other shoe to drop. Trust me, it never ends--no matter the results. Look, the fact is that life\u2019ll kill ya. (I stole that from Warren Zevon). You could get hit by a bus. You could get shot as an innocent bystander in a gang-banger drive-by. You could choke on something with nobody to Heimlich you. You could get stung by a swarm of bees, carried away by a tornado, struck by lightning, catch a drug-resistant bug, You could fall down a flight of stairs and fracture your skull or spine. But no sane person twists their guts into knots worrying about those things. The chance your biopsy comes back anything other than benign is almost as remote--and the chance of anything going wrong by getting a titanium clip is nonexistent. Being in the health professions carries the real danger of white-coat hypochondria. In my husband\u2019s second year of medical school, he and all his classmates kept imagining the sound of hoofbeats and went looking for zebras--and were convinced they had symptoms of every disease they studied. It was ridiculous, and they eventually got back to reality and on with their lives. An example is one day years ago when I was going for my physical and booster shots. Before my primary care doc came in, the resident assigned to take my vitals & basic h & p looked at my toes and said they looked sort of purple--and asked me, \u201cThere\u2019s a disease called lupus, you\u2019re the right age for the highest risk of it, and I think you should ask your doctor to order an l.e. prep test.\u201d My doc came in, I told her what the resident said. She looked at the thermostat in the room--it read 61 degrees. \u201cYour toes are purple because you\u2019re cold. I\u2019m cold. But we won\u2019t be for long,\u201d she said, as she adjusted the air conditioner control. The she mentioned hoofbeats & zebras. (You can probably guess I never got lupus). There are SO many REAL dangers in life to worry about--and eventually (unless you\u2019re suddenly struck dead in your prime by a meteorite or runaway train), you will be old enough to encounter them. Then you will look back and beat yourself up for wasting the best and healthiest years of your life worrying unnexessarily.",

ADH is sort of a cancer-precursor: the cells within the duct are atypical but unlike DCIS they are not cancerous--though they signal your breast is capable of producing a malignancy in the future. Usually ADHs are removed by excisional biopsy--for all intents & purposes a lumpectomy without node biopsy (unless the path report comes back with some ductal carcinoma, either in situ or invasive). Anti-estrogen drugs are also usually given prophylactically--and raloxifene has an actually welcome side effect of preventing or reversing bone loss. (It\u2019s usually not given to postmenopausal women unless at risk for cancer). Mastectomy is usually an extreme solution for ADH, unless there is already cancer in the other breast, you have a strong family history, or a genetic mutation that carries a high risk of breast and/or gynecological cancers. If, like Ddw, you have one or more of those three factors present, I would discuss getting genetic counseling with your doctor in order to assess just how elevated your risk is and whether prophylactic mastectomy makes sense.",

Avoid irritating seams (clip off & tape over any nylon thread that might stick out) and stiff lace trim. Be prepared for some limited mobility (you probably won\u2019t have any, but it\u2019s good to have a plan). Wear shirts or blouses that button or zip up the front or you can step into. Amoena makes some great camisoles--zip-front with removable \u201cfoobs\u201d for mastectomy patients, or step-in with padded shelf bra (with slots to slip in foobs if you need, or light support if you don\u2019t) in a rainbow of colors. So they can double as tanks or shells under an open shirt or jacket. Pricey, but after you\u2019re done with treatment they make great tankini swimsuit tops. If you had lumpectomy and are D cup or smaller, step-in Genie or Coobie bras are great. If you\u2019re bigger, Leading Lady makes front-close leisure/sleep bras in a variety of colors (even animal print) that don\u2019t support a whole lot but are better than \u201cflapping in the breeze.\u201d They come in sizes up to 46F/G/H. (BareNecessities.com and HerRoom.com sell them, as does Roaman\u2019s/Woman Within for the plus sizes). One thing you want to avoid is skin-on-skin contact--you don\u2019t want the underside of your radiated breast touching your midriff, and you want to pad where the elastic bottom band of your bra contacts the crease of your bust. Some women simply take a well-worn, washed-till-soft piece of T-shirt material and tuck it beneath your breast.   ",

You're closer to Pullman or Spokane than you are to Seattle, right? Does WSU in Pullman have a teaching hospital? Is there a specialty cancer center (better yet, one with a breast center) in Spokane? What about Boise or Moscow (U of I), ID? (is Walla Walla equidistant between there and Seattle)? The flak you're getting is typical of a general hospital, general surgeon, and general radiologist. If you can't find a good breast and/or cancer center in eastern or central WA or ID, IMHO it's worth the trip to Seattle for UW Hospital or the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (which when my DH called \u201cthe Hutch\" when he was in med. school at UW back when we lived in Seattle). You can have your adjuvant treatment closer to home, but the surgery should be by a breast cancer surgeon (with reconstruction, if necessary, done not just by a breast plastic surgeon but one specializing in reconstruction in breast-cancer patients) and the biopsy done as minimally-invasively as possible by a breast radiologist. Hate to sound cynical, but it's an established fact that the smaller and more rural the town and the less likely it is to have breast specialists, the higher the likelihood of more-invasive diagnostic and surgical procedures--especially when the surgeon's livelihood is at stake. When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. If your surgeon is talking about a 15% chance of malignancy, with that malignancy being DCIS, having what is in effect dual lumpectomies just to diagnose it is outrageous--and if he's talking excisional biopsies possibly followed by full-fledged lumpectomies, I swear I hear cash registers ringing. What to say? Be gentle but firm: it's YOUR life at stake, and no offense, but you'd prefer the most specialized and up-to-date diagnostic care you can afford. Especially if you want to be out of commission for as short a time as possible during the diagnostic process.

My friend was originally scheduled for lumpectomy & radiation for DCIS, but another larger area showed up via MRI in another part of the breast--so she\u2019s opting instead for bilateral mastectomy. But since your tumor is grade 1 and hormone+/HER2-, that\u2019s a good sign.",

There is a saying in the law biz that one should think of one's opposing counsel as a genius but the judge as an idiot--meaning that the judge needs to have every fact spelled out and every possible legal argument suggested to him or her. Same with the bean counters: every denial needs to be met with solid medical reasons (backed up by one's doctors) as to why the denial is bullshit. The clip-placement mammo is a textbook case, especially since it is now the universal standard of care.",

Check Travelsmith, Magellan and the travel-supplies aisle of Target. Brithael, I hear you about boob-barricading. Both my kitties seemed to make a beeline for the operated side of my chest. I was very thankful for my P3 (Protective Pillow Purse) that my BS' nurse gave me from Protect The Girls (alas, they have neither a website nor a FB page). You might want to inquire whether U. of C. participates in that, or whether it's just N.Side. I took mine along when I drove to IA City a month post-op in order to cushion my breast from the seatbelt and rest my right elbow when driving; when I arrived at the hotel, I brought it upstairs to use while sleeping, before I realized there'd be no cats to jump on my chest! Home now until Dec., I might want to use it again, now that 2 wks of rads have created Teenage Mutant Ninja Tit (the skin's still fine, but the breast is swollen and somewhat tender). I also got a handout for post-op suppliers: bras, camis, lymphedema sleeves (fill your 'scrip for one soon if you expect to be traveling by air or hitting the gym), etc. I didn\u2019t want to go all the way up to Schwartz\u2019 in Highland Park, especially since they\u2019re a general lingerie/swimwear store with a breast-cancer-supplies dept. Instead I went to Second Act in Lakeview--they sell ONLY breast cancer apparel and supplies. Got some compression camis with shelf-bras in case my breast would be too irritated for my bras, as well as my lymphedema sleeve & gauntlet. (They carry no bras larger than DDD, however). They also have wigs, but I think Chrysalis Hair in Roscoe Village has a wider selection as well as experienced stylists. (They serve only patients with cancer-treatment-related--chemo or AI--hair loss). Unfortunately, all the stores on the handout are located in the north & NW suburbs.",

First, this is a Stage III thread\u2014and from your description your cancer, being so early, is likely no more advanced than a Stage IA. And the part about it being a \u201ccollection of cells\" suggests it might even be DCIS, which is Stage 0. You should know that DCIS (which is not an invasive cancer) is often Grade 3, more so than is invasive ductal carcinoma. Stage and grade are two very different things! So you should probably move your post\u2014and future posts\u2014to the Stage I or even DCIS threads. Say a temporary adios to your surgeon (temporary because you'll have to see her or her NP a couple of times a year for the next two years) and turn your attention towards getting a medical oncologist (MO), who will be overseeing any further therapy beyond radiation should it be recommended (and that doc would be a radiation oncologist, or RO). Your MO will basically be your \u201cteam captain\" for the next few years. Some centers even have \u201cnurse navigators,\" who can steer you through the system and the process(es) of treatment. At any rate, have either the nurse navigator or the MO fully explain the path report to you. It'd help if you could post it here (black out names & contact info, of course), so those of us for whom this ain't our first rodeo can help you know what you're dealing with. Once we know, we can tell you how to post that info in your Profile, so that for all future posts we, your BCO sisters, can guide you. I suggest you surf on over to the Lumpectomy Lounge thread, introduce yourself and tell your story, and take comfort in the help & guidance we will give you.",

I just finished the last of my 16 partial-breast (lumpectomy-cavity) treatments today. My cavity seroma enlarged, my breast was occasionally sore (from the inside) and my nipple is sensitive, and the color of the irradiated skin is pinky-tan. But I had no peeling, itching, blistering, ulceration or even irritated skin. Each time, I immediately slathered on Aquaphor in the dressing cubicle before I got dressed again post-treatment, and used either pure aloe vera gel (no alcohol or fragrance, purchased at the cancer center's pharmacy) or calendula cream every night (twice daily on weekends). Because I was told to have totally bare skin for 4 hours before each treatment, I showered off the previous night's stuff each morning before getting dressed. I had a rather unusual situation, though--my SNB incision (in fact, my entire armpit) was outside the radiation field. I didn't know this before I began treatments (and I was given the same printed handouts as women undergoing longer whole-breast radiation), so I laid in a supply of cornstarch baby powder and nonmetallic deodorant (Tom's of Maine) beforehand.

I am far comfier sleeping and lounging in those leisure bras (and maybe those camis) beneath my nighties, PJs or sweats than I am going braless. Word to the wise (wide?)--I had to buy the largest cup size, 40F/G/H, which is still a cup size or two too small. I'd been warned to avoid skin-to-skin contact but I had no irritation--and no reddening--beneath my breast, either.

Because a bunch of prigs decided to impose their belief upon everybody that pain is natural and something that needs to be endured, that it is spiritually desirable to offer up your suffering, and that it is immoral to try to avoid or keep it at bay regardless of its cause, we have kids in small towns, soccer moms and farmers shooting up\u2026and dying.

Second, if your MO will not sign your MMJ card application, and MJ relieves your pain (for me, it only made me high and set off coughing fits that led to asthma attacks), your local MMJ dispensary can refer you to a physician who specializes in facilitating application for an MMJ card.

The one in my \u2018hood told me that if I ever need it for pain relief before metastasis\u2014either Stage IV or chemo-induced cachexia are the only reasons my MO will sign an application\u2014they have several doctors who are willing to sign an app. for anyone with a valid proven diagnosis of the qualifying conditions in IL\u2014of which cancer at any stage is one).",

You didn\u2019t specify why you can\u2019t go to a specialty breast cancer center. If distance or expense is a consideration, there are charities that provide free or greatly reduced-cost transportation (including air) and even lodging for your family or caregiving friends. There are plenty of women on these threads who thought they were stuck with their local healthcare providers but were able--despite distance and insufficient financial resources--to get at least their initial care (surgery) at places like Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Dana Farber, M.D. Anderson and Johns Hopkins. You have a tiny tumor that at Grade 1 is sometimes described as \u201cindolent.\u201d Without doing an OncotypeDX there is NO reason to assume chemo would be advisable. And there are breast cancer surgeons who can do a lumpectomy even with the tumor in an inhospitable location--and oncoplastic breast surgeons who can take over to give you symmetry as well. Your surgeon\u2019s assumption that your breast would \u201ccave in\u201d is also rash and unwarranted. Your tumor is 6mm. My friend had 6 cm (that\u2019s ten times as big) of Grade 3 DCIS, behind her nipple, and was given the choice of lumpectomy+radiation or mastectomy. (She chose a bilateral mastectomy for personal reasons). If your surgeon is a general surgeon, run--do not walk--to a different hospital STAT! General surgeons--especially older ones--tend to be territorial (many will recommend an excisional biopsy so they can get the fee, rather than refer the patient to a breast radiologist who can do a core biopsy) and set in their ways (they were trained to do mastectomies and are not about to change.....and would probably charge more for one). A mastectomy almost always requires at least a 1, if not 2-day hospital stay, with more time spent under general anesthesia, higher risk of complications (and if you add reconstruction to that, an even longer recovery). That\u2019s not to say you should never have mastectomy with or w/o reconstruction, but you should be given an informed choice--and your surgeon is incorrectly or incompletely informing you. General surgeons are great for abdominal surgeries like appendectomies, hysterectomies, colon resections, hernia repairs and the like. I wouldn\u2019t entrust my breasts to one......and I count several among our friends. You wouldn\u2019t hire a probate lawyer to defend a DUI. You want someone who does breast cancer surgery (all types) and nothing but---and does several per week and has several hundred under her or his belt. And if you need reconstruction, you need an oncoplastic breast surgeon--not a plastic surgeon who does mostly augmentations & lifts.",

I am normally (abnormally?) a 38I or 40H. Before the surgery, my right breast was slightly smaller and higher, but I didn\u2019t really need to pad that cup unless I wanted absolute symmetry (used the removable pads from a too-small Genie bra). I have my last rad treatment coming up this aft., and the right breast is now MUCH larger but still sits higher, thanks to the seroma occupying the tumor cavity. I now have to wear 38J or 40K. The seroma compresses more than does pure fat, so both breasts look almost the same when I\u2019m dressed (you can see my cleavage skew slightly to the left when I\u2019m in my underwear, a shelf-cami or a swimsuit). Point is, I don\u2019t know how long I will have that seroma, and when it resorbs how much of it will be replaced by scar tissue. Another consideration is that even though my left breast showed no anomalies on my recent screening mammo (the one that first spotted my right breast tumor), it isn\u2019t a given that it will always remain that way. No point in trying to even things up yet---or ever. Who knows whether my right one will stay larger or shrink? But the thing about your story that I found most disturbing was that your surgeon wanted to optimize cosmetic results before your full pathology report was in--frozen sections aren\u2019t always accurate as to the extent of margins. Having to go back in to achieve clean margins is not uncommon, and in that case you\u2019d need further surgery on both breasts to achieve symmetry. I opted for lumpectomy not just because it was available to me, but also that I was unwilling to go through the longer surgery & recovery period of mastectomy--especially the added complications, regardless of reconstruction or corrective mastipexy/reduction on the healthy breast.",

Uncertainty drives me batty, in all aspects of life: will I be able to park when I get there; will the roads or sidewalks be icy; will I have drawn enough of a crowd for the venue to book me again; will I get a tax refund or have to pay extra this year, and if so how much; will I have enough time between scenes in the show to change costumes and get miked; will the pipes freeze; will my car start; do I have enough gas to get to the next filling station on this country road; yada yada yada... Proof of that is how I felt when I got that first dicey mammo result \"BIRADS 0;\" then when the radiologist suggested a biopsy; then in the 10 days I was on the road and the thought \"it might be cancer; what if it's cancer; am I going to die; OMG, it's BIRADS 4B, I'm sure it's cancer; what if it's triple-neg or Stage IV?\" kept running in my head in an endless loop, like a drunken yet manic rabbit caroming off the walls of the rabbit hole, wrecking any enjoyment I had in the off-hours from my continuing legal ed course and coffeehouse gigs. Oh, sure, that fateful phone call the day after my biopsy with the words \"invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2, hormone-positive\" was initially a punch to the solar plexus--but after I hung up, I felt strangely relieved: I knew what I was facing and I was in control of what I would do next. Fear gave way to determination to learn all I could and be confident in the choices to be made. Of course, there was still uncertainty about margins, lymph nodes and whether I'd need chemo; but when the path report and Oncotype score came back, I could see the \"paving stones of the road ahead\" fall into place and my apprehension fell away like the air in a leaking balloon. As to valerian root, I'm still not sure if it's okay. MtWoman, you're triple-neg, so it's safe for you and many other women on this thread. I'm Luminal A, on letrozole. I have a scrip for Xanax (1/4-1/2mg for sleep), but I no longer wish to take it. Wine, even in the tiny amount (1-2 oz) that comes out of my Coravin, seems to wake me up during the night. CBD oil helps somewhat, especially when supplemented by 1/8 of a 25mg. indica THC gummy (finally got my MMJ card); but it would be really nice to be able go back to the valerian that always helped me pre-bc when I would awaken in the night & not fall back asleep. (The alternative is Lyrica, which I got after weird neuropathy after my first Zometa infusion--but it makes me oversleep and then be loopy half the day; I take one maybe every 2-3 weeks, and have no idea how people function taking it 2-3x a day as the label directs). Both valerian and Lyrica drop me like a plugged buffalo, but the valerian's nearly instantaneous whereas Lyrica does nothing for 2 hrs and then hits me like a ton of bricks. MSK's site doesn't say valerian's contradicted for ER+ patients, whether on an AI or tamoxifen; but I hear anecdotal reports that people's MOs advise against it, though with no reliable specific scholarly citations either way.",

No doubt your surgeon has already touched base behind the scenes with at least one medical and one radiological oncologist. With an OncotypeDX of 17 (still \u201clow-risk\" for recurrence), normally it would be highly unlikely that chemo would be recommended unless you are quite young (30s or early 40s). But with 4 positive nodes, you're \u201con the fence\" (and if the OncotypeDX test was delayed until after the ALND, that fourth node would have disqualified you for the test). Perhaps a MammaPrint or Prosigna test, both of which have \u201chigh\" vs. \u201clow\" risk results (no gray areas) would prove helpful. I hope BarredOwl can weigh in here\u2014there are \u201cdueling studies,\" some concluding that clinical factors (including tumor size, grade, # of positive nodes, hormone receptor/HER2 status) outweigh genomic testing (OncotypeDX, MammaPrint, Prosigna), but others contending vice versa. The primary determinant of whether chemo would be sufficiently effective for its benefits to outweigh its risks is how rapidly your tumor cells divide (mitotic rate), because chemo kills only rapidly-dividing cells (whether tumor or normal ones like hair follicles, mucous membranes, bone marrow, etc.). Slowly-dividing tumor cells would not be affected, but your rapidly-dividing normal cells would. The fact that you're on tamoxifen and not an aromatase inhibitor tells me you're probably not yet menopausal, so your relative youth might mean that your tumor is more aggressive than it would be in a postmenopausal woman with an identical score. (Had I been diagnosed at 54, not yet in menopause, with the same OncotypeDX of 16 as I was at 64, I might have considered chemo. And had I been 44, I definitely would have considered and probably agreed to it). If you were to get chemo, your Tamoxifen would likely be suspended, as taking both simultaneously would be very rough on your body. Some MOs advise patients able to skip chemo and go straight to radiation to wait till after radiation is over (and you begin to heal from it) before you start endocrine therapy. Some here do rads & endocrine therapy simultaneously\u2014but not chemo & endocrine, or chemo & rads, simultaneously. If I were you, I'd get at least two opinions from MOs\u2014not because you wouldn't trust your MO, but because you'd want to see if his/her assessment is an \u201coutlier.\" If they say the opposite things, maybe (if you can afford it), a third as a tie-breaker? Chemo vs. no chemo decision is the province of an MO, not an RO or surgeon (though the latter two might be able to accurately speculate, especially if they're on your \u201ctumor board\"). Difficult situation, and we are \u201cin your pocket\" as we say here for whatever results and recommendations you get.",

Better yet, ditch the regular or two-wheeled suitcases and get 4-or-8-wheel spinners instead. They practically propel themselves, whereas the 2-wheelers have to be pulled and set off arm swelling from the exertion. I will tell you that at my pre-op \u201cteaching session,\" the BS' nurse measured me for and gave me an Rx for a sleeve and gauntlet. She said that even if I didn't have symptoms I must wear them for all long flights (>4hr), don them an hour before takeoff and remove them an hour after landing (unless the destination was over 1 mi. high, in which case to keep them on a bit longer and check to see if the elevation caused any swelling). I too had 4 nodes out via SNB, and got some mild non-visible cording symptoms starting a week post-rads. Made an appt. to see an LE specialist a month away. I took a Mediterranean cruise a couple of weeks after that. The first flight leg to Europe was 8 hr, so I put on the compression stuff an hour before boarding. Second leg was only an hour--and had I known we'd have a 2-hr layover in Amsterdam I'd have taken them off before boarding the next flight. When we checked into our hotel in Rome, I took them off. I noticed a little tightness in my bicep after a couple of hrs. on a shore excursion in Sicily to a town 1.5 mi. high near Mt. Etna, but it eased immediately as our bus began to descend back towards the port. On the return, from Barcelona to Amsterdam I didn't wear the compression but put it on as soon as we landed for the 8+ transatlantic leg. Took it off an hour after landing in Detroit and kept it off for the last short hop to Chicago. On the Amsterdam-Detroit flight, I noticed my rings were tight--but it could have been due to very high-sodium airplane meals & snacks. When I saw the LE specialist (a nationally-recognized pioneer in the disease and co-founder of LANA), my cording had resolved and he hit the ceiling when I showed him my sleeve and gauntlet. \u201cI never prescribe compression for patients who had only 4 nodes removed.\" But when I told him about the finger swelling in flight, he changed his tune and told me to get a glove for flight instead of a gauntlet. He measured me and found no difference from my pre-op measurements, but staged me as 0 because I had claimed symptoms, and that was the only way Medicare would pay for LE therapy. Good thing, because I eventually did get visible axillary cording and am now definitely at stage 1 LE. I wear compression during exercise (including guitar playing and long sessions of housework or cooking) and if there's a front coming through. For short periods, such as workouts and guitar, I can use the gauntlet. But if my rings get tight and self-drainage massage doesn't help, I put on the glove as well until my rings get loose. And for my next trip this month (London, Lausanne, Paris) I will wear sleeve and glove on the transatlantic legs, and while in Switzerland if I\u2019m spending much time at Alpine level (Lausanne has a wide variation in altitude). I will wear sleeve and gauntlet. I won\u2019t wear it on the 2.5-hr London-Geneva flight, and probably won\u2019t need it on the Lausanne-Paris TGV train because the entire run will be at lower elevations. Most boutiques that sell compression have at least the Jobst or Juzo in stock, in standard sizes. If your measurements indicate you'll need a custom set (and the fitter confirms that), better get the order in ASAP. Be prepared to pay several times as much as for an off-the-shelf sleeve. Wearing a sleeve that is too loose is flushing your money down the toilet; too tight is much worse than no compression at all. Well-fitting compression can't hurt you or trigger LE. Confirm that you can fit into a plain off-the-shelf Juzo or Jobst before you mail-order from LympheDivas. Don't forget to consider your arm length and upper arm circumference, since Juzo does have an extra-wide-band option, and LympheDivas have Short and Long --no \u201cregular\"--sizes. Too short and too long can cause constrictions--the latter by rolling down--which are harmful. And if you need a glove, call LympheDivas with your finger length measurements, because their gloves run long in the fingers. Normally, that wouldn't be a problem, but my fingers are so short relative to my palms (alas, I have Donald Trump hands) that my fingertips are completely covered (up to the nail tips) in their gloves so I can't work a touchpad and the fabric mutes my guitar strings. Their gauntlets are fine, though. And whatever brand you buy, make sure it has a silicone gripper band to keep it from rolling down and cutting off circulation in your upper arm. ",

Not all insurance will cover even therapeutic level compression--and some vendors won't take your insurance. Alas, neither Medicare nor supplement policies do, which is one of the reasons why the Lymphedema Treatment Act has such broad bipartisan support in both houses of Congress. (Unfortunately, the majority's leadership is holding it hostage as a pawn for repealing the ACA or de-funding Planned Parenthood....end of political rant). As long as you are wearing compression that is properly fitted to your measurements, and wear hand protection (proper size gauntlet or glove), it won't cause LE...it might or might not prevent it, though. And my LE therapist says compression or no, you should still move your arms a lot (fist pumps, hand waving--apologize to the flight attendants in advance), drink water and go to the loo a lot, and move about the plane as much as they\u2019ll let you. If any adjacent passengers complain about your hand gestures, there\u2019s a one-fingered one that if done repeatedly can get that fluid moving......",

The \u201cinfiltrative cancer\u201d is what they suspected it might have been, but more likely simply what they were looking for. \u201cICD 10\u201d is the current (as of 2015) national standard system of billing coding for insurance &/or Medicare reimbursement, and in order to get coverage for a procedure, they have to say what the procedure is seeking to diagnose, using the proper specific diagnostic \u201ccode\"--hence the \u201ccode N63\u201d (anyone here who does billing coding, I\u2019d appreciate clarification). It doesn\u2019t mean that is the actual diagnosis, but rather the suspected diagnosis--without that, there\u2019s a chance that they would not be reimbursed. \u201cInflitrative,\u201d synonym for \u201cinvasive,\u201d means that they weren\u2019t looking for a tumor in situ, e.g., DCIS--they expected that were they to find something it would be invasive (more common, BTW, than in situ). 2. The DNA analysis does not test for \u201cthe breast cancer gene\u201d (which is a misnomer anyway--the correct terminology would be \u201cgenetic mutation,\u201d which is a defect in a gene that causes cells to keep dividing and form a tumor, instead of dying off at the end of their lifespan like normal cells do). If by \u201cbreast cancer gene\u201d you mean such a mutation (e.g., of the BRCA-1 or -2, CHEK 2, PALB 2, etc. genes), that is done by taking a blood sample (sometimes saliva sample if you can\u2019t give a blood sample or you can produce copious saliva uncontaminated by other stuff in your mouth), because those genes--and their mutations--are evident in all your cells and the blood is the most reliable way to test for them. It is done independently of biopsy, after a genetic counseling session--and usually only if there is a reason such as a close family history of breast or related cancer, other family members who tested positive for such a mutation, or a pre-existing breast cancer diagnosis coupled with an ethnicity (e.g., Ashkenazi Jewish) in which such a mutation occurs more frequently than in the general population. The \"DNA analysis\" the report mentioned is to analyze the biopsy sample itself to determine the nature of the tumor cells, which is another measure besides appearance to distinguish benign from malignant. 3. The findings say \u201cbenign\u201d because even though they were looking for invasive cancer, cancer isn\u2019t what they found. (That doesn\u2019t mean they expected to find it, but rather, as in 1 above, they had to say that\u2019s what they were looking for in order for the tests & procedure to be covered). 4. My core needle biopsy was quick, painless and easy. The radiologist (not the same one who did the diagnostic ultrasound that revealed the mass) used the diagnostic film as a guide as to where to put the probe, found the mass and hit her mark right away. She specializes in breasts (as did the diagnostic radiologist) and nothing but, and it was in the Center For Breast Health of the hospital which also has Kellogg Cancer Center. Sorry your experience was not as good. 5. The mass was bigger than the core samples, and removing it would have been a surgical procedure. Even minor surgery carries risks (anesthesia, infection, clotting, pain, etc.), so diagnostic procedures tend to be as minimally-invasive as possible. No need to put you through the equivalent of a lumpectomy only to find you don\u2019t have cancer. 6. Tumor measurements usually include the whole enchilada, including the \u201cspider legs;\u201d but another reason to do just a core needle biopsy rather than a surgical excisional biopsy--because were they to remove the entire tumor, they\u2019d have needed to take a wider margin to make sure that they got it all. 7. What you should expect from the BS depends on the BS\u2019 preferences. You would probably receive an explanation of the results and his/her opinion about what if anything to do about them--most likely, confirmation that periodic non-invasive diagnostic surveillance is advisable. It would also depend on how much faith the BS (and perhaps the MO who disagreed with the radiologist) has in the pathologist who examined the core biopsy samples; it\u2019s possible that the BS might suggest a second opinion (rather than putting you through another biopsy) from another pathologist or lab, using the samples already taken. MOs don\u2019t usually call the shots about whether a tumor is or isn\u2019t malignant, but rather how to treat it once it\u2019s removed and confirmed to be cancer. A good way to go would be to get an opinion from a facility that actually has a \u201ctumor board\u201d of surgeons, MOs and pathologists--and perhaps this BS is part of such a facility. If not, request such a second opinion that has such a board.",

And unlike DCIS, which can often be multifocal, high grade and so diffuse that removing it via multiple lumpectomies might be logistically impossible, a \"small area of abnormality\" diagnosed as LCIS is easy to remove without impacting your health & well-being. A \"prophylactic mastectomy\" for it--absent strong family history and/or genetic mutation--is like getting a double amputation because your dermatologist found & removed a small basal cell skin cancer on one leg. Putting yourself through such a major & irreversible surgery with very real risks and side effects (anesthesia risks, pain, drains, infections, seromas) is major overkill and might impact your QOL in the prime of your life more than you realize. Reconstruction is the \"gift that keeps on giving,\" especially when it requires tissue expanders, multiple fills, and a second swap-out surgery for the implants. (And a flap recon is a very long & delicate surgery with its own set of risks, not the least of which is duration under general anesthesia, not to mention complications, scarring & pain at the donor--back or abdomen--site). Symmetry, even acceptable cosmesis (appearance), is not guaranteed. Don't get me wrong--sometimes these drastic surgeries are necessary in the case of invasive ductal or lobular cancer (or even diffuse high-grade multifocal DCIS), and the risks & complications are worth it if your life is at stake. Many of us with small enough & conveniently located IDC opted for just lumpectomy, But your little LCIS tumor isn't worth taking the risk and--frankly--wasting your good health and quality of life at this point in time. If you must do something, get the LCIS excised and thank your lucky stars it's not invasive cancer. It's extremely unlikely to recur. As the old blues song goes, \"don't go looking for trouble: trouble will find you.\"",

Your 10-year risk, however, is only 1.1%. That should tell you something. The average woman has a lifetime risk of 1 in 8--and the average age at diagnosis is 61. That being said, I was diagnosed at 64. But let\u2019s also address the risk of \u201cbreast cancer.\u201d Not all breast cancers are alike. 70-80% of breast cancers diagnosed after menopause are invasive ductal, and of a type (hormone-positive/HER2-negative) that is often treatable much less aggressively--lumpectomy, radiation, anti-hormonals, usually no chemo. And the \u201ccancer\u201d they\u2019re talking about might, in your case, be DCIS, which by definition doesn\u2019t metastasize. If I were in your shoes I'd get tested (if at all possible) for other genetic mutations such as Chek2 or PALB2--heck, I had no family history but simply by virtue of my ethnicity and having a bc diagnosis I was tested for the BRCA 1 & 2 mutations as well as the first two. At your young age, you might be able to get it done free as part of a study. (Or you might get a second opinion from a doctor who doesn\u2019t refuse to have you tested). As to whether to go for a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy, only you can tell if that\u2019s right for you psychologically. Some women feel it\u2019s like a sword hanging over their heads and want to totally foreclose the possibility by getting a bmx (but bear in mind cancer can still develop in the axilla, chest wall, etc.). IMHO, it\u2019s sort of like dealing with a disastrous family cardiovascular history by getting all your coronary arteries prophylactically stented. Remember that once your breast is gone, there\u2019s no going back. No matter how nice a reconstruction may look, it will never feel like a real breast and cannot nurse a baby. I would ask your doctors for the intermediate risk predictions, between the 10-year and lifetime milestones--sometimes looking at a curve can give you a better picture. I would definitely err on the side of being as minimally invasive as possible, so long as your 10 year risk remains that low and you are contemplating having children.",

You might even be a candidate for the shorter partial-breast protocol. If the surgical path report confirms it\u2019s under 1 cm and your nodes are clear, then they usually don\u2019t even order an OncotypeDX test, as you\u2019d be extremely unlikely to have the kind of fast-growing cancer cells that would respond to chemo. After your radiation, you\u2019d be offered endocrine therapy to reduce the estrogen in your body, cutting off any remaining cells\u2019 access to it. At 60, you\u2019re postmenopausal, so that would be an aromatase inhibitor (1 tiny pill/day for 5-10 yrs) rather than tamoxifen. Even without functioning ovaries, your fat cells and adrenal glands make an androgen which aromatase (secreted by your liver) converts into estrogen.

This isn\u2019t really relevant for most of us, who have DCIS, \"garden-variety\" IDC or ILC, but interesting nonetheless. Barred Owl, impressions?",

But that's an average, As it goes from 4a (\"possibly suspicious\") to 4b (\"suspicious\"), 4c (\"highly suspicious\") and 5, the chances of malignancy go up. But not even BIRADS 5, while \"very likely malignant\" according to signs seen on imaging, has a 100% chance of being malignant. You are one of the lucky few whose tumor beat the odds. \"Stromal\" cells are connective tissue, and \"fibrosis\" is thickening &/or hardening. So on imaging it can look irregular and even \"spiculated\" (spiky border) and fool a radiologist because it looks like most malignant tumors, but only a sample of the tissue can be conclusive because malignancy is determined by analyzing the properties, behavior & composition of the actual tumor cells--which can be determined only pathologically under the microscope. Let's break down what your biopsy report says and why you can (and should) take a deep breath and calm down. Your sample has some thickened connective tissue cells (\"stromal\" fibrosis) which do not appear active. \"Hyperplasia\" means an over-growth of cells (i.e., more than a normal amount, usually two layers). \"Hyper-\" meaning \"too much\" and \"-plasia\" meaning proliferation of cells. \"Focal\" means clearly present in a specific spot. \"Duct\" is a milk duct in the breast (the most common site for most kinds of breast tumors both benign & malignant). So in your biopsy sample, the pathologist found both some inactive thickening of the connective tissue, and a small spot inside the duct that has too many cells lining the inside. But since those cells look normal and not \"atypical,\" they're benign thus far. \"Columnar cells\" are a type of epithelial cell--surface cells that line parts of the body such as the inside lining of the arteries, mouth, throat, stomach, nasal passages and breast milk ducts & lobules. What makes an epithelial cell \"columnar\" is that it is much taller than it is wide (actually looks like a little column). \"Columnar cell change\" means that those kind of epithelial cells found in your biopsy sample other than the \"focal\" spot mentioned earlier are growing a bit faster than normal inside the duct lining but still in a single layer. This is nothing to worry about. It doesn't even warrant further investigation, much less treatment of any kind. It might raise the risk for cancer, but not by a significant amount and is by no means even a \"pre-cancer.\" It's not ADH (abnormal but not cancerous, and usually removed by an excision procedure that doesn't even count as a lumpectomy). And it certainly isn't DCIS (which is the earliest stage of breast cancer). Your doctor is not going to want to test it further. But (s)he'll probably want to keep an eye on it in a few months (more likely, a year). You won the biopsy lottery. In a good way.",

      "Content": "Dec 4, 2015 06:13AM - edited Dec 4, 2015 06:21AM by ChiSandy I had the 3DCRT--it's a shorter profile of more intense external radiation to only the tumor cavity and a margin around it. Some ROs do it for only a week (2 sessions a day, same sched. as brachytherapy), but mine does the Canadian protocol of 16 treatments (3 workweeks + 1 day). Even though my \u201cradiation buddy\" (another patient who has the same surgical/medical/oncology team and had her lumpectomy a week later than mine--we had appointments back-to-back and got to chatting in the waiting room) is a couple of months older than me, had the same Oncotype score and histology (ER+/PR+/HER2-) and also had grade 2 node-neg. clean-margin IDC, she is getting the full-course meal of 33 whole-breast treatments. The difference is that her tumor was >2cm. and she was therefore stage IIA; her tumor was closer to the center. According to our RO, I was offered the shorter intensive protocol not just because of my age, tumor grade and oncotype score, but also because I was stage IA and the tumor's location (upper outer quadrant, close to the surface) and size relative to my breast size was optimal for partial-breast radiation. Had the tumor been larger, located closer to the center, and my breast small I would probably have not been offered the option of partial-breast radiation. My RO participated in a larger clinical trial of partial vs. full rads for low-Oncotype women 60 and older, and the results (data is being prepared for release) were identical as to recurrence and survival. As to other radiation therapies, I had asked about IORT and brachytherapy at my first surgical consult and pre-op \u201cteaching session\" with my bs' nurse. The Evanston branch of Kellogg doesn't offer either. My bs said that IORT keeps the patient under anesthesia too long, and doesn't appear to have recurrence-prevention stats comparable to external rads; and in her experience, it and brachytherapy carry a higher risk of infection, internal scarring and seroma formation, and brachytherapy is uncomfortable and inconvenient for the patient since sessions are twice daily and must be several hours apart (despite being only one M-F workweek), with the patient in relative isolation because she's radioactive while the seeds are in the catheters and each session is longer than external treatment. She must either hang around the hospital all day or go home or to work and come back--which makes it inadvisable to try to work during that time. They've found that catheter insertion and withdrawal can be somewhat painful and that the catheters must stay in for the entire week--they are rather cumbersome and uncomfortable for the patient during non-treatment hours (including overnight). The shorter treatment period of one week offers no advantage and more side effects than three weeks of external-beam hyperfocused therapy, other than duration--recurrence and survival were also similar, but complications were more common. Because of my large breast size and the fact I get asthma, I had asked about prone rather than supine--Evanston didn't have a table that could do that, but they would have been willing to let me transfer to a different facility were I to be getting whole-breast (especially on the left). With external-beam radiation, you will feel nothing while it's being administered. Each \u201czap\" is 30 seconds or shorter. With partial-breast, if you're going to get skin issues (I didn't--my breast is redder and tanner but the skin wasn't tender, itchy or peeling) and fatigue, they won't usually happen until after treatment ends, and they will be fleeting compared to those of whole-breast. \"DD boobs?\" I wish. I could have bought bras off the rack at any dept. or discount store. How\u2019s 38I sound? DD would be my goal were I to get reductions! Oh, and I too have had scoliosis since childhood (though orthopedists told my folks it was too mild to treat). When they were positioning me on the table to straighten me out, it felt like I was instead being pulled into \u201cElephant Man\u201d mis-alignment. I\u2019d never had much trouble with it, except right before my first knee replacement surgery, when they were giving me the epidural--they missed by a hair and it felt like I had stuck my spine into a light socket. They had to do it under portable fluoroscopy. (When I had my C-section decades earlier, the anesthesiologist hit her mark on the first try--maybe she\u2019d eyeballed my posture and noticed the streak from my bellybutton was not straight).",

Have to take a look at the bottle, but I don't recall lidocaine being among the ingredients--it's basically menthol. Interestingly, I can't take menthol cough drops--I find them extremely drying, causing me to cough and sometimes triggering an asthma attack. Menthol is plant-derived (from mint) and as such is sometimes an allergen--what you experienced, Marijen, was an acute allergic reaction which might have become anaphylaxis had you not caught it in time. Last week at my MO's office, I ran into my ex-office-manager (I retired a few yrs. ago from her husband's law office). A bit of a coincidence, as we also have the same PCP (at a different hospital system, no less). She had her lumpectomy 2 yrs. ago, at age 78. Because of her advanced age, she had no radiation, just letrozole--from which she had no side effects. (My RO said that if I were 70, he\u2019d have recommended against RT for me too). I have my sim session (and perhaps mini-tats) this coming Thurs. and start the first of my 16 APBI treatments on Monday. I have laid in a supply of aloe and calendula creams (no-alcohol), as well as alcohol-free lidocaine gel which I probably won't need and a couple of moist cooling burn pads. (CVS didn't have the blue combo aloe-lidocaine version, just the green alcohol-based one). Also Tom's deodorant (calendula, no aluminum) for the armpit on the treatment side (can still use antiperspirant on the other 'pit), cornstarch and a soft velour powder puff. Wonder if I should go to the garden center and buy an aloe plant--no chance of any irritating additives. RO says that the treated area isn't touched by the underwire from a bra and I should wear whatever I find most comfy. But I do have a few Amoena shelf-bra camis if I don't feel like messing with front or rear hooks. The \u201cgirls\" will probably hang a little low in them, so I will probably throw on some front-close blouses for appearance's sake.

So I expect that at some point during the 16 zaps or soon after treatment ends I might have to put away the underwires again if irritation occurs (which, due to the fewer number of sessions, the therapist says it might not). In that case I would probably switch to spandex seamless shelf-bra camis. I have decided that immediately after each treatment I will aloe up and put on coconut oil at bedtime. I peeked downstairs at the pharmacy in the Kellogg Cancer Center, and noticed that they carry the usual array of Aquaphor and Eucerin, as well as Udderly Smooth, a different brand of aloe cream, and the same brand of no-alcohol lidocaine burn gel I bought at CVS (I also have Alocane, but it has twice the lidocaine).

They occasionally start the session by taking x-rays to make sure I'm positioned exactly as I was during the sim-session CT scan; and they sometimes have to move the table remotely to fine-tune my position.The linear accelerator they're using isn't very loud at all--sort of a cross between a hum and a buzz--and I get three beams of about 10-15 sec. each (with the machine head positioned laterally \u201cbelow the horizon\" aiming up, laterally above aiming down, and finally straight down from above. For a couple of treatments I had a fourth beam with the machine head positioned at the same level as the table and the beam aimed straight at the side of my breast). No irritation at all, but the seroma in my breast is getting larger, turning my right breast (which had been the smaller one) into a sort of Teenage Mutant Ninja Tit-tle. (My cleavage is now skewed to the left, but I can still wear my ordinary bras). The seroma at my SNLB site seems to be shrinking, replaced by scar tissue.",

Makes sense--especially since my dentist even makes me wear a lead apron when x-raying my mouth. Linda, you can\u2019t prevent burning. The tissue gets damaged below the skin, and if you\u2019re lucky the redness and pigmentation change is in the dermis and not the epidermis. If you did anything to prevent that, the radiation would not work as well as it should. The reason most women get irritation & itching and many get flaking, peeling or even blistering is that normally, your epidermal cells are constantly dying and being replaced (imperceptibly) by new ones. Unfortunately, the cells that produce new skin are damaged by the radiation and can\u2019t reproduce fast enough to replace the dying skin. Because not all of those skin-generating skills are destroyed, you start getting better a few days to 3 wks after treatment is over, as new skin once again begins getting produced faster than the old skin dies. The best you can do prevention-wise is to keep your skin moisturized between sessions so that it feels less sensitive during the period when you can\u2019t make new skin cells fast enough. But you can make your damaged-from-the-inside-out skin feel less itchy and irritated by using creams, gels, prescription topical steroids, etc. between treatments. In other words, you can treat the symptoms.",

      "Content": "Feb 21, 2017 03:04PM - edited Feb 21, 2017 03:13PM by ChiSandy I live in the north lakefront Chicago neighborhood of Edgewater Glen, a good 40 mi. s. of Zion (the location of CTCA). But if you find yourself with time on your hands and thumbs to twiddle <g>, shoot me a private message and maybe I can head up there. If you're up to it, perhaps a little \u201cretail therapy\" at Gurnee Mills Outlet Mall? As far as \u201cnuclear\" pre-op, there are two different procedures. One, the radioactive seed locator implantation, takes the place of the \u201cwire localization\" that until recently was standard\u2014with the latter, you sometimes even had to go home with a wire sticking out of your breast pointing out the tumor location. I had a titanium clip implanted after the core needle biopsy. The seed locator implantation was a piece of cake for me\u2014just a repeat ultrasound to find the tumor and the clip, a tiny hair-thin needle shot of lidocaine, the seed injected, and the Nuc. Med. team running a Geiger counter over it and declaring, \u201cshe's hot.\" (Should've replied \u201cthat's what he said\"). The needle for the lidocaine was so thin I barely felt it, without the need for a topical. The other \u201cnuclear\" procedure was the injection of a radioactive tracer to locate the sentinel node(s). For that one, I wish I'd have had some EMLA cream applied half an hour in advance (worked like a charm for my friend)\u2014instead, just a little ethylene chloride as a topical, followed by the tracer injection\u2026into the nipple & areola. That location is necessary because the ducts converge at the nipple (that's how the milk gets out), and the tracer travels to and is taken up by the first node(s) upstream of the tumor (and reacts to a Geiger counter in the OR). Then they made me massage my armpit for 15 min. to see if anything lit up on a nuclear camera photo. (They gave me a nice Americana alt-folk playlist and good headphones to pass the time). It didn't, so they sent me back to my roomette for half an hour and then took me back to the camera, where the nodes lit up. I didn\u2019t go to CTCA because I live quite close to NorthShore Evanston Hospital, with its Center for Breast Health and adjacent Kellogg Cancer Center (all part of the Univ. of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine). I was also 64, and knew I\u2019d still need at least adjuvant treatment after turning 65, when I went on Medicare. I was told CTCA requires either good conventional (i.e., private, employer-provided, or a high-end ACA plan) health insurance or a massive cash deposit\u2014not Medicare. We had enough of the latter, but with such good care a <20-min. drive away (and which also accepts Medicare), I didn\u2019t see a need to drive so far north. Ironic that you traveled all the way from NJ\u2014but people do come to regional CTCAs from all over. Any reason you chose the one in Zion, IL rather than Philly? (Was it the oncology team led by Dr. Citrin)?",

Many of the included excursions are labeled \u201cModerate\u201d and one is \u201cDemanding.\u201d We did some research on this particular cruise, and found that most shore excursions are drive-past-the-attractions rather than get-out-and-explore, so I should be fine. No mandatory shipboard activities. The ship has a great spa, but I\u2019m going to have to forego it since saunas, schvitzes and hot tubs are all no-nos during any kind of adjuvant treatment. (I will, however, ask about what kinds of massages & facials are safe; there\u2019s also a \u201csnow cave,\u201d but it\u2019s kind of slippery and one of the reasons we\u2019re hitting the southern Med in winter is to get away from snow). We took a Viking River Cruise three years ago, Budapest to Amsterdam, and the only reasons I had any problem with the walking tours were pace (I was only 12 wks post-knee-replacement surgery and 30 lbs. heavier); and angular cobblestones in those little German towns. I didn\u2019t want to look like an \u201cugly American\u201d tourist in gym shoes and fanny pack, so instead of comfy sneakers I wore my Finn Comfort orthopedic walking shoes--and the soles were not thick enough to prevent severe metatarsal bruising that lasted several months. I\u2019ve since learned my lesson--I bought Finn Comforts with thick rocker-profile soles as well as Hoka One One running shoes that feel like I\u2019m walking on pillows. Not at all fashionable, but I\u2019ll save fashion for onboard. I may also play the cancer card and request a wheelchair in airports (and try to see if I can convert my ticket to either Economy Comfort or even Business class at the gate--hubby says he\u2019s fine in Coach). The one bummer is that in order to get better wines than the included plonk, we have to buy the Silver Spirits package, and it has to be for the entire cabin and not just my husband. The only extras I might get with that are creative \u201cmocktails\" and actual espresso from the bar instead of ersatz cappuccino from the self-serve machine. The better wines will be lost on me, since I can have only three glasses\u2019 worth over the entire cruise due to having an ER+ tumor. (A small price to pay, even though I was up till now an oenophile, for a less aggressive cancer).",

      "Content": "Oct 19, 2015 03:59PM - edited Oct 19, 2015 04:05PM by ChiSandy I got my shingles vax 3 yrs ago, and Prevnar 13 and Fluzone Hi-Dose the week before surgery. Keeping fingers crossed. As to how we women with non-functioning ovaries (or no ovaries) still make estrogen, it's not true that the adrenal glands convert fat to estrogen--it's a bit more complex, and there are actually two different mechanisms for estrogen synthesis. The adrenals make a hormone called androstenedione, which is then converted to estrogen by the enzyme aromatase. And fat cells (NOT dietary fat!) also make androstenedione (and sometimes, estrogen directly w/o being converted from androstenedione). Again aromatase is the culprit. Dietary sugar's role in this (as well as starch converted to sugar) is mediated by both the pancreas and liver. The pancreas secretes insulin, which in normal levels in people w/o metabolic syndrome mops up excess glucose in the blood and sends it to the liver to be turned into glycogen for muscles to burn. But as we age, especially if we have the other two components of metabolic syndrome (hypertension and high LDL/triglycerides), we become more resistant to the beneficial effects of insulin (developing prediabetes and eventually Type 2--the third member of the metabolic-syndrome triad)--and instead of mopping up the blood glucose, insulin is secreted in ever-larger amounts and sends glucose to the liver where it is converted to fat for storage rather than glycogen for ready energy. The fat thus produced is stored in our fat cells (which one never loses unless surgically removed!), which are little hormone factories as mentioned earlier. Dietary fat, in the absence of dietary sugars & starches and if excess calories aren't consumed, gets burned rather than stored. (In full-blown Type 2, the pancreas can eventually give up and stop secreting insulin altogether--which is why so many Type 2 diabetics must supplement meds with insulin shots. At that point, elevated body fat from insulin--while still unhealthy--is less dangerous than the effects of excess blood sugar). If \u201candrostenedione\" sounds familiar, it's the same substance---a steroid analogue--that can be purchased OTC and which Mark McGwyre and Sammy Sosa admitted to having used during their home-run-king years in MLB. In young, lean & healthy men, it gets converted to testosterone. In older & obese men, it gets converted to estrogen--hence gynecomastia as a side effect. Alcohol's role in this is that it makes the liver less able to clear estrogen from the bloodstream and then help us excrete it harmlessly. There's some evidence that after being on AIs for awhile, because there's less estrogen to clear. alcohol consumption can gradually be increased to a near-heart-healthy level (5 5-oz. glasses of wine/wk, certainly no more than 1/day). A friend of mine in her late 60s who manages a wine-centric restaurant was told that by her MO--she's been on Arimidex for 5 yrs and he wants her on it for a 6th. But for those of us just starting AIs (or who haven't yet), 2-3 glasses should be the weekly limit. And those who've never drunk alcohol shouldn't use heart health as a reason to start. There are other ways to stay heart-healthy.",

It was a twisted two-tone chain-link with lobster claw clasp--a real bear to fasten, and too small unless I added extenders--which made it too big. Then the clasps broke . So I went back to Amazon. Noticed a lot that said \u201cItalian charm bracelet,\u201d but they were all those that looked like skinny watchbands, with tiny emblems and are too difficult to change the beads. Then I saw one with dual lobster clasps....and it was a Pandora-style stainless steel cable with one plain lobster claw and one with a cap that unscrews so you can put charms on it. First time I showed it to the LE doc, who diagnosed me at Stage 0 (where he says I still am), he advised me to get one with a pink emblem, as EMTs and nurses don\u2019t even think \u201clymphedema\u201d or \u201cbreast cancer\u201d unless they see pink. (He gave me an ugly pink hospital-ID plastic wristband). So I went back to Amazon and clicked on a link for www. LaurensHope.com. All they do is medical alert jewelry. They sell bracelets with and without plates and plates with and without bracelets, in a variety of materials. They made me an ID plate with a big pink caduceus MedicAlert symbol--and on the back, my name, \u201cLymphedema R Arm No Ndl/BP,\u201d \u201cAlgy PCN, Sulfa, Cipro,\u201d and two ICE phone numbers. I put a bunch of charms on it (Imitation Pandora--the real ones go on my real Pandora bracelet) that are personal to me: pink bc ribbon dangle, garnet birthstone bead, gold-plated cat bead, treble-clef bead, wine-barrel bead, little cappuccino cup (complete with latte art) bead, and scales-of-justice dangle. But the first thing you see is the ID plate with that big honkin\u2019 hot pink MedicAlert symbol. (My real Pandoras also include dangles for places I love to travel--Eiffel Tower, Big Ben, Spain & Italy hearts; have lived--Empire State Bldg. with red apple dangle, Space Needle, Water Tower; globe, guitar dangle, passport dangle, black Murano cat, baby shoe with blue CZ, even a little moka pot dangle (complete with the little vent valve on the side). I got some forearm cording shortly after finishing rads and thought I felt some upper arm tightness while up in the foothills near Mt. Etna in Taormina, Sicily (which resolved when we descended to the port where our cruise ship was docked). I got a sleeve & gauntlet per my BS\u2019 NP\u2019s instructions--to wear it for flights>4 hrs. (donning it an hour before takeoff and removing it an hour after landing, but not realizing how long a layover I had in Amsterdam, so I just kept the stuff on till we got to our hotel in Rome). I hadn\u2019t planned to wear it for short and domestic flights, but I noticed some finger swelling on a 2-1/2 hr. flight from London-Geneva. So I wear compression for every flight. And because I got arm tightness when we had brunch on the 95th fl. of the John Hancock (the elevator ascended very quickly), I keep a set in my purse just in case. Because of that, and the Taormina episode, I played it safe and wore it while I stayed up in the Blue Ridge Mts. for a music conference. (I have patterned sets for various outfits). I was advised by my PT to wear compression for all upper body (and strenuous cardio) exercise--anything that sends blood to the affected arm. Also for playing guitar--just draping my R arm over the guitar body can put pressure on it--and repetitive arm work (whisking, lots of chopping, pot scrubbing, etc.). I also expect to wear it if it gets very hot outside; and I try not to get a window seat on planes in daytime. I found that once my swelling and radiation fibrosis at the lx site began to subside I could sleep on my R side (I need to roll over every so often to clear my sinuses, and I snore on my back), and it has no effect. And I do MLD every couple of days, and oftener when I feel my arm tightening because a storm front is coming through. I also am trying to lose weight, to get down to my pre-letrozole weight and possibly my pre-dx weight. I have also increased my water intake, limited sodium, and have about 3-5 oz glasses of wine a week when I do drink. I don\u2019t limit caffeine. It sounds like a lot of fuss & bother, but it really isn\u2019t a big deal. BTW, my friend who had a bmx and is 50 lbs. heavier than me had 3 nodes out on ea. side, and her surgeon and nurse-navigator said not to do anything. The surgeon said \u201cWe treat LE with compression, so what\u2019s the harm with doing BP briefly?\u201d My LE doc (the top guy in the nation, founder of LANA, advised the drafters of the Lymphedema Treatment Act) says he normally never prescribes compression to someone with only 4 nodes out, but I should believe my body and trust what I feel. He also says it\u2019s fine to get a cortisone shot for trigger thumb in my R hand, and eventually tendon release surgery (no need to be wrapped if tourniquet time is at a minimum and infection precautions--including pre-medicating--are taken).",

As for compression, he says basically to take reasonable precautions: if I expect to go out in very hot weather, experience rapid or prolonged air pressure changes or engage in repetitive arm-movement exercise, heavy lifting or have to drape my arm over something (like a guitar body) that can constrict it. Normally, the rule of thumb is that compression is unnecessary on flights shorter than 4 hrs., but I noticed a bit of finger tightness on a 2-hr. flight w/in Europe, so I wear compression for flights of any length now, skyscraper elevator rides, or high altitude.",

I had only 16 treatments, so I was never too tired to drive; since it snowed only on the weekend, I didn't have to call an Uber or use the CTA train (3 bl. between both the hospital and home and stations--would have required a change of train at the city line). There is a much closer hospital, with free parking, in Evanston only 10-15 min. away (along the same street), but I preferred the integrative approach of having my entire cancer care team at one hospital (despite having had to pay for parking).

Diagnosis, via a phone call from my gyne's office the day after biopsy, hit me like a ton of bricks; so I immediately hung up, downloaded Elisa Port's & Susan Love's bc \u201cBibles\" and started investigating reputable sites (here, Komen, ACS) and staying off the rest of Google.

I used to have a glass or two of good wine with dinner and enjoy fine dining several times a week--and my low-carb diet was heavy on the beef, cheese & charcuterie. No more--gotta be more careful, eat leaner \"dead animals\" and more \u201cleaves.\" And my wine is limited to a pint or less per week. I had to drop out of the Bar Assn. show last fall because I expected to be too fatigued (turns out I wasn't but I didn't want to take the chance of hurting the production). I used to gig every weekend, criss-crossing the Midwest or even venturing into other regions to record, perform and attend music conferences. I now appreciate things closer to home--and my family. I perform now only when the joy of performing outweighs sweating the logistics (parking, schlepping equipment, fretting over adequate draw or merch sales). I get much more sleep--my 8 hrs/night are a priority. BUT I didn't give up going to concerts. I still perform closer to home--and I make others load, unload & schlep. Still take my weekly voice lessons. Rejoined the Bar Show cast. I didn't give up restaurants--I am just pickier about the menu and unafraid to make my needs known to the staff; and I still cook adventurously, just without the sugar & starch whenever possible. And I cook from scratch most nights too. More fish & poultry now than mammal meat. Wine? Instead of 5 or 6 oz 3x/week, 2 or 3 oz. every other day, sometimes oftener (and if it isn't a wine I love, I'm sticking to seltzer). I'm walking a lot more than before (though still not enough). And I still travel--but with my husband. And much further afield, and for fun, not career. Since my diagnosis a year ago: we took a Mediterranean cruise; I traveled to London, Lausanne & Paris for an educational trip (nominally educational but personally fulfilling); we went to San Antonio for an extended weekend; and we just got back from 10 days in Italy (Rome & Tuscany). Vegas this Dec. too. So are there things you will have to give up? Yes. Things you will have to modify? Yes. Things you can do as well as or better than before? Yes. But don't get ahead of yourself. Time to put one foot ahead of the other at a time and take the days as they come. Most importantly, not only shouldn't you panic about the future, but you shouldn't second-guess the past either.",

      "Content": "Oct 17, 2015 01:42AM - edited Oct 18, 2015 03:26PM by ChiSandy Hi, queenmomcat. I have no idea how long my RT will be delayed, as I just had my ruptured seroma sutured today and am not optimistic as to its healing. (Everything I've read on these and other boards indicates repeated seromas &/or infections are the norm for those seromas that ruptured instead of being resorbed. My husband, OTOH, had a huge seroma after hernia surgery and it resorbed after a month). I'm especially pessimistic because I even developed a small seroma after my core-needle biopsy (!); and I am allergic to penicillin, sulfa and the quinolones (e.g., Cipro)--I hope I don't see a PICC line in my future. Here I was riding high because I could skip chemo, conserve my breast, and get accelerated partial RT for half the length of time...and now this. The sutures must remain in for a week, maybe two--assuming the incision closes. The type of RT I'm getting will be aimed only at the tumor cavity, which doesn't seem affected--but I notice that the whole breast, even the nipple, feels sensitive again (even though the tumor was in the \u201c10:00\" position on the outside toward the rear). So I'm hoping the markings will be precise and they can avoid the seroma area. I'll find out more at my sim session next week and my surgical followup the day after. I hope I can be done in time to go on the Mediterranean cruise (Rome to Barcelona) we booked for the week before Christmas (fly to Rome 12/12, sail 12/15-22). Naturally, this seroma exploded after we booked our shore excursions and shipboard dining reservations. Wanna make G-d laugh? Tell Him your plans. I'm prepared with aloe cream (not gel) for the irradiated area and cornstarch to dust on from a filled clean soft white sock. Also looking for nonmetallic deodorant (e.g., Tom's) and some Pears or Neutrogena unscented clear soap. And it looks like I'll be back in my saggy, jiggly cotton-knit stretch leisure bras for awhile. (Marijen, they don't make the Fruit of the Loom ones for my size 38I--the only ones that fit are Leading Lady (40F/G/H was the closest), and they have a vertical dart right next to the nipple). I'm concerned that the inadequate support that non-wired bras (especially these) provide may have helped cause the seroma to burst--the surgeon who saw me today says that the weight of my very large breast (I cup US/G cup UK) may have been partly or mostly to blame--even though the rupture occurred when I was wearing a supportive and comfy underwire bra. (The wire doesn't touch either the lumpectomy or sentinel node incision site). Meanwhile, the surgical nurse sent me home with a raft of gauze pads and paper tape for dressing changes. I might try to use an Ace wrap as a binder over my bra. I might try wearing the shelf-bra camis I bought in anticipation of needing full-breast radiation. Toughest thing, though, will be to keep my cats from walking on my chest (\u201cno, kitty, stay off Mommy's boobie with the boo-boo\"). ",

I also wore a bra or shelf-cami (still do) 24/7 except in the shower. Those who did have radiation in that area reported that tucking a soft cloth under the breast did the trick; some wore a bra over the cloth, some wore a soft cotton tank or tee beneath the bra. The soft stretch knit front-close leisure bras I wear to sleep are by Leading Lady, available on HerRoom.com, FullBeauty.com (formerly Roamans), and BareNecessities.com. They're pretty cheap, in the $20 range, and come as large as 44F/G/H. The camis I bought at a breast cancer boutique (Second Act) in Chicago are by Amoena--they're pretty pricey and run a couple of sizes smaller than your normal blouse or shirt size (I'm a 14/16, but I bought 20s and they're snug), so it's best to buy those in person. --->EDITED to change \u201cwas irradiated\u201d to \u201cwasn\u2019t\"",

I routinely carry 10 lbs or more of groceries and guitar cases with my other arm, without donning compression. As a Cross-Fit devotee, you probably have an optimal BMI and aerobic capacity--both of these lower your risk. But start slowly again and work up",

My car is now on autopilot up Ridge Ave. to Evanston Hosp. But it is frustrating that it rules all my weekdays--one of my best friends (who is a brittle diabetic with COPD) suddenly went into fluid overload and is in the ICU at Northwestern Hosp. downtown (closest to her home in Lincoln Park) for respiratory distress. Can't see her at all tomorrow, since I have to hang around the house in the a.m. for a bunch of deliveries and make sure the landscapers don't rip out and discard the rest of my annual herbs before I can dig them up; in the afternoon is my rads and then I committed to picking up a friend to go to a concert at City Winery in early evening. (Tom Paxton's farewell tour, for you folkies; Michael Miles, who played on my first CD, is opening). Earliest I can see my friend is Friday, and I'm stuck in the western 'burbs all day Sat. hosting a songwriters' event. At least DH (who is her internist at a different hospital--her husband is a retinologist at DH's hospitals and is both DH's colleaugue and eye doc as well as friend) can come with me Sunday to visit--it's a rare weekend off for him. Anyway, yesterday and today they took X-rays beforehand. Met with my RO yesterday (will be doing that weekly). He says that there's a huge seroma in my tumor cavity, which is what's probably accounting for the lion's share of breast sensitivity and why \u201cLouise\" is no smaller than \u201cThelma\" despite having a chunk carved out. He's not worried--says that's common in lumpectomies and it should resorb, whether or not it's replaced by scar tissue. Meanwhile, the lumpectomy scar and immediately surrounding area don't seem to be irritated yet, but I'm still using Aquaphor in the changing room right after each session. At night I was using Jason's 84% Aloe cream, but I have decided I can't stand the smell (like stale cheap perfume), so I'll mix some CVS aloe gel with coconut oil and use that instead. No way I can sleep braless--it hurts to have Louise jiggling and I need to sleep on my sides as well as my back. In my 64 years, never did get the hang of sleeping nude, though DH never did get the hang of sleeping in PJs (when we go to hotels he reluctantly wears scrub pants in case he gets up first when room service arrives). And then there's the little matter of \u201cships passing in the night,\" i.e., when I leave the loo and DS is waiting in the hall outside. Yeah, he's 31 and used to rely on \u201cthe girls\" for sustenance (at least for a short while), but it still creeps kids out to see their folks naked! (And it doesn't do my sense of propriety any favors). Haven't had any Aquaphor stains, but I did sweat that brown washable marker on to the lining of my favorite bra. Dang. (Baby shampoo to the rescue). I do have a question--what the radiation therapist gave me were a few tubes of Aquaphor \u201cHealing Ointment.\" I already have a large jar of Aquaphor \u201cOriginal Formula\" labeled for \u201cextremely dry skin.\" Is it the same thing with just a name change? If so, I needn't replace the tubes when they run out, just scoop some out of the big jar into a little purse-size one for immediately after treatments.",

Perhaps it\u2019s a function of them irradiating the front of my breast for the first time yesterday--the first two treatments were aimed only at my lumpectomy scar, halfway down on the outside of my breast (as was the first half of treatment #3). Probably also because I\u2019m getting stronger doses due to the shorter course of treatment. The skin itself isn\u2019t sore, but rather the tissue beneath. I wonder if it\u2019s caused by my breast being largely a seroma at this point? At any rate, I may have to get some bras in a J cup and pad the left breast!

They're doing it as 3 daily beams aimed at the tumor cavity from different angles, and because it is a shorter protocol, each zap is more powerful than what's administered for whole-breast rads. (Counting my blessings that I'm not getting the true APBI of 2 zap sessions a day for 5 days--I hear that can be pretty rough skin-wise). That's probably why the swelling set in so soon--but my RO says the positioning X-rays show a very large seroma in that breast anyway, which was likely \u201cpercolating\" for quite a while. There's no swelling in the arm or axilla--just scarring beneath the SNB incision and a bit of a seroma behind that. So I doubt it's lymphedema. (However, I did buy the sleeve & gauntlet, as I will be flying transatlantically in Dec.). From what I've read, seromas can resorb as quickly as one month (as did my husband's from his hernia surgery) or last as long as a year. I wouldn't worry unless you notice signs of infection (such as redness and heat) and/or swelling around your trunk. Everything I read says to \u201cavoid tight clothing, especially tight bras.\" Well, \u201cThelma & Louise\" (especially now \u201cLouise\") are big enough that any bra I wear, even the few stretchy cotton ones that just about fit, will leave indentations. I will ask my RO when I see him sometime this week what if anything I can do. No way can I go braless, not even for sleep--the jiggling hurts more than when I'm wearing a bra. And the built-in-\u201cshelf\" camis I bought after surgery are now small enough to fit like binders--perhaps they'll leave no marks on the breast itself but the elastic certainly will bind in the crease beneath. But as long as this seroma isn't going to burst, I can live with it. I suspect that once it resorbs and is possibly replaced with scar tissue, \u201cLouise\" will be smaller than she was pre-surgery.",

The ones I bought to sleep in are 40F/G/H--the largest made, and just about fit. I think I might start sleeping in one of the size 20 (I'm a 14/16, or in Chico\u2019s-speak 2 or 3) shelf-bra camis I bought at the breast-cancer specialty boutique before I found out I'd only be getting the partial-breast 16-zapper. In retrospect, with this dang breast seroma (or at this point, a breast surrounding a seroma) I wish I'd thrown vanity to the winds and bought size 22 or even 24 instead. Today was session 14 of 16. Funny, I never thought to bring any music to listen to--maybe it's my chronic tinnitus, but the machine is much less loud than the CT was (and exponential orders of magnitude softer than an MRI). The treatments are very short--from getting on the table to walking out the door it's only 10-15 min. or so. There's an adult-rock satellite station piped in anyway. Ironic that today's songs were John Mayer's \u201cWaitin' on the World to Change\" and especially--in light of ISIS' twisted wish for a global caliphate--Tears for Fears' \u201cEverybody Wants to Rule the World.\" On the ceiling for me to stare at is a backlit panel of a photo of autumn leaves and bare branches against a blue sky. A few of the branches seem to form a crude sketch of a Modigliani-long-necked woman (with a leaf for a mouth) with broad symmetrical shoulders. I've been focusing on that--as well as being fascinated by the green lasers and the movement of the linear accelerator head. There seems to be something vaguely hilarious about it rising from below back up over the \u201chorizon\" to do its second zap--sort of like Kilroy slowly peeking up over the fence. So I don't have any unpleasant associations yet. However, if I never see another tube of Aquaphor again........",

      "Content": "Nov 25, 2015 11:09PM - edited Nov 26, 2015 03:23PM by ChiSandy Another fall-rads sister checking in here--I finished two days ago. (felt really weird to be able to shower and \u201clube\" my breast any time I wanted and not have to make the daily drive up to north Evanston). Here are my observations\" 1. Don't expect you will get all the side effects, nor that you will get any of them intensely. I am very fair-skinned and turned barely pink-tan. No actual irritation either. Got nausea only once--the day after--and only because I was busy and I'd forgotten to eat! And though I don't feel like walking a mile or two, I didn't get the dreaded fatigue either. (I had only 16 partial-breast treatments, but they were twice as strong). But I did make sure to get 8 hrs. of sleep a night, and to power-nap on those few days I couldn't. 2. Per queenmomcat, don't stock up on all the things people have mentioned helped them. I spent an arm & a leg on support camisoles, button-front shirts & PJs, various creams, cooling towel, non-metallic deodorant, lidocaine gel and cornstarch--which I didn't use. In fact, half the non-wired bras I bought went back into storage, either because they were scratchy or gave no support. And ask whether your armpit will be within the radiation field--turns out mine wasn't, so I used my regular antiperspirant throughout. I was able to wear my regular underwire bras throughout--but the wires didn't touch either incision. I was prepared to give them up at the first sign of irritation. And if you do get irritation, watch out for stitching, lace, and stiff coarse fabrics lining the inside of your bra cups if you need to wear a bra. I didn't have to worry about skin-on-skin contact, as my underbust was not irradiated. Unless you live in the middle of nowhere without even a Walmart or Target, you will have plenty of chances to buy stuff you need when and as you'll need it. Save money and storage space! 3. Pick a time (if you can) that best fits how you normally structure your day. I'm retired from the 9-5 grind and am an unabashed night owl. So I picked 3:15 pm--not so late I'd get stuck in rush hour, but late enough that I could get up when I wanted, shower and dress with time to kick back and have coffee & a snack first. 4. You might not have to get tattooed: I got Sharpie marks covered with long-lasting clear tape, that stayed on for three weeks of daily showers and came off painlessly & completely once I was done. 5. Don't assume your radiated breast will shrivel up. Mine swelled because of the tumor-cavity seroma. But if you have a SNB seroma, be prepared for it, too, to swell. Mine did at first but began shrinking again the last few days of treatment. If you feel like you're wearing a shoulder holster, a small pillow between arm & breast can help. And because your breast (and perhaps nipple) will feel somewhat sensitive, place a cushion or pad between you and your car's shoulder belt....and redirect your pets away from that breast. 6. Nonetheless, it's a good idea to prophylactically moisturize & lube your breast starting right after your first session. (I used Aquaphor after each session because they gave me a few tubes that fit in my purse, and at night and on weekends I found that pure aloe gel or calendula cream--I alternated--worked well. An aloe cream I had bought turned out to have a fragrance that was too perfumey and I stopped using it after the first day). Also, no matter what you shower with on the rest of your body (e.g., I use L'Occitaine citrus verbena shower gel on a nylon scrubby puff), use only a mild soap without fragrance or deodorants. I used Basis white unscented bar soap and a soft micro-velour wash mitt on my irradiated breast. I patted dry with one of those soft microfiber hair towels that houseware & linens stores sell, rather than the regular coarser terry towel I used on the rest of my body. 7. When in doubt, ask your RO, nurses and therapists what they prefer you do and do not do--even if you get printed handouts as I did. Not everything in there may apply to you. Be especially clear about whether your breast must be completely clean and free of any creams, ointments or gels when you walk into the treatment room. Despite others here saying they applied \u201cprotection\" before each treatment, I was told to leave at least 4 hours between such application and treatment--and it was suggested I shower before each treatment. So I did. 8. If you haven't already started a notebook documenting your journey (with sections for each aspect of diagnosis and treatment), start a radiation diary--list each treatment, any symptoms, and what you did about it.",

It\u2019s natural to feel angry and scared, even if our diagnoses are less dire and planned treatment easier than others\u2019. My radiation dept. gave me a handful of tubes of Aquaphor--handy, because they fit in my purse so I could lube-up immediately after each treatment before getting dressed again. At night, I found that both Boiron brand calendula cream and the clear (no dye, alcohol, or fragrance) 100% aloe gel that the cancer center\u2019s pharmacy sells worked equally well. Didn\u2019t even need the lidocaine burn gel or moist burn pads. Now that I am 5 days post-treatment, I\u2019m just using the aloe and it\u2019s fine. I\u2019d advise avoiding Jason\u2019s 84% aloe cream because it smells too perfume-y. If you do buy Aquaphor, make sure that it\u2019s the \u201cadvanced healing\u201d rather than the \u201coriginal\u201d formula. It has more lanolin and you can get it in a tube with its own applicator. It\u2019s not worth buying the large economy size because you won\u2019t use it up.

Radiation burns are different from sun or thermal burns--they manifest from the inside toward the skin, instead of on the skin and then reaching down through the dermal layers. This is why my center insisted that if I use creams or lotions on the day of treatment, I leave at least 4 hrs. between applying them and the session. The reason for using skin-conditioners immediately after each treatment and again later in the day (and several times on off-days) is to make the outer layers of skin more resistant to damage manifesting below the surface, as well as to soothe any surface damage that may occur. That\u2019s why during treatment, on the weekdays I applied aloe at night and showered it off in the morning so there\u2019d be no residue on my skin while being irradiated. On weekends, I showered when it was most convenient (sometimes at bedtime). On that breast & armpit I used only Basis Unscented soap (Dove Unscented for Sensitive Skin is also good, as is Simple, Pears unscented glycerine, and plain unmedicated Neutrogena). I was out of the Dove Unscented I used to carry with me when traveling to large conferences where I\u2019d be in close proximity (elevators, crowded corridors) to attendees with multiple chemical sensitivities (one poor soul walks around in a gas-mask-style respirator). On my breast, I used only my hands to lather & apply the soap.

Cruise itself is Dec. 15, leaving from the Rome-area port of Civitavecchia. Viking's pre-sail Rome extension was sold out, so we're doing it on our own, staying at the airport Hilton & taking the train into the city. Viking will pick us up at the airport. First port of call is Naples on the 16th, then Taormina, Sicily the 17th, Cagliari, Sardinia the 18th, Messina, Sicily (side trip to Palermo) the 19th (was originally Tunis, but terrorist attacks took that off the table), Palma in the Balearic Islands the 20th, Valencia the 21st, disembark in Barcelona the morning of the 22. Given my druthers, I'd have been up for spending extra time in Barcelona (three days there last spring were not enough, especially since much of the daytime was taken up with continuing legal ed. seminars), but DH had some surgical adventures May through July (first from a botched colonoscopy that perfed his bowel, then an incarcerated hernia); so many of his colleagues covered for him while he was hospitalized that he doesn't want to make them miss pre-Christmas days with their families. So we'll ask the cab driver to take the long way to the airport and give us sort of a nickel tour of the city, as we dock at 7 am but don't fly till 1:30. I normally travel a lot throughout the Midwest & Mid-South for my music (I'm a folksinger/songwriter who plays guitar & dulcimer), but DH's and now my health issues put the kibosh on that for awhile. Did get to gig in Rockford, IL 2 wks after my surgery and drive to a music conference and gig in IA City a month post-op. Usually perform in the Chi. Bar Assn's annual satirical musical revue (the only reason I keep my law license current!), but dropped out this year because I thought radiation would have wiped me out and it wouldn't have been fair to the show if I gave a half-assed performance. So I did a little writing, and maybe next week help with props, costumes & makeup (and play guitar in the \u201cSanta Claus\" finale). Will be back in the cast next year. And this spring's continuing legal ed. trip will be London, Lausanne & Paris.",

You might find nice ones at discount at the outlet malls near O\u2019Hare or in Huntley (especially the Lane Bryant store at the latter). For shelf-bra camis, I went to Second Act Boutique in Lakeview (Lincoln/Ashland/Belmont area--caveat that there are some insurance plans they don\u2019t accept) and bought Amoena in asst. colors. For me (my normal blouse size is 16, XXL or 1X), size 20 (they go up to 24) works.

Closer to you, Bettty Schwartz\u2019 in Buffalo Grove (847) 459-5846, Intimate Healthcare in McHenry (815) 578-0304, and Sheshe in Geneva (630) 232-0933 probably has them too (and can probably also fit you for a lymphedema sleeve & gauntlet).",

One nasty little secret I didn't know till I read the LR Research & Education site: though the LE risk for SNLB of 4 or fewer nodes is only 2-6%, rads raises it to 15-25%, same as for full axillary dissection! So that explains the forearm tightness & soreness when I stretch & torque my right arm. Though my SNLB site was outside the radiation field, there was likely some scatter; and my radiated mammary seroma may have tried to send lymph past my four missing nodes😒 Sitting in Air France lounge, kicking back and my enjoying a cappuccino and Mumm's Cordon Rouge (free!). In a bit less than an hour, will don the sleeve & gauntlet. Had to take off the Medic-Alert bracelet, but all the gory details are in my wallet card ( one in regular wallet, one in neck pouch).

I've been slowly posting pix over in Crazy Town--gotta upload some from my other phone as well as DH's. For now, I've posted mostly Rome & Naples. We had an indoor pool and spa, but I never had the time nor the inclination to use them--not even the gym, since we walked well over a mile each day, much of it on undulating terrain with stairs (and the ship was large enough that we got lots of exercise just going from facility to facility). Because of lymphedema precautions, everything at the spa except the snow-cave was off the table for me, and one does not escape Chiberia for the Mediterranean just to experience artificially-induced snowfall (the snow-cave was mostly for in between sauna sessions, in which I couldn't partake). All spa services (except hair appointments) had long before been booked by those in the upper-deck pricier suite staterooms, who had priority over us peons. As for SPF, a few years ago my derm told me that anything over SPF 45-50 is overkill and doesn't protect any better. Far wiser to apply thickly & often, and after a couple of hrs. either cover up or go indoors. Hats are a must. I have been using facial sunscreen for years--prefer Aveeno moisturizer (50), LaRoche-Posay \u201cRosaliac\" (for rosacea-prone skin) CC cream (50) or Aveeno CC cream (30). Had been using Olay Total Effects CC, but it's only SPF 15. When wearing short sleeves or shorts (and sandals), I put Water Babies 50 on my arms, legs, and feet. Despite that, circumstances can throw a monkey wrench into the works. In 2005, we went to Puerto Vallarta for my voice teacher's wedding, and took a deep-sea fishing trip the day before. I slathered all exposed parts of me with SPF 45--but when the boat hit full speed, salt spray washed it ALL off and I looked like a lobster. First sunburn since 1982 in Ft. Lauderdale; and before that, not since my college days back in the late '60s when we all went out on the quad with sun reflectors and bottles of baby oil mixed with iodine (if we only knew!). Had several peeling burns as a kid, so I am paranoid about melanoma. My best buddy from law school (nearly albino) has had two melanomas and a squamous-cell removed--whenever I'm in SoCal visiting him, the first thing he does is proffer a tube of sunscreen and then ask me where's my hat!",

Nonetheless, even though he didn\u2019t think I had LE his diagnosis was Stage 0 (subclinical) because I\u2019d reported symptoms and so Medicare would pay for physical therapy. He also prescribed a glove rather than a gauntlet for flight or traveling to high altitudes on land (I can still wear a gauntlet for practicing guitar and light exercise).

So I\u2019ve been getting MLD each session and have been doing stretches and (with compression garments) a couple of resistance-band exercises, I also have been given the go-ahead to start using hand weights, starting with one-pounders and not increasing each for a week, a lb. at a time--flys, lats and biceps & triceps curls.",

I was diagnosed after I reviewed my calendar and discovered, \u201coops, my last annual mammogram was 16 months ago.\" 12 hours after the mammo I got the report in my patient portal that my right breast had a \u201cfocal asymmetry not present on 2014 & 2013 mammograms.\" A week later I had the spot compression diagnostic mammo--the tech came in after and told me not to get dressed yet, that the radiologist wanted to do an ultrasound. While I was lying on the table, she directed my attention to the computer screen while she probed, and pointed out a little black jelly-bean shaped blob, which she guesstimated at 7mm. She demonstrated how it didn't compress when she pressed on it with the probe--so that's how I knew it wasn't a cyst. \u201cShit,\" I muttered. Ominously, she didn't disagree--and confirmed I needed to have it biopsied. I could have done so the next day, but I was scheduled to leave for New Orleans (a legal ed. conference and coffeehouse gig, followed by a senior center show in Scranton and folk festival in a Chicago suburb) the next day, and wouldn't be able to have the biopsy till two weeks later. The radiologist replied that I could wait that long, as it was probably growing for years before it was finally discoverable. (I never had any lumps, dimpling, or other breast changes I could see or feel). All during that trip, every moment of work and pleasure kept getting interrupted by the mantra \u201cwhat if, what if, what if....\" I got the initial path report the evening of the day after the biopsy--IDC, grade 2, approx. 7mm. I was shocked, as I'd been expecting DCIS, or grade 1 IDC, at the worst. The morning after that came the better news: ER+, PR+. HER2-.I immediately made an appointment with the surgeon I wanted at the breast center where I'd been getting my annual mammograms, diagnostic imaging and biopsy. (When I found out I'd need a biopsy, I began checking out the various breast cancer specialists at that hospital system). I saw her five days later--but her first available surgery date was nearly a month out, which meant I wouldn't have finished my radiation treatments until mid-December. I told her my husband & I had booked a Mediterranean cruise for Dec. 12; she immediately made a call and traded a block of surgery time with her partner, and I had my surgery within the week. The fates cooperated: my lumpectomy had clear margins and SNLB was negative. The path report confirmed grade and hormone/HER2 status, and added that the mitotic score (how fast cells divide) was only 1, or slow-growing. But because the path report also said the tumor was 1.3cm, nearly twice what was originally estimated, my MO ordered an Oncotype DX; and because I'm Ashkenazi Jewish she also referred me for genetic counseling and BRCA, PALB and other mutation testing, despite my being diagnosed relatively late in life without a family history of breast or gyne cancer. (Had I tested positive, I'd have had bilateral mx without radiation, in order to be able to reconstruct right away; and I'd also have had my ovaries removed). She said she doubted I'd be positive for the mutations, nor that I'd need chemo. Nonetheless, because of my ethnicity and the tumor size, I was in that \u201cgray area\" where both tests were advisable. I hear you about waiting: 10 days for Oncotype results, and another 2 weeks after that for genetic test results. Fortunately, the news was good on both fronts, my surgeon said my incisions were healing nicely (despite developing a humdinger of a seroma at the sentinel-node site) and I was able to get my remaining steri-strips removed and meet with the RO to plan radiation. Got even better news--instead of 6 weeks of whole-breast rads, I was a candidate for the partial-breast, high-dose three-week protocol. Then the next day my SNLB incision popped open and my seroma burst--I had to get it sutured and keep the stitches in for two weeks. It took more waiting before the RO was able to assure me that since that incision was outside the radiation field, I could proceed with radiation as planned. I finished the Monday before Thanksgiving, and we went on that cruise. Now comes more waiting: just started anti-hormone (AI) therapy, on which I'll be for 5-10 years; have to wait till Feb. for my followup MO appt. (and need to discuss how to keep my recently-diagnosed osteopenia from turning into osteoporosis--for which I will have to wait to see a bone specialist to be the final arbiter). I don't get my followup mammogram till August, which seems like an eternity. The soundtrack to all of this has been Tom Petty's \u201cThe Waiting is the Hardest Part.\" So you're not alone!",

At a breast center, you would get a radiologist who does mostly breast ultrasounds, and (s)he would also do your biopsy. Unlike a general radiologist or general surgeon, breasts are all they treat--benign disorders as well as cancers. The more specific experience a provider has, the more accurate the diagnosis and ultimately the better the result. (And a \u201csebaceous\" cyst is usually palpable because it's filled with waxy-oily sebum secreted around hair follicles in your pores, and often hurts. It's essentially a zit that grows without fully coming to a head, and the pain is often from it stretching the skin. The finding was not consistent with a sebaceous cyst because they didn\u2019t find sebum. A 4mm mass like you have that is not felt but seen only on mammo or ultrasound might be a fluid-filled cyst, fibroadenoma (or other benign growth), atypical but not yet malignant cells, or some form of cancer (in situ or invasive). A specialty breast radiologist will hit his or her mark on core biopsy nearly all the time. Think of your upcoming visit as a reboot, and a chance for them to get it right this time.",

The actual raw difference was insufficient for me to choose mastectomy. Then I found out that the survival risk was identical, regardless of which option I chose. Now, a golf-ball-sized chunk taken out of the upper outside of an H/I cup breast would have left plenty of residual boobage, seroma or no--but little did I know that rads would make that breast BIGGER than the healthy one (at least for the next year or so)! Turns out, too, that I was node-negative, with clean margins. I am a surgery wuss--the less time under general anesthesia, and the easier and shorter recovery time, the better (at least for me). I had full range of motion, very little pain (wasn\u2019t even prescribed an opioid), no drains and no fatigue. I doubt whether any of that would have been the case had I opted for mastectomy--even without reconstruction. Now, mind you, I wouldn\u2019t have minded the tummy tuck that would have come with an abdominal fat reconstruction; but I would definitely have been given pause by being under the knife for seven hours and in severe pain not just in my chest but also my abdominal area. (Not to mention the prospect of cutting across my lower abs making it difficult to sing for a long time--I remember how long it took after a c-section to resume singing without pain and with sufficient vocal support). The prospect of tissue expanders, the fills over time, and the second exchange surgery did not appeal to me--but neither did having to deal with mastectomy forms and having to sew pockets into my bras. (I have sunk some serious coin into large-cup, pretty, European underwire bras over the past decade and I wasn\u2019t about to swap them out for mastectomy bras).

You already had mastectomy AND chemo and will likely go on hormone-suppression therapy, so you will likely not have high circulating estrogen levels. It is not precisely understood why fat cells produce estrogen or androstenedione, nor even which ones do, It could also be a self-perpetuating cycle in which certain women may be likelier than others to have their fat cells produce estrogen or its precursor. If fat cells were the main culprit in estrogen-positive cancers, surgeons would be advising women to have tummy-tucks and liposuctions prophylactically. Obviously, they aren't. There are even two different processes behind a person's % of body fat: hypertrophy and hyperplasty. Hypertrophic obesity is the most common kind (and the only kind men get): you have a set number of fat cells and whatever food becomes body fat goes into these fat cells, enlarging them. We women are unique in that we can also get hyperplastic obesity: we can actually make more fat cells when our existing ones fill up. Estrogen probably plays a role in that, as well as in women's higher levels of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, whose role is to make sure we have enough body fat for ovulation even long after menopause. Lipoprotein lipase is the culprit in increasing hunger and slowing metabolism after we've lost weight (especially body fat)--its job is to get our body fat % up to what Nature (which is thousands of years behind the times) feels is optimal for fertility. It does that primarily by making us hungry for foods that have been proven in the past to add body fat or at least keep it from declining. Because we don't know precisely which fat cells are and aren't involved in estrogen synthesis, doctors advise us to keep our weight (primarily body fat) down as much as possible--fat metabolism usually happens evenly all over the body. It could very well be that the belly fat used in DIEP flap reconstruction is endocrinologically inert, and perfectly safe to transfer from your belly to your chest. (It will always behave like belly fat, not mammary fat or buttock fat--all of which are of different composition and behave differently). Marijen, technically you are correct about sugar---but remember, EVERYTHING we ingest (even protein and fat) gets converted to some degree into sugar in the form of glucose. In peri-and-postmenopausal women (we\u2019re at the age when metabolic syndrome rears its three ugly heads), we are likelier to have more of that glucose converted to stored fat than to readily available glycogen for muscles to burn. (Both breast surgeons Elisa Port and Susan Love make the point that ALL cells depend on sugar to some degree, not just cancer cells). The wisest dietary advice is to know your own body, and limit or avoid those foods that you have found cause you to gain body fat. And nobody needs to eat sugar and starch--your body gets all it needs from the very complex carbs (fruits & vegetables) and proteins in your diet. Nobody ever died for lack of a slice of pizza, Supersize fries, or a Big Gulp Slurpee. (The only people who need simple sugars are diabetics who go into insulin shock, and in that case they need simple sugars VERY quickly and temporarily).",

The techs all said \u201csee you tomorrow,\" so no, I don't get Veterans Day off (maybe they'll all be wearing poppies on camo scrubs or something). And by Thanksgiving I will have been done three days earlier. The nausea I had Saturday was definitely NOT a SE--it was a combination of dehydration and hypoglycemia. I most assuredly am not losing my appetite--the staff at Hoosier Mama Pies can attest to that. Today I had 4 beams: one each from outside below the midpoint, straight on from the side, from outside above the breast and then directly above the nipple. Skin is still more tan than pink (amazing, since I always sunburn and never tan) and is not irritated. The Aquaphor I apply afterward and at night (as well as the aloe or calendula I apply at night) are, at this point, still preventive. The only thing about some of my bras that bothers me is that lace can be kind of scratchy, as can seams on the inside of the cups. I might temporarily cover those with silk tape. And I don't have that \u201cuh-oh, here comes a cold\" feeling in the back of my throat I had yesterday. First time that happened without taking anything other than saline nasal spray to ward it off--no vit. C or echinacea as I'm trying to avoid anything that might interfere with radiation destroying the cancer cells (if any). But what I'm wondering is whether there's anything I can do right now to address the osteopenia with which I've been diagnosed. From what I've read, I've been throwing my money away on (and wasting my energy chewing) Tums--calcium carbonate needs stomach acid in order to be absorbed (a cup of black coffee doesn't cut it) and the PPI I take (Dexilant) definitely reduces production of stomach acid. I went out and bought some calcium citrate instead--is it safe to take during radiation? And how long after radiation ends --if ever--will it be safe to resume antioxidants like C, Co-Q10, Krill oil, or alpha-lipoic acid?",

Although my armpit feels \u201ccrowded,\" it's not the SNB scar but rather Teenage Mutant Ninja Tit-tle being swollen due to its lateral third being essentially seroma surrounded by fat. But it might be shrinking a tad because my cleavage today was back to being perfectly centered. Even so, I'm going to schedule a lymphedema-therapist consult just to make sure that isn't a harbinger of LE. I am getting some tingling & pins & needles, but in both arms & hands. (I've had cervical-spine arthritis since I was 31). Still see veins & wrinkles in R hand and can make a fist and touch my thumb to the base of my pinky, but the R fingers don't feel as flexible as the L ones. Not surprising, though--the L is what I use to make chords and play notes on the fretboards of my stringed instruments, as I've done since I started playing guitar at 15. The R fingers don't stretch when picking--in fact they spend quite a bit of time holding a pick or curved as I fingerpick the strings. The boosts at the end of conventional whole-breast irradiation are very much like the 16 partial-breast external rad. treatments I am having, and the side effects thus far are quite minimal. (The breast seroma was probably percolating before I started radiation--maybe the rads enlarged it but it\u2019s equally likely it\u2019s been a combination of time & gravity). What I\u2019d perceived as redness is really below the skin surface--it\u2019s actually starting to tan a little . Because I\u2019m so pale, it showed up earlier than in most patients. Talked to my FP today--brought him up to speed on my progress. He says that before he takes a look at the little tan splotch (about the size of a baby aspirin) on my opposite breast I should run it by my RO himself, not just the RO's nurse. He also suggested that since I hadn't noticed it before, perhaps neither had my mammographer! He also says I should think long and hard before I take any bone-strengthening medicines, due to the severe fevers & aches from the injected/infused biologics and the horizontal femur fractures and massive esophagitis from the bisphosphonates (he's seen jaw necrosis and cancers in patients who've taken them). At the AAFP convention last summer, he learned of research that suggests that osteopenia doesn't necessarily progress to osteoporosis. I will discuss that with my MO in Feb. once I've had a month of Femara. My FP did say the SE's of AIs (all this alphabet soup!) can include hyperlipidemia and pre-diabetic glucose levels, but with an ER+ cancer they're pretty much my only option after menopause, and I'd need them only 5 years. I'll put up with having my own \u201cpersonal perennial summer,\" as he describes the hot flashes, if it means I get to live long enough to die of old age.",

Strain and sweeten (or not) to taste. Ginger ale (especially the boutique artisanal natural stuff) is also good, but you might want to stir it to dissipate the more robust carbonation. An alternative is mint tea (Celestial Seasoning's \u201cGrandma's Tummy Mint,\" Bigelow's \"Mint Medley,\" or steeping mint leaves in water. A drop or two of peppermint extract is a good addition). Over-the-counter Dramamine (aka \u201cGravol\" in Canada), Bonine, or the generic equivalents dimenhydrinate and meclizine also help. Meclizine (Bonine) also helps with vertigo. You might want to cut back on dairy and fats on your queasy days too. Steer clear of breathing VOC's: oil-based and acrylic paints, furniture polish, insect repellent, anti-mildew cleaners, nail enamel and removers, even fresh newsprint (printers' ink is petroleum distillate). Ditto for strong food odors you usually find objectionable (some people can't abide banana or raspberry)--if your stomach is even the slightest bit upset they might push it over the edge from mere distaste into nausea. And even if you normally tolerate alcohol well, it might nauseate you during rads. If you must ride, do it in the front seat and look straight ahead--don't read! (Motion sickness usually happens when your eyes, vestibular system and soles of your feet send you conflicting signals). And don't let yourself get dehydrated or hypoglycemic--both conditions can result in nausea.",

So no need to go up to a 22 or 24. I sleep at night in front-closing Playtex soft-cup bras in a 44DD (even though I\u2019m really a 38 I), or the Leading Lady stretch-knit front-close leisure bras in 40 F/G/H. The latter do tend to bind a bit, but the dart at the center of the cup going up to my nipple is leaving less of an indentation these days. Sometimes I leave the cami on overnight instead of a PJ top over a sleep bra. The Spanx I have are the ones with cutouts for bras. (A cami, bodysuit/tummy/thigh trimmer, and slip). No way I can squeeze into a Spanx cami without the cutout. I was one of those who did get enlargement after radiation. Before rads, I did develop a large enough seroma in the tumor cavity that despite having a chunk removed the size of a Double Stuf Oreo, left my lumpectomy breast the same size and shape it was pre-op. But just the first two radiation treatments (remember, I had the higher-dose short partial-breast protocol) caused the seroma to enlarge and by the end of rads it was obvious that my breast was now fuller on the outside than before--with definite hardening. My RO, PCP, and BS\u2019 nurse all say it\u2019s still just a radiated seroma, but I am seeing an LE specialist this Tuesday about it. I\u2019d originally booked the appt. when I began experiencing twinges of soreness and a palpable knot (not a \u201ccord\u201d) on the inside of my forearm when outstretched--especially when rotated clockwise. That\u2019s gone away, but I want to set my mind at ease anyway. He wants to see my sleeve, gauntlet and whatever bras and compression I\u2019m using on my breast. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to tell me to lose the underwire bras, and with my size breasts that is going to leave me few if any alternatives. No way I can let them just hang, and nothing else will adequately support them. I\u2019ve been to two breast cancer-specific lingerie boutiques in the Chicago area. The one where I got the Amoena camis, Second Act, has no bras larger than DD (and few of those, only for mastectomy patients), so the camis were my only option. And Schwartz\u2019 is staffed by extremely elderly ladies who tried to tell me I\u2019m really just a 42DDD and that \u201cnobody is an H or I cup, the expensive lingerie boutiques measure everybody too big in the cup and too small in the band.\u201d Of course--because with rare exceptions--the stiff scratchy Elila 40G Sherman tank they crammed me into--they carry nothing bigger than DDD. (And though the girls are mostly contained in a 42DDD, the band rides up in the back and the center gapes).",

Next best is Novartis\u2019 brand-name Femara (ridiculously overpriced), then Teva (generally the easiest-to-tolerate generic drugs across the board, not just AIs). Some people do okay with Accord, but Sun is usually the roughest to handle. Some people report relief of bone pain during chemo, after Prolia/Xgeva shots or Zometa infusions, and from AIs, with OTC loratidine--whether Claritin or generic. Not sure if loratidine is unique or cetirizine (Zyrtec, same class of non-drowsy long-acting antihistamines) would work as well. 2 ibuprofen every 12 hrs. is way too low a dose of NSAIDs to maintain a clinically-effective blood level of the drug. It is supposed to be taken every 4-6 hrs., as is ES Tylenol. They are two different classes of drugs, so you don't need to alternate between them (indeed, you are probably wasting your money by doing so). When I was rehabbing after my knee replacement surgeries and weaned off opioids, tramadol and gabapentin, an orthopedic-surgery nurse in the UK who helped found the Bonesmart.org website and moderated its discussion boards came up with a combo she called the \u201cBonesmart Cocktail:\" two each ES Tylenol and ibuprofen every 6 hrs. If you want to take an NSAID only twice a day, switch to naproxen sodium (Aleve or OTC generic). You can safely take up to 4 gm. (4000 mg) of Tylenol a day, but some authorities recommend not exceeding 3 gm., especially if you have liver issues. You might want to, instead of two ES Tylenol every 4-6 hrs, take two 650 mg. \"Arthritis Formula\" time-release acetaminophen every 8-10 hr. I take two of those at bedtime and switch to one 200 mg. celecoxib (aka Celebrex, not yet OTC) in the morning--as a COX-2 inhibitor, it is a much gentler NSAID on your gut. I don't have bone pain per se, as I'm only on letrozole (just joint pain); but it definitely helps ameliorate my hip pain from the bursitis caused by a gluteal injury 2 yrs ago, my stiff lower back, any residual knee or thigh ache (despite having \"bionic knees\") and especially my trigger thumb from letrozole.",

Though I wish I\u2019d done it earlier, and glad I did it, there are still very real complications such as infection, DVT (or even PEi) and possibly having to go for revision surgery should infection happen or trauma loosens the implant. One is also under general anesthesia for 2-4 hrs, or longer, a hospital stay of at least 48 hrs (if not longer) is necessary, and often an inpatient rehab stay of 10-14 days if it is impossible (say, because of stairs to the front door and/or lack of transportation) to go for PT and OT twice a day. (Initial PT often requires equipment most people\u2019s homes lack). If joint pain is symmetrical and evenly distributed over most types of joints, OA is highly unlikely, and AIs a more likely culprit. And so is RA if there is no deformation of the joints (and blood tests rule it out). And pain management is still important for both types of arthritis.",

Here in IL, it is impossible to get more than one month's worth per prescription; no refills; no calling in an Rx, but having to visit one's physician (for which you must pay then & there or be billed) and bring a paper prescription into the pharmacy\u2026and then having to make a pest of yourself and letting the line pile up behind you by insisting the pills be counted out one by one in front of you before you pay for them and leave (shortchanging has happened to a friend of mine with chronic cluster headaches several times now, the last time caught on camera)\u2026lather, rinse, repeat every 30 days. Eventually, when the pain-in-the-@$ becomes worse than the actual pain, patients turn to easier and illicit sources; when those run out or get too expensive, it's on to heroin and now fentanyl. I won't even get into the problem of those who are addicted long after they no longer have pain\u2014only that the early motivation for wanting to \u201cescape\" that led to addiction needs to be explored psychiatrically and treated medically, not punished. I don't have chronic pain any more and I don't need opioids, thank heavens. But I had my R knee replaced in 2012 and my L one in 2013. Both times, I needed long-acting hydromorphone (Opana) every day for two weeks and two 10 mg. Norco every 6 hrs for four weeks (including the time I was on Opana), plus gabapentin & tramadol for the first three weeks. (Because of stairs to my front door making twice-daily outpatient PT visits impossible, I was in in-patient rehab 10 days the first time and 2 weeks the second). And because I developed severe GERD in the year between surgeries due to transitioning to NSAIDs after weaning off the Norco, my second rehab required a longer weaning-off period because I couldn't sub out Advil or Aleve. But never did I have any problems getting Norco\u2014each script had refills that only had to be confirmed via fax from my doctor. Even 2 years ago, when my husband had a perforated bowel after a botched colonoscopy (requiring three hospital admissions before they did a hemicolectomy, followed w/in three weeks by an emergency hernia repair), the surgeon prescribed a months' worth of Norco, with a refill, without hesitation. I shudder to think of how much harder my recovery from knee replacement surgery (or my husband's recovery from gut surgery) would be today with the crackdown on lawfully and legitimately prescribed opioids. And I am hoping I never have to get my hips replaced if I have to substitute mindfulness meditation because of mindless restrictions on medication! And I'm sorry, but this business of \u201cmarijuana is a dangerous drug,\" possibly to the point of Federally arresting patients with valid state permits for possession of medical marijuana in their own states, is purely a combination of moral sanctimoniousness and the profit motive of packing private prisons as if they were sardine-tins. You have my complete sympathy\u2014and I share your indignation. (And no, I don't do weed either, not even medical which is legal here in IL). When will those in power grow some compassion? And when will patients who need real pain management stop getting lumped in with the addicts?",

Same goes for pet scratches & bites, brushing up bare-armed against brambles or thorns, paper cuts, even minor scrapes & burns. Any breach of the skin on that side has the potential to become a life-threatening cellulitis, especially if you have already developed LE. If you plan to take a flight >4 hours long, get measured for and purchase a compression sleeve and gauntlet far enough in advance to be able to exchange it for one that fits. If you don't yet have LE and want to do upper-body resistance or weight training, wear compression and start with the lightest possible weight or resistance and work up gradually. Get a medical-alert bracelet with an LE warning (and drug allergy and any other chronic conditions if you have them)and wear it on that wrist. Make sure the emblem is pink because that's how emergency personnel and nurses are trained to recognize an LE risk. Your doctor probably had little to no lymph system education in med school. I was lucky to be at a cancer center and hospital with two LE specialist doctors & two LE PT/OTs, so my surgeon and her NP were attuned to the risk and my arm & hand were measured even before surgery.

      "Content": "Dec 7, 2015 06:15PM - edited Dec 7, 2015 06:28PM by ChiSandy I can only reiterate what my RO told me: because of my age, overall tumor profile, negative nodes/clean margins, tumor size relative to my breast size (and there's quite a difference between DD and H/I), and tumor location he concluded that whole-breast radiation would not be necessary; and that for patients like me (age 60+, slow-growing small tumors) 16 stronger treatments were as effective as 33 standard ones. He gave me a choice between the two protocols, and I opted for the shorter high-dose partial-breast one. The fact that he had participated in the recently-concluded multi-center trial--which trial confirmed what he had told me--was the clincher for me. Obviously, had my entire breast (rather than the tumor cavity and a small additional margin) needed irradiation, the higher dose would have been a problem. But because my tumor was located less than 2cm beneath the skin and on the upper outer quadrant, it was in an ideal location for partial-breast irradiation. As to breast care, both he and the techs & nurses told me that I likely wouldn\u2019t have to use the Aquaphor they gave me, but so long as I didn\u2019t apply it within 4 hrs. before treatment it wouldn\u2019t hurt. (Remember because my breast center took part in the trial they\u2019d had specific experience from which to refer regrading this protocol). He did offer me a prescription for a steroid cream were I to need it, but I never did so I didn\u2019t request it. I followed the lead of a friend of mine up in MI, who began using aloe as soon as her first treatment was done and applied it consistently twice a day. My routine was to apply Aquaphor in the changing room, and at bedtime for the first two weeks to apply first aloe or calendula and then Aquaphor. The third week I used aloe at night and Aquaphor in the changing room. I can\u2019t say whether that was what kept my skin from breaking down, itching or hurting--pretty sure it was a combination of that, the shorter duration and narrower field (the under-bust, sternal juncture and axilla were all outside the field). I didn\u2019t need to stop using antiperspirant because the axilla wasn\u2019t irradiated. I had no problem with skin-to-skin contact because I never went braless except in the shower, but again that part of my breast also wasn\u2019t irradiated. Had no skin breakdown of the crease beneath the breast nor irritation from bras (wired or not) for that same reason. But from what I\u2019ve been reading here, mine was a rather unusual and fortuitous situation--and I\u2019m probably the exception to the rule.",

You should ask what grade and the hormone & HER2 status of your tumor are, based on your biopsy path report. (It, as well as size, could change in the post-op report). As to OncotypeDX, it's way too soon to ask. It needs to be done on tumor tissue removed from your surgery, because: that pathology is more definitive than initial biopsy tissue; you need to know your lymph node status, which is usually determined by sentinel-node biopsy, because it isn't ordered in women with 3 or more positive nodes (until recently, test-eligible women had to be node-negative); and generally limited to IDC (another version is for DCIS). ILC because of its shape and growth pattern tends to be bigger than IDC (so don't panic over the size), and it's tougher to get clean margins in ILC with a lumpectomy, which is why mastectomy might be recommended. You might also ask what your reconstruction options are--whether to see a plastic surgeon and if (s)he will be in the OR during your mastectomy or lumpectomy, and if for symmetry's sake your healthy breast will need any modification.",

Great idea to train before surgery, before you have post-op pain and might not be in any mood to use the thing. It usually has three tubes, each containing a mini-ping-pong ball, and a flexible hose with mouthpiece you blow into. The goal is to raise and then keep the balls as high up in the tubes for as long as you can for each breath. It\u2019s a lovely souvenir you get to take home with you. CTCA is cutting-edge and will do right by you. Its facilities are quite posh too. If you\u2019re not from Chicago, you picked a fantastic week weather-wise\u2014we seem to be doing a credible impression of San Diego. The chemo recommendation is probably because of your low PR % as well as your relatively young age. Good call on the genetic-mutation testing too (especially if you\u2019re from an ethnic group\u2014e.g., Ashkenazi Jewish--with a higher incidence of BRCA 1 & 2), given your family history. Had mine come back positive, I too would have gone back in for a BMX. You got this\u2014and we have your back and are in your pocket. (Metaphor trifecta).",

Even before my lumpectomy my BS\u2019 NP wrote me an Rx for a sleeve & gauntlet--insisting I fill it close to the day I was to depart on a trip to Italy & Spain that would require long flights between Amsterdam & the US. I had lumpectomy on the upper outer quadrant of my R breast, with SNB (2 sentinel and 2 \u201chitchhiker\u201d nodes removed, all negative). I developed a breast seroma (initially invisible and asymptomatic) and an SNB one that by 3 wks post-op was the size of a tangerine or even a small orange (felt like I was wearing a shoulder holster). After I got the OK to remove the remaining Steri-Strips, the weight of my very large breast (D6, acc. to universal cup sizing) pulled the SNB incision (glued, not sutured) open and the seroma gushed like Old Faithful. BS\u2019 partner squooshed out as much fluid as he could and agreed it needed to be sutured (said that if he\u2019d done my lx he would have called in a PS to do a bilateral reduction down to no bigger than a DD). I filled the scrip (Juzo Soft, level 1, med/max top/regular length silicone band for sleeve and size S for gauntlet). but saved it for my trip. But w/in a week after rads ended, in the shower when I reached for my bath sponge I felt a painful pulling in the inside surface of my forearm, and I could actually palpate a knot. Before leaving for Europe, I made an appt. with the top LE doc in town. Two days before departing, I felt a pop and suddenly I had full painless ROM again. An hour before the transatlantic flight, I donned the sleeve and gauntlet. Felt okay in flight but hadn\u2019t realized I'd have enough time in Schipol before the final flight to Rome to be able to remove them, so I kept them on till we collected our bags and walked the half-mile to our hotel. I was fine. But the third day of our cruise we were on a shore excursion to Taormina, Sicily--a mile up in the mts. Hadn\u2019t thought to wear compression nor even keep it in my purse. By the time we got back on the bus, my arm felt heavy and tight--and as we descended I actually felt it \u201cdeflate:\u201d by the time we re-boarded our ship in Messina it was back to normal and remained fine the rest of our time in Europe. When we landed in Amsterdam from our short flight from Barcelona, I had just about an hour to don the sleeve & gauntlet. This time we had to fly first to Detroit before heading to Chicago. This flight, though shorter-distance, was an hour longer than Chi-Amsterdam. Halfway through, I noticed my fingers felt swollen--my ring, which sometimes even slips off, had to be twisted off as hard as my smaller engagement and wedding rings on my L. (I wondered if it was the salty airplane food and the peanuts). Kept my LE doc appt. in early Jan., feeling kinda sheepish about even seeing him because my LE and cording symptoms hadn\u2019t recurred. He took measurements and attributed the difference between the arms to my R hand being dominant, but noticed my L fingers could stretch further (probably because they've had to make chords on a guitar neck for decades). He also hit the ceiling when I showed him my compression set--\u201cI never prescribe compression to someone who had only 4 nodes out, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need to wear it in-flight without having been diagnosed with LE.\u201d But because I described having had symptoms, and so that Medicare would pay for therapy, he diagnosed me with stage 0 LE and insisted I trash the gauntlet and get a glove instead. He prescribed the Mediven Harmony glove--frighteningly expensive, even more than a sleeve. No measurements--just that it be \u201ccomfortable.\" Went to the medical supply shop he recommended. First red flag was that they had nothing in stock except display (not even fitting) samples and had to order everything, so I couldn\u2019t tell if the glove would fit, much less be comfortable. Next was that they suggested that since I wanted a second sleeve to wear while the other was in the wash, I should get a Mediven rather than another Juzo, because their beiges don\u2019t match. The fitter looked at my Juzo, measured me, and ordered a size M, reg. top, no silicone. I decided I wanted something badass-looking for my upcoming gig (since I was told to wear compression when playing guitar). I asked if they had anything in colors or patterns, and they said if I wanted it faster I should order it directly from LympheDivas. So I ordered the Music City tattoo-pattern sleeve in M regular and the glove in S. They arrived a week later (before the Mediven), but the sleeve was ridiculously long (extending into my armpit) and so was the glove--its open fingertips extended 1/2\u201d past the tips of my fingernails. Called LympheDivas and the rep confirmed that I should have ordered a M short sleeve. But they didn\u2019t have shorter-fingered gloves, advised me not to fold over the fingertips lest I get excessive compression, and warned me that trimming the tips would cause the fingers to unravel and run. They also told me they don\u2019t do custom sizes in gloves. So I reluctantly returned the set for a shorter sleeve and matching gauntlet instead of the glove (still waiting for them to arrive--just shipped yesterday). My therapist kinesio-taped my hand & forearm so I could safely play that night in glove and gauntlet--and I did fine. Next morning the Mediven set arrived...the glove was stiff and thick and the thumb almost too long, and the sleeve very long and too tight at the top. Took them to my Thurs. therapy session, where the therapist said that although the glove fit the way a Mediven was supposed to, the fitter should have ordered the sleeve with an extra-wide top band. So I called the shop and they said they\u2019d order the wider-top one and would tell me when to return the too-tight one. But though I could cook with the glove on, it was too stiff for playing guitar (at least for fingerpicking) and I couldn\u2019t work a smartphone or touchpad because the fabric was too thick and fingers too long for my gestures to register. Meanwhile, a week ago Friday I was checking my other guitars to see how they\u2019ve held up in winter dryness (my humidifier croaked and the little soundhole humidifiers weren\u2019t up to the task, especially in guitars I\u2019d forgotten to transfer back to hard shell cases from cloth \u201cgig bags\u201d). One was in a heavy fiberglass flight case, propped against a wall. I hoisted it no more than 5 ft. onto my couch. It was fine...but my arm began to swell that evening. Next day I couldn\u2019t raise my hand and dorsiflex my wrist. Did MLD and hoped it\u2019d be ok. But Sunday night I grated hard cheese, opened a jar and scooped ice cream. I awoke Mon. morning unable to even touch my forearm skin to do MLD, much less my prescribed stretch & resistance exercises. Had to have help carrying the three cracked guitars down the stairs and from the car to the shop. My LE therapist was shocked Tues. by the swelling, and advised me to wear compression most of my waking hours (except for showering and doing MLD) till I got relief. Wed. the replacement Mediven sleeve came: it was very long and still felt too tight at the top. My therapist had me try to put it on using a \u201cslippie,\u201d and it still kept rolling down and binding. It was then she noticed its top was still smaller than my Juzo's. That was it. I went to the original breast cancer boutique that sold me the Juzo set and bought another sleeve and two gloves. And then I drove a few blocks to the medical supply place and returned the Mediven sleeves. So I\u2019ll have two well-fitting comfy sets for everyday and one decorative one for performing. Since Thursday\u2019s therapy session I\u2019ve had a long stretch (knock wood) of \u201cgood LE days.\u201d I have full painless ROM in my arm & hand, my R hand ring once again falls off more than it stays on. Haven\u2019t needed to put compression on (but no guarantee I won\u2019t). At tonight\u2019s neighborhood restaurant\u2019s staff-and-friends Super Bowl party, I was talking to the hostess (the co-owner\u2019s sister and a former flight attendant). She\u2019s a six-year survivor (ER+ IDC, 5mm, grade 1, 2 nodes out, a month of rads, and on a 10-yr course of Arimidex). We compared Medic-Alert LE bracelets. I was surprised she had LE--she\u2019s petite and slender. She said she had breast LE too while she was still flying. I\u2019m beginning to think that LE is much, much commoner among bc survivors than published risk stats would indicate!",

At my 2-week followup, I asked the BS\u2019 NP if I should have the seroma drained and remove that incision\u2019s Steri-Strips, but she nixed both (\u201cyou\u2019ll get an infection if we drain it, and you need to wait for the strips to peel and start curling before you remove them\u201d). A week later, I went for my initial RO consult. The RO looked at my breast and removed the Steri-Strips, saying they\u2019d curled enough. But three days after that, I was leaning over the bathroom sink to brush my teeth and I heard a hissing that sounded exactly like that when my recently-deceased elder cat would pee against vertical surfaces. I turned to scold whichever of my two surviving cats was doing that (neither ever had), but there was no cat in the room. I then felt my blouse on the right side had gotten wet......but no, I hadn\u2019t turned the taps on yet. It was only when I looked down at the pink rug on the floor and saw blood dripping on it that I realized what happened: my incision had opened and the seroma had exploded.

I smooshed a washcloth and then a towel against my boob and put an old hoodie on over it (blood-colored, it turned out) and called the hospital--the idiot operator kept me on hold ten minutes before telling me there was no nurse on call available to speak to me, and took a message.

Took over half an hour, as we (my housekeeper drove me because I was not about drive) were stuck behind a moron who kept texting. The NP said, \u201cOh, these things happen. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I asked her what about her prior warning that draining the seroma would cause an infection--and she repeated, \u201cyou\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019ll just clean, pack and dress the wound and show you how to change it.\u201d Say WHA??? \u201cIt has to heal from the inside out, and it\u2019ll be a few weeks\u201d she replied. I had a conference to attend in Iowa and was not about to walk around with gauze stuffed into a gaping wound for weeks--gauze that\u2019d have to be changed several times a day. I asked why it couldn\u2019t be sutured, and she sniffed and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go get the other surgeon.\u201d He came in and whistled. \u201cStruck a gusher, eh?\u201d I asked him if he could suture it and he replied, \u201cWell, of course. But first I have to express it.\" I didn\u2019t feel a thing, not even the Lidocaine he injected. But I heard a disgusting hissing gooshing sound, and he got about another half-cup of fluid before suturing it closed. I asked why it had popped after my RO declared it safe enough to remove the Steri-Strips, and he said it was the weight of my oversized breast that pulled it open--and that despite weeks of packing, it probably wouldn\u2019t have healed, and probably would have gotten infected to boot. Since I wear a 38 I bra size, I asked if I should have gotten a reduction along with the lumpectomy. Ever the diplomat (my surgeon is his partner), he replied, \u201cWell, you weren\u2019t my patient then, and that\u2019s water under the bridge.\u201d When I got the sutures removed 2 weeks later, the incision had fully healed. I asked my surgeon about reduction, and she shot down the idea, saying it would have been a long and painful recovery and might have resulted in more seromas. Meanwhile, the seroma has shrunken to less than the size of a soybean, and mammography a few weeks ago confirmed it\u2019s just a tiny seroma and not an enlarged node. One good thing came of it, though. After getting home from the suturing (stopping first at Hoosier Mama to console myself with the first of an ill-advised post-treatment series of slices of Smores cream pies--which series lasted through my radiation treatments--that added 10 lbs.) I googled \u201cexploding SNB seroma\u201d and up popped a link to a bco post titled \u201cM-m-m-My Seroma\u201d (remember The Knack?). And so I discovered bco, joining a couple months after my diagnosis and surgery. Wish I\u2019d known about it when I first had my diagnostic imaging done and biopsy scheduled: the uncertainty ruined an otherwise perfect trip to New Orleans, Scranton and a folk festival--all I could think of in all through the music law course lectures, wonderful meals, and in between my gigs was \u201cI might have cancer. What if it\u2019s cancer? OMG, I bet I have cancer--what will happen to me and my family?\u201d playing in an endless loop. I could have had all of you here to calm me down and give me solid information and distraction.",

As to hair, you might want to look into \"cold caps\" (FDA approved as safe and expensive). They're a pain in the butt to use, costly and uncomfortable while wearing them (from just before to a few hours after each chemo session), but they've been proven to reduce hair loss by half. If you already have thick hair, cold caps can still leave you with enough hair to look normal. Some insurers cover part of them, some won't. As to wigs, have your oncologist write a prescription for a \"cranial prosthesis.\" That way, insurance will cover it, if the wig salon accepts your insurance. There are specialized wig salons for cancer patients (they also sell prostheses, compression garments for lymphedema, mastectomy bras and even camisoles that can hold a prosthesis). Don't worry about changing your diet, except for cutting way back on alcohol if you do drink, because ER+ breast cancer patients are advised to have no more than 2 or 3 \"drinks\" (5 oz. of wine, 12 oz. of beer or hard cider, 1 oz. hard liquor) a week due to alcohol inhibiting the liver from clearing estrogen from the bloodstream. As to what to eat, follow common sense for your particular situation (if you tend towards higher blood sugar or if diabetes runs in your family, simple carbs are worse than fats). Fruits & vegetables are a good idea for everyone. I buy organic not just because it is probably safer, but just plain tastes better. If you eat dairy, meat or poultry (including eggs), make sure it's organic with no growth hormones, and raised on pastures--rather than \"battery\" chicken barns or feedlots. Beef, if you eat it, should be 100% grass-fed. You aren't just what you eat--you are what you eat eats. Carbs should be as complex and unprocessed as possible too. Dietary fat is not the demon that doctors used to believe, nor is dietary cholesterol. With ER+ cancer, though, you need to try to maintain your current body weight (and if overweight, try to lose some of it before treatment begins). Steroids are usually given to lessen chemo's side effects, and after chemo you will be put on an anti-estrogen pill (which kind depends on your menstrual status and what you want to do about it). Steroids & anti-estrogen drugs lower metabolism and make weight loss, or even maintenance, difficult. I know it's hard to believe after all those images of the emaciated cancer patient, but with breast cancer you are likely to gain weight, most of it body fat. And even if you no longer have functioning ovaries, your fat cells and adrenal glands make a hormone that an enzyme from your liver converts into estrogen. You can't do anything about your adrenal glands (we all need those), but you should try to keep from adding more fat cells. As to antioxidants, do not take them as supplements, just in foods in normal amounts. This is important during chemo & radiation, because the point of those treatments is to destroy the tumor cells. Just as chemo drugs can't tell the difference between tumor cells and fast-dividing normal cells (like hair follicles, etc.), neither can antioxidants. Antioxidants mop up free radicals, and free radicals damage cells. While you are doing chemo & rads (\"adjuvant\" treatment, and if in your case pre-surgery, \"neo-adjuvant\" treatment) you want to damage those cancer cells! Neo-adjuvant chemo serves three purposes: first, to shrink tumors to a size that can facilitate lumpectomy (and also shrink or eliminate tumor cells in lymph nodes); second, to get a head start on killing any stray tumor cells that may have escaped your breasts & lymph nodes and prevent further spread; and third, to gauge which chemo regimens will work best for your tumors. (\"Pathological response\" is the term).",

Soursop can't hurt you, but will do NOTHING to treat or prevent recurrence. Drink it for the taste if you like it. Or eat soursops. Bitter apricot seeds are POISON--they have cyanide; and the quack-remedy Laetrile (which saved nobody and may have killed other patients sooner than conventional treatment) was made from apricot pits & seeds. (Eat apricots instead and stay away from the seeds). Apples, ginger, parsley and carrots are fine (eat fruits & veggies) but they have nothing to do with cancer. Eating turmeric may taste good and taking turmeric supplements (which won't be absorbed unless you take piperine, aka black pepper extract) might be anti-inflammatory, but again, it doesn't treat cancer. Mushrooms? Eat mushrooms if you like them, but don't take mushroom powders or supplements. They do nothing constructive. Look, the problem with all these \"natural\" and herbal remedies is not only are they wholly unproven (because there are no scientifically controlled double-blind studies) but also wholly unregulated--thanks to the supplement lobby, which has poured billions of $ into campaign funds for political candidates, usually on one side of the aisle--which side BCO rules keep me from mentioning, but they tend to be candidates who hate government regulations that eat into profits. They're a smaller lobby than pharma, but every bit as powerful & influential, and dead-set against being regulated, regardless of consumer safety. So you don't (and can't really) know what else is in those teas and pills and powders, or how much of the claimed ingredients they contain. You will doubtless hear quacks (and their followers) as well as aging hippies (disclosure: I was a hippie back in the day but I grew up and got real) disparage controlled double-blind studies because \"Big Pharma\" and the \"medical lobby\" can't make money off anything they can't patent. Any articles you find touting this stuff are fraudulent, theoretical, or at least from unscientific \"alternative\" sites. (The \"science\" they may use to back up their results is also suspect and bears no relation to established biology or chemistry). Whenever you see a website or a book or article claiming \"(insert name) Beat Cancer\" or with the words \"What Doctors Don't Want You to Know,\" or \"The Truth About,\" run the other way. And listen for the sounds of ducks (quack). Dig a little deeper and you may find links to conspiracy-theory websites (anti-vax, anti-fluoride, even political lunatics on both sides of the spectrum). Read BCO, Komen, BCRF, ACS, Dr. Susan Love Foundation websites. Read actual respected medical journal articles if you can access them. And get a copy (hardcover or e-reader) of the most recent edition of Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book. It remains the definitive \"Bible\" for breast cancer patients (and friends, family & caregivers). Another good one, though shorter, is by Dr. Elisa Port (also a renowned breast cancer surgeon). And ask those of us who've been through or are going through treatment. (The soundest scientific advice comes from a member who calls herself BarredOwl. She claims she's not a scientist, but I beg to differ). As to \"natural,\" \"herbal,\" and \"plant-based\" remedies being superior or at least harmless, know that many conventional drugs came from plants: aspirin, digitalis, castor oil, mustard (an early form of chemo), and most recently taxanes (Taxol, Taxotere). And of course, many poisons are also \"herbal\" or \"natural\" in origin: castor beans, oleander, nightshade, morning glory, jimson weed, and the aforementioned cyanide. I get it. Cancer is scary. Chemo is an ordeal. Radiation is no walk in the park. And anti-hormonals do have unpleasant and some not-so-healthy side effects. But the vast majority of us in these forums got through conventional treatment and are here to tell you about it, and will be for a good long time, perhaps the rest of a normal lifespan. The same can't be said for those who stuck with \"natural\" and \"alternative\" (as opposed to \"complementary\") treatments. There have been numerous retrospective studies (no, not funded by drug companies) all demonstrating that those who chose alternative rather than conventional or complementary therapies do not live as long and also have more suffering during their metastatic phases than those who stuck with the tried & true. It's always wise to eat sensibly--especially with ER+ cancers, which feed off estrogen (and which your body fat can make even if your ovaries bit the dust long ago). It can't hurt. And anti-estrogen therapies tend to lower metabolism and lead to weight gain if you aren't careful (and I wasn't careful). Your risk of lymphedema rises if you're obese. So if you can't lose weight (or don't need to yet), don't gain any. But all those herbs, teas and supplements are not \"clean\" unless you can confirm every link in the supply chain from growing to harvest to production to packaging--and even those mfrs. who claim to police themselves answer to no one. Now that's scary. Eating foods containing antioxidants is fine (but go easy during radiation or chemo). Do NOT take antioxidant supplements during radiation or chemo because antioxidants prevent cell damage--and cell damage is the whole point of radiation & chemo. Ask your MO what foods you should or shouldn't eat for your type of breast cancer and with the drugs you may be taking. There are no guarantees that if you do conventional therapies that you will never get a recurrence. But going the alternative route is far likelier to result in a recurrence. If you still insist on all that woo-woo stuff, there is an Alternative Medicine forum or two on BCO, where those of us who think it's b.s. are not allowed to disparage those who think it's their salvation. But do know that the Moderators, in creating those \"safe harbors,\" expressly state that they are NOT endorsing or recommending alternative medicine or shunning conventional treatments. And if you post about alternative and \"natural\" treatments anywhere but there, do expect your choices will not be immune from disagreement or criticism. Just sayin'... That being said, welcome aboard on this journey nobody wants to take. ",

But I think that everyone's body is different, and there may be predisposing factors that affect the size and duration of seromas. I remembered that I also had a \"small seroma\" (as my radiologist described at the time she implanted my pre-op radioactive seed) at the core biopsy site, which explains why I'd panicked in the two weeks between biopsy and lumpectomy over a pea-sized lump that I'd feared was a new tumor. But in retrospect, I realize that the main reason may be that I have a hair-trigger immune system: not only do I get seasonal allergic rhinitis at the drop of a tree blossom (or weed pollen grain or mold spore), but I have very sensitive skin and form blisters at the slightest provocation. (Shoe salesmen duck behind the counter in terror when I walk in, because I reject shoe after shoe that has any sharp edge, seam or protruding stitch, insisting that it'd inevitably cause a blister). I can wear the most cushioned running or walking shoe and thick wicking socks, but unless I pre-bandage my trouble spots securely I will still get a painful blister that has to be babied lest it pop and get infected--and sometimes it'll pop anyway. And what is a blister, after all, but a small seroma that develops between the dermis and epidermis? The difference is merely one of scale. Just as your body responds to the irritation of your skin by cloaking it in fluid to soothe and protect it from further injury, so too does it respond to the injuries it has perceived to your axillary lymph node area and breast tissue surrounding the area from which your tumor and margin tissue have been removed. So I don't want to be Debbie Downer, but if you habitually get blisters, you will probably get a seroma or two--and draining them will not prevent their refilling. Your body wants to do what it wants to do, and all you can do in response is to manage your seromas to keep them from getting worse and help them to resorb on their own. You have to adapt, and above all be patient.",

The reason is that even with negative nodes and clear margins, one can never be sure that there are no residual \u201cmicrometastases\u201d in either the breast or elsewhere in the body, to continue growing and become either a new tumor or distant metastases. So there are two types of postoperative \u201cadjuvant\u201d treatments: local and systemic. Unless you are well past 70, and had extremely small DCIS, if you had a lumpectomy you will almost certainly be advised to have radiation, as \u201clocal\u201d therapy. It is designed to directly destroy those micromets most likely to remain after your tumor was removed: the ones still hiding out in your breast. Depending on how aggressive your tumor, its size and location and your age, you might be offered a shorter course of higher intensity partial-breast radiation, to just the tumor cavity and a small margin around it. Radiation is usually not given if you had a mastectomy--but it\u2019s still administered if there were positive lymph nodes and/or tumor cells found on or near the chest wall. You might also (probably most of us almost certainly) have some micromets that made it past your lymph nodes and into your body. Therapy to kill them is called \u201csystemic.\u201d If your tumor had a certain profile that indicated it was likely to be aggressive, and/or your OncotypeDX (if needed & offered) score confirms it, then you will be urged to have chemo--since cytotoxic (cell-poisoning) drugs given as chemo are most effective in killing those fast-dividing (and thus aggressively-growing) cells. If your tumor\u2019s profile indicated it was slow-growing and was positive for estrogen & progesterone receptors, and/or your OncotypeDX (if needed & offered) indicated it was non-aggressive, you would be advised to go on endocrine therapy. Hormone-receptor-positive tumor cells are too slow-growing to be vulnerable to chemo drugs, and the risks to you from chemo would outweigh the benefits. These tumor cells feed on estrogen. So instead of \u201cslash/burn/poison\u201d of surgery/radiation/chemo, your treatment plan would be \u201cslash/burn/starve\u201d--by depriving tumor cells of estrogen they would starve to death. Why, if these cells are so slow-growing and non-aggressive in the first place, would you even need to kill them in the first place? Because, given enough time untreated, they could still grow and spread to your bones and organs, eventually killing you. It\u2019d just take a long time. And some tumor cells, even if hormone-receptor-positive, have more aggressive features (e.g., Grade 3, spread to more than a couple of lymph nodes, large size, HER2 positive), you would get chemo first to kill the most aggressive cells, then radiation to kill what\u2019s hiding out in your breast, and finally endocrine therapy (5-10 yrs) to starve the slow-growing stragglers to death before they can become a tumor and spread. Endocrine therapy will depend on how close to menopause you are (or if you\u2019re past it). If you\u2019re not done with menopause yet, you\u2019d get Tamoxifen and maybe some other drug to shut your ovaries down permanently or temporarily. If you\u2019re postmenopausal, you won\u2019t need anything to suppress your ovaries; and instead of Tamoxifen--which blocks access to the estrogen receptors--you\u2019d get an aromatase inhibitor, which neutralizes the enzyme that helps your fat cells and adrenal glands convert the hormones they make into estrogen. There are other considerations your doctor will explain more fully. It\u2019s still your call, but you need to know why certain treatments are recommended for you so you can make an informed rather than just a visceral decision.",

Last time it had slipped below 12 (found out when I was rejected as a blood donor) in 2013; my PCP had a hunch and ordered an upper GI endoscopy, or \u201cEGD\" (the one I had two years earlier along with my colonoscopy showed some gastric and esophageal irritation). Sure enough, it revealed a \"small area of esophageal irritation, likely of chemical origin,\" which made sense since I had taken NSAIDs daily as part of rehabbing from knee replacement surgery after giving up opioids. Also showed a hiatal hernia (which I'd suspected for >20 yrs). So with my long history of GERD, I'm getting a repeat EGD Aug.3 (the first date I could get) to see if there's a new GI bleed. If it's negative, then I do a \u201ccapsule\" endoscopy (swallow a pill containing a camera). If it shows nothing, then it's possible that radiation may have affected my bone marrow. Possible, but unlikely: my RBC & WBC are normal, as are my various cell type counts; and I had only 16 hypofractionated (extra-strength) treatments, targeted just to the tumor cavity. But anemia and other bone marrow disorders are more likely with the 33-treatment whole-breast protocol, and likelier still if one also had chemo.",

I have sleeve & gauntlet sets, but I wear them only when at risk for a flare: flights of 2+ hours, sudden ascents to high altitude (like an express elevator to the top of a skyscraper), long sessions of playing guitar, being in the mountains, repetitive exercise & tasks (lots of cheese-grating, scrubbing, hard-ice-cream-scooping, chopping, raking), being out in very hot weather, berry picking (darn thorns), etc. But I don't wear compression as a matter of course--just for stuff, as my therapist said, that increases the circulation of blood or lymph to the affected arm. No harm in wearing compression when I don't need it, but why go through the inconvenience (and run the risk of getting a snag or the sleeve wearing out)?

It\u2019s the most convenient, of course, to have one-stop-shopping for your cancer care (e.g., a hospital where your entire care team practices), but plenty of patients here have different members of their teams at different hospitals. I noted on another thread that you are considering a Part D plan. If you already have a Medicare Advantage plan (aka Part C), that already includes your prescription coverage. If you do purchase a Part D plan, you would lose your Advantage plan and have to either buy a Part B supplement or have just \u201coriginal Medicare,\u201d which has higher deductibles and co-pays. I went with separate Part B \u201cprivate fee-for-service\u201d and D supplements because I didn\u2019t want to be restricted by an HMO or even PPO. Unfortunately, more and more insurers are dropping their \u201cprivate fee-for-service\u201d plans in favor of HMOs & PPOs. Since you\u2019re already on Medicare, by now you must have been mailed the annual Federal Medicare Handbook. If not, they\u2019re available at your local Social Security office (even if you\u2019re not yet collecting Social Security) or online as .PDFs.

      "Content": "Jul 31, 2017 07:40PM - edited Jul 31, 2017 07:44PM by ChiSandy The most significantly encouraging factor in your Nottingham Score (which determines grade 1, 2, or 3) is that your cells tested \u201c1\" for mitosis\u2014which means they are slow-growing. You don't know your stage yet, because that depends on the tumor's actual size (which can't be determined until it's removed) and degree of nodal involvement (which you don't know till your nodes are biopsied). Sentinel node biopsy is the standard: a dye and/or radioactive tracer are injected shortly before surgery, and the first node(s) between your tumor and your armpit that stain blue or \u201clight up\" with the tracer are removed and biopsied to determine if they contain tumor cells. Your stage and tumor biology will determine whether: you will likely not need chemo (the risks would outweigh a small if any benefit); you will likely need chemo (and despite the \u201cgood factors\u201d of a high ER percentage and negative HER2, a low percentage of PR staining indicates a slightly more aggressive tumor than one with a high percentage of staining of progesterone receptors); or you fall into a \u201cgray area,\" either because of a tumor >1cm, weak hormone-receptor staining, grade 2 or 3, and 1-3 positive nodes. It is that \u201cgray area\" for which the Oncotype DX test is ordered\u2014a score of 17 or less indicates that chemo's benefits would be too small\u2014when added to hormone (endocrine) therapy\u2014to be worth the risk. You might want to ask your surgeon if you have large enough tissue samples to do an OncotypeDX now (based on your tumor being only weakly PR+). OncotypeDX is an example of \u201cgenomic\" testing, which tests the genes of the tumor, not those of the patient. Because of my tumor\u2019s size (1.3 cm) and grade 2, I was in that \u201cgray area\u201d so my tumor was Oncotype-tested. It scored a 16, so chemo was not recommended (especially at age 64). Genetic testing? What's your family history of breast, reproductive, stomach, colon, pancreatic and melanoma cancers? (What \u201cdegree\" of relative\u2014first or second is concerning). And what's your ethnicity? I have no family history of those cancers on either side, so I didn't think it important to mention my Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (both sides) to my surgeon. In the interim between my lumpectomy and seeing my MO for the first time, I read in Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book that regardless of family history, if an Ashkenazi Jewish patient (or a patient of other ethnicities with low rates of intermarriage in which certain mutations are more common) has a breast cancer diagnosis, genetic testing is recommended, maybe even imperative. I told my MO, so she immediately ordered genetic counseling\u2014a prerequisite by insurers before testing. I tested negative for the known mutations, so none of my first or second-degree relatives needed to be tested. Because your tumors are multifocal (more than one) and there is also DCIS present, your surgeon's recommendation of a unilateral mastectomy with or without reconstruction is a sound one. But whether to get a bilateral mastectomy (BMX) is strictly up to you. If you do test positive for mutations in your BRCA-1 or 2, PALB-2 or Chek-2 genes, then a BMX is the prudent way to go because you would be at greater risk of contralateral (other breast) bc. And it's usually (but not always) easier to achieve symmetry when both breasts are reconstructed rather than just one (and augmenting the \u201cnormal\" smaller one to match). But MX is forever, so think long and hard about removing a healthy breast that is not dense and not at genetic risk. Yes, most women who choose MX can avoid radiation\u2014but usually not if cancer is found in the nodes or close to the chest wall. No breasts=no more mammograms, and some women find followup mammos very stressful. So if \u201cpeace of mind\" is a motivating factor, be aware that though the odds of achieving it via BMX, it's never guaranteed.",

The next morning my gyne (who'd been out of the country) called to tell me it was HER2-. But stage depends on both the size of the tumor and the lymph node status, neither of which can be determined until the tumor has been removed and the sentinel nodes removed and biopsied. A surgeon can guesstimate, as mine did, what stage the cancer will probably be but only surgery can confirm it. There seems to be some confusion here about genetic vs. genomic testing. They are two different things, done independently of each other, on different things (blood vs. tumor cells) to find out two different phenomena. Genomic testing (OncotypeDX, MammaPrint, Prosigna) is done on the tumor tissue itself, to determine how vulnerable its cells would be to chemo and therefore if chemo's benefits would outweigh its risk. Sometimes enough tissue is collected in a core biopsy, but usually not. (And one of the eligibility criteria for genomic testing is not just hormone and HER2 receptor status but also node involvement: it is performed only if 0-3 nodes test positive for cancer). It isn't always done, either\u2014the tumor's characteristics and lymph node status may be ineligible, or all features of the tumor (and sometimes the age of the patient) clearly indicate that either chemo would be of no benefit or not beneficial enough to outweigh its risks. But Dodes mentioned that she \u201cgave blood for the genetic testing.\" That is a test that has nothing to do with the actual tumor (nor adjuvant treatment): it determines whether the patient carries genetic mutations that can affect her risk for developing breast cancer (and what type, such as triple-negative), ovarian cancer, and even in some cases colon, pancreatic, stomach, melanoma (and if the patient is male or a first-degree relative who's been tested, prostate) cancer. Based on which mutations are found, prophylactic mastectomy and/or ovario-hysterectomy might be recommended (as well as testing living first-degree relatives). The fact that she was tested indicates that she might have a family history and/or ethnic heritage that would increase the likelihood of various mutations.",

Make large batches of healthy stuff (chili, soups, stews, etc.) and freeze individual portions. Canned proteins--salmon, wild line-caught tuna, sardines, cooked chicken--will come in handy and are ready-to-eat without cooking (and unlike a lot of shelf-stable nukable mixes, not processed. The exceptions are Indian meals in pouches, which are generally all-natural and not necessarily spicy). Hummus, baba ghannouj (if you can easily find it), tabbouli salad, etc. are all healthy and need minimal-to-no prep. Frozen fruits & veggies are easy to prepare and you needn't have to shop several times a week and worry about using them up before they spoil. Bagged and pre-washed salads are good too. If sugar isn't an issue, individual servings of flavored yogurt, rice/chocolate/tapioca pudding, flan, etc. are helpful. If you are within the delivery area for Peapod or Instacart, shopping becomes so much easier. If you have a DVR, time to stockpile episodes of shows you'd like to watch; if a Netflix or Amazon account, time to pick the shows in your queue. You may get fatigue that gets too much for you to think straight as to which shows to watch, and it\u2019s nice to have them lined up. And don't be afraid to open up to your church--that's what they're there for. Wouldn't you jump at the chance to help a fellow congregant in a similar situation? There's also cleaningforareason.org, as well as takethemameal.org--the latter allows friends to pick a night to have a meal they choose (based on your registered preferences) delivered fully-prepared to your door for you & your family.

It is an easier procedure, requiring only a local anesthetic and no surgical admission--the whole shebang from hopping on the table to getting off is under half an hour, tops. The reason to do it that way is to find out whether it's even malignant--if benign you might need nothing further beyond periodic mammograms. If your surgeon insists on going straight from imaging to excisional biopsy, it suggests to me that perhaps he'd rather do it himself rather than entrust it to a breast radiologist (or perhaps the facility where you're being treated doesn't have a breast radiologist). I don't see the point of doing an excisional biopsy, taking a frozen section, and then either closing up or doing a full lumpectomy depending on the results. My surgeon doesn't think while-you-wait frozen sections (which it sounds like what your surgeon wants to do) are any more accurate than core needle samples (maybe less accurate), and you'd be under general anesthesia longer while they wait for the pathology results. It's safer and surer to remove the entire tumor and an adequate margin of apparently non-cancerous tissue, and then wait the 3-5 working days for a full pathological study (including hormonal profile, tumor grade, status of nodes & margins, etc.). Doing the core needle biopsy first is safer for the patient and gives more time to decide on what kind of treatment you want. If you do opt to schedule surgery, you will not only have more time to get ready but when you do have your surgery the surgeon can also do a sentinel node biopsy to avoid unnecessarily dissecting your underarm should your sentinel nodes be negative.  I\u2019ve read of cases in which the core needle biopsy yielded inconclusive results--or came up benign when all factors on the imaging pointed to probable malignancy, or maybe missed the mark because of inadequate guidance provided by the imaging (e.g., mammogram, ultrasound or MRI performed DURING the biopsy to indicate where to place the needle). But that happens maybe 8% of the time, and usually due to inaccurate imaging. Sounds like your surgeon trusts himself more than he trusts the radiologist--which might, rather than being grounded in genuine and justified concern over the radiologist\u2019s competence, be a sign of a turf war. Or the surgeon doesn\u2019t want another doctor in the picture but is not himself skilled in core-needle biopsy (or the core-needle biopsy means a lower reimbursement for him than would an excisional biopsy whether or not followed by lumpectomy). Either first get an image-guided core-needle biopsy by a qualified and experienced breast radiologist, or get a second opinion!",

The swelling from the shot was down enough that I could resume playing two days afterward. It recurred painfully with a vengeance in 2010, and this time the shot was a temporary fix until my touring schedule had a long enough hole in it for surgery & recovery. But all that was pre-bc, and I had and have never had arthritis in my hands. I have been on letrozole four months now and developed mild right arm LE after losing four nodes via SNB. Yesterday I awoke with painless triggering in my right thumb--my picking hand. Like it was on the left, it's in the knuckle joint. To my relief, I was able to pick up a guitar and found that when I play, I move only the joint at the base of the thumb, which is not the joint that \"triggers\" (though I learned enough anatomy the last time out to know that's where the tendon nodule that hangs up on the sheath and causes distal triggering is located). If I play for a minute or two, the triggering mostly abates. So I have no plans yet to get a shot or surgery. But back when I posed the hypothetical to my LE therapist, she said that for all surgeries in the LE arm, the therapist is usually in the OR to do immediate wrapping. She also said that with the shot, not only infection control but wearing compression till the swelling goes down and the infection danger has passed is key. I'm hoping that I can get by for awhile without treating the triggering (aka tenosynovitis). But if it gets worse, I hope I have a long enough window between gigs to recover, especially since after surgery I am not allowed to play till the sutures are out. Just when I thought I'd dodged all the bullets of successfully treating this early Luminal A tumor, now I am threatened with possible loss of my performing career....or quitting AIs and risking metastasis. Gee thanks, cancer.",

Then the tech came in and said the radiologist wanted to do an ultrasound. When she (the radiologist) told me to look at the monitor, I knew it wasn\u2019t a good sign. She demonstrated that the little Jelly-Belly-sized and shaped blob wouldn\u2019t compress when squashed with the probe, so I knew it couldn\u2019t be a cyst. She termed it BIRADS 4 and recommended a core-needle biopsy, which I had a couple of weeks later, and I got my diagnosis the next night. Several (reassuring) caveats: first, a spot compression diagnostic mammo might reveal a false alarm. If not, the ultrasound might possibly rule out anything suspicious for malignancy. Finally, even if a biopsy is necessary, 80% turn out benign.",

Mastectomy is overkill, unless you have actual cancer in the other breast (and elect to have removed) &/or are positive for one of the BRCA or other rarer mutations. Regular screening and tamoxifen make much more sense when there has been no cancer nor genetic risk of it. And remember that even lumpectomy (not the same as an \u201cexcisional biopsy,\u201d which I assume you had) is major surgery, and mastectomy much more so. Major surgery carries very real risks (general anesthesia complications, infection, impaired healing, seromas, etc.) that are more immediate and much more likely than your ADH becoming cancer. Mastectomy would require drain placement and maintenance post-op, sometimes a week or even two; there is pain likely as well.",

But DCIS is considered stage 0 even before surgery, unless and until proven otherwise. As long as it remains within the ducts, it cannot metastasize to the nodes, which is why SNB isn't necessary unless invasive cancer is found. JACTsmom and rosierosie's biopsy reports both indicate DCIS only, so there is no need for them to get SNB at the time of lumpectomy. But iammags, because your biopsy showed both DCIS and IDC, the cancer treatment is driven by the invasive cells--and in this case, IDC can metastasize so you would get SNB. rosierosie, talk to your surgeon and express your concerns. Could be that he won't do the SNB if the lumpectomy reveals only DCIS, but is trying to get your consent to SNB at the same time if it appears while you\u2019re still in surgery that the tumor actually contains some invasive (IDC) cells (or as soon as possible after the surgical path report if IDC is found by the lab). The \u201caxillary node dissection\" is in case the SNB if performed reveals positive nodes with the likelihood that cells may have spread beyond the sentinel (s) to the non-sentinel lymph nodes in the armpit. You may well not be getting all the procedures listed, but he probably wants to let you know you might end up needing them and get your consent should that be the case. But ask, tell him what you want or don't want or why, and take notes--better yet, ask to record your visit. If he gets defensive about that, explain that you are still in shock about being diagnosed and might get confused about or forget some of what he says--it's to help you clearly understand in case you have to go back and listen to it later.",

Not all chemo facilities are set up to do it, so you might have to BYO equipment.

My friend had multifocal DCIS in one breast and some suspicious areas in the other. She had small breasts (A-minus) and hadn\u2019t worn a bra in 30 years, and at 70 declared that her late husband had been the love of her life and she had no desire to date. So she opted for a BMX without reconstruction. Because of that, they didn\u2019t biopsy anything in the other breast before surgery. After the surgery, the other breast was found to have had widespread ADH, so removing it was a good call.",

      "Content": "Jan 15, 2016 03:33AM - edited Jan 15, 2016 03:34AM by ChiSandy People with depression tend to worry more than others (I resemble that remark!). As such, we tend to be more anxious about our health and notice andfollow up on perceived symptoms more than does the general population. We tend to be more conscientious about recommended tests (e.g. mammograms) and take more seriously the advice to seek medical attention if we feel something is amiss. Therefore, I think there is a correlation between depression and breast cancer diagnosis, but not a causational relationship. Plug in the fact that people with depression are often prescribed antidepressants--the most common these days being SSRIs--and it is easy to arrive at the fallacious assumption that women on SSRIs more often get breast cancer, and then to make the logically faulty leap and conclude SSRIs cause it. Actually, it's likelier that the converse is true: the shock and stress of a cancer diagnosis can trigger major depression in those of us already predisposed to depression. In that case, antidepressants can be as lifesaving for breast cancer patients as hormone therapies and anti-osteoporosis drugs: because untreated depression can lead to suicide. Some antidepressants can interfere with the enzyme pathways by which tamoxifen works--but that's not the case with aromatase inhibitors. If you are on tamoxifen, Effexor (or its newer mirror-image molecule desvenlafaxine) is an effective antidepressant that doesn't counteract tamoxifen. BTW, Lyrica and Neurontin (gabapentin) are NOT \"anti-shingles drugs.\" They were originally developed as anti-seizure meds, but doctors found they also block neurogenic (originating from, not just transmitted by the nerves) pain signals, and are effective in treating the pain of shingles, which is a viral nerve inflammation. (They also work on pain resulting from nerves getting cut or growing back together, such as post-surgical pain). They do NOT have any effect on the shingles virus and thus don't treat the disease, just the symptoms. Doctors have also found that tricyclics and trazodone (Desyrel) helped lessen physical pain in patients taking them for depression, and now they are being used to treat some types of pain in non-depressed patients who can't take opioids, NSAIDs or too much acetaminophen. So take your antidepressants as prescribed. Suicide can kill you much faster than can cancer",

(No guarantees in life). The problem with doing an excisional biopsy is that if the path report comes back positive for malignancy, a second operation to check the lymph nodes (sentinel node biopsy or axillary node dissection, if the sentinels are positive) is necessary. What about doing an MRI first, which can pick up stuff (such as ILC or changes in dense breasts that don\u2019t show up on mammo & US)? If anything suspicious shows up, then a core needle biopsy can be done. Always better to start off with the least invasive option, especially if the results show you won\u2019t need surgery (and an excisional biopsy is still surgery--like a lumpectomy but without knowing what the lump actually is and if it\u2019s spread). You also didn\u2019t tell us how old you are, nor whether you\u2019ve ever been pregnant or breastfed. The younger you are, the more likely it is to be fibrocystic disease (benign); pregnancy & breastfeeding can also lead to benign breast changes.",
