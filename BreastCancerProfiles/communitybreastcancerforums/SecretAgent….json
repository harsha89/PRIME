I was your age when all of my boob issues started, too. I'm now 34, so I've officially entered what shall henceforth be known as Year Six of All Things Boob. I'd found a lump about the size of a lima bean (maybe a little bigger) in my left breast in November 2006. I immediately went to my primary care doctor who then sent me to a specialist. They drained the lump and said it was just a cyst, but that it should be removed anyway. Then I saw a breast surgeon who removed the lump during an excisional biopsy (was under general anethesia). The pathology of the lump came back as NOT a cyst, but as an atypical papilloma, which is basically a wart-like growth in the milk duct that had cells that were \"acting funny\" (morphing towards what may have turned into cancer, but not absolutely). As a result, I became labeled as \"high-risk.\" (There's a wonderful High Risk discussion board community on here for that! Definitely check it out!) After I healed from the excisional, I ended up getting my first mammogram in February 2007. During that very first mammogram, the radiologist found several suspicious calcifications and labeled them a BIRAD 5 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BI-RAD). Talk about terrified! So a couple days later I was sent for a stereotactic biopsy. The results came back benign. I continued to have mammograms each year. Which brings us to THIS year's mammogram, which I had in April. It didn't show any significant changes from my 2011 mammogram, but because I'm considered high-risk and am seen at the Hillman Cancer Center here in Pittsburgh, my nurse practioner (who is AMAZING, by the way), said, \"You know, I think I want you to have a breast MRI, just so we know we're not missing anything.\" Fast forward 6 weeks and there I was, in the MRI machine (which you're familiar with). Several days later, the results came back indicating THREE areas of concern, one of which was an actual mass. SO, just two days ago, I had an ultrasound needle biopsy of the areas. Am waiting to hear back about the pathology results. Hope to get them tomorrow, but my gut's telling me it'll be Monday. (Ugh. Waiting is SO DUMB.) My surgeon said she didn't think it looked like cancer on the MRI, but regardless of the biopsy results, I'll need to have that mass removed. Could be just like 2006--another papilloma, and we'll just have to wait to see what THAT pathology report tells us, because sometimes, even if the mass itself is benign, the tissue nearby can be cancerous. So I may find out what I'm dealing with once my biopsy results from Tuesday come back, but I could also have to wait until after the mass is removed (which I have no idea when that will happen). Like I said, WAITING IS SO DUMB. I tell you this because I do understand the fear you're experiencing. I know how much the waiting sucks and plays with your head. BUT, if there's any way you can focus on the following things, it just might help: 1. Your doctors seemed to take your concern and finding VERY seriously. This is good news. It means they're proactive and care about YOU and your health. 2. So many young women have dense breast tissue and cysts and other benign business goin' on in their boobs. There are many different benign things that your lump could be. 3. The community here on breastcancer.org is INCREDIBLE. This place has been a major source of peace and community and healing for me and so many women (and men!). I hope you'll visit here often. 4. Don't Google stuff. There's a lot--A LOT--of incorrect info out there on the web. Stick to this place--not just the discussion boards, but the website as a whole. 5. You are not alone. Ever.Â  PLEASE keep us posted here, okay? Sending you the biggest hugs and tender head pats imaginable. xoxo, Laura",

I'm not sure if I can be a part of your surgery group, since I don't have a cancer diagnosis, but if I can, I'd be very appreciative. I had an atypical papilloma in 2006 at the age of 28, and my medical team said that it was a very, very rare diagnosis for someone my age. As a result, I've been under close watch since then. I've had mammograms and other biopsies for other wonky boob stuff (stereotactic, excisional, and needle). My first breast MRI in June revealed three suspsicious areas in the same breast that my atypical papilloma was in: a mass and two smaller areas. The mass is the intraductal papilloma, and the two smaller areas are ADH. My surgery in August will be for removal of the intraductal papilloma and surrounding tissue and then tested for DCIS and/or atypia. I'm not scared, really, but the waiting *is* rather annoying and hard. Would love to have some other ladies (and 'gents, if there are any!) to wait with, for the solidarity and support.Â  Also, I give REALLY good virtural hugs and love to provide a listening ear. Thinking of each of you as you prepare for next month! Thank you! xo, Laura",

I'm sending you love and good vibes this very moment!! xoxoxo I had a stereotactic biopsy done on my left breast in '07 just a few days after my 29th birthday. I'd had an atypical papilloma in that same breast in '06, which was the beginning of all the boob stuff for me. I was definitely scared of what they'd find, but I trusted that I was in excellent hands. (I'm in Pittsburgh, and our medical community here is INCREDIBLE. I'm very blessed.) For me, the hardest part of the stereotactic biopsy was the fact that you have to lay on your stomach for up to an hour and can't move AT ALL. The table I was on didn't have an indentation for your head, so I had to turn my head and keep it that way for the whole procedure--and not move at all. When the biopsy was over, I remember feeling like my neck was absolutely, completely, 100% broken. It was awful! My breast was the least of my pains at that point! (I think the stereotactic biopsy table was clearly designed by a man. Sheesh!) Sure, the numbing of the breast was a little uncomfortable, but the procedure itself wasn't really bad at all. I felt mostly pressure and some tugging, but no pain, really. And I remember when I finally rolled over onto my back, my breast was as flat as a pancake from being squeezed in the machine for nearly an hour! I looked like I hadn't hit puberty yet! I did have some intense bleeding, which sent me back to the hopsital the next day, but all-in-all, it was okay. And the results back then were benign. I'm rootin' for you, lovely! Keep us posted on how it goes! Also, I'm currently waiting to hear back about an ultrasound needle biopsy I had on Tuesday for several MORE suspicious stuff they found in my same \"busy\" boob. Sounds like it's a big week for both of us! big hugs, Laura",

I have a history of an atypical papilloma, cysts, dense breast tissue, suspicious calcifications, a stereotactic biopsy, an excisional surgical biopsy, two ultrasound needle biopsies, and, coming up soon, another excisional surgical biopsy. The reason for that one is that the suspicious area found on the MRI turned out to be an intraductal papilloma. These are wart-like masses that grow in your milk ducts. Sometimes they're totally benign (non-cancer), and sometimes they have hidden cancer. My medical team wants to remove it because there could be hidden cancer (invasive or in situ) in the papilloma or in the tissue surrounding it. Perhaps what they've found are papillomas.Â  Or they could be cysts.Â  Or they could be fibroadenomas. Of course, the only way to know is to have the masses either biopsied in part (such as through a stereotactic biopsy or a needle biopsy) or removed completely, so that it can be analyzed by the labs.Â  I know it's scary, the not knowing. Definitely talk to a breast specialist/surgeon. I'll be thinking about you! Keep us posted! hugs, Laura",

Yuck!Â Â But know that this is a place you can always come to for amazing support and an incredible plethora of knowledge and experience. And there are lots of other young women on here (early 30s) who have had similar experiences. Like me!Â  I just went through my second stereotactic biopsy on Wednesday the 22nd for suspicious calcifications. (I'll private message you my whole story.) My pathology came back \"epithelial hyperplasia.\" That basically means I have a little overgrowth of cells in that area, but nothing cancerous and nothing atypical. I'm still sore, of course, and admiring my very \"colorful\" bruise. Ha! I also had (on the same day as my stereotactic biopsy) a needle biopsy that came back positive for two papillomas. These two papillomas actually are my third and fourth total since 2006, and I'll be having surgery in the next several weeks to have them removed.Â  As for the stereotactic biopsy: have you ever had one? Here's a GREAT blog post that a fellow bc.org poster wrote about her experience. http://www.hereandthere123.blogspot.com/2008/09/actual-stereotactic-breast-biopsy.html I think most women here who have had a stereotactic will agree: they're not fun. I've had two, and both have been difficult. My advice: 1. DEFINITELY ask for an Ativan to help calm you and relax you. And as for the anesthesia, don't be afraid to tell them you want a lot. And if at any time during the stereotactic biopsy you feel so much as a tiny pinch, you tell them that you want more anesthesia because you're feeling what they're doing. You keep telling them and telling them. Don't remain quiet about it. There is NO reason in this day and age that any woman should have to feel pain while undergoing these procedures. 2. Take the day of the procedure off from work if you can, AND the next day or two if at all possible. Rest, rest, rest. Have a support person to help you that first day AND to go with you to the procedure. I don't know if my body type (very tall and thin with small breasts) makes stereotactic biopsies especially painful, but I took two days off after mine, and it made all the difference. 3. Sports bra. Trust me.Â  Like I said, I'm going to private message you my story. If you want to talk more about your upcoming biopsy, I'm definitely available to listen. xoxo xo, Laura",

The results came back benign, but they determined that the mass was an intraductal papilloma and that it should be removed. I'm meeting with a surgeon next week. Due to the fact that you have DCIS, I would definitely get a second opinion. If your gut is telling you that it seems odd that they don't want to do a biopsy, follow your gut.Â  Will be thinking of you! Let us know what happens, okay? hug, Laura",

Have had 4 intraductal papillomas removed (three different surgeries) since 2006, with one of the papillomas being atypical. Take a read through my posts. Definitely DM me if you have specific questions. Would love to be able to help you out in any way I can. Hang in there. I know how scary it is and how lost you feel...particularly because there's really not a lot of talk about papillomas when we women talk about our breasts. Love and light, Laura",

      "Content": "Jul 2, 2013 04:22PM SecretAgentL wrote: Hi, rhonva! I like to say that I'm the Queen of All Things Papilloma. ;-) So I'll be happy to answer your questions. First, I'm sorry you're going through this! Have you had your surgical consult yet? Just yesterday, I had my third and fourth papillomas removed from my left breast. I'm 35 years old. My very first papilloma in 2006 had atypical cells. As a result, I've been watched like a hawk ever since. And thank goodness, too, because I've had three other papillomas show up. As for your questions: 1. The surgery is done under either a \"twilight\" anesthesia or general anesthesia. It depends on your surgeon, your body, and your anesthesiologist. For all three of my surgeries, I was out like a light. Didn't feel or remember a thing. Easy peasy. Do be aware, though, that women tend to have a unique reaction to anesthesia in that they often are very weepy when they \"wake up\" from it. Don't be alarmed if you find yourself crying when you wake up. Our hormones react uniquely to the medicine in a way that men's don't. I weep like crazy after surgery! And all I want to do is hold my nurse's hand and have her sit with me for a few minutes. 2. The chances that they'll discover cancer is typically around 5-10%. And if it is cancer, it's typically DCIS, which is stage 0. But most times, papillomas are completely benign. They're like these annoying little wart-like growths that form in the milk ducts. Nobody knows why or how they form, which is frustrating. Doctors like to remove them not only because they can sometimes hide early stage cancer but also because they can cause nipple indentation (mine did) and nipple bleeding (mine did). 3. Recovery is really not bad at all. You'll be a bit sore, but a Rx pain reliever really helps. I take Vicodin, and it's very helpful. (Just remember to drink lots of water or drink a bit of prune juice, because Vicodin can cause constipation.) You'll need to wear a good sports bra for about a week, and you'll need to sleep in it for the first few nights. Also, get some frozen peas or corn to use as your \"ice pack\" because it molds really well against the breast and fits snuggly in the sports bra. My icing regimine is 20 minutes every three hours. (I currently have a pack of frozen peas in my sports bra as I type this!) You won't be allowed to lift/push/pull anything greater than about 5lbs. for a specific period of time (your doctor will specify). Just take it easy the first few days. Rest. Catch up on Netflix, magazines, napping, Ben & Jerry's, etc. :) You also won't be able to bathe for 24 hours. 4. As for follow-ups, you'll definitely have a post-op follow-up within 10 days to 2 weeks after. And then your doctor will decide how often you'll need to be screened. Because I have such a history of the little buggers, I'm screened every 6 months. I'm part of a high-risk breast cancer clinic program in Pittsburgh due to my first papilloma having atypical cells (which puts me at roughly a 25-30% higher chance of developing breast cancer in the future). I get a mammogram and MRI once a year, alternating the two every 6 months. I'm very, very fortunate that I have excellent insurance, a medical team that advocates like hell for me, and that I live in one of the best medical cities in the country. Please do keep me updated on your situation. I feel a kindred spirit to other women with papillomas. And if you want to private message me, please feel free! Thinking of you and sending lots of love and light, Laura :)",
