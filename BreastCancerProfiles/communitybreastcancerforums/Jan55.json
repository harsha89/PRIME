    "Content": "Jan55 wrote: I am a newbie here on this forum and I was just diagnosed this week with Stage 1 Breast Cancer.  I'm a little nervous about all this and a bit overwhelmed.  In talking to my surgeon she is recommending a lumpectomy followed by radiation.  She said however, since I have lupus - there are some extra side effects for people with lupus and she wants me to talk to the Radiation Oncologist next week to see if radiation is an option for me and if not, she said she would do a mastectomy instead. Has anyone else here have lupus and went through radiation?  Or if anyone has lupus how did it affect your lupus and what kind of treatment did you go through?  I want to make the right decision so I'm not creating another health problem. Thank you for your help. Jan55 (newbie) Surgery 11/5/2012 Lumpectomy: Right; Lymph node removal: Right, Sentinel Log in to post a reply",
