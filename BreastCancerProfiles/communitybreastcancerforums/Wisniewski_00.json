I have had this problem for months now its almost been a year i never went to the doctor because my mother told me it was just a rash and it was normal for females. I am 16 years old and I read up on my symptoms recently alot lately and my symptoms always seem lead to Pagets diease articles I am very concerned because although i think i might have pagets disease other than my nipple having problems i feel fine there has been no other problems with anything else in my body so i dont know if i should be worried all that much. Any thoughts. i can use advice. Log in to post a reply",
