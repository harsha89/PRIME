Despite that, yes, I'm afraid from recurrence. Because I read here recurrence stories of patients who were diagnosis similar to me. And I know some patients who are worse off than me, (such as stage 3, or grade3 etc.) have no relapse or recurrence for nearly 20 years. I think that the likelihood of recurrence is predicted by statistics, but everyone's individual risk may be more or less. I'm living three or six months episodes and I'm afraid when I feel any pain. I accepted the BC but I couldn't get used to it. I guess I will never get used to it. (sorry for my grammar mistakes, Ä±m not native)",
