Instead of being numb like most people, I am hyper-sensitive so its very painful. Have had one fill so far but holding off on more a bit due to pain. Anyone else have this? No cancer in lymph nodes but still had to get chemo which was an unwelcome surprise. Had my first one on 4/5 (TC) and Neulasta shot the next day. Have had bad bone pain in lower back/hips and down legs because of it. Claritin D was rec. but didn't work for me.  My appetite is already starting to go and  my tongue is sore so nothing even sounds good to me at all. Not sure what to eat at this point.",

However, my sister recommended I let others know by posting on a non-profit site called Caring Bridge which I ended up doing.  It's basically a journal where you document what's going on at any given stage in your treatment. It allows guests to log on and write messages to you as well. I am so very grateful I did as I have gotten a tremendous amount of love, support and uplifting from so many family and friends. Plus, I can reserve my cancer talk to this area as much as possible and still keep everyone updated w/out having to constantly repeat myself to many diff. people.",

So day 13, my hubby went w/me to get it shaved off. I went to the Magnolia Salon at Moffitt here in Tampa. The salon owner was so great and we made it a \"fun\" time. She gave me a mohawk and my hubby took pictures of it and then she shaved me all the way down. Put on my wig to go have lunch w/my hubby and then to a meeting a school w/my 11 yr.old son's teachers(I also have a 15 yo daughter). The wig is styled( unlike my own hair) so this is why it feels weird to me I guess. I not a frufru girl and am not used to the \"styled\" look. I only wear my wig out on occasion, mostly wear bandanas and go bald at home. I did go out for the first time w/my bald head a few days after I shaved it. Went to my daughter's H.S. for an art gallery event(she goes to a Magnet school in the Visual Arts Program). I figured it would be ok because the majority of the kids have mohawks, colored hair, shaved designs on their hair, etc... I felt great and nobody even stared because I guess I fit right in- HaHa!!  I'm wondering what you ladies were put on steroids for? I didn't them so don't know what side effect they're for. I kept a chemo \"log\" too for my first treatment so I could plan what to expect the next time around. The Neulasta shot was the worst and I was in such awful pain for 6 days w/it and couldn't sleep because I had pain in both hips and lower back and down my legs. I didn't take any pain pills, just Tylenol which didn't work. The Claritin didn't work for me either. The nurse said she would give me something different besides Neulasta for my next time- but it's a shot that I have to take 3/times vs. the 1 time w/Nuelasta. I don't know what it's called or what the possible SE are but will find this out b4 getting it. My next fill w/my PS is on Wed. and then my 2nd chemo this Thursday. Hope everyone is hanging in there and that your SE have been minimal. HUGS!!",
