I feel that I'm an awkward limbo between results and decisons.  Diagnosed 8 days ago with IDC, 1 cm, Grade II/III, ER/PR+, HER2+.  NO family history of cancer, and I'm 44.  The general surgeon at my regular medical center was ready to do a lumpectomy earlier this week, along with SNLB.  But I opted to visit the cancer center at a big teaching hospital nearby, and that group will ONLY do surgery after having an MRI.  Plus, more importantly, they say it's their \"standard of practice\" to have BRCA results for all women < 45, even though I have no family history of cancer. So I had that test performed today, but results will take 2+ weeks.  Has anyone else needed to seek BRCA results prior to any surgery (without having a family history of breast cancer)?    If I have HER2+ and Grade II/III, and this thing is growing as we speak, why am I waiting 2-3 weeks for surgery when it's 85-90% likely to be a negative BRCA result?    I'm not opposed to seeking BRCA knowledge; I have two daughters and would likely have had the test at some point anyway.  I just hadn't expected it to come into play now and don't understand why it would have become standard in my situation.  I'm anxious about the wait between diagnosis and treatments.  Diana  BRCA2+, unclear margins from 6/11 lumpectomy; A/C + T chemo 8/11-12/11; Herceptin until 10/12; BMX 1/10/12 with immediate recon.

I won't have BRCA results back for another couple of weeks, but we're going forward with the lumpectomy now, regardless of what the BRCA results may end up being.  My husband and I are moving cross-country in mid-July, and there's simply no time to consider doing any other types of surgery, even if eventually that's something I would do (with BRCA results in hand, eventually).  I feel really good about this. So, waiting for MRI and then waiting to meet with radiation oncologist, and then on to lumpectomy. Diana ",

A mix of physical and emotional SE.   I too can't believe how hard this hair-losing thing is. I really didn't think it would bother me, or maybe I was just in denial about it. Either way, once hubby did a buzz cut on it yesterday morning (and he wasn't particularly even handed at the task, it's definitely a rough cut!), I lost it. He's trying to reassure me that I have a beautiful and well-shaped head and all I can see is a woman looking really sick. I had to go to the onc's yesterday for a quick check-in and wore a hat, but it was hot and itchy and my scalp is super-sensitive. My physical/emotional/mental reaction to chemo is so different than it was for surgery #1.  With surgery you kind of knew what to expect. You could envision the whole process and understand its outcomes.  This chemo crap is the opposite for me.  Every other week they're putting this strong poison directly into my body, while they're giving me all of these other drugs to counter the effects of the poison, and my body often feels awful from all of it but it's totally unpredictable.   I like the idea of having a count-down until the end of chemo, but since I'm triple-positive I still have a year to go of these meds, and who knows what after that.  Plus I'm supposed to have BMX in the winter too, and I can't even fathom how I'll handle reconstruction.  I'm just yearning for my pre-cancer life right now.

Occasional hours when I didn't feel totally lousy, but those were short-lived and unpredictable. I used all the regular things prescribed for nausea, whose names I've now erased from memory but they're the same ones you've all been mentioning. My port site hurt, I was light-headed, I felt cold sores coming on in my mouth, I slept really poorly, it felt like my ear was clogging like from a sinus infection, I felt asthmatic, I was up 2-3 times every night to pee, I had diarrhea in the mornings and was gassy/bloated at night. None of those things all of the time, but some of those things most of the time. Somehow I was in too much of a fog to be as pro-active as I needed to. I felt *completely* over-medicated with the nausea prescriptoins and when those didn't work, I just got depressed. My mother is convinced that chemo was the wrong choice for me (she's a big fan of the Suzanne Somers book and is down on all \"western\" medicine). PLUS my 3 teenage kids are all (still) out of school and it rained for 3 solid days of the bad time.  AAARRRGGGHHHH.   Then there was this miraculous feeling this past Friday morning when I woke up and felt *totally* normal. As if I'd never had chemo.  It was what I needed to shake me out of the sadness. My doctor was very sorry that it took 8 full days to happen, but said that's what he'd hoped I'd have gotten to by day 3-4.    I already have a different attitude ready for AC round 2 (scheduled for Thursday 8/25).  I'm ready for what it might be like. I've been using salt-water rinses 4-5 times/day and the cold sores are healing and minimal. I realize much my emotional mood made the whole experience worse. I'm scheduling acupuncture appts for this week and next. I'm going to log on here more regularly so I don't feel so isolated through this whole thing!   Diana ",

Here's another study too in which taxotere did well - http://scienceblog.com/community/older/2003/E/20032882.html  The chemo nurses told me that the s/e are often stronger with taxotere, esp weight gain because of water retention, and neuropathy.  And that's just great, because everybody loves a little weight gain.  I can't find the reference, but somewhere on the internet is a study that showed that a tiny % of people had permanent hair loss with taxotere (higher than on taxol).  Psych.   So I begin 4 doses of taxotere in early October, once I finish with one more round of AC.  I believe that I will begin herceptin at the same time, at least I was supposed to do that with the taxol and they haven't said otherwise yet...   ",

MUCH more fatigue than ever before at this point in the game.   Here's wishing calm days and nights for everyone.",

If I had more A/C to go, I'd stop now.  This week has been hell. The worst of the four rounds, both physically and emotionally/mentally.  Though not the same kind of acute physical reactions that you're having.   I won't stop chemo altogether at this point, in part because I believe everyone when they say the Taxotere/Herceptin will have milder side effects.  And Taxotere has such a completely different way of killing cancer (versus both A and C) that I want to at least try it. But we are probably going to postpone starting it by a week, so I can have a longer respite between these.  ",
