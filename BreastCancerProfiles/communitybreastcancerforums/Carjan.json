    "Content": "Oct 10, 2009 02:32PM - edited Oct 10, 2009 02:34PM by Carjan Hi KT05, I too had a score of 18 and my doc also gave me a \"choice\" of rads or join a study group where the chance was 50/50 I'd get chemo.  I chose the rads only because 1) doc told me I'd only get a 1% benefit from chemo and 2)  if my doc was willing to enrol me in a study that would potentially drop me in the 50% group that do NOT get chemo then the benefit was indeed negligible. + if I have a recurrence; at that point I'd have no choice but to have chemo. I'm 41 so I figured I got one chance to say no to chemo and I took it.  I finished 7 weeks of rads in July and am due for my 1st post lumpectomy mammo 10/21. Have been on Tamoxifen since August w/ no issues. Hope this helps you in your decision and good luck.",
