Restoril or Trazadone are excellent for sleep. I know all of us are sick of going to doctors but I think a psychistrist or a psychiatric nurse practitioner know these type of meds best. Good Luck, Amy",

Well, while I was recovering from port placement yesterday, my surgeon told my husband that because I am getting radiation down the road, immediate reconstruction is not a possibility and will probably be at least a year post surgery. So then I had  to start thinking about prosthesis....... Now, drumroll please, I am about 95 % sure I  am going to wear camisoles under shirts. I wear them under shirts now to hold my stomach in so it won't be a big change. Thank you ladies for opening my eyes to this possibility! Amy",
