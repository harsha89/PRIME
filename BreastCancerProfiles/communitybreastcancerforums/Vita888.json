So many posts have touched me, but I felt compelled to make my very first post after reading your story. Dale, I am truly touched by the story you shared about you, your wife, and your soon-to-be born baby. I'm thankful your wife has you as her life partner, and I'm grateful that you have relatives nearby to support you on this journey as well. I look forward to the day when you post about the joy, excitement, and elation over the birth of your baby. I'm also looking forward to reading the update when your wife kicks that cancer's behind. Stay strong. Peace and blessings to you and your family.",
