So sad to scroll down and see you have cancer. I too am playing the waiting game. Had my mammo/ultrasound on Thursday....took a REALLY long time (nealry 2 hrs), and when I finally saw the radiologist, she suggested they biopsy immediately. The other radiologist who did the biopsy stayed late, and both the nurse and the ultrasonographer stayed overtime. So even though they were joking about not having anything better to do, and downplayed it, there was a palpable sense of urgency.  I have 6 masses, they biopsied three. No idea about lymph node involvement, but they seemed to suspect it. Said that ordinarily 6 lumps is a good sign, but that the calcifications surround the masses are suspicious of cancer. And she also began preparing me for the idea of a mastectomy....which I don't think she would have done if she were fairly certain it's cancer. Red wine has been helping with the anxiety....and there are antioxidants in there, which is cancer fighting right? Ha! Hang in there, girl. Sending you lots of positive energy and hoping for the best for you. Will you update us on how things are going? ",

I have worked in hospitals and I think it is true that people too often lack thoroughness when reading reports and communicating with patients. The best advice I have gotten so far (from my 36-year old friend, a survivor) is \"question everything, and don't believe anything without evidence to back it up\". Doc's like to speculate, but it's worthless information if there is no evidence to support it.  Will you please keep me updated on your status?",

It feels round, is approx. the size of a marble/grape, and is painless. I went in to see the first available doc. in my Internist's practice. She felt the lump, and possibly others, in that breast. I have an appt. for a mammo/ultrasound this week.  I have also had VERY irregular menstrual cycles in the last few months. In the month of April, I had 3 full periods lasting 5-7 days each. I took a pregnancy test at the time, and it was negative. I also have an appt. with a new OB to get this checked out. I understand this is a symptom of uterine cancer.   So far, the only results I have are those for a CBC, a metabolic screen, and a urinalysis. The only abnormal result was for my white blood cells - they are elevated. I was fighting a cold at the time of the blood draw though. Thyroid is fine. No anemia.   Oh, and there is a lesion on my leg that they want to have biopsied....you know, becasue two possible forms of cancer isn't enough. Might as well add a third!  So my question is this: Has anyone else had irregular bleeding associated with a lump? Or an elevated WBC count? Also curious about what other women's lumps feel like?

      "Content": "May 12, 2012 11:58AM - edited May 12, 2012 12:10PM by ElleBee Ok ladies. I have an update for you. It's a doozy, so here goes'...  Had an OB/GYN appt Wednesday. He felt my lump, and said that he though he felt 4-5 distinct lumps. Talked about cysts and fibroadenomas. we also discussed my irregular bleeding and he ordered an internal ultrasound, one where they inject the uterus with saline to inflate it and get a good image. That happens Monday, so more on that later. He also ordered labs to check for prolactin and dhea-s. Prolactin was fine, but the dhea-s is elevated (value over 400). No word yet on the significance of this other than it is a sign that my adrenal glands are producing too much hormone. It could be a sign of many things...like PCOS, adrenal tumors, adrenal cancer or adrenal hyperplasia. Further labs are probably warranted. This could explain my irregular bleeding though. Then on Thursday, I had my mammo/ultrasound. They took over 20 pics of the breast in question. It showed calcifications. Also, they did the ultrasound and found 6 masses (SIX!!!), none of which are cysts. They scanned my armpit, and the radiologist and ultrasonographer whispered and consulted, but said nothing in particular about my lymph nodes. The radiologist told me this...that ordinarily 6 lumps is a good thing. That lumps in large numbers are more likely to be benign. However, the arrangement of the calcifications surrounding the masses are suspicious of cancer. I became tearful, and she went on to say that her colleague who does biopsies was willing to do it right away. At this point it was 3:40 (appt. was at 1:00). They said they had to get an order to do the biopsy, and asked for contact info for all the doctors I see. Within 10 minutes they obtained an order from someone, and the new Radiologist came in and did the biopsies. I came to discover that the nurse should have left at 4, and the Radiologist and ultrasonographer should have left at 5...all stayed late. So there was an obvious sense of urgency that they tried to downplay. I also learned that biopsies never happen after 2 at this location, and that this was an exception. Sheesh! If I weren't worried enough, I sure am now! She needle-biopsied 3 of the 6 masses, and marked each with a titanium marker. She sent the samples to pathology, but given that all this happened LATE Thursday, she said results won't be likely until Tuesday. So, I wait. And wait. And fret, and wait.  So I am really becomming concerned that I have cancer everywhere.  Trying to stay as positive as possible. Anyone know if elevated dhea-s is associated with breast cancer? Or if you had hormone changes in your labs when diagnosed?",

I don't want to feel very sick, so I am going to talk with my onco about being as proactive as possible with side effects.   I work 2 part-time jobs, around my husband's schedule, and my income is important. They are the kind of jobs that if I don't show up, I don't get paid. I am REALLY worried about money and chemo interfering with my ability to work. Seeing how many of you had tolerable side effects helps me feel hopeful. Did any of you work through chemo? I teach college, and I also bartend in a very busy fun bar (the latter provides GREAT income and is pretty much my social life) so I am on my feet a lot. But the longest I am on my feet is 7-8 hrs.

I will be starting chemo soon, before surgery, to hopefully shrink my 6 tumors and give the surgeon good margins.  So seasoned veterans of chemotherapy, have at it! Tell me, and others reading this, what to expect. How fast will our hair fall out? How often did you have treatment? What were your side effects like? Did you have a port? Did you wear a wig? What were the most challenging aspects of this process? What was unexpected? In what ways were you pleasantly surprised? What should we expect afterward? How long did it take before you could actually style your hair? It's about time we shook the dust off this forum. The most recent posts were from YEARS ago. Let's all help ladies out there who are just beginning chemo.  Thanks, ElleBee  Treatments are every Monday Dx 5/14/2012, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIB, Grade 2, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Dx 5/14/2012, DCIS, 3cm, Stage IIB, Grade 2, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Targeted Therapy 6/3/2012 Herceptin (trastuzumab) Surgery 12/4/2012 Mastectomy: Left, Right; Reconstruction (left): DIEP flap, Free TRAM flap; Reconstruction (right): DIEP flap, Free TRAM flap Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "ElleBee wrote: I am a 37 year old wife and mother of 2 wonderful kids, ages 8 and 3. Last Tuesday, completely by accident, I found a lump in my right breast. The following morning I went to the first available doc. in the practice I go to, who is a Nurse Practitioner. Her resident did my assessment, and felt my lump. She thought she could feel a second lump, which I was able to feel later. I also told them that I have been experiencing irregular bleeding the last few months (I had THREE periods in April, and irregular cycles for a few months). And there is a weird spot on my leg. So they referred me for a mammo/ultrasound, another referral to an OB/Gyn to figure out what is up with the bleeding, and a dermatologist for the \"lesion\" on my leg. They did labs to check my thyroid and other things. Everything appeared normal except for an elevated white blood cell count.  A week passes, and I had the OB/GYN appt this past Wednesday. He felt my lump, and said that he thought he felt 4-5 distinct lumps. Talked about cysts and fibroadenomas. we also discussed my irregular bleeding and he ordered an internal ultrasound, one where they inject the uterus with saline to inflate it and get a good image. That happens Monday, so more on that later. He also ordered labs to check for prolactin and dhea-s. He was trying to see if I have a hormonal imbalance, and it seems that I do. Prolactin was fine, but the dhea-s is elevated (value over 400). No word yet on the significance of this other than it is a sign that my adrenal glands are producing too much hormone. It could be a sign of many things...like PCOS, adrenal tumors, adrenal cancer or adrenal hyperplasia. Further labs are probably warranted. This could explain my irregular bleeding though. Then on Thursday, I had my mammo/ultrasound. They took over 20 pics of the breast in question. It showed calcifications. Also, they did the ultrasound and found 6 masses (SIX!!!), none of which are cysts. They scanned my armpit, and the radiologist and ultrasonographer whispered and consulted, but said nothing in particular about my lymph nodes. The radiologist told me this...that ordinarily 6 lumps is a good thing. That lumps in large numbers are more likely to be benign. However, the arrangement of the calcifications surrounding the masses are suspicious of cancer. I became tearful, and she went on to say that her colleague who does biopsies was willing to do a needle biopsy right away. At this point it was 3:40 (appt. was at 1:00). They said they had to get an order to do the biopsy by 4:00, and asked for contact info for all the doctors I see. Within 10 minutes they obtained an order from someone, and the new Radiologist came in and did the biopsies. I came to discover that the nurse should have left at 4, and the Radiologist and ultrasonographer should have left at 5...all stayed late. So there was an obvious sense of urgency that they tried to downplay. I also learned that biopsies never happen after 2 at this location, and that this was an exception. Sheesh! If I weren't worried enough, I sure am now! She needle-biopsied 3 of the 6 masses, and marked each with a titanium marker. She sent the samples to pathology, but given that all this happened LATE Thursday, she said results won't be likely until Tuesday. So, I wait. And wait. And fret, and wait. So I am really becomming concerned that I have cancer everywhere given the adrenal gland malfunctioning, the uterine bleeding, the possible melanoma on my leg, and the breast masses. Trying to stay as positive as possible. I am only 37....well, technically still 36. I am too young for this to be happening. My mind is going everywhere. My husband is terribly worried and worn out. I just want to know, so I can begin coping with it. It's like being in limbo....a holding pattern....and it SUCKS. Thanks goodness for my kids, they are a wonderful distraction.  Treatments are every Monday Dx 5/14/2012, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIB, Grade 2, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Dx 5/14/2012, DCIS, 3cm, Stage IIB, Grade 2, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Targeted Therapy 6/3/2012 Herceptin (trastuzumab) Surgery 12/4/2012 Mastectomy: Left, Right; Reconstruction (left): DIEP flap, Free TRAM flap; Reconstruction (right): DIEP flap, Free TRAM flap Log in to post a reply",

I too am not expecting a good result, and as the days have ticked by since Thursday, I am starting to feel some acceptance too. Just spoke to the nurse, and she said my labs are still \"pending\". She said to call in a couple days. Ummm, I will be calling her back tomorrow. This time, I am allowing myself to be a 'squeaky wheel'. What day did you get your biopsy done Pam? ",

They are so precious. Truly, my greatest accomplishment. Going to brunch at my brother-in-laws, then working tonight. Going to stay as busy as possible....but I will be calling for the results first thing in the morning.  Admittedly, I have been googling. But it sort of helps. At this point, having information is the only power I have. It's comforting in an odd way. Velo: Aren't we too young for this? Isn't that what they say? No routine mammos until age 40? I am just stunned...and also surprised by how many women our age are getting the diagnosis in these forums. I will let you know when I learn more. Thanks again! ",
