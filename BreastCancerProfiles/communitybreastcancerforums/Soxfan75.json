I have 18 sessions down and 10 to go. So far my skin is just a little red/tanned and it feels a little like a sunburn, but it's not a constant discomfort. I've been using the aloe directly from an aloe plant that I have, but I've also been using a cream that my RO recommended called My Girls. It absorbs really well and doesn't feel greasy at all. It's a little pricey at $29.99 but I'd rather pay a little extra than have to use something like Aquafor, which is feels too greasy. I've been using it since about the third session or so, and my skin isn't peeling or blistering and actually still feels really soft. It's hard to determine how I would have fared using something else, but I'm pretty happy with my results so far. Has anyone else heard of this cream? It contains 10% calendula officianalis extract and is made specifically for radiated skin.",

I finished rads today and I'm so grateful to be done so I can let my body start healing. I did really well up until the last week or so when my bright red/tanned skin started peeling under my armpit. It is so painful and rubbing any kind of lotion on it burns. Has anyone had this and did you find anything that gave you some relief?",

The first one went septic and none of the three episodes cleared up with just oral antibiotics. The only thing that knocks it out is IV antibiotics so if my calculations are correct, I've had a midline in my arm for more that six weeks this past year. After the third hospitalization, the infectious disease doctor and my onc decided to put me on suppression therapy (prophylactic oral antibiotics). That's because I'm on a relatively new drug called Nerlynx and it wasn't until I started taking the drug that I began to get the infections. We're not sure if the drug is somehow compromising my ability to fight off the infections, but they want me to continue with the suppression therapy for the duration that I'm on the drug (through May 2019). Within ten days to two weeks before I get cellulitis, I find myself feeling really fatigued and extremely nauseous, both worse than chemo. I'm nervous now because a few days ago, I started feeling fatigued again and the nausea hit me a couple of days ago. I'm praying it's not cellulitis again because I'm petrified that at some point, they're going to make me take the implant out. Being single and only 43, that's not something I want to even think about. Have you had any issues since your last post? ",

I'm hoping for a benign scenario as well but I'm not optimistic, especially since the BS looked at it on ultrasound and said he thought it was metastasized bc. I just finished chemo two weeks ago and I can't for the life of me figure out how it could have survived, or at the very least, didn't shrink. I start rads on August 14th and my RO said that area will be included so he doesn't foresee any reason to not move forward with it. I hope your MRI results confirm that it's benign!",

My BS looked at the lump on an ultrasound and said he saw calcification. When I asked what it could be he said it was very likely metastatic breast cancer. He said it could also be metastatic thyroid cancer or lymphoma. I just finished chemo two weeks ago so I asked if it could be anything benign. He said it's possible that there was cancer in that spot the whole time and when the chemo killed it, the body's reaction is to wrap the dead cancer cells in scar tissue. That was the only benign scenario he gave me. I had a CT scan the same day as the biopsy and my RO could see it, so he went and looked at my CT scan from March, which was after my surgery but before my chemo. He said it was there at that time too. That leads me to believe that it's not dead cancer cells wrapped in scar tissue. The question is why didn't it light up on the MRI that I had done before chemo? If it showed up on the CT scan back then, why didn't they see it on the MRI? Someone told me that if I had a breast MRI done, then it wouldn't have scanned that area. It seems so odd that the lymph nodes by the collar bone wouldn't be included. Any insight is appreciated. I have to wait until Tuesday for the pathology results and it's driving me crazy. I've never been so scared.",
