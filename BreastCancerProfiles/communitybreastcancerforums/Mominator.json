This is such a difficult decision, but it was made by carefully weighing the pros and cons of treatment, and its affect on your quality of life and your family. The people who may feel you are giving up do not understand all that has gone into your decision. They are the ones who see the rosy visions of cancer patients on TV shows, who look and feel rather good, until they quietly say their good-byes and pass away in their sleep. Many best wishes for your cruise. I hope you are feeling better by May and have a wonderful cruise. Also, sending good luck for the house hunting. I really don't think it matters when you move into the house. The important part is that you pick it out as a family. My only suggestion is that you consider palliative pain relief and/or hospice before June 14. You can find out what's available, and pick and choose the services you want, and when you want to start them. I've seen people wait before calling hospice, and they always wished that they had started hospice sooner. My friend Lori really would have benefited from hospice much sooner, but husband was reluctant to \"give up\" as he called it. Her children were 15, 13, 13, 13 (triplets), 12, and 10 when she passed. ",

First, we need to find out what your new lump is: cancer or benign. (most common causes of breast lumps here http://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/benign-breast-lumps#1) Second, if it is cancer, it could be either a new primary or a local/regional recurrence. Breast cancer is only metastatic if it leaves the breast and immediate lymph node system. Holding your hand, Madelyn",

You have been given some information, and now you need to decide what to do. I would suggest learning more, from a genetics counselor, FORCE, PROMPT, NCCN, and other sources. BTW, both BRCA1 & 2 genes are actually tumor suppression genes. We all have these genes. Some of us have mutations on these genes. These mutations cause the genes to work differently. Some mutations have been associated with cancer, some we don't know yet. I have a BRCA2 deleterious mutation and a STK-11 VUS - Variation of Unknown Significance. Cancers associated with the BRCA gene deleterious mutations are: BRCA1: Breast, ovarian, male breast, pancreas, and prostrate. (sorry I don't have the percentages for BRCA1 handy) BRCA2: Breast age 50, up to 28%, age 70, up to 84%; ovarian 27%, male breast 6.8%, pancreas 7%, prostrate 20%, and melanoma elevated risk. Compare these figures with General population: Breast age 50, 1.9%, age 70, 7.3%; ovarian 0.7%, male breast less than 0.1, pancreas 1%, prostrate 8.2%, and melanoma 1.6%. (from Myriad My Risk) Please note that neither BRCA1 nor 2 are associated with uterine cancer. If you want prophylactic surgery, you do not need a full hysterectomy. You do not need to \"have it all\" out. However, you do need to remove both the ovaries and the Fallopian tubes. The Fallopian tubes tissue is similar to the ovaries. In one study, approximately half of the ovarian cancers started in the Fallopian tubes. The surgery is called BSO = Bilateral Salpingo - Oophorectomy. People with BRCA1 and/or 2 mutations have HBOC = Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome Although BRCA 1 and 2 are similar, there are some differences: (from Wikipedia) \"BRCA-related breast cancer appears at an earlier age than sporadic breast cancer. It has been asserted that BRCA-related breast cancer is more aggressive than normal breast cancer, however most studies in specific populations suggest little or no difference in survival rates despite seemingly worse prognostic factors. BRCA-related ovarian and Fallopian tube cancer is more treatable than average because it is unusually susceptible to platinum-based chemotherapy like cisplatin. BRCA1-related ovarian cancer appears at younger ages, but the risk for women with BRCA2 climbs markedly at or shortly after menopause.\" My mother is BRCA2 positive. Her first cancer was DCIS at age 62, her second was ILC stage IIIA at age 79. Both of her cancers were post-menopausal. She was 17 years cancer free between her breast cancer diagnosis, and the cancers were different (duct, lobe) and different breasts (R, L). My Grandmother died of ovarian cancer at age 48, right at menopause. My grandmother was an only child. My aunts seem to be fine, and they have only boys. My sister is BRCA2 negative. Currently, there are three treatments for HBOC: 1. increased surveillance (alternating mammograms and breast MRIs every 6 months), 2. chemo-prevention (taking a medication that suppresses estrogen), and 3. prophylactic mastectomy and Salpingo - Oophorectomy. So Laura25, Suezie23, and natei4143, take some time to research and then decide. Since Laura25 and natei4145 are BRCA1, you may wish to do the prophylactic surgery sooner, since BRCA1 tends to appear about two decades earlier than the general population (around age 50). Suezie23, with BRCA2 you probably want to do the surgery at least before menopause, since that's when BRCA2 tends to appear. In other words, yes, you all have a high risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, but cancer isn't going to get you in the next several months. You all have enough time to research and decide what to do. lintrollerderby: your daughter had the PBMX. Is she having regular screenings for ovarian cancer? Another good source is Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book. She mentions that there are many factors that determine if cancer develops, and we don't know all of them. Genetics, nutrition, and environmental causes are some of them. My best wishes to all of you. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have. Mominator",

It looks like there is still much research to be done, as that 2014 study states:  It could be that 2 of the 4 cancers were caused by tamoxifen, not the BRCA1 mutation. In that case, the other 2 cancers were about at the same rate as the general population. When I was preparing for my prophylactic surgeries, I consulted with Genetics Counselor, my OB/GYN, my Gyn Oncologist and my Breast Surgeon. My OB/GYN and Breast Surgeon both suggested that I \"get everything out\" but the reasoning was \"just because.\" My Genetics Counselor said that uterine cancer is not associated with BRCA mutations / HBOC. My Gyn Oncologist went further: \"I could do a full hysterectomy on you. However, you do not need it. Uterine cancer presents with abnormal bleeding, so it is more easily detected than ovarian cancer.\" Thus, I had BSO, not a full hysterectomy. I do continue to see my OB/GYN for my annual exams and she said that everything looks good. Best wishes to all.",

At 9:00 my temp was 100.2 and the area around the right drain looked swollen to me. I called the PS office and they had me come in. My doctor wasn't available, so I saw another doctor. He thought everything looked good and started talking about \"the 5 w's: wound, water, wonder drug...(can't remember the other w's).\" Since my wound looked fine, he thought it could be a UTI (water) or a delayed reaction to the wonder drug (anesthesia from last week) or maybe I'm just coming down with something. I don't have any UTI symptoms, I had my flu shot in September, and I haven't been near anyone who is sick. He renewed the script on the Keflex and wrote another script for a urine test.

It was all benign, but of course very worrisome during breast-feeding. Best wishes, Mominator",

As we expected, Plastic Surgeon had to do a lot of \"pocket work\" on both breasts. Also, PS removed some fat tissue that was just under the skin on the lower halves of both my breasts. The fat was keeping the skin stiff and slowing down the healing. The fat was \"not exactly necrotic\" but it was \"definitely not happy\" where it was. I don't know how much total he removed, but it was a lot. PS said he removed about 50 grams more from the right breast than the left. So that's why he put a bigger implant on the right side (495 gm) than the left (450 gm) to even them out. PS thinks the breasts look even now, or perhaps the left is possibly slightly bigger. Both breasts are really swollen, but are starting to shape up much better. I am happy with the results. SVGsurvive: I saw my nipples about 3 days post-BMx when the dressings were changed. My nipples were very bruised and purple after BMx. Be prepared for that: it is completely normal. I just saw them today, 3 days post-exchange, when the nurse took off the steri-strips and they looked pretty good. I empty my drains twice a day, and try to milk/strip them at the same time. I find it frustrating because the liquid seems to go back up. I didn't make a big deal of rinsing out the bulb. I used water most of the time. I only used the rubbing alcohol toward the end as the bulbs were getting nasty. A \"scopolamine patch\" is a patch of anti-nausea medication. I think \"doing too much\" is whatever causes yourself pain.",

As I reread your pathology report, there's a lot to digest. Here's what I see. Right breast: DCIS and LCIS; negative margins and >10mm; and no nodes involved. The in situ for both is very encouraging to me, although I am even more concerned about two types of cancers present. What are the implications of multiple types of cancers? Left breast is even more complicated: Stage 1a and DCIS invasive ductal carcinoma, extensive LCIS, and atypical lobular hyperplasia involving preexisting fibroadenoma and adenosis. Again, two types of cancer, plus there is an invasive component. Hyperplasia, fibroadenoma, and adenosis are changes occur in our bodies as we age, but atypical hyperplasia is associated with an increased risk of cancer. So, there was a lot going on in both breasts, not just the two types of cancer, but the atypical hyperplasia suggests that more areas may have been heading towards cancer. Note, these are just my first impressions. I would have many more questions about the pathology report, plus questioning whether you need the Mammorint or Oncotype testing. Have you seen Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book? So, to ammend my earlier suggestion to get a second MO opinion: Please get a second opinion. Before your appt, go over your pathology report very carefully with Dr Love's Breast Book and make a list of questions. Make a copy of the questions and give it to the MO. Get your questions answered and you'll have a better plan.",

The BMX was much harder than the exchange, but my exchange included a lot of pocket work and additional tissue removed. I had some set-backs, including a debridement at 3 weeks from BMX and a major infection at 10 days from exchange. However, I was just thinking this morning, I feel pretty good! I'm getting over the infection. Nothing really hurts, and my range of motion is really improving. I am even shorter at 5' 2\", so I have been stretching more.

Although I think there may be a pocket of fluid at the site of the infection. It feels funny only when I move the right certain ways. At 3.5 weeks from exchange surgery, and 2 weeks from infection, I still can't quite sleep on either side yet. So things are still settling and healing. I didn't do any of the shoveling this winter. I am building up my ROM and the weights of things I carry. Despite my infection and pocket work, the exchange surgery is still an easier recovery then the MX. I hope that is encouraging for those who are doing reconstruction. Grandma3x: I enjoyed the story of your dog and the car. Today is my dog's 4th birthday. His name is S'more.

I had a nipple-sparing BMX, so I won't need nipple recon. @edwsmom: During the nipple sparing mastectomy, the BS will remove tissue right behind the nipple and send it to pathology for testing during surgery. Pathologist will give a report so BS will know whether or not nipple can be spared. The risk associated with leaving nipple behind, presuming it passes above test, is about the same as a Mx. My BS said that she's only had one nipple that could not be spared in all of her NSMx's. Patient had a lump in another part of her breast, and they were surprised that the nipple also tested positive. She also had one patient have a recurrence in the scar tissue of a Mx, non NS. So, anecdotal, the odds of recurrence were similar. Sending good thoughts to our surgery sisters for this week.",

My breasts were very different sizes while pregnant and breastfeeding. My right was about twice the size of the left, very heavy, and always produced so much more milk than the left. You are pregnant, so all those hormones are making big changes in your body. The odds that it happens to be cancer are small. I'm sure you'll want to know right away what's going on, but sometimes it takes a few steps (ultrasound, biopsy, etc.) to get your answers. While you're waiting, I did some quick research for you: A lactating adenoma is a benign tumor which usually occurs in younger, pregnant and lactating women. It is a variant of a class of benign breast lesions called 'fibroadenomas', which is essentially a pronounced growth of ducts and  also the fibrous connective tissue including the glandular components. Lactating adenomas are usually benign but in rare instances they can occur simultaneously with breast cancer. Phyllodes tumors are rare breast tumors that start in the connective (stromal) tissue. They are most common in women in their 30s and 40s, but women of any age can have them. Very rarely, phyllodes tumors can be cancer. So take a few more deep breaths while you wait for your biopsy. We'll hold your hand in the meantime. Keep us posted.

I'm two days post exchange and feeling better each day. I've been spreading out the meds and I find the pain kicks in around 6 hours after the last Percocet. I expect to stay on the Percocet just a few more days, and then switch over to Tylenol. I'm still wearing the scopolamine patch and will keep it for the full 3-days. The anesthesiologist was asking about my nausea yesterday. She thinks I will always have nausea after general anesthesia. Not that I'm planning any more surgeries, but something to remember if there's another surgery. Grandma3x: my PS uses drains for anatomicals, as he feels there's too much risk of rotation if there's any fluid build-up. BlueHeron and Balthus: no judgments on recon either way. Recon is definitely more involved than the PS's tell us. 7of9 and SVGsurvive: glad to see you both making progress. Kessa: removal of my Mx drains didn't hurt. I'm glad yours didn't either. JulieAggie: sorry you didn't get rid of your drains yet. Gemma/Amy: I really have no idea about your possible treatments. Best I can say is listen to your doctors and their recommendations. Ask them the pros and cons of each choice, and what would they recommend for a family member. I remember how scared I was when I was facing neurosurgery. The neurologist said if I was his daughter, he would recommend the surgery with that neurosurgeon.",

After the appointment, I got a copy of the pathology report. I am certainly very happy that the removed tissue was all benign. But I surprised that the tissue was listed as \"breast tissue\" as opposed to just \"fat tissue\" or something else. I had a BMx in November, and this was just an exchange, TEs were taken out and some fat. So it makes me nervous that the pathology is calling it breast tissue and makes me wonder if there's more breast tissue in there. ",

I just occurred to me this morning as some of you are preparing for mastectomies: Consider taking pre-op and post-op photos if you want to record your journey. I've been taking simple photos using the timer setting on my camera. Using the timer allows me to do this myself, privately. I haven't shared these photos with anyone, and I'm not sure that I will. I took two sets of pre-op photos, both before and after the pre-op marking. I took the first post-op photo the morning after I got home from surgery. I took photos fairly often at first (every other day) to mark the progress. I had a debridement procedure along the way, so I made sure to take photos before and after that. And I'll take photos before and after exchange to implants. That first post-op photo was the worst, as my breasts were terribly bruised and swollen. But as time passed, even those first few days, I could see progress. I have made remarkable progress in just over 8 weeks. My reconstructed breasts are healing nicely and are looking better all the time. If you've already had surgery, but didn't take a pre-op photo, don't worry: your Breast Surgeon and/or Plastic Surgeon probably have pre-op photos. Both of my surgeons' nurses had taken photos of me. The PS has several photos including front and side facing. Strength, healing, and love to everyone, Mominator",

      "Content": "Jan 16, 2016 07:49AM Mominator wrote: Hello everyone! Some things I'm noticing here are the same things we went through over the November 2015 surgeries thread: how to manage pain, when to change dressings, what type of bra to wear, when to shower, etc. I am not a medical professional. But I am an experienced patient. I had 5-hour neurosurgery in March to correct a Chiari Malformation, and I had 5-hour PBMx (with TEs) and PBSO in November. I was really scared leading up to the neurosurgery, a bit scared for the BMx. Now I am facing exchange surgery feeling rather calm. Here are some of the things I learned along the way. Whenever you have a doubt about anything, ASK your doctor/physician's assistant/nurse. Antibiotics: many surgeons prescribe them as a precaution. Many others are avoiding overuse of antibiotics. If you see any redness, or if you skin feels hot, or if you're running a fever: call your doctor whether or not you're on antibiotics. Bras, camisoles, and coverings are up to the surgeon. Sometime surgeons will have the bra put on you at the end of surgery. Sometimes it will be given to you during your stay or before you go home. Some leave you to find what's comfortable for you. I had no bra at all for two weeks (just large bandages taped to my breasts) because my breasts were too swollen and bruised. On my two-week visit, the swelling was down enough I could just barely tolerate a bra. Ask the nurse before surgery what the standard procedure is for your surgeon. Bandages: follow the directions of your surgeon. Some surgeons use dermabond, which is a special skin glue. Others use tapes. If your bandages get really gross, call the nurse or PA, or ask to come into the office to have it changed. Drains: are a bother. Almost everybody gets them and everybody hates them. Not having a drain can be even worse. A couple of our November ladies didn't have drains, and needed to have the fluid aspirated. Not fun. You will need to empty the drains, and measure and record the liquid that comes out. They should give you something to measure (they gave me as a urine specimen cup). Drains are removed when the fluid falls under a certain amount for a certain period of time. This varies greatly by surgeon. My surgeon requires under 30 ml per day for two whole days. My collection bulbs were getting gross after a while, I rinsed them with water or rubbing alcohol. If you have any trouble with your drains, or if you don't have drains but have fluid building up, call your doctor/physician's assistant/nurse. Pain: you will be given medication for pain. The pain will probably be the worst for the first 24-48 hours after surgery. The first week if often hard as well. Many patients find it helpful to \"stay ahead\" of the pain, by taking medication when the pain reaches a certain level. I found that was helpful the first few days to a week. Then I started to taper myself of pain medication. If it was every 4 to 6 hours, I would try 5 or 6 hours. Being at home, you're in control and you don't have to wait for the next nurse to be available. Do keep a record of when you took your medication so you know when you can take your next. You may be surprised to see that the time between medications starts to spread out. Shower: again, up to your surgeon, and it depends on your bandages, your sutures, and your healing. I had my first shower on the third morning after surgery. I was to have my back to the shower head, and was allowed to have the water run down my breasts. Absolutely no direct stream on my breasts for a week or so. Sleeping: I had a BMx and I could not sleep on either side or stomach, and even sleeping on my back was uncomfortable. I sleep while propped upright in a reading pillow similar to this: http://www.amazon.com/Brentwood-Originals-Brushed-Twill-Bedrest/dp/B002S0NJNK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452955954&sr=8-1&keywords=reading+pillows+for+bed which was fine. My husband later bought be a bed-lounge: http://www.amazon.com/BedLounge-Classic-Regular-Natural-Cotton/dp/B006VQQOV6/ref=sr_1_3?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1452948252&sr=1-3&keywords=pillow+recliner which works just the same as the reading pillow. I can roll a little to one side or the other. This is how I have slept for the last 10 weeks. I did not want to rent a medical bed. Swelling and bruising: we all will have some, some will have more. If anything looks scary to you, ask your nurse. BMs: are not something that we usually talk about. Most folks get constipated by the anesthesia medications. Ask if you can start taking Colace (an OTC stool softener) in the days before and after your surgery. I had a 5 hour surgery. Although I was taking Colace before surgery, I did not have a BM until 5 days after surgery. The next several days my body played catch up. Catheter: seems to be standard for long surgeries. I was given one in March for neurosurgery and November for BMx. Fortunately, they wait until you're asleep. It doesn't hurt, and you don't have to worry about going to the bathroom with rubber legs. March catheter was fine. Mine was removed in the evening the day after surgery. Again, it doesn't hurt coming out. My November catheter leaked a bit so the nurse adjusted it. I did have a few drops of blood in my urine for a few days. Also, I was just a little incontinent for about two weeks. I think I got stretched a bit when the nurse adjusted it. I'm back to normal now. Photos: I posted earlier this month that you may want to take photos to document your journey. Best wishes to all. If you have any questions, I will be happy to share my experiences with you. Health, peace, and love to all, Mominator",

My BS told me about a planned nipple-sparing mastectomy where there was a small tumor in the outer quadrant. They were completely surprised when the tissue under the nipple tested positive. I do know the statistics for prophylactic surgeries: 10% of prophylactic mastectomies test positive for cancer. My PS said it's standard procedure to test ALL removed tissue. But I don't know if that is standard procedure for his group, our state, or the US. I hope it is the standard for all over the word, but it is certainly worth asking about pre-surgery. You ladies amazed me with your knowledge about treatments.",

Balthus: I hope you are resting today after yesterday's adventure. You may be overdoing it. stellamaris: I'm so sorry you had a reschedule out to March. We'll hold your hand in the meantime. Little milestone for myself: today I wore a pull-over top for the first time since exchange surgery. Love to all, Mominator",

Surgery was 5 hours and I spent another 10 hours in recovery because my blood pressure was too low, frequently lower than 80/40. They think it was a combination of anesthesia, pain meds, and nitroglycerin patches they put on my nipples. They bolused 3 units of saline to get my blood pressure about 80. I was sent to a cardiac unit for continued monitoring. They switched pain meds to address the blood pressure The day after surgery, the nurse started me on one Percoset, but it wasn't enough when I stood up for the first time. I was crying. The Breast Surgeon saw me soon after and insisted that I start walking. I thought she was nuts until I remembered that the nurse said that I could have 1 or 2. So I asked for 2 Percosets and that has made all the difference. The nurse was 15 minutes late for the next dose, and I could feel it wearing off. Throughout the day I did laps around the ward. I did a total of 0.99 miles according to my phone health app. They want me to keep walking and to keep doing the breathing exercises. The foley catheter was removed and I had \"good output\" so I was on my own for the bathroom that night. I was in the bathroom a lot exchanging those three units of saline. I have been running a fever of 100.1 but that doesn't seem to bother anyone. I also have been having strange visual disturbance of seeing wavy squiggles when I look at bright contrasts. This also is not bothering anyone. Yesterday I was really tired. It was a day of hurry up and wait. All three surgeons wanted to see me before I was discharged. I have just 4 small BSO incisions, which all look good. I had to go over BMX and drain care with the nurse yesterday. Until then, I had only seen little peeks of my breasts. Wow, what a mess it looks like now! The upper part of my breasts are hard and swollen. I'm sure that's where the TE's are. There is one big incision on each breast, with keyholes for the nipples (the batman marks were where the skin was removed). The lower part of the breasts are swollen and floppy. Both breasts look purple and swollen, with angry incisions, lots of bruising. The nipples are starting to pink up, but may still be in danger. Plastic Surgeon says that if we save them, it will be a major coup, since they had been hanging so low pre-surgery. Breast surgeon says it ain't over until the fat lady sings, they are pinking up. I really want to keep my nipples, but I'm too emotionally drained to worry about them. Today I feel so tired and I was nauseous. I was able to take a Zofran tablet, but I don't feel like eating. I so much want to be past all this. I don't want my two daughters to see me like this, but I can't hide it from them. One daughter was asking about the drains. The fluid in the J-drains went from mostly red in color to mostly yellow. Is that normal? I just put a call in to the doctor's office. Mominator",

Sunday I had my first shower and my breasts looked better. However, they were very hard, swollen and warm to the touch. I called the surgeon's office and the nurse on call said that it's normal, but I could come in on Monday. Monday and my breasts were still very warm to me. I saw the nurse. She was so good in answering my questions and she changed the gross dressings on my drains. Wow, what a difference! My breasts looked so much less scary with all that bloody mess cleaned up. Nurse said that I am very swollen and bruised, which is why my breasts feel so warm. She said all my incisions looked good. Tuesday, today, was my first post-op visit with the surgeon. (Almost) everything looks good, my incisions are healing well. I am still very swollen and bruised. There is one area on my left areole which is questionable. Surgeon wants to wait and see if it recovers. At my next visit, he may trim off that area. Surgeon also asked about the drains output. I showed him my record of drainage per day. \"Of course you have a record,\" he remembers my list of questions during our consult. He said the drains could come out if there is less than 30 ml of fluid for two whole days. Considering how swollen I am, if the drains help reduce the swelling, I can tolerate them. My mother didn't have drains for her surgery and she told me horror stories of having the fluid aspirated. BTW, everyone loves my telemetry bags for my drains! I've been trying to de-medical-ize myself. I stopped using the Percocet after Sunday night, and I have stepped down to extra strength Tylenol. I've been doing more stuff on my own: laundry, dishes, serving meals. We have plenty of leftovers right now, so I don't have to cook to much yet.",

As we expected, Plastic Surgeon had to do a lot of \"pocket work\" on both breasts. Also, PS removed some fat tissue that was just under the skin on the lower halves of both my breasts. The fat was keeping the skin stiff and slowing down the healing. The fat was \"not exactly necrotic\" but it was \"definitely not happy\" where it was. I don't know how much total he removed, but it was a lot. PS said he removed about 50 grams more from the right breast than the left. So that's why he put a bigger implant on the right side (495 gm) than the left (450 gm) to even them out. PS thinks the breasts look even now, or perhaps the left is possibly slightly bigger. Both breasts are really swollen, but are starting to shape up much better. I am happy with the results.",

Katykids, Wow, so you feel the TEs all in your armpit? Yuck. Are your breasts still numb at all? I'm wondering if you only feel it in your armpit if your breasts are numb or if your TEs are pushing into the sides. I haven't taken muscle relaxers for the spasms. This is the first fill since surgery 6 weeks ago and these muscle spasms are all new. I had weaned myself off Percoset 5 days after surgery, and Tylenol about 2-3 weeks after surgery. Right after surgery, my breasts were bruised and swollen and somewhat numb. Everything seemed to hurt, although I couldn't say what. Maybe I hadspasms then, but it was part of the overall pain. Now that the bruising and swelling has gone down, and the numbness is going away, I can now feel different things. These spasms are distinct, and are the worst first thing in the morning. Fortunately, I don't have them very often nor as strong through the rest of the day. I think my PS would expand me even more if I want, as my TEs have a 650 fill capacity. However, I'm at 480 now and my breasts actually look too big to me. My hubby thinks I look great now. But he has only seen me in clothes. He has said he would probably pass out if he saw the incisions.",

Anesthesiologist told me the gunk in my throat is from the anesthesia gases as she didn't need to use the tube on me.

Breast surgeon wants me to heal some more, and to get my drains out, before I can drive. One surprise is that the surgeon now wants me to start wearing a soft bra or camisole for support 24/7. No one had mentioned any bra until now. I thought most patients get a surgical bra if they need one. Since no one mentioned it, I thought I had a pass. Believe me, nothing is moving there. Rock hard TEs in the midst of swollen breasts. Now I have to go find some support. Next Tuesday, I see both the Gynecological Oncologist (for the BSO) and the Plastic Surgeon. The Gyn Onc will need to check my incisions. The Plastic Surgeon wants to check the questionable tissue on Leftie. Maybe it will slough off, or maybe he will trim it off. If my drains are below 30 ml for two whole days, the drains can come out. Maybe I'll get my wheels back then. A big question is what our little of 5 family is doing for Thanksgiving. We had made plans to travel to Massachusetts to visit with our family. Hubby's brother is hosting Thanksgiving on Thursday at his house, we would see the entire side of hubby's family then. My brother is hosting a smaller Thanksgiving for our side of the family on Friday. I would see my Mom, who has been in treatment for Stage III Invasive Lobular Cancer since Sept 2014. We will see how I feel on Tuesday, and make a decision then. Madelyn AKA Mominator BRCA2+, wife, mom to 3 children of various special needs, musician, volunteer, 54 yrs young",

The fluid in mine turned a bright yellow the day after discharge, then back to red, and then reddish-orange. Remember these drains work on a very weak vacuum. The tubing can get flat, then return to round. That happened to me once the flow dropped below 40 per day. Just remember after you empty the drains to squeeze the bulb/juice box before you put the stopper back on. That will help keep the vacuum. Do give your surgeon a call whenever you have a question. There are no dumb questions. I called twice over my first weekend home, on Saturday for the yellow fluid, and on Sunday the feeling of really hard, really warm breasts. Both turned out to be normal, but I went in to see the nurse on that first Monday and she was great. She cleared up my bandages, and told me that I was very bruised and swollen, and that was why my breast were hard and warm. By the time I saw the PS on Tuesday, I had three big questions answered. Good luck and let us know how you do.",

This is what this thread is all about. Each of us can share and help the other. November is over, but our journey has just begun. It will be months before all of us are healed.

I'm at week 5 and the swelling has really gone down a lot this week. Rightie is still oozing a little bit, and he would like to give the incisions another week to heal fully. So, the stitches won't come out until next week (week 6). Next week he will start fills. I was filled 420 ml during surgery. I had so many questions about sections that still hurt, or are bruised, ribs that hurt, the tightness in my armpit, and I can't lie or sleep on either side. All are normal. I had a lot of swelling and bruising because so much tissue was removed (812 gm on the right, 666 gm on the left). My antibiotic finally ends tomorrow. I don't have to put triple antibiotic cream on my incisions any more. I can use smaller gauze pads rather than the big ABD surgical bandages, as long as I have just a little something between me and the bra. I can start slowly with some exercises, just walking my fingers up the wall. He said BS can give me more exercises when I see her. This is not his area. I can also take my multivitamin (includes Vit E) and calcium/Vit D supplements again. Both were discontinued two weeks before surgery and had to stay off of the because of the debridement. I can stay on my supplements until two weeks before exchange surgery. All in all, I'm healing and getting back to normal.

Two mostly crescant-shaped incisions above my nipple, with keyholes for my nipple, and about two inches between the incisions. Looking down, it looks like the batman sign. He made similar marks for leftie, although just slightly smaller so that they will match for size. I should mention that I am currently 36C or D, although I was 38DD before I lost about 50 pounds. Both my breast surgeon and the plastic surgeon have mentioned that I have \"pendulous\" breasts. My PS made a point of \"warning\" me that he could not reconstruct me as large as I am now. \"Thank goodness\" was my reply.

DD#1 has Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and panic attacks. DD#2 has ADHD and fibromyalgia. Also, I had a big reduction when they did the BMX and expanders. Both the Breast Surgeon and the Plastic Surgeon noted that I had pendulous breasts. About 2 pounds of tissue was removed from each breast. Smurfette/Donna: praying that round 2 of chemo goes much more smoothly for you. TallnTerrific: thanks for the exercises. I'm nervous about the fills hurting, but I think I need to heal a lot more before he starts filling mine. He hasn't mentioned fills at all, as we had been working on those black patches. Also, thank you for the devotionals. Live4them and anyone else who wants to know: The debridement procedure was weird, not painful, and was like having an out-of-body experience. I was in an OR, on a table, freezing cold, and covered in blankets. He used plenty of local anesthetic and I was draped. Before he started, we talked about how we had waited to let the areas come back, and both breasts had pinked up considerably, however, there were still areas that weren't coming back and now it was time to take care of them and prevent infection. I didn't watch the proceedings, but I knew what he was doing, between the equipment in his hands and what he was saying to me and the assistants. Rightie, which was the better looking of the two, squirted out a bunch of fluid right at him. He joked that it was out to get him. He removed the dead tissue from both breasts and used two layers of sutures to close, which means that the black areas went deep. I'm glad that's behind me. I won't know how much was removed until I change the dressings tomorrow. I'm really not ready to look today. Nurse gave me some special bandages to use on the incisions over the next few days. You ladies are going to laugh at me. Remember that I had not been given any bras and I was not wearing any bras for two weeks? Well, once I got my surgical bras last week, I have been wearing them 24 hours daily, even though I had asked if I could not wear them overnight!! I noticed that both breasts were better shaped after just 8 hours in the bras, so I kept them on that first night and every night since. However, some days my ribs feel so sore, I had been leaving the last few hooks undone overnight to give myself a breather. I asked today's nurse if the bras were feeling a bit tight because I'm still swollen or are the bras are too small? She said it's hard to know. She gave me two bras of the next size bigger to let me try. She said that I could wear the new bigger size or the smaller bras with the last few hooks undone.

I hope everyone had a wonderful time with their families and friends. We visited both sides of our family in Massachusetts. My Mom is healed from her lumpectomy and axial dissection surgeries, and has finished her radiation treatments. She (80) and Dad (84) have both hurt their backs recently and are having trouble with daily activities. My brother and I are glad her doctors didn't recommend chemo. Live4them: I hope you are healing well, and lefty is doing well. I wanted the black patches to heal naturally, but PS felt it had pinked up as much as possible and he wanted to prevent infection. Let me know how your appointment went. As for my armpits, I'm a little less tight, but there is still muscle and tissue in my armpits. I told PS that I am a flutist, and when I play now I'm pressing against my breasts. He said that would be corrected during the exchange. Katykids, thanks for all that info. Natejordlee, I'm glad to see you're progressing. I'll be thinking of you as you start radiation next week. My Mom had rads both in 1997 and 2015. New_me/Diane: good to see you back. I'm glad your PBM was clear. TallnTerrific, I had some leakage during debridementand and a week after as well. We are still healing, which is so hard to tell family members who have been waiting to see us. I'm so sorry your sweet sister is dying. I hope you had a lovely visit with her. It's so good to see you Letsdothis/Cindie! I looked for you in the December thread but didn't see you. My drains got a little gross towards the end so I started rinsing them out, mostly with just water, but a couple of times with rubbing alcohol. Good to see you TikkasMom.

Kudos to your hubby for taking care of your incisions and removing the drains. Wow. I hope that your pneumonia has cleared by now. I am very sorry for the loss of your dear, sweet grandma. No driving still is also very hard. Enjoy the Game of Thrones. In case you haven't been warned: any character can die at any time. My heart has been broken a few times, but I let them live on in my imagination. Frill: I bet you would look cute in a sassy short haircut. In honor of you and all chemo sisters, I am changing my avatar to my shaving day when I participated in a St. Baldrick's fundraiser (http://www.stbaldricks.org/) in September. Are you having your recon before or after your Mx on the other side? I hope you gain your ROM soon. My hubby can't even look at my incisions. So no, I had no help at all with incision care and drains. I have my exchange surgery next week and I know I will have to do it all over again by myself. But I am looking forward to getting rid of the TE's. My left one has moved into my armpit and really hurts. Strength and healing to all. Love, Mominator",

In the morning I saw the Gyn Onc. My incisions were checked and everything is healing nicely. The incisions feel thick, which is the sutures under the skin. My belly is still all stretched out. All will return to normal eventually. In the afternoon I saw the Plastic Surgeon. PS says most of the incisions are healing up nicely. Both Lefty and Righty have patches of black skin that has started to slough off. PS spent some time debriding those patches, but he is concerned. Some of the black seems to go deep. He wants to be proactive and prevent any possible infections. He wants me to come to his surgery center next Monday to trim up and re-suture the black patches. Surgical coordinator says she's trying to get insurance approval today or tomorrow. I'm thinking, the patches have been getting better each week, and have really gotten a lot better these last two days. Do I really need another procedure? In regards to the bra issue: PS did NOT want me to wear a bra these past two weeks because he didn't want any pressure on those black patches. Now that the patches are settling down, he wants me in a surgical bra for support. I asked if 24/7 or just daytime, and he (relented?) said just daytime. Nurse gave me two nice, soft surgical bras. The bras are mostly comfortable, although some pressure on the bruises, and actually are quite pretty in a metallic gold fabric. ChiSandy, thanks so much for your post about bras. I bookmarked the HerRoom.com page. The bras looked very nice, and that will give me plenty of options down the road. Both Lefty and Righty have been putting out >30 ml per day for the last two days. So the drains came out today! Woo-hoo! Nurse was super gentle taking them out, and it was just uncomfortable not painful. She says each hole is the size of a pea. I don't know, I couldn't see and I'm not going looking. *I'm tired of seeing my body all beat up. I'm just going to leave those bandages on for a day or so. Another big deal is that I got clearance to drive again. Breast surgeon didn't give me clearance last Friday as she really wanted me to heal some more. I'm not going to push myself (promise), but it has been very difficult for me being grounded. I do not have family in the area, and my friends are dealing with their own issues. One friend's daughter is just completing treatment for Hodgkin's, and another friend's father had heart surgery. Other friends' work schedules are too demanding. Hubby works full-time, and already took off 3 days for my surgery. He's worried about jeopardizing his job (he was unemployed for 6 months last year). *Just a little whine: I'm the only one taking care of myself. No help at all from hubby or my daughters on any medical thing. I had to hide my drains at all times because it made my family feel woozy. No one helped me with my bandages or drains, or helped me put antibiotic on the sutures. Especially those first few days when I was so sore and everything felt awkward. Hubby will help me get in or out of a car, and get scripts and supplies from the pharmacy, but he didn't want to see anything. We're going to have a quiet Thanksgiving as well. Despite my progress, hubby & I have decided not to travel to Massachusetts for Thanksgiving. The long travel is going to be too much for me this early in my recovery.

At Tuesday's appointment, Plastic Surgeon cleaned up the skin that was sloughing off the black patches on both breasts. But there was still at lot of black on both, so he wants me to come to the Surgery Center on Monday morning to have a debridement procedure on the rest of the black patches. It will be done under local anesthetic. So then I was to make arrangements with the surgical coordinator. She gives me some paperwork and tells me that the Surgery Center will call me on Friday with my arrival time. The Surgery Center called. They don't have an arrival time for me. They just want to know how long it will take for me to get there. They will call me when it's time to come in. SC coordinator was not helpful at all. So I called back a few hours later, hoping that they will have gotten the schedule fixed by now. Nope. Another lady answered. All she could tell me was that the surgeon does all of the general anesthesia procedures first, then the local procedures. All she knows now is that I won't be first thing in the morning. I said I have young children. I can't be hanging by the phone all day. I would prefer it in the morning while the children are in school. She said, well, we will work with you. So I'm just supposed to go about my day, except be ready to drop everything and drive 45 minutes each way to the Surgery Center and have a little procedure done. Sheesh! I have a conference called scheduled Monday morning with the intake coordinator for DDD for my son. Then we have an orthodontist appointment scheduled for 3:30 for one daughter, and Physical Therapy at 4:00 for the other. Of course, I will have my phone with me at all times, prepared to tell these other professionals, Ooops, we can't come in today because I have to go have a procedure done. That should go over well.

I had black patches on top of my aureoles along the stitches on both breasts. It is caused by the lack of blood flow to those areas post surgery. My beast and plastic surgeon doctors watched the patches very closely. Part of them both recovered but not all. Last week, day 13, my PS made the decision for the debridement, which took place this Monday, day 19 I trust my PS that he got all the dead tissue. I'm sure that this is one of the many reasons we all are followed closely week to week. There are many other causes of necrosis in wounds (diabetes, infection, etc.), but both you and I were in excellent health before our PBMX and we don't have those risk factors. Our black patches were caused by the trauma of the surgery. I don't expect more patches to develop. You can talk with your PS about your concerns and ask if he expects this to be an ongoing problem. It sounds like he's striking a balance between being conservative not to take too much tissue and being careful that he got all the dead tissue. Sending you many more (((gentle HUGS))) Love, Madelyn",

I had totally forgotten that little tip until now, and there's no warning on the Percocet to take with food. I had two graham crackers and a banana, and then I felt much better. I had a benefit from being in the cardiac unit: my nurse put each of my drains in a telemetry bag. We hung the bags from my shoulders when I was walking.

You're so sweet to me. I'm sorry for all your regrets with your mom. My mom is on her second breast cancer. She had DCIS at age 62, and now Stage III invasive lobular in the other breast at age 79. I was surprised. Then she told me that she is BRCA+. She had forgotten to tell me back when she found out. Probably because I live 300 miles away. Believe me, if I had know she was BRCA+, I would have been much more proactive in her care. Her health team totally let her down. She didn't have any additional surveillance, or chemo prevention, or prophylactic surgery options offered to her. Love to all and my prayers to all the ladies on this journey.

There is a loose spot in the latticework where they slip underneath, and every winter. we see their footprints leading to that spot. We had a handyman fixing the front door and he offered to fix the latticework. No thanks. I like having bunnies under my porch. May you be happy, comfortable, and peaceful all through summer, with many more walks, visits, and cheese sandwiches. Sending love, light, and many prayers. Madelyn.",

It's sad that so many police encounters are now \"shoot first, ask questions later.\" I have similar fears for my autistic son. Although he is high-functioning, he does get stuck and will not always follow directions. Fortunately, my son is never alone, there's always a family member or a staff member with him at the group home (just placed). However, to protect him further, we will be registering him with the county's special needs registry. I like the \"sign language only\" sticker on the back windshield and carrying a card explaining things. That would be useful for many special needs people. There are many groups for parents and children with special needs, who will have many more resources for you. Because my son will always need a guardian,I've been looking into these folks: https://plannj.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PLAN... Their mission: \"Who will care for my loved one when I'm gone\" Worrying about my son keeps me up at nights as well. Finding the right resources can help. Wishing you peace as you make your plans for DD. Sending much love and prayers, Madelyn",

There is nothing pretty about breast cancer. I hate all the pink. My BS's office is awash is pink. She and her staff participate in several BC events every year. While I appreciate all the money they must raise, I wish, not just her office but all of cancer land, there was less emphasis on awareness (which has been accomplished) and more work for the prevention and cure of MBC. I had asked about the use of Toradol/Ketoralac to help prevent recurrence, and she said she doesn't use such things until they are tried and tested. Yes, I'm making a blanket out of the roses. Originally I was just trying to see if I could could use up some leftover yarn, with a smaller project, but then I fell in love with the patterns and will expand it to a blanket.",

Every year going out of state to buy illegal fireworks and setting them off all through the Independence Day weekend, also on New Year's Eve. One New Year's Eve he set off some fireworks. One hit my bedroom window and landed on the roof of my porch. It smoldered there for a few moments before it rolled off into the snow. I was seriously tempted to call the police. But that would have meant putting on daytime clothes, coats and boots (vs my warm pjs) and going outside and having to deal with the idiots at one in the morning. We were so happy when the noisy neighbors moved away!! I hope you are able to see the results of your flower seeding. Reminds me of a book we had. The character seeded all over the countryside.",

We were about to start treatment when I had a surprise pregnancy. After I finished nursing my third child, we tested my density again, and I was just on the edge of osteoporosis. So we knew it was the pregnancies and nursing that depleted my bones. We treated with calcium/vitamin D supplements, weight bearing exercises, and medication.

I wonder since you are mom to 6 littles, if your bones were possibly depleted doing the many pregnancies and possible nursing of your six children. It is certainly worth consideration.

It's worth the time you take to get comfortable as you may be there 30-60 minutes on the table. The numbing was just a little pinch and it didn't sting. After that was just weird pressure when they got the sample. Then they put in a marker and took another MRI. Your biopsy will probably be by mammo rather than MRI, since they usually use the same imaging technique as found the mass. However, the rest will probably be similar to what we've all described. Many prayers for benign results. ",

What can I expect in my situation? What are the pros/cons of this treatment? What can we do to alleviate these symptoms? Nana was almost 97 and her kidneys were failing. However her heart was already failing first. The doctors in the hospital were so quick to prescribe some things, without looking at the whole picture. One doctor even insisted that we put Nana on dialysis. Her PCP was so good. He wanted to know, \"what can I do for Nana? What do you want for Nana?\" We said that we wanted her to be comfortable, to enjoy her great-grandchildren while she could, and have a peaceful end. And she did.   If you have a worry or concern, ask your doctor. Wishing you peace and comfort, and all the best, especially in these difficult circumstances, Madelyn ",

For the family and friends that I've been with in hospice, after all possible therapies failed them, it has been a gradual decline of the body, managed pain, and passing in their sleep. For our beloved Nana (hubby's grandmother), she was slowly dying of Congestive Heart Failure, and her kidneys were failing because of it. She started hospice late January and they helped with her medications and supplies. She became more tired each week. She was moderately alert on Easter Sunday. By Tuesday, she wanted to go back to bed early. On Wednesday, she didn't want to get out of bed. She slept most of Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Saturday early evening her breathing became irregular, and she stopped breathing Saturday around 9:00 pm. For my friend Ann Marie, the pain from mouth/throat cancer was more severe. She was doing well in August, holding court in her home. She started hospice in September. Many medications were tried, but the pain could not be controlled. She decided on palliative sedation. She slept through the last week of her life. (Edited to add: She died October 5.) Palliative sedation is a controversial choice in some circles. I am not recommending it for anyone unless they have severe, uncontrolled pain. For my friend Lori, she is nearing the end of mbc. She has extensive mets to brain and spine. She has lost her sight and her speech. She no longer actively eats or drinks. She had been given food and water by others, but that is declining as well. (Edited to add: last Tuesday I helped her drink two cups of water, but Wednesday she didn't want any water. I don't know if hubby is still able to feed her this week.) She has lost a lot of weight. She doesn't seem to be in pain unless her Husband tries to move her. Today she opened her eyes several times while I was with her. I'm not sure if she understood when I spoke or sang to her. Once her lips seem to move, but no words came. For you, Blainejennifer, hospice will guide you through the process, helping you with pain, and managing your symptoms. It sounds like you want to be more prepared than your parents were. An excellent blog is that of Sherri Fillipo, (thank you Stephanie for introducing her to me) who recently passed http://www.sherrifillipo.com/  A former nurse, Sherri describes \"living and dying with metastatic breast cancer\" with elegance, and she describes the many services of her hospice. I wish you the very best on your journey. I will provide updates on Lori if you wish, or you may look over my threads on my friend: community.breastcancer.org/for...  Mominator ",

That planning is such a blessing to your family. My parents are both in their 80's, in poor health, and are not planning. They have wills, and are each other's medical and financial POA's. That's all. We the children have tried to get them to add a back up person(s) to the financial and health POA's, and our parents refuse to discuss it. They have not done cemetery plots, casket, certainly not their own obituaries. My father \"doesn't want to talk about that stuff\" and my mother doesn't want to argue with dad, nor make a decision without him. I tried to point out that after one of them becomes incapacitated, the other will be making all the decisions alone, and most likely in a very stressful situation. And if both of them become incapacitated, such as a car accident, we will be making decisions without their guidance. My siblings and I are very frustrated. Thank you for sharing.",

I remember one of Nana's hospice nurses saying that \"we all die the same, and yet it's different, and still it's the same.\" As contrary as that sounds, there are many things that are the same as people die: the body breaks down, organs fail, certain symptoms are the same. There are some variations: not everyone will experience the same symptoms. When the end gets closer, certain other symptoms occur (labored breathing, cooling of the extremities). The hospice books are very helpful in that regards; also, talking with hospice nurses and aides. When Lori's breathing got labored on Tuesday morning, it was a sign that the end was very near. I have a longer post on Lori's funeral, if you are interested. That is more along the lines of how someone will be remembered. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/144/topics/842954?page=1#post_4724416 Mominator",

Without knowing your exact town, I was able to find HPCANY - Hospice and Palliative Care Association New York (check out www.hpcanys.org and www.hpcanys.org/find-care) which seems to service upstate NY. You can then search for your zip code or county.  Also, I suggest you can ask you MO for recommendations. Ask your MO about your anticipated medical needs and cleanliness needs. Ask about coverage of pain in the home vs a hospice center setting. Your MO should know what's available in your area and what your anticipated needs will be based on your disease progression. After that, I'd suggest touring a few facilities. You may find facilities you definitely do or don't want to go to them. Ask the hospice providers what would be provided in a facility vs in home. In addition to nurses and aides, many hospice programs also have volunteers who provide added coverage. I've been involved in hospice three times: for hubby's grandmother, and for two close friends. Nana was already in an assisted living facility. Hospice came in and added whatever care the assisted living didn't. Both friends chose hospice at home. Ann had two adult daughters who tended to most of the care. Lori had a husband and a few of us close friends who cared for her, plus hospice services were added in the last two months. Wishing you all the best, Madelyn ",

Are all your financial documents and estate planning in order? Have you planned your final arrangements? Are there some sentimental items you wish to give to family or friends? Are there some things you wish you could do if you were feeling stronger? Perhaps you could get some things done with some help. Maybe family or friends could help you? Maybe there are some resources available (volunteers from high school or church or cancer centers)? Here are some thoughts from the person left behind. I really miss my Mom. I wish I had something tangible of hers, such as a piece of jewelry, that I could wear. We, (my siblings and I), were really concerned about Mom and Dad's health issues over the last several years. Our focus was taking care of both of them, as they were in and out of hospitals and rehab facilities. Mom and Dad were both in denial of the seriousness of their health issues. Mom and Dad were both paranoid about  \"stealing our money\" or \"sticking us in a nursing home\" if we could, plus Mom had dementia, which she and Dad hid from us.  I wish my parents were open and honest with us, and allowed us to help them more. My parents were unprepared every step of the way. We had asked my parents several times to get their financial documents, estate planning, and final arrangements in order. They didn't do anything except just basic wills. Their POA's and Medical Proxies were just for each other, without a secondary person. I tried to explain to my mother that the surviving person will be forced to make funeral arrangements for their late spouse, rather than discussing it together. Exactly that happened, as Mom was already on hospice (and her dementia prevented her from making decisions) when Dad and my siblings made the basic funeral arrangements. After Mom died, my siblings wrote the obituary, and I arranged the funeral music and readings. Our overriding question was always, \"What would Mom have wanted?\" Maybe other families are more prepared. I makes me sad that my parents didn't prepare, not let us help them prepare. ",

I've seen you on some other threads, but we've not had a chance to talk to each other. I like your most recent photo, really lovely. Although the funeral or memorial service is for the family, you may want to plan it with your family now. Nana did not pre-plan her funeral mass, and we were scrambling to get the details that would honor her choices and favorites. We wracked our brains trying to remember favorite songs and passages from the scriptures. Fortunately, the rest (casket, plot, engraving on the headstone, etc.) were already done. Ann Marie did pre-plan her funeral right down to the songs and scriptures. She was a cantor and choir member. I played flute for her funeral. Barbe, your experiences of less than a week in hospice are similar to many others. Most people wait until the very end before they use hospice. Hospice is available for those whose conditions are expected to be terminal in six months or less. Blainejennifer, I suggest you ask your doctor to let you know when to call hospice. \"Hospice is special because it concentrates on care, not cure. It enables people with a terminal illness to make decisions about how and where they want to spend the rest of their lives. Hospice Care treats the whole patient. The family is viewed as part of the unit of care. It emphasizes pain control and living life fully.\" from https://hospicecarecorp.org/frequently-asked-quest... Still, I hope you have a while before you need hospice. Mominator",

She explains the dying process (the last few days of a person's life). She describes how a patient sleeps more and more, becoming unconscious for longer and longer periods. But when the patient wakes up, they feel as if they've had a really good sleep. So we know that it doesn't feel frightening. She also explains how the breathing slows down, and the sounds a person makes towards the end. Please don't be put off by the beginning line, \"dying probably isn't as bad as you're expecting.\" She talking about the process of dying (unconsciousness, breathing slowing, gradual death), is not as painful as people expect. She's not talking about the shortening of lives and sadness from the terrible toll of cancer.  https://www.facebook.com/bbc/videos/2185162658165588/ ",

It becomes uncomfortable to eat and people stop eating. http://www.arborhospice.org/we-can-help/nutrition This happened with my friend Lori. It was distressing to watch her husband feed her, as she had no appetite and he was forcing the food into her mouth some mornings. (Husband really didn't take the time to read the hospice information. It just sat in a folder on the counter.) Unfortunately, most terminal patients have anorexia, which a loss of appetite and most develop cachexia, which is the loss of weight. Cachexia cannot be reversed nutritionally; even if the number of calories consumed increased, the terminally ill person will continue to lose weight. Her husband seem to feel that if he could keep feeding her, he could keep her with him longer. Nana and Ann also lost their appetites. The difference was that no one was force-feeding them. Anorexia/loss of appetite is the body's way to keep itself comfortable as the digestive systems slow down.",
