Upon review of further ultrasound pics, the Dr. said he believes it is just older breast tissue, and asked me if I wanted to have biopsy or follow up every 3-6 months to check on the cyst. I told him since I was there, to do biopsy as I did not want this hanging over me every few months. He said that it was a good choice to get some samples now. I think it is a positive thing that the Dr./surgeon said this, but I should get results by this Friday. Anyone had this issue?. Of course, not over until I get results later this week. Thanks for your continued support.",

So stressful and difficult to go to work, get ready for holidays, take car to the shop. Those normal things are so difficult right now. Getting more migraine headaches and took Excedrin today, and I read note that I should not take anything with aspirin. I had no choice or migraine would get worse and I would not make it work. Spiraling out a bit here. Thank you all for sharing your stories and insight.",

It's been a long week, feels like a month. Trying to get as many holiday gifts shipped before Monday, as I am told I will not be able to lift anything heavy for a couple days and I leave for holidays on 12/21. In case I get bad news, at least I won't have the additional stress of trying to still finish up my shipping. After 12/12, I will be back to waiting, this time for results of biopsy. Let us know what happens, I will do the same.",
