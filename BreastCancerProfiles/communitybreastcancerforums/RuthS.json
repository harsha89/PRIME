I have also gotten a great deal of important information from all of you, especially Trigeek. Thank you so much! I also wanted to let you know something important I learned this week. I had been running and working out for about an hour + each day and all was going very well. However, I did not realize how for up under my arm the radiation zone went and did not apply my ointments high enough or far enough toward my back. As as result the normal friction of a walking or running motion with my arms has caused the skin to \"break down\". It is not an actual blister, but it appears the top layer is history. I was spared treatment on Friday because the machine was broken and hope that a switch to silvadine and the 3 day brake will allow it to heal enough to resume tx on Monday. I don't think this would have happened had I applied the creams fully under my arm. I have completed 23 of 33 tx with the last 5 being boosts. Hope you are all having a great weekend!

I was 8 months pg at diagnosis and know that I could not have made it through my battle without the distraction of my new little girl and 5yr old son.  Bless you and your new family!   I also want you all to know that your conversations here were my lifeline just as I am sure they were/are for the many others that were \"lurking\".  Thank you for allowing me to easedrop and giving support you never knew was happening :-) ",

I have completed 23 of 33 and now have exposed, or \"broken down\" skin under my arm. I started on the silvadine friday, but am worried about getting it all off before tx. I am using ivory soap to bathe, but it still feels like there is a film of the cream on my skin, any suggestions?",

I have lurked here and on the Sept chemo board and know how hard you have worked to get back in shape. I know I felt better after he told me that and I knew that it wasn't because I wasn't trying hard enough. I am sorry that I have not been able to contribute to the discussions on the boards (2 small children), but I also wanted you all to know that you have helped me tremendously through this rough journey since dx in July 2007.",
