There are definitely pros and cons to socialized medicine - it's not free (we have really high taxes) and there are long wait times for lots of procedures and tests and doctors don't stay in Canada - they do better financially and academically in the USA.   Carolyn ",

I was successful in getting a copy of the diagnostic mammogram report today and although the report shows pleomorphic linear calcifications in 2 separate areas, I at least know what was found and what the outcome could potentially be.  I have done a lot of research so I'm not going into the procedure on Monday thinking all is well - I know there is the potential for this to be DCIS and I am prepared for that.

I have been patient as there is nothing I can do to speed up the process but that doesn't mean that the anxiety has not been heightened and had a huge impact on my day to day living.  This is who I am and I can't change that. ",

I have a wonderful husband and he has been very supportive but like many spouses/partners, he reassures me by saying \"everything will be okay\".  I have tried to be strong and say that I know this but last night I broke down and had my first long cry.   I know that this is a very supportive discussion board and I think I need this support now.   Thank you for letting me bare my soul!

I went to my PCP's office yesterday to see if they had the results and the receptionist looked through the computer file and said there was nothing yet and then she said the two words no one waiting for results ever wants to hear - \"Don't worry\".  I didn't know whether to scream at her or to do what I seem to do best these days and start crying.  Instead, I looked her straight in the eyes and said, very matter of factly, \"I AM WORRIED\" and I left the office. As I was driving out of the parking lot, she came running out and told me that there is no record of a biopsy being done in the office.  I told her I didn't have a biopsy in the office, I had a biopsy at the Breast Health Centre.  She said, \"OH\" and I said, \"Now you should know why I am worried\".  She got some details from me and said she'd check with the BHC either that afternoon or today and would get back to me.  She told me she had worked at the BHC and understood what I was going through (I doubt it!) and then, she called me \"Dear\" and said \"Have a good day\".   I appreciate that many people don't know what to say when someone has a health issue, but to have someone in a medical office that doesn't know what the situation is brush a patient's concern off is reprehensible.   I will be calling the Breast Health Centre myself today to see if they have received the results.  I know they can't provide the results to me but if I know they have been released to my PCP, I will go back to the office and request them from her.   I have never been one to accept the status quo but this situation over the past 2 months has made me realize that we need to be empowered women where our health is concerned.   Carolyn  Log in to post a reply",
