Have you heard of Pagets disease?  It is a rare breast cancer that is in the nipple and it is usually one side. I am concerned that I may have Pagets disease of the breast.  One my nipple constantly itches and tingles.  I recently had an ultrasound but the doctor told me not to drink any coffee or soy milk for one to two weeks.  If that doesn't help then they will probably do a biopsy! I am 32 years old and nervous about this but I trust God no matter what happens. I hope all is well with your biopsy!  Please post when you get your results! Take Care Hope",
