I am trying to put these negative thoughts out of my head and most of the day i am ok but then i feel the pain in my breast and thats when all the thoughts keep flooding back in. I have had a diagnostic mammo and US and have had my breasts examined by 4 doctors but i still feel like something is being missed partly because the pain symptoms started after I found the lumpy area. I have decided that at this point I am going to just put it out of my mind till february when I have my follow-up mammo. Hopefully, the pain is just because of the vitamin d deficiency. Thanks once again for all the replies!",

Basically, 34 years old found a lumpy area in my left breast after weaning my son after Breastfeeding him for almost 2 years. Did diagnostic mammo and ultrasound - came back with dense tissue and some benign calcifications. I have to go back in feb to follow up those calcifications. Since finding this in august, started having some breast pain too so went to all these different doctors. All of them do a breast exam and then just dismiss me by saying that its all normal - jsut fibrocystic and nothing to be concerned about. Have asked for an MRI but the breast surgeon and OB/GYN says there is no need for it. Meanwhile, my breast pain continues. My family is sick of my constant worrying. My husband has been patient but after going to 5 doctors and being told by them that it is normal, his patience is wearing thin. My qs is should i just back off and wait for my diagnostic mammo in feb to check it out or what? I want to believe all of them that i am over-reacting but the pain doesn't seem that way. I get it in both breasts but it is more in my left than the right. p.s. have also been diagnosed with a severe vitamin d deficiency last month that was causing all over body pain...so not sure whether to attribute the breast pain to that?

I was supposed to go see a Breast specialist on the 19th of sept. but her office had an opening on monday and called me earlier. Basically, the specialist/surgeon did another breast exam (same way as my PCP) and said the same thing that everything felt very normal and that the lumpy area was just that - lumpy. She said that breast goes through a lot of changes during pregnancy and breastfeeding and what i was feeling was all related to it. She also went over the mammogram and US reports and agreed with the recommendation in 6 months to followup on the calcifications although they looked benign to her. She said that since this was my 1st mammogram they had nothing to compare it to so they were asking me to return in 6 months. I am a worrier by nature and a bit of a hypochondriac too so i needed to do this to give me peace of mind.",

Felt a lumpy area in my left breast so went to get it checked out by my dr. I had been exclusively nursing my son from this breast for the 6-7 months before weaning him. The dr. felt it was not abnormal and just a little lumpy but sent for an US just because i was worried. The US did not show anything abnormal so a digital mammo was ordered to make sure nothing was missed. I was given a screening mammo and then a diagnosstic one. This is the summary of the report i received from them: breast tissue is dense. slightly more dense glandular parenchyma in upper outer quadrant of left breast compared to right. some scatered calcifications are seen in both breasts probably most numerous in upper outer quadrant of left breeast. calcifications are fairly uniform, small rounded ones. 6 month follow up left mammogram with mag. views is recommended to follow calcifications. The radiologist said they didnt see anything concerning regarding the lumpy area on the mammo or ultrasounds. I was assigned a birad 3 score and asked to come back in 6 months.My qs is if these could be related to my just weaning my son less than 2 months back. Any thought would be appreciated. Do you feel i need a second opinion to a breast specialist? I spoke to my PCP (who herself is a BC survivor) and she said there really is no need for a second opinion and she fully expects the follow-up in 6 months to show nothing. Log in to post a reply",

I am not too worried about the calcifications since the radiologist that i spoke to said they were benign but was only asking me to come back in 6 months since this was my first mammo and they had nothing to compare it against. I am worried about the lumpy area that did not show up on mammo or US. The US tech said that he couldn't see anything in that area just glandular tissue but it still feels lumpy to me like there are multiple lumps there. I have not been very vigilant about doing breast exams so i dont know if this was always lumpy or if it is something new. This is why i am going to a breast specialist so that she can feel the area and go over the report and tell me that it is nothing to be concerned about.",
