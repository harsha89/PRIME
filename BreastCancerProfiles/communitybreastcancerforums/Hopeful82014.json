Were you offered this option? Were any of you not able to use or benefit from this option for any reason? What, if anything, did your RO or others tell you about the technique. I know it's too soon to see long-term patterns but would appreciate reading anyone's experiences with it. Thank you! Dx IDC Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Hopeful82014 wrote: Hi - I'm having 2 biopsies next Wednesday a.m. and am stressing, of all things about my bra! I thought perhaps one of you who've been through this might have some useful advice.  I've been told to wear a supportive bra afterwards and that I should sleep in it that night. I HATE sleeping in a bra, particularly an underwire, which all of mine are at this time, despite the fact that I have relatively small breasts. A sports bra was one suggestion but I always feel like I'm strangling myself getting into them, so I don't use one generally. I thought I'd spend some of the holiday weekend shopping for something that might work.  I've also been told that some biopsies are wrapped, post-procedure, with an Ace bandage that stays on until the next day. Does this go over the bra, under, or instead of the bra? I'd almost rather go that route, frankly.  Any insights would be very welcome. Thanks - and enjoy your holiday weekend.
