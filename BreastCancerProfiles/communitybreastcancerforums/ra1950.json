Maybe I won't have any SE's.  I don't know.  My other 2 cancers were treated with surgery only so this is a first for me.  After rads I will be on AI for 5 yrs.  I'm just in a rocky place right now but am grateful my surgery was a good outcome, I have a job that is supportive, I have loving family/friends, and faith my Higher Power will get me through this, even if it's with me kicking and screaming. Please add me to the Fall 2015 Rads list.  Thanks for listening.",

      "Content": "Nov 11, 2015 07:15PM - edited Nov 11, 2015 07:25PM by ra1950 Hi all. I completed 26 of 28 of my full breast rads today. Will have 5 boosts next week and be DONE on 11-20!  I am blessed to have wonderful rad techs that help the process immensely. My rad doc has zero bedside manner and does not listen to her patients. As many of you have reported, my doc always answers \"it's not the rads\" when I've experienced headaches, nausea/vomitting and lack of appetite. Good thing I only see her for 5 minutes every Thurs. I am so lucky that my employer allowed me to be off for treatment. I knew I could make myself do it, but decided to reduce the stress in my life by not working. I have experienced quite a bit of rash/itching but am fortunate my skin has not split open. I am hoping the boost treatments will not cause severe damage. I am grateful to be almost complete with this part of my journey. I will start Arimidex next week. Blessings to all.",

I will return to work 11-30. I started Arimidex 11-21 and the only SE seems to be some dizziness that passes in a few hours. I may have to start taking it closer to bedtime. I am so grateful to have made it through surgery and radiation.",
