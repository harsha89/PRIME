Apart from this, physcically my aunt is in reasonably good health--the only medication she takes is Aricept (for memory issues, which are becoming worse and worse--hence my concern about the surgery).  But she is frail, not able to take care of herself or walk very far.  She is now in 24/7 care to ensure that she eats (and eats well), bathes, wears clean clothes, etc. Sounds like the path forward is surgery, with fingers crossed.  I am likely the decision maker, by the way, given her confusion; she won't remember the diagnosis or the decision with any clarity.",
