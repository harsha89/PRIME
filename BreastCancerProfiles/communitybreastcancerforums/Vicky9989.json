I'm 27 and have only really started to examine my breasts properly this last month or two. Well I found what feels like a pea sized lump on my left breast, went to the doctors and originally she wanted to wait to see if it disappeared after my period in 2 weeks but I went back today as noticed my nipple sinks in a little bit when laying down and I now have a scan next week. I have totally convinced myself I have it and I won't have long left. The only reassurance I am taking is that it seems to move around quite easy. I have no history of breast cancer in my family but I am worrying myself sick, I can't focus on anything else and I'm finding it hard to carry on with life, just constantly sitting on my phone googling I have two young daughters and I'm so so scared. Is anyone in the same position at the moment waiting for tests?? Petrified Log in to post a reply",

I have checked around my other breast and I do feel lumps but not as defined as the one on my left breast ðŸ˜¢. Both of my breast look the same, Have just convinced myself of the worst, and now I can't think of anything else, I can't function and cant sleep for long. I do have a problem with catastrophizing things so I think I may call the doctor for something for my anxiety. Thank you for replying again and giving me the chance to write down my feelings. I just read about your mom and wanted to send you a big hug, sending a little prayer your way for her xx",

      "Content": "Vicky9989 wrote: Hi I'm 28 from the uk. Last month I found a small bean shaped lump in my outer upper side of my left breast, it was moveable and after prodding it was a little tender. I went for a ultarascan and they straight away said it was a lymphanode (in fact there was 2 but hadn't felt the other one) she said it was a normal size, not suspicious and that was that. Well this month (about 3 weeks after ultrasound) just before my period I noticed a dull pain that comes and goes from that side of my breast, I waited until a week after my period had stopped but the pain is still coming and going, sometimes under arm pain too and down the side, shoulder blade and the breast all on the same side. I went back to the doctor who said lymphanodes can go up and down and to come back if it got any worse. I am extremely anxious about health in general and am currently walking around nearly in tears that something is wrong. Do i push for more testing? Or take reassurance from the ultrasound that was only 4 weeks ago? I have read ultrasounds are quite accurate on spotting anything suspicious so trying my best to take comfort in that?

Well the third time, I broke down in tears and said I'm not reassured, and the doctor has now referred me again to the breast clinic so am currently waiting for my appointment. The pain Is by no mean intense, doesn't wake me up when I'm sleeping etc... but it just feels like something's there in the same area as the 'lymphanode' like a pinching and is tender when pushed. I am worried sick and am finding it hard to carry on with day to day life. What testing do I need to insist on? A biopsy of the lymphanode? 3D mammogram or MRI? If they only do an ultrasound again should I take comfort in that? I really need to know what to push for before I go. All this is really effecting my mental wellbeing and I'm struggling ðŸ˜¢ Xxx",

Patient reassured. I would be reassured and would of left it at that if the pain wasn't accompanying it ðŸ˜¢. Unsure where to go from here",
