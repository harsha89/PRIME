I am praying for everyone as well, not just myself, I felt I was being selfish only thinking about myself when there are so many other wonderful women (and men too) going through this experience. I am going to call the doctor's office today in the afternoon even though it makes me sick to my stomach to even think about it. I will keep everyone posted.",

Honestly, I feel that I would've rather been told it was a cyst cuz those tend to be benign right? But wouldn't they have known that right from the ultrasound? I have so many scenarios in my head and I am so scared. I pray we both get good results.",

I am ecstatic. She said it would be wise to follow up in six months for a breast exam and an ultrasound and I will definitely be doing that. Thanks so much to everyone and their kinds words. I pray everyone gets great results as well. PS. If you are in California or can make the trip, I highly recommend the UCLA Revlon Breast Cancer Center. Everyone is so kind and everything happens so fast.",

      "Content": "das_madchen wrote: I've been lurking for about a week and I have to say, everyone here is so wonderful. Here's my story. I've been hesitant to make an account. It's rather stupid, but I felt that by making an account, I was somehow making a breast cancer diagnosis a reality. Silly, I know. However, I am going nuts waiting for my biopsy results. I might hear back tomorrow, at the earliest. Most likely by Friday. I found a lump about a month and a half ago and I honestly don't know if it had been present before. I ignored it cuz I was scared. It felt round and mobile, which I took to be a good sign (after my extensive GOOGLE reasearch). About two weeks ago, I decided I needed to get it checked. Went to my local Planned Parenthood, was checked by a PA. No offense to any PAs, I'm sure they are smart people, but they are not MDs nor breast specialists. He told me it was most likely a fibroadenoma since it was highly mobile and I should just monitor it. I left feeling slightly better, but not 100% satisfied. I kept getting a nagging feeling inside me and I listened to it. After some online research, I made an appointment at the UCLA Revlon Breast Cancer Center. First of all, they were wonderful. I saw them quickly and the doctor who saw me IS a breast specialist (obviously). She said the same thing- most likely fibroadenoma, but she sent me for an ultrasound. Another doctor did the ultrasound (the same day and no more than 30 minutes after the initial exam) and she was concerned that a part of the lump was not completely round and defined. She said that at my age it was most likely fibroadenoma, but I definitely needed a biopsy. My stomach sank. I felt like I was given a death sentence. I felt so alone and I wanted to cry. However, I put up a brave face and said okay, let's do this. It's kinda funny though, I went into that appointment determined to ask for a biopsy since this is the only way to really know and when I got it, I was scared. I wanted a biopsy, but I didn't want the doctor to feel that I needed it. Does that make sense? Oh and also, my doctor who recommended the biopsy told me that she also needed one once, I guess trying to comfort me. I take that as a good sign right? I hope she wasn't giving me false hope. Ugh this is really lengthy and I apologize. Luckily, their 1:00 pm appointment canceled, however, they actually did the biopsy at around 10am or so.  Anyway, I had a core needle biopsy which was relatively painless. The doctors and technicians present had some trouble getting the tissue since the lump appeared to move a lot. They also had a few laughs which at first I found unprofessional, but in retrospect, I found reassuring. If it was cancer, they wouldn't be laughing would they? Now I am waiting. I can call tomorrow for preliminary results but I am TERRIFIED. I am going through all these moods- one minute I KNOW i'm fine and the next I KNOW it's cancer and I'm going to die. These situations sure change your perspective on life don't they? I have only told my co worker about this since I see her almost everyday and we are like sisters. The guy I'm dating hasn't been the most supportive and I am even considering dumping him after this. I know guys deal with this diffferently but he really doesn't seem to care. Right now, though, he is not that important. Lastly, I have no BC history that I know of. I do like to drink a lot and that scares me cuz I know alcohol consumption can increase risk. However, I have heard of so many stories of healthy, active women getting cancer that I don't feel this is a huge deal. And I admit, I've been drinking a lot lately, trying to feel better about this. I know it's not good, but I can't help it. Thank you for reading, if you made it this far. I'm just so anxious- it's not fair, I'm 26, I shouldn't have to deal with this- well really, nobody should :(  C'est la vie? Log in to post a reply",

It's kinda funny cuz I am a USC (University of Southern California) alumni, but I chose the UCLA center (rival school, silly I know) because it is \"the best in the West\" and one of the top in the nation. I feel that I can definitely trust their judgement. It just sucks waiting and it sucks more because I don't have many shoulders to cry on (by choice- I do NOT want to worry my parents, siblings, etc.). I really appreciate your response. Can you tell me more about your experience beacon800?",
