Wednesday is an appointment with the Radiology Oncologist. I should say it was DCIS, intermediate grade, VERY small amount, less than 1 mm, very very tiny group of calcifications. They had to get a second opinion on the stereotactic biopsy they did. Came back malignant. My surgeon said he \"got it all\" (his words) and with \"good clear margins\" (his words). I am requesting and will probably go pick up tomorrow ALL my records from the surgeon's office, including the biopsy from the lumpectomy. I really feel I need to read all this myself. I am VERY VERY leery of this radiation thing I must admit. VERY. The anesthesiologist (just before the surgery) asked me if I'd ever had a heart attack. I said not that I was aware of, why? He said that the EKG shows what looks like I might have had a heart attack at some time. Say what??? UGH! I am greatly concerned about the possible (although rare they say...) damage to heart and lungs and that the ribs get weakened. I am not sure the possible risks of side effects outweigh the benefits of doing this. Supposedly left side, which mine is, can be a slightly greater risk. I smoked for 46 years, quit completely on October 29, but I am sure my lungs aren't the healthiest yet. Then there's the heart thing. And the ribs. Yikes! So, I guess I will ask her about all of this, but I'll tell you, I am really leaning toward NOT doing it (rads). Hubby feels pretty much the same way, although he will support me in whatever I decide to do. I am wondering if I should get a second opinion? Or just say no?! I sometimes feel that the status quo is what happens with these things. Like, \"this is what we always do in these cases....\" Anyone with similar fears etc, and how did you decide and deal with it? Thanks! Bobbi",
