    "Content": "Jun 13, 2016 09:06PM - edited Jun 13, 2016 09:09PM by NOLAnative I recently had a double mastectomy with DIEP reconstruction. In my case I had DCIS in one breast but the area was too large for a lumpectomy. Once I knew that a lumpectomy was not an option, the decision for my surgery was easy to make. My reason for this post is to say that as a New Orleans native; I know that the St Charles Ave breast center has a wonderful reputation and I'm not trying to take anything away from them. I even met with one of their surgeons for a second opinion. But since they were out of network for me I choose my surgeon from the Ochsner system and the Tansey Breast center at Ochsner. I had a team of surgeons for my surgery. Dr Ralph Corsetti performed my masectomies (head of the Tansey center). and he collaborated with Dr Hugo St Hilaire for reconstruction at the same time (he is the head of the LSU plastic surgery Dept) but has privledges at Ochsner. )As an aside the DIEP flap Procedure was developed at LSU. I am 3 weeks post surgery and I am very pleased with my results. If anyone feels that the Breast center is not an option for financial reasons and is either in the New Orleans area or wants to travel here for surgery; Iwould highly recommend my team of doctors.",
