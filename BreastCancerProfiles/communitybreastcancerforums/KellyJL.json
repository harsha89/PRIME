I am having the exact same issue and it's really worrying me. Diagnosed with shingles, and had a small rash on my back but no where else. But EXTREMELY painful breast, even more so than my back where the rash was (though my back was also painful). It's now nearly 2 weeks on and my nipple (mostly just the nipple, not the breast as much) is SO DAMN itchy. It is also much bigger than the other nipple, which I hadn't noticed before, and quite red. I've also noticed there are tiny little white bumps on the nipple (around the erect part), I don't know if this is maybe shingles rash. The rash on my back is almost gone now but the skin is still itchy there too. Hope you're able to reply. Thanks.",
