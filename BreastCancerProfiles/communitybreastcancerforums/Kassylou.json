Many doctors and hospital have plans to help people with no insurance so be sure to ask about that when you call. I work at a hospital and would be happy to do some research for you. Tell me what town, state, your age, what else you want me to know and I will be happy to help find a solution, be sure to private message me the info. I am recovering from a bilateral mastectomy done on the 23rd of jan. I feel good and have the time to help. Kas",
