I met with my RO last week and had a CT simulation scan on Monday. I will be receiving 33 treatments targeting the site of the tumor, top of the breast (mammary glands), armpit, chest wall on right side, and upper right back area. I'm sure I'll have questions/concerns as I proceed, and I'm sure this group will be just as helpful and as encouraging as the Taxol group. In fact, after reading only a few posts I've noted different suggestions for lotions/creams. Thanks in advance! Donna",

My treatments were cancelled for a week because of the widespread power outages, but I'm back on track again. This morning I had my 20/33 treatment. The past two days my clavicle area is noticeably red and painful. I've been using coconut oil and Jean's Cream. Yesterday I cut some fresh aloe, but even this didn\"t take away the burning sensation. I'm concerned about still having 8 more treatments and 5 boosts remaining. Several months ago, I made reservations for October 18th to fly to Illinois to visit family. Since missing a week of treatments I won't finish until the day before my planned departure. I'm concerned about fatigue. For those of you who are nearing the end of 30+ treatments, would you advise that I postpone my trip? I've read that sometimes symptoms continue or worsen for up to two weeks after completion of treatments. Thanks for any words of wisdom you can share. ",

I have had severe shoulder pain since my first treatment. (I had my 8th out of 33 treatments today). My chiropractor thinks it's a pinched nerve caused by the tightening muscles from holding my arm above my head for 30 minutes. My RO prescribed a muscle relaxant which hasn't seemed to help. I've been taking Aleve and icing my shoulder before and after each treatment. The nurses suggested a cortisone shot which I was scheduled to have yesterday, but when I arrived for my appointment the the office was closed due to Hurricane Irma! Tomorrow's and Monday's treatments have also been cancelled due to the hurricane. Perhaps my shoulder will have a little time to heal. MamaOz, Mimi, Rebamac, mmbNaplesFL, and any other Florida gals - I'm praying this hurricane moves farther east and back into the Atlantic, but if not, be safe! Regarding the use of lotions, my surgeon recommended Jean's Cream which was developed by a nurse with BC. I ordered it from Amazon and have been using it along with fractionated coconut oil. Also, I was very nauseous during chemo but had not had any issues with radiation until last night. I assumed it might have been something I ate, but I'm not feeling well this evening so maybe it is a SE. All in all, radiation is a piece of cake compared to chemo!",
