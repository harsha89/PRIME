I had a few problems healing so the doc ordered a CT scan. Well, went to see the Onc Fri, and he gave me another 6 week break but wants me to have my gallbladder removed because I have gallstones and a thick walled gallbladder with fluid, he found by looking at the CT scan report. My mom researched it and she said that it could cause diarrea constantly (like I dont have that free flowing one minute and stopped up the next already) I know that it will be another lapro surgery but have any of you ladies had this done? I keep telling my family that if they want to take things out of me that I wish they would take things that weigh more than these tiny organs, but they tell me I need the heavy ones?!?  Edited to say that I already had a partial Hyst about 5 years ago for Endometreosis. Still baffles me why the Onc didn't suggest having them removed then.  I already had BC once by then.

On that note, I called the Onc today to get the results of the TMs and low and behold, they didn't run the test! This is the second time! So now, I have to go in Monday after my appointment with the General Surgeon to schedule my surgery, to give them more blood!  All I know is that they better not even charge me for the Labs! What is it about me? First not giving me my woosy meds before surgeries and then not getting my TMs done?  Sorry to vent, today my nerves have just been shot, Xanax hasn't even helped!

This time when I went in because I was having pain under my ribs and my numbers were out of whack, he told me it was in my liver and the game plan was 6 rounds of Abraxane/Avastin. I trust my Onc and never questioned his plan. I didn't know that receptors could even change between Dx's until I found this forum. Never had the desire to research because I found the lumps early and I could do my Chemo and it would go away, so I thought until the word mets. So I asked him about having my ovaries removed because I have always been ER+ and about getting a Bio done even after Chemo to make sure nothing has changed.  Onc agreed to both. The radiologist that did the CT directed Bio was surprised that I was even having it done because I had already had Chemo but I told him that I requested one.  He said that my Onc is one of the best in the Tri-state and would not have given me Chemo if he didn't already know what my receptors were, so how could he have known without a biopsy? I had bloodtests and Pet Scans only this go around, or was he basing it off of the first two were both ER+, or is he just that D___ good? With all that I have been through by my own request in the last week, maybe I should just go by what he says.  He seems to keep me out of more pain than I do!",

I will have a PET scan next week and I really want to see what it looks like.  My nurse always lets me look at it after she gets done with the scan.  I am praying it is very little or better yet gone. My Onc doesn't want to say what kind of treatment we will do until after he gets the results of the scan. But I am happy to say that this Chemo worked well for me!

Good luck and I hope it works well for you too! Edited to say it does cause Fatigue, but I think they all do.",

I did have to take a Neulasta shot with the chemo I received two years ago, and the pain with those shot made me feel like my bones would explode.  It could just be the combo you are on. You should probably ask your Onc what he can do to help. Sorry you are having such a hard time with the SE, I hope you find relief soon!",
