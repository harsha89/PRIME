What I'm still unsure about with regard to your tumor is whether or not it is a mixture of tubular and mucinous.  OR, is it a \"traditional\" IDC with some tubular and mucinous features.  If it is a traditional IDC, then when you look at the 2011 NCCN guidelines, you can follow the the treatment plan for traditional IDC's with your markers, rather than the guidelines for tubular and mucinous tumors that are outlined on another page. For mucinous breast cancers, the most important prognostic marker is whether or not the lymph nodes are involved.  For lymph node negative mucinous breast cancers, the prognosis is excellent.  Tubular also carries an excellent prognosis, even if there is lymph node involvement. Are your physicians aware of Dr. Perkins study?  Ask them!  Without a doubt, I think it is still worth investigating getting another MRI and certainly another ultrasound.  In my situation, when I had the ultrasound, the radiologist wanted to biopsy one suspicious \"cyst.\"  I chose to do the biopsy elsewhere and the SECOND radiologist chose NOT to biopsy THAT \"cyst,\" but yet ANOTHER \"cyst\" which ultimately proved to be a mucinous tumor.  It wasn't until I had the MRI that the DCIS was found.  I too, have very dense and very cystic breasts which are a nightmare for my doctors. So.... what do I recommend you do come Monday morning? Ask your doctors if they are familiar with Dr. Perkins' study.  Ask them if they are confident with radiology reports.  By all means, if there are any lingering questions, then follow up BEFORE surgery with the necessary tests.  Once you have all the tests in place, then proceed with surgery.  The final surgical biopsy report will dictate treatment plan.  In the meantime, check out the NCCN guidelines. How are other women doing?  If you do a search here on the board, you will see that there have been a select number of women with mucinous tumors.  One gal popped on to say she had one 20 something years ago and has gone on to raise a family.  What surprises me is that mucinous breast cancers are usually found in older women.  Instead, I've found here that a handful of women in their 30s, 40s and early 50s, like myself, who are premenopausal have gotten it. If you find out after surgery that you still have a Grade 1, low Oncotype DX score and NO node involvement, then you will fit the profile for an \"excellent\" prognosis.  But like my medical oncologist said to me, sending me to a dark place in my mind, \"With breast cancer...you never know.\"  I just want to close by saying, even if it's a Grade 2 or 3 or is HER2+ you still may have very good prognosis because of the amazing treatments now available. Good luck.  My prayers and good thoughts are with you.",

Fourteen months postoperatively, she remains well without evidence of tumor recurrence. Although several reports have suggested that pure mucinous carcinoma of the breast has a favorable prognosis, we need to follow this case until the clinical behavior and the outcome become clear.",

With the development of the Oncotype DX test, women's tumors were classified into three categories. If a woman had a low Oncotype DX score, she would receive little benefit from chemo.  Whereas, those with an intermediate score, the test still hasn't determined how much benefit they would receive and for that reason the TailorX test is in the works to find out.  Then you have a group of women, who receive high scores and, without a doubt, benefit from chemo. Recently, it was determined that based on the Oncotype DX test, close to 30% of treatment recommendations were changed due to the results of the test. Oncotype DX Influences Breast Cancer Treatment Decisions The Oncotype DX® breast cancer test may change treatment decisions for more than a third of women with early, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. These results were presented at the 2010 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. The Oncotype DX breast cancer test measures the expression of 21 genes in a sample of tumor tissue. The test generates a Recurrence Score® that provides information about the likelihood of cancer recurrence and the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit in women with early-stage, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Previous studies have indicated that use of the Oncotype DX breast cancer test can influence breast cancer treatment decisions. Test results may, for example, change the treatment recommendation from chemotherapy plus hormonal therapy to hormonal therapy alone (or vice versa). To provide additional information about the impact of Oncotype DX on breast cancer treatment decisions, researchers combined information from seven studies that enrolled a total of 912 patients.[1] These results provide additional evidence that Oncotype DX can play an important role in treatment decisions for early breast cancer. In another study presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, researchers evaluated a combination of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score and factors such as tumor size and tumor grade.[2] The combined score did not predict chemotherapy benefit as well as the Recurrence Score alone.

Presented at the 33rd annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, December 8-12, 2010. Abstract S4 Secondly, the Oncotype DX test has been shown to classify tumors using different criteria than the traditional staging and can be used as one more tool to make a treatment decision.  For example, you might see, from time to time women saying that they had a \"Grade 1\" tumor with an intermediate or high Oncotype score and ask whether others had the same situation and they want to know what were their treatment decisions.  Likewise, there have been women with \"Grade 3\" tumors with low scores.  So it is EXTREMELY VALUABLE to have a Oncotype DX test done, especially with a Grade 1 tumor...because you might be missing an aggressive tumor that requires chemo. Another important piece of information derived from the Oncotype DX test is that some women find out that they have REALLY low scores...which means that if they had a score of 2,3 or 4, for example...their risk of recurrence might only be 3 or 4% WITH Tamoxifen.  So in that situation, perhaps the risks outweigh the benefits.  BUT, a woman may still be encouraged to take it to decrease her risk of another primary tumor as well. Finally, the Oncotype DX score assumes you are taking Tamoxifen.  So if you receive a score of 15...that means you have a 10% chance of distant recurrence if you take Tamoxifen.  If you do not take Tamoxifen then your risk of recurrence increases by almost 50%..so that would be a 15% chance of distant recurrence.  They say that with an AI, you can decrease your risk by 1 or 2% over the Tamoxifen number...but that hasn't been clinically proven yet.",

In particular, there has been a trend away from using whole-breast irradiation in these patients, so some patients receive no radiation at all, whereas others are treated with partial breast irradiation, he explained. \"Our study shows that that about one third of these women have more than a solitary lesion. This disease may be more multicentric than previously thought, and this is the first time that this has been reported,\" he said. These new findings suggest that undertreatment may be a \"significant hazard for patients,\" he added. It is important that the pendulum does not swing too far. \"You have to be very careful about offering no treatment or minimized treatment,\" he said. \"In an era where there is a concern about overtreatment, it is important that the pendulum does not swing too far so that we are undertreating.\" Claudine Issacs, MD, director of the Clinical Breast Cancer Program at the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center in Washington, DC, who moderated a press conference at which the findings were highlighted, added: \"Partial-breast irradiation is an investigational treatment and should not be offered as a standard of care.\" Large Series of Rare Tumor Type Mucinous tumors are diagnosed in about 2% of all breast cancer patients, but they are more common in older women. This subtype is found in about 8% to 10% of women 70 or years or older, but in fewer than 0.5% of those 35 years or younger. The M.D. Anderson team reviewed the charts of 264 patients diagnosed with a pure mucinous carcinoma from 1965 to 2005; the median age was 57 years, and median follow-up was 14 years. \"This is one of the largest single-institution experiences with a relatively uncommon subtype, and it has a significant long-term follow-up of patients,\" Dr. Perkins said. The favorable prognosis is apparent from the long-term follow-up, as shown in the table below. Outcome After Long-Term Follow-Up On initial examination, only 10% of these women had a multicentric/multifocal presentation. However, a detailed pathology review revealed a 38% rate of multicentric/multifocal disease after resection, which surprised the team, Dr. Perkins explained. \"We had previously been surprised by the decreasing age at presentation in this population, and by the regression of favorable outcomes toward the lower outcomes of other common breast cancer subtypes over time,\" he explained in a statement. \"This reinforces our commitment to interdisciplinary care and true personalized patient treatment in this variant,\" he said. There needs to be a move away from \"the assumption that it may not matter which treatment approach is taken because this is a favorable disease,\" he added. 32nd Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS): Abstract 4117.

Mucinous Carcinoma of the breast So glad I found this discussion group.  It is difficult to find information about mucinous breast cancer.  I have been dealing with this for eight years and am Stage IV Grade 3.  First of all, it is apparent to me that the young ages of the women posting here is significant and the latest news about the difficulty in diagnosing from mammograms is not a surprise to me.  I had been religious in having a mammogram done yearly and never had a doubt all was well.  By the time it broke through the fat pad, it was 5 cm.  Although everyone claims it was slow growing, I believe that the tumor grew rapidly after diagnosis.  It required a mastectomy and there was extensive lymph node involvement on the left side.  Chemo, Rad., Taxol, and I was back in business thinking this is what was needed to repair the damage of the cancer.  About a year later, I had reconstruction on the breast and started to feel good about myself.  Within seven months, I had a recurrence on my right side based on a suspicious lymph node in a CT scan.  Onc and surgeon felt there would be no problem, but we decided a surgical biopsy just in case.  Went to sleep and woke up hearing a nurse talk about getting a bed for me.  Huh? I said, \"Why do I need a bed?\"  The right side was loaded with involvement of cancer in the lymph system.  More chemo and radiation at the same time.  SEs were very bad and I ended up with a frozen shoulder in the process and serious lymphedema as well.  I have since had two small contained recurrences in the reconstructed left breast which the surgeon removed easily.  Right now, I have gone 3-1/2 years without a recurrence, which is pretty good.  I am on Herceptin, once every three weeks and Femara once a day to try to keep this in check.  So far...So good!  I am not trying to pop anyone's balloon, but be vigilant.  ",

At 53, I was premenopausal at diagnosis and agreed to Lupron injections for two years. These last few months my menopausal status is being checked and I appear to be menopausal. I too, worry about the abrupt depletion of estrogen since heart disease runs rampant in my family. Since I menstruated longer than most women, the decision to do ovarian suppression was a little easier for me. I wonder at age 48 now, based on your family history, at what age would you normally approach menopause? Perhaps your body at 48 is closer to menopause and a few months or a year of O/S might not be as much of a further cardiac risk, since you already had an estrogen loss from your previous chemo. Furthermore, everyone varies when it comes to menopause symptoms. What's not to say that you are feeling well now with your regular periods and in a year, as you approach natural menopause, you feel awful again. Likewise, you might surprise yourself and move smoothly into menopause! Deciding whether to do O/S is not an easy one. But with two premenopausal breast cancer diagnoses, I would carefully review my risks vs. benefits of treatment while considering quality of life. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Feb 19, 2013 12:11PM - edited Feb 19, 2013 12:12PM by voraciousreader Here's what Lillie Shockney has to say about this study over at Johns Hopkins Ask An Expert website.  On 2/14/2013 under the topic of Facts and Myths about Breast Cancer, a person asked, \"I just read a Duke University study that says women who choose lumpectomy + radiation (for early stage) have a better survival than those who choose mastectomy for early stage breast cancers.  They said it was an observational study, but important.  I always thought they were both pretty much equal, but 13% in favor of lumpectomy seems high.\" Shockney's reply was, \"Yes. it is a new study but not one that has not resulted in a change in the standards of care at this point.  Other studies need to happen to validate this one study before people start to give thought to whether it is valuable enough and statistically significant enough to consider it scientifically proven to the point that standards in practice need to change.\" __________________________________________________________________ Selena....regarding your point that this study underscores the mistaken impression that mastectomy is superior is appreciated.  I think perhaps the reason why the observational study was conducted was that clinicians saw a worrisome uptick in the number of mastectomies and bi-laterial mastectomies for patients  who were given a choice, when they could have had a lumpectomy with radiation instead.  I think they expected to show that when given a choice between mastectomy and lumpectomy with radiation, patients can feel confident in choosing the lumpectomy.  As Lillie Shockney stated, there still needs to be more studies done to prove if there is a statistically significant difference. When I read the journal article, I was reminded about the uptick in the number of C-sections.  Today I read that twins can be safely delivered vaginally and that a planned C-section is NO better than a planned vaginal delivery. http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/SMFM/37368 I really am left wondering with all these studies how physicians are able to translate all of information to patients so they can make an informed decision....I wonder whether physicians have biases  and let those biases get in the way of helping patients make the \"best\" decision possible.  Likewise, I think patients need to be pro-active in accumulating the most up-to-date information.  None of us can kick ourselves for making the \"wrong\" decision, if we find out later in time that one treatment plan favors another.  I welcome the results of the SOFT and TAILORX trials.  Clearly, when I had to make a decision, since those trials had not yet been completed, I could NOT depend on the information from those trials.  When their data comes to fruition, am I going to have regrets?  No.  Because I believe I made the best decisions based on the best available information that was given to me at the time of my diagnosis. Looking back, I now realize how much valuable information I was given by my team. What I think the takeaway message from this study was, is plain and simple.  If patients are given a CHOICE about whether to receive a lumpectomy or mastectomy, they can be comfortable choosing lumpectomy.  That's all we know now and that's no different from what we knew decades ago when lumpectomy with radiation became part of the standard of care.  And until another study is done, as Shockney explained, the standard of care remains unchanged.  A woman should feel comfortable with either procedure.",

One group of researchers at Sloan Kettering have identified a marker which can identify a progression of metatastic disease before imaging or symptoms identifies it. This info is EXTREMELY important for patients and clinicians because treatment could be changed more quickly.   With respect to the other 7% ....keep in mind... If you look at insurance charts, as we age, our percentage of dying from other causes goes up as well. So while you may have a 7% of dying in the next 5-10 years of breast cancer, you might have an overall greater chance of dying from something else. The only thing I think these statistics are good for is to make treatment decisions. Hence, deciding how aggressive one needs to be with treatment. One day soon, those statistics will become moot because genomic identification will usurp statistics. That is, once you are diagnosed, using genetic info, you will know how responsive treatment will be for your type of cancer.",

Today, targeted therapies are available based on the results of blood tests. Herceptin, a targeted therapy has been a game changer in fighting breast cancer. A big change during the last decade and what is driving treatment decisions are tests like the OncotypeDX test. Two decades ago, oncologists knew they were overtreating patients. Now, many patients can forgo chemo thanks to the OncotypeDX score.  The biggest advance that is on the horizon is what Eric Topol, MD refers to in his book, The Creative Destruction of Medicine. That is, clinical trials will be and ARE being based on more \"onomics.\" No longer will patients and their clinicians have to figure out how a clinical trial relates to individuals because the trials are based on large sample populations. Instead, cinical trials will be and some currently are so individual based that data can and is being evaluated more quickly. No need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on trials lasting a decade or more.  And my example of dermatology, it merely is one example of how medicine works. Kayb does a great job of explaining the science behind how medical treatments are decided. Simplifying how oncology vs dermatology decisions differ is not the point. Instead, the point is that medical decisions are based on evidence based medicine and ethics. Most people would not want a treatment that might be unnecessary and come with long term side effects. I know I would want my clinician to give me the best treatment they deem necessary for ME. Each day, clinicians with the help of researchers are doing a better job at giving us more personalized medicine.  You and/or clinician may believe that the medical community doesn't know yet how to synthesize the data into realtime treatment decisions. IMHO, I have already seen at Sloan Kettering how a liquid biopsy pinpointed a metastatic progression before a patient became symptomatic and well before imaging identified the progression. The clinicians were able to change the patient's treatment and her survival has been extended. That progress is happening NOW. We deserve better and are receiving it.  ",

Dr Swain: One of the more interesting concepts, and one that is getting a lot of attention, is looking at the circulating DNA and doing what we call liquid biopsies. There are noninvasive blood tests that detect circulating tumor cells and fragments of tumor DNA that are shed into the blood from the primary tumor and from metastatic sites.[15] They can be used for diagnosis, response to treatment, and prognosis and are much easier for the patient than having to undergo repeated scans or invasive tissue biopsies. In the future, liquid biopsies could be very useful in monitoring tumor changes in real time and could help guide cancer treatment decisions. In metastatic disease, we do recommend that biopsies be done more frequently because the tumor can change, and that's where the liquid biopsy may be more helpful. A patient's tumor can have a change in the mutation, for example. It can sometimes be very difficult or impossible to do a biopsy at some sites, such as if the cancer has metastasized to the bone.\"  Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx........

It is far from junk science. And you know what is amazing? Now, more than ever before, records are digitalized. This gives researchers opportunities to glean patterns earlier than what we were capable of doing years before. Thanks to genomics, we are also getting better at screening for disease and when disease strikes, giving us better treatments and treatment options, One day soon we won\u2019t need to screen entire groups and we will be able to move some of thise screening dollars into research and finding treatments and cures.  For sure, breast cancer affects more older women. The risk of getting breast cancer is greatest between 50-75. With American women living well into their 80\u2019s, it gives researchers lots of time to see whether women are getting breast cancer and are dying from the disease or dying from something else. Researchers are also getting autopsy data that unveils those people who died from something else and yet had been living with an undiagnosed breast cancer.  Finally, to answer your question of how would we know if a person was cured of cancer if they died from something else decades later, that speaks to the belief among researchers that for so many women, breast cancer has become a very treatable disease, Cure? Maybe not. But good enough for most. And researchers know that thanks to the Scientific Method, Statistics and Computer Technology.

That point speaks to what Traveltext said....the evidence is \u201c2B\u201d according to the heirarchy of evidence. Over decades, evidence accumulates for the various cancers and, as the \u201cexperts\u201d meet annually, they look at the evidence and then debate the merits and develop new guidelines as the evidence changes. Since I was diagnosed 8 years ago, I have seen some changes recommended for tubular and mucinous breast cancers. I have also seen changes, in my opinion remarkable, for other types as well. For example, back in 2011 they began recommending the OncotypeDX test for those patients with ER + HER2- disease.  So, That\u2019s why I think trust in your team is paramount. They are the ones who have the years of experience and are able to see the evolution of the guidelines. Years after my primary treatment ended, I realized how spot on my team was with their recommendations. Now, as I move closer to my 10th year of treatment, both my MO and I continue to stay current with all of the latest studies and discuss how they affect me. Several years ago i mentioned that I was reading up on the BCI genetic test and my MO said at the time he wasn\u2019t ready to recommend the test. Then, a year ago, he finally recommended it and I did the test. Now, to answer the question of why someone would want to trust prognostics twenty years ahead? Well the answer lies with those sisters who were diagnosed with BC more than 50 years ago. As we move forward, we are able to look back at those patients who were treated 50 years ago and we can look at their outcomes. That partially explains how the OncotypeDX test was developed. Moving more closer in time we see how newer treatments have and still are affecting patients.  Is all of this research junk science? As one who has finished active treatment and now sits in the bleechers and watchs the research evolve, I most humbley and respectfully disagree. With each passing year I grow more confident in the decisions I made AND I grow more confident with the research devoted to breast cancer prognostics",

Until some better form of science comes along and we can dismiss the Scientific Method and statistics, I will just have to stick with the status quo...  Lastly....if you think your team was inept, why didn\u2019t you seek out better care? Before being treated, I consulted the NCCN breast cancer treatment guidelines. Did your team\u2019s treatment plan differ from the Standard of Care? What was the level of evidence that determined your treatment? No doubt there are some patients that were not offered the standard of care....but then there are some who are and yet refuse. Are the breast cancer treatment guidelines, which there are a few, just bewildering to the point where you don\u2019t trust them? I am just trying to understand why you would be so dismissive of the statistics....I know from time to time the cancer researchers and clinicians will vehemently disagree with one another, eg DCIS treatment, population based screening, just to name a few....and these controversies continue unabatted....BUT....at least the players in these controversies are doing their best at trying to settle the controversies by conducting more research and in time, someone will be proven correct. My team was able to tell me what they knew (guidelines) and what they didn\u2019t know ( clinical trials). From that, AND their experience, I made as best of an informed decision as I could. If I am alive in 30 years, perhaps the decision I made will be helpful to some future patients and clinicia",

A week ago, some one also posted that they had an Oncotype DX failure.  I guess, we've become accustomed to the Oncotype DX test, that until recently, many of us never realized that there could be \"failures.\"  Hopefully, they will get enough of a sample this time to complete the test. There are many things to consider.   Back in the day, before the Oncotype DX test, women had to make choices about chemo without this important information.  What did they do?  I think at the end of the day, you have to put your fate in the hands of the oncologist whom you trust the most and follow their recommendation.  Since both oncologists are on the fence...why not consider a third opinion?  Have you gone to a comprehensive cancer center?  A teaching hospital?  I received three opinions.  Thankfully, they were all in agreement.  Your mother also has to decide how much risk she wishes to take.  Like you said, it's grade 3, but small.  Some women will want to do chemo despite the risks, while others, may not.  Also, her age is important and her health status. While you're waiting for the results, why not look at the 2011 NCCN guidelines for some direction. Good luck and my prayers and thoughts are with both of you, and of course, all my breast cancer sisters. Sorry, I can't be of more help.",

Don't let that Oncotype Score haunt you!  For all of us, whether our scores are high or low there is always the chance of recurrence. Even if you have the lowest of low score, if you do get a recurrence then what matter is it that you had a low number?  Remember, the score is also used to determine if chemo would be of benefit.  The test was designed to determine who should receive chemo and who shouldn't.  For years, doctors knew that many women were being overtreated with chemo.  The Oncotype DX test is merely one more tool to be used in making the decision whether or not chemo would be beneficial. Also, there is a lot of controversy about using those cancer blood test markers for Stage 1. You've done all you can.  Wear your seat belt and get on with enjoying life!

The good nurse, described in the book that I mentioned earlier, was committing murder for more than a decade.  He moved from hospital to hospital without ANY employment issues.  Human resources at several hospitals NEVER uncovered his dubious employment record!  It took another nurse to figure out what he was doing and ultimately called the police!  Something that numerous previous employers should have done. Our society is filled with rotten apples.  Philosophers, over the ages, have tried to figure out what makes people good or bad...and in between.  We all need to ask ourselves at what point would we be inclined to blow a whistle?  And once we do blow it, if the response isn't favorable, would we still blow the whistle again and again until justice is properly served.....",

With an Oncotype DX score of 11, you will NOT reduce your chance of recurrence by 4%. Keep in mind the risks of chemo could also diminish your quality of life and mortality. In fact, if you read the fine print of the Oncotype DX test scores, the patients, on average, who had Oncotype DX scores lower than 18 and only did Tamoxifen, had better 10 year survivals (96.8%) than those who had scores lower than 18 and did both Tamoxifen and chemo (95.6%). That said, the Oncotype DX is just one piece of many pieces of info used to help make the decision.",

First off, until you have surgery,your stage is tentative. Once you have surgery and have a final pathology report, then you will know your stage. That's why there are \"X\" s on your biopsy report. If your cancer is non invasive.. You would tentative be staged at Stage 0. That said, you can have either non invasive cancer, invasive cancer or both. If the doctor said your biopsy found invasive cells, you would no longer be staged at Stage 0.  What will ultimately drive your treatment is the specific characteristics of your tumor....Register at the NCCN's website and read about the breast cancer treatment guidelines.  Hang in there! Until you have a treatment plan in place, you will be very anxious. That is normal. That said, call your doctor's office and ask to speak with someone so you get answers to all your questions.

According to the information that you provided, you do indeed have excellent prognostics.  Furthermore, at your young age it was a great idea for your doctor to do the Oncotype DX test.  I would also recommend because you are young that you also receive BRCA genetic testing if it hasn't been recommended already.  Most young women, those under 45, who have a breast cancer diagnosis are usually screened for it. While you wait for more information regarding your treatment plan, I highly recommend that you go to the NCCN website and read the Professionals version of the guidelines for breast cancer.  You will note that you have MANY choices.

I've noticed truck food is becoming popular in other parts of the country.  I recently visited my younger son in Austin, Texas and noticed that one truck in a popular lot was serving rabbit and/or rattle snake on a bun.  I hear it is very popular and also delicious! Oh...and I agree with Caryn...that Bialy would NOT pass muster in my neck of the woods.... Oh, and sicilian slices are EVERYWHERE in New York!  Just remember to eat it WITHOUT a fork!",

In Eric Topol, MD's terrific book, The Creative Destruction of Medicine, he describes a day where clinical trials of this magnitude will be unnecessary.  He describes clinical trials based solely on genomics that will be able to pinpoint whether a treatment is right for someone.   This study illustrates EXACTLY what he's describing.  When I looked at the press release, I wondered, how young were these patients in the study for them to be taking Tamoxifen for 10 years.  How many of them had chemo before taking the Tamoxifen?  What stage and grade were they?  What Dr. Topol argues in his book is that using genomics in the future might be an easier way to identify patients' uniqueness and then it might be easier to choose a treatment. With the information you have, you have MANY choices.  You also don't mention whether or not you are pre or post menopausal.  If you are pre-menopausal, you might consider ovarian suppression rather than chemotherapy.  There are two trials underway looking at whether or not these treatments are beneficial.  The SOFT and TEXT trials.  Likewise, if you DO decide to do ovarian suppression and are close to menopause and are doing ovarian suppression, there is another study involving Zometa, a bone building drug that is also showing promising results at preventing recurrence.  Furthermore, diet and exercise are being studied carefully as well to measure how well they keep recurrences at bay. You have MANY choices and an excellent prognosis!  Good luck!",

Lily...This study was not done to illicit fear in those who chose mastectomy over lumpectomy with radiation.  As Beesie mentioned, some patients are not given a choice and can only have a mastectomy.  You need to put this study into the context in which it was conducted.  Recall that a generation ago, women had NO choice and mastectomy was a given for anyone who was diagnosed with breast cancer.  With the help of brave researchers, physicians and PATIENTS, a clinical trial was conducted to determine if a lumpectomy  was an option and, as you know, ultimately, lumpectomy became an option for many patients. As you probably know, today, many patients choose mastectomy over lumpectomy with radiation because they are fearful of radiation which is USUALLY given with the lumpectomy. Furthermore, he media has been reporting that during the last decade, the number of mastectomies and bilateral mastectomies are increasing. Physicians were puzzled by this uptick in the number of mastectomies.  This study was conducted mostly for the purpose of finding out whether or not lumpectomy with radiation is an acceptable option.  What this retrospective study concludes and what many physicians believe is that when given a choice between lumpectomy with radiation vs. mastectomy, a patient can be confident that it is \"okay\" to have the lumpectomy with radiation.  Also remember, there are many caveats to the study AND the media did a terrible job, as usual of \"spinning\" this story.  The headline should have been something like \"Lumpectomy with Radiation is a Safe Choice for Those Given an Option.\"  And then the story should have gone on to discuss the uptick in mastectomies and put the controversy into perspective. I wish you well.",

Sub-category:ER+ Category:Breast Cancer - HER2/ER Meeting:2011 ASCO Annual Meeting Session Type and Session Title:This abstract will not be presented at the 2011 ASCO Annual Meeting but has been published in conjunction with the meeting. Abstract No:e11055 Citation:J Clin Oncol 29: 2011 (suppl; abstr e11055) Author(s):S. Sahebjam, R. Aloyz, D. Pilavdzic, M. Brisson, C. Ferrario, N. Bouganim, V. Cohen, W. H. Miller Jr., L. C. Panasci Abstract: Background: Most newly diagnosed patients with invasive breast cancer have node negative disease. A key question in management of these patients is the risk/benefit ratio of adjuvant chemotherapy. Several microarray tests have been developed and are currently used to help identifying the patients who will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Ki 67 proliferation index is less expensive and has been used as a prognostic and predictive factor in node positive breast cancer and neoadjuvant setting. Methods: Forty five cases of T1-2 N0 M0 (ER positive, HER2/neu negative) breast cancer were reviewed. Oncotype Dx results were available for all patients. Tumor specimens were stained for Ki 67. Results: The median of Ki 67 index was 17 (range 2-90). The median Oncotype recurrence score was 17 (range 7-60). There was a strong linear correlation between Ki67 index and Oncotype recurrence score (correlation coefficient= 0.74, P value= 0.000). This correlation was stronger in tumors with Ki 67 proliferation index of ≥ 25. Patients were divided to low risk, intermediate risk and high risk group based on expression of Ki 67. All patients in low Ki 67 group (Ki 67 of ≤ 10) had recurrence score of low or intermediate. Most patients (92%) in high Ki 67 group (Ki 67 ≥ 25) had oncotype recurrence score of high or intermediate. Furthermore, neither semi-quantitative immunohistologic expression of ER and HER2, nor nuclear grade had a significant impact on the correlation between Ki67 index and Oncotype recurrence score. Conclusions: Ki 67 proliferation index is a major but not the sole determinant of Oncotype Dx score. Immunologic expression of ER and HER-2 do not significantly impact this correlation. Ki 67 proliferation index can be used to identify patients with a high probability of having increased Oncotype Dx score and requiring adjuvant chemotherapy.",

Also be aware of studies that discuss disease free survival and overall mortality. Look up the meanings of those terms. They will help you understand what is being measured. The OncotypeDX score gives you two pieces of info. Whether chemo's benefits will outweigh your risks and your chance of metastasis within 10 years. Again, your score assumes you are taking Tamoxifen. I cannot tell you what I would do if iwere in your shoes. I exercise and am NOT overweight, eat properly and still got cancer. Don't think there would be much more that I could do to lower my risk without taking Tamoxifen. Now regarding your family history of uterine cancer...if you decide to try Tamoxifen, I would recommend that you get a baseline transvaginal ultrasound. I had gyno issues before I began my journey and continue to have issues...my gyno and MO work very closely together. I would think your doctors would do the same. I wish you well with your decision. And remember one thing...nothing is written in stone with respect to your treatment plan. I think you can revisit your decisions whenever you want to. I recommend finding an MO whose opinion you respect and then together decide!",

Are you pre or post menopausal?  The Standard of Care according to the NCCN breast cancer treatment guidelines is for premenopausal women to begin using Tamoxifen and postmenopausal women usually begin with an aromatase inhibitor (AI).  The study that you site, appears in detail in the 2013 NCCN breast cancer treatment guidelines (professional version...NOT PATIENT version) beginning on Page 97 under the heading Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy.  You can register at the NCCN website and read the details.  Basically what the studies tell us is that if you are diagnosed while you are premenopausal, the Standard of Care is 5 years of Tamoxifen, that is unless you become postmenopausal at some point and then you can take an AI.  That ASSUMES that you have a tumor that is larger than .5 cm.  As I said earlier, if your tumor is smaller than .5 cm, then the NCCN guidelines tells us that you should \"consider\" taking endocrine therapy. If you begin your journey and are already postmenopausal, then the NCCN guidelines recommend 5 years of an AI...OR begin with two to three years of Tamoxifen and follow it with two to three years of an AI. With the newly released Atlas study based on premenopausal patients, the study concluded that premenopausal women could now have a CHOICE of taking Tamoxifen for 10 years.  This study has NOT yet been incorporated into the NCCN guidelines.  However, this was welcoming news to premenopausal women who had aggressive ER positive tumors.  It gives patients AN OPTION to CONTINUE THERAPY. Now regarding the study that you posted, which goes into greater detail in the NCCN guidelines, there are STILL ONGOING TRIALS to see if patients should be in AI's longer.  There's also ongoing trials of 5 years of Tamoxifen followed by 5 years of an AI AND there are all kinds of trials with all kinds of sequencing combinations of Tamoxifen and AIs.  None of the trials, EXCEPT the ATLAS trial have been disclosed.  Perhaps at the next San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium held in December will give us more information.  Now regarding vascular invasion and Genomics Health....I hope you now have a better understanding about how the recurrence score is determined.  Now I know Genomics Health is doing a study on node positive patients and the OncotypeDX score, but I never heard of anything with respect to vascular invasion.  The OncotypeDX test is a genetic marker test.  And while the KI-67 score is factored into the test, Genomics Health DOES NOT BREAK OUT THAT SCORE.  There has been a lot of discussion on this board about the accuracy of the KI-67 test.  And while some patients want to know their KI-67 score, for most patients it isn't that important....especially when they have a low OncotypeDX score and \"favorable\" other tumor characteristics.  Perhaps if you were on the cusp of having a higher score that indicated that you might need chemo, then the score might be a reasonable thing to investigate.  However, my physician made it clear to me that the KI-67 was the \"poor man's\" OncotypeDX score.  With such favorable prognostics, do you really need to know that information? Before your MO appointment, may I suggest you read the NCCN guidelines...including the footnotes.  There's a wealth of information found in the guidelines.  Likewise, there is more information that many of us would like to have that is still unknown...such as how important is ovarian suppression for premenopausal women?  We won't have the answer to that question either for a while.  But it is encouraging to know that the SOFT and TEXT trials that are examining that question have accrued enough patients so that when the trials are completed, we will have statistically significant information. Good luck.",

I'm going to let you and mepic know why I'm such a voracious reader...scouring all the data and trying to make heads or tails out of it.  It began with the DH's journey.  When he was diagnosed, almost twenty years ago, with his rare genetic metabolic muscular dystrophy, there were fewer than 500 people in the world known to have the disorder.  So, for the last twenty years, I've spent a considerable amount of time reading EVERYTHING I can about rare metabolic muscular dystrophies looking for a treatment for him.  That experience prepared me for my own experience being diagnosed with a RARE breast cancer.  I kinda laughed when they told me mucinous breast cancer was \"rare.\"  Seemed pretty common to me compared to the DH's disorder.  So, between the two disorders, I became voracious at reading EVERYTHING.  Thankfully, I was blessed with taking a statistics course in college and was able to decipher what I was reading.... Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting at Sloan Kettering researchers who study rare breast cancers.  I informed them of a study that they somehow missed on pubmed.  Pubmed is a government clearinghouse of ALL clinical trials.  It's the go to place to read EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING medical.  When I showed them the study, I told them when I have down time, I don't bother with Facebook, instead I turn to pubmed.  They all chuckled and said that they did the same thing! ____________________________________________________________________ Now mepic....That 8.3 Estrogen score that appears on your OncotypeDX score is NOT low.  It isn't even slightly low.  It is a good score.  It tells you that endocrine therapy should work for you if you choose to do it.  If you had a score on the cusp of 6.5, then THAT would be a low score.  The 8.3 Estrogen score is validating your respectable OncotypeDX score of 15.",

The bottom line for MOST patients presented with \"favorable\" prognostics is that you will eventually die from something else.  For some, breast cancer is deadly.  But what's lost in the Pink Ribbon campaign is that it is more likely for us to die from something else.  Heart disease claims way more lives.  Obesity.  Hypertension. Diabetes. Car accidents.  And not to really sound too macabre and like a real psycho Debbie Downer, pregnancy also kills....but who stops to think about having a baby?  Regarding pregnancy \"killing\"....I'm not referring to maternal illnesses during pregnancy which can also lead to death.  I'm referring to the little known fact that a woman is most vulnerable to being murdered WHILE SHE IS PREGNANT...by the hands of the man who helped impregnate her!  I could go on and on and on about all the things other than breast cancer that can kill you that could mentally paralysize one from physicially walking out of the house!  OR, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO BELIEVE THAT YOUR BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS IS A BUMP ON THE PATH ON YOUR JOURNEY TO A LONG LIFE.",

      "Content": "Jul 20, 2014 07:47AM - edited Jul 20, 2014 07:49AM by voraciousreader Mom.....First off, if your case hasn't already been assessed by a tumor board, I think it is wise to do so.  I realize you had a tough go of the chemo and are still unsure of how to proceed.  Let's review some of the basics and how they apply to you. First off, you mention from biopsy to surgical pathology report you went from Grade 1 to Grade 3.  Now, putting aside pathologist subjectiveness, you need to ignore the biopsy report.  Why?  Because a tumor is NOT homogeneous! It is possible that the tumor cells taken during biopsy from the actual tumor were the less aggressive cells.  My surgeon told me that it is the surgical pathology report that drives treatment.  So, for all intents and purposes your tumor is Grade 3. Now, with respect to the study I posted 4 years ago.....YOU....my dear fellow sister are also a voracious reader.  That's great!  However, here is the problem.....you are taking the study out of context.😮 Let me give you some contest so you can understand the meaningfulness of that study and how it affects you. Before the OncotypeDX test was developed, medical oncologists depended on subjective pathology reports to dictate active treatment plans.  What this study tells us, published in 2008, shortly after the test was approved, is there is no way to predict what an OncotypeDX score would be based on the pathology report.  However, in the small sample, it was found that there was no two-step differences between grade and OncotypeDX score.  We do know since the small study was published that occasionally there have been outliers, that is Grade 1 tumors with high OncotypeDX scores, but for the most part, a Grade 1tumor will either have a low or intermediate score AND a Grade 3 tumor will have either an intermediate or high score.  So, you have a Grade 3 tumor, based on the more accurate SURGICAL report and dreaded intermediate score.  And your doctor is correct.  We will not know until next year when preliminary results of TailorX are unveiled what treatment works best for intermediate OncotypeDX score patients.  Actually, it might even take longer than next year to find out because survival data takes a very long time to accrue because ER fueled tumors take longer to recur than other breast cancers. And, let's not try to get into a whole discussion about KI-67 scores.  Yes, they are included in the OncotypeDX score, but their absolute meaningfulness taken alone is quite debatable. The takeaway is that all of the info gathered about the tumor, added to a patient's other risk factors help the physician and patient design a treatment plan.  Side effects and quality of life should always be factored into the equation on an on going basis. So Mom....I think you need to decide based on an intermediate score along with a Grade 3 tumor what is right for you.  I wish you well!  ",

Keep in mind, the Oncotype DX score is merely one measure in determining if the benefits of chemo outweigh the risks. Your age, size of tumor, general health must also be considered.  While you are in research mode, register at the NCCN web bsite and read the professional version ( red logo) of the 2014 breast cancer treatment guidelines.  Good luck!",

First, gather as much information regarding doing chemo with your oncotype score.  Currently, there is the TAILOR study being conducted to see whether or not women in the OncotypeDX \"intermediate\" risk  score, which you have, will benefit from chemotherapy.  Unfortunately, the results of that test will not be known for several years.  You can do another breastcancer.org \"search\" on the word \"oncotype\" and see numerous threads from women asking the same question and the answers they received.  There's also an \"oncotypedx roll call\" which tells you what treatment plan women chose based on their scores. Regarding ovarian suppression, in addition to Tamoxifen, I mentioned to you on the other thread, there is the SOFT trial, which, again, unfortunately, is still underway.  So, at this moment in time there is no conclusive evidence to support its use. As you gather information, you should also look at the NCCN's guidelines for treatment.  You can google them as well. So where does that leave you and many other women?  Obviously, not in a comfortable place to make an informed decision.  However, and this is a big HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that you can't make an informed decision.  It just means that you have to gather as much information about your choices.  I would recommend that you see at least two medical oncologists and go over your treatment plans.  If they both agree and you feel comfortable, then that's terrific.  If they disagree, then make an appointment with a third doctor.  Then, choose a plan with the physician you felt most comfortable with and don't look back. Also, I think from reading what you have written, you think that you have to do EITHER chemo or ovarian suppression.  That's not the case with a number of women.  Many do both.  In fact, over at the Young Survival Coalition website, you will find that many young women with ER + breast cancers do BOTH. Regarding your question about being thrown into menopause, you will read that some women did quite well, while others didn't.  I chose chemical ovarian suppression because I wanted to see how I felt before committing to having my ovaries surgically removed.  I'm doing very well and have no side effects whatsoever.  But I'm also probably pretty close to the age that I would have gone into menopause anyway.  Good luck.",

It began with the selection of 250 candidate genes from the literature, as well as laboratory studies that test designers thought might be important for tamoxifen-treated women with breast cancer. Levels of mRNA for these genes were measured in 447 tumors from three studies of tamoxifen-alone adjuvant therapy\u2014including some women from the NSABP (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project) B20 trial where another group was randomized to tamoxifen plus chemotherapy\u2014to determine each gene\u2019s effect on distant relapse at 10 years from diagnosis. Based not only on the predictive power of each gene for distant relapse, but also on reproducibility in all three studies and also on consistency of primer and probe performance in the lab, 16 genes in five groups were selected for inclusion in the test and their expression compared with five reference genes that are not prognostic and do not figure into the final calculation except as reference points. This is really a 16-gene test and two of the genes included refer mainly to HER2-overexpressing tumors. Thus, for most of our patients, this is a 14-gene test. The observed mRNA levels are combined through a very complicated, weighted calculation into a single RS that ranges from 0 to 100. Blocks with interpretable mRNA levels were available for 668 tamoxifen-treated patients in NSABP B14 from the following two populations: 1,450 randomized to tamoxifen versus observation and another 1,235 assigned to tamoxifen without randomization. These patients were the basis of the first Oncotype DX paper.17 The initial argument was that the 93% DRFS of the low-risk patients was so high that adjuvant chemotherapy was unnecessary. Although the Oncotype DX RS was designed to be prognostic in a tamoxifen-treated population, the outcomes measured were determined both by the intrinsic characteristics of the tumor\u2014prognosis of untreated patients\u2014as well as by the ability of tamoxifen to improve or not to improve the outcomes. When the Oncotype DX RS was determined in NSABP B14 among node-negative women randomized to observation compared with those randomized to tamoxifen, these two effects could be separated (Table 3).\" Note the NSABP B14 trial....http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/search/view?cdrid=71311&version=HealthProfessional Furthermore, the OncotypeDX score ASSUMES you are taking Tamoxifen based on the B-20 results.  Now, I also had a recurrence score of 15.  The confidence interval for a score of 15 gives you a range of 7-12% with an average of 10% risk of recurrence, assuming you take Tamoxifen.  So the range of recurrence WITHOUT Tamoxifen is somewhere between 11 to approximately 18% if you DO NOT take Tamoxifen for 5 years.",

I hope at some point, some of what they say might resonate with you. I recall one post describing the difficulty of accepting situations that are out of our control. I recall another post where our sister described how she survived grueling chemotherapy and now still deals with each day a higher chance of the cancer returning than you who has excellent prognostics. No one is telling you how you should feel or behave. As I have said to you before, from what you write, I get the impression you are an intelligent and frightened AND now frustrated sister. I don't mind if you are angry at me for beating you over and over again with the suggestion of counseling. However, as I said earlier, if other sisters come along and read this \"open\" discussion and decide after reading this that they have reached the same crossroad as you, I want THEM to know that counseling IS an option that can ease their pain.",

And Lekker.... You are 100% correct that her thoughts regarding HER 2 positive patients does NOT belong here because this thread is devoted to KI and Oncotype.   As Beesie recently pointed out to the bco monitors on another thread, it just seems like it is getting harder and harder to get the bco mission across to newbies, when you have saavy members with questionable agendas thwarting other members' attempts to offer \"support.\"  I'm beginning to feel as exhausted as Beesie is!  It really pains me to have to be this critical of another member ... but for the sake of other newbies, she leaves me no other choice.",

The relationship of immunohistologically measured Ki 67 to Oncotype DX recurrence score (RS) was examined in 53 cases of T1\u20132 N0 M0 (oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative) breast cancer.  There was a strong linear correlation between Ki 67 value and the Oncotype Dx RS. All patients in the low Ki 67 group (Ki 67 of 10%) had Oncotype Dx RSs of low or intermediate risk. The vast majority of patients (93.8%) in the high-Ki 67 group (Ki 6725%) had oncotype RSs of high or intermediate risk.  Ki 67 proliferation value is a major, but not the sole determinant of Oncotype Dx score. Urruticoechea et al, 2005). Multiple studies have shown an association of Ki 67 expression with prognosis and response to systemic treatments in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. High-Ki 67 expression has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence and cancer death (Lee et al, 1997; Colleoni et al, 2004; Kronqvist et al, 2004; Penault-Llorca et al, 2009). Tumours with high Ki 67 before neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a higher rate of pathologic response, and lower Ki 67 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with favourable disease-free survival (DFS; Nishimura et al, 2010; Yerushalmi et al, 2010). At least two studies have suggested that patients with high-Ki 67 tumours may benefit more from adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy (Viale et al, 2008a,2008b; Penault-Llorca et al, 2009). The Oncotype Dx gene test (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA, USA) is a commercially available reverse transcriptase PCR assay (RT\u2013PCR) of 21 genes, which uses a specific algorithm to calculate the recurrence score (RS) for oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers. On the basis of RS, patients are considered low risk (RS<18), intermediate risk (18RS<31), or high risk (RS31). Although different cancer-related genes including ER and HER-2 expression are included in calculating the RS, five proliferation genes (Ki 67, STK 15, Survivin, CCNB 1, and MYBL 2) are heavily weighted and especially important in this calculation (Paik et al, 2004). This test is currently used for predicting the risk of recurrence in lymph node-negative ER-positive breast cancers, and is considered by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines as an option to help decision-making in this group of patients. Unfortunately, the high cost of this multigene assay limits its\u2019 use in daily practice in many countries. The aim of this study was to compare the correlation of immunohistologically measured Ki 67 protein expression with the Oncotype Dx RS in patients with lymph node-negative ER/progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, HER-2-negative breast cancers. Top of page With approval from the Institutional Research Ethics Committee, we analysed 53 cases of T1\u20132 N0 M0 (ER/PR-positive, HER-2-negative) breast cancer treated in the Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada. These cases were chosen randomly from a pool of patients with early-stage breast cancer, who had Oncotype Dx analysis of their tumour. Pathology reports were reviewed and histological type, tumour size, Nottingham grade, perineural invasion status, lymphovascular invasion status, invasive tumour necrosis, ER levels, and PR levels were recorded. ER and PR levels were recorded as per the Allred Score (Harvey et al, 1999). All tumours were HER-2 negative, using immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ hybridisation. Sentinel lymph node sampling data were available in all patients and no lymph node involvement was reported. The Oncotype Dx RS results were provided by Genomic Health test reports. Patients were stratified to three risk groups as per Oncotype RS: low risk (RS<18), intermediate risk (18RS<31), and high risk (RS31) (Paik et al, 2004). Ki 67 expression was examined by IHC of formalin-fixed deparaffinised tissue, using prediluted rabbit monoclonal antibody against human Ki 67 (Clone 30-9, Ventana, Tucson, AZ, USA) at a concentration of 2μgml−1. Slides were stained on automated immunostainer Benchmark XT from Ventana, using the iView DAB Detection Kit. The same tissue blocks were used for both Oncotype Dx testing and Ki 67 immunostaining. Results were assessed without the use of an image analysis system. The fraction of positive cells (in percentage) with definite nuclear immunostaining, including mild, moderate, and strong was counted. The representative fields were chosen at low magnification and included at least two areas at the most cellular edges of tumour, and one area in the centre. The number of cells counted at high-power magnification varied depending on distribution of Ki 67 immunopositive staining. For cases with even distribution, the Ki 67 staining was determined with 400\u2013600 tumoural cells, but in cases with uneven distribution, up to 2500 tumoural cells were counted. The stained slides were evaluated by two of the authors when the distribution of Ki-67-positive tumoural cells was uneven, or when the percentage of immunoreactivity was near the cut-off points. Patients were divided into low-risk (Ki 67<10%), intermediate-risk (10%Ki 67<25%), and high-risk group (Ki 6725%) on the basis of the expression of Ki 67. Ki 67<10% was considered low, based on a cut-off point used by Kronqvist et al (2004) and Breast International Group Trial 1-98 (Viale et al, 2008a,2008b). However, as there were other studies that used Ki 67>20% as their cut-off point, we decided to consider Ki 6725% as high (Colleoni et al, 2004; Viale et al, 2008a,2008b). By doing so, we could study the group of patients with Ki 67 values falling between these two numbers (Ki 67 intermediate group). The SPSS version 19 (Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Linear regression, univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, and partial correlation analysis were performed. ",

Abstract Disclosures  Background: Both the recurrence score (RS) multi-gene assay and invasion factors uPA/PAI-1 are included in guidelines (ASCO, AGO) for decision support regarding adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer (BC). Here we present the first preplanned WSG-Plan B trial correlation analysis of RS, uPA/PAI-1, and molecular subtypes by protein expression.  Methods: Plan B trial (n=2,448) is evaluating anthracycline-free adjuvant chemotherapy (6x TC) vs. 4xEC-4xDOC in HER2-negative BC. RS is used as selection criterion for chemotherapy or hormonal therapy alone; uPA/PAI-1 (by ELISA) is obtained as an optional risk factor. Central and Ki-67-modified grade and luminal B subtype (by 13.25% or 20% KI-67 cut-offs) evaluation are performed by the independent trial pathologist.  Results: From April 2009 to February 2011, 2380 patients have been recruited and 1806 randomized to the study. In 1106 pts, both RS and central grade, in 592, both Ki-67 and RS, and in 201 uPA/PAI-1 and RS were available. When considered as continuous variables, RS was weakly positively correlated (Spearman\u2019s coefficient rs) with PAI-1 (rs=0.21, p=0.003), Ki-67 (rs=0.336, p<0.001), and central grade (rs=0.498, p<0.001). When considered as risk categories, there was only a weak concordance between RS and uPA/PAI-1, using either standard RS (18; 30) or PlanB cut-offs (low risk <11 RS), with 67% of patients having high uPA/PAI-1 within the low/intermediate-RS subgroups. 29-33% of G3 tumors are allocated to the RS low-risk group. While RS high-risk was predictive of high risk by uPA/PAI-1, grade and luminal B subtype, the converse was not true; clinically relevant proportions (between 33-66%) of patients identified by uPA/PAI-1 and Ki-67 as being at high risk have low/intermediate RS.  Conclusions: For the first time, risk groups according to RS, Ki-67 and uPA/PAI-1 have been prospectively compared. These preliminary data show that the high RS group seems predictive of high uPA/PAI-1, aggressive central grade and luminal B subtype, but the converse is not true; these markers do not predict the RS. Further evaluation within the Plan B trial will clarify the clinical significance of these findings.   _________________________________________________________________________________   The conclusion bears repeating: \"Conclusions:  For the first time, risk groups according to RS, Ki-67 and uPA/PAI-1 have been prospectively compared.

Furthermore, from what I am gathering in the last year is that more and more clinicians are recommending the mammaprint test for those patients who are falling into the OncotypeDX intermediate score.  Likewise, if I was young and had a small grade 3 tumor that scored a very low OncotypeDX DX score, perhaps I would want the mammaprint test as well.   Referring back to what I mentioned to Neugirl, my medical oncologist was less interested in specific tests like the KI-67 test and the CYP2D6 test.  It appears that despite interest in the metabolism of Tamoxifen, there are still unknown complexities of the enzyme's function and whether or not it actually reduces Tamoxifen's plasma's levels.   I think in specific cases where there is sharp disagreement among oncologists as to whether or not recommend chemo, tests like the Ki-67 test might be recommended, once all other genetic tests have been exhausted.  Remember, while we might all be carriers of bad genes, we also carry a number of good genes and that's why I think my MO prefers to use the OncotypeDX score as one tool in his box to make his recommendations rather than specific tests like the KI-67 test.  While the OncotypeDX test does factor in the KI-67 test, my MO always refers to it as the poor man's version of next generation genetic testing. Lastly, from reading Eric Topol,MD's book, The Creative Destruction of Medicine, he devotes an entire chapter to genetic testing.  He mentions the CYP2D6 test as well as OncotypeDX and Mammaprint.  He even goes on to mention the genetic test that some hospitals and cardiac doctors use to see how well patients metabolize the platelet thinning drug Plavix.  One would think that the genetic test was more universally used, especially since more similar drugs have been developed since Plavix was marketed.  Unfortunately, many hospitals and physicians are not universally using the test. Sooooo, coming back to Ki-67, I think physicians now have more sophisticated tools at their disposal to help patients make informed treatment decisions.  That's not saying that the KI-67 test is unimportant.  Every piece of info is valuable, including the Ki-67 test that is incorporated into the genetic tests.  Hopefully in the near future we will have even more valuable info once the TailorX preliminary results are known so more patients can move out of the dreaded intermediate score range of the OncotypeDX test.  Until then, I still think getting a second or third medical oncologist opinion is a good idea and/or requesting that a tumor board review the case.",

      "Content": "May 2, 2013 08:58AM - edited May 2, 2013 08:59AM by voraciousreader Mepic...Could you please provide the link where you read in two places that Tamoxifen didn't really prevent mets.  I do not look through rose colored lenses when I read clinical trials.  I can appreciate how you feel about taking a medication for a long period of time especially in light of your sensitivites.  The DH has a rare metabolic disorder.  His body is also very sensitive.  I often joke, and I know it's not funny, ....that all he needs to do is look at a medication's bottle and he gets a reaction. But make NO mistake about it, Tamoxifen DOES prevent metastasis.  And for patients who DO have metastastic cancer, there are many patients taking it to keep the cancer from progressing.  Tamoxifen is a VERY powerful drug in cancer treatment. Regarding further validation of the OncotypeDX test with respect to vascular invasion...this is news to me.  Could you please provide a link to details of Genomic Health's future plans to fine tune the test?  With the newly published results of the Atlas trial with respect to taking Tamoxifen for 10 years vs 5 years, I would hope that Genomic Health would somehow fine tune their equations because the current OncotypeDX test is based on taking Tamoxifen for 5 years, which at the time the info was gathered, was the Standard of Care.  However, I have not seen ANY response from Genomic Health since the landmark study was published online in December of 2012.   So if you would like to share any published information that mentions that Genomic Health is fine tuning ANY of it's data with respect to breast cancer, I would love to read more about it. Now, regarding your trepidation of \"one size fits all\" with regard to the data and how you question the validity of the OncotypeDX scores with respect to vascular invasion, I understand your concern.  I also understand that you would really like to pinpoint EXACTLY your risk of future metastatic disease if you DECLINE endocrine therapy.  Often on this discussion board this question is asked.  Keep in mind the difference between relative risk and absolute risk.  These are very important points to remember when reading studies.  While published studies tout that Tamoxifen will reduce your chances of distant recurrence by almost 50%....that 50% is the relative risk of reduction.  However, a person really needs to know their ABSOLUTE risk of reduction.  That number is usually a figure that is much lower.  And that is what you are questioning.  And to answer that question, since we both have the same recurrence score of 15, I will tell you that NO ONE will be able to tell you EXACTLY what your absolute chances of recurrence are if you DO NOT take Tamoxifen.  On this discussion board, we've had sisters here with lower scores recur.  Likewise, I've seen sisters here have tumors that were graded more aggressive but with lower recurrence scores.  What I have learned from reading these studies is that there is no rhyme or reason to the madness of this illness.  And when you take into consideration those patients who have intermediate OncotypeDX scores and need to wait for the results of the TAILORX trial before they know conclusively if adding chemotherapy to Tamoxifen is beneficial, you then realize as much as we know about cancer, we still want to know even more!  I guess that's why the person you spoke to at Genomic Health couldn't pinpoint for you your \"true\" risk of recurrence. But I will tell you what I DO know from reading studies and our score of 15.  Cancer researchers usually classify low risk of recurrence at approximately 10% or less.  With a score of 15 we are at low risk of distant recurrence based on taking Tamoxifen.  If we choose not to take Tamoxifen, we are then at a moderate risk of distant recurrence.  Keep in mind regardless of your risk of recurrence percentage, once you have had a breast cancer diagnosis, there is ALWAYS a risk of distant recurrence despite what you may or may not do....",

Chocolate...when you have a low single digit recurrence score the chance of distant recurrence is slim. Recall however, taking the tamoxifen also reduces the risk of breast cancer in the other breast. For women with stage one cancers that are smaller than .5 cm and are ER positive, the NCCN guidelines mentions patients should consider endocrine therapy. All others, that is, larger than .5 cm, the NCCN guidelines recommend Tamoxifen regardless of Oncotype DX score.",

The reason why your physician recommended the OncotypeDX test... was probably due to the size of your tumor....BECAUSE IT IS SO SMALL....and if the other tests had come back LOWER, you probably would have NOT been recommended chemo.  However, since the OncotypeDX score looks at the genetics of the tumor, you will have additional information to help you and your doctor decide whether or NOT you can benefit from chemo.",

Furthermore, as riverhorse and many, many other sisters here have told you, you are asking questions that lead to UNDERLYING questions that have NO answers. Without a doubt, doing research and asking questions is wonderful... up to a point. I am not trying to insult you at the suggestion of getting counseling. Instead, I think it might help you, or perhaps other sisters like yourself, who reach the point where you are. Many sisters have been supportive of you by saying we have all been where you are right now. That is, gathering information with a very cloudy mind once we hear the word \"cancer\" and attempt, with the help of our teams of physicians, to come up with an active treatment plan that we can live with. None of us are ever comfortable with our decisions. Ever! Scores of sisters have so eloquently told you the same. Even you said that one of your doctors said to you regarding treatments that \"you never know for sure\" who will recur. Perhaps when one reaches the point of asking time and again questions without answers, counseling might be a great way of finding peace with a decision that no one ever feels comfortable making. Perhaps you, neugirl, don't think you need counseling now, but I want to put the word \"counseling\" out there for others as well, who might eventually find themselves on the same journey as you are right now. Furthermore, many sisters could only dream of going to get their questions answered where you went, Sloan Kettering. You have had great opportunities to get your questions answered and yet still question EVERY detail and still find the answers to your questions elusive. For those who may read this post one day, and come to the same crossroad as you, I want them and you to understand that counseling may help now and later. I do not mean for you to interpret this as being CRITICAL. I am trying to be COMPASSIONATE in explaining that counseling can be helpful. Finally, you say there is nothing wrong with finding information about the disease so you can make a treatment decision. Without a doubt, everyone should do that. But it appears that while you say you are only gathering information so you can make a decision, you have also made it very clear on a number of occasions that you have made a decision and that is that you want chemotherapy. You have also told us that none of your doctors are offering it to you. So the question that I think you should be trying to answer is why do you still feel that you need it? and if you truly believe you do need it, then I think you should find a physician who is comfortable with giving you chemo OR get counseling so you can feel comfortable about following your doctors' recommendations to NOT get chemo. The bottom line is, you can continue looking for support and that's great. But i think with all your questions you are asking, you want to hear the answer that you will NEVER recur and unfortunately, no one has, nor can anyone tell you that. For some, counseling can ease THAT pain which IMHO you are suffering from. I do wish you well and hope you can arrive at a decision soon so that you can get to your \"new normal\" sooner, like most of us, rather than later.",

But what does \"better\" mean?  Does it mean \"better\" that some patients can avoid chemo?  Or does \"better\" mean that with targeted therapies and chemo one stands a better chance of living a long life?  And, along with the uncertainty of the meaning of \"better\"... We have researchers and clinicians who understand that whatever \" better\" treatment that it is that they are proposing, they must first, do no harm.  As countless sisters and I have told AA and she fails to APPRECIATE is that the DEFINITIVE PROOF that she keeps asking for, cannot be obtained at this moment in time nor in the immediate future.   Presently, there is a trial for HER 2 Positive patients who are over 70 that offers them Herceptin WITHOUT chemo.  Will enough brave sisters join the study? As of now, there is no answer.  But make no mistake about it.  Researchers and clinicians are very aware that HER 2 Positive studies are needed and necessary. However, ethics drive the design of those studies and AA refuses to yield to that IMPORTANT FACT.  ",

Since the development of AIs, other studies compare the data from Tamoxifen with AIs.  To my knowledge there is no study comparing OncotypeDX scores using an AI.  Now getting back to the samples.  Using 600+ tissue samples, researchers extrapolated the genes that they believed showed which ones would likely benefit from chemo.  They also were able to tease out from the samples who did well by just taking Tamoxifen.  Once they determined those genes, then they were able to test their OncotypeDX score against a database of 5,000 of Kaiser Permanente patients who had been treated for breast cancer over a decade.  It was then independently validated on another 2,600 patients. They were also able to distinguish the outcomes of those who were and were not treated with Tamoxifen.  So, the sample which designed the test was small, but the actual sample population against which the OncotypeDx score was born from, is larger.",

However, if you find out that you are HER2 positive, then it is usually recommended that you receive chemo and herception.  Keep in mind that your treatment plan also takes into consideration if you have other health care issues and your age. While you wait for more information, I strongly recommend that you register at the NCCN website and read their 2012 PROFESSIONALS' verision of their breast cancer treatment guidelines. Right now the most important thing is to nail down the EXACT pathology of your tumor.  Afterwards, the second most important thing is to gather as much information about treatment as possible.  This requires an open mind and often visits with numerous physicians to come up with a treatment plan that YOU are comfortable with. Good luck!",

Without a doubt there are sisters who will choose chemo if it improves their chances by as little as 1%. So in that respect, it is a very personal decision. Now there's a big however when you look at the statistics. If you were told you had a 15% chance of recurrence and the chemo gave you an absolute benefit of 5%, and it brings you down to 10% chance of recurrence, then relatively speaking in statistical terms, that is a large reduction in terms of recurrence...33%. Most physicians will recommend neo adjuvant chemo or adjuvant chemo when your chance of absolute recurrence exceeds 10%. In fact, if you score below 18 on the Oncotype test which is considered low risk of absolute recurrence, your chance of recurrence is less than 11% (with the understanding that you will be doing endocrine therapy). So basically, what that doctor is saying to you in his opinion, is that 5% reduction is bringing you down to a 10% chance of absolute recurrence, which brings you down into the low risk of recurrence category. Again, I wish to reiterate that it's important to nail down the pathology of your tumor and see if you can absolutely confirm the HER2 status. That is very important information. Once you gather the info and find physicians whose opinions you respect, then ultimately, you will become more comfortable with whatever decision you make. Finally, I notice you have a grade 1 tumor. Grade 1 tumors often respond better with endocrine therapy than they do to chemo if you are HER2 negative. So, if you get many mixed opinions, I would suggest that your case be presented to a tumor board. You have a number of favorable prognostics, but that is no guarantee. You don't mention whether you are pre or post menopausal. Some pre menopausal women choose ovarian suppression rather than chemo. Read pages 93-98 in the NCCN guidelines to learn more about ovarian suppression and endocrine therapy. Good luck.",

Some patients will refer to an \"11\" OncotypeDx score as being the cut off for chemo. It appears that some patients are choosing chemo if their score is above that number based on the TailorX clinical trial. That trial is underway now and the results are years away. The reason for the trial was to determine which patients with intermediate Oncotype DX scores would benefit from chemo. The logic of the trial in including low scores between 11 and 18 was justified so they could precisely see where the benefit curve occurs for those with even higher scores. So, once TailorX is completed, there is a good chance that those with Oncotype DX intermediate scores of 19, 20 and higher MIGHT also be considered low risk. Likewise, the trial might underscore that those with scores of 11-18 are not benefiting AT ALL from chemo. No one knows the answer. But, as of now, a low score is below 18. That said, the risks of chemo would outweigh the benefits for a score below 18. Remember, the Oncotype score is just one tool used to weigh whether chemo is right for you.",

      "Content": "Apr 26, 2012 10:01AM voraciousreader wrote: and this comes from breastcancer.org as well: Brachytherapy May Not Be as Effective as Whole-Breast Radiation in Reducing Recurrence Risk 2011-12-06T06:30:00-04:00 Radiation therapy commonly is used after lumpectomy to treat early-stage breast cancer and reduce the risk of the cancer coming back (recurrence). Brachytherapy is a newer form of radiation therapy and an alternative to traditional whole-breast external beam radiation therapy. Brachytherapy delivers a higher dose of radiation to a smaller area of the breast over a shorter period of time compared to traditional (external beam) radiation therapy. Doctors sometimes refer to brachytherapy as accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Brachytherapy use has been increasing steadily since it was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002. Still, many experts have been concerned about the increase because there aren't many long-term studies that show that brachytherapy works as well as traditional radiation therapy. Now results from a large study suggest that brachytherapy may not be as effective as whole-breast radiation therapy at preventing breast cancer recurrence. Women in the study who got brachytherapy after lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer were nearly twice as likely to later have a mastectomy because of cancer recurrence compared to women who got traditional whole-breast radiation therapy. The results were presented at the 2011 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Traditional external beam radiation therapy aims cancer-destroying energy at the whole breast or to the area of the breast where the cancer was. The source of the radiation is outside the breast, which is why it's called \"external beam.\" Many studies have shown the long- and short-term effectiveness of external beam radiation therapy. The drawbacks of traditional radiation therapy include daily trips to the hospital for treatments -- typically 5 days a week for 4 to 6 weeks. Traditional radiation therapy also has a large field and may expose healthy tissue, such as the heart and lungs, to radiation. To overcome the drawbacks of traditional radiation therapy, doctors have developed different ways to deliver radiation. Brachytherapy places the radiation source inside the breast. Two types of brachytherapy are used right now and another is experimental. They are: To see if brachytherapy was as good as traditional whole-breast radiation, researchers reviewed the treatment histories and outcomes of more than 130,000 women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer who had lumpectomy to remove the cancer. All the women had radiation therapy after surgery -- either traditional whole-breast radiation therapy or brachytherapy (multi-catheter internal radiation therapy or MammoSite). The researchers looked to see how many women had mastectomy during the 5 years after lumpectomy and radiation: Overall, complications from brachytherapy were much higher than with traditional whole-breast radiation therapy: Other treatment complications -- such as rib fracture, breakdown of fat in the breast (fat necrosis), breast pain, and inflammation in the lungs -- were more likely among women treated with brachytherapy. Some of the higher complication rates may be because brachytherapy requires a device to be implanted under the skin. Besides being a quicker way to deliver radiation therapy, many doctors like brachytherapy because the radiation delivery is focused, potentially avoiding exposing healthy tissue to radiation. Even though brachytherapy is becoming more popular, experts continue to warn that right now there's not enough evidence to confidently conclude that brachytherapy is as effective and safe as traditional whole-breast radiation therapy. The results of this study suggest that this caution makes sense. Still, some experts feel that the results reflect early use of brachytherapy and that doctors are now better at using brachytherapy more effectively and safely. Several very large, well-designed studies are currently being done to evaluate the short-term and long-term effectiveness and safety of brachytherapy compared to traditional whole-breast radiation therapy. It will be several years before the results are available. If you've been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, are having lumpectomy, and will be receiving radiation therapy after surgery, you and your doctor may consider brachytherapy as an alternative to traditional external beam radiation therapy. Perhaps the daily trips to the treatment center would be a burden because of distance. Talk to your doctors about their experience with brachytherapy compared to traditional radiation therapy. You also may want to ask about their familiarity with the technical aspects of delivering brachytherapy since placement of the catheters or balloon is a skill that can take some time to master. The Breastcancer.org Radiation Therapy section has more information on both traditional external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy.",

So I should start the summer clean as a whisle!  Now colon polyps that go untreated are more likely to develop into cancer.  Removing a colon polyp will reduce one's chance of dying from colon cancer by 50%.  Unlike screening mammography, colon screening is truly preventative!  Take a colon polyp out and you are likely to avoid a cancer diagnosis down the road.  With screening mammography, no one knows with certainty when you remove a precancerous legion if it would have become cancerous.  That's why population based mammography is more controversial than colonoscopy screening.  We are great at finding anomalies when we screen asymptomatic populations...the question is how proactive do we truly need to be once we find them...

The populations examined were women who received conservative surgery followed by \"standard\" postoperative whole-breast radiation versus partial-breast brachytherapy (in the absence of whole-breast radiation) during this time interval. Of interest, the investigators noted that the use of brachytherapy for breast cancer in this Medicare population increased from less than 1% of the population in 2000 to 13% in 2007 (P < .001). As a group, the patients managed with the brachytherapy approach were somewhat older than individuals undergoing whole-breast radiation. However, the major finding in this report was that women who received local brachytherapy experienced a doubling (4% vs 2.2%) in their subsequent risk of undergoing a mastectomy compared with the population of individuals managed with whole-breast radiation after surgery. The investigators also noted an increased incidence of infectious and noninfectious complications (rib fracture, fat necrosis, breast pain) associated with the brachytherapy management strategy compared with whole-breast radiation. The controversy regarding this presentation developed quickly following the meeting with these preliminary results being widely disseminated in the popular press. Several groups involved in the development of accelerated partial-breast radiation strategies provided a strong public rebuttal to this report,5 noting that: (1) cancer recurrence rates were not reported in this analysis; (2) the rate of subsequent mastectomy did not equate with the risk of recurrence, since a mastectomy could have been undertaken for a number of other reasons, including infection or personal choice; (3) the stated risk of complications in this analysis was considerably higher than that reported in published studies specifically addressing this issue for accelerated partial-breast radiation; and (4) newer improved strategies for local radiation in the management of breast cancer have been developed since the years covered in the Medicare database. Of course, it is important to note that presentations at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, as is the case at all such meetings, must be considered preliminary reports until the data have been subjected to appropriate detailed analysis and published in the peer-reviewed medical literature. That being said, it is clear that this meeting remains one of the most important international forums for the presentation and discussion of critically important study results related to the management of breast cancer.",

Studies like TailorX would be unnecessary and meaningless if patients relied on anecdotal evidence.  Surely you were given the most recent available evidence at the time of your diagnosis. Reading other patients\u2019 experiences, I sometimes have to wonder if they were given as much info as was needed. As I look back on my experience, it wasn\u2019t until years later that I realized that my team gave me a wealth of info, more so than it appears other sisters received. Most importantly, I never gave weight to any anecdotal evidence. I think that is where the perception of ridicule you may be describing is coming from. Perhaps others might think, like I do, that there is no place for anecdotal evidence. Bottom line....you made what you feel was your best decision based on whatever criteria it was that you felt was important.  I wish you continued good health",

The hormone generally used is tamoxifen, and it is usually given for five years. It has also been shown that suppressing (shutting down) the ovaries (which stops them from making hormones such as estrogen) helps prevent breast cancers from coming back in women who are premenopausal (women whose ovaries are still making hormones). This study is being done to see if shutting down the ovaries plus giving tamoxifen is better at preventing the return of breast cancer than just giving tamoxifen alone in premenopausal women. It will also test whether a newer hormone drug called exemestane plus suppression of the ovaries is better than tamoxifen plus suppression of the ovaries.

They found based on genomics that some tumors with favorable grade 1 labels were genetically more aggressive and warranted chemo. Likewise, some grade 3 tumors didn't genetically express the need for chemo. So, the takeaway message is that the Oncotype DX serves as one tool of many in helping patients and their physicans make the best treatment decision.",

The conclusion that I draw from THIS study is that there are still a large number of patients forgoing the test because they have larger Grade 3 tumors and are choosing chemo and make the results of the Oncotype DX test moot.  I can also conclude that pathologists opinions vary more so with Grade 1 and 2 tumors.  And, that based on this study, the Oncotype DX test is identifying more patients who SHOULD be getting chemo. Lidzy, I'm sure you will arrive at an active treatment plan that you are comfortable with!  Since you are post menopausal, you might wish to discuss adding Zometa to your treatment plan.  Although it is still being studied and is not recommended in the NCCN guidelines, there is growing evidence that it helps reduce mortality in ER positive, postmenopausal patients.",

Quite often, you have to ease yourself off of the medication slowly.  Likewise, a newer class of meds, like Ambien, were invented because they were less likely to become addictive and were less likely to build up a tolerance.  But the bottom line is that BOTH classes of meds are for \"occasional\" use, but most doctors will prescribe them indefinitely.  And when I say, \"most doctors,\" I am referring to PCP's who have little experience in prescribing these meds. When people have chronic sleep issues, they should be under the care of a doctor who has experience with sleep issues.  Sometimes, just going to sleep at the same time every night and reducing caffine and more exercise will eliminate or reduce the need for tranquilizers.   Likewise, if there is an underlying issue, such as anxiety or depression, that contributes to the sleep issue, then that needs to be addressed.  Sometimes, a psychotrophic medication will suffice. Tranquilizers have a place in the treatment of sleep issues.  But, IMHO, it's best to have a doctor who has experience in sleep issues doing the prescribing.",

One reason is that the test is NOT as strongly validated for our types of BC and because of the mostly favorable characteristics of the rare breast cancers. While a score in the high 20's for a tubular breast cancer seems rather high, remember there are outliers and obviously you are one of them. I think that with the rare favorable histology sub-types we also have protective genes as well that aren't accounted for in the OncotypeDX test.

Brachytherapy is a newer form of radiation therapy and an alternative to traditional whole-breast external beam radiation therapy. Brachytherapy delivers a higher dose of radiation to a smaller area of the breast over a shorter period of time compared to traditional (external beam) radiation therapy. Doctors sometimes refer to brachytherapy as accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). In the United States, brachytherapy use has been increasing steadily since it was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002. A large study has found that many women who were treated with brachytherapy were not good candidates for that form of radiation therapy based on the characteristics of the breast cancer with which they were diagnosed. These women may have been better treated with traditional whole breast radiation instead. The results were published in the Dec. 16, 2011 online edition of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Traditional external beam radiation therapy aims cancer-destroying energy at the whole breast or to the area of the breast where the cancer was. The source of the radiation is outside the breast, which is why it's called \"external beam.\" Many studies have shown the long- and short-term effectiveness of external beam radiation therapy. The drawbacks of traditional radiation therapy include daily trips to the hospital for treatments -- typically 5 days a week for 4 to 6 weeks. Traditional radiation therapy also has a large field and may expose healthy tissue, such as the heart and lungs, to radiation. To overcome the drawbacks of traditional radiation therapy, doctors have developed different ways to deliver radiation. Brachytherapy places the radiation source inside the breast. Two types of brachytherapy are used right now and another is experimental. They are: In 2009 a panel of experts from the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) developed guidelines to help doctors decide which women are good candidates for brachytherapy. The ASTRO brachytherapy guidelines classify patients into one of three groups: ASTRO brachytherapy classification is based on a number of cancer characteristics, including: Researchers looked at the medical records of nearly 139,000 women treated with radiation therapy after surgery for early-stage breast cancer. The records were in a national health database called SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results). All the women were treated sometime between 2000 and 2007, before the ASTRO brachytherapy guidelines were released in 2009. About 2.6% of the women got brachytherapy. The brachytherapy suitability of each of these women was classified using the 2009 ASTRO guidelines. For the women who got brachytherapy, the researchers found: Even though the women in the study were treated with brachytherapy before the ASTRO guidelines were developed, the results suggest that many women unsuitable for brachytherapy are getting brachytherapy. This possibility is more of a concern because brachytherapy use has continued to increase since 2007 when the last of the patients in this study were treated. Findings from another large study suggest that brachytherapy may not be as effective as whole-breast radiation therapy at reducing recurrence risk. Women in that study who got brachytherapy after lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer were nearly twice as likely to later have a mastectomy because of cancer recurrence compared to women who got traditional whole-breast radiation therapy. That study also found that treatment complications -- such as rib fracture, breakdown of fat in the breast (fat necrosis), breast pain, and inflammation in the lungs -- were more likely among women treated with brachytherapy. Some of these higher complication rates may be because brachytherapy requires a device to be implanted under the skin. Besides being a quicker way to deliver radiation therapy, many doctors like brachytherapy because the radiation delivery is focused, potentially avoiding exposing healthy tissue to radiation. Even though brachytherapy is becoming more popular, experts continue to warn that right now there's not enough evidence to confidently conclude that brachytherapy is as effective and safe as traditional whole-breast radiation therapy. The studies discussed here suggest that this caution makes sense. Still, some experts feel that the results reflect early use of brachytherapy and that doctors are now better at using brachytherapy more effectively and safely. Several very large, well-designed studies are currently being done to evaluate the short-term and long-term effectiveness and safety of brachytherapy compared to traditional whole-breast radiation therapy. It will be several years before the results are available. If you've been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, are having lumpectomy, and will be receiving radiation therapy after surgery, you and your doctor may consider brachytherapy as an alternative to traditional external beam radiation therapy. Perhaps the daily trips to the treatment center would be a burden because of distance. Talk to your doctors about their experience with brachytherapy compared to traditional radiation therapy. You also may want to ask about their familiarity with the technical aspects of delivering brachytherapy since placement of the catheters or balloon is a skill that can take some time to master. It also makes sense to ask about your suitability for brachytherapy based on the 2009 ASTRO guidelines. The Breastcancer.org Radiation Therapy section has more information on both traditional external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy",

      "Content": "Mar 19, 2014 10:07PM - edited Mar 19, 2014 11:47PM by voraciousreader Kam...here's an interesting study regarding the use of the OncotypeDX test and how it affected decisions.  It seems that, overall, quite a number of low and intermediate grade patients had high OncotypeDX scores and 1/3 of patients with Grade 3 tumors that were smaller than 1 cm had high recurrence scores... yet only 68% of those with high scores chose chemo.  Likewise, analysis found that in younger patients, despite low recurrence scores, 33% chose chemotherapy or ovarian suppression. http://ecancer.org/journal/7/pdf/380-the-impact-of-the-oncotype-dx-recurrence-score-on-treatment-decisions-and-clinical-outcomes-in-patients-with-early-breast-cancer-the-maccabi-healthcare-services-experience-with-a-unified-testing-policy.php \"Next, we evaluated the treatment approach in 293 patients aged ≤ 50 years, and assessed physicians\u2019 choice of chemotherapy and/or LHRH agonists in addition to hormonal therapy with tamoxifen (LHRH agonists are considered as a potential substitute for chemotherapy in ER+ premenopausal women [12\u201317]) versus none. In this age group, overall, a more aggressive treatment approach was noted, and even in the low Recurrence Score group, close to one-third of patients received chemotherapy and/or LHRH agonists. Still, the proportion of patients receiving LHRH agonists and/or chemotherapy varied significantly across Recurrence....\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- According to this study... 20% of patients with Grade 3 tumors had LOW recurrence scores...and according to the researchers, they hope that once the TailorX trial is completed they will be better able to assess the outliers...However, it appears until that is known, more younger patients will continue to get more aggressive treatment..... \"The rationale for the MHS policy is to identify patients whose lives may be saved by early chemotherapy use and who may not otherwise be considered for chemotherapy by the treating physicians. Indeed, follow-up data on this cohort, despite being limited (median of 26 months), with the various treatment approaches as detailed, showed only four locoregional recurrences, one in a patient borderline for eligibility and another in a noneligible patient. The MHS policy excludes patients with large Grade 3 tumours based on findings from the original Paik et al [1] report that assessed 668 tamoxifen-treated patients in the NSABP B-14 study and showed that high grade still had significant prognostic value in multivariable analysis, including the Recurrence Score. While in that report, concordance for histology grade was only 59\u201365% between two pathologists, it was highest for poorly differentiated tumours (kappa, 0.61) [1]. It should be noted, however, that low Recurrence Score may occur in about 20% of patients with Grade 3 tumours [1, 5], and that a Recurrence Score\u2013pathology-clinical (RSPC) assessment was found to be more prognostic for distant recurrence than Recurrence Score alone [23]; nonetheless, the NSABP B20 data analysis suggests that Recurrence Score is still the best predictor of chemotherapy benefit (RSPC was not predictive of chemotherapy benefit [23]). We expect the data from a prospective trial that incorporates both Recurrence Score results and grade (the ongoing TAILORx trial), to best define their relative significance. Another molecular classification method using genomic grading index also supports the use of molecular classification mostly in Grade 2 tumours [24, 25]. To overcome potential inaccuracies in Grade 3 tumour readings, the MHS policy allows pathological reviews of all large Grade 3 tumours and approves Oncotype DX testing if one of the reviewers considers the tumour to be of lower grade....\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ So, what this study is saying is that it appears that with older patients, the Recurrence Score is more helpful in deciding whether chemo is necessary.  However, it also shows that MORE people should have chemo based on high recurrence scores, but are not choosing it.   However, with younger women, despite low recurrence scores, patients are more likely to still receive chemo or ovarian suppression.  The good news, in the few years of the study, very few patients died and they usually died of other causes. I think until the results of TailorX are known, for those patients in the gray area, or outliers, those with Grade 3 tumors with low scores or Grade 1 with high scores, it might be a good idea to have the additional Mammaprint as the tie breaker.  I think all of these situations should be explained to a patient before they agree to have the Oncotype DX test, because there is a distinct possibility that the results will be ambiguous.  In fact, I sometimes regret having had the test and knowing that my score is 15.  For sure there was relief in knowing that the risks of chemo outweighed the benefit.  And it is also nice to know that for mucinous breast cancer the \"average\" score is 15, so I fit  \"nicely\" into the statistics and confirmed that my Grade 1 tumor was at low risk of recurrence.  However,  due to my age, I was informed that although the Recurrence Score was affirmative of my pathology report, I was still encouraged to be a little more aggressive with my treatment.  So, at the end of the day, I'm not sure that the Oncotype DX test brought much to the table except proving I wasn't an outlier.    I was told in advance of the test to do ovarian suppression and 10 years of endocrine therapy and this was BEFORE the Atlas preliminary results were known. Bottom line, regarding the above study,  there's still more people who should be getting chemo based on the Oncotype DX test who aren't, and there are young women, who despite low scores are getting it.......",

Kec....as I said earlier on another thread, talk with your radiologist and perhaps, get a second opinion if you have concerns. While I think it is healthy to have some skepticism about radiation, whether it be targeted or whole breast radiation, at some point, I think it is important to have trust in your team, so you can be at peace with your decisions.  One of the things I learned on this journey was that I could never, ever, know as much as I wanted and needed to know to make an informed treatment decision. That was the most difficult thing about this journey that I learned about myself.  Before this journey began, being a voracious reader, always helped me make informed decisions. But this journey taught me something. And, that is, that no matter how much I knew and ultimately learned, would NEVER substitute for the amount of EXPERIENCE and knowledge my team had when it came to MY situation. I realized right then and there that I needed to let go. I needed to let go of trying to gain as much knowledge as I could.i needed to let go of being in control. And guess what? Letting go of being in control and letting other people, who had more experience and knowledge than i could ever gain in such a short period of time, was refreshing!  And that journey has made some other journeys a lot easier for me. Whether it be as simple as choosing something to eat from a menu and asking the server what they recommend and choosing their recommendation or choosing medical or legal advice, my life has become less stressful and is now more vibrant and as I said earlier, more refreshing! No more reading until my eyes are bleary and my nerves are shot. My brain is no longer bloated. Once I trust the person in front of me, I am DELIGHTED that they can decide something for me.  I know cancer is scary. But so is living. Each day, believe it or not, we make tens of thousands of decisions. That\u2019s right! We make tens of thousands of decisions. The voracious reader that I am, read that in a neuroscience book. Surely, some of those decisions are tiny ones and some are humongous. However, how they affect the brain is quite similar, if not the same. All those decisions make us do something, even if it is nothing at all. So, I now know that ALL of my decisions lead to some form of action. I feel better when IACTIVELY decide to let others make decisions for me!  So, gather whatever info it is that you need to make you feel better and informed. And then, TRY to let the heavy lifters, that is your medical team, do the heavy lifting! Perhaps then, this journey and all future journeys will be easier....",

Of the 25,475 tumors tested over nearly a 2-year period and reviewed by academic breast pathologists, about 80% were pure ductal histology: most (94.5%) were either ductal, lobular, or mixed histologies and about 5% were less common subtypes. Compared with the median RS for ductal carcinoma (18.2), median RS was significantly lower for classic lobular (17.5), solid/alveolar lobular (16.1), mixed ductal/lobular (17.4), tubular (15.2), cribiform (13.7), mucinous (16.6), and papillary (7.8) subtypes. It was higher for the medullary-like (33.1) subtype. RS ranged in most subtypes from a low of < 10 (usually ≤ 3) to a high of approximately 60 to 90 in most subtypes, except tubular cancers, which rarely had high RS. Although tubular cancers exhibited somewhat lower median quantitative ER expression than ductal cancers (9.2 vs 9.7), their proliferation scores were substantially lower (4.3 vs 5.3). This report provides some insight into the biologic characteristics of less common breast cancer subtypes\"  From looking at those data, it would seem to me with those average \"low\" scores, patients would still benefit taking the Oncotype DX test AND having adjuvant endocrine therapy.",

Anything below 18 is low despite the Tailor study. Likewise. The Oncotype Dx test is simply one of several tools that doctors use to help make treatment decisions. Some doctors rely heavily on the test, while others merely use it to confirm their proposed treatment.

If she chooses chemo, how much benefit might she have?  If her life expectancy is more than 5 or more years and SHE thinks she is up to the possible risks and side effects, then doing chemo might be warranted.  Does she have other co-morbidities?  Are they well maintained? I don't think any of us can tell you what the appropriate path should be.  Do 88 year old women get chemo?  I'm sure some do.  Let a tumor board with multiple doctors guide her.  Ultimately only she will know what she needs to do.

Gina Kolata, the medical writer for the New York Times, recently discussed the theory that the normal cells surrounding a neoplastic lesion and the body's immuno-surveillance system can play a critical role in a tumor's invasive potential (see: Old Ideas Spur New Approaches in Cancer Fight). I have always believed this to be the case but this theory is now being taken more seriously in the research community. She cites a number of research studies that support this argument. One passage from her article relating to the possible adverse consequences of diagnostic breast biopsies caught my attention. I quote it  below: The question that is being asked above is whether a breast biopsy, initiated for the purpose of cancer diagnosis, can, in and of itself, promote the development of an invasive cancer on the basis of the inflammation and healing process that inexorably follows all biopsies. The basic idea is that these processes induce porosity of the basement membranes of breast ducts and enable the previously contained DCIS cells to escape into the surrounding tissue. Obviously, work will continue on this sequence of events to determine, first, whether this is a valid hypothesis and, second, whether the process can be blocked with, say, anti-inflammatory drugs. At the present time, breast biopsies are unavoidable because surgical pathology examination is the gold standard of breast diagnosis. However, in-situ techniques for the microscopic examination of tissue are rapidly being developed. Molecular imaging is also improving. All of these emerging diagnostic techniques may at some time be able to provide reliable diagnoses without disruption of the breast tissue.

I realize that the OncotypeDX score is simply one tool of many in deciding whether or not chemo is right for an individual.  Age is most certainly a factor, as well as menopausal status in determining whether or not chemo is appropriate.  I just find it hard to believe that a physician would arbitrarily choose a score of 11 for a younger women, to decide whether or not chemo is appropriate, since there is no supportive data at this time.  Finally, for women with low risk of recurrence and choose not to do chemotherapy, because the risks might outweigh the benefits, there are many more treatments under investigation that are available such as ovarian suppression and/or Zometa infusions...While the data is more compelling for women closer to menopause to do Zometa infusions, rather than younger women, the data is very promising.  Likewise, in the SOFT trial, ovarian suppression for ER+ tumors is looking promising as well.   ",

I researched the logic behind the lowering of the low risk category for TailorX. My understanding was that in order to PROVE that the risk of chemo outweighed the benefit, they had to include patients with low scores. That way they could prove the outcomes for low risk patients were the same. The idea behind TAILORX was to tighten the intermediate range. That is, determine at what intermediate score there is a true benefit of chemo. I think the design of the study is an excellent one. I also think the folks who make the OncotypeDx test would never have gotten the test approved, had they not had the statistics to back up the test. As my three medical oncologists concurred, a low score signifies little to no benefit of chemo. Will be interesting to see the results of the TailorX trial and whether or not more INTERMEDIATE range patients can defer chemo.

First off, the study was designed to give more information about women who have Oncotype Dx intermediate scores and determine if chemo's benefits outweigh the risks. Including women in the low score category should ultimately prove that chemo was truly not necessary for women with the lowest scores ..... While perhaps also showing that a number of women with intermediate scores could defer chemo as well. The folks that designed the study needed to include the low risk women so the Oncotype Dx low scores could be validated AND they could begin to see where among the intermediate scores women could safely defer the chemo. Bottom line is a low score, below 18 still means the benefit of chemo is little or none.",

[Zoledronic Acid Sinks as Breast Cancer Therapy in AZURE Trial] Updated results for the ABCSG (Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group) Trial 12 continue to show disease-free and overall survival benefits 2 years after stopping adjuvant endocrine treatment with zoledronic acid (Zometa), according to an update presented at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. The positive Austrian trial randomized 899 premenopausal women on goserelin (Zoladex) to 3 years of zoledronic acid with either tamoxifen or anastrozole (Arimidex) and 904 comparators to endocrine therapy alone (N. Engl. J. Med. 2009;360:679-91). At a median follow-up of 62 months (2 years after treatment completion), zoledronic acid reduced the risk of disease-free survival events by 32%, compared with endocrine therapy alone (hazard ratio, 0.68; P = .008). Better disease-free survival was seen whether the women were on tamoxifen (HR, 0.67) or anastrozole (HR, 0.68). A trend toward reduced risk of death with zoledronic acid also endured (HR, 0.67; P = .09). \"We observed persistence of benefit with adjuvant zoledronic acid in the ABCSG-12 trial,\" said Dr. Michael Gnant, president of the ABCSG, at the press briefing where Dr. Robert Coleman reported no disease-free survival benefit overall (adjusted HR, 0.98; P = .79) from adjuvant zoledronic acid in the AZURE (Adjuvant Treatment With Zoledronic Acid in Stage II/III Breast Cancer) trial. \"Why are the ABCSG-12 results so different from the premenopausal [women] in AZURE?\" asked Dr. Gnant, professor of surgery at the Medical University of Vienna. \"I believe that when you look closely, there is minimal overlap in patient selection and treatment,\" he said. \"All of them [in the ABCSG-12 trial] were put into artificial menopause for 3 years with the use of goserelin. None of these patients had adjuvant chemotherapy. I think that's an important difference from the AZURE trial,\" said Dr. Gnant. In the AZURE trial, 96% of patients had adjuvant chemotherapy, and none got ovarian function-suppression treatment. Also, in the ABCSG-12 trial, about 70% of patients had low-risk, stage I breast cancer. Patients in the AZURE trial had stage II or III breast cancer. Patients in the ABCSG-12 trial were randomized to one of four treatment groups: 20 mg/day tamoxifen; 20 mg/day tamoxifen plus 4 mg zoledronic acid every 6 months; 1 mg/day anastrozole; or 1 mg/day anastrozole plus 4 mg zoledronic acid every 6 months. Treatment lasted for 3 years. All patients received 3.6-mg subcutaneous goserelin every 28 days. In all, 1,803 patients were enrolled between 1999 and 2006. As of May 18, 2010, 186 disease-free survival events and 73 deaths were recorded: 45 locoregional relapse events, 100 distant relapse events (including 53 bone metastasis events), and 14 contralateral breast cancer events. Adding zoledronic acid to endocrine therapy was associated with a continued reduction in recurrences inside and outside bone. [FDA: Bevacizumab Should No Longer Be Indicated for Breast Cancer] Adverse events associated with zoledronic acid treatment (arthralgia, bone pain, and pyrexia) were generally mild and consistent with the established safety profile. Zoledronic acid did not increase the occurrence of serious adverse events, compared with endocrine therapy alone. Importantly, there was no significant renal toxicity and no confirmed cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw. \"I find it quite intriguing and actually reassuring that with this therapeutic intervention that lasted 3 years - just an infusion every 6 months - you can change something in the long-term outcome of these patients,\" said Dr. Gnant. \"When we break it down according to additional preplanned subgroups, actually we see that ... adjuvant bisphosphonate treatment works in every subgroup, at least if you look at the tumor-derived parameters.\" The addition of adjuvant zoledronic acid may not make much difference in patients younger than 40 years, he suggested: \"It's exactly that group of patients where we cannot assume that the goserelin treatment will lead to full suppression of ovarian function and to very low estrogen levels,\" he said. Among patients aged 40 years or older in ABCSG-12, however, there was a roughly 40% difference in disease-free survival, which translated into a 40% reduction in the risk of dying from breast cancer, although this did not reach statistical significance. [Dual Anti-HER2 Blockade Called the Future of Breast Cancer Therapy] The AZURE researchers also did extensive planned subgroup analyses. \"One clearly stands out from all the others. That is the treatment effect on disease-free survival according to menopausal status,\" observed Dr. Coleman, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Sheffield (England). There was a clear overall survival benefit for women at least 5 years out from menopause on zoledronic acid. These women had a 29% reduction in the risk of death (P = .017). \"While obviously it's fair to say that the overall result of AZURE is a little bit disappointing, scientifically it makes perfect sense,\" said Dr. Gnant. \"Perfect suppression - or a natural lack of estrogen - in combination with adjuvant zoledronic acid leads to significant disease-free and overall survival benefit.\" To put the results in practical terms, Dr. Gnant noted that for the past 2 years, he would have put his 42-year-old wife on zoledronic acid if she developed ER-positive breast cancer, but not his 83-year-old mother. \"This has changed this afternoon. Now, my 83-year-old mother would also receive zoledronic acid,\" he said. The ABCSG-12 trial was sponsored by Austrian Breast & Colorectal Cancer Study Group, with support from AstraZenaca (which makes Arimedex) and Novartis Pharmaceutical (which makes Zometa). Dr. Gnant disclosed that he has significant financial relationships with several pharmaceutical companies, including Novartis. [Women's Health Initiative: New Findings on Big-Three Cancer Rates] The AZURE trial was sponsored by the University of Sheffield. Dr. Coleman disclosed that he receives grant support from Novartis and is a speaker for Novartis and Amgen.",

Once they were published the you know what hit the fan!  Harvard trained and professor John Abramson, MD, wrote a critical reaction to the guidelines.  In a book written a few years ago, he questioned the use of statins by so many people.  I highly recommend reading his book as well, Overdosed America.  Now, one of the lightening points of Dr. Abramson is that aside from primary use of statins for those who have previously had a heart attack and for those at truly high risk of having a heart attack, statins will save very few other lives.  And, we still have no explanation why so many people who have normal cholesterol numbers, eat well, are not diabetic, have normal blood pressure STILL develop heart disease.  So it is an equally sobering point that there is a treatment out there, a statin, much like chemo, that might not reduce one's risk of getting a potentially fatal disease.  Frustrating? Yes!  But we do have cause to be hopeful. Because if you read Eric Topol, MD's book, The Creative Destruction of Medicine, you will see how we are moving towards a more individualized type of research and treatment of disease.  Ultimately, we will no longer have such long and largely populated trials that yield little info on what is the best treatment. So while we may be frustrated now, there are glimpses of what we will be doing in the coming decade that will please many of us. The sobering thought today is that medicine claims to offer so many treatments for so many diseases, but the fact remains that we never know in most cases with certainty who can benefit the most or least from any one treatment.",

Disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival, and recurrence rates did not differ significantly between patients who received the bisphosphonate and those who did not. A prespecified subgroup analysis showed significant interaction between treatment and menopausal status, Robert Coleman, MD, said here at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Postmenopausal patients had a 29% reduction in the mortality hazard when treated with zoledronic acid, whereas premenopausal patients did not benefit. \"A highly significant heterogeneity of effect by menopausal status was seen, with improved DFS and overall survival in those more than five years post-menopause,\" Coleman, of the University of Sheffield in England, said at a news briefing. \"Adjuvant bisphosphonate efficacy may be dependent on a low estrogen concentration within the bone microenvironment.\" Updated results of another study of adjuvant zoledronic acid showed a 32% improvement in DFS in premenopausal patients with early-stage breast cancer, treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy after surgery. Comparison of patient populations from the two studies showed substantial differences that might have accounted for the different results. Coleman reported findings from the Adjuvant Zoledronic Acid to Reduce Recurrence (AZURE) trial, the largest-ever study of adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy in breast cancer. The primary objective of the study was to determine whether the bisphosphonate would reduce breast cancer patients' risk of recurrence. The rationale for the study came from preclinical evidence that the agents may affect the microenvironment that permits cancer cell growth. Investigators at 174 centers in England enrolled 3,360 patients with stage II/III breast cancer. All patients had surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and/or adjuvant hormonal therapy and were randomized to either zoledronic acid or placebo. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, determined after 940 qualifying events. Secondary endpoints included invasive DFS, overall survival, and bone metastasis-free survival. After a median follow-up of five years, the two treatment groups had virtually identical DFS and invasive DFS, as both outcomes were associated with hazard ratios of 0.98. Additionally, 243 deaths had occurred in the zoledronic acid arm compared with 276 in the control arm, resulting in a trend favoring the bisphosphonate (HR 0.85, P=0.07). A prespecified analysis of DFS by menopausal status showed distinctly different results in pre- and postmenopausal patients (P=0.001 for heterogeneity). The DFS hazard was increased in women who were premenopausal or menopausal for less than five years. The hazard was decreased in postmenopausal women. Analysis of survival by menopausal status showed no difference in survival among premenopausal patients (HR 1.01) but a statistically significant reduction in the hazard for postmenopausal women (HR 0.71, P=0.017). Commenting on the results, Sharon Giordano, MD, of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said the outcome difference by menopausal status is intriguing but not definitive. \"Routine adjuvant use of zoledronic acid to prevent recurrence is not indicated,\" said Giordano. \"Bisphosphonates continue to have an important role in treating bone loss among women with breast cancer,\" she added. The results differed substantially from those of the Austrian Breast Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) XII trial, which showed a 36% improvement in the hazard for DFS after 48 months (N Engl J Med 2009; 360: 679-691). After an additional 14 months of follow-up, adjuvant endocrine therapy plus zoledronic acid maintained a significant advantage over endocrine therapy alone, Michael Gnant, MD, of Medical University of Vienna, reported at the news briefing. That trial involved 1,808 premenopausal women with stage I/II breast cancer. Following surgery, the patients were randomized to adjuvant hormonal therapy alone or with zoledronic acid. The primary endpoint was DFS. After a median follow-up of 62 months, 76 qualifying events had occurred in the zoledronic acid arm compared with 119 events in the patients randomized to endocrine therapy alone. The difference translated into a 32% reduction in the hazard in favor of zoledronic acid (HR 0.68, P=0.008). Analysis of overall survival demonstrated a trend in favor of the zoledronic acid arm (HR 0.67, P=0.143). \"Adding zoledronic acid to endocrine therapy for three years produced durable disease-free survival benefits and a strong trend towards improved overall survival,\" said Gnant. \"Zoledronic acid's anticancer benefits are consistent with the 'seed and soil' hypothesis. Bisphosphonates may modify the bone marrow microenvironment and thereby contribute to the disease-free survival results seen in and outside of bone.\" \"Combining zoledronic acid with adjuvant endocrine therapy should be considered for premenopausal women with early-stage endocrine-responsive breast cancer,\" Gnant added. The studies were supported by Novartis. Coleman disclosed relationships with Novartis and Amgen. Gnant disclosed a relationship with Novartis. Giordano had no disclosures. Primary source: San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium Source reference: Coleman RE, et al \"Adjuvant treatment with zoledronic acid in stage II/III breast cancer. The AZURE Trial (BIG 01/04)\" SABCS 2010; Abstract P5-11-02 Breastcancer.org's website discussion of the results: SABCS: Bone Drug Fails to Stop Breast Cancer Zometa (chemical name: zoledronic acid) is used to strengthen bones and lower the risk of fractures or other bone complications in women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the bones. Earlier studies suggested that Zometa also might help stop breast cancer from spreading to the bones by making it harder for breast cancer cells to grow in bones. Two studies are reviewed here. They both wanted to see if Zometa could reduce the risk of the cancer coming back in women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. One study, called the Austrian Breast Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) XII trial, suggested that treatment with Zometa and hormonal therapy after surgery could reduce the risk of recurrence in premenopausal women diagnosed with early-stage, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. The other study, called the Adjuvant Zoledronic Acid to Reduce Recurrence (AZURE) trial, found that treatment with Zometa after surgery didn't really reduce the risk of recurrence of in premenopausal women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Still, the AZURE study did suggest that Zometa might reduce the risk of recurrence in post-menopausal women. Because of these conflicting results, doctors don't agree on whether Zometa treatment makes sense for some women to reduce the risk of recurrence of early-stage breast cancer. In the ABCSG trial, 1,808 premenopausal women diagnosed with stage I or II hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer had surgery and then hormonal therapy to reduce recurrence risk. Half the women got Zometa with hormonal therapy and half got only hormonal therapy. About 4 years after surgery, the women who got Zometa and hormonal therapy had a 36% improvement in disease-free survival compared to the women who got only hormonal therapy. Doctors call the time a woman lives without the cancer coming back disease-free survival. After another year of follow-up, disease-free survival was 32% better in the women who got Zometa and hormonal therapy. Overall survival in the ABCSG trial -- the time a woman lived whether or not the cancer came back -- was 33% better in women who got Zometa and hormonal therapy. But this difference wasn't statistically significant, which means that it could have been due to chance and not because of the difference in treatments. In the AZURE trial, 3,360 women diagnosed with stage II or III breast cancer had surgery and then hormonal therapy and/or chemotherapy to reduce the risk of recurrence. Half of the women also got Zometa and the other half did not. About 5 years after surgery, the women who got Zometa and the women who didn't get Zometa had the same risk of recurrence overall. So Zometa didn't seem to affect disease-free survival in the AZURE trial. Still, when the researchers looked at premenopausal and post-menopausal women as separate groups, there were different results. Post-menopausal women who got Zometa had a 29% improvement in disease-free survival compared to post-menopausal women who didn't get Zometa. But this difference wasn't statistically significant, which means that it could have been due to chance and not because of the difference in treatments. There was no difference in disease-free survival in premenopausal women, whether or not they got Zometa. There were some important differences in these two studies, which may be why there are different results: Because doctors aren't sure if Zometa can improve disease-free survival in women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, it's not routinely used for that purpose at this time. Still, using Zometa and other bisphosphonates may make sense for post-menopausal women to strengthen bones that may be weakened by some breast cancer treatments. Bisphosphonates used to prevent or treat osteoporosis include: Reclast is given intravenously once a year. The others are pills taken by mouth. If you've been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, you may want to ask your doctor if a bisphosphonate makes sense for you. If you're a post-menopausal woman, your doctor may recommend a bisphosphonate to strengthen your bones or treat osteoporosis. Whether Zometa also can lower your risk of recurrence is unclear. If you're prescribed a bisphosphonate, know that some of them need to be taken in a specific way and all may cause serious side effects; make sure you and your doctor talk about how to take the medicine.",

I was also told before my surgery if they couldn't get the IV in my arm, they would put it in my neck. I had IVs In my neck before and it wasn't bad. With this surgery that I had a few weeks ago, they put a pain pump catheter in my neck and it was terrific! Looking back, I think my team did everything they could do to reduce my risk. At the end of the day, I needed surgery on my affected arm and I am doing well. Make sure you do your homework and don't agree to do anything unless you are comfortable.",

Most patients aren't aware that there is a range for each score and like you mentioned with the 10% mark usually being the number at which chemo is offered. Without a crystal ball, no one knows at this time where the range will tighten up. But I just wanted to be clear that at this time, the score at which chemo is being recommended has not changed despite TailorX lowering the bar. I also am glad that you were able to clarify what your doctor is doing and that it is based on her opinion only. I respect that, as every MO is entitled to their own opinion based on their own knowledge and experience. Furthermore, I respect how you based your own decision. I wish you well.",

      "Content": "Jul 8, 2011 08:43AM voraciousreader wrote: Breast cancer is a chronic and heterogeneous disease that may recur many years after initial diagnosis and treatment.1 This has important implications for the practicing oncologist. For instance, an early effect of adjuvant treatment may diminish                  over time after cessation of therapy, or, alternatively, there may exist a lag time before some treatment effects become pronounced.                  Indeed, the risk of breast cancer recurrence and death (hazard rate) varies over time (ie, is nonproportional) according to                  prognostic and predictive factors (Figs 1 and 2; Table 1).6,13 The hazard curve for breast cancer death peaks between 2 and 3 years after initial diagnosis and then declines sharply, suggesting                  that the biologic mechanisms responsible for early and late cancer-specific events are fundamentally different. Thus the early                  and late effects of adjuvant therapy may vary accordingly.               Annual hazard rates for breast cancer death and ER-negative to ER-positive hazard ratios (Table 1) using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 13 Registries Databases (1992 to 2007)                        for invasive female breast cancer.2 Annual hazard rates for breast cancer death overall (all cases combined, n = 401,693), estrogen receptor (ER) -negative (n                        = 74,567), and ER-positive (n = 257,426) breast cancers. The annual hazard rate for cancer-specific death describes the instantaneous                        rate of dying from cancer in a specified time interval after initial cancer diagnosis. Hazard rate curves were modeled using                        cubic splines with join-points selected by Akaike's information criteria3,4; 95% CIs were applied with bootstrap resampling techniques.5 Under the null hypothesis of no interaction over time, annual hazard rates for ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers                        would be proportional (or similar) with follow-up after initial breast cancer diagnosis. The overall rate of breast cancer                        death for all cases peaks near 3% per year between the second and third years after initial breast cancer diagnosis and then                        declines to 1% to 2% per year by the sixth through eighth years. The annual hazard rates for women with ER-negative and ER-positive                        tumors demonstrate peaks of approximately 6.5% and 2% near the first through third years after initial breast cancer diagnosis,                        respectively (> three-fold difference). An ER-negative to ER-positive hazard rate cross-over occurs between the seventh and                        eighth years after breast cancer diagnosis, and then women with ER-negative tumors had a somewhat paradoxically lower rate                        of breast cancer death than those with ER-positive breast cancers.                     Percent relapse-free survival (A, C, E) and annual hazard rates for breast cancer relapse (B, D, F) using data that was provided                        in supplemental Table 1 of Fan et al.6 Relapse-free survival in panels A, C, and E was obtained with the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator.7 Percent annual hazard rates for breast cancer relapse in panels B, D, and F were modeled as described in Figure 1.3,4 Plots for relapse-free survival and annual hazard rates for breast cancer relapse are shown for the intrinsic molecular subtypes                        (A, B),8 MammaPrint prognostic molecular signatures (C, D),9-11 and Oncotype DX prognostic scores (E, F).12 All plots demonstrate nonproportional relapse-free survival and nonproportional annual hazard rates for breast cancer recurrence.                        (A, B) Unsupervised hierarchal molecular clustering demonstrates two main breast cancer classes according to estrogen receptor                        (ER) expression and/or epithelial cell of origin (luminal or basal). There are two ER-negative (HER2 and basal-like) and two                        ER-positive (ie, luminal A and B) molecular signatures.8 Relapse-free survival is most favorable for luminal A and least favorable for non-luminal A tumors (luminal B, HER2 positive,                        and basal-like breast cancers). (C, D) MammaPrint is a dichotomous 70-gene prognostic signature.9-11 Relapse-free survival is most favorable for a good and least favorable for a poor molecular signature. (E, F) Oncotype DX                        is a 21-gene prognostic score.12 Relapse-free survival is most favorable for low and least favorable for intermediate and high molecular score.                     ER-Negative to ER-Positive HRs Over Time For example, Figure 1 shows the annual hazard rates for breast cancer deaths (percent per year) after initial diagnosis among women in the National                  Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 13 Registries database.2 The average annual rate of breast cancer deaths is nonproportional overall and by estrogen receptor (ER) expression.14 Thus the annual hazard rate for all cases peaks near 3% per year between the second and third years after diagnosis and then                  declines to 1% to 2% per year by the sixth through eighth years. The hazard rates for ER-negative and ER-positive tumors peak                  at approximately 6.5% and 2% per year, respectively, between the first and third years (ie, > three-fold difference). Notably,                  ER-negative to ER-positive hazard rates cross between the seventh and eighth years, after which women with ER-negative tumors                  have a lower rate of breast cancer death than those with ER-positive tumors. Table 1 further shows the fold difference for ER-negative compared with ER-positive tumors over time. ER-negative to ER-positive                  hazard ratios (HR) were more than 1.0 before the eighth year, after which HRs were less than 1.0.               Similar nonproportional hazard rates are evident for large versus small tumors, positive versus negative lymph nodes, high                  versus low tumor grade,13 the intrinsic molecular breast cancer subtypes,6,8 and the molecular prognostic signatures Oncotype DX12 and Mammaprint9-11 (Fig 2). Thus hazard rates for relapse among high-risk tumors (eg, nonluminal A, Mammaprint poor signature, and Oncotype high-risk                  score) show a sharp peak soon after initial diagnosis, similar to ER-negative cancers (Fig 1). Conversely, hazard rates for low-risk tumors (eg, luminal A, Mammaprint good signature, and Oncotype low- and intermediate-risk                  score) lack a sharp peak, similar to ER-positive tumors. These hazard curves suggest that the biologic mechanisms responsible                  for early and late breast cancer events differ and may therefore respond differently to the same treatment.               Although randomized clinical trials compare the outcomes of two treatment groups (and therefore two distinct hazard functions)                  over time,15 trial results are often summarized as a single value of the hazard ratio based on the Cox proportional hazards regression                  model.16 The underlying assumption is that the effect of an experimental treatment in comparison with that of a standard treatment                  is proportional over time. If an experimental treatment reduces the risk of recurrence by 25% at 3 years, then it is assumed                  to have the same proportional benefit throughout all other time points as well. Thus a 25% proportional benefit implies that                  the risk of recurrence is reduced from, say, 8% to 6% at year 3, 6% to 4.5% at year 4, 2% to 1.5% at year 6, and so on. Although                  the absolute benefit varies, the relative benefit (the hazard ratio) remains constant over time. In essence, the Cox model                  allows for estimation of a treatment effect without regard to any potential time-dependent fluctuations.               Yet there is now compelling evidence that commonly used adjuvant therapy regimens exert their effect primarily on the early                  hazard peak of recurrences and deaths (reducing the risk of events during the first 4 years after initial diagnosis). Jeong                  et al17 demonstrated nonproportional disease-free survival among patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen versus placebo, with treatment                  affecting primarily the early hazard peak. Similarly, data from the National Tumor Institute of Milan revealed that nearly                  all the beneficial effect of adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil  occurred during                  the initial 4 years after diagnosis.18 Additionally, analysis of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B and US Breast Cancer Intergroup data revealed that high-dose versus                  low-dose adjuvant cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil reduced the risk of an event (recurrence or death) by 55%                  in the first year and 30% in the second year, with no advantage after 3 years.19 Alternatively, there are now data suggesting that the benefit of adjuvant immunotherapy could occur later, if at all.20-22 Thus a breast cancer adjuvant immunotherapy trial may have a very different hazard ratio over time than the previous trials                  of adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy.               Further evidence of the nonproportional treatment effects for adjuvant therapy comes from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists                  Cooperative Group worldwide overviews.23 Table 2 (adapted from Fig 4 in the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Cooperative Group overview23) shows the average annual recurrence hazard ratio by follow-up intervals for women allocated to adjuvant polychemotherapy                  versus none. Although hazard ratios are lower (better) for women younger than 50 years than 50+ years for all time periods,                  the greatest impact of treatment occurs during the first 2 years among both younger and older women (P for time trend < .001). Treatment significantly reduces overall breast cancer mortality through 15 years of observation.                  However, the average overall effect on mortality ratios is less than that for recurrence, particularly among women in the                  older age group, and there is no statistically significant trend over time (P for time trend > .1).               Worldwide Overview Hazard Ratios for Breast Cancer Recurrence and Mortality for Selected Age Groups and Time Intervals After                        Diagnosis                     The popular simple log-rank test, which is identical to the score test from the Cox model when there is a single binary covariate,                  is optimal only when the proportional hazards assumption holds. If the log-rank test is used inappropriately for nonproportional                  hazards data, some loss of efficiency of the test is inevitable.24 In this case, an optimal weight function needs to be included in the log-rank test statistic, such as the Harrington-Fleming                  test.25 Statistical methods for dealing with nonproportional hazards using extensions of the Cox model or other parametric survival                  models have been available since the 1970s, although they are rarely used in the design or primary analysis of breast cancer                  trials.26 Several methods exist, including stratification of covariates with nonproportional effects, stratification of the time scale,                  incorporating time-varying covariates for treatment, or the fitting of parametric models.27,28 Also, the concept of frailty might be appropriate to address the issue of nonproportionality.24 In the frailty model, optimal weight functions for the log-rank test can be obtained from the distribution of an omitted                  covariate in the Cox model that induces the nonproportionality.24 In addition, there is a substantial risk of dying from non-breast cancer causes as the length of follow-up increases, and                  this should be considered in the development of survival models.29,30 To distinguish breast cancer-specific mortality from other causes of death, the concept of competing risks or a cure rate                  model could be used to estimate the proportion correctly.               The alternative methods in the preceding paragraph can also be problematic. For example, there can be lack of flexibility                  in using parametric methods, even though they can provide more accurate results as long as the assumed model fits the data                  well. Models with time-dependent covariates may suffer from unclear interpretation of the results, biases, and/or overfitting                  of the data set.31 Competing risk data are common, but the statistical methods for analysis should be chosen with caution. For example, if one                  is interested in inferring the proportion of breast cancer deaths, then the method should be based on the cumulative incidence                  function rather than the Kaplan-Meier survival curve.7,29 Also, designing a study with breast cancer mortality as the primary end point would entail larger sample sizes to meet the                  proposed true error probabilities for a competing risk model.               To fully elucidate the long-term effects of novel therapies, long-term follow-up of patients enrolled in breast cancer clinical                  trials might be necessary. Indeed, if early- and long-term treatment effects are nonproportional, then the early stoppage                  of clinical trials might obscure important late effects. Alternatively, some adjuvant treatments may only have early benefits,                  and longer follow-up may dilute those effects. Thus, when developing time lines for the primary analysis of particular trials,                  it is essential to consider scientific, statistical, and ethical issues, as well as practical concerns such as increases in                  cost.               Elucidation of the time-dependent effects of adjuvant therapy will become increasingly important in the years ahead as the                  number of long-term breast cancer survivors continues to increase. Given that the Cox proportional hazards methods generally                  ignore the potential time-dependent effects of adjuvant therapy, alternative models that incorporate concepts of breast cancer                  heterogeneity and competing risks of mortality should now be considered in the design, reporting, and interpretation of clinical                  trials.              ",

February 11, 2011 Listen to the Story Talk of the Nation In Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health, Dr. H. Gilbert Welch argues that modern medicine is looking too closely for disease, and that unnecessary screenings, MRIs and CT scans turn healthy people into diseased patients, by revealing often harmless abnormalities. Copyright © 2011 National Public Radio®. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. IRA FLATOW, host: Up next, for decades, one of the routine treatments for women with breast cancer has been not only to remove breast tissue but to cut out a large number of cancerous lymph nodes around the armpit also. But a new study out this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests that sort of extensive surgery may actually offer no benefit for some women with the early stage breast cancer. For women in this study with and without the operation but undergoing chemo and radiation, survival rates were very high, both of them, around 90 percent over five years. In this case, at least for about 20 percent of breast cancer patients, it appears that less is more, and they can do without the painful surgery, an example of overtreatment. But overtreatment isn't just a problem for patients diagnosed with cancer. It could sometimes be a problem for healthy people, as my next guest writes in his book \"Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health,\" because even healthy people are subject to more and more tests every time they visit the doctor. Think about it, what do you do? You get the normal tests. You get your cholesterol level, maybe your liver test if you're doing statins, you have a PSA, you have a body scan, tests that are often they often result in treatment. And because the traditional dogma is, as my next guest writes, more early diagnosis means better medical care, which means more treatment; and more treatment means better health. But is that traditional view true? Is it accurate? Should we still be thinking about it that way? Are all these tests and treatments actually improving our health or are we looking too hard for disease? Dr. H. Gilbert Welch is the author of \"Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health.\" He is professor of medicine at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, New Hampshire. He joins us from Vermont Public Radio. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Welch. Dr. H. GILBERT WELCH (Author, \"Overdiagnose: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health): It's great to be with you, Ira. FLATOW: Why is it because doctors can do all these diagnoses, all these tests that they do, do them? Dr. WELCH: Well, certainly, part of it is what's possible, and what's possible is, of course, changed dramatically over the last year. But it's also part of our ethos, if you will, that it's always a good thing to look for early forms of disease. And, of course, that message just been sent out to the public through the media and other sources that, of course, the thing you want to do is look for early forms of disease. But the truth is there are really two sides to the story. I think patients are used to thinking of treatments as having side effects, but so does testing. And the side effect of looking for early forms of disease is that we find, virtually, all of us have some. That's because we all harbor some abnormalities. And we never know which patients are those that have abnormalities that are going to cause problems in the future. So we tend to treat everybody we find with an abnormality and that means we're just treating some patients who can't benefit from our treatment because they were never going to develop the problem at hand if they're overdiagnosed. FLATOW: But how do you say to the person, you know, that maybe in the minority, as you say, that you may have saved that person's life by overdiagnosing them? Is that worth of maybe one in a hundred cases? Dr. WELCH: Well, I think that's the question we all need to face. And, you know, sort of, traditionally, doctors have focused on the one out of a thousand we might help by looking for early forms of disease. But we haven't really asked the question, what happens to the other 999? And this problem was really demonstrated to us in prostate cancer screening, which is really a poster child for the problem of overdiagnosis. 20 years ago, a simple blood test was introduced. And 20 years later, over one million Americans have been treated for a cancer that was never going to bother them. That test was the PSA, or prostate specific antigen. And it turned out an awful lot of men had abnormal PSAs. Many were found to have microscopic cancers far more than whatever suffer from prostate cancer. Now, you might say, does it matter? Yeah, sure it matters because most of these men were treated with either radical surgery or radiation. And roughly a third suffered side effects of treatment generally related to bowel, bladder or sexual function. Even a few have died from it. So this is a problem. It's a matter of finding the balance between the question of just how hard we should be looking for problems in well patients. FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow with H. Gilbert Welch. We're talking about overdiagnosis. He's the author of \"Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health.\" And I you know, you picked up on an interesting line there because prostate cancer is one of those things where people are now saying, you know, every man is probably going to have prostate cancer if he lives long enough sometime in his life. And maybe we should just be do watchful waiting instead of doing all that treatment for some people. Dr. WELCH: Well, I think that the question here is - before we get to the question of watchful waiting, at which point the patients already been told they have prostate cancer, I think we need to move back a step and recognize that the really important question is how hard to be looking and what different patients want. And I'm not arguing people shouldn't have PSA test. I'm arguing they should know both sides of the story. And I think different people in the exact same circumstance can make different decisions about it. FLATOW: And so you have opted out of the PSA test? Dr. WELCH: I certainly have. Just - first, there's a little bit of confusion about whether the test actually does do what it says it's suppose to do, which is to lower prostate cancer mortality. I believe it does. But I think you have to screen about a thousand men for a 10-year period annually for one to avoid a prostate cancer death. Now, that might seem like, sure, let's do it, if there was no downside to the process. But there is a downside to the process. Somewhere between a hundred to 200 hundred will have to biopsied over that period. And more concerning, somewhere between 30 and 50 will have to be treated for a cancer that was never going to bother them. Now that treatment, as I said before, you know, had some real side effects. About a third of men will have some sexual, bowel or bladder dysfunction. Now, for me, as I look at those numbers, I said, boy, that's not a very good deal. I'll stay away from it. I'll accept the fact that maybe I'm the one in a thousand that will be helped. But I don't want to make that mistake, somewhat more common side effect of being treated unnecessarily. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. WELCH: But it doesn't really matter what I think. It matters what patients think. And different patients may feel differently about it. And if they want to have prostate cancer screening, I'd say, go ahead. I just think people should know both sides of the story. FLATOW: All right. We're going to come back and talk more with Gilbert Welch, author of \"Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health.\" Our number: 1-800-989-8255. What do you think? Do you think you're getting too many tests at the doctor's office? Are you willing to forego some tests and maybe take your chances, thinking that, you know, it's not quite necessary? Give us a call: 1-800-989-8255. You can tweet us @scifri. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about overtreatment this hour. And just to let you know that we are keeping our eyes on the wires and what's going on in there at other parts of the world and keeping you up to date, especially about what's going on in the streets of Cairo, where there has been lots of jubilation following President Hosni Mubarak's stepping down from his post today and ceding all power to the military. Vice President and intelligence chief, Omar Suleiman, announced during an evening prayer that Mr. Mubarak had passed all authority to a council of military leaders. And President Barack Obama said, just a few moments ago, that the world has, quote, \"witnessed a true moment of history.\" And you can stay with NPR News throughout the day. We'll bring you up to date as things happen. Right now, we're talking about overdiagnosis with my guest, Gilbert Welch. He is author of \"Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health.\" Our number: 1-800-989-8255. When I go to my doctor, he takes, you know, vials of blood and he runs dozens of tests through them. Am I being foolish having all these tests done? Dr. WELCH: Well, it's certainly a relevant question. We've gotten much more sort of infatuated with sort of routine screening tests, and some of those tests are reasonable to consider. But one of the things you should know is that we've been consistently changing the rules about what constitutes abnormal. I'm talking now about conditions that are defined by numbers - things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and osteoporosis. All those diseases are defined by a number. If you're on the wrong side of that number, you have a condition. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. WELCH: If you don't - on the right side of the number, you don't. But the numbers we've used to define those diseases have changed over the last 20 years. And in each case, they've changed in the same direction, to label more Americans as abnormal. And that's happened for a number of reasons. One, it's sort of true belief that it's always good to identify more people at risk, sort of a language that people would use. But there's also a lot of money behind it because it is - the quickest way to expand a market for a drug is to expand the number of patients who are supposed to take the drug. And so there have been a lot of problems with conflicts of interest and physicians on these consensus panels that define these diseases. And that's just another dimension of the problem of overdiagnosis. This is labeling more people as abnormal, as needing treatment. And as you move into people who have milder and milder forms of a condition, fewer and fewer of them will actually go on to develop the feared consequence of the disease. But they still suffer the harms of treatment. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let's go to... Dr. WELCH: And so this is the kind of balance we have to think about more in this country, particularly since, you know, every day we get new tests. You know, you hear about a cancer test... FLATOW: Right. Ask your doctor. Dr. WELCH: ...that can find a single - yeah. FLATOW: Ask your doctor about this drug or this new test. Let's go to Dave in New York, New York. Hi, Dave. DAVE (Caller): Hi. Thanks for taking my call. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. DAVE: I just am curious as a patient whether or not physicians are guided by liability to categorize as much as they can about a particular patient. And as a patient who carries insurance, am I at risk of being dropped? Because now, all of a sudden, even though I'm asymptomatic, I've now been tagged with a potential problem. FLATOW: Is - are doctors over-testing because of liability? Are they afraid that if they don't, there's some liability there? Dr. WELCH: Well, David actually brings up two issues. Let's first deal with the malpractice issue, which all my colleagues would want me to mention, which is part of the problem. It's not all of the problem. We feel, as physicians, that we're punished for underdiagnosis, but there's no corresponding penalty for overdiagnosis. So that's totally a symmetric set of incentives and, of course, that pushes us to overdiagnose. But he also brings up another problem, which may, hopefully, will be fixed with health care reform, although I think it remains to be seen. And that is - there are downsides to having diagnoses. And one of the most immediate one for patients is - in the past, at least, and probably still currently - it does threaten your insurance. It may make it a lot more expensive to get insurance or you may not be able to get it at all. But there are other downsides for diagnosis. You know, just being given a diagnosis tends to - can affect people's self-perception of their own health. The truth is, you know, health is more than simply a physical state of being. It's more than simply the absence of all abnormality. It's also a state of mind. And it's hard to feel too well when doctors are constantly looking for things to be wrong. But the biggest problem with overdiagnosis is that it triggers overtreatment. And all of our treatments have harms. They range from the headaches of renewing prescriptions, scheduling appointments, subsequent testing, to the physical harms of the side effects of drugs, complications from surgery and even death. FLATOW: Thanks for calling. And some of the times, is it not the case that these treatments - you talked about overtreatment as being the real danger here - that doctors make money on those treatments? They might be happy to have that diagnosis because they've got a treatment they can give you that will make them money? Dr. WELCH: Yes. It's true that doctors make money on it, probably even more important, institutions make money on it. And now I'm thinking both about pharmaceutical companies and device manufacturers. And I'm also thinking about hospitals who have learned that disease screenings, free disease screenings, are a great way to recruit new patients. And that raises some huge ethical issues, whether this is the right thing for health care system to do is to be going out to look to identify in new patients who will then be paying patients. FLATOW: Let's go to David in San Antonio. Hi, David. DAVID (CALLER): Hi. As a prostate cancer survivor, I must say I generally agree with what you're saying about overdiagnosis. But the PSA, in general, just raised my ire and desire to call, because I feel like - I'm four years out from having prostate cancer and having the organ removed by robotic-assisted surgery, and I am totally happy that I did it. And if I had not been having the regular PSA test, which my physician recommended since age 45, established a baseline for what my normal was and saw an up-going trend. Mine had reached - it was 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, then the other year it was 2.3 and then 3.9. He said, well, you know, it's trending up. We better have you sent for a biopsy. I went in and saw the urologist, and he did the famous DRE and felt nothing. And said, well, we better schedule a biopsy anyway just to be sure because my finger isn't 100 percent accurate. And, well, a couple of weeks later, I had the biopsies as well. Make sure my people call you back. I don't see anything abnormal in the ultrasound that guides the probe nor in what we see so far. Well, bottom line, the following Friday, the doctor called me. And when the doctor calls you, it's not to give you good news. And basically, he said your Gleason score 3 plus 3 bilateral and (unintelligible) to remove it. And I had it removed. And I was very happy that I did. So my bottom line is I think the PSA is a very useful tool. It does not diagnose cancer. But in the long term, it - watch your trend, and it'll tell you something is going wrong in your personal case. FLATOW: Okay. Thanks for that testimonial. Gilbert? Dr. Welch, any - how do you react to that? Dr. WELCH: Sure. I hope David was helped by the test, and I'm glad he's doing well. That's great and that's important. The truth is most men found to have prostate cancer following a PSA are not helped by the test. Probably one out of 1,000 that have been screened for 10 years will be helped by the test. We believe that to be the case. But somewhere between 30 and 60 are treated unnecessarily. I hope he's not in that group but the chances are he is. And that's the problem with the - with early detection of, particularly, prostate cancer, but also thyroid and breast cancer. As we look for early forms of cancer, we recognize that virtually all of us harbor some early cancers. And we don't know which ones are ultimately going to be -matter, so we end up treating all of them. And that's the problem with looking for early forms of cancer. FLATOW: So what do you do? What kind of advice do you give to people who go in to their doctors for their checkups, their annual, their physicals? Do you say to your doctor, I don't need this test? Don't give me that test. I've done my homework. I shouldn't be having this. Are you telling your doctor what to do? Dr. WELCH: Well, I think the first thing people need to do is develop a little bit of healthy skepticism about the value of early diagnosis. I think, as a profession and the public health community, we've sort of systematically exaggerated the benefits of it. And we've either downplayed or totally ignored the harms. And it's time to be a little bit more open about both sides of the story, and the story is a complex one. It's a little counterintuitive. And that's why my colleagues and I wrote the book is so we could put it in one place, across the series of diseases, the problem of overdiagnosis. And then I think patients have to do a little bit of a sort of self-assessment. Where do they sit on the spectrum between wanting to pursue disease? Is that the way they want to go through life, looking for things to be wrong, always hoping that there'll be a chance that they'll be able to avoid some future outcome? Or - and they accept the fact that they maybe medicalized unnecessarily along the way. Or whether you want to go to the other extreme, which I call to pursue health, which is to live well while you're feeling well. Certainly, you see a doctor when you don't feel well. But recognize that you may miss some potential benefit of avoiding a rare cause of death, but you also avoid being medicalized prematurely. Now, I've drawn those as pretty discrete extremes. But I think this is a question we all have to address particularly as there are more and more tests and more and more ways we can look for things to be wrong within ourselves. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So you're saying the treatment may be worse than not doing anything at all? It's very... Dr. WELCH: It's not that - it's - I want to go back a step. It's before the treatment. It's the test. Because once you're tested, once you're told you're abnormal, I think you've already suffered some of the downsides of testing. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. WELCH: So, again, I want to be clear to your audience. I'm a conventionally-trained physician. I teach. I do research. I see patients. And I believe American medicine can do really good things for sick patients. The question is, how much to be involved with it when you are well. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. What don't we know about diagnosis? That it's heading in a right direction or new techniques? Are there new techniques that you think are welcome, that you're happy to see being developed, diagnostic techniques, or we just - we have enough already? Dr. WELCH: Oh, no. I think we're making a lot of advances. And, you know, so take CT scanning, for example... FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. WELCH: ...I mean, this is a way that - you know, it's been around 20 or 30 years, an MRI. It's a way we can now see the inside of the body in exquisite detail. It's been a great advance for us to evaluate people who are acutely ill and try to decide whether they have appendicitis or whether they're bleeding in their head or something. This is - there have been wonderful advances. The problem is, when you deploy them on a normal population, the well population, you also find a lot of abnormalities. Almost all of us harbor meniscal tears in our knee, whether or not we have knee pain. We have discs popping out of our back even - whether or not we have a back pain. So the problem is they identified so many abnormalities in normal people, you don't know what to do. But all of the pressures on us are to go ahead and to treat those people. FLATOW: I got you. Dr. Welch, thank you for taking time to be with us today, and good luck to you. Dr. WELCH: Well, thank you for having me. FLATOW: You're welcome. Dr. H.

AbstractObjective To estimate the extent of overdiagnosis (the detection of cancers that will not cause death or symptoms) in publicly organised screening programmes.Design Systematic review of published trends in incidence of breast cancer before and after the introduction of mammography screening.Data sources PubMed (April 2007), reference lists, and authors.Review methods One author extracted data on incidence of breast cancer (including carcinoma in situ), population size, screening uptake, time periods, and age groups, which were checked independently by the other author. Linear regression was used to estimate trends in incidence before and after the introduction of screening and in older, previously screened women. Meta-analysis was used to estimate the extent of overdiagnosis.Results Incidence data covering at least seven years before screening and seven years after screening had been fully implemented, and including both screened and non-screened age groups, were available from the United Kingdom; Manitoba, Canada; New South Wales, Australia; Sweden; and parts of Norway. The implementation phase with its prevalence peak was excluded and adjustment made for changing background incidence and compensatory drops in incidence among older, previously screened women. Overdiagnosis was estimated at 52% (95% confidence interval 46% to 58%). Data from three countries showed a drop in incidence as the women exceeded the age limit for screening, but the reduction was small and the estimate of overdiagnosis was compensated for in this review.Conclusions The increase in incidence of breast cancer was closely related to the introduction of screening and little of this increase was compensated for by a drop in incidence of breast cancer in previously screened women. One in three breast cancers detected in a population offered organised screening is overdiagnosed. IntroductionScreening for cancer may lead to earlier detection of lethal cancers but also detects harmless ones that will not cause death or symptoms. The detection of such cancers, which would not have been identified clinically in someone's remaining lifetime, is called overdiagnosis and can only be harmful to those who experience it.1 As it is not possible to distinguish between lethal and harmless cancers, all detected cancers are treated. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment are therefore inevitable.2It is well known that many cases of carcinoma in situ in the breast do not develop into potentially lethal invasive disease.1 In contrast, many find it difficult to accept that screening for breast cancer also leads to overdiagnosis of invasive cancer. Harmless invasive cancer is common, however, even for lung cancer, with 30% overdiagnosis after long term follow-up of patients screened by radiography.2 Autopsy studies have shown that invasive prostate cancer occurs in about 60% of men in their 60s, whereas the lifetime risk of dying from such cancer is only about 3%.2 Autopsy studies have also found inconsequential breast cancer lesions. Thirty seven per cent of women aged 40-54 who died from causes other than breast cancer had lesions of invasive or non-invasive cancer at autopsy, and half were visible on radiography.3 4Overdiagnosis can be measured precisely in a randomised trial with lifelong follow-up if people are assigned to a screening or control group for as long as screening would be offered in practice, which in most countries is 20 years. Overdiagnosis would be the difference in number of cancers detected during the lifetime of the two groups, provided the control group or age groups not targeted are not screened. In the absence of overdiagnosis the initial increase in cancers in the screened age groups would be fully compensated for by a similar decrease in cancers among older age groups no longer offered screening, as these cancers would already have been detected.The extent of overdiagnosis and overtreatment as a result of mammography screening was first quantified in reviews of randomised trials.5 6 The total number of mastectomies and lumpectomies increased by 31% and mastectomies by 20%.6 As these trials did not have lifelong follow-up the extent of overdiagnosis could have been overestimated. Underestimation is also possible, however, as the randomised design was maintained for only 4-9 years6 and as opportunistic screening occurred in the control groups.7Screening programmes differ from randomised trials. Radiologists outside a rigorous trial setting may be less well trained than those in the trial, and technical developments resulting in higher resolution images may also affect outcomes. The basic premise of an unchanged lifetime risk of breast cancer in the absence of overdiagnosis is, however, the same.To estimate the extent of overdiagnosis in organised screening programmes we compared trends in breast cancer incidence before and after screening, taking account of changes in the background incidence and any compensatory drop in incidence of breast cancer among older, previously screened women. We combined our results in a meta-analysis. MethodsWe included articles in any language with data on breast cancer incidence for both screened and older, non-screened age groups for at least seven years before screening and seven years after screening had been fully implemented, regardless of the time it took to implement screening. We reasoned that a long period after implementation was necessary to obtain an estimate of the trend in breast cancer incidence that was unaffected by the initial peak in prevalence when screening is introduced. Acquiring incidence data for age groups older than those screened allowed us to evaluate any compensatory declines in incidence among previously screened women.When a country was described in several papers we selected the one with the most recent and best reported data as our core article, and we supplemented with other papers when relevant. When possible we also added data from the internet and supplied by authors. We did not search for articles published before 1990, as insufficient time would have elapsed after the initiation of screening.Literature searchesOur searches in PubMed were developed iteratively and we tried several search strings. The final search, which identified all included articles, was: ((\"Mammography\"[MeSH] OR \"Mass Screening\"[MeSH]) AND ((\"Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology\"[MeSH]) OR (\"Breast Neoplasms\"[MeSH] AND incidence*[ti]))) OR (Breast cancer AND screening AND trend*[ti]) OR (Breast cancer AND screening AND overdiagnos*[ti]).One author scanned titles and abstracts and retrieved the full text of potentially relevant articles for evaluation of eligibility, scanned the reference lists, and contacted authors. We compared the final search with an archive of all articles on breast cancer screening published in 2004, which we have used for another study,8 and found that we had not missed any potentially relevant papers. None of the four authors we contacted told us of additional studies but three provided unpublished data or referred us to internet resources.9 We did not find additional studies in the reference lists.Data extractionBoth authors extracted data independently, with differences resolved by discussion. We extracted data on population size, screening uptake, length of time before and after the implementation of screening, and incidence of breast cancer for both screened and non-screened age groups. If data on carcinoma in situ were missing, we estimated overdiagnosis with these cases included, assuming that they would contribute 10% of the diagnoses in a population offered screening10 11-that is, we divided the incidence of invasive cancers by 0.9.Selection of last prescreening yearThe last prescreening year was usually the year before formal implementation of screening. If the levels of invasive breast cancer or carcinoma in situ appeared to increase abruptly in the years immediately before the introduction of screening, however, we excluded these years from estimates of trends before screening. Carcinoma in situ is rarely diagnosed without screening and such increases indicate opportunistic screening (screening outside the organised programme). Similarly, abruptly increased rates of invasive breast cancer immediately before formal implementation of screening likely indicate pilot programmes or extensive opportunistic screening.Calculation of overdiagnosis in absence of compensatory dropWe used simple linear regression to estimate trends as we could not use Poisson regression because the denominators for the reported rates of breast cancer were not available. To compensate for changes in background incidence in the screened age group we carried out a linear regression analysis of the prescreening years and extended this regression line to the last observation year. We used the calculated value for this year to estimate what the expected incidence would have been in the absence of screening.We did another linear regression analysis for the screened age group but used the observed incidence in that part of the screening period where the programme was fully implemented and past any prevalence peak. This was done to take account of annual fluctuations. The rate ratio between the result for the last observation year determined by linear regression and the expected incidence in that year (that is, the observed incidence in the last observation year divided by the expected incidence in the last observation year) constituted our estimate of overdiagnosis.Calculation of overdiagnosis in presence of compensatory dropIn the age group that exceeded the age for screening, we studied whether the observed increase in the incidence of breast cancer in the screening period was lower than the expected increase, in both cases using linear regression. If this was the case, we considered that the difference between the observed and expected incidence was due to a compensatory drop. We calculated the size of this drop as a rate ratio, as above, using the last observation year.From this rate ratio we calculated the absolute number of breast cancer cases per 100000 women that corresponded to the drop in the older age groups (X). Similarly, for the screened age groups we calculated the number of extra cases of breast cancer (those above the expected number) per 100000 women that corresponded to the increase (Y). We compensated for the many more women in the younger, screened age group (A) than in the older age group of previously screened women (B) using official population statistics to calculate a correction factor C=A/B.We calculated (Y×C-X)/(Y×C), which is the percentage of breast cancer cases uncompensated for of the total percentage increase in incidence among screened women. Overdiagnosis was then the observed percentage increase in incidence multiplied by the percentage of uncompensated for breast cancers (see Manitoba under Results for a numerical example).Women too young to be screenedIf available we used the group of women who were too young to be screened as a control to see if our extrapolated prescreening trend for the screened age group was a reasonable estimate of the background incidence, if screening had not been introduced. We did a linear regression analysis using the prescreening incidence, extrapolated the trend into the screening period, as for the other age groups, and compared with the observed incidence.Meta-analysisWe combined the estimates using Comprehensive Meta Analysis version 2.2.046 (random effects model). As we estimated overdiagnosis using only the last observation year, our estimate has wider confidence intervals than if we had used several observation years. We used population sizes and age distributions obtained from internet sources9 or as provided by the authors. ResultsThe PubMed search (May 2006) yielded 2861 titles, 2546 of which were not relevant (fig 1\u200b1).). The full text of the remaining 315 articles was evaluated for eligibility. Four were included as core articles and one was added when the search was updated in April 2007, presenting data from the United Kingdom; Manitoba, Canada; New South Wales, Australia; Sweden; and parts of Norway (table\u200b(table).12 13 14 15 16 (See web extra for data from an additional eight countries and reasons for exclusion.) United KingdomScreening started in the UK in 1988 for women aged 50-64, with national coverage by 1990, and was expanded to women aged 65-70 in 2002.17 Data from England and Wales covered 1971-99 in graphs with five year age groups.12 These data were combined and the prescreening period defined as 1971-84, before opportunistic screening had influenced the background incidence (fig 2\u200b2).). The period 1993-9 was used to estimate the most recent trend. The increase in incidence of invasive cancer in women aged 50-64 was 41% above the expected rate, interpreted as overdiagnosis as there was no compensatory drop in the older age groups (fig 2). The incidence in younger age groups (30-49 years) increased by 7% over expected rates and in older age groups (65-74 years) by 1% over expected rates. No data were available for carcinoma in situ, but assuming that 10% of the diagnoses in a population offered screening are for carcinoma in situ,10 11 overdiagnosis would be 57% (table). More recent data (1995-2003) have been published,17 but only for screened age groups. Incidence continues to increase.Manitoba, CanadaNo national data were found for Canada. In Manitoba, elective screening has been available since the late 1970s, with formal implementation in 1995 for women aged 50-69.13 A study compared incidence up to 1999.13 More recent data were received from the author (fig 3\u200b3).). As the incidence of carcinoma in situ started to increase in 1979, corresponding to the availability of elective screening, the prescreening period was defined as 1970-8. The period 1995-2005 was used to estimate the trend after screening. In the invited age group the incidence for invasive cancer was 35% above the expected rate, and when carcinoma in situ was included it was 59% higher. The total rate for the age group 70-84 was 15% below expected, but for the age group 35-49 it was 32% below expected, which suggests that causes other than screening could have contributed to the drop among previously screened women. In the last observation year the 59% increase (including carcinoma in situ) in women aged 50-69 corresponds to 140 extra breast cancer diagnoses per 100000 women, and the 15% decline in women aged 70-84 corresponds to 80 fewer breast cancer diagnoses per 100000 women. In Manitoba, 2.3 times as many women are aged 50-69 than are aged 70-84,9 and 75% (=(140×2.3-80)/(140×2.3)) of the increase is therefore uncompensated. A conservative estimate of overdiagnosis is therefore 59%×75%=44%.New South Wales, AustraliaNational data on prescreening rates were not presented for Australia.18 The introduction of screening varied from state to state, and follow-up was short.For New South Wales, where screening was introduced during 1988-95, a graph showed an increase of 55% for invasive cancer over expected rates in women aged 50-69.14 When the prescreening period was defined as 1972-87 and the period 1996-2002 was used to estimate the trend after screening, this age group showed an increase of 38% over expected rates (fig 4\u200b4).). Among women too young to be screened the increase in incidence was constant (fig 4). Women aged more than 70 were eligible but not targeted. No compensatory drop was observed; the incidence was in fact larger than expected. Overdiagnosis including carcinoma in situ was therefore estimated at 53% (table). A similar development was seen in South Australia, but the prescreening period was indicated as one data point, which precluded estimation of prescreening trends.19SwedenWomen in a few areas of Sweden participated in screening trials from 1969; nationwide screening started in 1986, and in 1998 almost all eligible women had been offered screening.20 For various counties in 1999, eight different targeted age ranges were described20; the broadest was 40-74 years and the most common was 50-69 years. A study reported an increase in invasive cancer after screening of 69% above expected rates in women aged 50-59 and 27% in women aged 60-69.15 After adjustment for lead time, with estimates varying from 1.6 to 3.0 years, the increases in 2000 were 54% and 21%, respectively.15 Another report21 showed similar increases, without a compensatory drop in older age groups, whereas a third report noted a drop in incidence of 12% in those aged more than 75, and no change for women aged 70-74.22Data up to 2006 were received from one of the authors (fig 5\u200b5).22 The meta-analysis focused on the age group 50-69, as this is the only group offered screening in all regions. Using the prescreening period as 1971-85 and the period 1998-2006 to estimate the trend after screening, the estimated increase for invasive cancer over expected rates was 35%, or 86 additional breast cancers per 100000 women in the last observation year. A constant increase in incidence was seen among women too young to be screened (fig 5). A drop occurred among women aged 70-84, but incidence approached the expected rate at the end of the observation period (fig 5). In the middle of the interval after screening had started in 1998, 10% fewer invasive breast cancers were detected than expected, or 35 fewer cancers per 100000 women. Eighty eight per cent of the increase was therefore uncompensated. Despite using data when the compensatory decline was largest (rather than from the last observation year), this adjustment only changed the estimate of overdiagnosis for invasive breast cancer from 35% to 31%. When carcinoma in situ was included overdiagnosis was 46% (table). NorwayScreening was introduced in Norway in 1995-6 for women aged 50-69, but only in 40% of the population (Akershus, Oslo, Rogaland, and Hordaland counties; fig 6\u200b6),), and in the rest of Norway from 1999, gaining national coverage in 2004 (fig 7\u200b7).16 Attendance was good (75-77%).16 22 As screening was fully implemented in the other counties in 2004, overdiagnosis was not estimated for these areas, although the data are presented graphically for comparison (fig 7). In Akershus, Oslo, Rogaland, and Hordaland, a peak in prevalence for invasive breast cancer was followed by stable levels, above prescreening rates in the screened age group.16 22 Screening is generally offered to women aged 50-69, but about 50% of those aged 70-74 were probably screened,23 and incidence initially increased by 30% in this age group and then decreased to prescreening levels. The incidence in women aged 20-50 and more than 74 was stable. Another study reported similar increases but had shorter follow-up.22 Additional data were received from one of the authors.22 The age group 50-69 years was considered as screened. The prescreening period was defined as 1980-94 and the period 2000-6 was used to estimate the trend after screening. The increase in invasive breast cancer was estimated as 42% above expected rates, or 90 additional breast cancers per 100000 women in the last observation year. Among women too young to be screened the increase in incidence was constant, but data for this group were only available divided into counties from 1991 (fig 6). A 15% drop was seen among women aged 70-79, but a similar drop was also observed in the rest of Norway before screening was fully implemented (fig 7). The drop was conservatively considered as compensatory. The 15% fewer invasive breast cancers correspond to 43 fewer cancers per 100000 women. This means that 86% of the increase was uncompensated for, or that overdiagnosis was 37%. When carcinoma in situ was included overdiagnosis was 52% (table).Meta-analysisThe total overdiagnosis of breast cancer in publicly available mammography screening programmes (including carcinoma in situ) was 52% (95% confidence interval 46% to 58%; fig 8\u200b8).). Heterogeneity was moderate (I2=59%). DiscussionIn populations offered organised screening for breast cancer, overdiagnosis (the detection of cancers that do not cause death or symptoms) was 52%. Carcinoma in situ was included in this estimate, as it is generally treated in the same way as invasive breast cancer1 2 24; the overdiagnosis for invasive breast cancer only was 35% (95% confidence interval 29% to 42%).We took account of the increasing background incidence by comparing the observed rates of breast cancer with the expected rates for the last year of observation, using projected incidence rates from prescreening trends. Our assumption of a constant, linear increase in the background incidence was supported by data from age groups that were too young to be screened, as agreement between projected and observed rates was good (figs 2-5). Another indication that our assumption was reasonable is that the incidence of breast cancer only deviated from a linear increase around the time of the introduction of screening. This was the case in all included areas, even though screening was introduced at different times (from 1979 in Manitoba to 1995 in Norway). It is therefore unlikely that changes in risk factors or cohort effects could explain the non-linear increases in incidence of breast cancer that occurred with the introduction of screening.Manitoba had substantial opportunistic screening before organised screening was introduced,13 but we avoided this bias by estimating the prescreening trends from periods when there were few diagnoses of carcinoma in situ.The trend after implementation of screening was estimated under the assumption that screening leads to a higher incidence level that increases at about the same rate as the background incidence did before screening.25 Our data support this assumption (figs 2-6).As we have data on long follow-up it is unlikely that the increasing incidence in the screened age group will be compensated for later on. Screening theory implies that a compensatory drop would be apparent shortly after women leave the screening programme and thus after comparatively short follow-up.25Not all women in all areas passed from the screened age group to the previously screened age group within our observation period. In England and Wales, however, practically all women aged 65-74 would have been offered screening previously at the end of our observation period, but we did not find a compensatory drop in incidence of breast cancer (fig 2).Some authors use statistical models to adjust their estimate of overdiagnosis for lead time (increased incidence because of advancement of the time of diagnosis).26 27 28 29 30 This approach is problematic as all models carry a high risk of bias31 because they are based on unverified assumptions, and as the choice of variables is crucial-for example, high estimates of lead time result in low estimates of overdiagnosis.31 Estimates of lead time varied between 1.6 and 4 years and even differed in articles by the same authors.15 26 27 29 30The recent decline in the use of hormone replacement therapy after evidence that it causes breast cancer32 is a possible explanation for the reduction in incidence observed in the United States from 2002, in particular as such a decline did not occur in women below 50 years of age.33 We did not, however, see similar declines in the countries we examined, and the declining use of mammography screening in the United States has also been suggested as an explanation.34In Norway the effect of screening was separated from that of hormone replacement therapy use, as incidence trends in regions with and without screening could be compared at the same calendar times. Although use of hormone replacement therapy is likely to be similar, a noticeable increase occurred in invasive cancer with the introduction of screening, both in the Akershus, Oslo, Rogaland, and Hordaland counties and in the remaining counties of Norway (figs 6 and 7), and in the other regions we examined (figs 2-4).ConclusionWe estimated 52% overdiagnosis of breast cancer in a population offered organised mammography screening-that is, one in three breast cancers is overdiagnosed.What is already known on this topic What this study adds",

The patients who are participating in the SOFT trial are at low risk of recurrence.  The early word coming out of the trial is that there have been fewer recurrences than what they expected.  It seems reasonable to think that once TailorX is reported, there might be fewer recurrences as well and that might be good news as well. Maybe many more intermediate  patients will find themselves pushed into the low OncotypeDX range.  Now that would be very good news!",

      "Content": "Nov 22, 2011 10:33PM voraciousreader wrote: According to the National Cancer Institute: Clinical Breast Examination No randomized trials of clinical breast examination (CBE) as a sole screening modality have been done. The Canadian National Breast Screening Study compared CBE plus mammography to CBE alone in women aged 50 to 59 years (refer to the Effect of Screening on Breast Cancer Mortality section of this summary for more information). CBE was conducted by trained health professionals with periodic evaluations of performance quality. The frequency of cancer diagnosis, stage, interval cancers, and breast cancer mortality were similar in the two groups and compared favorably with other trials of mammography alone. One explanation for this finding was the careful training and supervision of the health professionals performing CBE.[56] Breast cancer mortality with follow-up 11 to 16 years after entry (mean = 13 years) was similar in the two screening arms (mortality rate ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.78-1.33]).[57] The investigators estimated the operating characteristics for CBE alone. For 19,965 women aged 50 to 59 years, sensitivity was 83%, 71%, 57%, 83%, and 77% for years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the trial, respectively, and specificity ranged between 88% and 96%. PPV, which is the proportion of cancers detected per abnormal examination was estimated to be 3% to 4%. For 25,620 women aged 40 to 49 years, who were examined only at entry, the estimated sensitivity was 71%, specificity 84%, and PPV 1.5%.[58] Among community clinicians, screening CBE has higher specificity (97%-99%) [59] and lower sensitivity (22%-36%) compared with examiners in clinical trials of breast cancer screening.[60-63] A study of screening in women with a positive family history of breast cancer showed that, after a normal initial evaluation, the patient or CBE identified more cancers than did mammography.[64] Another study examined the usefulness of adding CBE to screening mammography. Among 61,688 women older than 40 years and screened by mammography and CBE, sensitivity and specificity for mammography and for combined mammography-CBE were calculated. Specificity for mammography was 78% and for both modalities 82%. The increased sensitivity was greatest for women aged 60 to 69 years with dense breasts (6.8%), compared with women aged 60 to 69 years with fatty breasts (1.8%). Specificity was lower for women undergoing both screening modalities compared with mammography alone (97% vs. 99%).[65] The duration of examination in the trials was 5 to 10 minutes per breast. Breast Self-Examination Monthly breast self-examination (BSE) is frequently advocated, but evidence for its effectiveness is weak.[66,67] The only large, well-conducted, randomized clinical trial of BSE that has been completed, randomly assigned 266,064 women according to workplace in Shanghai to receive either BSE instruction, reinforcement and encouragement, or instruction on the prevention of lower back pain. Neither group received breast cancer screening through other modalities. After 10 to 11 years of follow-up, 135 breast cancer deaths occurred in the instruction group and 131 in the control group (relative risk [RR] = 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82-1.33). Although the number of invasive breast cancers diagnosed in the two groups was about the same, women in the instruction group had more breast biopsies and more benign lesions diagnosed than did women in the control group.[68]  Case-control studies, nonrandomized trials, and cohort evidence about the effectiveness of BSE is mixed; results are difficult to interpret because of selection and recall biases. For example, a small case-control study in Seattle, Washington, compared self-reported practice of BSE in women with advanced breast cancer with that in age-matched controls.[69] The frequency of practicing BSE did not differ in these groups, and there was no decrease in the risk of advanced-stage breast cancer associated with BSE (RR = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.73-1.81). BSE proficiency was low in both groups of women.  In the U.K. Trial of Early Detection of Breast Cancer, two districts invited more than 63,500 women aged 45 to 64 years to educational sessions about BSE. After 10 years of follow-up, there was no difference in mortality rates in these two districts compared with four centers without organized BSE education (RR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.93-1.22).[70]  A case-control study nested within the Canadian NBSS suggests that well-performed BSE may be effective. This study compared self-reported BSE frequency before enrollment in the trial with breast cancer mortality. Women who examined their breasts visually, used their finger pads for palpation, and used their three middle fingers had a lower breast cancer mortality.[71]  A device called the Sensor Pad was designed to improve the accuracy of BSE and has been approved by the FDA; however, there is no evidence on its efficacy to decrease breast cancer mortality.

Once you have surgery, then you should receive a final pathology report indicating the stage and biology of the tumor. If your tumor is early stage, fewer than 3 nodes positive, ER + and HER2 negative, you can have genetic testing of the tumor to determine if you need chemo.  Now, with respect to being grade 1, the biopsy can sometimes give you that info. But it will not be confirmed until the surgical pathology testing is completing. Now, having waited six months, I wouldn't worry too much. If it is a grade 1 tumor, it probably has been growing for a long time. If confirmed as grade 1, you will probably have an excellent prognosis which means you will have many good treatment choices.  Finally, any additional imaging that you have pre surgery will help both you and the surgeon in deciding what surgical options you may consider.  You are at the early stage of treatment. It may take a few more weeks until you have a treatment plan that works for you. Now is the time to read the NCCN breast cancer treatment guidelines. Register at their website so you can familiarize yourself with the treatment guidelines. Remember, the guidelines should be a starting point in your discussions...  Good luck",

The reason why I am telling you this is that once you have these types of tests, the company can potentially garnner lots of propritary info about you. That said, once you agree to have the test, the company is in a position to learn so much about you in addition to whatever they learn and you learn about your genes. Perhaps you can use that piece of info as a bargaining chip towards getting them to give you a discount...",

The utility of the test permits doctors to hone in on the prognostics and then make an educated guess. Rgruff mentions the effects of diet and exercise with regard to recurrence. Again, we can use meta - analysis for clues to how effective therapies are, but at the end of the day, doctors still cannot predict whether or not any therapy will eradicate a tumor.

As the effect was lowest in the adequately randomised trials, a reasonable estimate is a 15% reduction corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 0.05%. Screening led to 30% overdiagnosis and overtreatment, or an absolute risk increase of 0.5%. This means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will have her life prolonged and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress for many months because of false positive findings. It is thus not clear whether screening does more good than harm. To help ensure that the women are fully informed of both benefits and harms before they decide whether or not to attend screening, we have written an evidence-based leaflet for lay people that is available in several languages on www.cochrane.dk.",

      "Content": "Nov 23, 2011 12:14AM voraciousreader wrote: Editorial 11/22/11  Journal of The National Cancer Institute: Since the National Cancer Institute developed the first guidelines on mammography screening over thirty years ago, advocacy                  and professional groups have developed guidelines focused on who should be screened, instead of communicating clearly the                  risks and benefits of screening, according to a commentary by Michael Edward Stefanek, Ph.D., the associate vice president                  of collaborative research in the office of the vice president at Indiana University, published online Nov. 21 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Stefanek writes that too much time has been spent debating guidelines, instead of ongoing debates about who should be screened.                  He advocates educating people about the potential harms and benefits of screening.               The U.S. Preventative Task Force (USPTS) recommendations against routine mammography for women aged 40-49 sparked controversy                  followed by more studies on screening, notably a Norwegian study comparing cancer-specific mortality in screened and unscreened                  women, which found a small and statistically insignificant breast cancer mortality reduction in the screened group. Stefanek                  writes that \"similar ambiguity\" exists for prostate cancer screening, noting that the two largest and high quality studies                  gave conflicting results, with the USPTS recently issuing recommendations against PSA testing in healthy men. The National                  Lung Cancer Screening Trial reported a 20% relative decrease in lung cancer deaths among subjects undergoing CT scans compared                  with those receiving chest x-rays, but with the majority of positive results being false positives. Overall this situation                  leads Stefanek to the conclusion that despite all the analyses to date, we are on unsteady ground when we attempt to dictate                  who should and shouldn't undergo screening.               Stefanek poses the question of what we have taught the public about cancer screening, since the public invariably seems to                  feel that screening is almost always a good idea and that finding cancer early is the key to saving lives. He cautions that                  the public may persist in holding a biased view of screening if we continue to engage in guideline debates. Furthermore, new                  technologies, despite the potential for combating cancer, will likely result in false positives, false negatives, overtreatment,                  and under treatment, and incur important patient harms.               Stefanek writes that we have failed to truly educate the public about cancer screening, and that our approach to screening                  needs to be reformed. He says engaging patients in shared decision making, tracking the number of patients provided with information                  related to the harms and benefits of screening instead of just those who are screened, and uniting scientific and advocacy                  organizations with primary care provider organizations in this effort to inform about costs and benefits is needed. \"If we                  agree on the premise that individuals are supposed to be informed before making medical decisions, including decisions about                  cancer screening, then the time and talent of such groups could be much better spent educating the public on the harms and                  benefits of cancer screening,\" Stefanek writes. \"Screening can be very beneficial (or not), and screening messages should                  reflect the complexity of this decision.\"              ",

The NCI funding will allow the team, led by Perelman School of Medicine faculty Katrina Armstrong, MD, MSCE, chief of the division of Internal Medicine and associate director of Outcomes and Delivery in the Abramson Cancer Center, and Mitchell Schnall, MD, PhD, Matthew J. Wilson Professor of Radiology, to use clinical, genomic and imaging information to guide the use of novel, personalized breast cancer screening strategies that will reduce false positive rates to improve outcomes.\" The research, which also involves researchers from medical oncology, psychiatry, and colleagues in the Annenberg School for Communication and the Wharton School, will be conducted through August 2016. PCIPS research is three-fold. First, they will aim to improve breast cancer screening by creating a new \"breast complexity index\" to predict individual screening outcomes. Second, the team will also compare the effectiveness of new imaging technology, including digital breast tomosynthesis compared to conventional mammography. Third, they will create new strategies for communicating individual estimates of benefit and risk of alternative screening methods to better inform patients and health care providers.    Along with these three projects, the Center will study outcome data of a diverse group of 74,000 women who undergo breast cancer screening at six sites in Penn Medicine's integrated health network. The center will use resources in breast imaging, primary care, communication, computer science, biostatistics, health services research, bioinformatics, medical oncology, cancer genetics and clinical leadership to advance the breast cancer screening process and encourage collaboration through NCI's Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) network.",

A few things to note first: Something to keep in mind: Since some people seem to be a mosquito magnet while others around them don't get a single bite, I have the suspicion that there could be a personal body chemistry factor involved. And that could explain why a remedy that works for one person, may not work for another. I suspect that's why some people swear by the Bounce sheet method, or the Avon Skin So Soft solution, while others have a different experience. Bounce nor the Avon SSS did a thing for me btw, but I did include them in the list below. I know a few people who SWEAR by them. Basics for Mosquito Bite Prevention Mosquito Bite Prevention Home Remedies & Tips Plants That Repel Mosquitoes Break off leaves and crush them roughly, rub them all over your clothes and skin.

I think the takeaway message is that, as good as the test is, a good medical oncologist should be able to put ALL of the prognostics together and help you come up with a treatment plan.  Furthermore, at the end of the day, there are some women who will want to take more risks to get a 1% benefit of chemo, while others might want more benefit before agreeing to chemo. I ended up getting THREE opinions.  I saw two oncologists who were highly recommended and I also was lucky enough to have the opinion of a niece who is an oncologist as well.  I was very lucky that all three agreed with the plan.  Would someone else in my shoes, with my scores and prognostics done the same?  I have NO idea.  If you have any doubts about your treatment plan, then by all means, get a second or even a third opinion, make your decision and move on.  I'm a few months away from my active treatment and now beginning to be \"comfortable\" with my decision.  Only time will tell if I made the right decision.

No side effects. No downside. It took him TWO LONG years to get into the habit of packing a food bag. I asked his doctor what the problem with being compliant was? He told me that the DH was like so many of his patients. It was very frustrating because patients like my husband would end up hospitalized and catastrophically ill.

FDA class labeling for hypnotics prior to 2005 implicitly recommended short treatment duration; since 2005, hypnotic labeling does not address duration of treatment. Antidepressants and other drugs commonly used off-label for treatment of insomnia also carry no specific restrictions with regard to duration of use. In clinical practice, hypnotic medications are often used over durations of one to twelve months without dosage escalation,52-55 but the empirical data base for long-term treatment remains small. Recent randomized, controlled studies of non-BZD-BzRAs (such as eszopiclone or zolpidem) have demonstrated continued efficacy without significant complications for 6 months, and in open-label extension studies for 12 months or longer.For many patients, an initial treatment period of 2-4 weeks may be appropriate, followed by re-evaluation of the continued need for treatment. A subset of patients with severe chronic insomnia may be appropriate candidates for longer-term or chronic maintenance treatment, but, as stated, the specific defining characteristics of these patients are unknown. There is little empirical evidence available to guide decisions regarding which drugs to use long-term, either alone or in combination with behavioral treatments. Thus, guidelines for long-term pharmacological treatment need to be based primarily on common clinical practice and consensus. If hypnotic medications are used long-term, regular follow-up visits should be scheduled at least every six months in order to monitor efficacy, side effects, tolerance, and abuse/misuse of medications. Periodic attempts to reduce the frequency and dose in order to minimize side effects and determine the lowest effective dose may be indicated.\"",

Furthermore, your Oncotype DX score indicates a small chance of recurrence and that the risks of chemo outweigh the benefits. The Oncotype DX genetic test was developed because physicians and researchers knew that many patients were being over treated with chemo. But they didn't know exactly who was over treated. Tests like the Oncotype DX test were developed so more patients could be spared the risks that accompany chemo while offering little or no benefit. I suggest that you get a second or even third opinion so you will be more comfortable moving forward. Good luck!",

Since my diagnosis of a rare invasive breast cancer, I have followed the NCCN guidelines issued since my diagnosis as well as including several years BEFORE my diagnosis looking for differences in the recommendations and trends.  What I have found is, pretty much, a moving target depending on what year I focus in on. Recommendations are fluid and DO change based on small amounts of evidence. Since my diagnosis, the treatment for my disease has become more lax.  One word changes from year to year, lead to different options.   When I was diagnosed, the word \"recommend\" was used with regard to endocrine therapy.  Whereas today, the word \"consider\" is used.  For my type of breast cancer, mucinous, there is no mention of the use of the Oncotype DX test.  Whereas in 2011, the NCCN guidelines first \"recommended\" it's use for other invasive breast cancers.  Most evidence for treating mucinous breast cancer is extracted from studies on traditional IDC or from SEER retrospective analysis.  Because it is so rare and carries a \"favorable\" prognosis, there is little money for research making treatment plans that much harder to make because of the lack of clinical trial evidence.  Most of the \"evidence\" to treat mucinous breast cancer is based on level 2b evidence. So, if all clinicans depended on the level of evidence you describe to make a treatment recommendation for mucinous breast cancer, then NONE of them would be able to make a recommendation.  I think your perspective as a researcher blinds you from seeing what happens in clinical practice.  From reading threads here for many years, patients often come here asking questions about gray areas....which there are MANY!  Basically, a clinician needs to look at the characteristics of the patient's tumor, look at the \"evidence\" and then look at the patient and make a recommendation regarding treatment deciding at what point the risks of treatment outweigh the benefits for that patient. Researchers, like yourself, and clinicians have known for a very long time that they were over treating patients.  Without researchers and bold physicians who knew that lumpectomy and NOT mastectomy was feasable, we'd still be offering women no option.  But in the last 40 years, breast cancer treatment has improved greatly to the point where researchers and clinicians are looking at the benefit of \"less\" being \"more.\"  The reason why we now have genomic tests like the Oncotype DX test and lumpectomies is because DESPITE what we DON'T know about breast cancer, there's A LOT more little things that are learned each day, week, month and year that yield treatment plans that eventually lead to Category 1 guidelines.  Those guidelines do not occur in a neat fashion...but rather inch forward very sloppily. According to the 2012 NCCN breast cancer treatment guidelines found on page 10, although Category 2b, it says that lumpectomy without radiation is an option.  I don't think they would write that into the guidelines if it wasn't meaningful.  It appears that for \"low risk\" patients, it is an option. I think challenging the evidence, as a researcher is a good thing.  However, for a patient and their physician it is a different ball game.  With that said, I'm THRILLED that the NCCN breast cancer treatment guidelines are updated each year and are more than 100 pages long.  It shows how long and sloppy research is and yet how it leads to options....and that's a very good thing!",

After being on this discussion board for three years I no longer accept the word \"until\" in my vocabulary.  Every day patients and their clinicians have to make treatment decisions based on whatever evidence is available.  And in my humble opinion, the recommendation of deferring radiation would NOT have been written into the guidelines unless there was evidence whether or not it is \"the norm.\"    I've come to realize from sisters who came before me and after, that the best clinicians will discuss with their patients ALL of the evidence and then let the patient decide what's best for them. Ultimately, that should be \"the norm.\"",

Having watched Dr. Gupta's interview, I really wonder what he thought.  Could he have been thinking the same thing that I was thinking?  If the journalist interviewing me is such a moron about breast cancer, does my 4 minute interview matter in the scheme of things?   And finally, I will leave you all with this thought.  Where was Komen when Lunden and Harris announced that mammograms failed them?  Couldn't they have used those moments as teaching moments?  Their silence is deafening...  Sadly, we know better!  Shall I say it again?  Okay!  We need better screening, better treatments and a cure!",

There are many women who don't come here because they are doing well and haven't a need to enlighten themselves. So, using the women here as an example is truly skewed.

My friend who has high blood pressure was NOT compliant in taking her medication.  She takes a few meds and supplements on MOST days.  I didn't know she was non-compliant until one Sunday evening, when her husband was on a business trip, I had to take her to the emergency room because her blood pressure was dangerously high.  While being examined by the nurse, she explained that she wasn't compliant with taking her blood pressure medication, because she often got reflux from taking her medications in the morning.  If she didn't take her medication in the morning, usually by afternoon, she would forget to take them.  So, both the nurse and I looked at her and both of us started to say to her, \"TAKE THE BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION AS SOON AS YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING. Then, during the course of the day, as you put food in your stomach, take the rest of your medications and supplements.\" Well, guess what?  It's been a few months now and my friend has been compliant and hasn't gotten the reflux and remembers to take her blood pressure medication and she is well. So, Cycle-Path...I don't think the authors of the study were THAT moronic.  They recognize that patients are less than compliant.  It is their responsibility as researchers to figure out WHY people are non-compliant and look for solutions.  But I applaud them for RECOGNIZING that there is a problem.  And while the reason why, for some patients who might NOT be taking their medication, is because they don't like the side effects, OR that the benefits of taking it might be minimal at best, the problem deserves ATTENTION and solutions need to be found.  And I totally agree with you that for some women, the amount of benefit from taking Tamoxifen might be minimal and the side effects so terrible that they're just not going to take it no matter what anyone tells them.  Quality of life is equally important.  But, it's also important to understand why people aren't compliant with taking their medications and finding ways to mitigate, if possible, their lack of compliance.  And for many people, including my girlfriend, there are very simple ways to be compliant. ",

Further, the low rate of breast cancer deaths indicates that breast cancer mortality is not a major concern for this subset of older women.\"",

[Zoledronic Acid Sinks as Breast Cancer Therapy in AZURE Trial] Updated results for the ABCSG (Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group) Trial 12 continue to show disease-free and overall survival benefits 2 years after stopping adjuvant endocrine treatment with zoledronic acid (Zometa), according to an update presented at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. The positive Austrian trial randomized 899 premenopausal women on goserelin (Zoladex) to 3 years of zoledronic acid with either tamoxifen or anastrozole (Arimidex) and 904 comparators to endocrine therapy alone (N. Engl. J. Med. 2009;360:679-91). At a median follow-up of 62 months (2 years after treatment completion), zoledronic acid reduced the risk of disease-free survival events by 32%, compared with endocrine therapy alone (hazard ratio, 0.68; P = .008). Better disease-free survival was seen whether the women were on tamoxifen (HR, 0.67) or anastrozole (HR, 0.68). A trend toward reduced risk of death with zoledronic acid also endured (HR, 0.67; P = .09). \"We observed persistence of benefit with adjuvant zoledronic acid in the ABCSG-12 trial,\" said Dr. Michael Gnant, president of the ABCSG, at the press briefing where Dr. Robert Coleman reported no disease-free survival benefit overall (adjusted HR, 0.98; P = .79) from adjuvant zoledronic acid in the AZURE (Adjuvant Treatment With Zoledronic Acid in Stage II/III Breast Cancer) trial. \"Why are the ABCSG-12 results so different from the premenopausal [women] in AZURE?\" asked Dr. Gnant, professor of surgery at the Medical University of Vienna. \"I believe that when you look closely, there is minimal overlap in patient selection and treatment,\" he said. \"All of them [in the ABCSG-12 trial] were put into artificial menopause for 3 years with the use of goserelin. None of these patients had adjuvant chemotherapy. I think that's an important difference from the AZURE trial,\" said Dr. Gnant. In the AZURE trial, 96% of patients had adjuvant chemotherapy, and none got ovarian function-suppression treatment. Also, in the ABCSG-12 trial, about 70% of patients had low-risk, stage I breast cancer. Patients in the AZURE trial had stage II or III breast cancer. Patients in the ABCSG-12 trial were randomized to one of four treatment groups: 20 mg/day tamoxifen; 20 mg/day tamoxifen plus 4 mg zoledronic acid every 6 months; 1 mg/day anastrozole; or 1 mg/day anastrozole plus 4 mg zoledronic acid every 6 months. Treatment lasted for 3 years. All patients received 3.6-mg subcutaneous goserelin every 28 days. In all, 1,803 patients were enrolled between 1999 and 2006. As of May 18, 2010, 186 disease-free survival events and 73 deaths were recorded: 45 locoregional relapse events, 100 distant relapse events (including 53 bone metastasis events), and 14 contralateral breast cancer events. Adding zoledronic acid to endocrine therapy was associated with a continued reduction in recurrences inside and outside bone. [FDA: Bevacizumab Should No Longer Be Indicated for Breast Cancer] Adverse events associated with zoledronic acid treatment (arthralgia, bone pain, and pyrexia) were generally mild and consistent with the established safety profile. Zoledronic acid did not increase the occurrence of serious adverse events, compared with endocrine therapy alone. Importantly, there was no significant renal toxicity and no confirmed cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw. \"I find it quite intriguing and actually reassuring that with this therapeutic intervention that lasted 3 years - just an infusion every 6 months - you can change something in the long-term outcome of these patients,\" said Dr. Gnant. \"When we break it down according to additional preplanned subgroups, actually we see that ... adjuvant bisphosphonate treatment works in every subgroup, at least if you look at the tumor-derived parameters.\" The addition of adjuvant zoledronic acid may not make much difference in patients younger than 40 years, he suggested: \"It's exactly that group of patients where we cannot assume that the goserelin treatment will lead to full suppression of ovarian function and to very low estrogen levels,\" he said. Among patients aged 40 years or older in ABCSG-12, however, there was a roughly 40% difference in disease-free survival, which translated into a 40% reduction in the risk of dying from breast cancer, although this did not reach statistical significance. [Dual Anti-HER2 Blockade Called the Future of Breast Cancer Therapy] The AZURE researchers also did extensive planned subgroup analyses. \"One clearly stands out from all the others. That is the treatment effect on disease-free survival according to menopausal status,\" observed Dr. Coleman, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Sheffield (England). There was a clear overall survival benefit for women at least 5 years out from menopause on zoledronic acid. These women had a 29% reduction in the risk of death (P = .017). \"While obviously it's fair to say that the overall result of AZURE is a little bit disappointing, scientifically it makes perfect sense,\" said Dr. Gnant. \"Perfect suppression - or a natural lack of estrogen - in combination with adjuvant zoledronic acid leads to significant disease-free and overall survival benefit.\" To put the results in practical terms, Dr. Gnant noted that for the past 2 years, he would have put his 42-year-old wife on zoledronic acid if she developed ER-positive breast cancer, but not his 83-year-old mother. \"This has changed this afternoon. Now, my 83-year-old mother would also receive zoledronic acid,\" he said. The ABCSG-12 trial was sponsored by Austrian Breast & Colorectal Cancer Study Group, with support from AstraZenaca (which makes Arimedex) and Novartis Pharmaceutical (which makes Zometa). Dr. Gnant disclosed that he has significant financial relationships with several pharmaceutical companies, including Novartis.

Dr. Coleman disclosed that he receives grant support from Novartis and is a speaker for Novartis and Amgen.",

Don't forget to also check out the NCCN 2011 breast cancer treatment guidelines. Congrats on committing yourself to a healthy lifestyle and good luck with your treatment.  Thoughts and prayers to you.",
