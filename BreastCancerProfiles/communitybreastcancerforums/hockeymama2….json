      "Content": "hockeymama2 wrote: I am new to the site. Three weeks ago I found a lump in my left breast. I wentfor a mamo. The mamo was three hours which led to more pictures and a ultrasound from there I met with the radiologist and was told that the lump the I felt was indeed a cyst however they saw some tissue deep in left breast close to chest wall and recommend a steroestatic biopsy. Had biopsy this past Thursday. Took a lot of pictures after and then I met with the radiologist again. I was told that he was confident that he got enough tissue laterally however the area which is five to six centimeters is very close to the chest wall and he was notÂ able with the mamotomme needle to go as far back to the area. So we wait for the pathologist to read to determine if enough tissue was taken and if not then I will need to see a surgeon to have surgery to remove the abnormal tissue. I am scared. Wondering if any if you have had a similar experience and would be kind enough to share your experience with me. They told me that I had a 15-20% chance of this being cancer. Log in to post a reply",

The lump I felt was a cyst and they saw the abnormal tissue deep into the chest wall behind the cyst :-( trying to stay positive and praying it is benign.....just do not know what else it could be.......",
