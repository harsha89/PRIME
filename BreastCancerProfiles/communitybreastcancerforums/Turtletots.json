I had a large scar from my ovarian cancer surgery 13 years ago too--want to incorporate that as well. It would be a HUGE tattoo if that was the case, so we'll see. One word of caution though--I've heard many people, plastic surgeons and also tattoo artists alike, tell me that you really need to wait 3 to 5 years to do the tattoo--to really let the tissues and scar heal properly. So lots of time to plan and save for it!",

That and I've been so used to not having one. I also have an infected lymph node in my armpit, which is not comfortable at all. I hate to go against doctor's orders, but I am just starting to tear up thinking about putting this bra back on (it's been off for a half hour while I put a heating pad on the lymph node). Ugh.",

      "Content": "Turtletots wrote: I went to a specialty store today (had a choice between them and Nordstroms), and got fitted for bras and prosthetics. She told me the prices of the ones I picked, and how much I would have to pay over the benefit from my insurance. Well, it was about $50 for three bras and the prosthetics, so I didn't think it was that bad. Then I did a search online and saw how much cheaper they were, I decided to call Nordstroms to find out their prices. They were WAY cheaper than this place, and I would be able to get the same prosthetics for $0 out of pocket. Not sure how their bras compare though. I do know they will put pockets in any bra so the choices would be far more vast. So here's my thing--should I make an appointment and check what Nordstrom has and see if I can get similar product for nothing out of pocket, orÂ  just go with what I chose today? THe specialty store doesn't put in orders until Saturday, so I have some time. I was told by the durable medical folks that they would all be the same price no matter where I go. I guess that's not really true! What would you do? facingmastectomy.blogspot.com/ Log in to post a reply",

They spend a lot of time with you and are very good at making you happy about your purchase, but you get more for your money at Nordstrom's--IF you like Amoena, because that's all Nordy's has. Marzell's has a variety of brands, of both prosthetics and bras. They are fabulous at fitting you. I did go to Nordy's to buy a couple extra bras.",
