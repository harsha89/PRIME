My immediate response was no I want a BMX. My reason is that it is high grade and my breasts are dense so I would always worry that the mammogram might miss something! Also, after my sister was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer/BRCA 1# at the age of 27 and saw her go through her BMX,dose dense chemo,radiation,zoladex inj.,tamoxifen I wanted to try to avoid these things if I could.(it's 11 yrs now and she's doing great!) But everyone makes the decision that is best for them. Go with your gut feeling. Keep us posted on how you're doing! Hugs",

I had DCIS and opted for a BMX with immediate TE placement in January. Did your surgeon prescribe muscle relaxers? They helped me quite a bit and I'm not one to take medication but oh boy did I need it! Ask your husband to give you upper back/shoulder massages. Those helped me tremendously. What you are going through IS hard so be kind to yourself. I didn't need chemo or radiation either but I won't deny that what I went through was very hard and painful. Eat super clean and healthy to help in the healing process and take it easy. When you are ready, go out and do some walking to help with your fitness level. Your body needs it. I hiked quite a bit once I was cleared to do so and now I'm back to my trail running! You can do this.",
