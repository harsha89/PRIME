    "Content": "Jkono wrote: hi, I am 34. About six months ago I went to my GYN because I felt a lump and had breast pain. I had a diagnostic mammogram and US which were inconclusive. I then had an MRI done which stated, in short, there were fibroadenomas/cysts and to follow up in 6 months. Early this month I did follow up with another mammogram and US. Those tested basically stated similar findings. The radiologist recommended another follow up in another 6 months to confirm his findings. (He sent me a letter saying not to be worried, that he was being overly cautious). I continue to have breast pain and nipple sensitivity on the left side. I do have dense breast tissue. I am wondering if this is something I should be concerned with in fear that somehow something is still being missed. I am so scared. Log in to post a reply",
