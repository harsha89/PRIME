    "Content": "Ling wrote: Hi ladies, I have stage 4 breast cancer on my L breast (metastasis to the skin) and had mastectomy and axillary lymphnode dessection. The chemo was started at the beginning of January 2009. A mammo and a core biopsy before the chemo showed LCIS and ADH/borderline DCIS in my R breast. Most of the calcifications in it were removed by the stereotactic core biopsy. Back then, my onc and breast surgeon decided to treat the problem of my L breast first. Now, I have completed chemo and radiation (finished in July 2009). 2 weeks ago, I took another mammo. the report says that the breast is extremely dense and scattered calcifications within the R breast are stable. My breast surgeon plans to do a partial mastectomy to clean the margins of the LCIS+ADH/borderline DCIS . With the concerns of the history of BC on my L breast and the other scattered calcifications within my R breast, my question is that if total mastectomy is better in my case, or it's an over reaction? Thanks in advance for your help. Dx 8/29/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, 7/20 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
