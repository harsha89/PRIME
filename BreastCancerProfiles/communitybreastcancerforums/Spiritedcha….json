I've never had major surgery and never stayed in the hospital other than for the birth of my two kids and that was over 30 years ago! I had some minor out patient surgery over 20 years ago and at the time I wasn't able to take any pain medicine because it made me sick. I'm a little worried about that, but I'm even more worried about not being able to do things for myself after the surgery. I've always been so independent. It's hard to ask for help!",

I was not expecting it to be this painful and I think I tried to reduce the pain meds too soon. If I keep up with them, it's definitely more manageable. I'm down to 1 Percocet every 6 hours now (along with the muscle relaxers) and feeling much better. Surgery went well, no surgical bra for me (my surgeon actually wrote that on my chest). I stayed an extra night in the hospital because I wasn't ready to go. The bed was quite comfortable and the food was pretty good, so that made it harder to leave. By the second day I was ready to go home and I've spent the rest of the week on my recliner sofa sleeping a lot and enjoying the excellent care from my wonderful husband. I wish everyone had someone as nurturing and attentive as he is. It is making a world of difference. I'm surprised that my range of motion is much better than expected. I have to remind myself to keep my arms down because it's really not hard to raise them. I'm super impressed at how everything looks. So far I think I picked an excellent plastic surgeon because it looks like I will have minimal visible scarring. My drains have already slowed down significantly, so hopefully I will get them out sooner (I have 4). There are two tips that I am glad I learned from this site, @-BluGene. First, bring a LOOSE button up shirt to go home from the hospital. I can't believe that neither surgeon even mentioned that very important tip. Secondly, I have long hair and didn't consider what I was going to do with it until someone suggested a French braid. I had that done before the surgery so I didn't have to mess with it all week.",
