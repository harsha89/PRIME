I do have the \"caved in\" appearance because the area of my chest above the surgery has a normal layer of body fat and tissue. The area of the surgery has none of that and the skin is flat against my ribs without any \"cushioning.\" That causes the \"caved in\" look. It doesn't particularly bother me. If I wear loose shirts, they fall from the area with the body fat so that the caved in look isn't noticeable. There are photos on this website of others who have chosen not to have reconstruction. That should give you a better idea of what to expect. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/82/topic/610613",
