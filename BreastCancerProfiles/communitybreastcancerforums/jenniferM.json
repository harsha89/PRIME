I am a 34 year old single mom and nurse.  I was diagnosed in Ocotber with a 1.8 cm right breast invasive tumor-triple negative too.  Only one limph node, positive.  No metastisis anywhere else.  I just started the dose dense chemo. I am a stage 2 and grade three.  My surgeon says I am going to survive, my oncologist says that I have a 75% survival rate and the American cancer society says that I have a 92% survival rate. I pray every day.  Some days I feel like I am on top of the world and that I will beat this and other days I break down and cry like a baby. ",
