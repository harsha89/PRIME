Going onto taxotere its called here then herceptin for her2 pos. I also had hot flushed skin and all menopause symptoms.. horrid. I carry a wet washer..face cloth maybe you call it for wiping my skin. Hardest thing ive found is the fatigue fog that has turned into a complete sapping of my will to keep going. Ive been always a positive solution finding woman but this stuff is a killer. First two treatments not a problem but the effects are cumulative so it gets harder and harder. I'm a single mum, eight kids with six still at home so have always had high energy and been the one to keep on keeping on...these days its a major effort to stand up. Feel sometimes like its taking my sanity as well as my hair.. This site has been a life saver literally, as I join with the rest of you on this path. I had a double mastectomy in june and I reckon your sense of humour must be in your breasts cause Ive lost mine now.. Ill keep reading so thank you all so much for sharing so Im not so isolated xxxx",
