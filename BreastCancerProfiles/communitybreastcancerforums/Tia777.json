It was green and yellow so I pressed on my breast and it started flowing a thin blood tinged fluid.A lot came out.....gross!!!! I went to the er because it was Sunday fearing I have an infection they examined me and ran blood work. Everything is fine they say must have been a cyst drainage. Has anyone else had this happen?
