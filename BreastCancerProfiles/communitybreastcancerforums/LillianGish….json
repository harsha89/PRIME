My MO said he'd be keeping me on this drug through chemo. Stress, cortisol, anxiety can all contribute to waking up in the middle of the night..",

Blood vessels not invaded. Er positive (99%), PR positive (90%), HERS negative (FISH). No Ki67 scored. I met with the oncologist this week. He had ordered the Mammaprint test, but the results aren\u2019t here yet. He said he uses Mammaprint and not Oncotype DX because he doesn\u2019t like the intermediate scoring system. Anyway...he asked me to think about a question and I was hoping to get feedback from this group. What will I do if the Mammaprint score says chance of recurrence is low? Chemotherapy or no chemotherapy? He said clinically, it\u2019s a grade 3 tumor and over 2 cm, and that could be used to elect chemotherapy. The Mammaprint score might say high chance of recurrence and in which case it\u2019s crystal clear that chemo is called for. But the score might say low recurrence risk. Then what? I got a whole speech on everyone\u2019s preference is different, chemo is poison, etc. I am leaning towards the answer of chemo because I don\u2019t want a recurrence to realize, gee I should have had chemo. Throw everything at it to keep the cancer down. My mom and her mom died of cancer (different kind). But I also don\u2019t want to make decisions based in fear. I\u2019m not afraid of chemo at all...and I\u2019ve read about the short and long term potential side effects. I am afraid of recurrence though. Can I rely entirely on the Mammaprint score to tell me whether to have chemo or not? Could use some advice on what to do if the score comes in low.

So, I received the Mammaprint score today and it said there's a high risk of distant recurrence - 29% without chemo and hormonal therapy. Chemo was definitely the right choice and I had my first treatment today. With chemo and HT, 94.6% of the Mammaprint data base were distant metastasis free at 5 years. I know ER positive cancers have higher risk for spread after five years, but I think that's out of my hands now. I'm doing everything I can do without regret. Just wish I had this test earlier. It's clear from the report, they didn't get the request until 3 weeks after surgery, so no wonder I just got the results. Grrrrrr.",

Diveslikeagirl ~ most of the quote is from my own Mammaprint report. On page 1 of 3 at the bottom, there is a bar graph titled \"Predicted Benefit of Treatment at 5-Years.\" The bar graph says 94.6% (DMFI), meaning Distant Metastasis Free Interval. I think this is my particular score based on my genomics. I interpreted it to mean that only 5.4% of population data base that they compared me to, who also had my tumor's characteristics, had distant metastasis at the five year mark after chemo and hormone therapy. Mammaprint studied a group of women and their experience, and that is the database that Mammaprint compares you to when they give you the score. On the second part of my quote, that is from a few different readings where I read that estrogen positive breast cancer has a higher recurrence rate after five years, compared to some other types. I found this particular article informative, in case it's helpful. This article is from 2014 so it's a bit old, but when I read it it helps me think. To be clear though, I'm so new at this, please don't let anything I say be hard evidence. I totally admit I'm not an expert. https://www.ajmc.com/journals/evidence-based-oncology/2014/september-2014/recurrence-of-breast-cancer-years-after-the-initial-tumor?p=2",

I'm resting up for radiation and starting to get outside more and more to shake off the chemo cobwebs. So glad it's behind me....and I wish the same feeling for your wife. My MO substituted Taxotere for Taxol this last round. I found it more tolerable, but fatigue this past week was INTENSE! My worrisome side effect is some tingling in my feet, which will hopefully go away in the near future.

A total stranger came up to me to say that as she was following me up the hill, she had this really strong feeling I was going to be ok. She said a few words about how it may seem that I was weak now, but in the days ahead, I would be strong. And she said the feeling was so strong, she felt like someone was in her ear and wanted her to tell me that. Seemed like a nice, normal person without an agenda. My sister expressed almost the same words...that when she thought of me, she just got this sense I was going to be ok. Not even worried.

I'll be thinking of you tomorrow and sending support cybernetically (I don't know if that's a word, but I'm using it anyway)! The treatment seemed easy to me on the day of the infusion. And yeah, isn't that Decadron something else? I think I took an Ativan and fell asleep around 11:30 that night. I took some more Decadron today too and feel a little buzzed. Skipped a nap today so I'll sleep tonight. They put a Nuelasta box on my stomach the day of treatment. It didn't hurt. The little box dripped some white cell boost in me 27 hours later. That didn't hurt either as it quietly drips in after giving you a five minute warning. Thought I'd give you that tip in case they do the same for you. I'm at the end of the second day, and feel a little light headed, but otherwise just fine. I've been careful to follow all the prescription medication instructions - like taking Advil and Claritan two hours before the Neulasta drip this afternoon. My treatment may differ from you ladies, but I'm trying hard to stay ahead of side effects. In my head, I'm not expecting a side effect...I'm expecting to be fine until something comes up. Got out and walked today and it felt really good to get some fresh air. As someone told me recently, you are stronger than you think. And now we are going to prove it.

Hair started falling out day 12 and it takes a couple days. Welcome Beznaranca too! Don't know how many mg's, but I was in the chair 3.5 hours. Hi Cheryl, I also hope you're feeling better now! I also had a follow up visit with MO a week after treatment. Seemed like mostly just a blood check to make sure white cell counts were high enough. Thank you OCPeregrina, Nanette, Christine ~ I really appreciated the cyberhugs. I'm ok now. No matter how much I expected the hair loss, it was still a shocker. So, now I'm owning it. Hubby helped me shave it all off. I have some hats, and I am watching You Tube's on tying scarves over my head. I have three holiday parties to attend this week, and I'll be gosh darned if cancer is going to keep me isolated. So.....A little bit of make up, some pretty earrings....we got this girls!",

Nanette ~ thank you for mentioning bone and joint pain, but I am sorry you're experiencing that. It's good you shared all your feelings with the nurse. For the past three months, my lower back has felt kind of weird. MO tells me to relax, it's nothing. He is very certain about that, without running a single test. Now starting last week, I've now moved into soreness in my lower back when I sit down. Of course, I think the worst (and still do). But I'm making a list of all the OTHER reasons my back could be sore, and even though I'm not on Taxol but instead Taxotere, perhaps the chemo is making my pelvic bone sore. I'll put that on the list. I am asking my MO about this on Monday when I get my next treatment. Having a bone scan on Jan 2 that my radiologist ordered even though she also wasn't worried, and I admit I am trying hard not to be scared about seeing the results. JoyontheJourney ~ Welcome! For your questions about mouth care, I found BeckyJL's post very informative. Scroll up on this thread to 12/19. It seems we all kind of scramble in some way through our first treatment. Hope you're doing ok. Questions are important and keep asking (that's at least my motto). Flower ~ I live in San Diego, so cold doesn't have the same meaning here as the East Coast, but I'm headed to Barefoot Dreams website anyway. It was 52 degrees here last night and my head was freezing! Thank you for the recommendation. MarneyMay ~ I'm getting rides to treatment too. This is mostly because everyone asks how can they help me and I just don't need much. The doctor did tell me not to drive to the first couple treatments until I was sure I could do so....but this is a way my family can stay connected. Totally get the feeling of wanting peace and quiet. AngieinAmsterdam ~ Welcome to you too! I am having my next treatment on Christmas Eve as well. And Mammaprint confirmed chemo was necessary. Not the best news I've ever had! I'm glad you're with us and I think all of us can completely understand how hard the first treatment is emotionally. I'm sure you'll do great, but let us know. BeckyJL ~ I confess I giggled about the Velcro effect. I know EXACTLY what you're saying. There's still a place on my head that feels like Velcro. I was going to take your advice with the Nair, but forgot to get some at the drug store today. I have just a couple more spots to finish. The hair on my arms is now gone. I was told the hair loss starts at the top and works it's way down the body and when it grows back, it starts at the bottom. That doesn't make sense to me logically though, so perhaps that's urban legend. Today's hat is a soft beanie that is a camouflage pattern. I'm hiding from breast cancer today. :) I picture it looking for me, going \"hey, where'd she go?\" and then the chemo flanking and gunning them all down. Ha! Tomorrow....Decadron steroids and Monday I do this whole thing again. Ugh. \"Thank you sir may I have another!\" Just had an Animal House vision. We can do this!",

Plus...yesterday I made the mistake of telling the nurse practitioner about my back pain, and she strongly inferred it was bone metastasis without any tests! I told her I was getting a bone scan soon and she said good because it \u201csure seems like something is up and progressing.\u201d On Christmas Eve, 2 weeks before I can have the test. Sleep well Lillian! This back pain started just a couple weeks ago, and could be a lot if things. I\u2019m kind of mad at her for doing that to me",

Did your doctor give you any pills for nausea, like maybe Zofran or Reglan? That's what they gave me to take in case I had nausea. If they didn't, be sure and call your doctor and ask for help with nausea. It's easier if you stay ahead of it. Have any ginger ale handy? Crackers, applesauce...stick to bland. Don't eat your favorite foods when you have nausea...they'll no longer be your favorite after this is over. If you can get out and walk for even a few minutes...fresh air helps too. And sleep. And yes, lots and lot of water. Hang tough, but ask for help from your doc if you need it ~ you can do this! Couple more days you'll start to feel better I hope.",

I feel funny calling after hours/weekend too. We shouldn't, but I understand. I suspect by the end of this Mr. Toads Wild Cancer Ride, calling will get easier. Had my bone scan today (because of my back ache). Before going, I studied up on bone scans...how they're done, what they diagnose, what to look for, what a normal scan looks like and what a cancerous one looks like. I did this just in case I got a peek. And I did get a 30 second peek from across the room. What I saw looked normal - lots of white bones. Total amateur opinion of course. Then I asked the guy who I know can't say too much, \"so....are those my bones?\" He said yes, and I said, \"well they look like pretty good bones if I say so myself.\" He then said, \"this must just be a baseline bone scan for you. This is your first one, right? Yes, they use baselines to compare to later scans.\" To my hopeful, grasping at straws mind, that said the scan looked normal to him. All that information will keep me sane until Tuesday when the doctor gives me the results. We are Warriors, not Worriers. Keep fighting!!",

I don't know if this resonates with you, but what makes me feel really bad besides the infection, is that my MO's office didn't really take my infection seriously. At all. My team took 5 hours to call me back about my infection and then said, \"well, keep taking the antibiotic\" with very few questions leading up to that \"diagnosis.\" I'm was here at home on my own all week really sick without medical input. So, my plan at Monday's follow-up is to be a strong advocate for myself and really push them HARD on making sure it doesn't happen again in my last round. Infection is scary and that's important! I just want to say you are important too. What you're doing is very hard, and the fact you are doing it is amazing. You don't have to be positive about it - no one asks a guy to be positive and smile when he's fighting someone. That's true for ALL of us! Your MO should have been more helpful to you in answering your questions about your heart. This disease is awful, and one of the worst parts is what it does to people's sense of emotional well being. I'm sorry you feel down. It will get better, but I understand how hard it is to see it when you're sick. Boy do I! Cheryl, you've had a rough ride too! I would crumble. Glad it's getting better and I do hope that trend continues. Sunny hugs to you too!",

Hair: we used an electric shaver and just shaved most of it off when I noticed too many bald patches on my head. Then, in the shower, with lots of soap, I used a razor get a closer shave. One more time tomorrow should finish the job. I just need to this to be over with and done so I can move on. Like Becky said, I didn't want to be mangy and clumpy. My scalp felt a little funny the first night, but now, it's just dry. Putting lots of lotion on it. And my scarves are making me feel like \"Rhoda\" - Mary Tyler Moore's best friend in that 70's show. I almost wore boots today, but decided that wouldn't be good for keeping my feet safe from neuropathy. Rhoda would have worn boots. Anyhoo....I've slept in a night cap a few nights but last night my head was hot after wearing the Rhoda scarf all night at the holiday party...so I slept without anything on my head. So, I guess last night I was Bruce Willis. :) My 17 and 20 year old daughters are doing fine with the hair loss. I know if I freak out, they will too, so for them....my motto is this is no big deal. It's just hair and it will grow back. Good luck to those getting started - you'll do great I'm sure!",

My choice was to just get it all off quickly and early. Now though, some hair is trying to grow back a little bit right above my forehead. Unfortunately, I'm starting to look like:  This situation needs immediate attention. End of day 9 here on my second round. Kind of a rough week with the infection, lower back pain, thrush in my mouth, digestive issues I don't want to get into AND a lot of fatigue. Blood work does show the rebound is slower on the second treatment. I also heard the third round is the hardest, but I'm not giving that any emotional energy right now. It will need to get in line.

Seemed to be either an infection again like the 2nd round or an allergic reaction. I'm better today, but yesterday was pretty bad. Shaking, chills, heavy breathing, kind of out of it...slept 16 hours straight. When I called the triage nurse line, it took a while to get a call back, but they told me it was likely a reaction to the chemo and take the antibiotic for three days. I do feel better today. I will talk to them on my appointment on Monday about this, because it seems like a stronger infection than the last round...and I'm worried about the last round in three weeks. Almost went to ER yesterday. I don't think the second day should make me so sick. Perhaps I'm having an allergic reaction to the Taxotere like Flower. I will ask about that too so thank you for mentioning that Flower. Well, perhaps the coming days will be easier now that I'm through 2nd day reaction. My eyelashes are thinning. Odds are very strong they will come back sometime when chemo is over.",

It isn't depression, it's chemo. I'm certain about that. And when chemo stops, energy will increase. Monday is my last chemo treatment. That sounds great, but I worry whether four cycles is enough, because many of you are doing the AC + 12 weeks of Taxol, or otherwise longer treatment. I was told I only needed four rounds because I was node negative....but that rule doesn't seem like it applies to everyone. I wish my oncologist was more communicative. I think he is knowledgeable, but I haven't even seen him for two months. It's nice your medical team cares about you Angie. Cancer can be very depressing to people. I do find myself telling people \"I'm fine\" when they ask, but really, am I fine? No, I don't think I am. Trying to reassure my kids, husband and family so they don't worry....but really I just went through a very difficult fearful experience with diagnosis/surgery, I'm sick with chemo and I'm adjusting to a life that will always be wondering when cancer may come back to me (I had a high recurrence score). Not fine. But not a hot mess falling apart either. I'm looking for a therapist myself. Someone I can talk to about not being fine, without worrying my family. Hang in there, it gets better. Lillian",

Chemo is hard on veins. MCBaker, sounds like you are almost done! Support to you! Anxiouslady, hang in there. I know you can do it, and when you've done the six rounds, you can feel like you did everything you could to kick butt. I had my first radiation mapping meeting. It was pretty easy, even the tattoos. But at the end, the RO came out and told me she sees a fluid sac underneath my arm and we should ultrasound it. And maybe biopsy it because it feels like a swollen lymph node.  First I was going to have to wait a couple weeks to have the ultrasound, but luckily RO was able to get me in yesterday. Turned out to be a seroma pushing up on a very clear and just fine lymph node making it seem swollen, but wasn't. Not going to lie, these past couple of days were scary. Worried the cancer had come back only four months after surgery and in my lymph nodes. Whew! I hope this terror gets easier to handle as time progresses. Thinking of everyone in their treatments ~ peace to you.",

Yesterday, I took my decadron and didn't feel anything but a lot of energy to decorate the house for Christmas. On Saturday, I went to CVS and bought every remedy know to mankind...just to be sure. It felt good to be prepared. Today I found out I needed Claritan because of the Nuelesta shot that was put on my stomach today....that will inject 27 hours later. The chemo treatment was no big deal. Calm and no pain. I had T & C, and it took about 3 hours. I'm home tonight and feel just fine. I hear the next couple days may change that rosy outlook, but until I feel it, it won't happen!

Flower ~ Sorry about the disappointment with that ACS program. :( Sweetolyve ~ My colleagues at work just gave me an essential oil diffuser for Christmas, and you just inspired me to hook it up. I bet it will be a nice addition to my bedtime routine. Glad you're nausea us better. I will also get that book! Christine ~ I am in awe of anyone working while going through chemo. You are very strong to do so! And yeah, I got the whole hair thing over quickly. Shaved it as soon as I could. Now that it's gone, I'm doing ok with it. It's my new reality. Becky ~ it's ok to be upset about losing hair! Anxiouslady, same! We've never had to do this, and if I have shed a few tears in the process.....so be it! I'm no monument to bravery! But we're doing it. It's about survival! And yes, I've gotten lots of makeup and hats, which I've appreciated....but I bet men going through chemo don't get these kinds of things to look better. Still, I choose optimism. I will always try to do so...warning to everyone here. The glass is usually half-full for me. :) In fact, it's usually all full.....half liquid and half air. My hair is gone and so I went to my company Christmas party rocking a beautiful headscarf and earrings. My friend did my make up. I wanted to show everyone I was ok and that I wasn't dying. I can't tell you what a great day it was. So many people were so glad to see me ok and told me they were rooting for me. And maybe they were just being nice, but several people said I looked beautiful. You don't need hair to be beautiful.",

Kind of still tired from round 2 though and all that stupid nurse drama of wondering if I was stage IV for a few weeks. It is supposed to rain all week here in San Diego. So....I'll be talking to no one but my brother tomorrow during treatment and maybe I'll let chemo run it's course this week while I sleep and listen to it rain. Sleep, hydrate, eat light, walk each day for 30 min...repeat as needed. I'm picturing a bear headed into her cave to Netflix and Chill for winter. :) BTW, question for the group. The NP and infusion nurse is with me on each chemo treatment day. And then I see the NP a week after that to monitor blood and follow up. My MO has exited I guess until after chemo.

My two guesses are - slippers are better protection against neuropathy and accidental cuts to your feet which could cause infection. I read somewhere to always wear my slippers while on chemo, especially if you have hardwood floors. Hard floors can be hard on feet, and lead to neuropathy. And when I was reading about avoiding infections, the American Cancer Society said to take good care of your feet because cuts and germs can lead to infections. Just guesses on my part. And I realize not all slippers equal - my daughter gave me some from Old Navy that are cute, but have like 0 foot support and 0 tread on the bottom. My Ugg slippers though....heaven! Day 10 of third round and I'm finally feeling fairly normal again. Spoke at length to NP about what happened on day 2 and that we need to do something different because I was really really sick with infection or whatever. She was starting to think it was an allergic reaction, but was going to consult with the team and they'd be ready for my final round on Feb 4th. Maybe add Benadryl and/or additional steroids. I did learn that unlike the rule where you must start chemo by a certain date after surgery, there is no exact date to start radiation. So, after my last round and I'm feeling better, I'm going to take a break and plan something fun too.",
