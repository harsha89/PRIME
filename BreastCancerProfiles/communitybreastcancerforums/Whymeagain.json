    "Content": "Whymeagain wrote: Hi, I was diagnosed in 2013 With breast cancer and pronounced clear in 2014. In Feb. Of 2016 I went to E.R. for what I thought was a serious flu episode and was told by the E.R. Dr. that I had masses in my liver and lungs. Now I may be the most naive person on the planet, for I honestly did not know I was to go in to my oncologist for monthly blood work, so I didn't. This is a long complicated story and I am trying to keep it short. Right now I have stage 4 metastasized breast cancer and am terrified. I started chemo again in March of 2016 and so many things are happening. I've never been in a support group due to having no vehicle and have done all this alone since 2013. I have looked for people to connect with and I pray I can do so here. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
