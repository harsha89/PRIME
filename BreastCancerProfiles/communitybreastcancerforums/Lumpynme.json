BIL in wisconsin has been dx with Stage IV pancreatic cancer -his liver is involved -and his non aggressive chemo was trying to kill him so they have discontinued..i think well go visit over labor day while he is healthy enough to sit with his brother (my ex/live in). RED FACE: i had that for the few days i was on decadron with my A/C. it would go away after.... good to catch up with all of you!so jealous of the canton gals for your coffee date! wish there was someone out near me! well- enjoy the sunday and the end of summer stuff as fall is quickly approaching!",
