My breast tissue is dense. Bi-rads 4 Heterogenously dense. Last year I was complaining about my breast pain. I did my yearly mammogram and they did Ultrasound. They found nothing my doctor said everything looks normal. But i had some pain on and off back then. This year I had a new PCM and she refer me to breast care center. Coz I have this pain that it wont go away it started last June of this year. I noticed my bra had stained. So i checked all my bras (different colors) they have stained on it. ( i just noticed it coz I always wearing black bras) The pain won't go away until now. So I did my mammo and ultrasound last July. The radiologist found a tumor on my right breast. I was completely went blank. Why? Again? The whole week I can't sleep. So I had my core biopsy needle last August. and I got the results the next day. It was benign Thank God!!! I have fibrocystic tissue. And i just found out i have a cyst on my left breast. my doctor didn't mention to me about the cyst from last year. I had my test done for breast MRI last August to check why I have a discharged. The doctor called me she said everything is normal I don't have cancer. From June to this day I still have breast pain that it won't go away (both breast). My doctor said probably I'm carrying heavy stuff, or doing workouts. or if I'm taking hormones therapy thing? I don't take meds or rx hormones. She said breast pain causes by your cycle. Probably I'm going to menopausal...? Or there's something going on my chestwall cavity??? Oh man! My pain is like everyday, every seconds. Persistent pain that won't go away. The stings, burning sensation, pain near my armpits. It happen dozen times a day. The assitant nurse told me to take some Tylenol for pain. I want to get a test for PET scan. But they won't let me since my breast biopsy, breast MRI came out normal. I have an appt this September for my pulmonologist. 2006 they found a lung nodule. But thankfully the nodule it's not growing. I don't know my cyst are going haywire. Sucks ",
