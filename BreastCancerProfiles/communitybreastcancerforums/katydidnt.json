My question to readers is, is there anyone out there who has tried alternative solutions to this problem, i.e. accupuncture with success, or surgery.  I'm told that surgery will only make the nerve endings grow back bigger and angrier.  I'm seeing a neurologist next month out of desperation. Any thoughts or suggestions are greatly appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
