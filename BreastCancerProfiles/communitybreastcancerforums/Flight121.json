It's dry and a little cracked, it used to be sort of a brownish colour but I've noticed that it's been getting more and more red and a little bigger over the past few days. It's been there for several weeks and I thought that it was probably just an ingrown hair so I haven't done anything about it. As far as I know there are no unusual bumps in my breast itself.  My question is, has anybody had an ingrown hair in this area that looked like what I've described? I just don't want to go to the doctor and have them think i'm over reacting if it's something easily recognizable. It's not altogether very sore so I'm just not sure.  Probably unrelated too, I have a lump under the armpit on the same breast side as that bump but the lump has been there for years and swells and then goes down along with my period so I'm assuming that is just hormonal.  So yes, any advice or suggestions you could give, would really be appreciated!  Thank you so much.
