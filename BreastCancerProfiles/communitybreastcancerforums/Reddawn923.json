Do you get this after surgery?  I was diagnosed with 4.3 cm lump on the top of my right breast and it's spread to my lymph nodes.  I feel so dumb in comparison to all of you who know exactly what your condition is and know what you're talking about.  I'm scheduled for a radical mastectomy of my right breast and lymph node removal on May 9th.  Any info as to how I can learn all the terminology? Thanks ladies!",

Does it mean how many times a week? 12 weeks x 4 cycles...does that mean 4 times a week for 12 weeks? I was told AC 12 weeks x 4 cycles and T weekly for 12 weeks. I will then have radiation 5 days a week for 5 weeks.  I don't know if I'm mentally ready for all of this.  Thanks for your help. I hope I'm",

I guess in time I'll learn all the terminology, all about the meds and about procedures. I actually do have a copy of my biopsy report. I'll try to read it and figure it out.  I'm so confused and nervous.  I guess it's the fear of the unknown. Hope you're doing well and I appreciate the welcome to BCO. ~Red",
