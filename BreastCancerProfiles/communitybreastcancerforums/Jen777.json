I have tissue expander's and I will have reconstruction surgery 5 to 9 months after radiation. My radiation oncologist reassures me there is a very low risk for a poor outcome to reconstructive surgery or any negative effects to the size, shape or look of my left breast. I'm thankful my tissue expander's look as well as they do . I'm worried radiation will change that or I will have a poor outcome when I have implant surgery. Is anyone happy with their breast after radiation and implant surgery Log in to post a reply",
