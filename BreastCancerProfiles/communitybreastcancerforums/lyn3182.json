    "Content": "Oct 1, 2015 07:04PM - edited Oct 1, 2015 07:05PM by lyn3182 I was diagnosed and treated for Hodgkin's IIIB in 1991 at the age of 19 and had MOPP, ABVD and a month of mantle radiation. I'm lucky enough to live in a city with a late effects clinic. A couple weeks ago, I got sent for an MRI, and at around the same time ( actually about a week before) I started having pain in one, then both breasts. No really painful pain, just more than an ache, and in very specific spots. Not period related as I've not had one of those for a long time. I received the news that the MRI showed a lump, pretty much where the pain is, and the Dr. could feel it on exam. It's tender when pressed, about 1 cm., but not painful. Now I am waiting for a call from the surgeons office for a biopsy, and am left wondering. I hate waiting. I realise this is a dumb question for a breast cancer forum, but has any post-radiation patient had a lump and a bad MRI that turned out to be non-cancerous? My Dr gave me a very waffley answer when asked. Am I silly to hope, given my history, that this could be a big fat nothing? Thanks.",
