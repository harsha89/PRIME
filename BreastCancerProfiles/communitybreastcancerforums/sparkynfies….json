My appointment yesterday went well I think.  The doctor was very informative and patient.  She answered all of our questions and explained everything in detail.  We were in with her for well over an hour discussing options.  They were considering trying to biopsy the other end to see if it was atypical as well, if not maybe we didn't have to remove so much.  I told them it didn't matter, either way I want it out.  I need to know that the entire mass has been removed and analyzed.  That's the only 100% way to make sure all the ADH is out and there is nothing more sinister hiding.  I'm now waiting for them to set me up with the plastic surgeon to discuss my options.  The BS is not positive if there will be enough tissue left to rebuild from or if I'm going to need some type of more invasive reconstruction.  I already feel such a huge sense of relief that the decision is made and I have a plan of attack.  If it comes back with cancer in there then I'll tackle it, if it comes back that there was only a tiny bit of ADH and the rest was just fibrosystic well then I'll be estatic and know that I did the best I could to protect my health.  I will say that I'm kind of saddened to be losing my breast or, at least my natural breast.  They played a big part in my role as a mom for so many years nurturing and feeding my babies.  I guess it did it's job and it's ready to retire now.

I'd love to chime in with more, especially on the topic of \"well why are you so worried if it's not cancer\" but to be honest I'm too exhausted to type out a well written response.  People who haven't been there just don't seem to understand but all of us here.. we know.  Hugs going out to everyone tonight for a good nights sleep with less stress and worry!!  ",

I've decided to schedule an appointment with a different BS at a woman's hospital for a second opinion.  I just need to have more info and more understanding I think.  I'm also not too comfortable with the PS that is local to me, this isn't his specialty at all.  Like I told my mom if it were one of my kids I'd take them to Children's Hospital, this is something serious and I want to know I've done the best I could for me.  This whole process feels like a nightmare rollercoaster that I just want off of.",
