I got a call from the GYN's RN saying it was a fibroadenoma and that it was benign but I needed a second opinion from a breast surgeon as a matter of precaution.  The next day I got a letter from the radiologist saying that I needed follow-up care right away and that there was an abnormality on my biopsy.  I called the GYN and the nurse had somehow missed the line that said probable fibroadenoma with increased stromal cellularity- recommend EXCISION.  I was very upset that I had gone from floating on air to despai very quickly. I had my excisional biopsy surgery on Friday.  My husband has been away with military duty, but was luckily able to be with me until tomorrow.  My results should be ready on Wednesday.  I am so afraid of getting that phone call.  My surgeon feels that there is a good chance it is benign based on what he said at my pre-surgery appointment. I have a history of anxiety relating to health issues and I have been holding it together, but now it is at the point that I feel very doom and gloom.  i am trying very hard to be positive.
