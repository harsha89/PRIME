I actually like the mastectomy bras I have, they're not overly stylish, but not too plain either, it has some lace and flowery pattern on part of it, not matronly.  They cover up the scars pretty well, but not completely as my scars are a little higher on my chest, due to wear the tumor was.  The problem that I have with it, should I ever be walking around in front of anyone (I haven't, but I'm just saying this would be a problem if you took this design and turned into a bathing suit) is that from the side you can see a little bit of the prosthesis.  So there needs to be more material around the outside to cover up where the pocket for the prosthesis is.  Hope this helps, good luck with your project!",
