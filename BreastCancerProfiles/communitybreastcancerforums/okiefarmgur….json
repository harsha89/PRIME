I am close to Stillwater...Steroids are a very important part of treatment or so I was told by my oncologist...they give you energy, boost your appetite, not sure if they really have any affect on nausea. The steroids are started the day prior to chemo, 2 in the a.m. and 2 in the p.m. and the same the day of and the day after chemo.   What nausea meds are you taking? I have Emend and Zofran and that has controlled the nausea very well for the most part...the last two treatments (of 6) I had more nausea problems it seems.  The Emend is a miracle drug...it is taken the day of chemo and the next two days. The Zofran is for back up and does a great job.  I have had my 6 chemo treatments, started March 2. Will find out this week if I am going to have to have more or if I will start radiation in one month.",

I would like to join the June group if you would allow.  I actually was scheduled to FINISH my chemo this month, on June 15.  I would be happy to share any knowledge or experiences I have gained through my time in chemo treatment, as well as offer any other support or tricks I learned. I do need to add that on Sunday June 13, I found a new lump just above my collar bone; I have seen both the surgeon and oncologist and have a PET scan on Tuesday hopefully to get the results on Wed.  I realize that may change whether you would want me to be part of your group and understand should you decide it is best that I don't.  I wouldnt want to freak anyone out and make them unsure of their treatment, etc. I can find another group that is experiencing that type of problem.",
