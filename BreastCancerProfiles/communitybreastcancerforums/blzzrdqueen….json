Jen Edited to note that I called my primary and she is no longer taking my insurance!!!  So now I have to find a new primary doctor, but for this I am going to see my ob/gyn.  I wanted to go to someone I know and trust instead of my initial visit being with a complete stranger...

Thanks for asking!!",
