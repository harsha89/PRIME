I was totally stunned. The radiologist said that because of my anatomy, there is no safe way to treat me with radiation. According to her, this could decrease my survival rate 3-4%. It sure seems like it would be a higher number. I'm a bit nervous, of course, but am also relieved that I don't have to have the treatment. This happen to anyone else?",
