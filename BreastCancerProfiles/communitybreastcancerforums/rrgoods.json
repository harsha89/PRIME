The techs were having a hard time finding my tatoos and got out the famous black sharpie. Both the Techs and the RO said the blotches are normal and will disappear in time. Just finished today with my last booster and am pumped! Will be expecting more blotchiness, redness and itchiness from the boosters but thanks to the Aloe Vera plant I bought and the Mepilex I do not expect too much discomfort. Hang in there! The end is in sight!",

My appt is everyday at 11am. My work hours are 8-5 everyday (no weekends). Do you think it may benefit that I try to change my treatment time to later in the day? Starting to get a littled pooped around 2:30 pm. Not bad, but I know it will get worse.",

Just a few rashes - they don't bother me. The one thing though is the breast they are treating is hot to the touch. I'm on fire! Hear the boosters can be rough. Hope that does not happen.",

Without hesitiation the Oncologist recommended Chemo - the usual cocktail - 4 treatments. Chemo only give me a 3% better chance of recurrence. I pointed out to the Onco \"Why would I put poison in my body for only 3% gain?\" Her response is she recommends Chemo for any patient who Oncotype score is 12 and above. Could not get out of there fast enough. Getting a second opinion.",
