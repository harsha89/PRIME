I have my Biopsy today.... I have had a history of Cysts , but this is never easy. I have a question- My original Caretaker is a Nurse practitioner, so will she be the one to recommend a new doctor for me when  my Pathology report comes back. I am in Houston, Tx- and would like to have my treatments at M.D. Anderson Cancer Institute. All the best to everyone!! ",

I have to go in for a Diagnostic Ultrasound in a couple of weeks- so I have been really educating myself as much as possible on this breast issue that we are all somehow facing, just know that this forum will be there for you, so please keep in touch.

I have been at work and just went down to the ladies restroom where it is quiet and had a hell of cry- It's ok- you need to be able to get some time to yourself where you can get in touch with your emotions and just let it all hang out. I will have a guided biopsy on Wednesday- and I have already been told by the Ultrasound tech and doctor  that was on staff that day- that it may be cancer- stage 2 - so I have did my research and Have true dimpling and pain. So, just go and take care of yourself - because everyone means well, but they do not know what we are facing but us....",

The Doctor that was interpreting my Ultrasound results says that the Tumor below my nipple- about 2.4cm - will have to come out- so she says right now I am classified as stage 2. I am with Herman -Cypress right now- but I am thinking about M.D. Anderson as well. I have lots of pain  & indentation concerning my breast, and right now I am having back pain- do not know if its the possible cancer or because I have a tipped uterus- everything seems to hurt since I have the Diagnostic Mammogram with Ultrasound on yesterday....",
