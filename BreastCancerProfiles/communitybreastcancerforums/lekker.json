As others have mentioned, there are several other known genetic mutations with links to breast cancer.  I've been tested for almost all of them and not because of a strong family history of breast cancer, rather because of a personal history of multiple cancers that both presented at a young age (two indicators of a possible genetic basis for the cancers). When I went through the testing process, my genetic counselor first ordered BRCA testing but only for the three founder mutations most commonly found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (my dad's side). When those results came in, my GC said \"congratulations - you're negative\". I insisted on the full BRCA sequencing plus BART and she approved.  When that came back negative, I met with a geneticist (MD) who examined me for external signs of other genetic syndromes (several have things like large skulls, freckles on the lips and gums, and other unusual traits).  She didn't find anything.  I asked for the Broca panel from the University of Washington (developed by Mary Claire King) and it was approved.  It also came back negative - I didn't have a single mutation in any of the 40 genes.  So I am another uninformed negative.  I feel like I either have an as-yet undiscovered mutation, or I was exposed to some environmental toxin that didn't hurt my brother or my parents, or I just have terrible luck.  I already did the most aggressive surgeries (BMX and hyst/ooph).  I go for annual skin checks and have frequent colonoscopies so I am being proactive where I can.  Some people might wonder if it really matters if there's a genetic basis since I've already done all I can do.  When people ask me that, I show them pictures of my little girls.  My greatest hope is that I eventually find a mutation that caused this for me - then my daughters can choose to test for it and we can all celebrate when they get a true negative.  Because if that doesn't happen, they will have to start colonoscopies at 20 and breast screening in their early thirties, and I'd like to spare them that. ",

As Melissa has said, there are times when syndromes other than BRCA should be tested first. Melissa - were you tested for the mutations that cause Lynch Syndrome? The classic Lynch cancers are colon and uterine, but there are several others. My GC had the lab pull my old colon polyp and run an IHC test as a first step in my process as Lynch was her first suspicion. That particular test isn't 100% especially with an in situ cancer like mine but Lynch was definitively ruled out thanks to the Broca panel. This is all in its infancy and many doctors have no training or education that qualifies them to request or refuse tests. My GC had me examined by a geneticist to look for signs of any of the other known syndromes before they authorized the Broca. Stick with a GC to start the process.",

No one with a tumor that overexpresses HER2 would ever have the oncotype done so please take that out of this thread. AA - it is possible that a similar test could eventually be developed to help drive treatment decisions for HER2 patients, but it is not relevant to this particular discussion.   Nancy - you asked about calculating risk using the oncotype, but forgoing endocrine therapy.  Oncotype is calculated by looking at the expression of 16 genes (and 5 reference genes) - I posted the details in a thread about progesterone blocking drugs (don't have link right now but I will post it later as I think it's relevant here).  If your score is high because your ER group gene expression is low (basically you are \"barely\" ER/PR positive or even negative by their measure), you might not get as much benefit from endocrine therapy.  Genomic Health doesn't tell us the 16 individual calculations that make up our Recurrence Risk Score, but they do tell us their ER, PR and HER2 scores (because those are currently the only \"actionable\" measures on their own).  The lower the ER (and possibly PR, but that's a discussion for another thread), the lower your benefit from endocrine therapy.  You can have a high oncotype even with high ER/PR expression because of the other genes (proliferation and invasion) and in that case I would think endocrine therapy would be extremely important.  You can look at your report to see your individual ER and PR scores - if they are really high, maybe you could discuss with your doctor what your options are (clinical trial for a new endocrine therapy, or off label use of other approved drugs, etc). MameMe - I'm very sorry to hear of your progression.  From reading your story, I feel like you blame yourself for not continuing with endocrine therapy when you were diagnosed the first two times.  I don't mean to overstep, but please be gentle with yourself.  One thing oncotype shows is how many women progress even with tamoxifen (and chemo). I had a low score of 13 which means that 9 out of every 100 women with my similar tumor profile were stage IV within 10 years even with tamoxifen.  I hope you have a long run with taxol and better experience with tamoxifen/AIs this time if you try them again.",

Cancer is a heterogenous disease - it's not impossible to have very different results within the same tumor.  Back to the old but original reason for this thread, the OP was concerned because her pathology didn't mention Ki-67 and that made her feel that she wasn't given all of the information she needed to make the chemo/no chemo decision.  I too felt shorted because my pathology didn't mention Ki-67 but eventually realized that the oncotype test did measure it - as well as 4 other proliferation genes.  Like the OP, I had to be convinced not to do chemo because I wanted to do everything possible to avoid a recurrence. Once I understood that chemo doesn't guarantee a cure and it has its own risks to consider, I agreed that the right plan for me was to forego it.   Here's my post... the PR score is just one of the factors that goes into calculating the oncotype score. They break down the different genes into groups and multiply each group by a factor they somehow came up with to get the final score. PR is in the \"ER related genes\" group which is the only group to have a negative multiplier - the higher that group's score, the more it lowers the final result. So if you have low or absent PR expression, it will raise that part of the score. If the scores from the other groups are low, you can still end up with a low score of course - PR is just one piece of the puzzle.  The test was then validated using 675 node negative ER positive tamoxifen treated cases from NSABP B-14. In this analysis given classes of genes were given previously determined weighting factors and prognostic scores were calculated. The weightings would seem to make sense with proliferation, Her2 related, and invasion group genes increasing the score and ER related genes decreasing the score. The score was a continuous variable, but for the convenience of the presentation the patients were divided into 3 groups using cut points of 18 and 31. ",

He or she can help you create a detailed family tree and find clues to a possible genetic basis for your (or your family's) cancer/s. While BRCA 1 and 2 mutations cause the majority of known genetic breast cancers, there are several other genes that could be the culprit. Cowden's Syndrome (PTEN) was mentioned in an earlier post - there are some very specific external markers of Cowden's and in the absence of those, it would indeed be very strange for a genetic counselor to suspect that. There are also multiple versions of the Myriad Genetics BRCA tests - if you have Ashkenazi Jewish background, they might possibly only test you for the three founder mutations most commonly found in that group. That test is only a few hundred dollars and is also included in the commercially available 23 and me test for only $99. When my genetic counselor initially told me I was BRCA negative, I asked for the written report and saw that they only ran this most basic test. I asked for and received the full sequencing and BART tests and they were also negative. Because I had a stage 0 colorectal cancer at age 30 and ILC at 42, there's a strong suspicion of a genetic component to my cancers so the next step was the Broca (sounds similar to BRCA but is actually the name of a doctor) panel out of U. Of Washington that fully sequences 40 \"oncogenes\". This test takes 12 weeks to get results so I will be waiting until May. My advice to you is to try to get as many details about your family as possible - for cancer, try to find out age and stage at diagnosis, what specific type, etc. Ask about high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiac disease, benign growths and conditions that seem to run in your family, etc. Some hereditary cancer syndromes have distinct benign conditions that go along with them so it's good to mention everything that seems common in your family. The truth is that while we can sequence the entire human genome, we still only understand very small pieces of it. We are all mutants, but only some of those mutations will ever cause a problem (and some are actually protective) - we only know a few of the troublemakers. The genetic counselor should be able to explain what the test can tell you (and what it cannot) and possibly identify tests other than BRCA that might be useful for you. I wish you all the best.",

Until they find a way to identify which tumors are dangerous and which aren't, until they find a way to tell you if you're cured surgically or you have breast cancer cells currently circulating trying to find a home, until there's a cure... \"over treatment\" is not hysteria - it's as valid a choice as any other. After all, how will you ever know if you would've had a different outcome with different treatment decisions? The answer is that you never will. No matter what choices you made as you were thrown into the vortex of a breast cancer diagnosis, please try to be at peace with those decisions. You did the best you could with the information you had at the time. There's nothing more any of us (including the oncologists) could've done.",

The incisions were dictated by my prior lumpectomy. I was under for 5.5 hours for the mastectomy and TE placement. I think the time and incisions are dependent on your PS more than your size. If a dr says that he/she can only put an incision in one specific place, it might very well be that it is the only place that he/she knows how to do it, not that there's a limitation because of your size or the location of the tumor. If you don't like your PS' approach, you might want to find another surgeon, or at least get another opinion. Each dr tends to do what he/she is comfortable with and rarely is open to something else. This is not a criticism - doctors can only do so much and master only so many techniques. Someone who is an expert with alloderm and immediate implants would offer that but someone who only uses TE's and round implants might not want to try - nor would you want them to. I found it very frustrating to try to make these decisions as I never considered cosmetic implants before my diagnosis so I knew nothing about the process. It sounds like you have very specific desires for your outcome so I encourage you to find a surgeon who can make it a reality for you. Have you posted to the implant sizing 101 forum yet? Even though it's for women with TE's already, Whippetmom is really helpful with some of these issues and I encourage you to check it out.

There are no words I can say to make the waiting easier.  You are doing all you can to investigate the lumps and another couple weeks shouldn't make a difference.  If you have any additional symptoms or changes, be sure to let your doctor know so she can decide if it's significant.  Because of your situation as a cancer survivor (I love how you say you \"just\" had a hysterectomy at 29 - I know you mean you didn't need chemo or whatever but it's still a big deal), it's understandable that this is causing you severe anxiety.  Could you ask your doctor for some anxiety meds to help you through the waiting?  Or explain that the stress this is causing you isn't manageable and you need to get in sooner?  Edited to add...  Are you still under the care of an oncologist?  Dealing with possible recurrences and/or new primaries is a survivorship issue and maybe your onc can get you imaged sooner.",

It seems like it takes forever to get test results only to feel like you have to make immediate decisions - the ultimate case of \"hurry up and wait\".

Conservative treatment wasn't helping and I couldn't raise my arm at all if my elbow was bent. The shot worked wonders but the pain started up again last month and now is much worse than before. No sign of LE so far. I don't know if this helps but you weren't getting a lot of responses so I thought I'd chime in. ",

That mutation develops in every cell in your body and can be passed on to your offspring. It is known as a de novo germline mutation - maybe try googling that term. Family history is only one factor when determining whether genetic testing is appropriate for an individual. Sometimes it's based on your ethnic background even if no one has developed cancer in your family. I'm assuming you've received a cancer diagnosis to be asking this - a personal history of cancer is another factor (diagnosed at a young age or certain rare types)",

I went on to have two more lumps removed from my left breast when I was 29 and both turned out to be benign also. When I was 42, I was diagnosed with cancer in the right breast but it was unrelated.   We will not be able to tell you what your doctor is going to recommend - you will have to wait for that appointment.  If he/she does recommend surgery, it will most likely be an outpatient procedure.  I healed quickly from mine.  My mom was a great help during the whole process when I was a teenager.  Do you have someone to support you through this?  You're so young - I hope someone is taking great care of you!  Come back and let us know what the surgeon says.",
