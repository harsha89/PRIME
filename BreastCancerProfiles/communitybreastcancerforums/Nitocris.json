This one really gets you going! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUieo6Mc9EA&feature=related - \"Tummy tone-party zone\" For relaxation: AI CHI (Tai Chi in the water).  Two videos from the Italian Ai Chi Association with Japanese Master Jun Konno.  Good quality videos and relaxing music.  Moves are simple and very soothing.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wje4Y4E1CXA&feature=relmfu - Part I http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anplxTKNIHI&feature=BFa&list=ULWje4Y4E1CXA&lf=mfu_in_order -Part II Ai chi postures can be found on the following web sites: ATRI - Aquatic Therapy and Rehab Institute:  at the end of the following article about meridians http://www.atri.org/articles/Meridians1.pdf   The National Center on Physical Activity and Disability:   http://www.ncpad.org/videos/fact_sheet.php?sheet=425&view=all&print=yes First, I rehearsed all the moves at home to learn them. Then, I  tried Ai Chi twice at the local pool (therapy pool) and I noticed that I definitely get better results in terms of  limb reduction when doing these smooth moves (compared to aquatic exercises) and also in terms of body/mind relaxation.  Definitely, something I will keep on doing regularly., just by myself. If you have your own pool, it is even better.  Enjoy the quietness.... Have fun   ",

I had a session of MLD this morning and I asked my therapist to kinesio tape my knee for support (with wide strips of tape) so I could train today.  That did the trick.  I did 35mn of step aerobic with no problem.  I will keep the tape until this evening and see tomorrow how it looks.  My therapist showed me how to put some kinesio tape for swelling around the knee (fan shaped).  Bonnie, just imagining you bent over that tub doing all these dishes kills my back.  When all the work is over, you can fill that tub with chocolate.  Save a piece for me. ",

Two days, ago, logged in 7709 steps.  Did an old Step Reebo video which I shortened to 25mn instead of the original 58mn. Then did some ab work with a Denise Austin's video from YouTube/BeFit.   Yesterday morning was Latino flavor for exercise.  Did the Dance off the inches video which I posted a while ago \"Tummy Tone-Party Zone\" 38mn (30mn cardio + 7-8mn Ab blaster). Logged in 5348 steps before I \"lost\" my pedometer.  Put it in my pocket when I went shopping, maybe it fell somewhere. Will take it easy today as back is really hurting and muscles are very stiff. Hopefully, not another acute episode of fibromylgia. Have to do something anyway; If I don't move, it's even worse.  Maybe, a 2-3 miles Sansone walk and some AIS (Active Isolated Stretch). Good week-end to all. ",

Austin  \"Ultimate Fat Burn workout\".  This one is more intense, fast paced and not for everybody. You need to be in a rather good shape already to do this.  It's about 20mn long.   Here is the link if you want to try: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52uvwCi03yE&feature=relmfu  After this good boost in, I did the M. Merrithew Pilates \"Mini Flex Ball Workout\" I  posted a while ago.   The four segments last about 39mn.  I love this workout.  It concentrates on the core, the back area and the posture.  The instructor explains very well which muscles are targeted and you really learn how to feel them and isolate them.  One of the best core workout I have tried so far. Have a good day.  ",

It's more in the hot bath temperature range!.   Safe conditions for LE people depends on several factors: - water temperature:  ideally between 31-33°C/ 78.8-91.4F) for ALT; this allows slow limb movements without increasing the swelling.  Immersion alone is likely to be safe up to 35°C(95°F)  - duration of stay in water - type of activity  - medical condition of the person  The higher the water temperature, the more intense the activity and the longer the stay, the more difficult it will become for your body to regulate heat.  This may increase risk of flare-up of lymphedema.  If you noticed some extra swelling and as the water temperature is above the recommended range, you could lower the intensity of some movements, perform them slower and combine deep breathing, or skip some and add your own (as you did with Lebed).  If your arm was OK, then the program was suitable for you.   However, one thing is important: stay hydrated and keep a bottle of water by the side of the pool.  People often don't think that they can get dehydrated in a pool. Unfortunately, Dorit does not have any video on YouTube yet. Maybe in the future, she will make some of her exercises  available there.  Here is a link to a very interesting and informative article from ATRI (Aquatic Therapy and Rehabilitation Institute) about aquatic therapy temperatures:  www.atri.org/articles/Sova-Water Temperature.pdf Another very good link:  Water exercises for lymhedema - LymphNotes http://www.lymphnotes.com/article.php/id/24/  Hope this helps.  Enjoy your next pool session ",

Friday was recovery day, so just did remedial exercises for arm  with a yard Stick  (Norton III). Saturday, I did the Dance off the inches - Tummy Tone-Party Zone DVD which I posted a while ago. The video is fun and it really gets you going.  Did a good half hour of AIS afterward. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUieo6Mc9EA&feature=related - Tummy Tone. Sunday was strength training for arms, chest and back, preceded by 20mn warm-up on elliptical. This morning,  standing abs workout with Kathy Smith (10mn) and this evening rehearsed a fun choreography with the neighbours for our annual crawfish party on Saturday.  We are going to dance \"the Madison\".  Ladies, check these two videos, this is fun and the steps are easy to follow. First video shows the basic steps (1mn),  the only difficulty is a quarter of a turn and a hop at the end.  The second video plays the complete tune. (Chris Anderson; Last night). I saw this group/line dance on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice last June and loved it. Have fun  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEvWD4EJ46Y - steps http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qxm7f8_Urc&feature=results_main&playnext=1&list=PLA8B8938A32B2C29D - music  How about a Flashmob dancing the Madison all wrapped up at the Ohio Summit?",

Screws are holding it together, so I am always careful with certain movement, particularly rotations towards the back.  With Ai Chi, I can perform some rotations like posture 7 and 8 with no pain.  Water supports the whole body and no resistance is used.   Yesterday,  back was pretty jammed so, no samba nor salsa.  Just did \"Dance off the inches - Country Line Dance.  Just focusing on legs.  35mn of good \"Boot scootin' boogie\".  No big sweat but at least I did something.  This morning went to the local pool for our weekly ALT session with my support group.  We finished the session with Ai Chi. (first 7 postures). One of the elderly lady in the group has balance/coordination problems and she enjoyed the \"fluidity\" of the movements.   Fingers of LE hand have been quite stiff lately,  so some extra exercises were needed.  ",

One thing you can also try to optimise your pool session is to do self massage in the water.  In our ALT sessions we always perform two sets of self massages. The first one with arms floating horizontally just below the surface and the last set at the end of the session, with the arm kept vertically in the water.  (hydrostatic pressure at the fingers is greater than the pressure of a compression sleeve when arm is vertical).  Self massage in the water gives a \"final boost\"  and it feels really good.  Be well.  Carol,  With all that traveling, you have become an expert on how to optimize your time in an airport.  You could make a list of how many miles you walk in each airport and we could start a competition \"Beat Carol's record\".  Busy day today.  I could only squeeze in 2km on the elliptical before leaving for Helsinki and 15mn flexi bar exercises and deep breathing when I got back.  Not as much as I would have liked, but better than nothing.  ",

Holidays in southern France were great and LE was alright even though I did not wear my sleeve regularly neither exercised every day.  I decided to take a vacation from LE too and just exercised a bit when I felt like it.  Walking along the \"promenade des Anglais\", enjoying the sun and the sea was enough, plus some remedial exercises and SLD once in a while.  Even though I did not train as much and as regularly as I do at home, LE remained stable throughout the vacation. Maybe sometimes, one just has to let go a bit and not take so much stress about \"having to do something to keep that damned LE under control\".

LE remedial exercises and MLD are part of a regular \"maintenance\" program, so I don't include them in the fitness program. No latino dancing;  lots of hip movements which put more strain on already painful lower back and knees .   So, I will stick to \"regular\" aerobic moves and see how that works.  I am also thinking about getting a rebounder to lower the strain on the spine when training on hard surfaces.  Anyone of you has experience using a rebounder?  Yesterday: cardio and abs - D. Austin  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wye-rJVCg4&feature=relmfu - Cardio fat-burn workout (20mn). Fun and easy to follow.  Better to watch it first to see if you need to diminish the range of movements for arms. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdtNcQteaOs - Abs and core Pilates (15mn)- she uses a towel for assistance which is a +++.  (helps anchor the hips, support the neck for instance).  Lots of moves and not many repetitions for each move could be the minus in this program.  As usual, watch if first and modify to fit your level.   If some moves are too much, just skip them and make more repetitions of the easiest ones.   Found my lost pedometer in the car.  Back on logging in steps... yesterday 8533..not great, but OK. Today, about to start Leslie Sansone 5 miles video. Have a good day",

The main difference between the various models is the design, color, and materials. Some people choose the athletic-looking styles because they have a combination of leather and mesh and tend to breathe better. Some people choose the all-leather shoes or clogs so they can wear them to work where a sneaker is not allowed. Whichever style you choose, the benefits to your body should be the same. It just comes down to choosing the style that you like best! -  MBT shoes are meant to be used for everyday walking, fitness walking and general lifestyle footwear. -  MBT shoes are not recommended for lateral and stop-and-go movements. (tennis basketball, aerobics...).  Instead, you should choose shoes specifically designed for your desired sport. -  Jogging?   Yes, but make sure you run very slowly, have an upright posture, increase the speed with the frequency of your steps and not with a larger step, and that you roll from heel to toe (do not run on the forefoot). -  Back problems? They were designed specifically for the treatment of back pain, rehabilitation and for the prevention of injury. MBT shoes will help to improve posture and muscle activity of the leg and core muscles and therefore, help to take strain off of the back.",

I don't have very much to report about my exercises last week.  We spent most of the time in a summer cottage. Activities consisted mainly of picking up blueberries and mushrooms and lots of arm moves to keep mosquitoes away! Fortunately, I had my \"bug jacket\" on , so I did not get one bite.  Gave up the pedometer as it shows wrong distances.  Yesterday, I cycled 12km, and it showed 2km.  Also did strength training, focusing on biceps, triceps and chest.   This morning, warming up 10mn on elliptical, followed by Pilates \"Mini Flex Ball Workout\". Moira Merrithew is an excellent instructor, giving precise cuing. I have several of her DVDs.  I found this program on Youtube; total length about 40mn.  Great core workout! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VupV4N0MK8&feature=relmfu - Mini Flex Ball Workout - Introduction  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkLaayeELb0&feature=relmfu - part 1 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c67AZVofJ4o&feature=relmfu - part 2  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQlsAomj53w&feature=relmfu - part 3  Have fun   ",

The information that I got varied from one therapist to the other and it was very difficult to have clear answers.  I have seen 3 therapists so far, and every one of them had a different answer.  One said that there was no danger of developing LE on the other side because I still had all the nodes;  the other said that there might be a possibility of developing it and the third said that she had never heard of anybody developing it, but she did not have enough knowledge about it.  Not much help!  Furthermore, none of them mentionned the possibility; if I had not asked the question, I suppose they would have continued draining on that side.  So, I decided to find the answers by myself. I ordered practically all the books published in the US about Lymphedema, spent literally hundred of hours on the internet reading articles, reports,  whatever was written about it.  The more I was learning, the more I realized that  indeed, there was a real risk of having lymphedema on the other side.  I did that operation trusting the surgeon who said there should not be any problem and now here I am wondering if I did a terrible mistake! If I had known that before, I would never have gone through that procedure.   But, now there is no turning the clock back and I have to find solutions and not let the anger upset me too much.  Is it normal that I feel so angry?.  I do self-massage, regular decongestive exercises as well as deep breathing exercises.  I am very meticulous about risk prevention (maybe too much), I wear my compression sleeve on my affected side and the glove when I notice a bit of swelling on the back of my hand.  As a matter of fact, I have recently tried kinesio taping on my hand, and it definitely works!.  It drains better than the glove.  I found a therapist trained in kinesio taping and I would like to try it on my chest and also from the armpit down to the inguinal nodes on my affected side.  I am also thinking that maybe it could help on the side where I had prophylactic mastectomy as a \"preventive\" measure.  Putting tape from  under the scar to the inguinal nodes and also from above the scar to the Terminus to stimulate lymph flow to these areas. The therapist said that I could also try this next time I fly.  Has any of you tried that? Since the prophylactic operation, I have had several controls at the Hospital and local Health centre.  Blood tests and blood pressure were done on that side! Don't they know these things? Thank you Binney for your tip about clearing from above the scar towards the Terminus.  So far, I was clearing across the chest towards the unaffected side, but I am going to change that.  I have one question about my scar.  The doctor said it was not keloid, but it is a hypertrophic one.   I have put silicon gel on it for the last 4 months, but I don't see any difference.  I am planning on trying a scar treatment called LPG therapy. Improvement of the scar and surrounding tissues, might help a bit with the lymph flow in the area.  Apparently, it is also used for peripheral lymphedema. Is this method known in the US?  Has anybody tried this method?  I found an article from the European Journal of Lymphology on the subject. http://www.lpgsystems.com/cosire/pdf/publications/chapitre-3/rub3-pub-c3.4-B.pdf  Well, I have to stop for now.  I have so many questions, that I could stay logged in for several days.  Best regards from snowing Finland.",

Have some of you developped lymphedema on the other side with your lymph nodes intact?. Have you noticed more pooling of lymph in your trunk because of bi-lateral mastectomy?  Thanks for your answers Diagnosis 04.12.2009.

I would think the whole package would cost somewhere between 1300-1500 euros (1600-1900 USD).  I'll ask Mrs. Hildegard about a possible visit to their center when she comes to Finland in August for the Vodder Training. The Földi Klinik does not have a special package, but it seems that the price range would be the same.  However, all costs must be covered prior to the commencement of the treatment and whatever extra costs come during the stay will be added on the final bill.  So,  even though one gets top treatment there, this is way too expensive for the great majority of patients as social security is not covering the cost of such a stay abroad.",

The videos show a drainage sequence toward a healthy axilla on the affected side.   How do you modify when you had SNB or ALND and what do you do when you have arm lymphedema?   Second point, as we always work proximal to distal and back to proximal, once the lower leg/ankle sequence is done, I would think that video No 2 for upper leg and video No.1 for upper body would need to be repeated? It is not said, but it would seem logical. Yes?   MSU also posted an exercise video for the lower extremities.  It is a short video, so you might like to do it to complement the SLD, before, after or both. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYG7ccjfzDg&feature=relmfu   For a longer program, here are two documents with illustrated instructions for exercises for lymphedema of the legs:  patienteducation.osumc.edu/Doc... - from Ohio State University    www.hamiltonhealthsciences.ca/... - from  Juravinski Cancer Centre    What do our experts think about these?    A little bit of \"Me time\" this week-end to watch, read and try these resources.  I definitely need to work on the strokes.... slow and gentle as Binney would say.   Have a good week-end  Diagnosis 04.12.2009.

I was just resting, reading and getting a good tan.  At the time, I did not do self MLD because I did not know much about it.  But what I did was spend a lot of time in the water.  Back then, I did not know how beneficial water can be for LE; it was just natural for me to be in the water.  When I laid down in the sun, I wrapped my arm in a wet towel to keep my arm cool.  I think the water element and the cool towel really helped a lot. ",

About the neck roll backward:  the purpose of  all the neck exercises is to increase the lymph flow through the neck and shoulders with gentle motions.    These are not  full stretches that you hold for a certain amount of time.  Exercise No. 3  is more like a slow and gentle \"Yes\" motion.   (the last picture illustrating  exercise 3 was indeed tilting too much backward; I will remove it. But first I have to find out how to edit a PDF file in Dropbox!).   I need your input to improve this move.  Some modifications are possible: -  Only \"Yes\" moves (gently pumping) -  Forward head rolls: Tilt head to the right without forcing the stretch. Slowly roll the head forward and to the left, finishing with the head tilted to the left. Return to start position. - Chin tucks ( increase lymph flow at the back of the neck and improve head posture). Keep shoulders relaxed. Move head back, keeping the chin tucked in. Hold 1-2 seconds.

I also prepared an English version based on the DVD.  I am putting the link for Part I below to test if this works: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/47710826/NORTON%20EXERCISES%20FOR%20ARM%20LYMPHEDEMA-Part%20I.pdf Lymph drainage exercises are an important part of self-management and should be easily available to many lymphers.  These are clinically accepted therapeutic exercises, but do not replace treatment by a certified professional.  If you are not sure you can perform some of the moves, always ask the opinion of your therapist.  There is also a DVD for lower extremities and genital LE.  Steve Norton demonstrates all the exercises with one arm wrapped up in bandages and his instructions are slow-paced and very clear.   Here is the link where you can find those DVDs in case you are interested. http://www.lymphedemaproducts.com/products/videos.html Steve Norton's material is used with his permission.  Remedial exercises are better performed with compression. Here is an abstract of the National Lymphedema Network regarding Exercises: For Individuals with Lymphedema Exercise as lymphedema treatment (\"Remedial exercise\"): Remedial exercise is an integral part of CDT, the current standard of care for lymphedema reduction and long-term management.13, 14 Exercise enhances lymphatic function through increased lymph and flow. Exercise in Phase I CDT is performed with short-stretch compression bandages on the involved body part to reduce lymph production and maximize the influence of muscle contractions. During Phase II CDT, remedial exercises should be performed on a regular basis with garments or bandages in place. An important component of these exercises is Deep Breathing (abdominal or diaphragmatic).  Here is a  link  where you can learn more about breathing. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/other_treatments_for_lymphedema.htm This is the breathing exercise I to do as often as I can throughout the day: 1. Exhale deeply, contracting the belly. 2. Inhale slowly as you expand the abdomen. 3. Continue inhaling as you expand the chest. 4. Continue inhaling as you raise the shoulders up towards your ears. 5. Hold for a few seconds 6. Exhale in reverse pattern, slowly. Release shoulders, relax chest, contract the belly. 7. Repeat Inhalation and exhalation should be slow, smooth and balanced.  Start with only a few breaths until you feel comfortable with the exercise. Let me know if the link to Part I of the Norton exercises works fine, I will add Part II and III . Take care Diagnosis 04.12.2009.

About 9mn long with a 2mn sequence showing Hand/fingers wrapping. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSBwkGWUcHA&feature=related  Kira, thanks for the J.Zuther link. My daughter used to ride too, but we made a deal that I would take care of the dogs and she would take care of the horse.  So, I never got into the bandaging thing.  For my hand, I use the glove when exercising and flying and I do fingers/hand exercises throughout the day.  I keep small balls of various sizes and textures by my computer and do some exercises while working.  For the moment, that seems enough to keep the swelling down.

These nodes  are the last \"check point\" (filtering) before the lymph is returned to the bloodstream.  Even though there are many nodes in this area, whenever you remove some of them, you create damage which in turn disturbs the flow.   I don't know which is your LE side, but you also mentioned that the doctor checked your cercical nodes on the same side?  Leaves me a bit skeptical???? Even though I would give a lot to get rid of LE, presenting this option as \"decent\" is not good enough for me at present. ",

I am so glad I found you. When I got lymphedema 2 years ago, the situation seemed pretty desperate.  Like many women here in Finland, I was pretty much on my own to deal with that terrible lymphedema.  To give you an idea of the situation, there is not one single lymphedema clinic  in the whole country (public or private), no lymphedema patient's association, no support network, no lymphedema management program, not even a book or leaflet on the subject!!! I have learned so much since then, and the good thing is that I have been able to pass on all that knowledge to other women here.  Last spring I founded the first finnish support group (there are 6 of us so far) and since then we have been meeting regularly and also trying to educate \"lymfa ladies\" (as we call ourselves  here),  particularly about self-management.  And it all started here!",

Lymphedema!!!  That journalist was very interested; she came at my house to interview me and I tried to give her a lot of information about LE and also asked to put my contact details at the  end of the article because my project was to found a much-needed LE support group.  After the article was published, 6 women living in the area contacted me and we started our little group.  I just could not believe the total lack of information they had about the disease, about risk prevention and above all about self-management.  Since then, we have met several times and I have passed on a lot of information I found on this forum and many other web sites quoted on the forum. Last week, we had a second article published in the local newspaper because we signed a petition addressed to the local Health authorities asking that Lymfa therapy be also granted to LE  patients.  The title was \"LE patients don't get helpful lymfa therapy\".  In Finland, we get 2 compression sleeves per year (per person)  but lymfa therapy is denied on the basis that there is no scientific research showing that it works!!! can you believe that????  Once cancer treatments are over, LE patients have to go to private therapists and for some of them, it is just too expensive.  We contacted our local member of parliament and she promised to bring the matter on the agenda of the next City council (which is this week).  We have contacted every member of the Council, explaining about LE and how important Lymfa therapy in the treatment of LE.  Hopefully, our voices will be heard and they will vote some extra money in the budget!!  Let's see.  Even if they don't, at least we are proud of ourselves, because we have done something and brought some attention on lymphedema for the first time! I scaned the articles, but I can't get them in with this post.  After the second article was published, 3 more women contacted us, so our little group is growing.  Hopefully, more will join.  I would like to organize a little workshop about self-management in collaboration with the Breastcancer association because there are no such programs here and it is definitely much needed. It would be also great to get the support of health care professionals... but unfortunately so far, not very many have shown interest.  Anyway, if they don't do anything, we will... in fact we already have.  I will let you know how things develop.  In the meantime, greetings to everybody on the Forum.",

For instance:   Exercise No. 3 - arm raise - she explains to take the healthy arm as far as the weaker arm will go, no further.  This is the first time I have heard this.  This is a very interesting point. I always did the contrary, push my weak arm to match the healthy one.    The ladies on the DV don't seem to have LE and the exercises are used as prevention to promote lymph flow but can also be beneficial for LE people.   Useful videos - Haven at home:   Various videos  including Tai Chi and Yoga, nutrition... worth having a look at.   http://www.thehaven.org.uk/how-we-can-help-you/useful-films-haven-home   The Tai Chi one is great.  It can be used as an opening or closing sequence for clearing the lymphatic pathways in an exercise program or just as a breathing/relaxing exercise during the day.  Explanations of the \"natural or soft limit and mirroring principles\" are very helpful for lymphers too.   Another link you might like to check is the new lymphoedema community site launched by the LSN (Lymphoedema Support Network).  It's called Healthunlocked.   http://lsn.healthunlocked.com   A good day to all.  Send me some sunshine... it's been pouring down non-stop here.  Diagnosis 04.12.2009.

We started two weeks ago a sort of Aqua Lymphatic exercises program based on Dorit Tidhar's method (ALT- Aqua Lymphatic Therapy).   We read all the articles & reports that we could find on the web and with all that information worked out our little program.  Swimming is OK, but it does not specifically target arm lymphedema, neither does water aerobic.  We wanted to optimize our time in the pool and really get the best of it with regard to lymphedema.  I just found out that there are 2 DVDs now available for ALT, one for arm lymphedema and one for leg lymphedema.   Here is the link in case some of you are interested: http://www.aqua-lymphatic-therapy.com/news.html The ALT DVD is also available on the Lymphedema Association of Quebec , but it does not say if it is the arm or the leg DVD.

Why do we have to fight like that to get recognition and proper treatment?  I really understand that some women are so drained by this fight that they just give up.  Anyway, for the moment, our fight continues.  Let's see if  a budget will be alloted for LE treatment for next year.
