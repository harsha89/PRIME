I was exactly the same at first: I obsessed over stats and almost drove myself insane constantly googling. I promise it gets better; ordinary life creeps back up and claims your attention and, impossible as it seems, bc ceases to fill your thoughts. Post your stats and see if anyone shares them..it is very reassuring to see women with similar stats posting years after diagnosis! One last thing: did your oncologist mention that regular exercise cuts the risk of recurrence by up to 40%? Nothing is more helpful for mental wellbeing and also for dealing with the side effects of medication. As soon as you can, get out even for a walk. Keep in touch x",

I've got my legs back under me (ie, I've got my mojo back -) and i try to keep an eye out for anyone who feels now as i did 6 months ago. I am hoping v much it is yet another cyst but whatever it is i know you will be glad you didn't wait another 3 months. Have you told any family or friends?",

I really do think this is maybe the lowest point where you have no clarity regarding your treatment and cannot see a path forward. I hated that sense of bewilderment and dependency and it is really only now beginning to fade.. Then i got definite pathology results, a treatment plan and a prognosis. now that treatment is over, i am trying to adjust to the new normal. I don't know how much you know about your pathology yet but there are some surprisingly low grade subtypes of idc with excellent prognoses. I had a lumpectomy and radiation only and i really hope to leave this behind. Please keep posting. It is very hard at this stage to think of anything else. Please be very sure that if you post, someone will reply. Some of us are half a world away so there is usually someone awake! We are all rooting for you.",

I'm only a few months ahead of you, diagnosed in feb, lumpectomy then rads and now struggling with ai/tamoxifen.i can tell you i was absolutely terrified of the anasthetic and convinced i would die under it. Guess what, i didn't! Afterwards the was surprisingly little pain and i needed v little pain relief. I was driving 3 days later and back at work in a week. I was able to keep working part time through rads. The most annoying thing after a day or so was a nipping feeling under my arm from the sentinal node biopsy but even that didn't last. I wouldn't try too hard to get your house etc sorted if you don't feel up to it. Accept help; in a surprisingly short time you'll be in a position to give it back. Best wishes and every good luck to you.",
