I'd never had one before (not even a fever blister!), but since my port insertion, I've had a red and burning area at the edge of the cut.

I'm having my next round of chemo this Wednesday.Â Scary. But then, can anyone tell me what is not scary about this whole breast cancer process?

The small \"knot\" of bone on top of the shoulder is very tender to the touch, too, although nothing seems hot/swollen/visibly inflamed this time. Is this typical of bone mets?

In the meanwhile, I continue to have intense, deep, aching pain in hips, shoulder, and legs that can only be relieved by Ibuprofen 600 every 4-6 hours. The pain wakes me up nearly every night, sometimes several times. What is going on? I don't understand anything anymore. The oncologist has now prescribed regular X-rays of the femurs, and is keeping me on Xeloda and Zometa. In the meanwhile, I've developed numb chin and lower lip syndrome, even though nothing lit up on the bone scan in the skull or other head areas. Thanks to anyone who cares to respond.

It really goes to show what this site and all you women have become to me that the first thing I did when I got home was to come to the forum to see what was cooking. I didn't cry when I got my diagnosis, but I cried when I read your messages.Â  I'm wondering how standard all the tests my doctor have prescribed are. I think he's figuring my cancer is pretty advanced (although it only appeared suddenly in late November or early December). He has prescribed a bone scan, pelvic and abdominal scan, lung X-ray, blood tests (tumor markers), urinalysis, a Muga scan, EKG, and I don't know what else.Â Is this common procedure? Otherwise of course I'm scared, especially of metastases, but I'll be damned if I'll let this bastard steal away the life I have worked so hard to build! I may go down, but I'll go down fighting. I just never want to go back to camel land again, except to pack up my belongings. I never want to see sheep tied up in front of a butcher shop for days without food and water, waiting forÂ their appointment in Samarra; I never again want to see animal body parts washing down the streets in the rain; people beating skinny horses straining to pull carts that are much too loaded for them; or be toldÂ over and overÂ that I need to convert to Islam.

What I found is that Xeloda is considered promising for brain mets since it's one of the few chemotherapy agents that appears to cross the blood-brain barrier. This might be something everyone here knows already -- I tend, sometimes, to discover medical stuff long after it's old news to my sisters at BC.org. However, in case anyone else is as interested in this piece of news as I am myself, I thought I'd passÂ along the pertinentÂ snippet from the article together with a link to the BrainMets.org site where it's currently posted: One of the more recent agents that has been a focus of attention for its effectiveness against brain metastases is capecitabine (Xeloda), an oral fluoropyrimidine which is converted first by the liver, then intracellularly by the cancer cells into 5-FU, or fluorouricil.Â  It has been reported in Phase II trials to actually cause responses in 20 to 25 percent of patients who have measurable brain metastases.Â  The M.D. Anderson group did report on the combination of Xeloda and Temodar (temozolomide), although it's not clear how much Temodar contributes, since Xeloda alone has also been reported to cause regression in brain metastases.Â  Temodar as a single agent hasn't seemed to be particularly effective against breast cancer brain metastases.Â  The only way to know what the contribution of Temodar is would be to do a randomized trial of Xeloda, with or without Temodar.Â  http://www.brainmetsbc.org/index.php?q=node/42 Love to all, Annie Edited to add yet another link to a study showing complete brain mets response to Xeloda therapy. http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar03nov-21.pdf Annie Camel Tail Dx 2/23/2008, IDC, Stage IV, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I know I've often been a pain in the butt, and that I was concentrating a lot on myself when other people were in equal or greater pain. I'm just home from the hospital where I spent the day with the wonderful t*t man and my sweet mother who came down to be with me too. The diagnosis is triple negative bc; unusual in someone my age. But there it is. I will have the results of the bone scan, tumor markers, pelvic scan, and lung x-ray on Monday when I meet with t*tMouse to discuss protocol in detail. So far, however, he has said he wants to try to shrink the mass through chemo, and will try to get me into some sort of study. This kind of BC is highly aggressive, but he assures me he's not yet lost a single of what he calls his \"triples.\" I hope I won't be the first one. I am so happy to be home -- I guess I'll have to go back to North Africa to wrap things up with the landlord, try to sell some of my furniture etc., but otherwise I'm going to concentrate on getting as strong and well as I can before the fall semester starts in August.
