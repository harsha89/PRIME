I've been able to resume swimming and spinning but I do it in pain. I have the constant \"iron bra\" feeling and the weird itches that do not go away. I saw the recommended FB page (thank you for posting) and will join. Just nice to know I am not alone (all my friends and family think I should be over it b/c I have nice new boobs).",
