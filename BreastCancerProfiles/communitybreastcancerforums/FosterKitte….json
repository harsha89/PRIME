I wore long sleeves and jeans when playing with them. Even so I had a little foster kitten who treated me like a tree and would climb up my legs if I was not careful. I did end up with a long deep scratch on my leg from one of these climbing episodes that did heal, but took a long time. Try to use toys on the end of a long stick if you are playing with kitty and only have kitty on your lap when it is ready for quiet cuddles and sleep. A laser / torch pointer is a really good way to tire out active kittens. Best of luck. Kittens can be frustrating, all claws and teeth but nothing beats a warm furry purring body in your lap or on your chest. And they make you laugh.ðŸ™‚",
