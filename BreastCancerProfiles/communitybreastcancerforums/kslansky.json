SE s have just been fatigue and loss of appetite (mostly during the week of). DH took the clippers to my hair on day 7 for a cropped cut. Day 13, I started shedding, day 15, my hair clogged the shower drain. DH rimmed my hair down to crew cut that evening. I'm still shedding, just shorter and just as itchy. Liking the seal and wrap idea! My MO wrote a p script for a \"cranial prosthesis\", so the insurance would cover the cost of the wig. (My insurance pays up to $500) Headcovers.com has Terry scarf pads and sleep hats. I use the pads under my scarves. covermyhead.com has a nice selection of scarves and has the nylon caps that go under wigs. My MO gave me a list of supplements to take- one was the probiotic called Endomune. I still had the white tongue, but she assured me that it was not thrush, just the dead cells from the lining of my mouth sluffing off. The list also included prevacid. I take it the week of chemo and it really helps the uncomfortable feeling I get after I eat. I also started taking th lentil pm to help me sleep. it even helps the night after chemo (I get the steroids with the anti nausea meds prior to th chemo). Just found this thread yesterday. I've really enjoyed getting into know you all!",

For the Taxol, The nurse put ice mitts and booties on me and switched them out for fresh ones half way through. They were soft cloth covered gel packs. The Taxol took about 3 hours. Wearing the ice packs was painful at first, but tolerable once everything went numb.
