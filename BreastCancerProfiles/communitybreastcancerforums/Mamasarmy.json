I am a stage 4 ER+ breast cancer patient and it has moved to a lymph node, some bone, and pushing the fluid into my pleural area of one lung. I am currently taking ibrance and famara. I just started my second 21 day round. I have a drain in place and they are draining every other day. My question is; when did you see a significant drop in the fluid? I'm getting worried that this is my only chance at time. I have three grown children but young grandchildren. I need time. My family needs time. Thank you, Kathy",
