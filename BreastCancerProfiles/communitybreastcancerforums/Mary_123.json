Take out the tumor, so that it does not constantly send cancer cells to the rest of the body 2. The tumor sends out mets but at the same time keeps them in check and when the primary tumor is removed, the mets start growing uncontrollably. No doctor has been able to tell me that one is better than the other, so I think it is all about how you feel about it and whether your status allows surgery.",
