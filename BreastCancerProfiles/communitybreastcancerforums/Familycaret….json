She had never been diagnosed before this and had been under the care of a totally incompetent primary care Dr who said her illness till then just required her to drink more water and get more exercise over a dozen visits over a year. It was bad, I had to intercede to get even xrays taken when my mother had rib pain and upon finding 7 fractures, the primary care Dr just said, oh she has osteoporosis. Her undiagnosed cancer had spread to her bones and she was almost in a coma from calcium poisoning before I brought her to the emergency room and they diagnosed her there. It is hormone positive and she responded well to the anti hormone treatment till it did not. She looks and feels much better but it has spread to her liver, adrenal gland and perhaps lungs. She has started the oral chemo pill but even with this her CEA reading is increasing and she is feeling sick from the chemo. Her CEA level was pretty stable around 400 while the anti hormone was working. As it began to fail the CEA increased and over the last five months it has basically doubled every three weeks. The end of March it was 3,993, mid April 10,498, beginning of May 16,736 and now the end of last week 30,495. I can't even find online anyone who has had them this high. Her cancer has been spreading the last few months particularly in her liver. My mother does not speak English well and I interact with the cancer Doctor who is great but you know how hesitant they are to say what they really think. Has anyone else dealt with tumor markers this high? Even the Doctors, though they try and hide it, seem very alarmed about the levels. I want my mother to have the best quality time left. There is no one I can talk to about this or even ask about the tumor markers. Has anyone with markers this high had them knocked down and have quality time? Has anyone had CEA levels this high and they did not mean much? Her CA-15-3 is now 2617. Thank you.",
