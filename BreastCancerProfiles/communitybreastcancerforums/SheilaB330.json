A couple of ideas-- make sure that the drain is squeezed, emptied and then put cap on to create a vacuum. So drain should have a caved in appearance. If pain when the drain is stripped, have your helper put some lubricant on fingers before stripping the tube. Hold tube steady in one hand pinching the top so there isn't back pressure, thence strip with other hand down from there, then move steady hand down to that stripped spot and again strip from there. I DO NOT LOOK because seems nauseating to see and hear. :) Luckily my girl friend did it and my husband doing it. Hope this helps.

I am Stage IIIa IDC with 5/11 nodes cancer , 4 extranodal into surrounding tissue. I made my decision based on careful research and meditation and prayer and felt I made it without fear - what a gift. Chose Lumpectomy/partial mastectomy to just get cancer and clean margins and do Sentinel Node Biopsy and take it from there. Now I keep seeing signature diagnosis with others having MX and propalatic MX in other breast with Stage 1 and s lot of nodes removed with none of them cancer. Scares me! Makes me think I should have had a double mastectomy. Told husband I would have made a different choice if I knew it had gotten so seriously scary with extensive cancer in vascular and lymphatic channels that my oncologist says isn't as significant as the cancer in my nodes. He thought that was a depressing thought to dwell on. not dwelling but..Damn scary. Feel like I don't even want to look at signature lines to see what someone else has done, because it seems relatively extreme, but maybe I'm the one who made an extreme choice in the opposite direction. Glad that at least here Stage III others are seriously slammed although my throat chokes up to see how many of you have had more nodes removed with more cancer present. I hope we all survive with no recurrence. Bummed tonight.",

She said many women like to start chemo same day as she can leave a needle in place for the chemo infusion so the woman doesn't need to get the extra stick. I voiced concern I might be really nauseated and she said they would make sure I wasn't by having anti-nausea meds in with chemo and after that we would stay ahead of the nausea just like we did with the pain. My June 12 surgery was for lumpectomy and sentinel node. First try no clean margins on breast so she went far out. First node looked clear but 2 and 3 had cancer. She removed a significant area under my arm. Pathology report the next Tuesday showed my margins were clear on my breast but the cancer was in 5 out if the 11 total nodes they removed. So I am a beginning Stage 3 (IIIa). Anything with the nodes apt to be painful because if the nerves. I had 2 fine needle aspirations and a core needle biopsy done at the time of my breast biopsy and even that much hurt. Talk to your doctor. Sentinel node biopsy so important but there is a very big chance there will be cancer seen and need to remove a larger area to run pathology. I have heard port placement done under general is home same day but NO BIG DEAL like cancer surgery. My best to you and your wife. May she be as pain free as possible as she moves through this process of becoming a BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR! Sheila",

What hits my head with a bomb of fear late at night is concern that if recurrence, it would likely come back at a higher level. So throat constricts and worry that I don't have a lot of room before stage IV. I have generalized anxiety disorder - ya think?! But seriously, though having guided imagery CDs about going through chemo and boosting my immune system I have a a brain that contemplates the worse that can happen so never will I be surprised. Trying to be very positive but there is an undercurrent of this fear \"what if?\" Goal is to get me cancer free. Scared about what signs I may not know about that would lead me to conclude I am high(er) risk of recurrence. Can't do much about recurrence danger? Don't want to allow negativity to be in my brain as believe our will to live and positive attitude is far more helpful. Rambling. 2:05 am. Hard to not be judgmental about my fears but cripes, I have had surgery and one chemo with 7 more and 6 1/2 weeks of radiation but I am already worrying about possible recurrence and no wriggle room to survive it.

Perhaps because my white blood count was already elevated when checked before chemo #2, getting the Nuelasta is boosting it to a level where my bones hurt a bit. Took Advil. Taking Claritin morning and night. Hope all of you are doing ok with aftermath of your most recent treatment. We are halfway through our first course of first half of chemo if having a 4 AC 4 T type schedule. {{{{{hugs}}}}}} Sheila",

Sharp White Cheddar on Pecan flavored Blue Diamond Crackers - sometimes breaking cheese smaller if too cheesy helps. My husband makes me fruit smoothies. Noticing toast just isn't as good. Had enjoyed our farm-fresh eggs scrambled with a little cheese in a toasted sandwich was a filling breakfast. Could only eat a few bites with this this second AC treatment. Hankering for meatloaf, mashed potatoes and green beans a co-worker brought out so that is dinner tonight instead of saving it for a chemo night dinner. Good luck. I will be hungry, open fridge and close fridge.",

So tried Miralax for 2 days along with probiotics and had 4 days of miserable cramping diarrhea and felt like it was kerosene. Have celiac. So took one anti-diarrhea OTC and one of my special anti-spasm gut Rxs. Actually had to take a Dilaudid because was weeping like I had been \"attacked.\" Problem is now day 2 with no poo. Uh oh. I think I need to figure out a natural dietary trick - will try cherries. A co-worker survivor said: 6 oz prune juice, 1 oz orange juice warmed with 1 tsp benefiber. I am just paranoid about triggering runs that are like EXTREME celiac flare up. So my Miralax reactions shared? God, what a lead sentence. Has it come to this: constipation interesting?! :-) Sheila",

Usually some dark night if the soul makes me as you describe. If you meditate, sit with that for what your inner life is churning over. Water - we have well with best water but I bought a 27 oz Menu Water Jug that I keep in the fridge drawer with lime quarters in.

I had surgery first Local now chemo Systemic then will have radiation Local then hormone suppressant because my tumor has positive receptors for estrogen. We are the same broadly but very different sometimes based on how our cancer was behaving. It still surprises me to have had such a relatively small cancer but one that was extensively in lymphatic and vascular system and into lymph nodes 5/11 already spilling out 4 nodes. Did lung, liver, bone scan and wasn't there. Relief. Now chemo is my divine elixir. I could even feel it burning my breast where the cancer was on about day 14. That's what my oncology nurse said the pain meant the chemo was swirling around in there getting rid of whatever left. Swirl away and save my life. A little nausea and constipation and diarrhea is such a cheap price for a cure. Sleep well and we can stand ANYTHING for a few minutes living this cancer treatment phase one day a time.",

Take some Benedryl (typical stength is 25 mg) When I have any allergic reaction I take 2. That is the OTC strength for using it for sleep, so it is not overdosing but you will fall asleep most likely. Benedryl is something to have on hand. Clear Anti-Itch Lotion - sold OTC is very good. When I went through allergy testing they used it after they read my allergic reactions then whiped it on the area and the itchy bumps went right away. So another great thing to try. If you can email your Nurse Navigator it would help or call your oncologist Saturday. Good luck.",

A colleague who had BC and also has arm, breast and truncal lymphadema said she was on antibioics for 3 months before they diagnosed her properly. I have a great lymphadema PT but she has been concentrating on my arm \"to prevent lymphadema\" and the painful cording I have. Bummed. Why do I need to do medical research? I think based on 35 minutes of Internet searching that I have concluded I have breast Lymphadma. Seems like everyone talks round calling it lymphadema - edema, seroma but if it is lymph fluid - it's lymphadema. If I lay on my side, my poor boob picks up wrinkles from the sheets. I don't want any needles poked into my feverish boob!",

There are lots of options and being high risk for recurrence due to 4 of the 5 nodes having spilled cancer into surrounding tissue, I am grateful for chemo and radiation and hormone suppressing treatment. I am turning 59 on 30th and have lots of life to enjoy ahead of me so I am keeping it positive and so far so good: meditation and prayer and lots if amazing support from friends, family, and colleagues who have driven an hour one way to bring meals for chemo night and helping out on our farm. It just blows my mind how much love is out there for us. Surely as powerful a healing treatment as any other we take. Hoping each of you have wonderful days Tuesday August 6.",
