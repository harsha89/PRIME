This was the next day week gone Thu and was referred to BC clinic by them, I'm surprised you had to phone i would ask your GP why they didn't referrer you!! I'm 41 and had my 1st mammogram and ultra-scan yesterday, they didn't see my lump on either but the consultant could feel it straight away so he done a needle biopsy and i get the results tomorrow. The waiting is the worst part, all my family are been very supportive even though im been very angry with everyone! WHY im not sure, but you have been pointed in the right direction i send you big ((((Hugs)))) xx",
