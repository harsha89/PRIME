Injection: A radioative tracer will be injected into your breast, probably right under the nipple. It stings and burns intensely for about a second. Then you sit around while your lymph system distributes the tracer to the nodes. Scan: Painless. MRI locates the node/s that picked up the tracer. You will see them on the screen. Their location will be marked with a magic marker on your skin. MRI needle: Your breast will be injected with a local anesthetic. This stings, too. The wire will be inserted into the cavity or the mass the MRI identifies. I didn't feel the wire insertion at all, but my breast did feel tender while I waited for the next step. Don't look - too weird! Lumpectomy: Will go right in the same site. One of more of the sentinal nodes will be removed and checked immediately. It any are positive, the surgeon will go ahead to remove all the axillary nodes. You will wake up with a separate incision under your arm. I admit I didn't listen when this was explained to me and I was alarmed by everything. Good luck and let us know how it goes!",
