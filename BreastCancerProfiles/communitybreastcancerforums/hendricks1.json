You must be overwhelmed after being diagnosed so recently.   I had a few rounds of chemo (Adriamycin, Cytoxin) before having surgery (I did a lumpectomy in November) and I guess there are arguments for both sides of that, but the good thing for you is that you are positive for both hormones as well as HER2.  That means you have the most treatment options.  Chemo has been pretty easy for me, except for being allergic to Taxol.  Everyone responds differently but I hope it'll be easy for you like it was for me.  Prepare for losing your hair if you take Adriamycin-if your insurance covers it, get a human hair wig.  They are the best and can be colored/cut to look just like yours. Anyway, I thought I'd add one of the lists of good things to buy/tips to our thread.  There's more out there but these are some good things to think about.

Can't lift much of anything-still feel a little weak but am getting more movement and range of motion in my arms.    My first observation scared me-my right breast is somewhat convex but my left was more concave.  I had a lumpectomy in November which left a 4 inch scar on my left side and apparently they had to take that skin out which left me with less to work with. Feel like I'm going to be 1 size off for a little while-probably just slower to expand.  No problems with swelling yet. I've been able to sleep fine in bed on my back-thank goodness for that! And my husband has been great about helping with my drains,bathing, etc.  Go back Tuesday for follow up...I'd say my only downfall in preparation was getting appropriate clothes for after getting home.  It's hot here in MS and though I love the Danskin zip up sweatshirts, they are too warm.  Anyone find anything like that in short sleeves?
