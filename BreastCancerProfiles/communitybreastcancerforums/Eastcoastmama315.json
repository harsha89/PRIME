My back story- About five days ago I noticed a large (about 1/3) of my right breast had a large bruise or skin discoloration that went from the outer edge to my nipple. I thought it seemed odd, but really chalked it up to maybe my bra being too tight and the heat. It was not red, more of a purplish and had a defined outline. There was no rash or bumps. Today, it is still there and now mildly tender to the touch. I also have noticed the feeling in my back shoulder that almost feels like a let down. I last breastfed about six years ago. The area has not changed or diminished, the outer edges may look a little more defined today. I saw my PCP this morning. She is perplexed. She ordered a mamo and prolactin levels. My family history is concering. I have had genetic testing as the BRAC mutation is on my paternal side and I am negative. Although that is negative, my maternal side is not great. My mom passed away from ovarian cancer and my Maternal Grandmother also had breast cancer (although at an older age, she was 70 when diagnosed). Of course googling has not helped :) I am wondering if I need to be more concerned, or if I should insist on an ultrasound pending the mamo results. I understand IBC is extremely rare but my provider doesn't seem to think this is a skin or mastitis issue. Has anyone had anything similar? I am 38 years old. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
