I saw my oncologist a few days ago after an MRI and was told more lesions have grown in my brain which can't be surgically removed. They are going to schedule more full brain radiation in a couple of months. Call me vain but all I could think about was \"O God, my hair has just grown back from the last time\", Has anyone here had ongoing radiation treatment to brain lesions?  I need your support and information.  Does hair grow back a second time. Will I be able to work during the treatments etc?  Thanks, Mel, Western Australia  Log in to post a reply",

Good wishes to you!!  Mel",

My question is - did anyone have whole brain radiation for metastases and what were the side effects?  I find the most upsetting thing is that 3 days after my 10 treatments my hair began to fall out in clumps and continues to do so.  Did anyone lose their hair then have it grow back afterwards?  Any information would be very helpful.  Thanks a bunch, Mel Log in to post a reply",
