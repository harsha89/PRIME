      "Content": "susilv wrote: I have finally completed the chemo portion of m treatment. (triple negative, 4 cm tumor. Taxol/AC regimen. Started in March of 2017, last AC in August). I have had several side effects that are \"not common\" but \"not unheard of\" which has made for an interesting few months. I have had 3rd degree chemo burns on my hands and feet. And the week after my last AC I went septic and came very close to not making it. After 3 weeks, I am home, and my blood levels are good. I have a blood clot, so now i'm on blood thinners as well. They say I'm getting better each day. I have my surgery late September. But I can't eat. Anything, even the smell of it makes me sick to my stomach. If I take a zofran first, I can eat a little, but it still makes me feel bit queasy, and I spend the next couple of hours in and out of the bathroom. I don't know how I'm supposed to build up my energy if I can't eat anything! I can't be the first person to have this problem, right? Any help? I don't want to end up back in the hospital. susilv Diag March 2017/chemo March-August 2017/Stage2 ductile carcinoma, triple negative/upcoming surgery Sept 2017 Dx 3/24/2017, IDC, Right, 4cm, Stage IIA, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I will check on the companzine,and look for a protein powder or supplement. I am unable to eat bread or crackers. It seems to stick in my throat. I have another med that helps, but it puts me to sleep for several hours. If I didn't have a 2 week \"deadline\" so to speak, (that's when surgery is) I would relax and sleep through most of this, and hope it will get better the farther I am away from chemo. Thanx again! It helps just knowing others have had this problem and there are other options. Gives me hope! And gets me of ff the couch.",
