Also, my Oncotype score was 47 - that really threw me, i really thought it was going to tell me i didn't need chemo. Any thoughts are so appreciated. Weezie",

I had my lumpectomy at local hospital 2/5/10, i love the oncologist there whoÂ  is offering TCH. I went to Dana Farber for 2nd opinion and was \"offered\" the trial, but i don't feel so comfortable with the dr. i guess that once i start, i will be dealing more with nurses and not so much doc, i don't know the differences there. this has totally consumed me for weeks now, i don't have forever to decide, not eating or sleeping, please help!!",
