They show up clearly as black circles/ovals. If it didn't show up on ultrasound, it could be a density, a fibroid, fat necrosis, etc. But you should definitely pursue it through other testing until they decide exactly what it is.",

They are wonderful. The place looks like a hotel, they have patient reps checking it to see if you are OK, getting you tea, etc. Very nice, very soothing, very comfortable. I had a thorough manual exam by a CNP who felt that I did have a 6cm lump. She thought it was probably fibrocystic, but on to mammo. The compression mammo was excruciating. Many views. And just so painful I was in hysterics. I've had them before, no problem, but this time it felt like knives were exploding out through my nipples. It was horrific. And that straw-colored fluid started leaking from my nippple--which had never happened before. Every time they released the compression I expected it to stop hurting, but the pain would just build and build. It was unbelievable. They brought me in to the doctor to do the ultrasound. She was so kind. She immediately said that it all appeared to be hormonal fibrocystic changes, but apologized that she needed to do the ultrasound anyway to be extra sure (knowing how much pain I was in). She asked me to show here where the lump was. I tried...and it was GONE! She did the ultrasound, and did find lots of existing cysts, but no loose fluid and the lump was gone. Her best guess is that I had a tightly encapsulated cyst, which burst under the mammo pressure, burst into one of my ducts, and the fluid came out of my nipple. It's very unusual, but can happen, and is the only explanation. But all was clearly benign. Because I have \"difficult\" breasts, I need to stay on top of my annual mammo/ultrasound/CBE schedule, but no more is needed. I'm home and in a lot of pain--a busted cyst/busted duct will do that to you. But it's happy pain!",

If it goes away, I may or may not have it reviewed, depending on how I feel mentally.Your message DEFINITELY helps and I will be sure to post any results, as reading about others B9 diagnoses has helped me a lot. The lump feels much like I once heard someone describe a benign mass--like the tip of my nose. That is, rounded, smooth, sort of firm, but definitely with a good amount of surface \"give\" to it. And unlike my nose, it doesn't stay put when I try to press on it! I guess one thing that is freaking me out came from this board. I switched to Beth Israel--Petrie Division several years ago for my imaging, largely because they had a great rating on several nationwide radiology review boards. And I like that they do follow-up immediately--more mammos, focused ultrasounds, etc.--and have your mammogram and ultrasound done by breast specialist radiologists, and immediately reviewed by breast specialist doctors, before they let you out the door. It usually takes a couple of hours each 6-12 months but it's given me a lot of confidence that I'm being thoroughly checked out before I leave. Then, I saw someone, cookiegal I think, discussing breast cancer options in NYC with someone else...and they said to stay away from Beth Israel! Totally shook my confidence.",

      "Content": "jennem wrote: And no answer last time I posted! I am 39, white, no biological children, no family history of an cancer except colon cancer (grandfather). I have extremely fibrocystic breasts with many cysts, dense tissue, and the occasional small fibroid. I get annual, sometimes biannual, exams with digital mammogram and ultrasound. The last set was 6/2010. Results all benign.These lumps, bumps, and fluctuations have been going on for 12 years, but have been less in recent years. This month I began (unsuccessful) fertility treatments with Clomid/follistim/Lupron. About 9 days after ovulation, I noticed a very large lump (2\"-3\") beneath my right nipple. I had the exact same lump in the exact same place 10 years ago due to an infection/trauma, and it slowly resolved (over a year) but did leave some residual internal scarring and cysts, and does fluctuate a little each cycle. Now it suddenly came back to its old huge size. (It is smooth, moves freely, is not attached to the skin/chest wall, and my skin looks normal.) My doctor suggests seeing a breast surgeon in 2 weeks, after my period next week, if it doesn't resolve, since he feels it's likely from the hormonal stimulation. I will do so, but in the meantime am in a state of utter panic and need to get through the next 2 weeks. All I want to do is Google, check both breasts with my hands, and stare at them in the mirror for skin changes. All day. Obsessively. I've got a job, a husband, and a child, I can't do that! (Child was adopted.) Is my doctor correct in wanting me to wait until any hormonal effects have waned, or should I be rushing to a doctor today? How do I stay calm if \"wait\" is the right answer? Why is it that this is at least the 5th time this has happened in 12 years--including one (benign) lumpectomy, one (benign) aspiration/biopsy, and dozens of other tests--but I'm still convinced this time it's the worst case scenario? Please, support would be appreciated. I called the breast place to get an appointment for the week after next and got nothing but an answering service. And my doctor is not being particularly supportive, as he's not particularly worried--but he didn't even see/feel it, just talked to me on the phone! Log in to post a reply",

And that scare had the SAME exact lump as this one (that's why he thinks this one is a hormonal reaction of the same tissue). I do have to say that it's not that he's not taking it seriously...it's just that he feels nothing can be correctly diagnosed until I'm post-menstrual. Hopefully he will come through quickly on a referral for the breast doctor without seeing me (I just requested that from him) so I can get an appointment made for as soon as my monthly swelling recedes, usually about 3 days after. Blah! Good luck to you!",

He completely supported my hysterical reaction and told me not to beat myself up for being worried, sad, and/or scared. He also stated, absolutely positively, that I have to wait 2 weeks before any further tests or treatments. He suggests meditation or yoga in the meantime. I've had 2 previous, unnecessary surgical procedures, and he feels that if I head to a surgeon right now that's the likely outcome again. Not good for my physical or mental health. His reasoning on waiting: 1) I have extremely fibrocystic breasts. I just had my first month of fertility treatment, that caused my ovaries to produce 4 follicles instead of 1, gave me wicked mood swings and nausea, and now I'm on day 2 of the heaviest period of my life. It's clear that there were hormonal changes in my body, so we need to let those subside before anything can be properly diagnosed. 2) I had a diagnostic (not screening) digital mammogram AND ultrasound in June, at a well-respected clinic. Which were compared with the same tests from 1 year before, and 6 months before that, and 6 months before that. Results were normal/benign--lots of cysts and fibrocystic stuff, but nothing suspicious, come back for routine follow-up in 12 months. 3) This very large lump appeared very suddenly. While I haven't done a self-exam in almost 3 months, this would have been really hard for my husband or I to miss for very long. (And it definitely wasn't there in June when I did the self-exam.) I have A cup breasts and this is 3\"! 4) It's slightly tender and seems to have gotten smaller over the past 2 days, since I started menstruating. 5) The lymph nodes under that arm etc. are totally normal, my skin is normal, the lump is smooth and not adhered to the skin or chest wall. 6) I had a breast infection 10 years ago, from a cat scratch. In the exact same spot, felt exactly the same, same size, came on the same way. There is some possibility that it could have recurred, if it were a particular type of virus or bacteria. He ran blood tests.  My basic issues are that tenderness and shrinking are so important in his diagnosis. It's a LITTLE tender--but is that because I'm poking/pushing it nonstop? And my husband and I both think it shrunk--but is that wishful thinking? It definitely feels flatter and slightly less defined, if that makes any sense...but again, wishful thinking? Overall, in my head, I know that he is right and I have to wait 2 weeks. I've been through this so many times before, and it really did take the 2 full weeks post-menstrual to see a big change. He came right out and said, \"Jennifer, it's not cancer! If it doesn't go away, we'll send you to a surgeon to see what it is, and take care of it, but it's not cancer!\" But I still DO NOT FEEL ANY BETTER! (And he also understands and is very supportive of how I feel. Just not enough to send me to a surgeon who I'd probably talk into operating on probably healthy tissue.)",
