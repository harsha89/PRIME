You are winded because your red count is down. Less oxygen floating around. What I found is that you round corners; meaning you will start feeling better (and be conscious of it) periodically - it builds on itself. Remember you lose muscle mass during chemo and there are hormonal changes to deal with too! I am 15 months post chemo now and in terms of workouts, I am doing what I did before BC. However, my body is not the same. I am in menopause now and rebuilding the muscle mass takes more time than in did in the past. My RO just told me last week that it hasn't been long enough yet. She says give it another 6 months. That puts me close to the 2 year mark... You'll run another race!!!",

The protein powder is called: Protein and Greens by Paradise. 2 scoops gives you 22 g of protein. I use 3 and make it 33gs. In addition to the powder I use a cup of mixed berries (frozen), 2 TBS of FiProFlax by Health from the Sun (another 3 g of protein) and a big handful of whichever greens I have in the house - kale, spinach, chard, etc. Sometimes I throw in a banana or a whole orange. You could also consider Chia Seeds rather than the FiProFlax to mix it up a bit. I use the above as my post-gym breakfast and I really notice a difference! Best wishes for 2013- Stacey",

I find I am either slogging through it, like today, or I am going full boar in my everyday life, no time to contemplate the fear. I had a colleague say to me, during my treatment, that tomorrow is promised to no one. I think, pre-bc, I assumed I would live into my 80's and see my children become adults. I think, the brick wall we all hit with this thing is the realization that there was never a guarantee. What we lost was the ability to go about life under this illusion. My MO nurse once said to me, as I was breaking down while on the table getting ready for my post-treatment scan. Don't let the fear in, Not Here, Not Now, Not Today.  Words to live by...",
