I view it now as a battle scar, a badge of courage. I miss my breast, of course; the best part of my life was raising my 3 kids, and I nursed them. I am used to it now, 8 months out, and don't even really notice it. I too pray for peace for you. It will come. Be kind to yourself. You are still in shock. Melia",

I was up to 120 mg of lasix a day, now seven months out and still on 80mg. My crazy onc said he had never seen it before as a result of taxol, ran all kinds of tests to be sure nothing else was wrong. I knew all along it was the taxol. Surprisingly, what really helped was walking, even though I had no energy and it was the last thing I wanted to do. My daughter is a vet, and she told me that when horses had edema, they are walked, so I figured, what the heck. Even just moving around every hour was a big help. I am trying to wean off the lasix, but even at 80 mg, I feel it a bit in my legs by the end of the day. And I did gain about 10 lbs, but it all came right off. Good luck, it will end one day and you WILL feel better.",

I finished 12 weekly taxols on July 5. I am still on 120 mg lasix (along with potassium) but am just this week experimenting with cutting it to 80. I agree with Carol, exercise really helped. It is miserably uncomforable, and I really sympathise with you, but it will eventually go away. I would ask for more lasix though. My dr still contends it wasn't from the chemo. Yeah, right. The good news is that I am now four months out from treatment, feel great, just a bit stiff. My energy level is good, and I am back to doing everything I did before. You will feel better too.

I did three months of ac, three months of taxol.Â  I was terrified, do not want to minimize in any way what you are all going through. I just want you to know that you can do it. I never told anyone at work about my bc except my boss. One of the reasons I could pull it off was that I bought a great wig, which I wore everyday for 10 months. It is a Sky by Noriko, Ginger color. If any of you want it, I would be happy to mail it to you. Just know that I wore it a lot. I thought it looked great til theÂ  end. PM me and I will send it to you. I do have a big head, so if you are tiny, it is probably too big for you .... but it worked. I am active in the Jan 07 thread. I hope you find the solace and comfort here that I have found. I am such a private person that very few people, outside my family, know of my cancer. I was never a bit ashamed, just didn't want to talk about it to outsiders. Know that there is no right or wrong way to do this journey. But my Jan 07 sisters were, and are, so key to my well-being. Big hugs to all of you. I will help you any way I can. Just pm me with questions ... and let me know if you want the wig. Melia",

I did six months of chemo, 4 ac, 12 weekly taxols. It was hard, but I worked the entire time (I have a desk job, so it was doable). I was mostly very tired, mouth sores, and of course, bald. But my hair is coming back nicely, I feel pretty much back to normal, and I honestly believe if I can do it, anyone can. I didn't have a port either, and I was glad about that. the less surgeries, the better, in my opinion. I do have good veins. Just take it in baby steps, have faith in your strength and decisions, and know that you will get through it and will get your life back. I am on the Jan 07 board, and it was (and is) an enormous source of info, encouragement, and a very safe place to vent. God Bless. Stay strong, and know that you are loved. Melia",

I have been able to control it with the sleeve, gauntlet, massage, and have access to a good certified therapist. However, I was hit with a nasty bout of cellulitis this week. I went back and read LindaLou's post about her experience (LindaLou, you have helped me in ways you will never know, both with this and with my whining when first diagnosed with lymphedema. You too, Binney.) Â Anyway, after three iv treatments and still on oral antibiotics, I am much better. The arm still looks gnarly, but the pain is gone, swelling is subsiding, redness dissipating, etc. My concerns are regarding what to do now. Â First, I am more likely to have this happen again now that it has happened once?Â  How and when do I transition back to wearing the sleeve?Â  I thought I was being really vigilant re scratches, etc, and cannot see any skin break in that arm. This hit me out ofÂ nowhere, while I was across country on a business trip, naturally. Any advice other than normal vigilance about avoiding this happening again?Â  I am going to call the lymphedema therapist with these questions too, but you ladies are at least as knowledgeable as she is. Also, when first diagnosed, I asked about bike riding and was told it was fine. This is a real love of mine. We often ride on weekends, nothing too strenuous, about 20 miles or so. I had gone on a ride the day before the cellulitis hit me. Any opinions on bike riding? I am talking bicycles, not motor bikes. Thanks in advance for the help. I don't remember being that sick or in that much pain. I want to avoid it if I can. Hugs, Melia Log in to post a reply",

By the time I got to the hotel and took off the sleeve, my arm was hard, hot, and red. I started on the antibiotics that I carry with me, and the next morning called my pt. She said I had to see a dr that day. I was flying home anyway, went straight to urgent care, and the dr gave me the first of three iv antibiotics. I had three daily, the last one last night. Now it's very itchy. Is that normal for this problem?Â  It's much much much better, though, still looks red and blotchy, but no pain. So I should start wearing the sleeve again now, or wait until it is all cleared up?Â  If I had caught it earlier, would the oral antibiotics potentially clear it up, or are iv's always needed?Â  I am worried about what happens if this occurs during a camping trip, overseas trip, etc. It got so bad so fast!
