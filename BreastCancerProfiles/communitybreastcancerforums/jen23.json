The biopsy isn't that bad it's a small incision and I'm just sore today. Other than that I'm doing ok, I'm feeling positive that things will work out for the both of us no matter what!",

Now when I had my MRI I had it done at a breast center and I had the results in 10 mins, I couldn't believe it. Hopefully they get back to you today!! I went in for my Ductogram yesterday.. The doc tried for a good 15 mins and couldn't get the needle in so he did another ultrasound. Finally after a mammo, Mri, and 2 ultrasounds he found the mass that has been causing my problems. He ended up doing a biopsy ( my poor boob lol) and HOPEFULLY I'll get the results next week. But there going to my Gynos and their terrible and it's Christmas lol so who knows. I'm pulling for ya! And Happy Birthday!!",

I am having clear sticky discharge from my left breast, mammo, mri, and 1 ultrasound came back inconclusive. So 3 days ago I go in for a ductogram, the doc couldn't get into the duct so he decided to do one more ultrasound. In the middle of it he says \" There it is right there we're doing a biopsy right now.\" So of course I panic..and not a needle biopsy, I'm not sure what it was called but he cut open my breast. He really wouldn't say much so I guess my question is should I be worried due to his urgency? I already was in the first place but this made it worse. I'm doing my best not to think about it and stay positive.. Looking for some input",
