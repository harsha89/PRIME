You will feel much better when you know and start on your treatment plan. There is much to consider in making the choice between surgery types. Each person is unique and has his or her own considerations weighing in the decision. The right choice is the one you make for yourself. In some circumstances, even after mastectomy, radiation may be advisable. Breast reconstruction after mastectomy is much more complicated than putting in some implants. There can be no assurance that reconstruction efforts will be successful. Many mastectomees have complications that necessarily delay or prevent their having breast reconstruction. You are going to hear (and/or read) it stated (or implied) that the big-number statistical studies indicate that the surgery type chosen makes no (appreciable or significant or practical) difference. Those statistical studies generally lump together so many cases of early stages of breast cancer diagnosed within their particular time windows -- whatever types, and whatever ages at diagnosis. Each patient is a person, not a mere statistic, not some fungible unit. Each has his/her own particular cancer type, tumor characteristics, tumor configuration and positioning, disease state, maybe more ongoing or upcoming health concerns, personal circumstances, and other personal concerns unique to him/her. Also keep mindful that (differences in) overall survival rates are to be distinguished from (differences in) recurrence rates, and survival rates are also to be distinguished from disease-free survival rates. Here are some pages you may find helpful__ http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/mast_vs_lump http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/best-surgery-for-early-stage-may-depend-on-age See Beesie's post here__ https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/91/topics/849193?page=1#post_4828669 In the ILC Forum section of this website, you will find many discussion threads from which you can learn a great deal about ILC, including characteristics that you may want to take into account in your deciding on surgery. ILC is more likely than IDC to occur in both breasts, and it has been known to be capable of hiding from mammography, ultrasound, and even MRI imaging. This is not to influence you \u2013 only to inform you.

The OncotypeDx report can be helpful in making the decision about Chemotherapy. I did not meet with my Oncologist until after my OncotypeDx Report had been issued. Chemotherapy was not advised for my case. I have since been on a once-daily pill, an Aromatase Inhibitor. It has been easy treatment for me. I did not seek a second opinion.

A (figurative) roller-coaster of emotions is normal for now. So is having trouble getting to sleep. There will be a lot of times, especially in the nearer term, when you will feel like having a cry or just feel yourself tearing-up a bit. Roll with it. Your husband has suffered the same shock. The diagnosis delivery is always stunning. He and your daughter are welcome to join BCO too if they think it might help them too. It is fine that you have had the Pneumonia vaccination. I think you probably should not have any more vaccinations in the near term, though, unless your Oncologist specifically okays it, and that you should try to avoid contact with any (other) recently vaccinated persons. Whether your treatment is to start with Chemotherapy or with surgery, it is important that you and your household member/s do your best not to catch any communicable diseases that may be going around -- such as respiratory illnesses. Chemo treatments and surgeries are sometimes delayed (from *otherwise ideal* scheduling) because of sicknesses like that. Your Oncology Clinic will likely expect and require you and your accompanying support person to be apparently free of any such illnesses whenever you visit there. I strongly recommend that you discourage and avoid non-essential in-person visits. I strongly recommend also that you and your household member/s do your best to keep out of crowds and also that you get and wear clinical use masks and gloves whenever (any of) you must be around others, until you are all done with any and all surgeries and any and all Chemo treatments and follow-ups therefor. On the bright side, your wearing clinical masks and gloves in any public places will usually get you more \"personal space\" -- and that will help even more to reduce your risks of catching anything that might necessitate delay or interruption of your treatment plans. Pharmacy drive-thru pick-up windows are best for getting your medicines now. Other shopping is best done by mail order or in the stores at like 2 a.m. on Tuesdays, provided, however, that those Tuesdays are not the first day/s of the month/s. You get the idea.",

You and you husband should not have any others, though, unless and until your Oncologist okays it. Before your first Oncology Clinic appointment, inform them (by phone) of your having had that vaccination and the date of your having had it. Many of their patients are immunocompromised and could be endangered by others' recent vaccinations. If you have Chemotherapy, you could be immunocompromised for a long time -- possibly for months and months and more months -- following its completion. Get psyched-up, not psyched-out. Whatever it takes, you can do it! Be sure to inform your Surgeon on Wednesday of the post-nasal cough thing you have going on. You may be given medicine to keep it under control for your surgery. Make a note about it on your reminder list of questions you want to remember to ask on Wednesday, so if that matter has not been covered already, you can have the Surgeon consider and discuss symptom control before your meeting is over. My husband and I kept clinical use masks and gloves in the cars and always wore them in public from January of last year, when we knew I almost certainly had cancer, until my last surgery was done in June. Mercifully, we did not catch any of the sicknesses going around. There were people who wondered and asked why we were masked and gloved, and we told them that we were trying not to catch Zika virus (that was then the subject of so much news coverage).

While the presence of breast cancer in any nearby lymph nodes would technically be (local) metastasis, that is not what is usually meant by the term Metastatic Breast Cancer. You are going to feel much better and much more in control very soon, when the start of your treatment has been planned, and your treatment will then move right along. Until then, it will seem a very long anxious time, kind of like when you were waiting for your biopsy results. Do you have any more information from your Pathology report -- the IHC characteristics of your cancer? If there are no indications of your cancer having metastasized to other areas, your Stage will be determined after your surgery. Any Staging done before then is only provisional and subject to change depending on Pathology results for the tissue to be removed in your surgery. The Surgeon will most likely present and generally describe your surgical treatment options. If you are already decided before then on a surgery type that is among those offered, then the planning of your surgery can start already. Your daughter will most likely take hopefulness cues from you. You will probably feel much better after meeting with your Surgeon. We hope you will. ",

Of course we all hope the changes are nothing serious. Best not to assume anything from others not responding to your questions about commonality of possible symptoms. See the statement up there at the top of this thread:  As an example, one's lump feeling like a cancer patient's lump does not mean that one has cancer. One's lump feeling like someone else's benign lump does not mean that one does not have cancer. Some cancer patients do not have palpable lumps. Some have lumps that seem immobile, or attached to the surrounding tissue, while some have lumps that seem movable. Some lumps are harder, some are softer. Many breast lumps are not cancerous. None of this should make any practical difference to one whose lump (or other breast change) has not been properly evaluated, because nothing about others' disease or non-disease experience would mean that one has or does not have cancer.

I too was thinking that the Doctor must have used the m-word carelessly. In February 2015 my husband caught a terrible cough from someone who claimed that their cough was only from allergy. Two weeks later I too had that terrible cough. That August it was worse than ever, even with our medications therefor (yes, for all those months), and one coughing spell then caused my husband to faint and fall onto his nose. We had that terrible cough from February 2015 through November 2015. [It is still going around out there in our area.] I still shudder to think how something like that might have caused delay in my treatment or might cause delay in any others' treatment -- hypothetical, sure, but you will understand that such possibilities strike me as realistic and dreadful. That is why I urge just-diagnosed members to take great care to try to keep themselves and their household members from catching any illnesses going around. Anyway, yes, there is something of a little universe of different perspectives here at BCO. We all want for you to be as well and as happy as you can be. Happy Easter.",

It is not a substitute for routine care, nor for continuing care for any condition/s.

My husband has a daily reminder alarm function set on his cell phone to remind us that it is time for my Letrozole. As I take the pill, I put a little mark on a date planner calendar there to signify that I have taken my Letrozole for that day. My husband observes and reminds me (as I may need it) to mark the calendar. Soon after that time, I start wondering whether I remembered to take it, so I have to check the calendar for that indication. I make other marks on the calendar to signify dosing with other medicines with which I need to follow my dosing.  https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/78/topics/726592?page=323 ",

Wow, that was fast -- how readily the evaluation process has moved along for you!  When your treatment is planned and underway, you will feel much less anxious.  One part of your treatment -- your surgery -- will be planned from your own decision.  The extent of your surgery is something you must decide for yourself, from the options your Breast Surgeon will recite as appropriate for your case.  If you already know which surgery would be best for you -- I mean, if you are already decided --  by then, then the planning of that part of your treatment can proceed.  Take plenty of quiet, undistracted time alone about it, and decide from your own learning, your own circumstances, and your own concerns which surgical treatment would be best for you.  It is often said that each patient makes the right (best) choice for herself or himself. If by \"genetic testing\" you mean testing of genes in your tumor tissue (?), that generally takes just a few weeks.  Many of us have surgery while that type testing proceeds on our biopsy specimens, and then when we meet later with our Medical Oncologists, those reports have already been made to them, and those reports can help in guiding their treatment recommendations.  Many of us begin treatment with Chemotherapy and have surgery later. We have our Invasive Lobular topics section, as well as other subject matter discussion sections where you will find similarly situated others. ",

Chemo treatments and surgeries are sometimes delayed (from *otherwise ideal* scheduling) because of sicknesses like that. Your Oncology Clinic will likely expect and require you and your accompanying support person to be apparently free of any such illnesses whenever you visit there. I strongly recommend that you discourage and avoid non-essential in-person visits. I strongly recommend also that you and your household members do your best to keep out of crowds and also that you get and wear clinical use masks whenever (any of) you must be around others, until you are all done with any and all surgeries and any and all Chemo treatments and follow-ups therefor. On the bright side, your wearing clinical masks in any public places will usually get you more \"personal space\" -- and that will help even more to reduce your risks of catching anything that might necessitate delay or interruption of your treatment plans. Pharmacy drive-thru pick-up windows are best for getting your medicines now. Other shopping is best done by mail order or in the stores at like 2 a.m. on Tuesdays, provided, however, that those Tuesdays are not the first day/s of the month/s. You get the idea.",

We know this is a very anxious time for you. Remember and remind yourself, you are already doing all that you (practicably) can do just now to have your health concerns checked out. The waiting times for any appointments, procedures, and results news will feel like very long times. For most folks, the waiting times are best passed doing what they really like or love to do -- those things that can so absorb their focus so that the time seems to pass more quickly. Some folks find it more helpful to hang out here on BCO. Keep hope. There are other possible explanations for the changes you are experiencing. We hope the findings will not be anything serious. If it turns out to be breast cancer, it will be treatable. If it turns out to be breast cancer, you can have personal connection with someone who has been similarly situated and has got through (at least much of her) treatment. If it turns out to be breast cancer, I believe there will be help available for transportation for the start of your treatment; and your Doctor/s can order Nursing Care or Home Health Care services for you if you need that type help. No close Others in your life? Who are the \"everyone\" you are driving crazy? -- the Others in your life who are close enough that you have shared with them your fears?

We are very sorry about the concerns that brought you here, but we are glad you found us. The time waiting for your biopsy procedure will feel very long and anxious. Then the time waiting for your Pathology Lab Report -- no matter how short in real time -- will feel very long and anxious. The waiting times would be best passed doing anything you really like or love to do -- those things that can so engage your focus that they make time seem to pass more quickly for you. It is my understanding that most breast biopsies are found to be of benign conditions. Of course we hope yours will turn out to be nothing very serious. At the time of your biopsy procedure, find out how you are to be informed of the findings -- would your usual Doctor be making contact with you? You might also ask whether the suspicious tissue is on or in very close proximity to your chest wall. If you have breast cancer, it would appear to be early stage. Sometimes there is some variance between actual tumor size and the size indicated by medical imaging, and the usual imaging means are not conclusive for ruling out malignancy in lymph nodes. If breast cancer were to be found in your case, then in connection with your treatment surgery, some of your lymph nodes would be removed for evaluation. No matter your biopsy results, you may wish to be referred for genetic testing to find out whether you have any of the presently known hereditable cancer-associated gene mutations. Genetic testing results may have bearing on one's having prophylactic measures and/or higher risk surveillance routines, besides bearing on treatment choices in diagnosed cancer cases. I am so sorry I cannot make the waiting time any easier for you. Please know that you are not alone in what you are experiencing. We have been there too.",

The imaging reports would inform you of the cause/s for suspicion, but they would not settle the question -- whether you have breast cancer. Even in cases of Radiologists' near-certainty (those classified as BIRADS 5), Pathology Lab studies may find that there is no malignancy in the biopsied tissue. That happens sometimes. Only the Pathology Lab results are conclusive on the question. My biopsy specimen was taken on a Friday. The next Friday afternoon I was informed by phone of most of my Pathology results. The next Monday -- two Mondays after my biopsy procedure -- the full Pathology report was issued. The Pathology Lab had been closed for the intervening weekends and local holiday. Yours will probably not take so long, but it will seem that long. Gene Theory says you also got some of your genes through your father. There are now more identified gene mutations associated with familial cancer patterns.

This is the best place on the internet for information, understanding, and support about breast cancer concerns. BCO is a true Community of Brothers and Sisters who understand and care. Yes, the waiting is horrible. The waiting times for any procedures and results always seem very long. The best way to pass the waiting times is to do those things one really loves or likes to do, those things that can hold one's focus so that the time seems to pass more quickly. Even with unusual tiredness, a scare like this -- being informed that one needs a biopsy -- can make it difficult for one to get to sleep. If cancer is found in her biopsy specimen, the Pathology report will indicate its type and characteristics, and we will point out relevant, informative things for you to read to her. She will then decide on a treatment plan, and she will already feel better then, will feel more in control. In that case, there would be a great deal more you could do to help her out. All breast cancer is treatable. All around you are persons who have or have had cancer. You have contact with them in your daily lives. They go on with their lives.",

I do not have RIBP; however, I have and have had some of the same challenges as many RIBP sufferers have or go through among the effects of RIBP. I am a very right-handed person. My abilities are variable but only limited. At the time I make this post, I have a mild degree of truncal lymphedema at at my right side axillary area. My right biceps has been torn for over forty-one years, and my left biceps has been torn for nearly three years. I have had nerve entrapment in my feet for more than eight years; as to my feet, the effects of this overlap and compound the effects of peripheral neuropathy -- from a chronic demyelinating disease -- affecting all my extremities. I have limited arm use; right side back musculature very weakened; limited ability to walk; very limited ability to stand in place; paresthesia in my hands and feet; more extensive nerve damage in my feet; and much more in the way of neurological complications, including but not limited to memory issues and other cognitive impairment, balance issues, and moderate to severe neuropathic pain strikes that may be felt at any part/s of my body. In addition, I have been through a long phase during which any of my limbs might suddenly \"go to sleep\" at any time. I will be doing more posting on this thread to encourage and share some tips with others who may be similarly situated. What follows is my post from Katiejane's recent thread here in our Lymphedema discussions section. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hi Katiejane. I am so sorry you are suffering so with those terrible injuries, besides your same arm being afflicted with lymphedema too. Since my first mastectomy surgery, I have had just a mild degree of truncal lymphedema on one side of my chest, at the axillary area. My biceps injuries preceded my cancer diagnosis and treatment. Your case is much more complicated, as a very troublesome degree of lymphedema affects your injured arm/shoulder, and your injuries in there are clearly more extensive. The biceps tendon in my dominant arm was torn more than forty years ago, in my later childhood. I could not have any treatment for it then, and I had to keep using it then, so it was never capable of healing. Most use of it can still give me the same sharp pains as when the tear was new. With that arm extended at all -- i.e., with my humerus and elbow positioned away from my trunk at all -- it can lift its own weight and about one pound; however, with that arm close against my trunk, I have ordinary lifting strength for a weak, sick person. That side of my back is very weak from all the years of compensation (avoidance, when possible, of the most painful motions), so that if I reach out with that arm (on its own strength) more than just a few times in a while, I get a backache. My posture has naturally been affected too. I do regular passive stretching to keep that shoulder from freezing up. The biceps tendon in my other arm was torn in a very bad fall three winters ago. My arm was frozen stuck down very tightly and painfully for some time, then I gradually recovered wrist and lower arm use, and then the shoulder loosened up a little. For a long time I could wear only very loose kaftans -- to put one on, by dropping that one arm into its armhole first of all; and to take one off, by pushing the rest of the kaftan up overhead and then dropping the kaftan off from that one arm. I could no longer manage with back-closure bras, and front-closure bras were a long, difficult, painful struggle for me to fasten or unfasten, and I still needed help to get the second of my arms into them and to adjust the positioning of their back bands. I had a few steroid shots in that shoulder, and physical therapy, sometimes with battery-charged special dressings following sessions. The strengthening exercises made significant setback for me, though, and after some more weeks I was dropped for not making further progress. The refreshed pain went on, and even after some improvement, that degree of pain returned sometimes over a very long time. I did passive stretching exercises every day unless my arm complained that it was too much, and then I would just rest it for a few days before starting passive stretching again. That arm does not have nearly the range nor the strength it had before the fall that injured it. These days I can manage pulling lightweight covers over myself without too much pain. I believe that shoulder's having had lengthy rests was key to its eventually having its appreciable improvement. I am on pain medicines for the duration, for a quadruple-whammy of painful disabling conditions. You will still naturally tend to use your dominant arm and hand. You will find your very own, better-for-you, adaptive ways of doing what you must do. With some time and practice you may find some particular zig-zaggy way around (not through -- but avoiding) having the most painful (angles among) positions coincide with the most painful arcs in your arm's range of motion. Ordinary closet-rod arrangement is a real bitch. Some kitchen cabinet arrangements can be a real bitch -- but there are lots of practical ways to deal with some of the kitchen challenges. You will very likely become an enthusiast for Universal Design. If you cook, you might want to get a Swedish coil whisk -- it can work from simple wrist action, even from simple fingers action. You will want \"helper handles\" (handles on opposite sides) on any of your larger cookware items. Immersion blenders are much easier to use than countertop blenders. You will want a countertop model microwave oven. If you use a purse, you might want to get a rather small, flattish, lightweight shoulder bag and wear it crossbody style to hang at its easiest-to-handle position on your front side; but using handy pockets or lightweight vests with sufficient handy pockets instead (like fishing type vests, as examples) might be kinder for your shoulder and arm. Wall corners and doorjambs make excellent back-scratchers, and indoors, one can always be found nearby. You will find that some (currently) able-bodied persons seem not to have the capacity to believe in invisible disabilities. Theirs is far worse than yours. ((Hugs))",

[...] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Icietla writes: Go to those stores pretty early on Tuesdays. Point out what all garments you would like to try on, and your husband can collect and carry them for you to the changing room when you are ready to go there. The clothes should be placed on one side of the bench in the handicap changing room, with room for you to sit on the other side of the bench, positioned so that your more capable arm will be closer to the garments. There should also be another seat in there for your husband, so besides assisting you otherwise, he can wait for you to decide on the garments and then he can hang them up as you decide to get them or reject them. You should not need permission to have his assistance in there. You are clearly disabled within the meaning of the ADA. I suggest acting as if you do not need any such permission from store personnel. Men who suffer from this or similar condition might consider the Panabresa/Cubavera/Guayabera type shirts and adopt them as their own style for warm weather and dress shirts. They are available with short sleeves or long sleeves; they are not styled with tuck-in tails (so the absence of a belt beneath is inconspicuous); they are available in large enough sizes to likely permit (overhead, as I generally described) dressing with a kept-fastened front; and they typically have plenty of handy pockets. Bolo ties are appropriate for most dressing-up purposes, and a man having the use of one arm (and hand) can use them without assistance. Here is a fairly simple, no-sew way for concerned helpful others to make for you a loose, pocketed dress from a typical open-front, kimono-style robe having wide armholes and wide sleeves. Whether they are made for men or for women, these robes are all pretty much alike, with some variation as to size and length, and can be found in solids, embroidered solids, stripes, paisleys, foulards, and other prints. Besides chenille ones, garments generally styled like this can be found made of seersucker, other woven cotton, silk, velour, and velvet. [If you want a loose fit, have the belt loops cut off and discard the tie/belt.] Try over and over and over with those central vertical edge sections pinned together (one on top of the other) to make certain of exactly where that band should be closed to afford you both satisfactory chest coverage and enough room to get your head through easily enough. When you are sure of the level for your head opening, your helpful other can close the rest of the front for you using some iron-in adhesive fusing strips. [NB: The iron-in adhesive fusing strips products have very particular instructions as to how long heat should be applied, and also as to leaving a pressed/fused section undisturbed while it cools.] For repurposing robes into dresses like the one shown here, I use two lengths of fusing strips (side by side, generally parallel, but not overlapping each other) between those central edge sections to be fused together.   As Binney4 suggests, capes are the easiest-to-wear outerwear for warmth. If you are shopping for one that is round (or generally round) in its construction, make sure it has some lower front or side holes or slits for your forearms. Here is a fairly lightweight one \u2013 not for the coldest weather -- that is generally rectangular in construction. It is narrow enough so that the sides fall short of being in the way of arm use. To prevent its falling off, its open front can be kept fastened with a single costume jewelry type pin.   For travels in extremely cold places, I wear an all-day cloak fashioned of a folded personal-sized blanket (or throw) put on kind of shawl-like, wrapped around, and pinned through its layers over one of my shoulders. Depending on how such a blanket is folded and wrapped around, it can be worn to hang fairly short to fairly long. I wrap mine so it is short enough at the sides so that it is not in the way of arm use. I can draw in my arms under it for more warmth, and I can bunch much of its length up over my shoulders to use a commode or to vent away excess heat. [Yes, we can take it pretty easy on our arms, shoulders, and backs to comfortably wear even long, even heavy winter capes or cloaks all day.]       ",

I think probably most of us mastectomees who are sighted tend to notice breasts -- breasts, breasts all over, all the time, everywhere we go, everywhere we look, breasts and more breasts. Somehow our not having them can make them conspicuous as they never were to us when we had our own. I am wondering about this group of your husband's friends -- are they close enough friends of your husband that they are aware that you have had mastectomy? Without embarrassing your husband by making reference to his having looked, you might tell the one/s among them closest to you two about the insensitivity and discomfort of that scene -- that what could have been an enjoyable get-together was a very difficult time for you because of that woman's insensitivity and conduct. Respectful, caring persons, once enlightened about your situation and your suffering in that scene, would be thoughtful enough to use influence and/or exclusion (of that woman) to keep that from happening again.

The partial mastectomy procedure takes more surrounding tissue than is typically taken in a lumpectomy.

Here is some very general information on the usual types of breast cancer surgery. http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/mastectomy/what_is I believe radiation treatment is standard treatment following lumpectomy or partial mastectomy. Radiation treatment is also advisable after mastectomy surgery in many cases. Ask your Breast Surgeon questions to make sure you know what you can fairly expect as to your surgery and presently contemplated or likely treatment/s to follow. Since your cancer is known to have an invasive component, at the time of your surgery, some of your nearby lymph nodes will be checked for cancer. I expect you will feel better -- less stressed -- when you have decided on your surgery and it is scheduled. ",

      "Content": "Aug 13, 2018 10:39PM - edited Aug 16, 2018 02:27PM by Icietla Hi Jadedjo. I am thinking a smallish lightweight soft type -- not the heavier, tougher, more rigid type -- canvas bag with two little handle loop straps -- say, just big enough for two smallish loaves of bread -- should work just fine to carry your tightly rolled clothing items and all those other items you would want for your hospital stay. A smallish Tyvek bag would be even lighter. After my drains had been removed -- that was about a week after my last mastectomy surgery -- I was okayed to lift up to two pounds if I were using both arms and hands together. About a week later, I was directed to start with a few simple exercises to help recover my (very limited) reach range, and then I was okayed to lift as much as four pounds -- if using both arms and hands together -- over the next several months. My already very limited arm use was a factor in my lifting restrictions, as well as that my TAH-BSO surgery had been done I think about seven weeks before my last mastectomy surgery. Onions keep well. Potatoes keep well in darkness. Chilled carrots and apples keep well. There are smallish units of easy-to-open prepared foods -- as some examples, some instant soups, some canned soups with pull-off lids, and some small microwavable meals in UHT type packaging (for shelf storage) and having peel-off covers. Barilla brand has some good UHT meals that are meatless and cheeseless. Minute brand UHT-packaged 60-second ready-to-eat Fried Rice is delicious. Small shelf storage cups of plain applesauce with peel-off lids are another possibility for convenience food. These are some type things you might collect over time leading up to your surgery time to set in a good supply so you could take it easier for longer after your return home.",

There is usually an elliptical incision done, and the skin within that elliptical area is taken along with the breast tissue from within.

You should report the lump to your Doctor and have it checked out. Your Doctor should also be informed of the history of breast cancer in your family. We hope the findings will be of nothing serious. Anyone having any change/s of concern in either or both breasts, or in the area of their breasts, is urged to have proper evaluation by qualified Medical Professionals. This website is for information, community, and support. It is not a substitute for Medical Care or Medical Advice. This is a Forum section for persons diagnosed with breast cancer. Newcomers with breast cancer concerns who have not been diagnosed are asked to keep to the Forum section titled Not Diagnosed But Concerned. For persons wondering if they have breast cancer, comparing notes (or symptoms, or characteristics) is not helpful. Your lump feeling like a cancer patient's lump does not mean that you have cancer. Your lump feeling like someone else's benign lump does not mean that you do not have cancer. Some cancer patients do not have palpable lumps. Some have lumps that seem immobile, or attached to the surrounding tissue, while some have lumps that seem movable. Some lumps are harder, some are softer. Many breast lumps are not cancerous. None of this should make any practical difference to you, because nothing about others' disease or non-disease experience would mean that you have or do not have cancer. Does this make sense?",

Whether he could fly with you would depend on particular Airline policies, and also on weather conditions, besides. After your bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction, you must not lift even a small breed doggie in a small travel crate. You can expect to be on strict lifting restrictions for an extended time after your surgery. You can fairly assume that all the pet boarding facilities will shortly be filled (or shortly will have taken reservations to be filled) to capacity because of the upcoming long holiday weekend. Go ahead and get your Little One a nice long reservation -- yes, a few weeks, as you anticipate) for suitably comfortable accommodations for his time away from home. Make this arrangement for him as soon as you can. Take him with his travel crate marked (or tagged) with his name; Take along his accessories (leash, hairbrush, toys, doggie bed and/or blankies, all marked with his name) to which he is well accustomed. Spend appreciable time before with his toys and his blankies (and if he he has a soft-bodied /all-fabric doggie bed, that too) stuffed inside your shirt or other clothing, turned around (or repositioned) often therein, in direct contact with your skin, for his comfort items to absorb a good deal of his Mommie's scent. Take with him an adequate supply of his own food/s, all marked with his name. Prepare (for posting on the door of his enclosure) a largish index card with neat/legible writing (use of a Sharpie marker should be conspicuous enough) with his name; indication of his own supply of food/s having been left there for him; indications of any special needs or care instructions, such as feeding amounts and frequency; indications for any needed food additives; any medications and the dosing schedules therefor; etc. If your Little One uses a (monthly type) topical bug repellent product, and if it has been at least two weeks since his last such application, it is okay to go ahead and accelerate his next such application before he goes to the boarding facility, so he will then have a fresh dose to be effective throughout his stay away from home. If I needed to use any pet boarding service, my first choices would be first-rate Animal Hospitals or first-rate Veterinary Clinics. They would make their best efforts to board apparently healthy animals in segregation from sick ones and/or those having questionable health status. (((Hugs)))",

This is why the disease sometimes shows up again at or along one's skin incision. This is why the needle track site (from a biopsy having had cancerous tissue finding) would be taken in treatment surgery. This is why re-excision is done using the same incision line used before. https://www.cancertreatmentwatch.org/general/biopsies.shtml On another hand, it is believed that a single gram (so this would be per gram, what follows) of cancerous tumor tissue might shed three million circulating tumor cells (CTCs) per day. It is also believed that metastasis may occur very early on in the development of (primary) invasive tumors -- even before a primary tumor is capable of detection by any of the usual medical imaging means. https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/11/cancers-invasion-equation I had excisional biopsy instead of needle biopsy. As with lumpectomies, the need for additional surgery because of diseased margins is not at all unusual -- about twenty percent of all lumpectomies for breast cancer, I think, but with my cancer type, about twenty-five percent, I think. Not all of my margins were \"clean,\" and for the next two weeks, the very fragile tumor tissue remaining was presumably being eroded by blood sloshing against it (I could hear it sloshing) in that blood-filled cavity, presumably putting a veritable soup of it into my bloodstream. There is a medicine that can be administered in connection with surgeries for breast cancer patients that is believed to reduce the likelihood of cancer spread from surgery. It is an NSAID. Ask your Surgeon if Ketorolac would be appropriate for your case. I am not on anticoagulant therapy, but I have long been on the highest permissible human dosing for the NSAID I take. Ketorolac was administered in connection with my last breast surgery, and I had a great deal of apparent internal bleeding -- there was a long-lasting, broad (about 7\" from top to bottom), apparently fluid-congested, purple band (of apparent internal bleeding throughout) across my chest. https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/723293 Consider that for some of the more aggressive breast cancers, other (neoadjuvant) treatment is advisable before having treatment surgery. I understand sentinel nodes are identified from the flow of injected substance. Be aware that in some cases, no particular lymph node/s can be identified as the sentinel node/s. Now there have been identified many more hereditable gene mutations associated with familial cancer patterns. Whether or not there is a finding of breast cancer in your case, you might wish to have full (or fuller) panel testing, because the results may matter as to your (even risk-reducing) treatment options and choices. I am so sorry about your having this anxious time and situation. (((Hugs))) ",

All the waiting times for procedures and results will feel like very long times. I can fairly assure you that your present feeling that time is dragging is a nearly-universal part of (at least the early days of) breast cancer experience. As you get more information and your daughter gets a treatment plan, you will both feel better -- feel that things are more under control, feel that the rest of what must be done about it is proceeding, moving right along. I know you are traumatized from having lost close dear family members, and that you anticipate loss of your doggie to cancer. Please do not envision or assume those outcomes for your daughter's case. All around you -- all around all of us, and in our daily lives -- are persons who have or have had breast cancer. They are living their lives. When she goes back to the Breast Health Center, she can get a copy of her Pathology Report in which her breast cancer diagnosis was made. The biopsy report will have information about the tumor and cell characteristics that would be some of the numerous factors having bearing on the treatment/s to be recommended for her case. After her MRI evaluation, there may be provisional/estimated Staging, or not -- but any Stage guesstimate at this time would be subject to change, depending on the Pathology Report from her (next) Surgery and any other relevant findings. As for others in her life -- in her Community/Communities --, the decisions of whether to share any information -- about her diagnosis, her condition, her treatment/s, any of that -- should be entirely up to your daughter. There are persons theretofore considered Friends who might avoid/shun her. [There are several possible explanations for \"Friends\" and acquaintances responding that way, but to a cancer patient wishing for and expecting support, it is a big disappointment, apparent abandonment, very hurtful.] There are persons who might blame her for having breast cancer. There are persons who might diminish (or make light of) her feelings, fears, concerns. There are persons who might ridicule or condemn her for having conventional Medical Care. There are persons who might ridicule or condemn her for her surgical treatment, whether or not she has options among the Surgery types. There are persons whose morbid or otherwise hurtful assumptions and gossip might reach her children or might reach her through its hurting her children. Etc. It is all very personal, and she should not be put on the defensive for anything about it. Wishes for Peace, Comfort, and Strength for you and your family..",

If any other type/s of breast cancer were to be found within that tissue, that might change the recommendations given for your treatment. Coincident with your surgery, some lymph nodes will be collected, and those will also be evaluated for your Pathology Report. As to whether circulating tumor cells in circulation can be reliably detected, you should ask your Oncologist. It is believed that even very small invasive cancers are capable of shedding CTCs. On your first visit, blood testing will give some baseline readings that will help about evaluating your subsequent blood test results. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/71/topics/860466?page=1 https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/78/topics/859993?page=1",

Then a thin wire guide is put into the breast to lead to the tumor or suspect tissue. Then mammogram views are done to make sure the wire is properly placed. After the surgery it is advisable to wear very supportive bras until the excision seam has healed. At all times until then, except for necessary cleaning times, wearing a very supportive bra with a close-fitting sports bra over it for additional firm support would be good. Without adequate support, the weight and motion of one's breast can cause one's excision seam to open.",

A breast cancer diagnosis is always stunning. Since you are being sent to a Surgeon next, it seems Surgery is contemplated as the first step in her treatment. The Surgeon will generally describe the surgical options. Depending on the Surgery choice, the tumor size, and the tumor positioning, Chemotherapy may be recommended before surgery; and, depending on those and other factors, Radiation Treatment may be recommended after Surgery. Some lymph nodes will be removed at the time of her breast surgery. Her Stage will be determined after her Surgery. If her tumor tissue and disease state meet criteria for OncotypeDx testing, the results from that testing can help guide the decision about Chemotherapy after Surgery. If there is cause to suspect a familial cancer pattern in her case, then genetic testing for known cancer-associated gene mutations should be requested. The results can have some bearing on treatment decisions and on monitoring. I would expect that after her active treatment, she will be advised to take medicine for five or more years. I am going to round up links to some discussion threads that may be helpful. Back soon. ",

Now you need to learn about the surgery options that may be offered to you, depending on the positioning and extent of your diseased tissue. The Surgeon will generally describe your surgery options. Your surgery will be planned readily and your treatment will move right along if you already know by then (have already decided) what type surgery would be your preference. This is something you need to decide for yourself, from your own learning, from your own concerns and considerations that are uniquely yours. Take plenty of quiet time alone to reflect and decide on what would be right for you. I strongly recommend that you get yourself some clinical use masks and wear them whenever you must be in public or in any crowds until the time of your surgery. It would be best if your household members would do the same. Sometimes surgeries have to be delayed because of respiratory illness. Do your best to avoid catching anything of that nature. Once your treatment is underway, you will feel much less anxious, much less lost -- you will feel better.

You should do monthly self-examination, and you should also have regular check-ups with your Doctor examining your breasts. You should inform your Doctor of your family history concerns, in case that will bear on when you are to start having regular medical imaging done on your breasts. When you start having mammograms (and/or ultrasounds), you should continue to have those annually, unless your Doctor advises that they should be more frequent. If you find any changes that concern you, see your Doctor. Depending on the pattern/s of breast and other cancers in your family, you may want to have genetic testing which can identify genes known to be associated with some familial cancer patterns. Understand, though, breast cancer does not require any of those known cancer-associated genes.",

If she had a full course of Radiation Treatment at that breast before, then it would not be customary practice to irradiate it any further. I believe mastectomy would be indicated for her case. Since her breast has invasive disease, I expect that would be modified radical mastectomy -- that is like \"simple\" mastectomy, but with some lymph node collection done in connection with the surgery. Mastectomy substantially reduces -- but does not eliminate -- the risk of local recurrence; however, it may not have any bearing on one's risk of distant recurrence. http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/mastectomy http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/recurrent Grade 2 classification indicates that the tumor tissue biopsied appears to be moderately aggressive. A couple of other things about the report tend to indicate that it might be be more than a little aggressive -- the Ki67 (which may not be a reliable reading, thus not necessarily a reliable indicator); and that there seem to be no Progesterone Receptors (in cases of Estrogen Receptor-positive disease, those are thought to moderate the tumor cells' processing of Estrogen). I do not know the significance of the +2 indication on the HER-2 line. If your Mom's tumor tissue is considered HER-2 negative, she may have genomic assay testing done on the tumor tissue to be removed in her treatment surgery. When there is uncertainty as to the advisability of Chemotherapy, results of these type tests can help with the decision about Chemotherapy. If her tumor is HER-2 positive, she will need a term of HER-2 Targeted Treatment, the start of which is done in connection with Chemotherapy. http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/genomic_assays You will find much good information at (and from) this BCO page here__ http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis Is this biopsy report like her previous one -- is this breast cancer believed to be the same (from the same primary tumor source) as the breast cancer for which she has already had treatment? Did she have Radiation Treatment before -- either before or following her Chemotherapy? Did she have any (anti-) Hormonal Treatment following her other treatment/s? Was any continuing treatment recommended for her case? In what Country does she live?",

This is the best place on the internet for information, understanding, and support about breast cancer concerns. You should report the lump to your Doctor and have it checked out. We hope the findings will be of nothing serious. Anyone having any change/s of concern in either or both breasts, or in the area of their breasts, is urged to have proper evaluation by qualified Medical Professionals. This website is for information, community, and support. It is not a substitute for Medical Care or Medical Advice. For persons wondering if they have breast cancer, comparing notes (or symptoms, or characteristics) is not helpful. Your lump feeling like a cancer patient's lump does not mean that you have cancer. Your lump feeling like someone else's benign lump does not mean that you do not have cancer. Some cancer patients do not have palpable lumps. Some have lumps that seem immobile, or attached to the surrounding tissue, while some have lumps that seem movable. Some lumps are harder, some are softer. Many breast lumps are not cancerous. None of this should make any practical difference to you, because nothing about others' disease or non-disease experience would mean that you have or do not have cancer. Does this make sense?",

I know the diagnosis is always a terrible shock to cancer patients and to those who love them. You will both feel better -- much less anxious -- when she has a treatment plan. In connection with the treatment surgery -- that would be lumpectomy (or partial mastectomy) or mastectomy -- for a breast that is known to have invasive breast cancer, yes, it would be customary practice to remove at least the sentinel node/s for Pathology Laboratory examination. Knowing whether any lymph nodes there are diseased or not can be essential to guide treatment decisions, to have the (likeliest) most effective treatment plan. That information (as to the node/s) is also needed for accurate staging of one's disease state. Whether she needs Radiation Treatment and/or Chemotherapy for this (newly diagnosed) breast cancer will likely depend on numerous considerations, any of which might make the difference as to the treatment/s that would or might be advised. The choice of surgery types can make a difference. The tumor tissue's proximity to the chest wall or the skin can make that difference. Lymphovascular or perineural invasion may make the difference in treatment to be recommended. Diseased nodes can make the difference. For some tumor types/characteristics, Chemotherapy is always recommended. In other cases, though, it may depend on considerations such as tumor IHC characteristics, Stage, nodal status, and Grade -- but the patient's age can make all the difference as to what is recommended. Early stage breast cancers that are both ER+ and HER2- can have OncotypeDx genomic assay testing to help guide in the Chemotherapy decision. For continuing treatment after active treatment, there is Endocrine Therapy (anti-hormonal treatment) for those with hormone receptor-positive cancers. Yes, the Doctors know best.

Remember, for now, she is doing all she can do about it. My guess is that the lump seemed cyst-like in at least some respect/s, so a fine needle aspiration was done to draw fluid from it, but that did not collapse it as a cyst would have collapsed, so a core needle biopsy was done. \"Positive\" would mean that cancer was found in the tissue specimen. The Pathology report would indicate the type of cancer. If it is breast cancer, its type and immunohistological characteristics will be factors taken into account in planning her treatment.",

You have had a long frustrating time of wondering about this, and now you have had the terrible shock of a breast cancer diagnosis. I am so sorry. You need a copy of the Pathology Report in which your breast cancer was diagnosed from your biopsy. You need to know whether the cancer found was in situ cancer or invasive cancer. You need to know some particulars about the tumor tissue characteristics (they will be indicated in the Pathology Report) to know what your next step should be. With some of the more aggressive breast cancers, and also depending on the tumor's location (or positioning), it may be advisable to have chemotherapy treatment before treatment surgery. If you are to have treatment surgery first, and if you would have options among the usual surgery types, you need to consider and decide which type treatment surgery would be your preference. I hope things go better for you tomorrow -- that the Doctor will take your case and your concerns more seriously.

But suspicions and suspicious indications do not necessarily mean that there is cancer. Only a Pathology Lab examination of your biopsy specimen/s can determine that. Do you have a close someone who can accompany you to your meeting with the Surgeon? Are magnification mammograms still as painful as they used to be? I had some back in the mid-1990s. The waiting times for appointments, any procedures, any results will seem like very long times. You may have trouble getting sleep. The waiting times will pass more quickly if you can lose track of time being absorbed in the things you really love or like to do, those things that can hold your focus and make your time seem to fly.",

If their batteries should fail over the next few months, that could be a big problem. Head it off by installing fresh batteries now. You will be on strong pain medicine. Have that medicine supplied in an easy-to-open container. Get your other pills put into easy-to-open containers or dispensers. Eat something -- have at least a little something on your stomach -- and also go to the bathroom before you take the pain medicine. Once you take the pain medicine, you need to stay down and still for at least the next hour following your dosing. Cotton balls and rubbing alcohol (try to get it with a flip-top cap) will be very helpful in your maintenance of your drains. They would also make it easy to keep clean the areas around your wounds or wound dressings. Keep those areas covered -- under clean clothing -- except when you are doing drain maintenance or cleaning the areas around your wounds or wound dressings. You must not fall! You will be at more than the usual risk of falling because of the pain medicine. Your present lower extremity issues also may increase that risk. Your arm use will be severely limited already, and your chest will be seriously injured already. You must not fall! Please have your Doctor order the Hospital to supply you with a walker to take home with you. You want an ordinary walker (not a rollator) having a pair of wheels at its front/leading feet. That would be the safest, easiest, best appliance for your situation. The hospital personnel should make any necessary adjustments to its height for you. Then you must use it whenever you are to be up and about! Best wishes for a smooth great recovery. (((Hugs)))",

Some may leave body parts, or likewise foreign bits thereof, in the sites where they wound us. Some inject stinging toxins. Some wounds bugs make cause itching, and scratching in reaction thereto can cause or spread infection. Fingernails are typically veeeeery dirty. So is hair. I do not go out during or near times of darkness outside. Some aggressive wasps like to hang around and guard some fig trees. Best to stay away from fig trees. Some ticks hang out in tree canopies just watching for critters passing under them, onto whom they can drop. Best not to pass under any tree canopies if you do not need to go under them. Best never to walk along nor near any roadside ditches. There may be worse hazards in those areas. If you have a wasp-nest, hornet-nest, or ground-hornet-nest at your place, have someone deal with it who knows what they are doing. The time to kill those critters by poisoning (properly done with a pressurized jet stream from a distance) and to ruin their nests (render them uninhabitable) is in the evening time, when darkness has set in, when every single last resident of those nests has gone home to settle in for the night. Do not leave home without a cooler carrying ice cubes, frozen bottles of water, or the like. Also, for any travels away from home, always have with you some individually packaged antibacterial towelettes, such as Wet Ones in the individual packages. For home, always have in your freezer some ice and at least a couple of (conforming) Cryogel type cold packs. I have antibacterial bar soaps with Triclosan. I have Band-Aid brand Hurt-Free first aid antiseptic pain relieving liquid for minor wounds. I have Hibiclens type surgical scrub. I have Triple Antibiotic Ointment. Keep some clean tweezers and a good magnifying device. And of course you would want to keep on hand typical sterile wound dressing supplies. With the approval of your Doctor/s, you might keep on hand a course of Augmentin and a course of Cephalexin. Do your best to keep your pet/s protected from bugs. Do your best to keep your pet/s screened from fly access (in your house; on your porch; in their travel crate/s -- drape their travel crate/s with light-colored, lightweight, breathable woven fabric such as cotton muslin). If a fly gets into your home, consider its presence an emergency, and make its eradication your top priority. Using your exterior doors (whether to enter or exit) only in \"airlock\" fashion -- using them only in a series, with either door in the series always being fully closed before the next is opened at all -- will go a long way towards minimizing fly invasions.",

      "Content": "Sep 12, 2016 01:39AM - edited Sep 12, 2016 01:48AM by Icietla Hi Ih1357. I know this is an anxious, dreadful time for you. I have not had reconstruction, so I cannot help about that particular question. I believe the approximate time depends very much on the particular method of reconstruction planned. I am going to add a link to another BCO subject matter discussion area where you will be able to find good information as to that. I recommend reading through the Helpful Links material here, as well as looking through any of the longer monthly threads on members' surgeries. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/91/topics/773030?page=1#idx_1 As to your other questions -- Yes, it is going to hurt, especially just after your surgery. At your mastectomy sites you will likely feel frequent zaps of pain strikes in addition to a steady background pain from being wounded. You will be administered pain medication while you are in the hospital. When you leave the hospital, you will be given a prescription for pain medicine that you are to pick up on your way home. That pain medication should last at least until your first follow-up visit with your Surgeon. If you are going to have implants or tissue expanders put in, you will likely have some temporary swelling and also feel considerable tightness over -- and pressure against -- your chest for some lengthy time. The underarm area from which your lymph nodes are taken for biopsy may be an especially sore area, and for the longest time. Yes, in most cases, the pain is manageable. If it happens that your pain does not subside over time as expected, your Surgeon can help you out about it. Yes, you will need a responsible, able-bodied adult to assist you. You will need that person to get you to your surgery; to wait through your surgery, keeping your ID, etc., safe for you; then before you leave the hospital, to take instruction on care of and recording output of the drains; to take you to have your prescription filled; and to get you home. Once home, you will need help for a time for even some of the smallest manual tasks. You will be very limited -- especially just after surgery -- in what you can do with your hands and arms. With each successive day following, though, you will find that you can do a little more with your hands and arms than the day before. Figure on having someone stay with you to assist you through at least your first few days and nights back home. Even if you are done with your pain medication, you will not be able to drive for as long as your drains are installed. So you will need your support person there to take you to your follow-up visit/s with your Surgeon until your drains have been removed and you have been given the OK to drive. You will have strict lifting limits and other arm use (reach) restrictions for a time. Remind yourself often that your surgery is a huge step forward in your treatment, and that (given your circumstances) you truly wish for your surgery and the rest of your treatment to proceed, and that you are getting it done. You can do this! You can get through this! We are all pulling for you. You are not alone in your situation, nor in your fears. You have come to the best place on the internet for information, support, and real understanding about all manner of breast cancer concerns. We are all Brothers and Sisters here. We care very much. Here is a link to our Breast Reconstruction section, where you can read of others' experiences relating to all types of breast reconstruction procedures: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/44 ",

I am going to post on your thread here some links to some other BCO discussions with information that will likely be helpful to you. Please read through them and also through the content linked therein. I had bilateral mastectomy -- modified radical mastectomy and ALND on the side known to be diseased, and total (simple) mastectomy on the other side. The surgery took down to and including the deep fascia on each side. I was ready to return home about three hours from the start of that surgery. I did not have a Plastic Surgeon following the General Surgeon to tidy up my chest, and I did not have any reconstructive procedures. My arm use is only very limited. For years before my diagnosis, I had been struggling long and hard to fasten and unfasten poorly supportive front-closing bras. I could not put on nor take off back-closing bras without assistance. My breasts were burdensome to me. Even if my breast cancer had been of a type other than ILC, I would have wanted bilateral mastectomy. From ultrasound and mammographic imaging before surgery, my tumor appeared to measure .8 cm. (8 mm). 2.1 cm. (21 mm) of tumor tissue was removed in my excisional biopsy, and there was some more tumor tissue left in my breast until my next surgery. The tumor tissue taken in my first surgery fell apart during measurement, so the total size of my tumor configured as grown could not be determined. The area from which your axillary lymph nodes will be taken may be the sorest area after your surgery, and for the longest time. Prior to the surgery, tracer injections are administered in the most sensitive part of the (diseased) breast. For a half hour prior to the injection procedure, I had EMLA numbing cream and an occlusive cover on the site. I moaned through two of the shots and I screamed through the other three shots. Then I wept. It was by far the worst physical pain I have ever experienced. [This is saying a lot.] Ask the Hospital personnel to do whatever they properly can to make the tracer injection procedure tolerable for you. You may be advised to have chemotherapy. Either a weak positive on progesterone receptors or diseased lymph nodes might make for a chemotherapy recommendation. If any lymph nodes are found to be diseased, or if any tumor tissue is found in very close proximity to the chest wall, that might make for a recommendation of radiation treatment. If there is uncertainty as to need for chemotherapy in addition to a long course of anti-hormonal medicine, OncotypeDx testing may be done, and the results (predicting likely benefit of chemotherapy in addition to endocrine therapy) may help guide that particular decision. Your Doctor can order a longer hospital stay or some home health care visits for you if you would need that. ILC can be very sneaky. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/5/topics/864847?page=1 https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/71/topics/862161?page=1 These discussions cover a lot about preparing for and recovering from mastectomy surgery. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/91/topics/857555?page=1 https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/71/topics/861298?page=1",

Breast cancer diagnosis is always devastating, a very bad shock to the patients and to those who love them. We know the entire experience is scary. And the fears we (personally affected persons) have about cancer are very long-lasting fears. I had the same type surgery -- modified radical mastectomy. I did not have reconstruction. Nobody seems to notice. When I want to make certain that nobody will notice, I wear big scarves (dupattas) draped over my upper body. I understand Radiation Treatments often cause increasing tiredness, and that the resulting tiredness may continue and may increase even for months after the end of one's course of Radiation Treatments. When your Mother's skin is affected by the Radiation, it is very important that she use only skin care products that her Radiation Oncologist specifically approves for her case. Do you know whether some continuing treatment (taking medicine) is planned for your Mother after her Radiation Treatment has been completed?",

I do not think you should be left alone. Besides all the things you will be unable to do, there is one that you must not do -- you must not fall. If you do not have someone who can assist you and watch out for your safety through the first days, please tell your Doctor so a longer hospital stay or some home health care might be arranged for you.",

The biting bugs will likely be attracted by your body's vapors if you are out there where they can smell you. All through the days, there are birds, bugs, and other critters outside eating bugs. Throughout their flight, some flying bugs are continuously eating other flying bugs. All through the nights, there are bats, bugs, and other critters eating flying bugs. I am partial to the racquet-shaped electric flyswatters for household use. There is no swatting motion needed with them. The larger the bug, the more on-and-off (frying repeatedly) needs to be done with the switch/es powering the grid. Easy, bloodless, no mess -- just fry the bug and then tip the flyswatter over a wastebasket. Just never let the (powered) metal grid contact anything metallic, nor any of your flesh. Never wipe the metal grid with anything wet nor damp, either. They must be kept out of the reach of any persons not of sufficient maturity to appreciate their danger and to use them responsibly. Here are some of mine.   JO-5 -- How terrible! I hope you and your daughter will get to feeling much better. Back in the 1990s, before I moved to Panama, I checked with L.L. Bean about anti-bug mesh suitable for draping a bed for protection from mosquitos and smaller flying bugs. At that time, they offered (in their principal store, not in their catalogs) several types in any amount wanted (to be sold off-the-bolt). Marijen -- yes, those are Assassin Bugs. Here is a related discussion thread. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/64/topics/862189?page=1 ",

This page and also the content linked therein should have lots of the type information you want to help get yourself prepared. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/71/topics/861298?page=1#top You will want pull-on pants or jammie bottoms with an elasticized waistband that will permit you to pull your pants (or jammie bottoms) up and down easily with your thumbs. You will be able to wipe yourself. Depending on the resistance of the flushing lever, you will likely be able to flush your commode. Depending on your height, you might want some packaged towelettes for washing your hands and face for a time. If the hospital does not provide you with some recovery garments having drain pouches or pockets, you will want loose (plenty roomy) tops opening at the front, having loose armholes, and having patch pockets on the front side to carry your drains. You will want to wear the tops inside-out so your drains and their hoses are carried inside the tops, where the hoses are less likely to get caught/snagged/pulled by inadvertence.",
