      "Content": "tigr wrote: My mum had breast cancer 2 years ago and had her left breast removed and I happy to say that she is doing ok and a big thank you to all those people including medical staff that helped her out. However two years on she still has some side effects that are constantly bothering her. She undertook chemo and had to take a shorter course as I believe her body didn't eliminate the chemo drugs as fast as other people and she may have become 'too toxic' if I can put it that way. Medically I'll word it as she most likely as a result of that has peripheral nerve damage, and the numbness in here toes and some other extremeties still hasn't resolved.  Not only that, she complains possibly of myalgia (muscle pain) and possible paraesthesia (tingling sensations) randomly. she can't describe it properly but it mainly affects her upper body muscles.  I'm fairly certain this has to do with the damage done to her nerves from the chemotherapy, although probably unavoidable. She says at night she kinds really uncomfortable, stomach cramps, and strange 'uncomfortable' feelings around her neck and arms.  The doctors haven't been able to say much for it and 2 years on this still isn't getting any better.  Does anybody else out there have these symptoms? If so please reply this thread. I will be extremely grateful to hear what you have done to resolve this, or anything to relieve this.  Many thanks! Log in to post a reply",

These tingling sensations would come and go and seem to be more of a problem when I layed down at night.\" Thanks for that. My mother wasn't menopausal, not even semimenopausal before the chemo. After the chemo it bought on the menopause and yes, that did not help things. It's comforting to know my mother isn't the only one experiencing these symptoms, and I heavily believe it is the nerve damage. The question is, has anybody found anything to relieve this?",
