So far so good, and this is on old radiated skin from 15 years ago. Because of the rads, my PS said that it may be difficult for my skin to stretch so I opted to go for tiny tatas. Well a B cup, but that's a lot smaller than most gals go for. I thought the recovery was pretty easy from both surgerys and I would do it again. My PS didn't even have to make an incision on my back, he went through the MX incision, so I didn't have any difficulty sleeping. For most gals, that may be the hardest part.  There are lots of topics to read through on the breast reconstruction forum, some threads wholey on lat flaps.  The only down side for me is the missing lat muscle and the weird sensations I have with many movements. If you have any questions don't hesitate to PM me. Best of luck with upcoming test results. Bobbi",
