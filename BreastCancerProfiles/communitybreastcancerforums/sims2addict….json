I had chemo, surgery, then radiation.  I chose to have a lumpectomy since I have no family history of it and my genetics tests came back negative.  I had a lumpectomy on the left breast and a reduction on the right.  I love my new breast!  Exactly one year after my diagnosis, me and my husband went to Jamaica to celebrate me being cancer free and our 5 yr anniversary!  My hair has grown back enough for me to have braid extentions put in, which helped to bring out my inner diva :-)  Trust me when I say I know how you feel!  Stay positive, it will help you through these times.  Hugs~",
