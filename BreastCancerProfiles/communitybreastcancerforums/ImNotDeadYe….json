I am due to have surgery next Friday, then chemo, then radiotherapy. I am appreciative that there are these treatments available to help me overcome this disease. If I was in a car accident and lost a leg I'd be devastated. If I lost my sight I'd also be devastated. I'm just losing a boob (or part of a boob). I'm not dead yet, it's just breast cancer! Get past the panic by being informed. Research information, speak to your doctor or your contact nurse. The Cancer info lines are really really informative also. It is a stressful, hopless-feeling time, but you are not alone. Grace PS I'm 41 years old",
