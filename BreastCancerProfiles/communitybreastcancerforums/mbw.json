Too, because of other medical conditions including borderline diabetes (for 4 years, I haven't crossed the threshold) and C.L.L, she recommends against flaps and recommends only implants.  From what I read, there are more infections and problems with the implants and I am not sure I want to be bothered....I know for sure that I don't want to be bothered until I am back feeling 100% because I was only just returning to normalcy through PT following knee replacement surgery in September. (Bought my first pair of hiking boots to celebrate --- the morning of the day I was called back for further diagnostics after a mammogram earlier that month).  I am particularly interested in talking to women who either A) chose no reconstruction after a bilateral mastectomy ....or 2) delayed the choice..   I can add that a friend who chose none after a single mastectomy told me her regret was not to have done both to put worries behind her AND so she was balanced when not choosing to wear a prothesis.  Serendipty, I happened to encounter a senior nurse who had been on the BC surgery ward...   After assuring me of the care available, when I told her my dilemma, she said that the nurses often discussed \"what we would do\" after treating people out of surgery and she said that the \"100 we said we wouldn't reconstruct\".   But, I keep worrying that people are telling me what they think I would want to hear and I would love to talk to someone who is or having made the decision not to reconstruct....or at least not right away.  (If I am in the wrong forum please redirect me).  Meanwhile my next step is a follow-up MRI for a MRI-guided biopsy of 3 suspect areas...two in the breast already biopsied and a new one in the left breast....",

Again, my main reason (other than asking about PMP ) is to thank you gals who are giving post surgery feedback and time-lines...It sounds like many of you are back at work at 3 weeks while it took 5 after my knee replacement.  I want to get back into the pool for water aerobics as soon as possible! Any of you know how soon you can get back in a pool post surgery?",
