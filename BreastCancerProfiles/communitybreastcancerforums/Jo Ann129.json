She also said since it is so small I shouldn't worry to much at this point.  It may just be a lymph node. I am scheduled for the retake in 11 days and, as I have read here so many times, the wait is the worst.  Can you help me to understand what an asymmetrical nodule means or could mean.  Thank you for any information you can provide.
