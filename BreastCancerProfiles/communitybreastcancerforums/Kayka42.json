I thankfully tested negative and the lump was something my doctor wasnt concerned with because i Had one on the opposite side as well. Since then I have found multiple small palpable lymph nodes in both armpits in which the doctor also felt and wasn't worried about. I have one that is really freaking me out though because it feels a long. It more so feels like two jelly beans sode by side and about 1.5 cm long. Its very moveable And soft. I have an us in 2 weeks but as a mom of4 im freaking out Log in to post a reply",

I am only 27 so most of what I hear is that I'm too young to worry now that I know I'm brca -. It seems to fit more along the lines with a fibroadenoma. I have no idea how long it's been there as i only noticed when I really started checking a few months ago but it hasn't chanhes in size since then in dont think. My anxiety is just taking overs here. ita been a long hard year.",
