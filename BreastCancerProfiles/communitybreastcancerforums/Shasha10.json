I agree, that I prefer having the results over the phone in order to digest, research and plan. If that's not the case; no matter how strong you are, go with someone. If not your husband, then find someone to be there with you. I was luckly, the radiologist called me with the results.He was very caring. Ask if I was ok? He asked if I had a surgeon and to call him with any questions. He recommended a surgeon. My friend who's a plastic surgeon gave her high marks.  I had to go the first appointment alone. I always had all the reports and information, so I could review everything at home.  You need someone who can listen to your options and make sure you have all the information you need, so you can properly figure out your next step. and if the news is good..celebrate!! As for crying.. I wasn't a crier.. I am now...Let it go.. Good luck till then.. I wish you the best",
