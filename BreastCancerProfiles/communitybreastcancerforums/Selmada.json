My port is also left side (jugular vein). Sounds like we are having a similar protocol - the newer one with Taxol first. I don't know anyone else who was like this (my surgery will be last, after radiation which is after chemo)",

But a single person's experience is not a study. I read where one woman claimed she was cured of cancer by eating a plant based diet. She had a very small tumor removed from her breast and opted out of chemo and radiation and 6 months later was still 'cancer free' and she was giving all the credit to her diet change. Honestly, I would give all the credit to the surgeon who removed the tumor. 6 months is not remission either. So good for her but to promote it as a cure for cancer is beyond misleading and you can bet if her cancer does come back, the place that was promoting her 'cure' wont apologize or admit they were wrong. Once a tumor is removed, chemo and/or radiation is more like insurance. Not everyone will need it, but you don't know if you will or not. My chemo is first because of the size and complications of my tumor. They are still debating if radiation or surgery is next. I can feel, every week the tumor getting smaller, getting softer so I know that chemo works on my tumor. If I had a smaller tumor that was removed first, I honestly don't know what I would have done after. I have very young kids though so I suspect I would still have taken the 'insurance' of chemo and radiation.",

So far, my mouth which had been steady for a while had me thinking that I had too hot a coffee or soup yesterday, but of of course not, just a sore mouth. Losing what is left of my hair faster too and that doesnt usually start until Wednesday. May be an interesting week.",

I seem to be reverse of almost everyone taxol, then AC then radiation then surgery. For me, the first 3-4 weeks were quite easy. I almost felt like a fraud. The benadryl to avoid the allergic reaction put me to sleep for a few hours but that was it. My hair started mass thinning on week 3, and now only the grey is left (I shaved it). But I'm guessing the AC probably took yours already so it may start a slow regrowth of some while on taxol (or not). Starting in week 5 is when I noticed the biggest changes. Fatigue which has been slow to that point slammed into me. I get chemo on Monday and Thursdays totally suck the big one. I've been able to work until now but as of this week am taking Thursdays off and have arranged for people to run my kids ragged on Thursday evenings. This week the joint pain in areas where I already had some arthritis flared up (knees and the thumb on my writing hand are worse). I kinda hobble around. Wednesday is a bit of a ramp up and Friday a ramp down of Thursday. Things could be worse and I know will be on AC but overall weekly Taxol isn't bad most of the days of the week. I've finished 8 of the 12 weekly treatments. Have someone with you the first appointment for sure though to actually watch you. I know a few people who even with the dexamethasome and benadryl still had the allergic reaction (you'll know fast). But it's working so in some ways that makes it \"worth\" it. My tumor is noticeably shrinking and I'm hoping the 8 million or so nodes affected are also seeing the cancer die off. That is what keeps me going, every week.",

Yesterday I had very mild spotting just before my 10th weekly taxel. Seriously?! Like I needed that. So far just the one spotting while wiping but came with cramps so who knows. 2 more taxel weeks then I go to AC every 3 weeks. Nurses and doctors all say I'm tolerating it well. Most days I agree with them but on crash day (3 days after) I would not. I picked up my scripts for the AC cycles and 4 drugs to combat nausea has me a bit concerned!",

I was great until about week 4 then I started having one bad day a week (I got taxol on Monday and Thursdays are bad). My symptoms are very low (tiny bit of neuropothy in feet only, mouth feels like I burned it but no sores, any non-grey hair has fallen out [I shaved the rest]) There is a weekly taxol group on here I'd suggest you join. It's been good for me to read. I failed my blood work before week nine last week but was able to get it today (neutrophils were almost zero, back to the middle). I'm hoping to get through the final three weeks with no more delays going into AC",
