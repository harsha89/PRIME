    "Content": "TsuDhoNimh wrote: I had been diagnosed with a fibroadenoma in my left breast when I was 18 yrs. The doctor told me that I didnt have to worry since it runs in my family and just gave me Vitamin E tablets. After my first pregnancy 8 years later I discovered a lump in my right breast. Since I was lactating, they were not very sure since I was suffering from mastitis too at that time. I underwent an USG three years ago and found two oval well defined hypoechoic lesions in my right breast and three in my left breast. I am scared because just today since I have noticed a small dimple in my left breast and the skin of my nipples have become crusty. I have an appointment with my physician in after a month and the wait is killing me. I have heard that increase in the number of fibroadenomas increases the risk of bc. Is this true?
