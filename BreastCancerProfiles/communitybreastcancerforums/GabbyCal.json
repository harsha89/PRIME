It also says that the score is based on 5 years of Tamoxofin (which I figure is now interpreted to mean whichever HT makes sense). The other thing to factor in that confuses me, is that I think the OncotypeDX score is telling us the % chance that the specific tumor which was tested will recur in a different place in our bodies over the next 10 years. (When they refer to \"distance recurrence\" I think it means recurrence in a different part of your body.)  Does that mean, we actually have 2 recurrence scores, one our % chance of developing more breast cancer and another for this specific cancer spreading someplace else?  kira1234: We've got a lot of notes floating around which can get confusing.

I make through about half the night, then wake up and roll over and bunch the pillow up to keep as much as possible away from my face. It's quite the process. Have you looked into a different kind of imaging other than mammograms? My cancer was found on an MRI and I'm on an annual schedule for that, making me question the value of mammograms for my situation. If they didn't hurt, I wouldn't be questioning. Next time I'm going to tell them I need to do it sitting in a chair.   The Mayo Clinic has developed a procedure called Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) which sounds like it fills a middle ground between a mammogram and MRI. It's especially good for dense breasts. They take two 10-minute images of each breast, but compression is only about 1/3 of that used in a mammogram. Good luck both with the scar tissue and tummy sleeping! ",

I don't have any random pains, but boy, when the area is compressed or anything bumps into it, I jump out of my skin. Take care and hope you have success with the massage. I wonder if we'll hear from anyone else on this issue.  ",

For your peace of mind, it does sound like you'll be getting good news. B9 is good. That said, the doctor is past-due on their call-back account to you. BTW - was there a referring doctor? If so, you might have faster results speaking to their office and letting them know the situation. They could then call the doc who did the biopsy and get your report for you faster. ",

Everyone at the center where I go is extremely nice and caring and there isn't any pain during the procedure, so why the tears?  Is it possible the crying on the way to work is due to the stark realization that while you're trying to carry on a normal life, radiation treatments aren't business as usual and certainly not anything you ever thought you would/should be doing? That's a hard transition to make. I just retired in September, then was diagnosed in December, so I don't speak from first-hand experience. That said, the whole work world is still fresh in my mind.  I think it's good that you're talking to the machine. My nurse friend said that actually helps with treatment success (not so sure how anyone could measure that, but don't care). I do that too.  I've started to do things to make going to/from the treatments a little special. I have a couple routes to take to/from the radiation and I reward myself with the scenic route. Sometimes I stop at a little spot on my way back to my car that has lots of colorful flowers and just enjoy for a few minutes. I hope things get better for you. Know that you're not alone in finding this part of the treatment very emotionally challenging. ",

I remember having a 3-day break from rads was cause for great celebration over Memorial Day. I'm now 3-weeks out from my last rads treatment and can confirm what others are posting here. I've gradually gotten my energy back, skin is making steady progress, I'm still using the Aquaphor on the last remnants of the rash, any clothing that rubs irritates the skin. This week, even the bright magenta boost area is starting to turn more pink than red. The first couple weeks after rads were emotionally draining, partly because I was so ready to turn the page and just be done, but I wasn't done. I decided I'm going to celebrate a second \"last\" day when my skin is cleared up and I'm finally off the Aquaphor.   As to the energy/emotions, during treatment, I was able to \"carry on\" and only hit the wall a few times. I realize now I was just going through the motions, putting my best face forward. The good news is that I realized this because I'm now starting to find happiness in things I enjoy again. That's been missing for months and I had come to the point that I wasn't sure I would ever get it back. GmaFoley - Sorry your DH will be on the road for your last week. Lots of virtual shoulders here for you to lean on. Keep us posted. I'll be thinking of you especially on Friday.  Congratulations Ker and Dolphins! TonLee - Ouch! Hope your skin gets the message \"it's over\" soon and heals up.  ducky - FWIW - This is how I'm approaching the whole AI issue. I've just finished cutting out and zapping the cancer cells. So, theoretically, at this point in time, they're gone. If the job of the AI is to make it more difficult for cells to turn into cancer, this is a good time to start taking it. Make sense? I remember reading up on breast cancer treatments when I was first diagnosed and when I got to the information on hormone therapy, my reaction was \"no way\". Now that I've learned more about everything, I've chosen to embrace it. This isn't saying this is right for everyone, just thought I'd share my current thought process on it.",

He and his colleagues had read through the complete study in great detail. He said that the key element was radiation treatment.  I totally understand how hard it is to accept the idea since it seems to have come out of nowhere at the last minute. Knowing about this study might help ease your mind. I don't know how to put a link in here, but if you search on...breast cancer lymph node study 2011, you should get a link to an article from the New York Times on Feb 8. ",

They tell me to breath \"normally\" so I always try to sort of do that shallow breathing that is more stomach, than lung. Does that make sense? The other thing I do to relax is really embrace the miracle of the technology. I know this might sound odd as who would ever want to do this. But, when I'm on the table, I think about how lucky I am that this technology exists. I mentally imagine all the stray cancer cells getting zapped away.  Glad you got to do both the dry run and first treatment at the same time. I think that means everything went well during the dry run. I think they give themselves the option of a second session for the treatment if they need to do a lot of adjustments after the dry run. ",

Here's what they told me: For the whole breast, they use electrons which go right through you at the same intensity. For the boosts, they use protons and they can control the power of the protons and will set them to disperse before they get to the vital organs.

But that's when I'd get down in the dumps and the crying started. Too much time to think. You do need some time to embrace your feelings to get out of the funk, but I agree you don't want to give up your whole day off to that. How's the weather? If it's a good day is there something you enjoy you can do outside? If all else fails, I always default to anything that gets me out and moving around. That said, I had days when I wanted to go out for a walk, but felt like if I ran into any neighbor who innocently struck up a conversation, I'd break out into tears. On one of those days, I went to the gym to workout, but came back home because I broke down into uncontrollable tears in the locker room.  So, my friend, my advice is to first accept that what you're feeling is normal. Then, find something simple you can do that makes you happy. (For me, this would involve getting out of the house.) ",

One day I got there a little early and a tech from Room B came and said they'd do my treatments because they had time. I was convinced that they gave me someone else's radiation plan. But by then, it was over and done. When I shared my concerns with my husband, he was on my case that I need to call people out when they do something that doesn't seem right. The next day I told the Room A techs my concerns and they assured me I had gotten my treatment. They told me about all the checks and balances during and even after treatment which confirmed that I had indeed gotten the correct treatment. I never went in early again though.

My husband reminded me that it also means the following week, we'll only have 4 treatments before 2 days of rest. Yahoo!! I wanted to share something I came up with yesterday that's helping me in case it might help others. I've got that rash on my chest that itches a lot. I had been doing Aloe in the day and Aquaphor in the night. Whenever I put any clothing over the Aquaphor area, the itching got to be unbearable so I was only doing it at night (and sleeping topless). The rash got to the point where I knew more Aquaphor was the only option. I got some of those \"Hospital Grade Gauze Pads\" that are like several layers of soft gauze folded into a square and put that over the area with the Aquaphor. (rash is about 3\" x 4\"). The Aquaphor itself is sticky enough to hold it in place so no need for tape. On top of it all goes a soft t-shirt. With more Aquaphor time, the rash seems to be getting better.  Enjoy the week-end! ",

I've been using Merona brand from the women's department at Target. Lots of ladies on this thread bought lottery tickets. Number of tickets bought was number of radiation treatments they are scheduled to have. So everyday they get to scratch off a ticket.  Any other fun \"reward\" of something she likes would be appreciated. About half-way through, the whole things starts to wear you down. It feels like it's just never going to end and that's when the skin irritation kicks in. So, if you can think of a way to help her recognize the half-way mark, I think that would be appreciated. BTW - I find people who do weekly countdowns annoying. Hey, you're 10% done! Hey, your 25% done!!!

This isn't about BC, but some of your tales remind me of when my DH had surgery last year. The hospital had a small waiting room for family members to stay during the procedure. This one family took over half the area and stayed long after the doctor came out and spoke with the patient's husband at the end of her surgery. They were carrying on loudly with each other and also on cell phones. It was a zoo. They were so loud, when my DH's surgeon came out to speak with me, he thought I wasn't there so went back to his office without giving me the update. I guess he had called my name, but I hadn't heard it or seen him through this giant family reunion that was going on next to me.  Grrrrrrr!! No incidents so far in the radiation waiting room. There was a little service dog today who was kind of a cutie. Also a guy who was wheeled out of the treatment room on a stretcher hooked up to a couple machines and a half dozen drip bags. They have a TV with CNN which would normally annoy me, but I'm now up to date on the Casey Anthony trial and the Weiner debacle.  ",

Sorry to hear you're getting the max, but also sounds like your RO is up to speed and looking out for your long-term best interests. FWIW - my target area for the whole breast radiation was a triangle over my breast - short side is about 10\" right down my breastbone with the two long sides meeting on my back behind my armpit. When they did the whole breast treatments, they did two \"zaps\". One was from the side and above and the other from below. It was as if the beam was going to the same place, but different directions if that makes sense.   From what we've all shared, I expect the centers we're going to have different types of equipment.  My RO's nurse told me that amount of skin reaction depends on a combination of skin type and amount of surface being treated. Fair skin doesn't necessarily have more reaction. The more surface in the field, the greater the reaction. I read someplace that the reason you shouldn't put lotions or creams on within 2 hours of treatment is that if you do, the unabsorbed cream can act like a bolus, directing the beam closer to the surface of your skin. Talk about precision. ",

Everyone has offered good advice to our newest friends, so I have nothing to add, other than welcome to this friendly and supportive group where it's safe to post any question or frustration. With 3 treatments left, I'm finally allowing myself to do a countdown.  I've still got the red, itchy rash. My RO's nurse gave me a (tiny) sample of Miaderm (www.miaderm.com) to try when I whined about how Aquaphor's greasy mess was getting me down. The home page of their website is interesting as it describes the studies behind the ingredients. It's not Rx. They sell it via their website. As TonTon says, I'm not selling or endorsing this, just passing along the info. (I probably would have bought it a month ago, but am so close to the end, I'll probably just continue with the Aquaphor because I have it on hand.) TonTon - You know so much about the science behind nutrition and exercise. Thanks for sharing your knowledge (no, I DON'T already know lots of it). GmaFoley - Thank you again for sharing what you learned from the nutritionist. I've been eating lots of eggs and salmon and believe it has helped a lot.  Those of you who have finished, I'm curious to know what your next steps are as far as follow-up appointments, tests, etc. Is there some sort of scan or test they do to monitor what the radiation did? Hope you're all having a great week-end. We have an unusually busy week-end and I was a little nervous I'd have enough energy. So far, so good. ",

I was very emotional during rads too, and it lingered after I finished.

(Sometimes I think I feel it starting in my thigh bone.) So, I finished rads 5 days ago and one would think it's time to play Scarlett O'Hara or minimize the image and put it to the side. But irrational brain is telling me if I let down my guard, it will come back. Add to this that everyone in our lives thinks that when we're done with \"active treatments\", we're done.

So it sounds like you'll have a milestone on Thursday with your last whole breast. That's a bigger deal than I thought it would be when I started. So, try counting down just to Thursday and the end of whole breast. Then you'll just have until the next Thursday to be done, done, done.",

I too feel like someone punched me in the chest in the boost area - my cancer was deep also. Over a week out and it still feels that way on and off - if I reach for something using that arm and whenever I yawn, I feel this deep pressing sensation in that area. Now, here's something I did that I don't recommend. I'm a swimmer and stayed out of the pool all during rads. I got the OK from the doc to go back in the pool, but waited until the rash calmed down a bit. On my first big day back in the water, I had a nice little swim, then accidentally let a kick-board pop out of the water and make a direct hit onto my boost area. I'm here to warn you all that area is tender. I don't recommend putting it to the test. I too am in no rush to get back in a bra. I had to pull out one of my old swimsuits with the elastic shot and cut wider than the others. Too much rubbing on tender skin with the regular suits. Hooray to the finishers! ",

They did the radioactive isotope injection exactly 2 hours prior to surgery. When the nurse explained the procedure, she said it would feel hot and painful when the material was injected but that it would be quick because they just inject a tiny bit and once it was in, the pain would go away. The doctor came in and first administered lidocaine and I didn't feel anything.  I asked the nurse how I got so lucky to get lidocaine and she said she didn't know.  No one massaged my breast or told me to massage my breast. Maybe because with my \"boyish figure\" the material didn't have far to go?? No blue dye. ",

I noticed this morning that the non-radiated side seems to absorb the Aquaphor better than the radiated side. I've read that radiation changes the texture of your skin so now I'm wondering if the Aquaphor is also helping to keep the skin softer in the end than it would be without it.

I get a big bag of spinach, wash it up good, then keep the washed spinach in the refrigerator and have it sometimes a couple times a day.

We all can relate to that! It sounds like you're going to a great place in that they even had a nutritionist for you to meet with. I had a very quiet week-end, but had a good long phone chat with one of my oldest, dearest friends who lives a couple time zones away from me this afternoon. She's a nurse and the first thing she said when I told her about my radiation rash was \"did your doctor talk to you about nutrition?\" (I had to say no.) Then she said, eat lots of protein. That's what your skin needs to heal. So, there you go. You did us all a great service by sharing the advice of your nutritionist. I've got that list right here at my side.  I'm so relaxed from having this third day off from radiation, I hope I remember to go tomorrow! Tomorrow is sort of a big day because I've got my first babysitting gig for my first grandchild in the afternoon. He's all of 6 weeks old. I'm brushing up on the lyrics to the old Mary Poppins songs for the occasion.  I think we both have our radiation appointments about the same time of day. I'll be thinking of you and sending positive energy your way when I go tomorrow. ",

I have the setup for boosts today, then boosts start next week Monday. For me, the itching is the worst part. One night last week I was washing dishes and absent-mindedly scratched. I caught myself right away, but had scratched open one of the little blisters. When I got in the shower the next morning, it stung when the water hit it.

During the week-and-a-half of boosts, the skin that was outside the boost zone started healing. It was nice to have the techs, nurses and doc continue to check the rash and provide advice on it during the early healing process. I had a lumpectomy, so the boost area was an oval around the incision. That turned red, but no rash and not burned. They gave me a pillow and I got to lay on a little foam pad instead of on a sheet over the metal table. When I had the setup for the boosts done, the tech explained to me that the whole breast radiation uses electrons which go straight through you (and anything else) at the same intensity. The boosts use protons which can be controlled more precisely so they are not only specifying where they go, but how strong they are for how long. They target exactly the spot they want, then they dissipate. Hope this helps and hope all goes well. Sounds like fate intervened when the doc was running late with your file on the table.  I truly don't think you'll regret it. ",

As to swimming, they said if that's my only exercise it would probably be OK for the first couple weeks, but be sure to rinse the chlorine off really well. I switched to walking and riding a stationary bike instead o swimming from the start just to be safe. I told the nurse I've been using a hair dryer on the COOL setting to speed along the drying of the Aloe Vera Gel. She said be sure it's just cold air, NO HEAT.  Best of luck with your treatments.  ",

When I went for my first setup with the people at the radiation center, the first thing the technician said to me was \"nothing we do here will hurt\". And that has been my experience. I think you'll get a good feel for what the process involved by reading through these posts. Yes, it's an everyday reminder of what you're dealing with. Yes, you'll need to get into a routine of slathering up with creams and lotions.  It's OK to shop around to find an RO and center that you like. When you read through the posts, you'll see that every place seems to do things a little differently. ",

Good for you to take the time you need to get through treatment. Good to hear also your RO's feedback that these feelings of depression, anxiety, etc. are normal. I strongly believe that anyone with a cancer diagnosis who doesn't have these feelings is not normal. Doesn't make it easier, but helps keep me grounded.",

The Aquaphor is so sticky, the gauze sticks without tape. After I get all slathered-up and slap on the gauze, I put on a t-shirt. The t-shirts still get stained around the edges of the gauze, but somehow I feel less icky.  As to getting it off my hands, after a while, I dedicated an old bath towel to the cause. Give it a first try with soap and water, then rub the rest off on the towel.  At first I just did the Aquaphor at night, then needed to also do it on the rash and nipple during the day too. When one of my old friends asked how I was doing, I told her if my biggest issue is stained t-shirts and the ickie factor, must not be doing too badly.",

I was on my back and the boost area was almost in the middle of my chest so I got to just lay on my back with my hands crossed across my tummy. What I can share is that when they did my boosts, I didn't need to be in the exact same position the way I did for the whole breast.  No lining up with the tatoos and tugging on the sheet to get me just \"so\". For the boosts, the machine came in really close to the exact spot and they lined everything up using a little clear, flexible plastic template. The actual zap time was not as long as the whole breast zaps. If I were you and it was really uncomfortable I'd ask the techs about it next time you see them though.",

Clearly, I need to get out more so do need you for my life coach.  TonLee - the Dawn continues to amaze. I squashed a blueberry right on the front of my all-time-favorite soft-but-light yellow bathrobe. I soaked it in the Dawn tub and it mostly came out. Forgot it in there for a couple days (my friends, I'm sure you can relate) and to my amazement, the whole thing came out completely. ",
