Herceptin targets the Her2, and those infusions are given every 3 weeks for a full year. That is the difference between our basic tumor types. The way I remember my doc explaining it, ER+/PR+ alone is slower growing, less aggressive, and responds well to targeted treatments (tamoxifen or other similar drugs). Only 20% of tumors are Her2+. Still, very treatable with targeted therapy. I am thrilled that my surgeon and oncologist both insist this can be cured. No complaining here. There are just so many variations, and different medical approaches, it is hard to keep it all clear! It really helps when everyone includes the information in their signature lines so we know when we are comparing apples to apples, or apples to oranges. I appreciate that feature on this forum! You've got this. Take someone with you on Sunday to help listen and ask questions. I flushed red in my face, neck, and chest last night. My daughter had attended the info session with me, and remembered the nurse talking about that potential side effect. It really helped to have her remember - because I can't remember it all - even though it is all written down. (The flushing is still there today, but less than last night. And I'm a little puffy, but not bad. Again - no complaining from me. I feel really good overall.) If you are really stressed, ask them for some xanax or ativan, and something to help you sleep Sunday night. Trazadone is amazing for sleep, and does not make me groggy. Elizabeth",

Do you have a nurse navigator? Or an oncology nurse in the practice you are going to whom you could sit down and talk to about your questions? They are experts, and they will help guide you through this. Also - look for a support group where you live. Ask your oncology office for a recommendation.

Brain MRI & EEG were normal. No polyps or obstructions. At this point, it doesn't matter what caused it. I am cautiously optimistic that the spray will help. I'm lucky I work for a big health care system and have good insurance. I'm sorry some of you are struggling with the costs. It is sooooo expensive to be sick.

At the hospital 7 1/2 hours with slow infusions. Very tired and ready for bed. Thanks for asking! We will see how the next 2 weeks go, but I am cautiously optimistic. I plan to keep working full time throughout this process, so crossing my fingers for minimal side effects. Crystal... I work in a large, nonprofit, hospital.

In that case, the goal is killing the cancer and shrinking the tumor. On another note - getting IV fluids and meds yesterday made a huge difference for my nausea today! Yahoo!

I loved my hair, but didn't want to go from that to bald without a transition. When my hairdresser cut it short, I tried to smile and stay positive, but inside..... it was hard. Next week, I have an appointment to shave it off, day 14 after my infusion (Dec 21). Based on my cocktail (same as yours, but you are a week ahead of me) and what I've read, it should be coming out pretty good by then. I don't want to be pulling out handfuls through the holiday. My daughters are grown, but I don't want that to stress them out. If a miracle happens, and it isn't bad, I can always postpone the shaving, but the holidays are a tough time to get appointments, and I really don't want to shave it at home. I don't know if I could do it myself, and don't want to ask my husband or kids to shave it for me. Yes Rljes - constipation seems to be a constant battle. And for me, nasuea - big time. Switched to compazine, which is better than the zofran, but still not enough. I'm looking for cbd oil, and calling the doc again tomorrow. Can't remember if I shared this, but my itching ended up being an external yeast infection caused by steroids. MO ordered diflucan, and I have monistat cream for topical use until the diflucan kicks in. This was not listed as a possible side effect on any of my papers, because it doesn't happen often, but he had seen it before. Always ask about your weirdo side effects!

Can't imagine making it through all the infusions of herceptin and perjeta for the rest of the year without a port! I've had the reversible heart damage from the herceptin, so have to keep an eye on my echo-cardiograms. After just 5 treatments, I had to take a 9 week break to allow my ejection fraction to improve. It did... so I've resumed infusions, but I know I'm going to have to take at least one more break before this is over, pushing my infusions into 2019. Since I met my out-of-pocket insurance maximum for the year back in March, I've been taking inventory of what needs \"maintenance\". Saw an orthopedic for my knees last week - chondromalacia patella - so starting steroid injections and physical therapy to fix that. I know I need a colonoscopy, but I'm waiting until radiation is done before I go through that. I figure I've \"paid to play\" for the year - time to get as much done as I can! ",

This is definitely a difficult treatment to go through, and it is even harder without a strong support system to help. That just stinks.

Just started radiation this week. My radiation oncologist says research shows a shorter course (4 weeks) is as effective longterm as the longer course (6 weeks) which has been the standard, so I am only doing 4 weeks. So far, so good, but I understand the effects of radiation is cumulative and I should expect fatigue. (That will just piggyback on my fatigue from the herceptin!)

Congratulate yourself for getting through so much. <3 Rljes - yes to radiation. Fourth chemo coming up this week. Getting IV Infusions with steroids and anti-emetics several times in between treatments made a huge difference for me. I actually felt more like myself this week than I have in ages. It's gotta be the steroids giving me energy (and a puffy face!). I've decided to do genetic testing. My doc originally said I didn't qualify because of my age. But I have Ashkenazi heritage, and that automatically qualifies me for testing. My daughters are 24 and 26. I have 4 sisters and lots of nieces. They all need to know if we have the gene so they know how vigilant to be. Has anyone else done it? I've been wrapping my head in scarves... just could not deal with wigs. I post my \"wrap of the day\" on Facebook for friends and family, and they have been amazingly supportive. Here is yesterday's wrap, which is made from recycled saris. It's one of my favorites.

My doctor is adding it to my last two chemos, and for the rest of the year with the herceptin. I appreciate that research is constantly being done to improve the treatments available for cancer.

I trust my doctors, and my prognosis is excellent. more than once, both my surgeon and oncologist have said this can be cured. I feel very lucky. This is no picnic. But I can do anything short-term. And a year or so is no big thing. My father died at 51, after having a third of his body amputated due to bone cancer. I was just a teenager then. At 52, I have already outlived him. And this will NOT screw with my life or my peace of mind. Blair2 - yes. The difference must be her2. My meds are based on being triple positive. I had a delay in getting my lumpectomy because I had cellulitis in my finger on the same side as my breast cancer. We had to wait until the infection was resolved. Surgery was supposed to be 9/22. I finally had it 11/2. The tumor increased from 7mm to 1.6 cm in that short time. Still small, and an early catch, but the growth was from the her2, which is more aggressive. ER/PR positive makes it less aggressive. That change just reinforces to me how lucky I am that we caught this so early. Mammograms really do save lives! Peace everyone. Breathe. We've got this!

I can postpone if I still have a lot of hair, but it don't want it falling out all over the place on Christmas. So I have a bit of a dilemma right now. Going to take it one day at a time. For the record, with all these pictures of bald heads, I see beautiful faces. The absence of hair allows us to see each other with less distraction. Each of you is gorgeous. I really mean that!",

I get plenty of iron without meat. But Hope99, you may have other things going on that affect your iron absorption. Please seek out professional opinions from your doctor.

I spent two days in the hospital last round to get the nausea under control. This time, my docs added emend to my pre-chemo meds (IV), and marinol (synthetic marijuana pills) for at home. I now have a standing appointment on Mondays for IV fluids and anti-emetics. I am very hopeful that this will work. Today is day 3 after chemo 3 - the day the nausea tends to hit me hard. Crossing my fingers and trying to stay hydrated! I did not have bone scans, as there was no lymph node involvement, and my tumor was caught small and early. I know the docs have extensive guidelines to review concerning what tests, meds, and protocols are called for depending upon the individual patient's variables. It is always good to ask why they make the choices that they do, and to push for answers. Don't underestimate the damage that fall could have done to your back. Chemo interferes with healing. Had you fallen and hurt yourself under normal circumstances, your back would probably be fine by now. But chemo complicates everything, and stops our normal body processes. Remember, those drugs attack all the fast growing cells - which includes healing mechanisms. Having said that, I would want some sort of MRI or other imaging to see exactly what is going on in there. There is a good chance it is just damaged from the fall. And that would give you a little peace of mind. Totally worth it.",

The real difference (as I understand it) is that we get herceptin infusions every 21 days for a full year, after our chemo has ended. Herceptin is not supposed to have as bad of side effects as the chemo drugs. My MO tends to blame every bad thing I have on the Taxotere. Started an antibiotic this afternoon to deal with the infection at the site of my lymph node dissection. Seeing the surgeon in the morning. I suspect that she will drain it and send out for labs to see what is going on in there. Unfortunately, chemo wipes out the body's natural defenses. Under normal circumstances, our bodies could fight off infections and exposure to some of these bacteria. Chemo makes that impossible, and so we end up with complications. My oncologist said he will check my labs Thursday morning and decide whether to postpone my third chemo or go ahead as scheduled at that point. I'll be more than 24 hours into the antibiotic, so as long as my white blood cell count is okay, I will be surprised if he postpones. No fever... just pain and inflammation at the site. I'm sorry to hear about all the difficulties people are having right now. Chemo is hard enough without complications with the IV, multiple needle sticks, chemical burns, etc. I am grateful for my port.

If you think counseling could help you with this transition, do it! There are lots of women here who can offer support, but each of us reacts differently. It's okay to feel sad, frustrated, angry... Or whatever feelings you have. Just know that you will get through this with the help of friends here, and friends and family around you. ❤️",

Clinical trials showed that, in combination with herceptin, there is a benefit to using perjeta for HER2+ early stage and smaller tumors, and it was literally approved by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for use for expanded usage this January. My oncologist added it to my treatment plan in February, but of course, we had to wait for insurance to approve it. (eye-rolling! - I hate the insurance game.) It was added to my March 1 treatment, and will continue with the herceptin after chemo has ended. You may want to ask your oncologist about it. I hope that helps!",

Happy Birthday Iris! Yesterday, we attended my daughter's college graduation. I wore a hat there, but it was so warm outside, I took it off as soon as I got in the car. My head was too hot and sweaty! We had a big cookout and bonfire at our house that evening, and the hat never went back on. I am getting more confident about my bald head, but I like the option of a soft hat when I'm around a lot of strangers. At work, a naked head is just fine with me. The heart damage from herceptin reversed, as my oncologist predicted, so I've resumed those infusions. Just 11 more to go, but I suspect I'll have to take another break as my heart function decreases again. I'm just glad it isn't permanent. Radiation consultation is scheduled. Gotta keep moving forward through these treatments. I look forward to the day when they are all over! Who else is having bad edema? So annoying! Happy spring everybody!",
