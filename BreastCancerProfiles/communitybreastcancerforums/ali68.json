I still worry about a recurrence but not because of the Lumpectomy only because of my stage and grade. The way I see it is, I have a high chance it may come back so whatever I did it will happen. All I know is I couldn't face losing my breast and even if my Cancer returns I would still have another Lumpectomy. My friends said I was mad but it felt right for me and I knew from the start that's what I wanted.",

I can chat to any stage and give three cheers to someone who has not got BC because one less person going through this makes me happy. Will I be Cancer free and will it come back? Yes I want to be Cancer free and if it does come back then I start again. If you can't deal with people who have a lower stage then to be honest you have not come to terms with Cancer and I really feel for you.

Came home the next day and on the way home asked if I wanted to go shopping with my fucking drains in. I think you have to talked to your DH because its you who needs the support. All I can say is think of yourself because you have to be happy or what's it all for. I am 60% ER so I don't know what I'm going to do? I do know I'm not taking Tamoxifen again if all these SE go within the month. Does Tamoxifen or these other drugs really help against cancer returning and if so how much.",

Nothing to worry about ( not sure what that means) anyway I go to physio every few weeks have done since my surgery. I have swelling on my scar, shoulder and neck pain. Am going this thursday so my GP says she will ask them to look at my back. I have a lovely lady everytime who has helped me so fingers crossed she can.  I'm not going into work ( work with DH own business) as I can't use the comp or lift files. I have put another hot compress on my back and moving as much as possible. Driving makes it worse so only doing that when I really have too. Will speak to the physio lady and ask her what she thinks. She knows me and my history and I'm sure she will be frank with me.  I know backs are difficult to deal with but as my GP said - if you pee or poo yourself it could be a trapped nerve. If that happen's give me a ring - well thanks for all your help doctor !!!!!",

He keeps asking me if I have insurance I keep saying yes, he then says if I can't prove it I'm taking the car to the pound. Ten mins later DH calls me so I tell the cop the details. I then ask how long it will take he says not sure. I then say ok only I'm a cancer patient and I'm going for my first rads. You should have seen his face, my insurance company had got a letter wrong on my number plate. Very late for rads and I find out rads above my collar bone - not a happly bunny.

Why is there nothing light weight and invisible? I've had terrible pain since the Nodes being removed and now this? Just when I was feeling good about myself and I was on top of my bone pain. Linda you are a star always there with comforting words, bless you. How is your garden? I'm in mine doing things and I think that's why it's got worse. My problem is I do everything at once. Cut the grass, do washing and ironing, clean the car and vacuum the house all with my bad arm as I'm left handed. I think because the last 12 months I couldn't do these things I just want to be normal again. Also my surgeon told me last week my outlook wasn't great which cheered me up no end. Ok enough !! Hope your all doing well. Is there a list of do's and don't to stop it getting worse? Having given up booze!!!",

Today they said it had increased by 15% so i need to see someone. I have been having physio on my scar tissue but nothing on my arm. It's a lot larger than my normal arm from the elbow to hand. It's not big but i have skinny arms so it does notice. I'm very upset i may have to wear a sleeve because i just don't want too. I'm too vain and i don't want people knowing i've got a problem. I just feel like everyone else why more **** to go through. I have pain in my joints all the time, blurred vision from chemo like the rest of you guys. Feeling sorry for myself i know and maybe will come to terms with this.",

Yes it can be hard and not nice but I have had two now, the first week for me is a right off then the other two weeks I'm back to normal and fine.
