While I do not regret my decision to have that, I just wish there had been better information out there on what to expect. NOTHING I have googled could have prepared me for what I have been going through these past five weeks!!! Ok, forget the tubes (also the devil) the expanders feel like bricks (the BIG kind) in my chest. I have trouble falling and staying asleep. I cried every day for 4 1/2 weeks... now I am just mad. I feel like I have been through ENOUGH already, when is my body going to give me a flippin break??? EVERYONE keeps telling me \"it will get better\" I'm getting really sick of hearing that. I want to know WHEN it will get better (yes, I know, everyone's body is different) I've had my first fill of 60cc in each breast last Friday. Shocker.... made the pain worse. Going again on Thursday for the next fill. It has been suggested to me that I take a break from the fills or request a smaller amount to be put in... won't happen, I want this over and done with yesterday. If I could get him to put in more I would. (I don't want to be very big---full B so I don't think it will take very long to fill them) I have been googling, trying everything I can get my hands on to try to ease the pain/discomfort but nothing is working. At my suggestion, my doctor give me a RX for muscle relaxers, but the only thing that has helped with (not complaining) is the spasms. (not fun) So if ANYONE has tried something that has worked, please PLEASE tell me... I don't know how I am going to get through these next months if it doesn't get any better.
