There is a Facebook group with over 400 members. Let me know how you are doing. What have they used to target the HER2",

It is hard to be so lopsided and I am avoiding using my prosthetic during radiation.",

Funny, my blood counts are all kind of low. He was willing to blame it on the radiation (I'm not sure the RO would have lol). My doctor wants me to let the blisters dry out for now so I am only putting cream on intact areas. I ran out of the carragauze the RO gave me. The good thing was my skin held up right to the end. I am glad to be able to share that I made it through and reading these posts helped",
