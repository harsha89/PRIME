Good luck, Margie",

It certainly makes me question your surgeon's knowledge of the latest and best methods. I worked for a pathologist during the 50's, 60's, and 70's and doing frozen sections was the norm. But no more. Please get a 2nd opinion from a breast center. They need to KNOW about your cancer before making such decisions and you need a complete path report. Just my 2 cents, too.",
