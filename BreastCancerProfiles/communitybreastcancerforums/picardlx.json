My mother died of breast cancer at the age of 32. My sister has repeatedly asked to get a mammogram, but her family physician does not believe an exam is necessary at this point. Both my sister and I are worried that our concerns are not being taken seriously. Are we overreacting? Log in to post a reply",

We will pursue second opinions and also look into the university cancer centers in Chicago since she lives there. I'm also going to check the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Coverage contract to see if there are any age restrictions, but if I have to I'll pay cash. This may be an dumb question and excuse me if it is: Am I (as a male) at any increased risk of cancer given my mother's early and aggressive form of breast cancer?",
