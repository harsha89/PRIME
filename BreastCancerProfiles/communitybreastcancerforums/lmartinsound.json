    "Content": "lmartinsound wrote: Trying not to panic. I just turned 25, no direct family history of breast cancer but I've had a marble sized lump for about eight months at this point. My gyno felt it as well, ordered a bilateral diagnostic mammo because she said both my breasts felt \"lumpy\" to her, I was then turned away and told they would only give me an ultrasound because of my age which came up clean. This was all back in early July. My dr left me a message requesting I come back in three months for another clinical breast exam and if necessary she would refer me to a breast surgeon.  Fast forward to today, sitting at my desk I received a call from the same radiology department that declined to do my mammogram stating they had an order from my dr sent out this morning for a diagnostic mammo. I couldn't reach her to ask what was going on but after looking at my work calendar I realized tomorrow is the only date I could possibly be seen for the next month so I just took the appointment. Then when I got home I was checking my breast and a teeny tiny bit of blood came out from one little spot on the nipple.  I'm flustered with how little drs and radiologists have been communicating with me. I understand the statistics, I know them better than most my job every day is to share information on cancer and despite the statistics of someone my age being affected being in my favor that doesn't change the fact that some ARE affected.  I'm not paranoid, I know somethings off and I would LOVE for it to be benign. Whatever the cause I just want to know and to be treated like the informed adult I am.  I know none of you can provide medical advice but anyone else who has been there that would like to share their story and insight would be greatly appreciated.  Log in to post a reply",
