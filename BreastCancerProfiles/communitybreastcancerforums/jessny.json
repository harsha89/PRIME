I think it's a very good thing you're getting the biopsy given the presence of blood in discharge. I'm afraid I don't know about the process but I'm sure someone here will be able to better advise. I've only had an ultra sound before because I'm young and also have implants. Try not to panic, sounds like you have a good doctor who's being thorough :) I'm sorry I can't offer more reassurance but you're in my prayers :))",
