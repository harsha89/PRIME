These boards were so helpful during that time. I find myself now in a situation with my sister, who had a needle biopsy of her right breast. I read the path report. 2 tumors low grade er/pr positive and her2nu 2+ (which would mean she would need next test) I was alsow her2nu positive in 1 breast.... The tumors are 1cm and 2cm... Anyways she is refusing all treatment and we as a family are trying to get her to at least have surgery to remove the lumps... We are all having a hard time accepting that this is what she wants, knowing that it is her choice really. I am sad, mad and scared and don't know how to help her. Perhaps it is the wrong thread to post this, but any incite into how we could convince her would be helpful. We have told her we will support her decision to not treat after surgery, if anything comes up. but at this point all signs are early stage and it just seems foolish. She is 60 and thinks it will all be fine till her time to go....and hates drs and hates what they do ect....... Log in to post a reply",
