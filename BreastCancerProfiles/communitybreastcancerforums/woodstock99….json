I ran around doing errands and grocery shopping and about to sit down with DH for dinner and try for the first time in months to have a relaxing evening Had dinner with good friends last night who will come and sit with my DH on Tuesday. Another dear friend's mom is a hynotherapist who gifted me with a session Monday night before I go to sleep for my SNB & BMX Tuesday. She had me write out in first person everything I think I will do from the time I get up on Tuesday until I come out of recovery (except for actual surgery). It actually was also very helpful so I don't forget anything! We will talk tonight for a brief interview and she hypnotize me by phone tomorrow night before I go to sleep. I have never done hypnosis before and am a tad skeptical but it can't hurt and if it helps me be less anxious and reduce my anxiety on Tuesday it will be great. ",

They removed 3 sentinel nodes on right & 4 on left but pathology came back clear! Will get final report next week. Was in recovery awhile and didn't get to my room until almost 8pm. Friends stayed with my husband which a very was great and I told them all to go home. First night hardly slept as they were in/out every 5 minutes it seemed.i was very nauseous and had to get meds intravenously. Also had my pain pump of dilaudid. My BP was very low also which seemed to only concern me. Yesterday a bit better. They took away the pain pump and put me on Percocet. My BS came by midday or so and told all went well and nodes were clear and that I should get catheter out with my beautiful blue and emerald pee! Got out of bed and sat in chair for about n hour and took a very small walk in the hall. Had company on and off and was embarrassed if I fell sleep while they were there. Haven't gone number 2 since Sunday but I am hungry and eating like a horse. Intermittent sleep last night as well. Woke up every few hours. Can't seem to get comfortable. I only got 2 drains and they are not bothering me yet. I was shocked to feel the drain up by my clavicle and they explained it was wrapped all around. BS said my breasts weighed a bit over 5 pounds and my left was larger than my right so incision not exactly the same. All in all, doing ok and hospital staff great. I think I will go home tomorrow. It's hard to be out of control and to ask for everything. Sorry if this is a bit incoherent. It took a long time to write. Hope everyone is doing well and hopefully will make more sense next post.

I saw the MO first but will start with BS. I sent a copy of the email exchange with the the BS nurse to the nurse navigator so when I went to see BS after MO, another one of the center's nurses took me into the exam room and my BS said I am healing very well. The area of concern that I was worried was an infection or even possibly shingles near the drain was a reaction to the tape that she had used to keep the drain in place that had gotten blistered. She removed the tape on both sides and use a non-stick pad near the drain instead. She told me the blisters may pop but not to be concerned. Based on my drain log, she said the left drain could come out today (day 8) but right one was not ready yet so she wants to wait to Monday (she only has office hours M&W) and remove them both. She told me that that she will remove them (yeah not the mean nurse), steri-strips will dissolve on their own. reviewed final post-op final path report: as expected, no surprises - clean margins, and said on Monday will give me exercises and will see me in 6 months. She did tell me to get more rest than I have been/. But when I met the MO first, I was thrilled to learn she does not feel it is necessary for me to go on AI after we discussed side effects, my fibromyalgia and quality of life concerns. She said I had a very low Very low risk of recurrence and if BS agreed that we will do surveillance and I will work on lifestyle changes - weight loss & exercise - to reduce risk. Doing a happy dance. She said I can think about this and Iif I want to try an AI, let her know and I will also see her in 6 months as well. I was there for 4 hours and had a friend over for dinner who stayed way late so I am exhausted & need to go to sleep. Thinking of you all and looking forward to drain removal on Monday     ",

I am heartened to hear of everyone doing well and sending healing thoughts physically and emotionally to those who are not. After reading the last few posts about oncotype and mammaprint I do have a question: are these tests done on all types of BC? I know neither were done for me and still not clear if I need to pursue and how to do so if my surgeon did/would not do. I can also tell you that after following up up with the MO who does not want to put me on AI that she also communicated that there is no reason for me to even see her again since she is not \"treating\" me. She said I need to lose weight, exercise and since I did not do genetic testing, have a pelvic ultrasound but I can get that done anywhere. I think she fired me for asking questions about her decision. Has anyone who has had BC and BMX not have an MO for ongoing following even if not on AI? I was pretty stunned. While I am sure my BS technically did an excellent job, I am all around disappointed with the after-care, lack of post-op help and guidelines, nasty nurse who makes errors and gets defensive when I try to get corrected (she have me prescription for 2 bras and 8 forms) and regret not opting to go with the other surgeon I was considering. I feel like I no longer have an advocate for my ongoing health and well-being but would be embarrassed trying to see the surgeon I did not choose for a post-op consult if there even is such a thing. I definitely think I am going to find another MO for a second opinion as I want to do everything possible to avoid reoccurrence. Shouldn't everyone who has had BC see a MO for regular follow up if only for surveillance? I finally took off the bra I have been wearing since surgery (I had 2 of them) and switched to an Amoena Frances bra with no filling or forms and at least I do not feel like I have a belt tied around my chest twice. I am still very sore and swollen under my arms so put cotton guaze pads under the bands. I have an appointment tomorrow with a LANA certified PT who I am going to self-pay to get an evaluation of how I am doing mobility and healing wise. Has anyone started to use any lotion or oil in the area above or below their incisions? My skin is very dry and starting to get flakey? Has anyone or when will you start to do any scar massage or use any scar strips? It's questions like this that when I asked my BS when she took my drains out this past Monday her answers were not very clear or more like whatever you want to do. Anyway part of my post got deleted when I tried to edit and fix typos but I wished everyone a good weekend and happy to be picking up Moses & Coco from boarding tomorrow afternoon after a few weeks as they are jumpers particularly the 7 month old toy poodle puppy. I forgot the rest of what I wrote earlier. I know I also said I hope we all stay in touch in the future. Thanks  ",

      "Content": "Jan 30, 2016 10:47PM - edited Jan 30, 2016 10:52PM by woodstock99 Thanks to all who responded to m post last night. I live in major city and my BS/MO are associated with a major NCI center that is also a teaching facility. I do think it is a personality or treatment style as the b=nurse navigator who communicated the MO's info t me to,d me that my BS would defer to the MO. I had even asked if the MO would speak with my internist to get a better understanding of my overall health status and she did not want to even do that. I will pursue contacting another MO even if it means I have to crawl with my tail between my legs to the BS who I did not choose who I regret and I with everything happening so fast I never got back to her so am embarrassed. I also do't think I will have issue with insurance covering a visit to another doctor as they are coded as doctor visits. For the most part today, I tried not to think about things. I did see the LANA CLT therapist this morning and she was great and put me at ease about where I am at in terms of healing, swelling, scars, incision, massage, etc. She thought I was doing grew for under 3 weeks from surgery. There is one area where the scar is hard on right side and she showed my husband how to massage it kind of perpendicular to try to loosen it up. I will see her her again at approx the 6 week mark. She told me to start using coconut or lotion below my incisions where my skin is starting to get very dry but not to start doing anything on the scars yet. The location where my right drain was removed Monday is also almost all closed and the left drain is still just slightly oozing, She suggested doing the spider arm walks in the sower and to be sure the water is warm but not too hot and even suggested turning in on cold for a second before getting out. She did tell me I still need compression to help with swelling so while I had switched out of the post-op torture bra to the Amoena Frances (but with no fills), she put cotton balls inside of it to add padding. I told her I;d rather be wearing nothing or a soft camisole but she said not yet. She also told me when I return to work on 2/8 to plan 1/2 days the first week as she said it really takes a good 6 weeks to get been close to feeling like you did pre-op. Lastly, she did suggest that even thigh I have no indication of lymphedema that because I did have 4 sentinel nodes removed on each side that I should always try to have blood drawn from my leg as well as having BP taken there as precaution. She said most places will accommodate you if you let them know in advance but if nit to always have them do on non-d0minan t side. I am right0handed so do on left side if only option, Anyway, we picked up our dogs who at first seemed like they and forgotten us and after our shocked at the close to 3 week boarding bill, had fun with them the rest of the day. The weather was beautiful and I took my first walk for a few blocks and we watched \"The Intern\" and had a low-key evening. Sadly a dear friend's niece who was only 47 passed away unexpectedly this week and the memorial service is Sunday afternoon so my first real outing will be there. I have also been staying up way too late and have to try to and get back on a better sleep schedule. So hope every one is having pleasant dreams and as good a weekend as possible.  ",

For whatever reason I am both physically & emotionally. I felt like I had overdone it last week with visitors & being on computer a lot working from home but yesterday was week 3 since surgery and I still feel awful. My chests hurts, my armpits are so sore, I can't get comfortable, nothing feels comfortable to wear (no bra, soft bra, compression bra, camisole), still swollen in a spot benind my shoulder and in the middle of my chest like look like mini-boobs, drains have been out for a week but still slightly oozing daily, if I don't take percocet/valium/neurontin3x/day I really hurt & if I do, I get very tired. I practically fell asleep on a conference call yesterday & thankfully was on mute and no one asked me anything, I am afraid to drive. I am afraid to go back to work next week. I have no idea what to wear. I don't even feel like I can carry a purse and my tote bag that I take work to/from office with me. I have started my exercises but I feel so helpless. I am short (5'5\") so hard to reach anything, Sorry for griping and I know no one here really knows. I guess maybe I need to ask some of the Nov or Dec women how long it took to feel ok. Sorry for griping but yesterday & today are bad days & I don't even know why. I went to sleep at 11, woke up at 1:30 & could not get back to sleep until almost 4, woke up at 7 and am exhausted again so going back to bed. If anyone has figured this out yet, help! Thanks.",

I decided to try to go out on my own and drive to Walmart yesterday to look for some Genie bras recommended in the non-recon forum. What an adventure. My car door is heavy so I have to be careful not to pull open too far or I can not reach to close. Backing out of our garage was a challenge. I went around 2 to avoid rush hour and driving itself was ok (no pain meds yesterday). Only had to go a few miles. Trying to pull a cart out was first hurdle. Navigating thru the store was fine & I found what I was looking for although I shall be returning today as these run small. I decided to pick up a few things we needed and was so embarrassed to have to ask a woman who worked there who is shorter than me to hand me something from an upper shelf. She looked at me like I was crazy. I felt like I was walking so slowly. All was ok until I got to my car and popped open my trunk with my key fob. Problem is fob doesn't close the trunk & I couldn't reach the button to close it & had to wait until someone pulled into a spot near me. I am just not used to asking for help & it's weird when you outwardly look ok so people kind of look at you funny. I will certainly be less judgmental seeing cars with handicap tags and people getting in or out of them that look fine. Anyway a dear friend who is a massage/aromatherapist/lymphatic drainage specialist brought us dinner last night and she had been the first person besides my husband who saw me nude after surgery the day after I got home from the hospital. She took a look at me last night and definitely saw improvement in 2+ weeks. She works with a lot of cancer patients and thought my incisions and scars look good. She is concerned about the swelling under my arms (not arm pits) but upper arms (the lower flabby parts). She does not think lymphedema but she told to try to wear a long sleeve tee shirt if I can get over my head that is tighter than usual but not tight like a lymphedema sleeve. She also told me that the \"lumpy\" thing back behind my right shoulder may be a dog ear even though my surgeon was supposed to make me flat but she said give it some time and I can deal with that later. She also told me to be sure to watch my posture, do lots of beep breathing and to try to \"push\" my chest out without moving my shoulders & to definitely start using oil or lotion on my neck and chest as I am getting very dry flaky areas. I did end up falling asleep again last night watching tv but I slept from midnight-7 so woke up feeling better today, Dread returning to WalMart but it will be my exercise today. Wishing all a good day.",

Got an ABC Leisure Bra & the light forms (not silicone) on Friday and after a few hours felt like I had 50 pound weights on my chest. Had no idea how heavy the lightest forms are until I took the bra off with forms in them. I think I will stick with the $9.98 (as seen on TV) Genie bras sold at Walmart recommended on the Going F;at forum. The pads in these weigh like nothing but of course do not even seem like an A cup but are at least comfortable. I have had to size up 2 sizes in these though. Time will need to pass before I am even close to ready for silicone forms. I think I have found a new MO - at least got a name recommended by a few people locally and will call this week. I am starting back to work tomorrow part-time and will see how I do. I am kind of scared. Had our best friends over earlier for Super Bowl but they left after half-time. Will stay in touch all.

She said they use a children's needle. This is the person who told me not to use the Emla cream - their protocol does not call for it or the lidocaine in the injections - because it affects the imaging. But I told her my BS prescribed it so she backed down. She also told me not to be upset if they do nit get any image sod nodes later. This happens based on metabolism & body functions. She said I'd get dressed and be let out to waiting area with my husband but to massage the breasts and walk around so that the injections could \"marinate\". She said they like to have 2 hours until they do the imaging so they will probably take me back at 9:30. They I will go to surgery pre-op waiting area, My surgery is at 11:30 (it was 11 - I think my BS squeezed someone in-between her 7AM and me). The tech said my BS in addition to their scan will still use a probe & the blue dye to look for the SN, Hope that helps. ",

She & I both agree that due to my anxiety and the SNB and the delay in surgery probably best for me to go old school & do standard anesthesia.

Home sick with the crud going around but otherwise doing OK I guess. Good days and not so good ones. It's sure been a process. Still seeing a PT for ROM and cording issues. Not happy with my lumpy nasty bits & dog ear left but will decide later what if anything to do about those. Not wearing prothesis yet. Too much overall chest tightness and soreness. Stocked up on $9.99 Genie bras. Freaked out on my first flight last month but opted not to wear sleeves as I have no signs yet of LE. Joined a fitness center & bought a Fitbit & determined to get 30+ pounds and my middle off of me this year. Have lost 10 pounds already. Everyone who sees me says I look great & am doing well. My scars are healing well but I'd like to find something that will make the scars less red. Anyone come across anything yet. Life is pretty much to what it was pre-op in terms of work, life, family, etc. I don't see my BS or MO until end of July & found my own PT as as I hated the one at the center where my doctors are. Just wanted to say hello!",

      "Content": "Jul 6, 2016 06:49AM - edited Jul 9, 2016 03:11PM by woodstock99 Hi Ladies - happy 6-month anniversary! Just wanted to check in and see how everyone is doing as we all hit our 6 month surgical anniversary and will all probably be going in for our check-ups. My anniversary will be next Tuesday, 7/12 & I go for my 6-month check up with BS end of the month. For me, still good days & some not so good. Overall, doing well emotionally and healing well but I am still suffering from chest wall tightness, soreness & some swelling under armpits that the summer heat & humidity seems to have intensified. I still can not bear to wear any type of prosthetics and have the \"iron bra\" feeling that I have read many women get. I am still going to PT weekly and will be seeing a lymphedema specialist next week just for a peace of mind check but he is also a PS who I want to get some input from about my \"nasty bits\" left by my BS that have not gone away as I had hoped and I am not happy with my physical outcome. I opted for no recon and am still happy with my decision but I was planning on wearing prosthetics vs going flat but until I can or does not bother me but I have a lot of excess skin under left armpit, a dog ear under right armpit and what I call \"alien\" kind of in the middle of my chest - this puffy tiny ball-like thing where my scar ends. Not really wanting to do revision surgery yet but want to know my options. I have yet to find the right thing to wear that is comfortable and right now am wearing stretchy camisoles. I was ok during the winter covering up with sweaters and scarves but it has gotten harder as the weather has changed. Some of the soreness lately may also be related to increase in exercise as I have made significant changes in diet and fitness. I am now going to gym 3-4 times a week and started swimming (with noodle or kick board) and doing treadmill in addition to recumbent bike & walking and wearing a fitbit for awareness. Thank goodness for Lands End and their tank swimsuits and rash guards so I can go to the pool and not feel uncomfortable. It's been an emotional 6 months as my 30-year nephew was diagnosed with a rare osteo sarcoma in his right thigh about 5 months ago and has been through months of chemo and will have his 12-hour surgery next week followed by 18 weeks of chemo. So please say a prayer for him. No history in our family just like no BC either. And a good friend and woman who has worked for me for many years had a mass found on her pancreas during a CT for back pain and is meeting with a surgeon today and is having upper GI scope & biopsy on Friday. So prayers for her too please. I had BMX with SNB and my therapist and most everything I have read says no needles or BP in my arms due to LE risk. When I talk to doctors though to ask about blood draw in my foot when I have to get my upcoming labs done, they tell me I have very little risk of LE and will not write order as they say blood draw from foot has more risk. Kind of drives me nuts. Life otherwise has returned to normal or new normal. Days I do not think of my BC and days it's all I can think of. Days I have profound gratitude and days of intense anxiety about recurrence. Days I love the medical system and many new connections I have made and days where the lack of continuity of care and lack of consistent info drives me nuts. Anyway, I hope everyone is doing well and thought it'd be a good time to check in as this board has been pretty quiet. Sending lots of love, peace, joy, health & happiness!           ",

Probably between meds & taking a xanax before drains came out so a bit nauseous but wanted to tell everyone with drains that the removal anticipation was far worse than the reality as I have found things. I was glad my BS did it & not Nurse Ratchett but she told me to take a deep breath and I id & it was painless & over quickly. I think DH was going to pass out. I at leafs could not really see it., It's weird now not to have that drains wrapping around my collarbone etc. BS said I would have some oozing next few days but should be ok. She also removed steer-strips but told me to wear the bra U have had since surgery for another day or two & then can go to any bra with soft fill. Interesting I noticed today that none of the exam rooms have mirrors. I was a bit disappointed as there is an area on both sides between my chest and upper arm near my armpits that I thought was just swollen but would eventually go away but BS said it will not & I asked if it could be surgically removed. She said that if it was cut that it would make it difficult to raise my arms. Maybe it will not look so bad when I have healed more & swelling is gone. Apparently this is not the dog ear issue as she took my incisions all the way around to my back since I am not doing reconstruction, She told me I can start to drive short distances later this week & I am scheduled to go back to work in 2 weeks. She also gave me booklet of exercises to start in a few days and said some pain & soreness will be better in 6-8 weeks and some will take longer. She said I could resume seeing my massage therapist for my back land lower body but to wait a month from surgery to do anything on upper front. I asked about scar strips or oils or lotions and she said my call. I do not see her again for 6 months unless I have a problem. I did speak to the MO's nurse who spoke to the MO about rethinking taking an AI. The MO conveyed that she really was not recommending for me as my recurrence risk is so low and because of my fibromyalgia (which rarely bothers me now) and other issues. While I am happy to hear this everyone here seems to say that you really need to at least try taking an AI which I was now offering to do and I am wondering why she does nit want me to even try one, I told the BS earlier that I wanted to and she thought that was a good idea. I had nothing to lose. So now I am conflicted. My BS did tell me that it is critical for me to lose weight (I am 5'5\" and weigh 175), get my BMI in check & exercise & that will go along way for me. I guess i need to get a message to BS what MO said. Anyone have any opinions about this? Thanks. Hope everyone is doing well and those in the East managing to deal with the snow, etc.",

She said I could resume seeing my massage therapist for my back land lower body but to wait a month from surgery to do anything on upper front. I asked about scar strips or oils or lotions and she said my call. I do not see her again for 6 months unless I have a problem. Is anyone else 2+ weeks out from surgery who has started t use any lotions or oils or do massage? As I mentioned last week, when I met with the the MO the first time, she was fairly neutral about me going in AI's and coupled with my concerns about SE's and having fibromyalgia and spinal stenosis,being watched for glaucoma, on high blood pressure, cholesterol & thyroid meds, said she was ok with me not going on them. I will recap that I had (summarizing from final path report) : Right Breast: intermediate & hugh nuclear grade, crib form, micropapilary & flat types associated with central necrosis, and involving the lobules and sclerosing adenosis. DCIS present in buckshot fashion in 4 slabs from 11:00 to 9:00; span about 4 cm area. Margins are negative. Lobular carcinoma in situ, classic type, The 4 sentinel lobes removed were all negative. Number of blocks with DCIS: 6. Number of blocks examined: 16. Nuclear grade: 2 & 3. All margins: > 10mm. Pathologic staging: pTis No (sn) Left Breast - Stage 1a & DCIS: Invasive ductal carcinoma. Tumor size 2 mm, Tumor site 1:00. Tumor Focality: Single focus. Histologic Grade: 1. Nottingham Score: 5, Tubular Differentiation: Score 3. Nuclear Pleomorphism: Score 1. Mitotic Rtae: Score 1. No residual invasive ductal carcinoma identified. DCIS, grade 1, 2 & mostly grade 3, cribiform, and sold types associated with central necrosis and calcifications and involving the lobules. DCIS present in buckshot fashion in 3 3 slabs from 1>00-2:00 span about 3.5 cm. Margins are negative. Extensive lobular carcinoma in situ, classic type, nuclear grade 1 and atypical lobular hyperplasia involving preexisting fibroadenoma and adenosis. Margins for invasive or in situ carcinoma: negative. All marginsL > 10mm. All 4 lymph nodes 0 metastases. Pathologic staging: pT1a N0 (sn) Comment: high grade DCIS with focal out pouching growth at the edge with inflammation noted and a feature that is suspicious for invasion, SMM and P6 immunostains were perfumed and they highlighted the presence of myoepithelial cells, There is no evidence of invasion indentified. Deeper levels are also examined. E-cadherin is negative in the LCIS. After I saw the MO and spent a few days rethinking about taking an AI particularly after reading about recurrence with a high rate of those with stage 0 and 1 cancers, I decided that maybe I should try one and at leafs see how I ddi on one so after I had drains out on Monady I spoke to the MO's nurse who spoke to the MO for me. The MO conveyed that she still was not recommending an AI for me as my recurrence risk is so low. While I am happy to hear this everyone here seems to say that you really need to at least try taking an AI which I was now offering to do and I am wondering why she does not even want me to even try one.

My BS did tell me that it is critical for me to lose weight (I am 5'5\" and weigh 175), get my BMI in check & exercise & that will go along way for me. Anyone have any opinions about this? Do I get a 2nd opinion form another MO? Overall feeling ok after 2 weeks. Weaning off win meds. Working from home doing email. Still very sore and fatigued. Will start exercises in a few days and am going to see a LANA certified PT on my own. BS does not refer. Not feeling up to driving or going out yet. Maybe by the weekend. Best to all. Thanks.",

Just wanted to say hi and see how everyone was doing. Positive check-up yesterday. All good. Doing my best to stay healthy. Keeping up with my 3x/week exercise although can't seem to lose any weight but not gaining either. My husband and I started a plant-based diet almost a month-ago and already there are noticeable improvements in sleep, skin, digestion, etc. The red meat was not hard to give up and it's been a challenge but a good one. We have a lot of food options here so has been easy and tasty to do although more challenging during travel. Still having the iron chest syndrome and too scared to do another surgery to get rid of the excess skin under my armpits, dog ears & other nasty bits as well as to try & clean up the scar tissue that might be causing this so just learning to live with it and doing massage and myofascial release treatments when I can. Have totally gotten over living flat and no longer even try that hard to disguise it except when swimming when I wear a swim shirt over bathing suit. My dear nephew who we thought had beat his osteosarcoma last year has had recurrence in both lungs and has had 2 surgeries in the past 2 months To remove the tumors. It's heartbreaking. The treatment options presented all have the same outcome none of which are very promising (20% at 5 years) so we are starting the process of 2nd/3rd opinions and perhaps will hear of something more optimistic. Hanging in as best as we can. It's been a very difficult and sad journey. Doing our best to stay positive and focused. Wishing everyone here the best and hope it's been a good 18-month anniversary for all since our 1/16 surgeries. ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüôèüå∫  (thought I posted this yesterday but apparently something went wrong)",

A friend who is a retired physician emailed me this earlier today: Being apprehensive is a normal human response. Only a robot would have no feelings pre-op. Every patient before treatment also feels \"ill-prepared physically and emotionally,\" but you just focus on one step at a time and gradually gain confidence that you can do this. Just look at the next step, and do that one step. I By all means, be your own advocate.

Thank you! __________________________________ Drain Care: You will go home with drains in place. The nurses will teach you how to care for your drains. Please record the drain output daily, and bring a log of the output to your clinic visit. How do I empty the Jackson-Pratt drain? Empty the bulb when it is half full or every 8 to 12 hours. Wash your hands with soap and water. Remove the plug from the bulb. Pour the fluid into a measuring cup. Clean the plug with an alcohol swab or a cotton ball dipped in rubbing alcohol. Squeeze the bulb flat and put the plug back in. The bulb should stay flat until it starts to fill with fluid again. Measure the amount of fluid you pour out. Write down how much fluid you empty from the JP drain and the date and time you collected it. Flush the fluid down the toilet. Wash your hands. When will my Jackson-Pratt drain be removed? The amount of fluid that you drain will decrease as your wound heals. The JP drain usually is removed when less than 30 milliliters (2 tablespoons) is collected in 24 hours. Ask your caregiver when and how your JP drain will be removed. When should I seek immediate help? Seek immediate help if your JP drain breaks or comes out or if you have cloudy yellow or brown drainage from your JP drain site, or the drainage smells bad. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Breast Surgery Discharge Instructions You have been treated for right and left breast cancer. You will have had removal of both breasts and removal of sentinel lymph nodes in each armpit. Warning signs to look for: Fever >101.5, chills, persistent nausea, vomiting, uncontrollable pain, shortness of breath, swelling, fainting, redness or drainage from your surgical incision or drain site. Activity after Surgery: You will feel fatigued for several weeks after surgery. This is normal but your strength and stamina will improve over time. You May- Participate 3-4 weeks after surgery aerobic activity such as walking inside on a treadmill or outside. We also encourage you to walk around daily. Take showers. You May Not- Do not lift more than 10 pounds for the first 6 weeks. This will allow your incisions to heal. No bathing or swimming until after your post-operative clinic appointment (approximately 4 weeks), but it is ok to take daily SHOWERS. Pain: It is not uncommon to experience some pain for several weeks after surgery. It is from the natural inflammation of the tissue, muscles and ribs. The pain can be a dull aching pain or a sharp shooting pain. You may also have some numbness, tingling or irritability to clothing. This should all resolve within several weeks after surgery. You will be given a prescription for pain. You should take every 4-6 hours as needed for pain. Try to wean off of the pain medication within a few weeks. Some patients do not require any pain medication after surgery. Medications: At the time of discharge, you can resume your normal medications. Constipation is a common problem after surgery especially if you are on pain medication. You are encouraged to take a stool softener, such as Colace daily while you are taking pain medication. You may want to add a laxative as needed such as Milk of Magnesia, Miralax, Magnesium Citrate, or Dulcolax tablets. If you still cannot have a bowel movement after a few days, please call the clinic for further advice. Please complete your course of antibiotics as directed (if ordered). Diet: After surgery, you may resume the diet you were on prior to surgery. Your appetite will slowly come back over the next several weeks. If you notice you are having multiple loose bowel movements, you may eat foods that add bulk to your stool such as white rice, pasta, bananas, cheese, tapioca or rice pudding, potatoes, bread, applesauce or yogurt. If you feel bloated or nauseated, chew your food well and eat small frequent meals. If these symptoms continue, call the clinic. If the smell of food bothers you, try eating it at room temperature. Getting enough fluids is very important, but the majority of liquids should be taken in between meals, not with meals. Examples of high caloric drinks are Ensure, Boost, some nutritious juices, Gatorade, and milk. Incision Care: There should be little to do with your incision as it heals. You should shower every day. You may have someone help you the first few days in case you get unsteady on your feet. Gently wash the incision area with soap and water but do not scrub or rub the area. There is surgical glue on top of the incision called dermabond, which will wear away over several weeks. If the incision starts to become red, swollen or open, or drain a significant amount of fluid, please call our clinic. You do not have to cover the incision unless it is draining fluid. Do not apply any lotions or creams to the incision, or the area around the incision, until after your follow-up clinic visit. Wound Care:Your wound is covered in Dermabond- this is a dissolvable skin glue that is holding your incisions together. It will dissolve on its own within a few days to one week. Do not try to peel it off - let it dissolve on its own. Your drain sites are covered with Tegaderm.You can shower and do normal activities with this on. It will likely fall off on its own in 2-3 days. Do not try to peel it off. If your wound is covered with steristrips underneath the tegaderm (as described above), leave those in place. If not, you can cover the wound with a bandaid as needed--you do not always have to have it covered. Drain Care: (Applies only if you have drains in place) Empty the drain at least twice daily into a measuring cup. Record the output and quality of drain output in a journal and bring this with you at your next follow-up appointment. Follow-up Appointment: Your appointments have been scheduled and are printed (see below) in your Discharge Report. By the time you come for your post-operative visit, you should be feeling better, having a better appetite and gaining strength and likely off of pain medication. It is expected that you will not be back to your normal routine yet but this will improve over time. We hope that your stay with us has been pleasant. It has been a pleasure for me and my team to participate in your care.",

I am asking for help in serving me - the patient - better and continue to run into obstacles that are making this a very stressful experience for me.

I understand every patient and their needs are different but I do not understand the extreme rigidness and inflexibility I have encountered ever since I made the decision to have Dr. xxx do my surgery.

He basically did my pre-surgery call today in terms of asking health questions/issues/instructions/etc and gave me his cell # if I have any more questions. He was familiar with the PNB but not so much the pectoral block. I have spinal stenosis in my neck and was worried about where you get the needle injected. He is 62 and has been doing this for years so I feel confident about him. I guess I will decide on the block after I talk to who would be doing it on Monday. I'd rather have it after I am out not before. Also was called by Nuclear Medicine who does the SNB and they do not want me to use the EMLA cream. It is not their protocol just like mixing lidocaine in is not. She says their studies (teaching hospital) have shown they they see less lymph nodes but she said since my BS prescribed it that I could use if I felt I absolutely had to. She said I will get 3 injections on each breast close to nipple. Then I am let back out to general area and to try to walk around & massage my breasts and \"marinate\". She said sometimes they do get any image son the scan - depends on metabolism & body function but that BS will use probe & dye in surgery anyway. Has anyone else been told not to use the cream?

It bothered me at first going back to work but I wear loose clothes & scarves anyway so I feel less exposed. As summer approaches I am not so sure as clothing options will need to change and I want to start water walking and swimming when I can but I am feeling and looking well overall so no complaints. I think we all heal differently. Hang in there",

Did really well yesterday and was excited to be discharged today. Had still be on IV painkillers plus Percocet Valium and Neurontin past few days. This morning they said I could have a shower and used a belt for my 2 drains and covered my dressings with some clear adhesive squares she took off after. She washed my hair and the warm water felt great. This was also the first time I saw \"me\". Not for long and pretty much what I expected and did not freak out. Wonder when that will come. The bs had warned me my incisions would not be the same as my left breast was slightly bigger than the right one. What freaked me out is this giant ugly bruise underneath my armpit on the right side and a slightly smaller one on the left. I refused to leave until they sent a doctor to look at them. She said I had a slight very tiny hematoma on the right but no oozing or pus and no fever and she was not concerned. She folded up some gauze pads to add more compression between the post surgical bra and me and said to do so every day. I did not get prescribed an antibiotic - has everyone been given one? I also was not given any exercises. I will see MO next Wednesday but am concerned having 3 SN on right and 4 on left removed. I was prescribed Percocet, valium, Neurontin and told to take Colace twice a day and a laxative tonight as I have not gone to bathroom sine Sunday. I was feeling pretty good when we left but someone in the course of a few hours got worse & different pain. Not sure if I pulled something but I have new pain in my neck and shoulder on left side and down into center of back but also feel \"hollow\" in the chest. I can't imagine how much it would hurt to cough or sneeze. Feel tighter everywhere. I brought the breathing thing home and couldn't get above 1500 tonight. I can't get comfortable in our bed and thought I could use our recliner but it's manual and I can't work the mechanisms myself. Not sure if I will need to rent a hospital bed or recliner. My husband emptied drains at 7 and right side was 50. Has not been this much since serf try. Left was 25. I was running between 20-30 in hospital on both sides. I am waiting up another hour to take meds and have alarm set for 4am. Hope I get some sleep. Sorry have lost of everyone and wishing everyone well. Thanks. üôèüôèüôè‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  ",

Today more so on right side in terms of a pulling feeling. I feel like 1000's of nerve endings are being stuck in holes of electricity and my underarm area still very sore, my neck is stiff and back hurts. Also my left hand wrist where I had IV for 4 days is sore. but otherwise good. i have color in my face and am less cold today. i am trying to skip some doses of percocet to every 6 hours are every 4 is too much. Visits by friends who have been dropping off food have been awesome as have help with washing around with toilettes and we washed my hair in kitchen sink standing up and lowering my head face forward. Dh went back to work. i had major constipation issues. by sat night i had not gone since the prior sunday. i had been taking colace before surgery & upped to 4x day after. fri night i took milk of magnesia but it did not work. i took it again on sat aft along with a cup of smooth move tea. that seemed to work although it was painful. i went 2x sat night. I drank another cup of smooth move tea sunday and am continuing the colace. night i had the runs and that continued earlier today although not as frequently or violently as it was last night. i will need to watch downtown abbey again as i must have rewound it 14 times. I am still taking Colace but took a senakot pill tonite as its supposed to be more gentle than m of m. yes for me too this is still very surreal. I still can't believe this has really happened although I see and feel it. I guess it's hard to know how i will look when the bruising/swelling is gone and so are the drains. right now a month off seems glorious and much needed but i hope in a week i am going stir crazy instead of being tired and weirded out. I left a message for a CLT Lana therapist who works very close to where I live and work today as I'd like to get ahead of therapy and exercise if I can. sorry for not being real specific about names but i am having some brain fog but am reading all the posts and thinking of everyone who is in recovery and good thoughts for all who have their surgeries and procedures coming up. xoxo  ",

      "Content": "Jan 19, 2016 03:11PM - edited Jan 19, 2016 03:21PM by woodstock99 Frustrated - So tomorrow is my one week post-op surgery (plus 1 day) follow-up visit with BS and surgeon had told me back in mid-Dec when we set surgery date and I asked about sutures, post-op care, etc that I would not need to do anything as I would come back a week later and have my dressing changed. So I sent a message to her nurse today asking: I know my dressing is being removed &/or changed tomorrow. Will anything actually hurt? I feel like everything is glued to me and may want to adjust my pain pill timing. Thanks. Nurse answered: You should have removed the dressing after 3 days. If you are waiting until you get here, it shouldn't hurt, but I don't know your pain threshold. It is up to you. I freaked out and answered back but no reply: I specifically asked Dr xxx the day I was there in December signing surgical consent about stitches, dressing, post-op care, etc & she told me I would come back a week after surgery to have dressing changed & that I did not need to do anything. Also Dr xxx saw me on the 1st & 2nd day after my surgery (Tues-Wed-Thurs) & never said I needed to remove the dressing the next day nor did any of the dr's or nurses who saw me the 4 days I was in the hospital. I had my surgery Tuesday & was not discharged until Friday afternoon. I saw a doctor and a PA the day I was discharged (day 4). I also just re-looked at the physician discharge instructions that were included with the hospital discharge paperwork & all it says in wound care section is: you have steri-strips over incision. Do not take these off. They will fall off on their own. You may shower but do not soak in bath or pool. You will need to empty your drains, record, etc. No mention of dressings. I would like to know what to expect tomorrow since there seems to have been some miscommunication issue about this and I am looking to minimize additional pain UPDATE NURSE RESPONDED: You should expect Dr. xxx to remove your bandage tomorrow. She will not remove the steri-strips or glue, whichever are present. She will review your drainage record.  So I just undid one of the bras they sent me home in and looked at myself and really don't know what to do. I know what steri-strips look like from my biopsies but none of these have fallen off. I am also not sure what else is attached to me. I have not showered since Friday when the aide at hospital showered me but she covered my front with sheets of plastic so dressing did not get wet. I have used a lot of washclothes to clean myself daily & planned to shower after doctor tomorrow. This nurse has been mean since day one and I dread having her do anything to me. I also know that my surgeon does not do the drain removal. It's done by nurse of nurse PA so I am really getting anxious about Nurse Ratchett doing anything. What do you do when the nurse is not nice? Should I try to have my husband take anything off tonight? I have gotten so much conflicting or incomplete info that my head is about to explode. Is it me or is this nurse very terse and unplesant? Any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated. Thanks.",

Luckily she is not in any physical condition to travel and I did not tell her about my surgery until the night before and told a white lie. I said I had a lump being removed & would be in the hospital a few days. I did not want to upset or worry her. My husband called her post-surgery to tell her I was ok and do you know 2 days later she called 911 to go to emergency because she was sure she was having a heart attack. She had a bad UTI which she has recurrently and is back there tonight. She has not called me once. I have to call her every day. My younger sister and I have been estranged for about 8 years as she was & still pretty much is MIA when it came to my mom & step-dad (before he passed away 3 years ago). She & her family never did anything to help physically, emotionally or financially when he got dementia at the very end and I got alone got them out of their home and into assisted living and then him to memory care and have cared for my mom all these years with my husband. I have not seen or spoken to my nice & nephew who I treated like my own for years. She & I communicate via an occasional text. I felt morally obligated to tell my sister exactly what was going on with me medically so that she and her daughter now know they have someone immediate in their family with BC. My sister sent me an awful robe in a size small. My sister knows that I probably never wore a size small in my life let alone at close to 63 and post-op so it was either a regift or purposely bought her size as she knew I'd return it as it came in a box from a store we do not have where I live and she get offended whenI mailed it back to her with a thank you note that it would be wasted on me. Everyone - hang in there! PS - went to PT assessment today & found out I have cording. How much more is there that our BS do not tell us about upfront? And from my research so little is known about this. I had to practically beg for a PT referral as my BS said most BMX patients do not need. The PT also told me what I suspected and that I will have a dog ear on my back on the right side as I adamantly told BS I was not and would never do recon so to please make me flat. I know this was not optional or elective surgery but I am really surprised by the lack of full disclosure and aftercare by BS. Maybe it's just the one I got or the facility I chose but if I do not advocate for me, I'd be in bigger trouble.    ",

It's been a wild ride since bad mammogram late October. 4 biopsies. 1st/2nd/3rd opinions with surgeons & 3 consults with plastic surgeons at 3 different hospitals. Have decided to forego reconstruction for a variety of reasons that my husband and I are completely comfortable with and believe the right path for me. Right breast - 2 areas of DCIS. One is grade 2-3 solid w/comedo necrosis & calcifications. One is grade 1-2, solid and cribriform w/cancerization of lobules. Left breast - 2 areas. 1 invasive ductal cancer w/lobular features, grade 1A less than 2mm & DCIS, grade 1 to 2, solid and cribriform w/cancerization of lobules. ER & PR Positive. Her2 Negative. Told growth rate is 5%. Having my SNB a few hours before surgery as I did not want to do day before. Was told based on what they know now no chemo or rads but yes to aromatase inhibitor and see medical oncologist on 1.20 when I go back for post-op check. Freaked about the drains. Was doing ok until I got surgery date. Now more anxious & in countdown mode. Doing a lot of prep though through all the wonderful suggestions on this site and friends who have had surgery before - have my shrine of surgery & post surgery items building up in spare bedroom. Have been fitted for post-surgical camisole with drain pockets, etc. I know as the date approaches I will get more frightened. Having pre-op tests (labs, EKG & maybe chest X-ray) & meet with anesthetiology next Tuesday, 12/29. I am not so afraid of the destination but of the path to get to wellness. Have an amazing husband, great friends and supportive boss & coworkers. I feel surrounded by light and spirit and power that comes from all f ten and many strangers on this site. A very Merry Christmas to many of you and wishing all the joys of the holiday season. Will keep checking in to see how everyone is doing. \"And once the storm is over, you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive.

Is there one brand that might have a wider wiggle room in size so I don't need two different sizes just because my right wrist falls over by 1/4 inch. She says she didn't think the cool ones come in 15-20 size just fairly standard solid colors. I will look on the websites as they have to order as they don't stock 15-20 size. I also have my measurements from week before and one and almost two months since surgery. Perplexed still though about these",

I did have my arms measured pre-op for baseline and quite a few times in past 2+ months and no change. My BS did not steer me in either direction but her office faxed prescription for me. I have developed cording since my surgery and am seeing a PT where my BS is as well as a private therapist who is doing lymphatic drainage/massage. I ran into my 2nd choice BS last week and she said not needed for short flight. When I went to the boutique to order my glove stye fitter there said to get Juzo but in 15-20 compression but said only sleeves no gloves or gauntlet needed. My private therapist told me to wear them a couple of hours a day before my flight to get used to them like breaking in a new pair of shoes. So yesterday I put them them on as I was leaving for work and after about an hour I started feeling nauseous and lightheaded. I left them on a bit longer but then took them off. The therapist is away teaching a class and I called the boutique to ask if anyone has every had that type of SE and they told me no. I swear I was feeling fine before I put them on. Anyone ever have or hear of this type of reaction? Could it be a reaction to the rubbery band at the top? I am thinking of taking them with me but not wearing and doing all the other in-flight suggestions and I do have a few questions/ I have read to wear loose, comfortable clothing. Easy but what about bra? I am not doing recon and best I can manage to wear without too much discomfort are the genie bras, At night I wear a man's white cotton Hanes t-shirt. What is best for in flight? Also would it help or hurt to wear compression socks o no relationship? Thanks in advance, 1/12/16 BMX. Stage 1/DCIS. Log in to post a reply",

I have been going to the gym since march and doing treadmill and some machines and the Power Plate (and swam during the summer some) but my body is telling me it misses the yoga. Most of the restorative or classes for me are during the week during the day but I work FT. I found one that is given on Sunday afternoon starting today that I may try. The owner told me at first this was a restorative class but then later said it is stretch class but to talk to the teacher before and let her know about any restrictions. Do you think this description sounds too challenging & if not, what should I tell the teacher? I am still having extreme tightness across the chest and into my armpits. I have a lot of excess skin under my left armpit and a dog ear on the rights die where my incisions end. They are not symmetrical. \"Looking to maximize your athletic performance? Yoga for Athletes integrates movement, strength, balance and breath to help athletes excel, no matter what the sport. Movements specifically geared toward opening limited mobility areas like shoulders, hamstrings, and IT bands, will allow you to gain flexibility and ultimately move quicker and more safely during competition. We'll test your limited mobility areas before class and then work them throughout the hour. You'll see a huge improvement after just one class. You'll also learn to edge out competition with breath. A mindful breath practice is important for athletes to oxygenate during hard workouts and to keep calm and focused before and during competitions. If you're an athlete or just a tight body, this slow, deep stretch class is perfect for you!\" Thanks.",
