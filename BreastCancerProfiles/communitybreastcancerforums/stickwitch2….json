I can't get a lumpectomy because my tumor is considered large for my breast size and near the nipple, so it was really out for me. I even came to research about cryosurgery in the US and in China but still out. So its just mastectomy for me. I didnt want to take the FISH test but I was told it was really needed for me to get a comprehensive treatment. Good luck on your surgery on the 15th, I will be praying for you.",

I was 100 % happy. After college came and surfing became my favorite sport, I used to get my top always losing its battle with the combined powers of pounding waves and sunblock that I was beginning to think, 'ok, happy with my boobs 95% of the time.' When I had my diagnosis, I cried for weeks that I was going to lose my right boobs, the side my cat loves to use as a pillow when he needs a warmer one than his own and no more v-neck tops and baby doll dresses and tiny bikinis. But hey, losing one boob is better than losing a life, bluntly said by someone I know who doesn't really know what I am going through. My kind sister and her friend was so great to skip a day at the office to give me a photoshoot at a nearby island 2 days before my MX. They say for posterities sake....Here is the page of my pictures: thresca.tumblr.com/page/2. I remember when they wheeled me in surgery that all the nurses where males and only females were the anesthesiologist and the surgeon. No worries. We were three scheduled for MX that day. My surgeon told me when the next day that the team was shocked because my boobs were 'beautiful and perfect'....well, on the outside.... After the surgery, I realized I can now wear bandeau tops instead of teeny bikinis....my cat has now moved to the left boob since I had to spank his claws and paws sinking on my tender surgical scars on the right. I am now enjoying bouson tops and knitted dresses that dont hint if I am uniboob or boob+foob....Life goes on...",

That's great:) Read as much as you can and list the questions you would want to ask your doctor. GraciousGal has outlined some of possible diagnostic and procedures you may undergo. If you are not comfortable with the surgeon,go to another. Check their experience and their credentials, too. The surgeon should be able to answer all your questions and provide you with additional information you may need in order to make a sound decision and put you at ease with the procedure. They usually know plastics surgeo whom they have worked with and may recommend you for further consult should you go for reconstruction. Goodluck and take care:)",
