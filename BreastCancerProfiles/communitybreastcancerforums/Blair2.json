Shaineswife and Erikag, and anyone else here with children- my heart is with you both having to go through this with such young kids. You could all be my babies as my daughter is 39 (didn\u2019t want children sad to say). Motherhood is a full time job - even with one child. I hope you have nearby relatives that can help you with the kids. Maybe older kids will pitch in helping mommy by keeping their younger brothers and sisters entertained. It will be a challenge, but I hope your bad days are short. Friends with kids could help take care of them on the really tired days too. The neighborhood I lived in many years ago had a \u201cmother\u2019s day out\u201d deal where you would volunteer play hours, keeping track of balancing the hours between each other. It was nice in that you could have time for yourself with some peace and quiet. With a cancer situation- they should just volunteer some care for you hopefully.",

Unfortunately, my daughter didn\u2019t want kids, and all I have for a grandchild is one spoiled cat! She and her hubby do not live here, so I hardly ever see them. We do talk at least once a week.

However, I have a fear of being stuck upstairs, so sick I can\u2019t get downstairs. I have a fear of being short of breath (mind you I have heart disease), and it\u2019s just ridiculous how my mind is thinking about it every hour. I have not relaxed over any of this since I was diagnosed - period. I had all these great plans for Fall, and none of them have been done. I sometimes feel my family doesn\u2019t care enough to be with me, but they live in other states. I can\u2019t afford taxies, not sure about Ubber existing here, and besides, I don\u2019t want to be sick in a stranger\u2019s car. It goes on and on. I fear my doctors aren\u2019t paying enough attention, or care how I might react. I feel like a guinea pig most of the time when I go to Drs. appointments anymore. No port and I bruise terribly. Have they even noticed? I\u2019ve read a lot of posts here, and I have come to the conclusion that most do feel like they have the flu for 3-4 days, a lot of just pooped out, no energy to function for most part, loss of taste, and diarrhea is high on the list of ailments. Imodium seems popular for that headache. Nobody likes the feeling of flu, but we can live through it. Some who have to take neulasta because of low white cells, get bone pain, so Claritin has been popular to take care of that. Overall, I have read only one person throwing up, just once (may not of taken her nausea pills fast enough, or ate too much), and everyone has lived through their chemo that has had it. Regardless of chemo cocktails, the side affects are the same. Quite a few have said it\u2019s not as bad as they expected, but everyone has reacted to it in different ways. I keep telling myself I can live with fatigue- plan to sleep and watch movies. Nausea should be controlled by the meds, and those bad days will seem like an eternity, but I think I can do this. However, if it\u2019s were to be terrible- I can say forget it, I\u2019ll take the risk. (But do we really want to?). Keep telling yourself it\u2019s mind over body.

I\u2019m definitely going to chew on ice and try to walk - unless I\u2019m too dizzy or queasy. One question- do they administer the Benadryl at each treatment, or are you taking it prior on your own? Is it to relax you? It seems all these drugs they give you, and recommendations for OTC drugs for side effects is overkill for the body. How do you take so many in the 16 hrs. you\u2019re awake? None interfere with each other? I\u2019ll never be able to remember to ask a doctor so many questions that are on my mind. I have statins and blood thinners on top of all these drugs. And a thyroid pill Rljess - if your doctor hasn\u2019t done so, ask for an anti-anxiety drug like lorazepam. It\u2019s also an anti-nausea drug. I told my OM at my first visit that my stress level was a 10, and so she prescribed that along with the base anti nausea pills prochlorper. I tried taking one lorazepam the other day and one at night. It seemed to calm me down some. I felt a little sleepy after I took it during the day, but I was testing it out. (Okayed by nurse to do this). It didn\u2019t cost much. Anyway - call your Dr. and ask if you could take it prior to your treatment, or at least have it if your anxiety is too much later. ",

People with early stages may need chemo or not. When the Oncotype test is a higher number, over 18, but between 30, it's in the so called gray area of needing chemo. Over 30 is considered high risk, so that's why many of us early stagers, low risk clinicals, end up needing chemo with or without lymph node involvement. When cancer cells invade the nodes, then it's most likely a doctor is going to recommend chemo, because it could mean the cancer cells are sneaking into your body when they reach the nodes. Also understand the Oncotype test analyzes the genes that make the persons cancer likely to reoccur. Don\u2019t cry - your nodes will be fine and after chemo, those nasty cancer cells should be gone or killed. With all treatments, we all have a slight risk of recurrence. Until cancer is truly cured, then we need not worry. Keep in mind that medical science has come a long way with BC, and is almost cured. We are so lucky we don\u2019t live in the 1950s! We would all be dying! Keep your chin up, try not to get down (Oh i should talk, with my past worrying), listen to your doctor, ask a lot of questions, and you\u2019ll be fine.

I never had back problems before, unless I just pulled a muscle, but that would go away. This isn\u2019t going away. Leave it to me to get some weirdo side effect Rljes- my head is exactly like yours now. However, I look like Dr. Evil, you look good!It\u2019s pretty scary to see myself in this guy!

I\u2019m to ice it 3 x a day for only 20 minutes. I was doing 30 mins. 4 times a day and sometimes applying heat. The chiropractor said to skip the heat. If I strained or sprained my muscles, it could take several weeks. Ugh- I have to be able to face down by radiation time or I\u2019m doomed. I asked if I should do any kind of exercises, but he said not now. I don\u2019t know what to think, but I\u2019m really frustrated dealing with this.

Plus I'm having company this Friday with a young couple who has a 4 year old boy - just hope he doesn't have a cold or anything. Actually he's my daughters friend's little boy and I'm quite anxious to see him. So I may be clobbered with all kinds of germs as kids touch all kinds of things. I don't know how we avoid people anyway, and you have to do errands. I get cabin fever, and besides, my car will die if I don't drive it after sitting unused for days at a time. We do have some bad flus going around here. It's risky all right. My second round caused me to lose my taste. Nothing tastes good. My first round didn't effect my taste. My nose runs every time I do eat. That's strange. I also had more stomach cramping off and on. I hope our third round doesn't make it worse. I'm going crazy enough, so don't feel alone.

However, I ask for no sympathy, and I think half my friends are confused at how I muster through, but again I\u2019m use to being independent. I do mostly miss my daughter and wish she lived closer by. However, do I worry? Yes I do when I don\u2019t understand why my body does something I don\u2019t like.then it angers me a bit - like my back pain. So it helps to vent on this site, but I also get a bit frustrated with doctor\u2019s replies. Do I fear my extent of life with the two worst woman diseases? Not really, but I wonder all the time how many years I have to live, because I want to do this project or that project before I die, and I ask myself will I have enough time to accomplish them? I hope I have at least ten years. Do I wish someone would be in my house while I suffer on my sick days? Yes, sort of. I wish someone would cook for me. Even having a pet to cuddle would make me feel better - but that\u2019s just me missing my little Tahnee Doxie. But then, sometimes when all I want to do is sleep, I\u2019m thankful I have the peace and quiet in the house, no disturbances. Even people texting me on my awful fluish days, bugs me a bit because I\u2019m too sick to want to answer them - but it\u2019s their kindness, so I just write one line answers hoping they understand I don\u2019t feel like texting. The only time I would want a person with me, is if I feel I can\u2019t breathe, but chemo has not made me feel that way - thank God. Do I wonder if I\u2019ll ever be the same again? Yes, I wonder how hard this treatment along with radiation is going to make me feel after it\u2019s all over. I want my energy back, my sanity, and I don\u2019t want to see another doctor/clinic ever (but we know that\u2019s not happening). I want this to go away! I want to feel normal. When this is all over I want to go on a trip somewhere far away from here and just breath again! I want to to look over a high mountain top and see the sky and land go on forever! That\u2019s how I phychologically feel. Cancer, heart disease - get out of my life - but then I realize, oh, they\u2019re here to stay, but I\u2019m going to pretend they are gone and that I will go on living or else!",

Last night, I woke up at 2 am with my back getting worse. I was hoping I could skip 24 hrs of Aleve, but took one anyway, because it is too annoying to have my back cramp, or lock to a point i can\u2019t move but in very slow motion just to change a position of sleep. This side effect is the worst compared to the dry nose and itchy scalp. At the same time last night, I slapped a combination of coconut oil, plain healing lotion, and anti-itch lotion onto my head as it began to itch really bad. I don\u2019t like the smell of all this junk.p on my head. I\u2019ve noticed the burly brissels are falling out more. Maybe eventually I will have a baby butt smooth head? Oh, who knows, but today I think I\u2019ll try rubbing some hydrocortisone cream into the red itchy areas. Paulette- how is the radiation going? Did they recommend good creams for it? A humidifier would be good for the dry air. I had one years ago, but it broke down. There\u2019s not a lot of use for a humidifier in FL. I used it for my daughter when she was little. I used a nose strip to help me breathe better last night. The Aleve and dry air is most likely the cause to the bleeding culprit, so that\u2019s another reason I cut back on the Aleve. When I\u2019m asleep, my nose clogs up with the irritated blood tissue - which then causes me to blow the bloody gory in the morning so much. Kivans - I didn\u2019t get an ear pain, but the TMJ magically disappeared yesterday as quickly as it came the day before. I\u2019m glad it went away. That was a complete mystery. I\u2019m glad to hear someone else had that happen - but not glad it happened to anyone if you get my drift. Orangedaisy - Have you had your third treatment? You are also in the taxotere and Cytoxan combination chain gang. How are your side effects with 3? These drugs are full of dirty surprises. Heaven help us",

(Roaches hate rain and cold, so it\u2019s not unusual for them to appear every so often in the house in FL - I dokeep a clean house). Anyway I kept hearing this faint tapping sound like a roach munching on something. At 4, it sounded closer to my head, jumped out of bed again, but found nothing. Spent 15 minutes looking all around my bed, shook the headboard - looked under everything, I did not want a bug on my bald head! I then sprayed some Raid behind the headboard. Sound stopped, but never found a dead roach, and the smell of Raid made me get out of bed early and now with lack of sleep, I\u2019ll be really worthless today. I shouldn\u2019t of sprayed that Raid - hate the smell - poisoning myself twice here. Ridiculous.",

She said that bone cancer travels through the lymph nodes, not bloodstream. Since I had no lymph node invasion, she ruled that out. The weird thing with this back pain is that it goes away, but returns 5-6 days after chemo. I know it's the chemo drugs causing it. By next week, I should be ok again, but this isn't the reason I'm considering skipping my last treatment. Although it's been hard to find topics on what happens if you short the total treatments, I did find I'm not alone. Many have done this with doctors permission. Mostly doctors have okayed it for gray area Oncotype patients. I know if my cancer had invaded through lymph nodes I would carry on. Don't get me wrong, I'm still considering it, but as I said before, I'm not worried about a 2% increase in recurrence. At least I got through the most important ones. I'm still waiting on my last two questions from my my OM about the actual recurrence. I have two weeks to make up my mind - I didn't think I would get this sick on my 3rd treatment. I truly believe my body is getting harmed by more than just fatigue and back pain. No telling what it's doing to my heart",

One time shouldn't hurt. I also think because of my age, that my body is not recooperating as fast as it should, and may need more time inbetween treatments. Not sure if that is plausible. I was still exhausted prior to treatment 3. My lab results have been good, so I think they think my body is just ready to go. As soon as my back feels better, I've got to take walks. The weather should warm up here soon. I'll get this figured out and try to strengthen myself as well as psych myself to this last treatment.

Nausea wasn\u2019t my problem, I just couldn\u2019t eat, and what little I could force down tasted horrible. I was so weak, just couldn\u2019t eat anything. The mandarins were the most tolerable, but I wasn\u2019t eating enough. I felt that all was in my stomach were pills. Water tasted like bad well water with rust in it. Can\u2019t describe it. By last Thursday, I was eating normally again. It hasn\u2019t made me feel much better, but it is what it is. My nose still bleeds and runs. My eyes feel irritated too. My back got real stiff and stabbing last night. So still bugging me. Ended up sleeping partly reclined. I\u2019m still wiped out energy wise, have not gone anywhere. However this morning I took Tylenol, and no stabbing going on, but sore. This is doing the exact same thing that it did after the other treatments (5-6 days After treatment, acts up), then fades away until I get zapped with chemo again. I am exhausted and look horrible. We haven\u2019t heard from Rljes in a while. I hope she is ok as well as anyone else going through their hard days. I hope the steroid suggestionwill give me more energy to eat if I go through this hell one more time.

Hope99 - it does seem there are too many recurrences from early stage cancers. The statistics say we early stagers shouldn\u2019t have but a 10% recurrence rate on average. However, you hear a lot on these blogs of people who end up with metastatic cancers who had early stage. Those who have escaped it, aren\u2019t likely to be on these blogs, because they aren\u2019t going through any treatment. It is a scare, but it boils down to 10 out of every 100 people will have it return. If you think of total population - that\u2019s a lot of people. But on the other hand, there\u2019s the 90% people who do not have it return. I guess we have to look at it as pure fate, and just hope our bodies can survive as long as we can. I try to realize that everyone in this world has a threat of all kinds of cancers, so no one is inevitable to this disease. Just be glad we didn\u2019t come down with BC in the 1950s or 60s! Treatments have come a long way. It has added a lot of years of life. Nonahope - have you had any side effects to your toxel treatment? Do you find it harder this second time around than when you were on Taxotere or Cytoxan? You never seem to get sick - which is great you can be so strong! I\u2019m still nervous about my 4th treatment, so tired of feeling sick and tired. I\u2019m definitely sick of not being able to move with this back pain. The drugs are helping, but I think just masking, and not curing ",

I too find myself constantly worrying over the fact chemo causes side effects to our blood, muscles, organs and bones in such individual ways. Again, the lack of research on these effects make it a total scare for all of us. In the case of my back - I ask - what is it doing to my muscles to lock them up so bad? Is it permanently damaging anything? I think in ways we are just guinea pigs! I\u2019m trying to clean a little to prepare for next week. So pushing myself to move. I feel I got to get through this last treatment, and I hope the steroids give me more strength to get through the awful flu days. As far as my back pain, it\u2019s still there, but I can now sleep on my sides and back without the backstabbing pain attacks. The muscles still twitch sometimes, but the pills have dulled it a bit. The chemo drugs are winning this battle of torture I\u2019m afraid! Taking my cleaning very slow, in fact, I\u2019m icing my back now. My primary said to stretch the muscles some, so I have been doing different positions. (Very slowly) Can\u2019t tell if it helps, but being sedentary isn\u2019t good either.

Her doctor started her on Tamoxifen, but it gave her more side effects. My sister had a hyperplasia mass in her early 50s. The only reason her doctor put her on hormone therapy was because she thought her hyperplasia was too close to being invasive, (she sort of disagreed with radiologist), so it was a precautionary thing. She has been clean 15 years later. Rljes - I too noticed my age spots became darker all over my skin. Some appeared out if no where too. So you\u2019re not alone on that. Hope your neuropathy fades away. I think, but not positive, that my back might be getting better, but until I run out of pain pills (one more left), I\u2019ll know for sure. It still pulls a little in a dull way. Still have a few muscle relaxers left and a new prescription waiting at Walmart. I see my radiation oncologist next Tuesday. That should be interesting.

Anyone have this happening with low grade fever on and off? I don\u2019t think I would have any infections. This has been going on since treatment 3. OM was not concerned unless it went up to 100.4. My ankles didn\u2019t swell as bad tonight, but I really wish I would pep up. I can\u2019t understand why my last treatment hit me so hard. I sleep like a rock, so I get plenty of rest, but absolutely no energy during the day. Last night my back tried to bug me as I changed positions, but I\u2019m trying to ignore it.

It\u2019s a smaller machine compared to the big TrueBeam machine. You sit in a chair with your breast smashed horizontally like when having a mammogram between clear plates. They install these D-shaped, or round shaped applicators that guide the radiation beams through them. A physicist hooks these tiny tubes to the applicators from the radiation source (looks like a robot). It lasts about 5 minutes, then they smash you vertically and treat you again. It takes about 25 minutes. It doesn\u2019t hurt and I have had no irritation from it at all. (I had 8 treatments) The applicators are above and below you in the horizontal position, then are left and right of your breast in the vertical position. Here\u2019s a link about it. I was told my Accuboost treatments were more concentrated in the tumor cavity,and that the TrueBeam radiates the whole breast. ",

The only scary thing to me was the fact in the breast tissue they took out (I had a reduction in both breasts), during surgery, they found a hyperplasia mass in the opposite breast. No one ever told me if it was one of the MRI\u2019s findings. Hyperplasia is the most bottom Stage 0 condition, but nevertheless, made me cringe hearing about it. In your case if they recommend a mastectomy, it\u2019s so that you won\u2019t have a local recurrence since there are more than one tumor. It would improve your prognosis then.

Nonahope- are the drugs not helping that neuropathy? Tuesday I\u2019m having kyphopkasty done by a doctor who is not at my regular clinic. The one there had horrible reviews, so I had to research another outside my usual clinic. This is a procedure that puts cement into the disc. I saw my mri images and it is pretty much flat, and severe was on the written report. I was lucky in that the injury still has fluid in it to be able to have this done. He\u2019s suppose to be good and I had a heck of a time finding one that does this procedure under my network. However, his clinic isn\u2019t well organized as I was there for three hours just to be seen. Too many patients and I ended up being the last one to leave last Monday with a new admin kid that didn\u2019t know what he was doing. It was a little nerving. This will be an outpatient ordeal, but I hope it\u2019s not painful. Wednesday I have a total bone scan - why - it\u2019s for future reference. The bills will add up. Yes - in addition to being mad at my primary, the clinic (not the spine clinic), but my main clinic sent me a gigantic bill that has three mistakes on it, so I have the wonderful pleasure of disputing that tomorrow - if I can get through to someone probably having to hold for an hour on the phone listening to horrible music. I\u2019m sure you know how that goes. I\u2019ll probably get some nasty person in billing. My daughter did get here safe and sound with the horrible grand kitty. However, she flew back to Austin Friday and I\u2019m to pick her up this coming Thursday (provided I can drive). They say you can do normal activity after the procedure- but I\u2019ll be in a back brace. She went back to help hubby with house and packing for a few days. She starts work next Monday. The hubby was also here after flying his little plane to a hanger in near by town. He flew back Friday too -commercially. . He has to stay with house until sold. Daughter will stay with me as she starts her new job. The cat is a fiesty thing that jumps up on everything, eats the patio plants, and I have scolded her several times. I\u2019m alpha kitty, but she just doesn\u2019t get it. This was not my idea of a grandchild! Anyway, this was a busy week and that\u2019s why I haven\u2019t been checking in. Training a spoiled kitty, icing my dang back every hour, and going in crazy circles keeping up with kids on the move. My friend will take me Tuesday to the procedure.

It\u2019s going to look like a chia pet - oh my. I never had such tight curls! Kivans - I hope you are right about the back pain. It hurts when I put make up on. When I sit back a few minutes, then the pain goes away. I guess my being slightly slumped irritates it. I can stand longer without it hurting, but if I bend over too many times, it bugs me again. It feels like the same pain I\u2019ve had forever - that\u2019s what concerns me. Maybe it will take a long time, but articles on kyphoplasty usually say there\u2019s an immediate relief of pain right after. The surgery is not very invasive. I had no stitching on my back. I had bandaids that I finally removed. However, that procedure was more painful than I thought it would be. Oh - after they told me last week that my mammo was ok, I get this follow up letter today telling me that they saw what they believe is a benign mass on my right breast, but they will follow up in 6 months on it. Really? (In other words, they don\u2019t know what they see). I was told I was clean after my surgery - how could anything new grow that quick going through chemo? Did the breast surgeon miss something? I thought the new3-D technology on mammograms made detection more accurate and easy to detect. They should have just cut everything off so I wouldn\u2019t have to be humiliated with questionable mammos the rest of my life! So sick of this! Sorry, in a bad mood realizing how much science lacks.",

HER positive is harder to treat, and I think that alone makes the recurrence rate a little higher. This disease definitely sucks! We all carry a risk of future possible recurrence regardless of our individual variables. I\u2019ve seen some people at this site who had pre-cancerous conditions, and later had a more advanced cancer develope in their breasts. Some early stagers have had a recurrence of metastatic cancer occur after 7 years (having all previous treatments).Metastatic is bone, liver, brain or lung cancers. Those are the biggest fears that we carry from having breast cancer. Again, we have to not let it drive us crazy and hope for no return. Many have avoided a recurrence for over 25 years. Just stay positive and try not to worry-it\u2019s all in God\u2019s hands what happens to us.",

Orangedaisy - my hair is doing the same thing, so curly, but I\u2019m still too embarrassed to be out in public with this hair.

I do wear it around the house and neighbors have seen it this way, but still wear my wig most of the time out shopping. Sorry you had such an ordeal with cellulitis - antibiotics can be brutal. I react the same way to them. My back has improved, but there are days I wear my back brace to cope with pain. It\u2019s off and on. I\u2019m so frustrated with it still.

It's definitely a step by step process that seems like an eternity of waiting and we can't help but worry. About all you can do is start counting the blessings. For example when I had my biopsy - they were looking at two questionable spots, but one was only cancerous. Then after the MRI, three spots had to be sonogrammed again, but they were all ok. So I counted my blessings of only having one tumor - although not a blessing in itself. It could have been worse. Keep your chin up - we can get through this.",

The good news is - your bodies are strong and can get through this! Today I talked to my oncologist and she suggests a 4 round treatment of Taxol & Cytoxan every 3 weeks, or 12 week total period. Temporarily scheduled for Nov. 21st. Just in time for Thanksgiving and Christmas-ohwheeeeee! I have to think about this - my Grade went up from 2 to 3 after examining tumor post surgery. Oncotype was 27. Ki67 - high at 60%. So she said I had an aggressive cancer meaning it grows fast, but caught early. I think I could manage 4 treatments, but it still scares me how it might effect my future health. The percentage of reoccurrence is 18% without chemo, but with radiation and hormone therapy. That's a 1 in 5 chance of it reoccurring within 5-15 years or more. (If I live that long) With chemo, 1 in 10 chance reducing it 50% down to 8-10% percent chance of reoccurrence. Again, I'm 68, with heart disease - hard decision to make for me at this age. I'll still lose my hair and who knows what other side affects I'll have, so going to give it a deep thought to make up my mind. She is using the better drugs for heart condition. I can't use the \"mycin\" type Chemo drugs for heart. So, I have a lot to think about this weekend on this! I hope the best for all of us to get through it. ",

I got home about an hour ago and all I've noticed is that I'm a little lightheaded. I had no headaches or funny tastes. I was very comfortable. My infusion took about 3 hours. First they gave me Taxotere and bumped it up 50% intervals. Then Cytoxan was given last hour. They warned it could cause a headache and if it did, just let them know. I was fine. My lab work was excellent. My doctor said to take my Zofran 30 minutes before I eat tonight. I'll probably take my lorazepam before bed and possibly get up during night and take a compazine. I'll most likely waste a lot of these pills, but as I said before, don't trust these drugs and I don't like being nauseated. I wasn't too thrilled that I have one of those Neulasta injectors that go off in 27 hours, but I didn't want to go back tomorrow for a shot. (On north side of town) I don't think this drug is good for my heart, but I'm stuck with it now. I iced my feet and hands for a while prior and during treatment, and after - whether that prevents neuropathy- time will tell. I wasn't told to do this - just did it as a preventative. My doctor claims I shouldn't have very bad side effects. I hope she's right, but I plan to keep you posted each day. I have a lab scheduled exactly a week to check blood cell counts. Now I will attempt to eat! Ate fine,and no bruising with the IV - and I\u2019m on blood thinners, so that was good.",

She took it like it was no big deal when she did get sick and I thought - what kid would wish this? How does she do this and not get upset? I was so opposite when I was young, I cried after I got sick to my stomach and hated it ever since. She never seemed to mind it, but a part of me thought she was absolutely nuts! So many of us hate it. I\u2019m glad she can throw up with ease, but it is a horrible feeling. She\u2019s now a medical RRT - probably doesn\u2019t bother her to be around people nauseated. Well, this isnt going to take your bad symptoms away or make you much feel better, but thought I\u2019d give you my daughter\u2019s approach when she was 8 or 9 back when. (Little older than you now). I hope you\u2019re doctor can get it under control. Just wanted you to try to cope with it and hang in there. You are stronger than you think! You will beat this! Yes - rest as much as you can too. You need to ",

She ex rayed my front teeth. Roots looked ok, but there's a slight chance that trauma to this area could make the teeth die in future, but hopefully not. Time will tell on this. She only sanded my tooth. She felt the tooth didn't need filling. The filling above it was still intact, but she said the next time I needed it filled, she would extend the filling down to the chipped corner. So I got out of there for $20! Thank goodness. I just hope they stay alive! One thing I did learn before I left this morning. I called my oncologist\u2019s nurse to ask her if taking the amoxicillin prior to my dental appointment was ok. (Because I\u2019m a heart patient, this is a requirement by some dentists to avoid bacteria going to the heart as they clean or work in your teeth). She said yes, the drugs were ok to take, but if I needed extensive work done that I would be required to have blood work done first. I told her I hoped she would only need to sand my tooth, but I would keep that in mind. So I was very lucky. Other than the small threat of the teeth dying, I\u2019m good for now. Whew - was dreading this dental outcome. Seems most of here are in our good days - hope everyone is doing good today",

Rljes - that hat on you is so cute! If you cut your hair by scissors alone - you did a good job. I couldn't manage my own hair like that. It would look all chopped up and in different lenghths. Margari - My skin is very dry too. Cold weather makes it worse. That is a sweet photo of your dog - just want to hug him! Mom4gma3 - I can understand how it's so hard to let go of your long hair. I'm sure you must think of the length of time it will take to grow back, and even with my short chin length hair - that bothers me thinking about it, but it will grow back. It will just take patience - I know - our patience is about run out with this whole dang mess. I'm probably not making you feel much better, just know you're not alone on this. You'll still be gorgeous regardless what stage your hair is in! Mkn86 - You look fab bald! You younger girls definitely have a plus side when it comes to losing hair. Cute nose on your dog too! Toni/Faith - Welcome here - looks like you have the same treatment as mine. Frozentoes - That was a cute story about the kids checking your baldness. It would have made me feel better, because if it were to freak them out - they would have just said so! So you have been officially accepted into the world of baldness!

Meowmmy65 - hope you're hanging in there and beginning to feel better 19501952 - sorry your anti-nausea pills didn't work. The reflux problem is common I think for a lot of people. Hope you can get these problems under control Well - my hair is falling out by barely touching it now. This is Day 15 for me. Yesterday it seemed to be coming off the back, but this morning it comes out all over. My appointment is this afternoon- goodbye hair. I will hate myself bald - I don't think I could bare a photo of me that way - I'd scare you all away from here for sure! My back seems to be better in the morning and as the day progresses, it really starts to bother me. This is not a typical side effect, so I'm calling my doctor today about the ongoing pain. I think the muscles are contracting and I feel as if I need to be pulled from head to toe outwards. I tried stretching, but it's as if my torsel doesn't want to stretch. ",

Didn\u2019t have diarrhea, but it went away after I tried to go. I took my last muscle relaxer pill and a Zofran tablet when I went to bed. I was on Netflix looking at the programs and saw one of my favorite English shows called Miss Fisher\u2019s Murder Mysteries that I watched on our local tv arts station in the past. Rljes- just another suggestion. I love Miss Fisher\u2019s costumes and soft under the tongue humor. Takes place in 1920s. Watched an episode while the neighbors next door that have the star lights blinking through my window, had a group of people in very good spirit singing to oldie goldies very loud under their backyard rotunda, so I couldn\u2019t fall asleep. Eventually they toned down, but I slept maybe an hour and woke up to returning stomach cramps at 1:3. This time I had to go, again part diarrhea, but my cramps kept up. I didn\u2019t want to take Imodium, but instead gobbled a tablespoon of pepto bismo. That worked, but didn\u2019t fall asleep right away. Now I\u2019m up at 6:00 not feeling sleepy, but probably will later. I was surprised I would have stomach cramps so soon. The weird thing was my back wasn\u2019t bothering me as much after I got home. I can tell, even this morning, that the pain is still there, but no spasms like the last two weeks in bed as I moved. Maybe my OM put something antiflammatory in my cocktail, or a steroid. As far as I know they give me just an injection of anti nausea and then the two chemo drugs. Now that the muscle relaxers are gone I will try ibuprofen 3 times a day. So, I\u2019m drinking coffee and icing back - Coffee might upset the system, but I plan to eat and drink normally today with extra water. Not planning to go anywhere except possibly a short walk - provided my tummy behaves itself. Looking forward to hearing your reports - hoping good ones, but I think it helps to add the bad ones so everyone gets an idea what these drugs do to our bodies.",

Even though my treatments are three weeks apart, I\u2019m out of commission that first whole week. There\u2019s the two days I call \u201cflu days\u201d, in which all I can do is sleep, feel like crap, no appetite, no taste, groggy and weak, but the rest of the week is stomach cramping, semi diarrhea or constipation and there would be no way I could work through feeling this bad. I can\u2019t even trust or know what my body will do that first week. I\u2019m so sorry your sister now has to deal with her diagnosis, but good she caught it early. By second week, I\u2019m well enough to get out some, but still very tired. I\u2019m older than a lot of you, so I figure my body wears out faster than most. Nevertheless, it still isn\u2019t a joy ride for any of us. Meanwhile, to add to my venting a new side effect popped up yesterday. TMJ - my jaw was popping every time I chewed. I thought WTH - this TMJ is not a problem I ever had before - to this extent. It\u2019s just on my left side. It doesn\u2019t hurt, but feels like my jaw is out of line to pop like that. (What\u2019s going to happen next - teeth fall out?) Hopefully it will go away. The other thing that is driving me nuts is my bloody nose. I constantly blow it and it bleeds. I can blame the cold, dry weather, and the Aleve that I\u2019m trying to be careful withon that. 19501952 - Snowflake is adorable in his winter attire. I never heard of purple gators before. The things they have for pups these days. So neat - I want to get a new pet so bad. Maybe after my treatments are over, I\u2019ll look for a new baby, but like Frozentoes, I\u2019ll want to get away from here first on a trip.",

I try my best to keep up with everyone here - so many of us! Thanks for all good wishes. The cold weather isn\u2019t helping at all. Yesterday I was totally worthless.

The back pain is still there, but as long as I can move without it snagging at me, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m going grocery shopping today, so it will test my back pain. I might take a pill before I go. Standing too long gets to my back just like sleeping in same position too long. Oh Magari - the hydrocortisone cream seems to knock out the scalp itching for a few hours. I don\u2019t think it smells as bad as the coconut oil does, andmy head is less red this morning. It\u2019s itching a little this morning, but not as bad. The Mayo clinic said one could use hydrocortisone cream (preferably prescription) for it, so if it keeps up, I\u2019ll ask OM for a stronger cream. Thanks for that link.",

It\u2019s perplexing as others like her according to her reviews. I did find one complaint- so maybe she just picks a victim to be obnoxious to once in a while. She never took me seriously.

(Fine with me as I needed more time to buy a ton of things in preparation). Loading my frig with pop cycles and all kinds of silly things. The only downfall is I talk with the doctor the same day of chemo. I have a ton of questions. So I will be the last one treated this month, but will join or continue with you all wonderful ladies, and the December group as we all look forward to our different treatments and outcomes. I will not be getting a port as it is not necessary using my drugs (so the nurse told me) - taxotere and Cytoxan. Not sure if that\u2019s good or not. It will eliminate an extra stick, but I may end up with a very sore bruised up arm. It\u2019s already bruised from being on blood thinners. I picked up my anti nausea pills, prochlorper, and anti anxiety pills called lorazepam. I\u2019m going to take one of the lorazepams tomorrow and see if it calms me down. The nurse said I could do this. Won\u2019t waste the anti-nausea pills though of course until chemo time. I just want to see if it makes me feel different. I\u2019m hoping young shaneswife is feeling better by now. Stage2ire- sounds like you have your symptoms in total control.

I\u2019m so sorry you lost your mother in the middle of this mess. Life can be so challenging. Hope99 - did they figure out your bleeding problem? You have really had some problems. Hopefully it was just your period. Mkn86 - I\u2019ve read you can be reconstructed at any time after a mastectomy. (Doesn\u2019t have to be immediate). You have plenty of time to think about it. I\u2019ve seen some excellent results in photos, and you really get a perfect boob job in the end. If you don\u2019t want anything artificial (like implants), consider the flap reconstruction as it uses your own skin. I had a friend who ended up using that method after her body rejected implants, but that doesn\u2019t mean it would happen to you. It\u2019s a personal choice. Just keep reading and asking questions. Ok - back to snoozing or barely existing in my easy chair - this is enough to make me want to skip my last treatment. I think my body is telling me it can\u2019t take this anymore.

I finally got an answer, to my steroid question, but not my recurrence rate. My recurrence rate was18% without any chemo. With chemo it would bring that down to 10% with the 4 treatments. So I was thinking each treatment would average two percentages down so that with 3, it would be down to 12%. The answer was that my OM doesn't know. Isn't there any formula to why they think 4 treatments bring it down to 10%? Apparently not. There is a big lack of research - which is very scary to me. How do they come up with these recurrence formulas, and yet there are no adjustments figured out if a treatment is missed. She also doesn't recommend stretching out healing time, only if wbc's are low. So all I found out was that I'll be given steroids with pills. The nurse said that my treatment was a preventative treatment and not one that is trying to kill cancer cells in my body. What? I don't get this????? I thought I had cancer cells in my bloodstream. If chemo drugs are kept in your system forever - how can these accomplished treatments not be somewhat in my body? This is frustrating. Maybe it takes the full amount of poison to be strong enough to fight future cancer cells. (?) So, her last remark was to talk to my Dr. on my day of treatment to make up my mind. Feb. 2nd. I saw my plastic surgeon this morning and the lumpectomy reduction to my breasts is healing well. I asked about my pointy boob, and he said it could be corrected after radiation. I may see him before or right after, so no appointments were made. There's too much skin above my left nipple that had the tumor. If you pinch it, it's perfectly matched to my other boob, but at my age, not sure if I care at this point in time. It's not terrible, but it's so minor that I can't understand why they didn't notice it during surgery. I feel and look like a beat up alien! My identity is so torn up and I hardly trust the medical society's confidence in an ",

Laughed at kitty stories as I grew up with cats, had my Sadie for 18 years, and my doxie who passed away a year ago (although a dog), - wish I had them to snuggle with during this crazy time. I was looking for a pet this summer, but got busy - now this mess. :( I called my cancer center and here\u2019s what they said for my first treatment getting the Taxotere and Cytoxan. Please be aware that this is according to just my case - may not be the same for others taking the same chemo drugs. It might help to list some of this for others though, so here goes: 1. No, you don\u2019t need to bring ice as they provide it. She sounded like I wouldn\u2019t have neuropathy problems. She said that these drugs will make my wbc and rbc go down, but not as low as what the other drugs cause for that condition to be a problem. So, should be one less headache. 2. Yes, I can take all my vitamin supplements (fish oil, multi-vitamins, calcium, and Co-q-10.) along with other heart drugs - the statin and blood thinner. 3. I can take the anti-nausea pills overlapping them at 4 hrs apart between Zofran and competzine, but anti nausea drugs will be in the treatment. So she recommended I wait at least 24hrs. or until nauseated. She also warned me that Zofran wouldn\u2019t make me as sleepy as the other anti nausea pill - competzine (which is actually prochlorper on my bottle - a generic I guess). So I will take the Zofran during day and the other at night. I also have a bottle of lorazepam, but she said to judge my anxiety taking it not with the others, because it too is for nausea. (So confusing). So in other words - enny mynie mo. 4. For big D. Ok to take probiotics and Imodium, but again wait and see what your system does. 5. For constipation, no - you don\u2019t have to take Miralax brand - any brand will be fine. (This was kind of a stupid question, but they throw out these brands sometimes like you need to take that brand). 6. Bring a lunch Thursday and relax - ha! I think I\u2019m prepared. Will mix my soda and salt solutions tomorrow and take a big breath",

I regret I couldn\u2019t do it, but I was also very afraid of going through it. I went there yesterday with ice pack in toll as I had in all other treatments thinking I had to do this. I\u2019m still shocked my doctor advised not doing it, although if I had really wanted to, she would have let me do it. That\u2019s what made it hard. My friend Nancy who went with me even asked her if I had been her mother, would she advise her to go through it, and she said no. It came down to the realization that my heart risks were probably worse than the cancer risk, but we all knew - there\u2019s no way of predicting the future outcome. It\u2019s a scary thing. I\u2019m angry at the fact when I had my bypass three years ago, it changed my lifestyle through the realization that I had to live better and that I needed to change my eating and exercising habits. I was only 18lbs. over present weight, cholesterol at 153 at time of bypass. No high blood pressure, unless nervous. I never smoked. I was tested by my cardiologist who thought it was odd that I had no signs of heart disease, and results were I had hereditary heart disease, which is not a circumstance I can control, but I still had to change habits to protect myself better. Eating too much fat all my life surely contributed. I gave up eating bacon, butter, all fried foods, fast foods - unless a salad, red meat, sausage, pork, sour cream, ice cream, all cookies, (still ate a piece of birthday cake and pie once in a while), watched intake of mayo, bought all reduced fat items, cut down on eggs and cheese. I do still eat chocolate from time to time, but sugar is my worst thing to control, although I use stevia in coffee and drinks. I started reading labels for control of sodium and fat in all my processed foods. I increased intake of vegetables and fruit and even paid attention to how I prepared my meals. The blandness of taste was something I forced myself to live with, and thought I was doing a good job. Not perfect, but good. (Who is perfect?) My cholesterol was great and so thought things were under control. I\u2019m angry that I also exercised an extra 6hrs a week and took walks, and always busted my butt doing yard work and handyman jobs around my home. I was never physically idle anyways. I had a proper BMI weight. I was feeling good this past year about myself. THEN - Out of the blue came breast cancer! WHY? - when I worked so hard to ween off the bad, changed the diet, and exercised. WHY? I actually poo poo the articles now that stress one to eat and exercise like it\u2019s a great preventative. I look at that as BS. I won\u2019t change or ever go back to past habits, (I don\u2019t know, sometimes I wonder if I should!) but it makes me angry that my body has done this to me. It\u2019s like my mind and body are no longer connected and I\u2019m just plain angry. Ok - enough of this. Orangedaisy - you just have to get better from now on. Be proud you got through the chemo and each day keep telling yourself it will get better from this point on. SDK8 - I will continue to eat and exercise as much as I can. Will look into holistic ways, any great sites that you know of? Maybe a book about it would be best to find. Nonahope, Magari, Kivans, LizabethM - thank you so much for understanding me. I will be here supporting everyone that\u2019s going through this awful time. My next appointment is March 2nd for a follow up, lab, and scheduling of radiation treatments. I also found out that my hormone therapy drug will be Letrozole or Femara after radiation. (Just don\u2019t give me back pain - pleaseeeese!)",

My counts were all normal last Thursday when I had my lab. The neulasta made my wbc go way above average. I don\u2019t know if that means they will give me less or what in my next round. I never had any funny tastes in my mouth and food tasted pretty good unless I didn\u2019t have an appetite. Hope you can carry on with the youngsters. Now my back has been bothering me mostly in the morning and then it works itself out as I get moving. Not sure if it\u2019s related to chemo or not. The lack of exercising is not helping me at all. LizabethM- hope I\u2019ll feel like you after my 2nd round. Everyone is different, but it\u2019s interesting to hear how we are getting familiar side effects. I too love the dog photos. I only had a little harry beast - not so hairy dachshund that I lost last year. She was a little wash and wear dog. She thought she was as big as all the bigger dogs and did a great job keeping Diesel (neighbors black lab) at bay. She and their boxer got along, but not the lab. It was quite comical to watch them fuss between the fence. They would then settle down and sniff at each other, but it was like they had this daily argument between them that never stopped. The boxer would sometimes casually walk between them and then the argument stopped. It was asif she were saying - \u201cshut up!\u201d",

This journey is such a drag for many of us, but I do try to look at myself as being more fortunate in many ways. I\u2019m a worrier all right. I found out that I\u2019m having a PET scan and not a cat scan. Here\u2019s the difference: One of the main differences between PET scans and other imaging tests like computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is that the PET scan reveals the cellular level metabolic changes occurring in an organ or tissue. When I asked if it was a contrasting scan, the RO nurse said there wasn\u2019t any difference as a type of cat scan with one being contrasting. She then said I was having a pet scan instead. It\u2019s all confusing to me. I guess they are checking my muscles and organs. It does see tumors of the back. I don\u2019t have as much pain when sitting, but as the day goes on, it gets worse. If I stand too long, I have to sit down to relieve the pain. At night, I can sleep fine with my knees up or in fetal position, but if I move to change a sleeping position, it hurts a little. I don\u2019t know what to think. I don\u2019t even know for sure if this is bone or muscle pain, but I was getting spasms for a time when I was going through chemo. So thought that meant muscle pain Well - life goes on in crazy ways. I was sent home with a preparation list - more medical costs to face. Ugh! When will it ever end?",

Neuropathy has got to be very annoying to put up with! I\u2019m just now receiving medical bills from last October for the lymphangiography - that blue dye procedure they do prior to surgery. I can hardly wait for chemo and radiation bills. I pay $45 every time I see a doctor, except my RO is included in the radiation costs. I have no idea what that will be - not cheap I\u2019m sure. About two weeks ago I got the tail end bill of my surgery, and ER bill for my busted lip. Ugh! $88 here, $78 there and so on. Rljes - Tina, thanks for thinking of my upcoming PET scan. I just learned I get an IV of some radioactive substance in my body. How much radiation can I take? I have had some ankle swelling, lost a few more lashes and I see tiny eyebrow hairs coming in, and my head hair is almost 1/4 \u201c long in the back but so thin and bald at the top of my head. I think I\u2019ll have darker grey at top, but all white around the bottom. It\u2019s real fine white hair. Ug. I just can\u2019t believe it. Star - that\u2019s great you have finished your chemo! I still cringe thinking how awful I felt on such a short treatment I had. The weakness it causes is too overwhelming. My body can\u2019t tolerate it. Now this back issue - which just like Rljes and her awful hip pain has got to be caused by the chemo. The oncologists just don\u2019t want to accept these types of side effects. I never had back pain before chemo. I\u2019ve suffered muscle soreness in my back from doing too much yard work from time to time, but it always went away in a day. This pain has been with me since Dec. 8. I did nothing that could have hurt it physically. I was too sick and sedentary. The fall I had did not include my back as I fell forward, but I did jerk my head pretty hard - so it would be I think a bizarre reason for my whole back to hurt from the way I fell. My spine was ok, but the pet scan should show some kind of irritation. My radiation is going fine. Getting a tiny bit pinker, but no pain, so far. 24 finished out of 35. ",

The tapping thing he used did absolutely nothing as far as relieving pain. The pain is on both sides of the lower back - which does seem like the muscles and ligaments are the culprit. They twitch sometimes too. The question is - could there be tumors in the muscles of the back? Even though my BC wasn\u2019t metastatic, could some cancer cells from my bloodstream start a back cancer? Or is the chemo drugs irritating those muscles? Now I\u2019m worried, because no blog topic has anyone suffering from a stabbing type back pain during treatments. My back felt perfectly fine before treatment. Again, I\u2019m going to ask the oncologist to check with an X-ray or scan to my back. This just makes no sense. I\u2019m going to stock up on groceries today - in pain, and deal with this tomorrow.

It was interesting to me to read your reactions to drugs as I\u2019m on exact same ones.. My IV in my arm has been fine so far. No bruising at all. They even had done the lab poke in the same vein. I have a prominent vein in my right arm that makes it easy for nurses to draw blood or give whatever there. I think that\u2019s the difference. It sits up prominently even when my arm is relaxed. Also, and this is sort of a question for all you girls here - why do some of you receive steroids? They have never given me steroids, but I wonder if that\u2019s why I had such awful back pain. I will definitely ask my OM next time. Maybe it has to do with my being a heart patient? I know it\u2019s an anti inflammatory drug, so why not me? Hummmmm. I hope this back pain does not flare up in the next two weeks. It\u2019s much better now, but I can still feel a tinge of pain. This is my last day for ibuprofen doses. If it returns - I\u2019ll be upset. As far as constipation and diarrhea, I\u2019ve managed not to take any laxative or Imodium this time. I did take a tablespoon of pepto bismo when I had a crampy stomach on Day 3. I have moved much better, but it was sometimes semi diarrhea, or semi constipation as if my body was confused. However, the way I look at it is- just keep moving, I\u2019ll be fine. Like many of you, my stubble brizzley head is driving me a bit crazy. I don\u2019t care to baby butt it because I\u2019m too ugly to go bald, and a bit of a chicken to be seen as such. Just too old. My chin droops - I call it my squirrel pouch. If I didn\u2019t have that, I\u2019d look much younger, but was born with a very round face. Even Dr. Evil looks better than I. Anyway, I just wear the scarves and hats around the house. I wore one fancy cap to the chiropractor last week, but wigs make me feel more normal when out in public, (helps hide the squirrel pouch), then no one will feel sorry for me. That too would get on my nerves. My friends have been great with me as far as how they approach my condition. I think when I busted my lip, they all had to tell me, don\u2019t go down the stairs, bring your drugs up in a bag, keep your phone by your bed...bla, bla bla. They know I\u2019m very independent and stubborn. However, I haven\u2019t gotten a lot of sympathy - they are there\u2019s when I need them, which is great, I love them all. When you live alone, friends are so valuable and a blessing to have. I can\u2019t tell if my hair is growing or still falling out. It\u2019s going to be a burger when it starts to grow out again at all different lengths. My brows and lashes are still intact - thank goodness. Also I too have noticed my sunspots are more noticeable on my skin. One magically appeared on my chest that I\u2019m not thrilled about, but I thought how could chemo drugs cause that? On the other hand, my complexion has seemed to improve, which is strange, but my skin overall is bone dry. Trying to moisturize religiously. However, the worst skin effect are my blood thinners - they cause long term bruising and that just sucks. Well this is Day 6, and I think I finally feel normal again. Just hope my body functions well and food tastes good again.",

It\u2019s great you can work again without the constant interruptions of misery. I finished my last radiation treatment yesterday, and I received a call about my MRI results from my radiation nurse. She said besides the compression fracture, the other lit up areas on my pet scan (at the L1 disc), showed I had hemoangiomas tumors. The nurse said they are benign and common, but don\u2019t be surprised if your oncologist recommends a biopsy. Well, that nerved me a bit, but today I got a call from my oncologist nurse who told me that my oncologist reviewed the results on both scans and determined I would not need a biopsy for further investigation. This was great to hear. However, she wanted to set up an appointment with a pain management doctor. There\u2019s only one they use at the clinic, and he isn\u2019t liked very well, so I\u2019m leery to see him. Especially if he injects cement into my spine! Some reviews said they had more pain than when before they saw him! I had to spend my afternoon searching for other doctors that treat compression fractures. Still not sure who to see, but I see her Thursday and will learn in more detail what might happen. My disc is 70% fractured! No wonder I\u2019ve been in such bad pain. I hope I can find a doctor that can fix it. Maybe I can finally crawl out of the rabbit hole, but my issues carry on. My daughter is on her way here with thegrand cat in toll. She drove from Austin to Covington. LA to spend the night with her aunt, will spend a day with her, then will head here to Lakeland by Thursday. The poor cat will be so traumatized! ",

Does the herceptin and perjeta make you feel as bad as that awful taxotere? I wish they could make better chemo drugs! Radiation is nothing compared to chemo. Star - hope your recovery gets better soon. I can imagine the pain you must feel after that surgery. Anesthesia makes me feel like I can\u2019t breathe or take a breath. Can\u2019t explain it, but it\u2019s a scary insecure feeling. Getting over surgery is definitely a day by day ordeal. Just think of the new formation you\u2019ll have in the end. I\u2019ve seen some great results from reconstruction, but it\u2019s got to be a step by step slow process. Hang in there! I spent half the day cleaning, but my back started to nag at me, so then I did research on more local spine doctors. I think I found a good one with great reviews, so I\u2019ll tell my oncologist tomorrow that I want to see a different doctor than the one she wants to refer me to. (I didn\u2019t like the poor reviews he had, so don\u2019t want to take any chances). This one I found is in a spine institute that includes pain management as well as non- invasive treatments. The doctor is an Orthopaedic surgeon with great reviews, but not an aggressive type. Super educated. I think he would have more knowledge than that other doctor. Trained in several techniques. The place has physical therapists and everything and it\u2019s in my Medicare network which makes it nice too. It took me a long time to find this place since so many doctors don\u2019t do all types of treatments. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll qualify for kyphoplasty as my injury is probably too old, but he can do this.Can\u2019t take pain medication because of heart, so I\u2019m in a catch 22 situation.

Is there a possibility of your treatments being stretched out to three weeks apart? Do they have to be every other week?

Meanwhile the whimp here continues: I slept over 8 hrs. this morning. I never do that. The Claritin I took yesterday didn\u2019t do anything, but as Orangedaisy said, it may need to build up in system. I truly think this back pain is pure tight muscle pain - inflammation. The nurse told me that the steroids would be given at treatment time, then I would have to take the pills afterwards. She said they don\u2019t start them prior - if in fact it\u2019s the chemo drugs causing this pain. (I still think it is because of the pattern of days and the intense of pain in which it bugs me). Then she said, if the steroids didn\u2019t work that I would have to see my primary and have him figure out what\u2019s wrong. I have researched plenty of articles where patients have had back issues with chemo. It\u2019s rare, but it seems doctors refuse to think chemo has any effect on your back! So, I guess I have to remain frustrated and ignored on this. I don\u2019t need more medical bills right now with doctors not knowing what\u2019s causing the inflammation. So, my plan is, if my back is better next week, then I will continue the last treatment with the steroids. Even though I dread how I will feel with my exhaustion. The steroids may work, may not. If my back doesn\u2019t improve next week, I may skip last treatment, get my back checked (if it still bothers me) and just not worry about the recurrence rate as it\u2019s not horrible to begin with at my age. My back could be getting permanently damaged for all I know. The cancer center acts like my complaining is no big deal, but chemo can cause some people permanent damage. (I don\u2019t mean to scare anyone) Also -I\u2019m still so exhausted after two weeks. That\u2019s why I think my body is telling me to stop. I think my side effects may be worse on my body than the benefits. Maybe that\u2019s why my OM is not trying to change my mind.

I had another bad achey night with my back, when it was suppose to getting better by the end of second week - at least in the past, but this seemed worse. I thought this morning - this is the last straw - I need pain relief and somebody has got to help me. So, I called my primary and fortunately he got me in today. Now get this, he says that chemo drugs could cause any inflammation, and therefore a side effect. (Now why is the cancer center acting like this never happens?) Although, he didn\u2019t seem absolutely positive that was it. He said a lot of his cancer patients had back pain in some cases. He asked me to point out the areas of pain, he poked my spine and asked if it hurt and I said no, but when he poked the sides - yes it hurt. I even explained the fall I had busting my lip, and the pain pattern in days. I asked if possibly my kidneys were acting up, so he said without other symptoms related to kidneys that it wasn\u2019t likely it. However, he assigned a urine test and X-rays to rule out any damage to bones or kidneys. The cancer center always said my kidneys in the blood labs were good. So I had 4 back X-rays. In addition, he prescribed Meloxicam for pain, and Tizanidine for a muscle relaxer. Just what I need - more pills! I won\u2019t know the test results until Monday. Thank you girls for your input and concern - I get more attention from all of you, and I do appreciate you\u2019re listening to my whines and woes. I so admire how you girls are sailing through this well for the most part. I think Rljes has had a rough time too, and a few others",

Look at your surgery as getting rid of that tumor once and for all! That will make you feel better knowing it's not there. Your youth will heal you better/faster than us oldie goldies here. Yes, it's scary that your body will be different, but the breasts can be reconstructed to look very normal. Tell yourself it's only temporary. Ask your plastic surgeon to show you photos of reconstruction results. I know so much time is involved with your particular situation, and psychologically it wears you down, but try to stay positive. You're still and will always be a beautiful girl, and I know this time is very scary for you. Good grief - look how much I've whined onhere - and I'm old! Don't blame yourself for how you ate, or any other habits that you may have had. There's no iron clad research proving this or that directly causes breast cancer. It's only suggested by ambiguous research in a lot of cases. My big change in diet and exercise three years ago did not prevent my BC, so it means nothing in the cause. That's why I have an angry side to a lot that's preached to us. Again, there's not enough research, but we have to march on and deal with it the best we know how and trust our doctors.",

I have found I can tolerate mandarins really well during those fluish days, or any day your taste buds are off. I had my simulation process with radiation yesterday. It was quite a process. They positioned me face down similar to the MRI. They put tape markers and Xed them with a black marker all over my body including my lower back. Called out numbers to each other. I guess this was for body positioning, and rolled me into the donut shaped simulator that threw these red beams on me. It circled a couple of times and then rolled me out of it as they marked me again. Then they tattooed dots. That kind of stung, but tolerable. I think 4-5 of them. I was quite ticklish in the middle of my back as they marked me and I started laughing. I was a horrible patient, as I couldn\u2019t help but be tickled. Plus with back pain, was not good. Last night as I was getting ready for bed, here were 4 taped Xes on my back that they said nothing about. (If they did, I forgot and thought I would only have the tattoos). I almost peeled them off thinking they forgot to take them off, but I called this morning and they said to leave them alone. Whew! I hope they stay on as I don\u2019t start radiation until the 26th! Icing my back - took an Advil, but isn\u2019t much help. It\u2019s just a constant pain. Still have pesky cough, but don\u2019t feel sick with it. Coming from chest, not nose",

Finished my first week of radiation. It was kind of uneventful. After I had that hidden suture taken out Monday, Tuesday it took the techs several minutes to position me. My gown was in the way so I said, \u201clet\u2019s tear this thing off!\u201d So off it went as it kept getting stuck under me as I was to slant a bit sideways into my prone position. They put a wedge under me that helped. Wednesday and Thursday\u2019s treatment went much faster. All I can say is that the TrueBeam external machine reminds me of a dinosaur with a flat round head and long neck. It creeps under you slowly and circles around to my side (my head is slanted so I can watch this thing move), then stops to shoot a beam that I imagine is the closest one to my chest. Kind of scary as I don\u2019t trust it much. However - you don\u2019t feel a thing, just hear noises. They play music in the background - I think catered to your age. Music I listened to back in my college days! Today I had the external done and my first look at the Accuboost machine. It only took a couple of X-rays. It smashes you just like a mammo, but not as hard. I guess the doctor will calculate what that machine needs to do next week as I\u2019ll have both techniques done for a week and a half, then it\u2019s just externals my last few weeks. I\u2019m going by my monthly schedule they gave to me. I still wish I knew how these beams were hitting me. No breast irritation yet. I also saw my chemo oncologist. I complained to her that I still had my backache. She still does not accept the idea that the chemo drugs caused my pain. She more or less said that I would have to see another doctor for that problem. I reminded her that this pain had a pattern with each of my treatments, but she said she never had a patient complain of back pain before. I said you do now. Hum, there\u2019s blogs of people who have had back pain with chemo treatment. If these drugs cause muscle pain, - why not in the back muscles? It may be rare, but I\u2019m not changing my mind about it. She is a very young doctor, but I find it strange she has never read of back ache side effects. That\u2019s the only thing that has really disappointed me. I never had back problems before I started these drugs, and I didn\u2019t do anything to cause my muscles to be so messed up - other than chemo. It would always cause me severe pain 6 days after each treatment- just for some reason the pain stayed after my third one. Anyway, glad most of you are finishing up the worst. I don\u2019t think radiation will be near as difficult as chemo. Sunburn pain won\u2019t be fun, but I\u2019m hoping the fatigue isn\u2019t as bad as chemo was. Thanks on the photo - it\u2019s my new old lady greywig hat. Thought I better get use to grey as my natural hair will become this, but probably not as silver. I still show no signs of head hair, but my leg hair and nails are growing again.",

I\u2019m sure you can relate to this. Anyway, I talked again to my RO nurse, who is so nice. She said that pet scans most of the time can detect cancer tissue, but in my case the images were unclear except where they found the compression fracture that is causing my pain. That alone can take months to heal. The area below it needed to be looked at closer to absolutely rule cancer out. She even said that my fall probably caused all of this, but there\u2019s always the possibility of it being cancer. She also said that they want to dissect those areas with the MRI images so they know how to treat it. So, now maybe I won\u2019t worry too much. If I had had the back pain prior to my fall, then this would be a huge concern. We also discussed that when I fell, I was \u201cout of it\u201d and could have slammed myself onto my back, not feeling immediate pain. I do remember my mouth and face hurting the most as I literally bit through my lower lip. By the day after, the chemo drugs were kicking in, with the following days of taking pain pills. She also mentioned that I had steroid drugs in my system that could have masked the back pain until 6 days later. My son in law, (who\u2019s a flight nurse), also said that the fall could have partly fractured my disc and days later fractured more from everyday movement that caused the stabbing pain to start after 6 days (which I haven\u2019t had since). So - I will learn next week. Talking to everyone made me relax more about it. Got my blood test out of the way. That\u2019s just preparation for the MRI. With all this radiation going through my body,I\u2019m beginning to look like this! I definitely felt like this green thing looks when I had chemo! ",

Hope all are doing fine and as good as we can expect. So nice to hear you can exercise Iris - I have one more week of wearing the back brace, then I\u2019ll try mild exercises. My back doctor told me I could have this back pain for a year. Great. It is slowly improving - I think. Unfortunately Hope, once a person has breast cancer, it is an on going threat as we end up with a percentage of recurrence whether it\u2019s a local one, or a metastatic reoccurrence. For example, I have a 13% recurrence rate. Some who were triple negative may have a higher rate, and some who never needed chemo, a much lower rate. So it just depends, and doctors can\u2019t make a promise to you that it may never return. I try to look at it this way - every living person on earth has a risk of some kind of cancer. So this remission part of our cancer is sort of putting us back to where we started. One out of 8, one out of 10 and so on. You just have to hope you stay in the 80% area of no return. Breast cancer isn\u2019t 100% cured yet, because cancer hasn\u2019t been cured.Some articles are so misleading by using the word cured. I started my Tamoxifen pills for a week and a half now and I\u2019m already having vertigo. Not thrilled about that, but will give it more time. If it continues, I\u2019ll switch to something else.

How many infusions are left to do? I had mild vertigo all day, so I called my OM and she suggested I quit taking the tamoxifen over the weekend and then call them Monday and let them know how I\u2019m feeling. I hope this side effect isn\u2019t on going, but I really want to be taking Arimidex, or something different other than tamoxifen. It\u2019s worst side effect is clogging of veins! I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best for a heart disease person such as I. Not sure why she wanted me to be on it - had to do with my osteoporosis and osteopenia.

As long as they are positive - that\u2019s all good is all I know. There\u2019s a lot in the clinical details that I really don\u2019t understand. Nonahope - sure wish the neuropathy would ease up on you. It\u2019s got to be hard to have to grab on to the furniture just to get around. I now have a fear of falling knowing my back is fragile. Never thought I could collapse my back that easily- when I didn\u2019t even think my fall had anything to do with my back pain. I think it was initially cracked and collapsed days later after my fall. Anyway, I have to be extra careful with myself too getting around or doing things. I grab my stair rails tightly as I go up and down. I need to get back to my weekly exercises too. Getting old along with breast cancer is so depressing, but we got to go forward the best we know.

I was tired the first week, but it didn\u2019t effect me much after that. I itched and turned more brown than red, but now my skin looks really normal in color.

I hope the increase with the Gabapentin helps you out and hope they can give you a good plan with PT. So many of you have suffered so much. I feel pretty good now that my back has improved some. Today was my first day without the back brace. I shopped at Big Lots for a while and felt it start to nag at me, but I can tell it\u2019s not as bad as it used to be. Once I sit down a while, all pain goes away, but this will probably act like this for a while. The spinal doctor told me I could have pain up to a year. My OM told me last Friday to stop taking the Tamoxifen over the weekend. Sure enough, the vertigo went away. So she switched me to Letrozole- the drug she originally wanted me to use. Since Monday, no vertigo yet, so I hope this one will work. I didn\u2019t really want to take tamoxifen anyway because of it possibly causing vein clots. My heart arteries were replaced with leg veins! With heart disease, that makes me nervous. Tamoxifen issuppose to be less harmful to ones bones, but since I\u2019m now on Foximax, it shouldn\u2019t matter. I started Foximax Sunday, so not sure how well I\u2019ll react to it.

My ER and PR were also 90 - 95%. My tumor was smaller than yours, and I had no lymph node invasion. It makes the recurrence a little worse with an invaded lymph node as that means those cancer cells have traveled to your organs faster than it would just through bloodstream. My initial recurrence rate was 18% WITHOUT chemo. With chemo, it was to go down to 8-10%. However, I did not do my 4th treatment. When asked about the recurrence rate with the one less treatment, my OM could not tell me what it was except that the three treatments would bring it down less than 18%. So I figure I must be around 13% recurrence, but nobody knows. I can only guess your recurrence rate is a little higher because of the lymph node invasion. You still have 80% chance of no recurrence - so don't worry like it's bound to happen. We are ALL in the risk boat of unknown circumstances. You have battled this better than me. As Star suggested - you could get a second opinion if you are so worried. Also, Tamoxifen is typically given to pre menopausal women, but can also be given to post, in some cases. Meow - I can smell. I think taste and smell are somewhat related if weak. You probably just need more time since chemo is still probably lurking in your body. Hope it improves soon. Welcome Princess Meg!

I left the Zofran downstairs, so I go down to get the bottle. Walked up to the kitchen cab feeling lightheaded, and started feeling weak on my legs, so I told myself get to the sofa and lay down. It was dark, kitchen light on, but as I headed towards the sofa I collapsed and fell hitting my mouth against the coffee table and was flat on my back. I knew I hit my mouth, (not sure on what part of the table). I stayed on the floor and decided just to lay there\u2019s a few momments until, I realized blood was pouring down my chin and side of mouth. I thought I just cut it a little However, looking at it when I got up this morning, I gashed it outside and inside my mouth and chipped my front tooth slightly. My front teeth are rough on the edge and I think when I hit the table, i bit my mouth through the inside. To make the story short I called the emergency oncologist number to ask why I was weak. He (not my doctor) said I probably lacked fluids- go to emergency clinic. They to,d me I needed to go to the hospital ER. There they checked my heart, took blood, gave me fluids, and stitched my lip up with 4 stitches and 1 stitch on the inside of my mouth! I left this morning at 9:30, got home at 2. I can\u2019t believe this happened! My poor friend took me to both clinic and hospital. I feel bad I ruined her day.

Feel so filthy dirty - need a bath. I had a sudden bout of diarrhea about an hour after I got home, and zapped the Imodium and later ate an egg and toast. Can't t eat well with this mouth hurting inside or out. The DR at ER said to keep Vaseline on it - not neosporan because of chemo drugs. (Due to some having neomycin which isn't good). I'm definitely feeling fluish, but no nausea at least. Hardly ate anything and I'm losing weight fast. When they weighed me I had lost 5 lbs. Had an Ensure, egg and toast. Lots of water. I hope I'm not scaring those with upcoming chemo dates, I can see thus is doable - just don't be a cluts and bust your lips!",

I think I would feel very good today except - Yesterday I knew I was constipated. Took stool softeners and they did absolutely nothing. So I went to bed thinking this morning I would make a strong cup of coffee and that should purge me. During the night hours, I kept waking up with abdominal cramps. Knew again I was stuffed up. So, when I got up I noticed every time I moved, I would cramp, break out in slight sweat - not good. Forced myself to drink the coffee, still no good. So, thank God, I have several friends to call. I called the friend closest to the closest drug store between her and I, and on her way to work was kind enough to pick up a laxative. Let me say I\u2019m never ever constipated. I bet only 3 times in my life, so this was one drug I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d need. So lesson learned. I drank the horrible stuff and then had the runs most of morning, but was glad I cleaned out my system and the cramps are gone. (A bit afraid to go anywhere - I might pick up some depends like a Rljes did for these unsure bouts). I went from one extreme to the other and back again. So - not to upset anyone about to go through this, make sure you have a laxative on hand just in case you need it. I\u2019ve had to take stool softeners after surgeries in the past, and they always worked. Don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t this time. Just eating differently and chemo drugs. Everyone is different, this didn\u2019t kill me, but I felt awful with the morning stomach cramps. Otherwise still tired, but moving along - if you get my drift! Oh, and next time I need to walk and move more.",

Having had a bypass three years ago, I was panicking that my BC treatments might be too hard on my heart - making my disease worse. There are some chemo drugs that are harder on your heart than others. Taxotere and Cytoxan are supposed to be ok and that\u2019s what I\u2019m on. I was reading articles on the internet that were old. (One problem with so much info on the internet - many not dated very well either). Some saying there was evidence that radiation caused heart disease - Yada yada yada. Like many of us - we panick reading too much. The articles scared the hoots out of me! I got no relief from my breast surgeon talking about it, so I made an extra Drs. appointment with my radiation oncologist (who talked to me for 45 minutes - love her too), and she put my fears to rest about how now there are newer advanced radiation machines that beam the rays away from heart and other organs. She will make sure my heart will be spared at least with that treatment. I was relaxed until the Oncotype test came back at 27. Then I panicked again. I can\u2019t say that these drugs aren\u2019t wearing my heart a bit, but as long as I can breathe throughout the treatments- I\u2019m ok and relieved. I also got reassured through my cardiologist. After my surgery, I had this weird feeling like my body didn\u2019t want to take a breath or make an effort to breath inward when I got up in the mornings, but I believe it was the anesthesia drugs left in my system from surgery. It was a very unpleasant feeling. Not a panicky thing, just a feeling I had to force myself to breath. It\u2019s hard to describe, and it went away as I got moving. It went on for five mornings. I was scared I would feel the same way with chemo drugs, but I haven\u2019t- thank God. I just want to live and breathe! I\u2019m glad to say, so far so good! Hope this clarifies what you questioned. No one else will probably ever have this problem. I just made sure all my doctors knew my most important concern was my heart, because without a functioning heart, the breasts take second place and heart disease is still the number one killer disease of women.

Mkn86 - Your strength getting through your many treatments have given the rest of us to carry on with ours. The Big D and constipation side effects are not fun, and hard to figure out what one should eat or not eat. Then if your taste is messed up, even harder. These cocktails definitely mess us all up in the digestive tract - ugh! I learned my lesson not to take the full amount of a laxative- that stuff is brutal!

I was wondering too and here's what I found as one answer. I don't think it helped me with my constipation, but maybe I don't drink enough. Staying hydrated can help minimize the fatigue and constipation caused by chemo, and it also protects your kidneys from the toxic waste buildup caused from cancerdrugs. Unfortunately the process of chemotherapy can actually cause your body to lose more water and become dehydrated. Thanks Bennigan! Back isbetter.",

She said it wasn\u2019t a common side effect from chemo drugs, but I\u2019ve read a lot of other blogs outside this site where a lot of people feel it\u2019s from the chemo drugs, so don\u2019t know. She wants me to take either ibuprofen, Aleve, or Advil 3 times a day for 5 days and if it doesn\u2019t improve, to let her know. I asked if there was any possibility of it being bone cancer and she said breast cancer that causes bone cancer happens through the lymph nodes, not bloodstream, and she was sure that isn\u2019t causing my pain. So I was a little relieved, but now I have to cram more drugs into me to see if they work. The muscle relaxer is for muscle spasms and doesn\u2019t do well for inflammation, so I have to try the anti inflammatory drugs through the holidays and see. I hope she\u2019s right. The neulasta pod is on my arm again - will blend into my neighbors star lights once again blinking along with the Christmas cheer on my bedroom walls",

My day was pretty normal - no more stomach cramps, but timing all these pills was a bit of a challenge. I ate quite a bit of food today, thinking it\u2019s going to catch up with me and cause more trouble. Compared to the first treatment, then I ate small portions just because I was skeptical of getting nauseated. I don\u2019t think that will be a problem and I\u2019m stretching those every 6 hours. Rljes- I\u2019d rather live out in a country community because you see the deer and lots of wild animals. My sister and her husband have a country type home where the deer come into their backyard. They purposely kept the grounds natural. They live under a lot of pine trees - so peaceful. Where I live, my backyard faces west. I\u2019m on a hill looking over a baby orange grove, but I have the whole western sky to watch the beautiful FL sunsets. I see the stars and moon changes at each season, the ISS floats overhead many times, so it has some advantages. Because of the grove, I see hawks, owls, sometimes turtles, possums, raccoons and sometimes sand cranes which are neat to listen to their chirps or shrieks. It still isn\u2019t the country though. Nonahope, Mom4gma3, Mkn86 - you all sound so busy with work, shopping, cooking, movie watching, and wrapping for holidays. I don\u2019t know how you have so much energy when you have these chemo drugs floating inside! I never hardly go anywhere for fear I\u2019ll have to run to a bathroom by surprise! Can\u2019t trust my body I guess. Plus, I\u2019m still trying to get use to being seen in a scarf or wig. I just feel so weird. Since tomorrow is Christmas Eve, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and hope everyones holidays celebrated have been good despite what we are struggling with. Next year should be better since it will end our chemo hassles eventually. Goodnight",

Sunday afternoon I could tell I was getting that fluish feeling, but yesterday was the worst. I couldn't even try and force myself to eat anything, whereas during my first round I could eat small meals. All I did yesterday was sleep off and on. Then, I got tired of taking pills every 4 hours, that last night I gave up both the anti nausea and ibuprofen. Only took my heart drugs. Just too much stuff to take on empty stomach! My back is more flexible since starting the ibuprofen, but the pain is somewhat still evident. Woke up early this morning and I think I'll feel more normal. It must be my age that causes me to have more side effects. Not sure, and I'm on a mild regimen - ??? Anyway, hope everyone had a fun holiday. Hope99 - as everyone has said, when in doubt of your side effects, especially the temperature, call your OM. I know mine gets all records of my calls through the emergency phone number, or off hours call number. Your OM can keep better track of your problems that way, so don't be afraid to call them even if you think it's nothing to worry about. Better to be safe than sorry. My hair bristles are poking my head at night. I have to wear a beanie to soften the touch against my pillow. Now I see why you girls prefer the baby butt smoothness! Oh - I was told I could take probiotics, but I think it depends on the perticular chemodrugs maybe. I haven't done so, but it was a question I asked my OM a while back.",

I\u2019m wondering if this lack of taste lasts a few more days, or the next month? Also my back is getting tight again.

The pain is definitely creeping back again. I found out that two of my friend\u2019s sister, and one\u2019s friend who had breast cancer, suffered back pain with their treatments.

A chiropractor told me that those muscles try to protect the spine when it\u2019s aggravated. The OM said chemo drugs aggravate the bone marrow, so the muscles do their thing. I think that\u2019s how I understood it, but could be wrong. Not sure if the hip works that way, in that case it probably is just bone pain.

Also they usually claim after five years that breast cancer isn\u2019t likely to return. Do the doctors just say it\u2019s just bad luck? You are so positive in your attitude, and strong to fight this situation on, but it makes me sad to hear that this could happen to any of us. Will the scan prove the cancer is in remission?

After my second treatment the ibuprofen seemed to help. As I posted last week, that I thought my back pain was going away for good. Now here I am stiff as a board again. Orangedaisy - no steroids were ever given to me. I don't think they effect the heart if you're only given it one time. My OM only said in her reply note (actually the note her nurse sent back), that she (OM), could give me steroids, but she didn't say whether or how it would help my back. Assuming now she might think my spine is in pain and not my muscles. It could be my spine is getting irritated by chemo drugs and my muscles are inflamed trying to protect the spine. I guess since I didn't hear back today, now comes the long weekend. It's pretty bad we sometimes have to be our own doctors. I think I'll try Tylenol in the morning and just hope this wears away. It's making me mad I should suffer like this. It feels like someone is crushing my spine down with weights when the pain is at it's worse state or as I stand upright. I tried stretching, making one leg go back behind me, but sitting reclined is my only relief. I'm going to have to sleep reclining on pillows again tonight",

I was sipping water to get pills down, made a breakfast smoothie one day, but a meal was like 5 tricuits with cheese. Not good. I never had a flu feel this bad, and it felt like an eternity to get any relief physically or mentally. I was dreaming weirdly,hoped the time would go by, but it didn\u2019t. Now my back is still acting up. This is Day 9 after treatment. All I can do is sit still most of the time. Now I\u2019m taking Aleve and Tylenol which isn\u2019t much help. Tomorrow I have got to get some answers from OM.",

My daughter and son in law are both medical people, (not near me), who have both said the clinics and hospitals are short staffed to save money. It\u2019s gotten worse in the last 15 years according to what they say. Lack of doctors - too many patients. It\u2019s a mess. It causes exhaustion with these 12 hr shifts they have to put in. I\u2019m going to try a Claritin pill and see if it makes my back feel any better. This annoying pain should be slacking off about now, but it still gets stiff at night as I change positions, and still have to push my weight around with my arms.

I did find an article that taxotere causes muscle pain, so I guess for me it had to settle in my back. This is Day 4 on the two drugs my primary gave me, and I still suffer some pain as I move. So, so tired of this. My urinalysis was ok too, so that means my kidneys are ok. I\u2019m glad he ruled that out. I called my OM nurse and told her about the results. My question to her was whether I should be taking these drugs by this Friday for my last chemo. Would it interfere with the steroids? Her answer was no, keep taking them. My surprise was that she said the steroids were for my bad flu feeling that makes me so weak. That made me feel better - as long as they work! If they could perk me up - yes, I could do this!(I thought they were for my back pain). My only concern is - what are these chemo drugs doing to my back muscles? Will this be permanent? I\u2019m really scared since it\u2019s not a common side effect. Nobody in medical field seems to know. That\u2019s scary in itself! The other thing the nurse said after I told her I was very nervous about this last treatment was, - you could quit if you wanted to, it\u2019s ok with the doctor. (Well, yeah, why would she care what I do?) I said, well, it might hurt my recurrence percentage and you all can\u2019t give me any idea what might happen. (I didn\u2019t say it sarcastically) then there was complete silence from her. Oh well, I\u2019m still numb about it. Three days to make up my mind.",

A quart of milk is hard for me to use up too. Much better to fix for two people. I hate wasting food, but they just don\u2019t sell it in itty bitty amounts.

This is the 5th week after last chemo. I sleep 8 hours and use to survive on 6.5 hrs of sleep. Not anymore. I just got back from the RO. She will do two types of radiation - external and accuboost. The external is the face down machine that rolls under me as I dangle, and the accuboost is sort of a plate type thing that is similar to a mammo machine. It targets more closely to the area where the tumor once was. Both machines will stay away from my heart and lungs. It doesn\u2019t squeeze or press the breast that hard, so that will be interesting. The good news is I only pay one doctor bill, and so I see her I think once a week, but I will not have to pay my co-pay each time like I did with chemo and labs. That\u2019s good to know, but I have no idea what my out of pocket costs will be after Medicare\u2019s 80%, or what my 20% will be. Ug. Tomorrow morning they will do mapping and tattoo me (mark me up). I\u2019m going to start the radiation treatments next Wednesday. The doctor will calculate the beams before then. I discussed the back pain, and she looked at my pointy breast, and said this happens all the time. It just needs a tuck - but not worried about it until next year. Radiation will shrink it some - maybe it will correct itself. I believe if the PS corrects it, he will cut above the nipple to get rid of the excess skin that is making point. Sounds gross, but that\u2019s the plan. Hope many of us get our energy back soon! Kat and Nonahope - will be thinking of you Thursday. Hang in there",

I see my RO tomorrow- might have results then. I laugh at my hair too. It is beginning to show some darker gray in the back, sides still very white, and the top so very thin.

However, I remember the chiropractor I saw last Dec. said that when there is spine damage, the muscles in your back can flare up trying to protect the back - something like that. So that made me think I had inflammation of the back. My primary doctor did not X-ray my middle back area in January,so that was a waste of money and not too happy with him since I complained my whole back hurt. Does anyone ever listen? It\u2019s taken me this long to get a doctors attention to my back pain!",

She told me that in most cases if the pet scan saw anything that suspected cancer, they (oncology dept.) will get a call within 24 hours from the radiology dept. and require a biopsy. That didn't happen, so I'm more relaxed about this back issue. She said the same for MRIs, but MRIs aren't used to detect cancer. So this sounds like they are wanting to get better images of my fracture and possible other damage to see how to treat it. My results won't be known until the 19th, but if it were a threat of cancer, again, they will call earlier. I see my regular oncologist on the19th, so this is why I learn on the 19th. My oncologist will order a bone scan (used for future comparisons) and start my hormone therapy then. I have this feeling if my bones are already plaqued with osteoporosis, these hormone pills might make it worse. Well - as far as radiation I have 3 more treatments to go! Yeyyyyy! My breast is redder at the top with a rash due to having been exposed to sun. My doctor said that will clear up in time. The rash is called something complicated, but I forget what the nurse called it. I'm horrible with remembering medical terminology. So I think I'll live through it. Radiation is nothing compared to the pain and hassles of chemo! It itches from time to time, but I try my best not to scratch it.",

Very strange how our nails differ. Nonahope - I\u2019m so sorry you are suffering so much with pain. So not fair. Maybe you need something different for the pain. Ativan (lorazepam) was what caused my legs to collapse when I fell! I think it along with chemo drugs just hit me too hard. I suppose all you can do is tell your doctor that the gabapentin isn\u2019t doing very well. I hope you get some relief soon. Maybe as you say it takes a while to work, but if it bugs you again tonight - give them a call first thing. You need relief and sleep! I wake up with my back bugging me from time to time - that area smack in the middle of my back where the fracture is. We are under a tornado watch and a cold front is coming toward us. Wind is picking up. These fronts cause havoc with warm air, so not looking towards the storm front. I hope I don\u2019t get a call from the clinic about my back tomorrow. I\u2019m still nervous about it. However it will be good to have my last day of radiation finished. My breast is very red at its top. Itches all the time, but ignoring that itch! ",

The kyphoplasty was more painful than I thought. Stinging with epidural injections, the probe that puts the cement in was painful off and on. I had to hold tight and grip the edge of the table. Three techs were there with the doctor. I also felt like I was going to faint, not from the pain, but from, I guess, the medication. It was hard not to jerk. It only took about 30 minutes. I had to pay $300 for the back brace that I wear for 6 weeks. This kyphoplasty is only stabilizing my disc, not returning it to proper height. That was a disappointment to learn. My bone scan was cancelled tomorrow, because my insurance hadn\u2019t approved it yet. Just as well, and my daughter will take a shuttle Thursday back to Lakeland from airport. I have pain pills and antibiotics. I hope my back pain goes away after this procedure. The grand cat stayed in bedroom all day and she wanted to be petted, so I slowly petted her, talked to her, etc. Then she sweetly rubbed up against me, but she then suddenly attacked and scratched my arm. She is one messed up cat! That was the icing on the cake for me, so I turned out the light, and said goodnight to her. She needs a cat whisperer! I\u2019m exhausted ",

It isn\u2019t improving much and my oncologist told me that kyphoplasty is a hit or miss ordeal. I won\u2019t see the spine people until week after next. My dexta did indicate that my osteoporosis has gotten worse since 2015. It\u2019s not severe, but bad. She is going to use Tamoxifen instead of letrozole, and my primary will determine what calcium pill I should take. So - the battle continues. I think because I gave up things like ice cream, cut down on cheese intake because of my heart disease is why my bones got worse. I\u2019m in a catch 22 situation. I take 1200mg of calcium supplements, but need to be at 1500mg. So another doctor\u2019s appointment and more drugs to add to my many drugs and supplements stash.

Congratulations Meow - what a long journey. I\u2019d be dead by now going through what you, Rljes and other have had to deal with. I think chemo was killing me slowly. You\u2019re all so amazing. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been a year now since my last chemo treatment. I know my radiation had started the end of February last year. I had my correction surgery on my cancer breast done in December. My PS wanted to reduce my right side also, but I think he made it too small - so nothing really improved much! I give up - just will be deformed I guess. Other than that I saw my oncologist mid January and bloodwork was at least good. I\u2019m on alendronate and letrozole. My dexa will be done in Spring. My back is much better, but sewing, or painting will aggravate it sometimes. I have slowed down so much from exhaustion. I\u2019m trying to exercise by walking, but the weather messes me up. I went to swim classes all summer and fall last year - best for my healing back. My hair is not growing very fast and it\u2019s still curly. Yuck! I had it professionally trimmed before Christmas, but it\u2019s still a curly mess. I\u2019m about ready to shave it off really short and wear my wigs again. It hasn\u2019t grown below my ears yet and it\u2019s all out of shape. It\u2019s so stiff and curly in the back that it just flips up in a tight roll. My bangs are somewhat straight, but it\u2019s all a mess and I can\u2019t do anything with it. Even a flat iron doesn\u2019t straighten it at all. It\u2019s wirery. Other than that, I\u2019m trying out a new hobby of reborning these lifelike dolls. I love to paint them. It has kept me very busy. I\u2019m not a doll person in that I collect them, and I definitely don\u2019t role play with them, but the artistry is so fascinating, so had to venture into this hobby. It\u2019s nice to live normal again and be able to do my fun things again and not worry about cancer. ",

I agree with the rest - check with doctor. Might depend on type of chemo drugs. I heard lidocaine cream numbs head or scalp pain, and peppermint oil helps with itching, but then it probably wouldn't keep the wigs very clean if it were used all the time.

The stabbing happens when i\u2019ve been in one position for a long time, like sleeping, and then if I move to a different position. It would be unusual if it were another cancer considering my breast cancer is clinically non invasive. I can\u2019t find any info that this has happened to anyone here other than, like you, years later, or with those with Stage 4 cancers where it has already spread. So again, it doesn\u2019t make much sense. I\u2019ll keep you posted. I\u2019m so sorry yours turned into bone cancer - especially when your original chemo should prevented it. You ended up in that 10% of recurrence. Question- were your lymph nodes clear 7 years ago?",

Iron would help your other problem, but again your doctor should help you choose foods to eat. Try some protein drinks like Ensure Enlive. Carnation Breakfast Essentials are high protein drinks and you can make smoothies out of them to make them taste better. I don\u2019t understand your platelet count as it measures differently than my score. Where do you live? Different country maybe? For example my platelet score measured between a normal range of (130-400). My score in my last lab was 351. My hemoglobin is on the bottom of normal, but my wbc has stayed normal to high especially after the neulasta injection. Worriedme77 - I see you\u2019re a Louisiana girl from a city I lived in for 14 years of my life. Welcome and happy New Years to you!

I didn\u2019t get dressed this morning, I\u2019m sitting here half sleepy in easy chair (only taking Zofran for nausea), and trying to watch tv, but not into it. It psychologically keeps me sane by hearing well people talking, but sometimes it bugs me. I feel almost nauseated, but that\u2019s why no appetite. I forced myself to eat a mandarin and earlier a small breakfast bar. Got my coffee down earlier thinking it would help me go, but didn\u2019t. I suppose I should be drinking water - yuck! Maybe some day they will figure a feel good pill during chemotherapy, but way too complicated. Maybe I should be moving more - hard to know what to do to feel better. No stomach cramps, so now starts the irregularities with that, since cramps help you go. Now that I don\u2019t eat much, that throws me off as to when I should go. It seems all I eat are anti nausea pills, and without food in stomach - seems senseless and wonder if that\u2019s why I feel worse. I too hate taking pills. Sometimes I feel I can\u2019t breathe well, so - I just sit here vegetative and worthless. It\u2019s fatique, but a very sickly feeling slowing me into slow motion. I think sleeping is all we can do to get through it. Does speed up the time at least. Since Zofran isn\u2019t suppose to cause grogginess, the chemo drugs are doing it. So - won\u2019t be on here now. Time for snooze. Heaven help us suffering today. Make us well again so we never have to go through this again! ",

If steroids help with muscle pain, that would definitely help the back pain I suppose, but I'm more worried of my sickness. I literally could not tolerate drink or food for three days. (Other than sipping nasty tasting water to get my pills down). I was so groggy, weak, just slept and kept telling myself this was ruining my body (or maybe my body was telling me!). I think I'd have to be hospitalized for 4th treatment. I ran out of ibuprofen, so took another Aleve and it seems to be helping me move better this morning. I'm sure this will go away by next week, but I now see a pattern of it occurring 5-6 days after treatment. I'm not scared of it having anything to do with bone cancer, because I don't have metastatic BC. Unless, by coincidence, got it out of the blue, but doesn't explain occurrence pattern after treatment. I do have arthritis mostly in knees, ankles and fingers. I also have mild osteoporosis typical to my age.

Could have been a TIA event telling me I had bad arteries, but my internist couldn't find anything else pointing to that then. After my second chemo treatment, I had TMJ for a whole day, but it went away. Well - the Tizanidine and Meloxicam are taking their time to make my back feel better, but I'll keep taking them. I did sleep better last night. I've already had an hour nap after I went out with a friend for lunch. It pooped me out, she could tell I wasn't myself. I wore a scarf for the first time out in public, but not a mask. This restaurant wasn't too busy with a crowd of people. I washed both my wigs, so had to wear a scarf. Didn't notice anyone staring at me though, but I'm sure if they did, they figured I had cancer. The Mobic pill is making me tired - as if I need more grogginess. I asked my primary I didn't need more grogginess, but did he listen? No. However a lot of these stronger pain pills do this and I guess it just can't be avoided.

I know the wait is driving you crazy. My blood pressure would be sky high waiting for the news. Keep us posted - good luck! Rljes - yes, you and I have had the worst time with bone or muscle spasms. I'm beyond hot or cold flashes, but for a while I was having to warm my feet and hands with the heating pad. They just didn't warm up for the longest time. Now that our weather here in FL is warmer, I haven't needed the heating pad. It's probably just a circulation problem due to old age for me. I wish your hip pain goes away - it has to be painful - just isn't right. I know the frustration you have with these doctors not finding the cause. I think Taxotere sucks! Well, since my pain pills have stopped, I am definitely experiencing more pain in my back. I found an older blog of chemo patients complaining about their on going back pains, so this is definitely a side effect caused by chemo. I don't understand how my cancer center can say it's not typical. For as many years as they have existed, they act like the chemo drugs have nothing to do with it. Surely I'm not the first one to have back pain issues after treatment there.Anyway, I'll monitor the pain level, and if it worsens, I might call my cardiologist and ask how to be careful with NSAIDS, if I need to keep taking them. Also - new aggravation is that I have this pesky cough. Not sick, it's just this phlegmy tickle type crap in my throat that makes me cough off and on. Maybe allergies - not sure as I don't have many allergies. Tomorrow is my afternoon visit with the radiation oncologist, and will learn what happens next.",

I see no new hairs that have fallen out, coming in at all. I read it can take 3-4 months after last treatment for hair to start really growing. Taxotere does make me nervous with the lawsuits against it. I read an older post of someone that had our chemo regimen, and she stated it took her hair a good three months > treatment to notice a regrowth. . So - I\u2019ll let you know if I see any changes. In fact this last week, my lower left side of my eye lashes suddenly fell out! (I may have rubbed my eye too hard, as eyeliner can cause my eyes to itch sometimes) My lashes and brows thinned out a little, but are mostly still there. ",

Mine is doing nothing but growing these feathery fine thin white hairs and that are here and there on my head. 8 weeks past last chemo treatment. My real hair is just sitting there doing nothing. My leg hairs are growing again - ugh! Hi Nonahope! Hope you\u2019re feeling okay and enjoying your weekend. Timeslikethese - I\u2019m so sorry your job faded out - it\u2019s so common when a company gets changed under a new management that the original employees get pushed away. I worked for a company several years ago that did the same thing. Doesn\u2019t seem right they can do that. Also sorry that your mother got a new cancer, but great that it was caught early, and wish the best for her as well as you. It must have been a great relief to get a clear report after your first chemo round. Maybe you won\u2019t need 8 months of treatment the second time around. Best of luck. Dark13 - You are lucky you\u2019re tolerating your Taxol really well. Keep fighting it and best of luck. My lashes that I lost aren\u2019t back yet either, but I didn\u2019t lose all of them, just the bottom ones somewhat. I\u2019m having fun with wigs - until the hot humid weather returns - then I might complain. I\u2019m hoping I have pixie hair by summer, but I\u2019m still bald as can be.",

I keep wondering if my bird head fuzz is going to be my only hair! Oh what a sight that would be.",

So, I guess I confused everyone. I finished chemo Jan. 12, and was to have my last one Feb. 2nd, but my OM said she didn\u2019t think I should have it, so I went along with it and felt like a complete failure, but my third treatment made me too weak. I didn\u2019t start feeling normal until the end of February. Lost weight and my back was killing me too. I still have back pain, but not as intense. Chemo did something unusual to my back, and I\u2019m only giving it time. Since my cancer crew is not concerned- it will be my primary\u2019s concern after I get through with radiation. I finished my Accuboost treatments Wednesday. I was given a nice bag, with drink cup, blanket and a fluffy pink robe. I thought that was nice. I did a survey for them that apparently donates money to this organization (breast cancer. Org.). It was a surreal experience and I found the physicist in their suits most interesting. (Only I would think that!) I thought my RO was doing the calculations, but they do it. Yesterday and today was back to the TrueBeam machine. A tech showed me how I was set up on the screen and pointed out the frame that the beams are shot through. I\u2019m glad I got to see that, because I know my heart and lungs are away from that beam frame. I could see my ribs on the screen. I\u2019m in the prone position on the Truebeam platform, and so the machine beams underneath me. I have 21 more treatments left. So far no irritation at all. I put Aquaphor on me every night. I\u2019m sure as I get past the half way mark, I will begin to feel something. I feel tired, but nothing like what chemo caused Anyway, I\u2019m glad most everyone in this group are nearly at the end to awful chemo. I think if I should have a recurrence, I\u2019d avoid chemo and let myself die. It must effect people so differently. My body could not deal with it. I hope my back is not permanently damaged. I still ice it, and take Advil when I\u2019ve moved too much during the day. (Just standing for two hours makes my back throb). I wish they would find something better to kill cancer cells. The treatments are so barbaric. It\u2019s a shame.",

Hopefully Star you won\u2019t have to have them for long. I had mine 5 days. Loose tops or tunic type tops would hide them. Orangedaisy - my hair is beginning to take off and grow faster. It\u2019s not as all white as I thought it would be. The bottom back has darker hairs coming in and some at the top. I think I\u2019ll have pure white at the sides and a mix elsewhere. I still look bald with such thin hair as it\u2019s now 1/4 inch long. However it must be finally trying to grow at a normal rate which for me was 1/2 inch per month. I think once I get the top length to an inch. I\u2019ll shave the sides short for a while until the top gets longer and then grow everything out. Gosh - it will be a year at this rate to even have a decent pixie. Having grey hair will be so different. I don\u2019t have a razor- maybe I\u2019ll just go to my hairdresser and see what she can do with iteventually. ",
