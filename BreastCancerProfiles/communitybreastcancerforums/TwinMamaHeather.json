Months ago, I felt what I thought was strange area in my breast, not necessarily a lump, but an area that just felt weird. When I went for my well woman exam last August {which was soon after I found the area}, the doc felt my breast and said that it felt like normal breast tissue. This completely eased my mind until a couple of weeks ago when, while in the shower, I came across what felt like a definite lump. My period was the following week {last week} so I decided I would wait until after my period to see if the area changed at all with my period, it felt like it did and I again felt better. But a couple of days ago, I just couldn't get over the feeling that something was \"wrong\". I have major health anxiety and have had many tests run for various things that have turned out to be nothing, but I decided to go ahead and trust my instincts and go see the doctor. Yesterday, I went in to the doctor. The nurse practioner I normally see gave me a clinical exam and then sent me for a mammogram and an ultrasound of my right breast. I was terrified, but still hoping my mind was playing tricks on me. Anyway, the mammo and ultrasound came back with a BIRADS score of 5 {highly likely to be breast cancer}. The radiologist who told me this did not have the best bedside manner, her first words were \"this looks bad\" you need a biopsy, so I was in shock and didn't even ask the questions I should have like, \"what features make you believe this is highly likely for breast cancer?\" and that sort of thing. The tech told me that she would put me in her prayers, which I know should have made me feel better, but really just made me feel horrible. :( I guess the next step is meeting with a surgeon and getting a biopsy. I am so scared and I am SO ANGRY at myself for not pursuing this sooner. I am spiraling into a fit of worst case scenario anxiety. I have twin boys who will be 3 in July and I just keep thinking that I am going to be leaving them without a mother. I am convinced that the cancer is spread all throughout my body and brain - I am convinced that by waiting I basically signed my own death sentence and that my boys will be growing up without me. I am so sad. And just so so MAD at myself. How could I have been so stupid? Seriously. Thank you for listening to me.
