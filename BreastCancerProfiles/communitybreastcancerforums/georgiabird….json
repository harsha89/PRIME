I'm beginning my chemo regimen carbo/gemt?? tomorrow, and I'm praying that my body tolerates it well. My pet scan shows no tumor in my liver, but my liver biopsy confirms that it's recurrence of BC. I also have some lung nodules that are suspect. I work full time and have two school-aged kids, and I am really praying that this plan is effective. Any particular tips on this chemo combo? I've been told it's a lot easier to take than the ACT combo I did 8 years ago, and that I might not lose my hair. I'm hoping that I can still work full-time for as long as this treatment is working. Right now, I've decided not to tell the folks I work with for as long as I can hold out. Thanks for any insight. Missy ",

There are so many treatments and terms that are new to me, and completely different than my last go round with this. I started my chemo last Friday, and it hasn't been too bad. I did have an ER visit on Monday, because I had chest pain, heart palpitations and almost passed out at work. I developed a blood clot the last time I did chemo, so they were concerned it was a pulmonary embolism. Luckily, it was nothing serious and they chalked it up to side effects from the chemo. Has anyone tried the Weisenthal Cancer Center to have their personalized chemo plan made? I read in another post to do that straight away, but it sounds like I'd have to have another liver biopsy to get them a sample they can use. Just wondering if it sounds like it's worth the money and the effort. I'm also considering doing a biopsy slide second opinion at MD Anderson. I have to wait until my first 9 weeks of chemo is finished before I can start that process. Southernsurvivor: my cancer was not evident by ultrasound or MRI, but was finally diagnosed on biopsy. I had elevated liver enzymes that kept going up and they couldn't figure out why. I never really experienced pain, but as the enzymes increased, I did notice a discomfort in my abdomen. It usually was worse after I ate. Hoping your scan is clear and it's nothing to worry about. Kaylynne- the Peru thing sounds interesting, but mostly because I've always wanted to see Machu Picchu. I agree with you that I wish I had plenty of time and money for travel. Hartrish- it looks like you are close to me. I'm in Smyrna, so we're practically neighbors. Praying that your scans show improvement. Heading back to chemo on Friday and hoping that it's uneventful. It does give me hope that there are so many of you on here who were diagnosed with mets years ago. Missy",
