A very good friend who lives in another state intimated to me that she was offended that I didn't immediately tell her about my diagnosis. I told her about a month later; fact is, I didn't tell many people - PERIOD - for a lot of reasons - which she knew - so she shouldn't consider herself slighted. For the first month after my diagnosis, I was too busy seeing doctors, getting tests, having surgeries, feeling terrified, and coming to grips with the poop omelette that had landed on my plate to play the town crier. Sorry that I didn't tell my story on your schedule, dear. Ironically, she's the kind of person who dribbles out information in such a way that you never feel you have the whole story. She just recently told me the truth of why she broke up with a former fiancee, and that happened 20 years ago! I'm really just stunned that she could be so petty, because she's usually a very warm & fuzzy type of person.",

If I were younger, having my ovaries removed may have increased my chances for future heart problems, Parkinson's disease, etc. The best you can do is research the pros and cons of an oophorectomy and make your decision on what you're comfortable with.

After the doctor/nurse did their \"hi, how are you, I'm nurse/doctor so and so,\" they'd show my chart to the student and say--each time, these very words--\"This patient is actually very healthy...except for having had cancer!\" I've always sworn that if I ever wrote a book about my cancer experience, I'd title it \"This patient is actually very healthy...except for having had cancer.\" Maybe it was the happy drugs they put in my IV, but I found it funny!",

My radiation onc said I might lose some lung capacity, but it wouldn't be noticible and wouldn't interfere with my ability to hike and long-distance bicycle. She didn't think it would damage my heart at all. About a week after the completion of radiation, I had an echocardiagram (due to having a staph infection, not radiation), and the cardialogist said my heart was fine.  Now that I'm recovering from the fatigue (I'll get to that later), I'm back to hiking and haven't suffered any shortness of breath. My radiation onc did say that, in the future, if I get a chest xray to mention to the radiologist that I've had radiation because some scarring will show up on the xray. I came through fine with no signs of lymphedema. Fatigue...boy, howdy, for the first time in my life I knew what it felt like to be tired! I've always been the Energizer Bunny, even at age 49, but I became more like a hibernating bear for about a month. I still managed to go to work and run errands during radiation, but not much else. However, the natural fatigue from radiation, for me, was probably worsened by having an infected portacath (ergo, the staph infection), starting Tamoxifen, receiving my first infusion of Zometa, and sinus drainage. But I'm back to bouncing off the walls again! LOL! Skin care...I mixed pure aloe vera gel with Aquafor and used that in the morning; after receiving radiation, I put on pure aloe vera gel; then I rubbed in emu oil at bedtime. I had painful burns under my arms for about a week; chest didn't burn much, but I did peel in those places. I'm fair-skinned, and my redness is almost gone. I continue to use emu oil to keep the radiated skin soft. My skin never \"broke down\" and got oozy. Hope that helps!",

During my darkest time, when I felt sure I was going to die from breast cancer (post-stage IIIa diagnosis and in the middle of chemo), my boyfriend's 85-year-old mother told me this story about her sister, Evelyn. Evelyn was diagnosed in the early 1970s, at age 49 (my age) with what was probably stage III cancer. She had a large lump and lots of positive nodes. Evelyn had a radical mastectomy and...nothing else. No chemo, no rads, no tamoxifan, no alternative therapies, etc. Evelyn is now in her early 80s. She's had some health problems, like all people in their 80s (pericarditis, arthritis), but her breast cancer never returned. I have met Evelyn on several occasions, and I can tell you she is robust and overall in good shape for a lady of her years. For those of you who have seen \"Fried Green Tomatoes,\" remember how Kathy Bates' character used \"Towanda\" as her battle cry? Well, \"Evelyn\" is my breast cancer battle cry. This story lifted me out of my BC depression and continues to inspire me. I hope it helps you, too.",

They don't have a separate category for you.\" That became a mantra I repeated over and over when I felt scared. Having worked in academic publishing, I can tell you that an article or report that is printed today was submitted 6-24 months ago. The writers spent at least six months to a year compiling the data and writing it up. Before that, they spent 5-10 years following the test subjects. So we're talking about treatments and technologies that were used, at a minimum, six years ago, and more likely eight. During my first meeting with my onc, she said that I had a 30% chance that the cancer would recur in five years, and that was using the numbers from the low end of the scale. That was before she prescribed me zometa, before I began taking Vitamin D3, before she knew how much I exercised (3-5 hrs. a week can cut your recurrence numbers in half), and before my oophorectomy. I'm betting my worst-case recurrence rate is down to about 10% now. Something else to consider: some people are not compliant with treatment. In an article on the Susan G. Komen for the Cure site, 37% of women taking tamoxifen are non-compliant (here's the link: http://ww5.komen.org/ExternalNewsArticle.aspx?newsID=42817). I imagine the same is true for those taking AIs. Those folks are also lumped into the general statistics.",

My onc didn't hesitate when I asked her for some xanax, though, and that certainly helped me cope! I was treated through my HMO. I realized even then that my doctors and nurses barely had time to treat the disease, let alone address any personal crises I was having. They see so many patients each day, and many of them, I'm sure, were in far more distress than I was. I'm wagering a guess here, but I bet that, to some degree, they do see us as a particular disease/cancer. Oncologists and surgeons are trained to fight that disease. Psychologists are taught to treat the psyche. Just recently, during a routine appointment, I asked my gynecological oncologist about a patch of dry skin I had, and I might as well have asked him to explain nuclear fusion! Just not his area. So if you are in need of counseling or a support group, speak up! Or, if you have difficulty doing that, is there someone--a friend, a spouse, a relative--who could act as your patient advocate? As far as what I did to cope (other than xanax), I shared my fears with my closest friends and my boyfriend, took long walks and hikes, kept busy, and always kept sight of my goals. I told myself daily this was only a short chapter in my life, and everyone has these dark chapters, and things would be back to normal (at least close to normal) before long.

That was during the era when children were excluded from \"adult\" conversations. I have mixed feelings about that. I knew my mother was sick. I knew she had cancer. I had no idea it was terminal. I knew about death, as my father had died of a brain tumor when I was six. However, day-to-day life was pretty normal and happy for me, perhaps because I wasn't burdened with all the details. My mother was admitted to the hospital for the last time in December 1969. A week before she died, my aunt told me the whole truth...that my mom's cancer had gotten worse, that it had spread elsewhere in her body, and that she was dying. I felt like I had been hit by a truck. I suddenly had visions of myself as Oliver Twist, which as it turned out wasn't too far from the truth, but that's another story. I alternated between feeling terrified and being numb. Now that I'm an adult with breast cancer myself, I wish I had more information about my mother's cancer (all of my aunts, uncles, and mother's friends have also passed - no one left to ask). I can't remember if she had her hysterectomy before or after the cancer or why. I don't know if she had lymph nodes involved. I'm not sure where her cancer metastasized to. She was diagnosed before the days of chemotherapy and hormonals and only received surgery and a crude form of radiation that absolutely tore up her chest. Every morning when I take my tamoxifen, I think of her...if she had been ER+, would that little pill have kept her alive long enough to see me grow up, graduate from college, become a published writer, etc.? So many questions, so few answers. When my oncologist e-mailed me last weekend to say that my CT scan results came back NED, I thought of my mother first. I think I could hear her sigh of relief all the way from the Other World. You know your children's level of sophistication better than anyone. A lot, too, can depend on the support structure of friends, family, and the community you live in. I've had almost 40 years to ponder my mother's breast cancer and how it affected my life during her illness and after her death, and I still don't have any firm conclusions...except, perhaps, that I wish she had had access to the medical advances available to me during my treatment.

I did tell my dentist and hygienist about my bc because I needed to let them know I was on Zometa.Fortunately, their reaction was akin to someone telling them they had a sprained ankle, and no big deal was made. BTW, if you're ever in England and someone tells you that a pub has \"good crack,\" they're not telling you where to get drugs. \"Crack\" means good conversation, good beer, good all-around atmosphere. I had a friend from England who was a smoker who came to visit a while back. I told him not to go into the neighborhood convenience store and ask for \"fags,\" especially since there was a gay bar just around the corner!",

The treatment plan she developed for me has been spot on, and I don't think I would have received better care or more advanced treatment if I went to M.D. Anderson. During chemo, I met with her every three weeks, two days before my infusion. During this visit, she would check me out physically, record side effects, put in prescription orders, and thoroughly answer every question I had (usually around two notebook pages worth), even though I'm sure I made her late for her next appointment. And she ends every appointment by giving her patient a hug. She is always available via e-mail for advice, questions, etc., and when I had a staph infection from my chemo port, she called me from her home on her day off. Her style is to be honest, but I think she handles tough questions very diplomatically. Dr. D was very focused and serious during our first meeting. When I later thought about it, I can understand why. Oncologists have to deliver some of the worst news to some of the most vulnerable patients. I'm sure some patients come unglued, are angry, pass out, etc. They never know what to expect when they meet that patient for the first time. Dr. D learned early on that I wasn't the type to wig out on her and that although I lost my boobs, I didn't lose my sense of humor (and yes, I have a bent for gallows humor). She actually has a marvellous sense of humor herself, and we enjoy joking around with each other.",

I also can't imagine that anyone with cancer wouldn't be \"anxious.\" Seems like that goes with the territory, no? I don't know if you've explored any of the \"extra\" things you can do to lessen your chance of recurrence, such as taking vitamin D-3, Zometa, and exercise. We had a good thread on this forum not long ago about Zometa; you may want to have a read when you get a chance. Cora - I know what you mean about separation anxiety with your onc. Believe me, I was one happy camper when chemo was over, but not seeing my onc every three weeks made me jittery. One of the things that I like to much about her is that she made me feel safe. As corny as it sounds, she was the rock I clung to during my cancer storm...someone strong, someone with the answers, someone who could fix every bad side effect and give me a pep talk every three weeks. I'm fine now, but it is reassuring knowing that she's just an e-mail away. ",

My boyfriend got the honors of buzzing my head and, to date, he's the only person who has seen me without my wig. He was also the first person to see my mastectomy scars. He emptied the fluid from my drains, recorded the amount, helped me bathe, washed my hair, and helped me dress. He went to my chemos with me, and the nursing staff just adored him. He went out of his way to make me laugh, even asking one of the chemo nurses how to protect himself from \"chemo farts.\" LOL!  I'll never forget the ensuing conversation between him and that nurse as long as I live! My advice...tell your wife how attractive she is, remind her that this (treatment) is a temporary situation and you'll both get through it, make her laugh (when it's appropriate), don't complain if she's too tired to do something, and listen, even if she's repeating something for the 20th time. And don't be hard on yourself because you can't \"fix\" this. That's the oncologist's job. Good luck to you both!",

I have heard from both doctors and women who've had reconstruction that it can be a painful, long recovery, and several women I've known had to have multiple surgeries due to necrotic tissue, poor healing, rejection of implants or flaps, etc. For other women, it's a few weeks of pain and they're fine.

The CT scan I had post-surgery, prior to chemo showed some tiny spots on my liver that were \"too small to characterize and too tiny to biopsy.\" My onc didn't seem terribly concerned about them, but it was a cloud that hung over me during chemo. She said the best case scenario was that the spots were still there and remained the same size 'cause that would most likely indicate they were benign and/or congenital. About a month after my last chemo, she ordered a follow-up abdominal CT and a 3-phase liver study, which I have a feeling she requested mostly to calm me down. Fortunately, the spots remained the same. My onc characterized me as medium risk for recurrence and will see me every six months and do blood tests but no scans unless I have symptoms. She's wonderful; I can e-mail her anytime, and she's even called me from her home on her day off! The nurses I had were all angels. I feel blessed.",

There are even breed-specific rescue organizations. I know that the outfit I help out is being flooded with pets losing their homes due to the recession and housing crisis. Here in San Diego, we often get floods of pets each time a large military deployment takes place. That's how I met my Maine Coon, MacDougall (aka, Dougie):  He's the big one (20 lbs.!) in the photo. His former guardian is in the Navy and was sent to Iraq as a photographer. Dougie is one of the best-natured, tolerant beings to ever pitter-patter the earth. The little prissy-pants is Simone as a kitten. She's a big butterball now. My boyfriend found her abandoned in the parking lot of a Rite Aid. ",

This was basically a CT scan that took shots of my liver at just about every angle, with and without contrast. This pretty much put to rest any concerns that something was up with my liver. You might ask your onc for one of these as part of your followup.",

My mom had a unilateral mastectomy and then radiation...lots of radiation, because that was basically all they had to offer back then. She tried to shield me from her illness, but I remember catching a glimpse of her chest one day...it was an oozing, purple and red mess of dying, radiated tissue. She wore Kotex pads over her chest because the drainage was so severe, regular gauze could not absorb it all. Like your mom, mine was sick all the time. Sitting on the couch in severe pain every day, all day, was all she could manage. She had to give herself an enema daily in order to relieve herself. At the very end, when she was at a nursing home, they had her on heroin to relieve the pain. Right now, Arimidex is playing hell with my knees from the hike I took last weekend. But that's okay. I would swallow battery acid every day if it mean't I wouldn't have a recurrence and/or die like she did.",

Because fodder was scarce, only the strongest and finest beasts were kept. The others were killed and, because citizens of the Dark Ages didn't have refrigerators, the meat had to be consumed or dried quickly. This called for a feast.  People often exchanged gifts of meat or other food they had grown, or linens they had woven, soap they had made, etc.  Thus we have the prototype of our basic Christmas morning get-togethers celebrated today. People would visit each other's homes to exchange goods, and they were often served a strong, hot drink or ale. They would toast the host and say \"waes hael,\" which is Old English for \"be hale.\" Recognize that word? We know know it as \"wassail.\" Yule fell during midwinter, the darkest time of the year. To encourage the return of the sun, fires were lit (think, today, candles and Yule logs). Pagans think very circular, and the year is seen as a \"wheel.\" The Druids of Britain would bless a log and keep it burning for 12 days during the winter solstice (how often does \"12\" show up in regards to Christmas?). Part of this log was preserved for the following year, with it would be used to light the new log, thus completing a wheel or circle. Today, we often hear Christmas referred to as \"the season of light\" or \"the celebration of light.\" The boar  (Boar's Head) was a favorite dish, as the boar was a solar animal, having bristles of gold like the rays of the sun. Today, many people serve ham as their Christmas dish. The ancient Celts and Norse also cherished evergreens, esp. at this time of year, as they are the natural symbol of rebirth and life amid winter's whiteness. Today, we decorate with pine trees and holly.",

I wish I could remember the names these herbs are marketed under to cancer patients, but their real names are mistletoe and cat's claw, both of which can be toxic. While researching cancer and treatments last summer, I came across so many blogs by cancer patients who went the natural route...colon cleansings, macrobiotic diets, herbal supplements, yoga, etc. Sadly, each of these blogs ended 1-2 years later with a member of the patient's family reporting on the blogger's death. That said, I would certainly think that positive thinking, exercise, and perhaps some nutritional adjustments would be great additions to your treatment plan. About your dogs...\"Cat therapy\" was an instrumental part of my treatment plan! There's nothing like being purred to sleep by a kitty nestled against your shoulder! Their unconditional love and funny antics helped me through the tough times. I'll bet your dogs do the same for you. Wow, your farm sounds great! My mother's family lives in New Zealand, and most of them are sheep or dairy farmers with farms around the size of yours.

I've read...and my oncologist agrees...that success in treating a distant recurrence doesn't depend on catching it early. If the cancer is going to respond to treatment, it'll respond whether the lesion is 3mm or 3 cm. Personally, I'm torn on how I feel about this. I'm very much a \"nip it in the bud\" kind of person. I fix the car the minute I hear a rattle; I don't wait until the rattle becomes a roar and then end up broken down on the side of the road. Same with my body. On the other hand, waiting for scan results makes me looney, so I'd rather not have the additional anxiety...and exposure to radiation...every few months. As I mentioned, my onc doesn't do routine scans unless you present with symptoms. My insurance is with Kaiser, and since they have their own treatment centers, scanning equipment, techs, and doctors, I don't think they save much money if they don't scan. How they decide may have something to do with how aggressive they consider a person's cancer or the philosophy they were taught in med school. My onc has mentioned there's \"East Coast and West Coast\" schools of thought with oncology. I don't remember her explanation (it was our first meeting; my head was spinning), but perhaps this has something to do with it. Yes, the risk for recurrence is greatest during the first two years.",

My dad thought this was hilarious, but my mom wasn't amused. LOL! When I was a teenager living with my foster mom in Tennessee, I remember getting out of bed Thanksgiving morning to use the restroom. I walked into the living room, and it was filled wall-to-wall with folk musicians, including John McCutcheon. I blinked several times and walked back into my bedroom and got back into bed. I thought I had dreamed the whole thing. She made the biggest breakfast I've ever seen that morning - biscuits, gravy, grits, bacon, eggs, toast, pancakes, sausage - for everyone there. When I was in college, I got a hankering for Thanksgiving dishes one April. I thought, why not have Thanksgiving several times a year? There's no law saying you can have turkey and dressing and cranberry sauce only once a year in November! So I bought a turkey and made the whole meal and invited my best friend over for dinner. That was almost 30 years ago, and she still talks about the time we had Thanksgiving in April!",

And I don't for a minute buy that most teenagers are wearing those bracelets because they have a burning desire to erradicate breast cancer...it's a \"legal\" means of being racy, of getting to say \"boobies,\" without getting into trouble.

That data is from 1989, which is like the Stone Age in the oncology world. Data that old might scare the bejezus out of recently diagnosed ladies. Since 1989, chemotherapy has come a long way, including the introduction of the taxanes and Herceptin. I'm not sure if tamoxifen was available in 1989 (and for the women in this study, many years prior to 1989), but the AIs were yet to appear on the scene. Radiation wasn't nearly as advanced as it is today. A member of my hospital's tumor board said not to pay attention to any cancer data more than five years old, three years preferably. Things have improved so much since 1989. I'm really rather shocked that Komen would have such outdated information on their site.",

However, I managed to work full-time, run errands, socialize, etc. I just hit the sack at night around 8:30-9:00 instead of my usual 10:30. However, the tiredness, for me, didn't come on until about week 4 of 6. My radiation onc kept asking, \"Aren't you tired yet?\" I finally said, \"No, you'll just have to try harder!\" LOL! That's what I get for being sassy! But a month later, I felt worlds better, and I'm back to my usual monkey business. Rads may not be as hard for you...I had other things going on at the same time that probably worsened my fatigue (starting Tamoxifen, a staph infection, Zometa infusion, sinus crud). I've known women who experienced no fatigue.",

I met with the radiation onc, she went over the plan she created for me and why she was recommending what she did; we talked about my general health, skin care, diet, and what to expect from treatment (i.e., possible side effects); she examined my surgical sites and told me everything looked good. She told me I would meet with her weekly, and she answered the questions I had at that time. Scans - yes, they do some sort of low-level CT scan so they can get your positioning tattoos correct (probably for other reasons too; doesn't involve drinking anything nasty or getting an injection). During the first five or so treatments, they did xrays (I guess to see if they were hitting their marks). For me, it wasn't a bad experience. My rad onc was very nice and professional, and I don't remember her saying anything discouraging. The techs were great and fun to joke with.",

I had shingles about 12 years ago (pre-cancer). Mine started like yours, on my back, and then under my breast, almost forming half a band around my torso. It was a pain that hurt clear through my body, from my back through to my front. As it progressed and I broke out in small blisters (like chicken pox), it hurt, ached, and itched at the same time. Ugh. There's about a 72-hour window during which you should get meds. After that, they aren't as effective. My symptoms started on a Saturday, and I managed to scoot into the doctor's office just in time. For pain, my doctor gave me a drug that in higher doses is used as an anti-psychotic. It may have been nortriptyline, but I'm not sure. She also gave me something to combat the virus. The pain and blisters lasted 8-14 days. I still had some nerve pain in the arm nearest to the rash, but that resolved over a few months. I don't have any permanent damage from shingles. Ask your doctor if cold compresses might help the pain and itching. Also ask about getting a pain killer in the class that treats referred pain (tricyclics, I believe), such as nortriptyline. These drugs and others are used to treat sciatica and fibromyalgia and may work better than morphine or Dilaudid. I hope this helped. Take care of yourself.",
