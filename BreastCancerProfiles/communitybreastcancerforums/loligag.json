It made me feel better knowing the tumor load was diminished. They did not touch my lymph nodes as it is of no benefit to us Stage IV ladies to have them removed. The surgery was only an hour and I had wire guides inserted beforehand. That was the worst part. I had zero pain after surgery and was released the same day.  I was Stage IV at initial diagnosis on 7/29/09 and had the surgery 3/17/10. They were able to get clear margins, which is key for the surgery to be of benefit to Stage IV.  I'm back on chemo and will probably have radiation after a couple of treatments. This will depend on the status of my liver mets. There's no rush for the radiation. The mets are more important being treated systemically at this time.   From my limited understanding, the breast tumor can still send out daughter cells to other parts of the body. By removing the primary tumor, it prevents this from happening.  I have an appointment at the Block Center near Chicago next Tues and will ask them about this. They seem to be in tune with latest research. ",

I still have it a little and have been off Taxotere for a year. I have to do daily exercises and wear support stockings. What also helped was having surgery (lumpectomy) in the midst of it. The fluids pumped through me during surgery got rid of a lot of the water retention. I lost 28lbs in 14 days. Don't let your Oncologist ignore it. Mine was slow to react. It can be miserable.

I'm ER-/PR- and Her 2+ and am on Herceptin and Taxotere. I also had pain at the biopsy site. I've had 2 scans and the second was way better than the first. I didn't have any SE's until treatment #5, when I started getting edema (swelling in the feet and lower legs). This is a known SE of Taxotere. Symptoms can be relieved by diuretics, elevation and support hose. My tear ducts also blocked up, causing me to have teary eyes all the time. I am scheduled to have stents installed in March. If this happens to you, don't wait to have this done as the ducts can get too hard and closed up. Don't got to an Opthamologist. I wasted time going to one. You need to see an Ocular Plastics specialist. Taxotere can be tough on some, but it's worth it.  Do whatever you can for stress and scanxiety control. If you can swing it get massages. I also listen to a lot of relaxation and visual imagery tapes. A great website to get these is www.healthjourneys.com.    A great documentary video that you might be able to identify with because the heroine is about your age is Crazy Sexy Cancer by Kris Carr. She also has a couple of books out. She has liver mets that make her liver resemble swiss cheese.   Anyway, this may be more info than you were looking for, but it comes with hugs and blessings.  Edwina ",

After the recent mastectomy I had, I now only have evidence of mets in my liver. So, if this works, I finally have a shot at being NED! Because I have mets in 2 lobes, it will take 2 procedures. I'm currently waiting to be scheduled, but the first procedure should be within the next 2 weeks. I'm having a CT scan on Mon just in case mets have popped up anywhere else. Once that is done, things will be set in motion. So, wish me luck!",

My onco had no opinion, but the breast surgeon at Stanford recommended it and I agreed after researching it. Also, I just felt better not having it there anymore. I had no node removal as it's not therapeutic with Stage IV. All we would gain from it is lymphedema. Last week I went to the now famous Block Center in Evanston, IL and the oncologist agreed with the lumpectomy. He said the primary continues to send out cancer cells.",

If there's a comment section on the review for you to fill out, you could put something there to the effect that the reference to your medical condition is irrelevant. Don't be too inflammatory in your statement. If you feel comfortable, you could mention it directly to the supervisor who wrote it so he/she can keep it off subsequent reviews. Sounds like it was well intentioned, albeit illegal. Most supervisors aren't aware comments like that are illegal. I guess what it boils down to is, is it worth making a stink over, considering the review is favorable. I think, however, that it is worth handling informally with your supervisor.  You could request your review be rewritten without that comment. If you don't nip it in the bud, it could spill over into other areas. If I was the HR Manager there I would advise the supervisor to change it and  apologize to you, unless they want a plaintiff lawyer with a laundry list of employment law violations come raining down on him/her. Not to stir the pot, but are you sure no-one got a raise? If you were the only one who didn't due to the \"bad economy\", heaven help your employer. ",

Luckily, I have a LTD program through work. They deduct for SSDI, but I can work a few hours a week which helps me feel normal. I couldn't keep on top of my game working full time. Between SSDI, LTD and part-time work, I'm not losing much income. My hubby carries the insurance. Best of luck to you.",
