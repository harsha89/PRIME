My skin was doing very well until after treatment 23 when the itching and redness suddenly woke me out of my sleep. I spent the weekend trying to find a solution. Finally around dinnertime on Sunday I discovered a warm bath followed by Aveeno skin relief moisturising lotion (with colloidal oatmeal.) It is not 100% but a huge improvement. Try it, you'll like it (as we used to say in the 70\"s). And for the record, I declare I am not an Aveeno shareholder.",
