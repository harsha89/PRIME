Now I am feeling pain that is waking me up in the exact spot where the 2nd tumor was removed back in May. They did an ultrasound 2 weeks ago and found only a thickened area, but this is happening on and off.  Talked to the oncologist and he said sometimes after radiation you can get pains, but this is so exact and so long after treatment, I m getting a little worried. Anyone had anything like this happen to them?Any suggestions.  Thinking of asking for another type of test if available from my onc. if this continues next week.",
