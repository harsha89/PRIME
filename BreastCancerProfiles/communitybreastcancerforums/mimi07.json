I am on day 11 after TC and finally starting to feel better; NOT that I was doing terribly; never had to take the anti-nausea medicine, never was really nauseous, but just overall yucky and tired, lightheaded and had to lie down most of the day.  I also have a constant mild headache.  The good news is that my blood count was normal - didn't feel like it, though.  I hope AZStacey is doing ok.  I'm sorry to hear that you had an infection right from the start!  And my other Jan 02 Jewel, kt57, good to hear that you are doing ok.  Now I have to face the inevitable - the hair!  I dreaded this day, but I'm going to get my hair buzzed tomorrow and get done with it!",

But, one thing that freaked me out was that when the nurse inserted the needle into my port, a whole bunch of blood gushed out.  The nurse was liking it, but WOW, it's like hitting a well!  Got scared a little bit there, but I guess that's normal. How did yours go kt57 adn AZStacey? kt57 - Thank you for your advice about the anxiety and the neulasta shot.  I am looking to get the inspirational CDs.  Renrel - Thanks for your encouragement and advice on coping with anxiety.  I am feeling much better now that I got my first treatment done.  ( I might not be saying this tomorrow, though..)  And the port is feeling much better today.  It is day4 and the pain is almost gone and does not bother me that much anymore.  So I can tell you, and I was really scared of getting the port, it is not that bad.

I know doctors make money from having us as patients, so you have to be careful.  I was skeptical about the Neulasta shot, as I am getting one routinely, and my other oncologist said he doesn't give the shot unless it is necessary.  I tried to get out of it, but my doctor told me that if I get an infection I would be hospitalized and I got scared.

As for my rads, so far I got 5 treatments, and I feel nothing yet.  I was getting my chest wall and internal mammary nodes because my tumor was at the 11 o'clock position, inner side of the breast.  But, now, after submitting my case to a conference, she is suggesting to add my superclavical area.  She says it is rare, but when the tumor is in the upper half of the breast, sometimes it will jump to the superclavical nodes.  Since I didn't get a clear margin, and because I am young, she thinks it is worth doing.  We also decided to add the under arm area too.  I didn't have any node involvement, but I had a lympha vascular invasion.  So, we might as well do the whole thing.  I was hot happy at first.  It seems like everytime we look into it deeper, the worse it gets.  But, I feel better now as I know I am doing everything.  Good luck everybody in your last phase of chemo!",

My hair did not completely go.  It is very sparse, but I still have some hair on my head.  My eyelashes are ok, but my eyebrows are thinning a little.  My other body hair didn't go that much either.  My nails!  They were feeling funny after tx3, and now I noticed that the bottom part of my thumb nails are turning a little black!  Although I was a little tired, I went to Elton John and Billy Joel concert the other night.  They kicked off their tour in Jacksonville FL.  I had a good time.  Got my spirits up.",

Like everybody is saying, taxotere is not that bad.  I feel queasy for about 5 days.  No taste buds for 2 weeks and just tired.  I stay in bed for a week, but other than that I am functioning ok. Bev3 - I feel for you.  It is really hard when a family member is sick.  I had to take my 6 year old to the emergency room when I wasn't feeling well.  (He was ok)  When my 15 year old woke up in the morning and vomitted, I got mad!  I felt so guilty, but I couldn't handle it.  Well, he was ok, too.  I could really relate to the arguing! Lisa - I hope your stiches are doing ok.  I remember you mentioning it before, too.  Wow, how scary! it bleeding.  I hope you can get it fixed, or is it something you have to live with until you finish chemo? Well, looks like we are surely and slowly getting towards the end of this thing.  Everybody hang in there!  Best wishes!",

I've been reading all of your posts and realize how much more on top of bc a lot of us are going through.  My heart really goes out to those who need to take care of others.  I think it was Misty that's taking care of her son with a liver problem.  I hope you can find a support group that can take care of your son at least during your bad days.  Have you contacted the American Cancer Society, local breast cancer group, or maybe support group for people with liver problems?  Or I heard you can get a nurse to come to your house and insurance will cover it. Life doesn't stop for bc.  We just have to be strong and help each other through it.  I'm so glad we have this forum. As for decadron, I took the pill, the day before, day of and day after, and I had it in my pre-med, too the first time.  I couldn't sleep!  But for #2 and #3, I didn't take the pills at all and just had it in my pre-med.  I did just fine without it.  Some oncologists prescribe the pill routinely as it is in the guideline.  My oncologist said that he prescribed it routinely when the pill first came out, but he doesn't anymore. And the Neulasta shot, I don't get any bone pain from the shot.  So for those of you that are terrified about the shot, just wanted to let you know the some people don't get the se. Ovaries... Do I need to take them out?  I don't need them anymore, but.  I thought the chemo would get us into early menopuse (I am 46) Wouldn't that dramatically reduce our ER and PR?  I was going to ask the onc why I need to do the hormone treatment if I go into menopause.",

Misty:  I am so happy for Malcolm.  I'm sorry that your blood count was low and had to stay over at the hospital, but you had your surgery so soon after your chemo.  I can see that happening.  I'm sure you will recover soon and both you and Malcolm would be coming out all fine together! Take care everybody!  I think I need to join a April rads group now, but this place still feels like home.",
