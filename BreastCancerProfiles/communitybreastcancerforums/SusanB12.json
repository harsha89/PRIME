      "Content": "SusanB12 wrote: I was diagnosed a month ago now, with Invasive Lobular Carcinoma of the left breast. The ultrasound said it was 1 cm and I thought I was going to have a lumpectomy. After waiting two weeks to see the surgeon upon physical exam he believed the area in question was 4.5 cm. and recommended a left mastectomy, then sent me for an MRI of the breast. Just got those results back and they found 2 spots in my right breast that they want to do an MRI guided biopsy on now which is scheduled for next week. I'm concerned this is taking too long but they don't want to perform surgery without knowing what's going on in the other breast. Since the first biopsy my breast has not been the same, very heavy feeling and tight. Can anyone offer any information. I am trying to research reconstruction as well but the surgeon initially said probably couldn't reconstruct immediately because I might need radiation, but I'm being told that immediate reconstruction can save you the trauma of waking up with only scars. I'm tring to tell myself it's only important to get the cancer out of there. There is so much to learn and so many people to talk to it's overwhelming. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",

Anyone else having neo adjuvant chemo? They are giving me three drugs, Cytoxan, Epirubicin, and 5-Fluorouracil.  I had no idea what to expect. I took Emend, Zofran, and dexamethasone.  I thought I was pretty well hydrated but the night of my chemo it was like all of a sudden I had a really terrible hangover and the nausea began.  The nausea lasted for 4 or 5 days or so along with fatigue for about a week and horrible constipation.  I also have a few sores in my mouth.  If there's a side effect I'll get it.  My hair started thinning on Friday 14 days out, so I got it cut shorter but not buzzed or shaved. Now everytime I touch my head a few hairs come with it.  The back of my scalp is aching.  Have been back and forth with the nurse a few times but waiting until Friday to see if there's anything more they can do to help with the side effects or I'm just gonna have to tough it out.  Susan",

Pathology of my biopsy on my right breast came back that it was a radial scar. I thought when I had a surgery date I would feel relieved and in a way I do. But it really hit me today I think was the first day I started grieving already. My breast has not been the same since it was biopsied. It is a lot smaller in size and it feels like a rock. In a way I feel like I have lost it already and it's just this thing that needs to come off. I thought I was being pretty strong until today. Log in to post a reply",
