I am currently on chemo (Navelbine) and Avastin and my doctor told me I could still take Provigil so I'm not sure which chemos you can't take it with as the other poster stated. It is expensive and my insurance company won't cover it because it is only FDA approved for shift workers, not for cancer patients!!  For me it has been worth the cost. I hope this helps.  Let me know if you have any other questions and good luck! Terry",
