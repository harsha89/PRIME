They had me do a sonogram after the MRI because of a lymph node that looked different. By the time I went for the sonogram two days after the MRI, everything was fine. I did have a sore throat for a few days, so that was probably it. It doesn't hurt to have it checked out though, because you never know, and peace of mind is very important.",
