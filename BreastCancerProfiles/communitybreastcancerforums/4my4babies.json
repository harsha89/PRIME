I made the decision to have a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction due to a strong family history.  I am not BRAC positive.  I just do not want breast cancer!  My younger sister lost a 5 year battle with breast cancer in 2008 at the age of 43.  I'm now 51 with 4 small children (two 10 year olds and two 7 year olds).  To my husband and me, this was a no brainer decision.  My intentions were to do it early 2012 but life got in the way and, as I'm sure you can imagine, it is an easy thing to put off.  Then another mammogram (negative thank God) rolled around and it finally kicked started me again.  I couldn't keep putting it off or I would have no one to blame but myself if I ended up with breast cancer. And after everything my sister went through, and everything most of you have been through, that just wasn't a gamble I was willing to take. Then the most amazing thing happened, after going down for a consult in October, and having everything sent in to BCBS for out-of-network approval, I was granted full pre-certification 29 days later!  No appeals...a slam dunk.  And I was totally ready to put up a fight.  We had loaded up my pre-cert request with everything I could think of: letter from my GYN stating why he was behind be doing this, a copy of my sister's death certificate stating she had died from metastic breast cancer, a copy of my birth certificate showing I was her biological sister and therefore high risk, and a two page letter from me that explained why I had made the decision I had made, why I didn't want a lat or TRAM, and why I wanted a DIEP in New Orleans.  Lo and behold, they approved me.  I think was still in the floor from the shock when she called to tell me it went thru on the first pass. So, flash foward to now. I know it's a big decision, and not everyone agrees with, but I suspect each of you understand why I made it.  Not only do I have four small children, but I am relatively young (or at least I feel that I should be!), and I can.  Like I said earlier, it's a no-brainer in my mind and in my heart.  I've made no secret about what I'm doing (and why) and I have had great support from friends and most of my family.  Ironically, my brother, who is an OB/Gyn, is the only one of my family who is not fully supportive.  Or at least not happy about it because he thinks I'm jumping the gun.  I say, yes, that's exactly what I'm doing.  I honestly think what bugs him the most is that I didn't consult with him before or during the decision making process.  But I had my reasons for that.  He's like so many other physicians across the country who are not familiar with the DIEP.  It amazes me really.  I would put my gynecological life in his hands (and that of my personal Gyn), but what each of them knew about the DIEP would fit in a thimble. Doctors, as a whole, seem to \"know what they know\" and practice what they know, but they truly do have blinders on when it comes to things outside of that until they come face to face with it.  I have no doubt that, once I am through with all of this, both my local Gyn and my brother will be recommending their patients check out what NOLA has to offer instead of the \"standard\" lat and TRAM. If you haven't already been there, go to www.breastcenter.com and read about the DIEP method of mastectomy and reconstruction.  What they do there is amazing and people come from all over the place to have them do their reconstructions and mastectomies.  Yes, most have or had cancer, but many (like you and me), don't.  The DIEP method is done other places but not all are experienced as they ought to be.  Hopefully you are close to some place that is or could travel to Nola.  You don't even have to go there for a pre-op. They can assess you as a candidate from pictures.. There is a wealth of information on this site....and SO many people who will help you.  Good luck Cher214 and God bless you all!  Nancy",
