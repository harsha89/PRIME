I also had my treatment time pushed back to 2pm so that has cut out out the need for a nap between rads and bedtime. I just go to bed earlier now. My skin started to feel burned and sore from #15/33. Until then I had been fine just using Miaderm 1x-2x/daily. So I desperately started reaching for other means to find relief. I tried cold packs, fresh aloe vera plant, Aquaphor, and Dermoplast spray but found no real relief. Also, the Dermoplast was so oily that it made most of my stickers come off. I called the nurse for advice and she recommended Miaderm again. So I slathered a big dollop on and let myself air off topless at home and it finally felt better! I think Miaderm is my best bet right now so I'm just going to apply it more frequently and more generously to save my skin. Hoping it will hold me up until the end... 15 more to go. Wish me luck!",

I leave early at noon to go for radiation. I do have to take a nap after radiation because I cannot make it until bedtime. Re: tattoos - I did not receive any tattoos either. I have the the magic marker markings and clear stickers over them which get replaced whenever they start peeling off. I was worried about skin irritation from the stickers but have not had any problems so far. For reference, I am on #14/33. Thankfully, the fatigue has been letting up since yesterday. It was bad for about a week. ",

Up until now I had only felt the burn but didn't see any real changes in my skin. It was ironic because the RO took a look right before the rads and said my skin looked great and I told him it was doing fine. Then I get home and see that my skin suddenly looked sunburned. The RO had said for sure by next week it would turn pink. It is the upper part of my breast that looks burned and stings a lot. I have some fresh aloe in the fridge which I can't wait to apply after rads today. I'm still slathering on the Miaderm daily. Monday I will be prepped for my boosts. I'm not exactly sure if the boosts will start Monday too or if it is just the prep. Praying my skin will survive this last stretch. Hope everyone has a great weekend and enjoys the short break from rads! ",

If you feel that something is wrong, I would get a second opinion from a gyno or specialist that can examine you and perform imaging tests. I know that many people like to rule out breast cancer when they hear the word \"pain\" but that is not always true. I had a lump that was causing me pain too that did turn out to be cancer. Praying this is not the case for you. Best of luck to you and keep us posted on your progress. ",

I started out at the gyno who referred me to a radiologist to get testing done on a lump that was causing me pain. At the radiologist, I had mammos and ultra-sound done which showed troublesome signs such as calcifications, so I had an ultra-sound guided biopsy done which proved I did have cancer. After the cancer diagnosis from the radiologist, I was referred to a breast surgeon. I also had MRI's done but not until after diagnosis and before surgery. I agree that you should get the biopsy done first. There is no other sure way to know. Getting it done by the radiologist sounds normal to me. Best of luck to you.",
