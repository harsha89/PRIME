      "Content": "Jul 8, 2010 07:30PM - edited Jul 8, 2010 07:31PM by LC815 Before I was diagnosed the first time, I was in an abusive marriage. I had three children in three and a half years and my husband (when he wasn't controlling me or abusing me physically and emotionally) was traveling/working.  I realized, when my youngest was three years old that something needed to change, but I really didn't know how to go about it.  I saw a therapist regularly and I remember coming to her with a decision.  I had decided to stay in the marriage for my children.  I was strong enough to endure whatever I needed to in order to keep their lives intact. This very wise therapist thought for a moment and then told me the earth shattering truth.  However  thought I could suppress my emotions, they would surface in another way.  She predicted that if I didn't get out of my marriage that my stress would manifest itself physically.  She never used the scary word \"cancer\" but she did mention lupus and fibromyalgia.  I did get out of the marriage, but the stress emotionally flattened me.  Four years later, I felt a lump and there my cancer story begins. I truly believe that the stress of my young adult life and being with my ex-husband caused my cancer.  In any case, it weakened me enough to let it flourish. Now, Stage IV, my ex-husband is decreasing my alimony and using insane and convoluted reasons to do so.  After reading this thread, I am reminded that this could lend a hand in progression.  Thank you for reminding me to relax, let it go, meditate, take Ativan, whatever I need to do to lessen my stress. Peace to us all. LC",

Nevertheless, she's thrilled the worst is over and that she overcame the disease without having to have a breast removed. Addressing the Breast Cancer Research Foundation luncheon in New York on Wednesday, Crow joked, \"If you've been following pop music, you all know how important cleavage is in my line of work - more important than your voice.\" Crow recently showed off her figure on the final stop of her six-week tour with singer John Mayer by appearing onstage in a skimpy bikini.

Yesterday, I called my primary care provider and demanded that she write me a scrip for a large amount of Ativan.  (Funny thing is, she's my best friend since high school.)  Before this, I was hording them and not taking them when I thought I could tough it out.  I couldn't.  She was worried about me \"relying\" on it, but then when I pointed out I've got STAGE IV BREAST CANCER and that addiction to Ativan would be the least of my problems, she dished it out. Also, when I take an Ativan in the morning, it opens my mind to Positive Possibilities which I do not think about when I'm overly anxious.  I also think anxiety builds upon itself.  It's like a bad headache.  If you don't get rid of it when it first comes upon you, it just gets worse and worse.   Same PCP (and best friend) went to hear Lilly Shockley of Johns Hopkins speak about a month ago at a BC forum.  Our docs are finally being informed about our depression and anxiety and treatments needed for both.  Make sure your onc and the rest of your medical team know how you are feeling.   It is the \"new thing\" in oncology to treat the mind as well as the disease.  Sheesh.  Why don't they just ask us? ~Linda from Baltimore P.S.  Until you get that Ativan prescription, Benadryl works wonders.  ",

Next day, see Surgeon.  Tuesday, lumpectomy.  A week later, \"routine PET\" before radiation.  Frickin' Stage IV.   What a beast. Two sub-centimeter lesions to liver.  Piece of cake, right?  Lupron shot, start Arimidex. Oopherectomy. CT scan.  Liver now RIDDLED with sub-centimeter lesions \"too many to count\".  Original two measure 1cm and 1.3 cm.  F.   Clinical trial: Taxol/Avastin.  Workin' way too slow for my taste but onc is pleased. Thanks for letting ME vent on your post, Lisa. I liked what you posted on Fitztwins \"cancer girl\" post tonight.  You really brought home how we all feel.  Cheated.  Pissed.  But there are good days.  For instance, I'm totally blowing off a clinical trial-mandated visit to my onc to see my daughter win the Senior Art Award at her school.  Ha! You'll have many more than five years.  I hope you have an aggressive onc and he/she is up on the latest.  My onc gave me \"a decade\" and I am sooo out to prove him wrong.  Two decades is my bare minimum.  I'm 48.  I've got three teenaged daughters and I'll be damned if I don't see them on to adulthood before I go. We ain't going down without a SERIOUS fight!!  Right,ladies!?",

So, without chemo am I doomed for progression?  What a balancing act.  I'm sick and tired, too (literally).  Sorry I just joined your chorus and didn't have anything worthwhile to add to help.  I'll wait here with you until the wonderful women weigh in.

One thing I've been advised to do is to stay \"in front\" of the pain.  That way you'll rely on less medicine and get better results.  Also, I like Zoh's idea of a palliative care doctor.  Also, the NCI gives positive support to accupuncture (no lie).
