I was considering the surgery, perhaps sometime in the New Year. A lot depends on how the arm acts when I'm in Africa.At my age (64) it wouldn't be for cosmetic reasons and my Physio said that so far the arm doesn't look too bad.(thats her opinion) I'm grateful that I live in Canada and our Insurance covers this surgery...so when in doubt I'll pray. Thanks again for being there for us Survivors.",

Just to tell you my LE and I are getting along much better...not to say the managment isn't a pain but hey girl I'm alive to tell the tale and I have to remember that when I'm feeling too tired to exercise etc. Have been wearing my sleeve consistently throughout the day and waiting for a sleeve and using a sleeve at night lent to me by a Physiotherapist.. I see where you're usuing Solaris product at night? Can you tell me more about it? I have bought kids tights (multicoloured with flowers etc.) to cover my sleeve during the day..I cut off the legs and there's your covering! certainly cost effective. I purchased a g-sleeve cover and wore it yesterday when I had some day surgery treaments done. The Nurses had never seen one before and were most impressed.I have heard that many Dr's ignore the pink 'Lyymh alert\" bands but God bless the Nurses  they pay attention to it.
