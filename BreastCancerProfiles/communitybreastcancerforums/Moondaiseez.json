At which point we call in a surgeon for a consult if the discharge is still clear and still happening. Sounds like the left side is most likely fibrocystic, the right side is still questionable. Could be a papilloma, could be cancer, could be just one of those things. So time will tell I suppose.",

No actual explanation for 8.5 months of off and on clear single duct discharge, but no cancer. So as the impending checkup reminds me of last winter's scare I felt the urge to check back in with you all too. In the last three weeks my other breast has started leaking from a single duct as well- but a milky non cancer looking fluid so I don't know if that will complicate or make diagnosis easier. Anyway- still trying to enjoy each day I am cancer free until someone proves it otherwise and wanted to share. Log in to post a reply",

Making me feel crazy even though it was coming out on its own as recently as just a few days ago. I debated canceling and just believing the doctor that it isn't cancer because in his 20 years practicing he's never botched a ductogram on a woman who ended up with cancer. But I have a lump on my neck- my googling tells me it is probably a swollen supraclavicular lymph node. It's been there about 6 weeks. I also have what feels like sand or a small uncooked grain of rice that appeared in the last few weeks in my armpit area. Also there is a shiny spot on my skin in a different area of the breast and a very thin tiny red crooked line has appeared over the spot with the hard sandy feeling. I have intermittent pain in various spots. And today my husband's co-worker lost his girlfriend to cancer. She was diagnosed yesterday and today she died. Log in to post a reply",

I am certainly not a medical expert and am trying to navigate my own nipple discharge scenario- but in general most nipple discharge is caused by benign conditions- including bloody discharge which gets the most attention. If this is your first mammogram then make sure not to wear lotions or deodorant and dress comfortably as you'll only have to undress from the waist up. Let us know what you find out. I am going in for a ductogram tomorrow as my mammogram and ultrasound did not uncover the cause of the discharge so I will think of you and wish you good benign results tomorrow",
