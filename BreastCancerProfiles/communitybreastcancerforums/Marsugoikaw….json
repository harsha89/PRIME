My pain wasn't too terrible. Breasts were MUCH less sore for me than the mastectomy procedure. My stomach felt like the soreness you feel after doing a ton of ab workouts except it's more external. It's hard to explain. I was off pain meds in four days. I was back to work after two weeks but could probably have done a week and a half. I have a lot of nerve pain at the grafting sites and some numbnss in my stomach still. I'm still lol dealing with lots of swelling in my entire abdomen area. Had to buy a lot of new clothing to wear to work since no pants or dresses fit me. This surgery is a walk in the park compared to the first one but just know swelling and new scar tissues can be annoying. Hope this helps. Good luck with your journey",
