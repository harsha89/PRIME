I wrote it off as a spider bite. 2 months later i was having stabbing breast pain. Went to er, they ran tests, but said they thought it was mastitis. I have not been pregnant for almost 7 years. so i thought that odd. Another Dr came in, looked at and examined the area, checked my glands, and ordered a mammo for first thing in the morning. I asked about work, and was advised work was the last thing I should worry about. I have the mammo (my first one ever) the provider advised me she had to review with the Dr. 30 some minutes later she comes back with the dr on the phone, and proceeds to tell me i need to see a surgeon asap. she advised i had moderate skin thickening. I also heard from the dr on the other end of the phone that i will need to have it staged immediately. so i am not sure if the lab results showed something, or what the heck is going on. Any insights on A) is this likely IBC. B) what else could show skin thickening on a mammo. or C) what can I expect at the surgical consult. Log in to post a reply",

So the hospital got me in with the surgeon. My sis works at the hospital, and says he is great. That does make me feel better. But its the not knowing that kills you. The nurse at the surgeons office told me the dr. Will want to run all of his own tests. And then I got a letter from the hospital stating it is imparative a see a surgeon asap, as they are the only one who can change the cancer diagnoses. Does that mean I have it? Or that they say I have it until proved otherwise? Ugh! And no one has even talked to me about other possibilities other than cancer. I too wish you all the best. You as well as all the other ladies here will be in my prayers.",

      "Content": "mzteeohh wrote: Okay. It was suggested I repost with ibc in the subject. (Thank you) here are the details as I know them I went to er after 2 months of reddish inflamed/ orange peel skin. Stabbing pain in breast. I originally thought it was a spider bite, and did 3 rounds of antibiotics with no avail. I am 30 years old. The sent me for a mammo. (After more antibiotics) I had my first mammo and the nurse left to speak with the dr. She came back and had the dr on the phone. She said my left breast was normal but want to follow up on that one in 6 months. However, my right breast has moderate skin thickening and abnormal outline. And that I need to see a surgeon asap. The dr on the other end of the phone stated a surgeon had to stage it. Now I have googled everything and all my symptoms point to ibc. Infact that is the only topic that comes up.I see the surgeon on the 7th at 9 am. They did a bunch of bloodwork and a sample of nipple discharge. This discharge only happens when manually excpressed. Now. I am lostt can they tell it is cancer already? Is it something that will show up on a blood test? I want to be prepared when I see the surgeon, but I don't know what to be prepared for. Do my symptoms sound like ibc? Any advice for the nervewracking sleepless days until Wednesday? Log in to post a reply",

I have spoke with the nurse at the surgeons office as well as the charge nurse at the hospital. They botth tried to be reassuring. However they danced around my questions. I did find out my birad score was 5. I have a whole list of questions written down to ask the dr on Wednesday. I have researched everything I can find online. I also received a call from a county cancer fund. And am going through them for financial assistance. Its just all so very sudden and scary. I have been trying to keep my mind off of it. But that has been hard. Hoping the weekend goes quick so I can get back to the school schedule with the kids and stay quite busy. I have prepared myself for the worst. And hoping for the best. Thanks again to every one. Has any one heard of any other conditions other than cancer have simular symptoms?",
