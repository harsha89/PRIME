So, I am here to offer some encouragement. I have some slight redness, beginning after a week and a half or two, but it hasn't gotten any worse, no itching, or pain, or discomfort. I don't feel anything. I don't have any fatigue, although I have been going to be earlier than I used to, which had been too late, anyway. No one told me not to wear a bra, so I do. The radiation oncology nurse gave me natural aloe vera gel with instructions to apply it twice a day, and also apply corn starch 4-5 times a day. So, I do that, and nothing more (and some days do the corn starch only twice a day). I do vigorous walking for exercise, and when I get sweaty I change my bra (even when I first get into the office, walking 1.8 miles from the commuter train station). Emotionally no problem. The radiation technicians and, RO, and nurses, are all very friendly. I was pleased that I could get in and out so quickly. My appointment was originally 7:24 am, but I gradually moved it up to 7:12, and so I have no problem making the 7:44 commuter train, which I did not originally expect to make. Best of all, it's spring! I see the signs of spring (greening grass, daffodils, etc.) advance every day on my way to the hospital which is a more scenic route than my regular route to a different train line and different station. (Last year we still had snow at this time; it was a bad winter.). I'm glad I am doing this in the spring, not winter, or hot summer. Good luck, all!",

Well, I didn't get any fatigue, and I'm almost a week away from finishing, but I work only 7.5 hours at a desk, and I know someone else almost done with radiation who works as a school teacher, which is more demanding but has perhaps 6 hour-days. But 12 hours-hour shifts sounds like a challenge. You'll have to do nothing else but sleep, exercise, eat, and just relax; and you'll have to be lucky. Anecdotally, age may also be a factor. Younger people tend to get less fatigue. Also exercise helps.",

My skin held up very well. Other than an overall slight darkening, just a slight irritating redness in the armpit and in the crease under the breast, which they said might peel. But it's not really itchy or painful at all. The nurse told me I can stop using corn starch but should continue using the aloe gel for another 2 weeks or so, until both breasts look the same, and also use aquafor (which she also gave me) on those two places that likely to peel, 2-3 times a day. gindugirl, boosts are another type of radiation, a different form entirely, that is also focused on the tumor area as a extra safety measure. But I think it's only post-lumpectomy, not post-mastectomy. It is aimed straight down, but does not penetrate far (because it's a different type), so it does not reach the heart and lungs. It's quicker too, because it does not need to swing to a different angle. I never got tired/fatigued the whole, time, other than sometimes feeling tired a little earlier in the evening (8:30 or so), but that would pass, and I would stay up until 9:45 - 10:30 pm (which is still an hour earlier than I did before surgery and radiation). I've been doing long walks more often. But I also wasn't recovering from chemo or a mastectomy, which can be a factor in fatigue. Age and fitness too, maybe. Good luck to the rest of you.",

At my 2-week post-surgery appointment with my surgeon, I didn't have the chance to fully decribe it, because she examined me so quickly and told me to get dressed again, before I could remember to point to it.

The mysterious muscle pain (only when I stretch a certain way or press on it) under my shoulder blade/back ribs on my lumpectomy/SNB side has still not disappeared after close to 3 weeks, but it is definitely getting better. Now I have a second little cancer: skin caner! It's a squamous cell carcinoma, biopsed on February 4, on my heel of all places (not exactly highly exposed to the sun). I've never had that before. So, I have a topical \"chemotherapy\" cream to apply to it for 6 weeks. It's fluorouracil, which is also one of the various chemotherapy drugs for breast cancer. (Fortunately, I only need to take it topically.) So, is there any statistical correlation between getting breast cancer and skin cancer? Really, I got both around the same time, since that mole had been apparent for over a year. I merely postponed seeing the dermatologist until after getting my annual mammogram.",

There are no visible differences on the skin, and no swelling where I feel it. But now a new thing. Yesterday, just over 3 weeks after lump surgery, a dermatitis type of rash has developed over about a third of breast, from a little above the incision to well below it. There is also tad up under my arm near the SNB incision, but not much. And it itches. I did wear a different bra that I had not worn in a long time, so I don't know if I has some sensitivity to the material, and it was a less supportive bra too.

I should have been washing it more with soap then, I guess. Although the rash did not seem significantly warm to me, my husband did notice a difference between the two breasts when he felt them. So, I went to the primary care physician's office today (surgeon's office is close for the President's Day holiday), and even though I still had no fever, the nurse practitioner diagnosed it as cellulitis and prescribed an antibiotic.

If there is breast tissue there to absorb radiation then there is less on the skin. Maybe a bigger breast helps too. Mine is a decent size. I am a little more red/pink under my arm and on my chest just under the breast, but the breast itself is only very slightly colored (I would not even say red or pink), and it's been 27 treatments so far. I've gone to the spring rads group and back, just like the weather here. We had daffodils and forsythia blooming, and then it snowed Sunday morning and again yesterday all day, accumulating several inches. I actually went cross-country skiing yesterday after dinner. I'm still hesitant of the bouncing I would get from jogging, but the cross-country skiing is smoother exercise.",

She needed chemo the first time, but not the second time. I didn't ask about surgery. The cancer was obviously in the other breast, since you cannot get radiation twice. She said she \"sailed through\" radiation the first time, but is feeling the fatigue more now. Age could be a factor, she believed, and I know two others who had radiation in their 30s and they did not feel it much. (I'm in the middle, at 50.)

Rather, itt is the individual antioxidant supplements, such as vitamin A, C, D, and E, that should be avoided, he said. I do take vitamin D, as advised by my PCP due to my low vitamin D blood levels. That's in my medical records, listed as a \"medication.\" My RO should have seen that. When I pointed it out, he apologized that he should have seen that. Oh, well, it's probably not that bad that I took vitamin D for the first 2 weeks of 6 1/2 weeks of radiation, but I am discontinuing now.

I am 50, but I postponed scheduling my first colonoscopy until at least a month after radiation therapy ends. I want to continue to eat, sleep, and exercise regularly and sufficiently to fend off any fatigue. At my annual PCP checkup in November I was reminded to get a mammogram, get a colonoscopy, and get moles checked by the dermatologist. In February I got a call from the PCP's office asking if I had made the appointment for the colonoscopy yet (but they didn't ask about the other two). I said not yet, since I was still dealing with the ramifications for the mammogram. I did go to the dermatologist in February, though, and it turned out one of those moles was skin cancer! (squamous cell carcinoma). I'm still doing the treatment for that: applying a chemotherapy cream to it twice a day for 6 weeks. It's getting more sore as time goes on.",

I used to go to be around 11pm, and wake up 5:30 - 6:00 am, but now I go to bed around 10pm, So, instead of sleeping only 6 - 6 1/2 hours per night, I am sleeping 7 - 7 1/2 hours per night, which is a better thing to do in general. I wonder if living on too little sleep for years contributed to the cancer. (My husband still sleeps more than I and takes naps.) Following the advice of this group, I am consuming more protein. And I have been exercising more, even before the radiation started, such as walking 1.8 miles each way to and from the office, and then maybe going on 3 mile walks on the days I don't go in to the office to work.",

      "Content": "Mar 10, 2016 02:49AM Katja23 wrote: Miscellaneous things: I was hearing differing things about whether it was OK or not to apply aloe shortly before radiation. My radiation nurse send the aloe was OK to apply less than an hour before, because it is absorbed well/quickly into the skin. Aquaphor, on the other hand, is different, not absorbed as well, and thus should not be applied so soon before radiation. (My rads are at 7:24 am, which is pretty soon after I get up, shower, and apply the morning aloe, before heading straight to work after rads.) I asked my RO at the second weekly visit if I was getting whole breast or whole breast + lymph node radiation, because the angle of the radiation from the side would seem to cover the lymph nodes. He said that it is planned for whole breast only, since I had clean notes from my SNB, but some of the lymph notes are in the radiation field anyway. I guess that's sort of an added bonus. I asked my RO about the amount of lung in the field, and he checked the scans on the screen before answering that it was very small, far below recommended limits, and yes, one could say less than typical, when I asked that. So, I feel pretty good about that, since lung-related side effects are very rare anyway. My radiation nurse also instructs to apply cornstarch 5 times a day to prevent chafing. I'm managing to do that in the larger, handicapped stall at work, but it's challenging not to get the powder on my (dark) pants and on the floor and everything. I feel the number of times/day to apply cornstarch is not so much the issue compared to when with respect to physical activity, as it is good to reapply just before and/or just after going out for a long walk, but if Iv'e just been sitting at my desk, I don't think it matters. Anyway, I am only in my second week of rads, so I have no effects showing up on my skin yet, so this is all just preventive/precautionary for now, like it's not for real yet. I have yet to meet and greet other patients. Today the waiting room was empty when I arrived and when I left, and the patient departing just before me was male. On the other hand, I am pleased to be in and out so quickly. My scheduled time is 7:24, and I arrive perhaps 7 minutes ahead, and I have gotten out at early as 7:30 - 7:35, and to my surprise was able to catch the 7:44 commuter train (have to park a 5 minute walk away from the station) twice so far. The next train is at 8:04, so it's not a long wait for the next train, and I catch that on the days of the weekly X-rays and the weekly RO visit, when I am there for 10 minutes longer. I like to walk from the commuter train station 1.8 miles to the office (rather than take the bus across downtown) for exercise, but walking fast gets me a little sweaty, and I am worried that, in time when I do get the skin problems, this will become an irritating problem. I cannot shower at work. I may have to change my bra, which is getting damp, when I get to work. Radiation dermatitis is a documented condition, but there is no conclusive really effective treatment for it, in my research. Another name for it is Radiodermatitis. That's the name in the National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings. My job (at a company that publishes indexed article databases for libraries, among other things) is to updated the indexing terms (subject headings) in the health area, and I often refer to Medical Subject Headings as a source. Last year, I received a request from an indexer to add the term Radiation dermatitis to our database of terms for indexing! So, now I looked up (InfoTrac library database) what had been indexed with it in the past year: 10 articles in medical journals. So, there have been some medical studies, but no solution to the problem. (I've decided next, that I should create a new indexing term for \"Hormonal therapy (Oncology)\" to distinguish it from general \"Hormone therapy.\")   ",
