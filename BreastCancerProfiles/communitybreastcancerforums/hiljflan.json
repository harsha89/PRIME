Ac and taxol seemed to clear my liver met (it was 1cm) and showed no sign of activity in December's pet scan. Just finished targeted radiation on 3 spine mets and chest after November's mastectomy. Started tamoxifen in November and hoping it will keep me stable for a while. Has anyone had long term success with chemo and liver mets? As in I'm hoping it might stay gone!! Hope you're all having a lovely day ladies.",
