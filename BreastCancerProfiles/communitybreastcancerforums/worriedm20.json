I am currently waiting for them to send me a time for a test but I am really nervous and hoping that anyone with experience can let me know what is going on.  I also noticed that my collarbone (near the breastbone) has been swollen on the right side (my lump is also in my right breast) for two months.  I am really worried that the two are related.  Log in to post a reply",
