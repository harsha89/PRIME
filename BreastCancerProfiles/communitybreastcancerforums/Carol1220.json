I am 10 days past my last treatment and still putting the Aquaphor on at least twice a day. With the Aquaphor, I didn't scab as much as I did when I was just using Calendula cream. I was reluctant to use the Aquaphor in the beginning because it was so much like Vaseline and it didn't come completely off when I showered. I was afraid it would 'cook' more if I didn't get it off so I stopped using it. My Doc finally told me that it wouldn't make a difference. My underarm is still tender but getting better every day. It was so raw and painful for about 4 days after I finished and the skin tore on the last day. I still get the sharp pains, too, inside but nothing that is excruciating. Hope you all had a nice weekend - we have rain now - good night for a book and a glass of wine.",

You want to use every tool at your disposal to get rid of this beastly disease. I am very fair too, blue eyes, and lost my blonde locks when I was younger - I get them at the hairdresser now! The staff will recommend creams to put on and if you burn, they will stop for a few days to let you heal. You can do this. I just finished Chemo yesterday and I know this will be a breeze compared to Chemo. You don't want to be in a position to have it come back. There is a lot of support on these boards - you should come her often for accurate information and encouragement. We can all do this together. Carol",

I imagine that it is convenient for the techs to have the tattoos in order to align machines etc. But if you don't have them, it would just take them more time to set you up. It's not like they couldn't do treatment but it might require x-rays etc every time you went. Not sure. Maybe they can do you at the end of the day if it takes more time. Kristin - 15 already - I was surprised at how quickly my first week went, must feel good to have 15 under your belt already.

Sometimes it's just hard to believe we can hear any more bad news. I am praying for your strength too. I am also a huge Springsteen fan. So glad you got tickets!

I didn't even realize until I left her office that I can't have an mri because of the tissue expanders I have. so she scheduled a CAT scan. Of course as soon as the insurance company ok'd the scan, the pain went away. Now I am debating whether or not to have the scan on Tuesday. I guess it's a little bit of having my head in the sand. I understand where you are coming from with the info we get or don't get from our docs. I have been doing what Wink suggested too - a big 3 ring binder and i ask for the results of every test now. At least I have no surprises. It's amazing to me that there are things in the reports that the Doctors never address. I don't know much about hemangiomas but I am hoping that it's a totally benign occurence. Skye, I am hoping your pain will resolve and thank God there were no mets. I know that hemangiomas can disappear completely on their own. Hoping for the best for you. Carol",
