Is anyone else watching Parenthood this season?  I was pretty impressed with how realistic they had been about Kristina's breast cancer (she's her2+).  But once they started putting her character through chemo, that seemed to be where it ends.  Of course they're having her puking all the time which seems to be shorthand for \"I'm getting chemo\" (even though I think a lot of us rarely get that nauseated anymore with the new anti-nausea meds).   But the thing that's really strange to me is that they would go to all those lengths to be authentic, but don't seem to be making her lose her hair.  I think most of us would agree that's one of the most traumatic and defining parts of the treatment process. Seems weird they wouldn't show that.  Or do they think it's too sad and dark?  I really would love if something in popular cultural would acknowledge this as a part of the treatment process and not just what you see on dying women in Lifetime Movies.

Thanks for the hair support!  All my friends think I'm crazy when I talk about how I can feel more hair every day (I'm still just bald to them). I actually broke down and put a semi-perm rinse on it to cover the white.  I picked a med brown and it did cover the white, but also turned the rest sort of orangish.  Now I look like an orangutan. Think it's time to follow up on some of your stylist recommendations! (lbrewer...I know that place...lived a few blocks away for years...will def cruise by).",

Do you know how many nodes they'll take out?  My doc found cancer in the sentinel and then kind of went ape-shit taking out nodes (she warned me ahead of time that's what she would do to play it safe). So glad it wasn't more positive nodes but kinda wonder if 28 removed was overkill.  But so far, no lymphedema problems (knock wood) and I don't think it made my recovery any harder.  Chemo isn't fun but totally not as bad as you might worry.  Emend is a wonder drug. ",
