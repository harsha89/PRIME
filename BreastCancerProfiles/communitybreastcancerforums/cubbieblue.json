I guess when people are claiming that they did or did not do chemo because of their age, there are actually things other than age being considered as well. It disturbed me to hear women my age (mid 50s) foregoing chemo at their MO's recommendation based on their age. They must not be mentioning the other factors that went into their decisions.",

To be honest, I was probably going to take the additional 4% benefit indicated by Oncotype and do the chemo either way.  Let me know if you have any other questions I can try to answer for you.   Best of luck to you.",
