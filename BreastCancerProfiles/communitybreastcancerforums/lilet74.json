I'm having Ultrasound Guided Core Biopsy. The Original Doctor's office told me I can't, but the Doctor that will perform the Biopsy said I can. No restriction on his side. Like what ChiSandy said, no Ibu, blood thinner medicine, Aspirin, Alcohol, This I can't. This people confused me hahaha........it's not funny but sometimes I can't help but laugh a little bit. But you know what I am going to follow what my Doctor ( whose going to perform my Biopsy) that I am allowed to ate and drink. Thank you for your time.",

Yes I asked my friend if she can take me to the Hospital tomorrow, and thank Goodness she didn't disappoint me. I will surely keep you posted about the result probably next week, and I hope and Pray to God that all goes well. Thank You.",

So which one do I need to follow? Now I am hungry :) because I don't wanna missed up my Biopsy tomorrow. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
