One drain, the one on my cancer side where I had the sentinel nodes removed (also the side where the drain insertion site leaks), is still putting out more than 20mL per day, while the drain on the other side is now putting out....almost nothing. About 12mL per day. So the question is, is the cancer side putting out more fluid because the lymph nodes are gone or is the other side putting out hardly fluid due to a clot in the internal portion of the tube?

I had a few particularly bad days of weakness due to heat. By my 4th chemo I had my acid reflux under control and had a dose reduction because my blood labs weren't keeping up and my dose was too high due to weight loss. I had increasing muscle weakness but less stomach cramping. My 5th chemo I just had yesterday. I don't know if they decreased the dose again because my blood labs still plummeted after infusion 4 or it's too soon for the side effects to hit me but I don't really feel it right now other than the fact that water tastes bad from the IV Zofran and to some extent\" tge dexamethasone, and I am hungry but my blood sugar is too high to eat due to the dexamethasone. By tomorrow I will be in dexamethasone withdrawal and my throat/esophagus will get very tender as result, making it difficult to eat. By day 7 that will abate and between day 7 and 10 the stomach cramping will start and I will start to lose my sense of taste due to the chemo, but it will return quickly. My fatigue is cumulative but I start to feel better by the end of my cycle. But I can have random bad days where I think I am fine and suddenly I am not, and I have not been in good enough condition to work.",

My oncologist uses a strong anti nausea protocol so I'm not sure if it's that working or just me, but here is what they give me for nausea for comparison. 1. I take dexamethasone pills the day before and the day after infusion, 8mg twice each day. 2. The day of the infusion, to prevent nausea I am given IV dexamethasone and IV Aloxi. 3. At home I have Zofran pills to take, and compazine pills to take if the Zofran doesn't work. I normally need a Zofran in the morning on days 2 and 3 and sometimes in the evening but have not needed to take the compazine. I take the Zofran at the first hint nausea. Eating a light, easy to digest diet starting a few days before the infusion might also help. Some people do a fast or partial fast of sorts, but that is something that she would need to discuss with her doctor, as fasting or calorie restriction can be dangerous for some people or if not done in the right manner.",

The day before chemo and the day after chemo: I take 8mg of dexamethasone in the morning and 8mg in the evening. The day of chemo: I am given IV dexamethasone, and an IV anti emetic. Originally the anti emetic I was given was IV Aloxi (palonosetron) which worked the best for nausea...I had almost none, but the Aloxi gives me a bad taste in my mouth for most of my cycle so I was switched to IV Zofran (ondansetron) and then my infusion after that they also added IV Emend (aprepitant). On these I have bouts of nausea for the first week but it's manageable and I don't have as much of the bad taste. For nausea at home I have zofran tablets. On the Aloxi I just needed one the day after chemo and maybe one the next day. The key is to take it at the slightest sensation of nausea. I was given compazine tablets in case the zofran tablets don't work but I haven't needed them. If I start to feel sick while out and about I sit and rest...I could also take a zofran but a lot of times it's just my blood sugar dropping so I carry hard candies to suck on and some water. Additionally, the dexamethasone gives me acid reflux so I have been starting Prilosec (omeprazole) a few days before I take the dexamethasone and I stay on it until a few days after chemo then switch to Zantac (ranitidine HCl) to wean off of the Prilosec....a lot of people stay on the Prilosec, I don't because I develop a tolerance to it then get rebound reflux when I try to stop it.",

I realized after my last infusion was delayed that the dexamethasone alone was giving me reflux so I started the Prilosec four days before the dexamethasone. I had my infusion Thursday, took the last Prilosec Saturday morning and a Zantac around 4am. I probably could have used another day of Prilosec because I am on the verge of reflux but hopefully another Zantac will put me in the clear later.

The center I go to does neoadjuvant chemo standard for my type of cancer...I wasn't thrilled about it for a few reasons and ultimately they said I could do adjuvant if I wanted to but it's a respectable facility and I decided to follow the protocol because I knew my knowledge might be lacking and I did not want to be at odds with my treatment team given that fact. But the more I learn I learn the more the rationale for neoadjuvant chemo seems to not apply to me... 1. A greater chance of breast conserving surgery: I'm not keeping the breast. I don't want it for a variety of reasons. 2. They can tell if it's responsive to the chemotherapy: I understand this. It has been, but I've read genetic testing can now determine this. Why do an experiment when you don't have to? 3. It allows them to test new drugs: I'm not a part of a clinical trial and no one is giving me experimental drugs even if I requested them. So moot point. 4. It allows them to predict survival rates: Some studies refute this and telling me my tumor shrunk x% so my chance of recurrence is Y is irrelevent to me because whether I have a 40% chance of recurrence or 10% of recurrance I will still have the same screenings with the same frequency. Am I missing something here? Is there a good reason for this or am I needlessly spending my summer existing with a lump of cancer in my body?

One of my parents drove me and usually stayed a few days after, just providing some company, but they were typically gone by the time my worst side effects hit.

Once when I decided I was well enough to walk up to the market and then discovered I wasn't well enough to walk back, and the second time, when I was stuck in bed with unusually bad side effects as a result of my side effect management schedule getting messed up, but I had to pick up some anti influenza prophylactic my MO called in for me after potentially being exposed to influenza. I took an Uber home from the market, and made a desperate plea to my sister to drive across town to pick up and deliver my medication.

The second PS (25 years of experience) I consulted with was initially going to just leave me flat until reconstruction due to concerns about subdermal implants but when I mentioned the concerns raised by my BS and the first PS about going flat temporarily he relented and said he could put small expanders in just to keep some slack there.

      "Content": "Feb 7, 2019 12:03AM - edited Feb 7, 2019 12:07AM by WC3 This is how it went for me. Day 1: Sleepy due to Benadryl. Bad taste starts due to Zofran. Day 2: Burning muscles starts. Mild nausea. Managed with Zofran. Acid reflux starts if I did not stick to reflux management schedule. Day 3: Face turns red and throat/esophagus becomes tender due to dexamethasone withdrawal. Day 4: Bone pain starts from Neulasta. Managed with Claritin and rest. Day 5: Bone pain peaks. Muscle burning and weakness peak. More nausea...not sure why it was always on day 5. Toughed it out to avoid prolonging the taste changes Zofran caused me. Day 6: Face no longer red, throat/esophagus tenderness is fading. Bad taste alterations due to Zofran is fading. Acid reflux, if present, is fading, but tongue is getting sensitive and tender. Food feels too rough. Day 7: Tip of tongue has enflamed taste buds. Food tastes partially normal. Stomach cramping starts. Managed with small portion sizes and Imodium but from this point on, restrooms must be nearby. Day 8 and 9: Much the same as Day 7. Day 10: Sense of taste starts to fade due to chemotherapy. Things start to taste bad again. Day 11: Same as day 10. Day 12: Can't taste much and most of what I can taste tastes bad. Day 13: Sense of taste starts to return. Tastebud inflammation going down. Day 14: Sense of taste improving. Getting strength back. Pulsating tinnitis develops. Day 15: Starting to feel like I'm getting back to normal except for the stomach cramping. (This gets pushed back with each infusion). Day 16 to until next infusion: Side effects continue to fade. Some notes: I was originally given Aloxi during my infusions for nausea and this controlled the nausea very well but altered my taste perception such that things, and particularly water, had a bad, linger taste and this lasted most of my cycle. I was switched to IV Zofran and Emend during the infusion. I had more nausea with this (the day 5 nausea) but it caused a far less lengthy taste alteration. Water tasted bad for most of the time I was on chemotherapy and I could only tolerate lime flavored sparkling water for most of it. I typically hate lime but my taste perception was altered by the Aloxi and Zofran such that lime flavored water tasted like unflavored water while unflavored water tasted bad. My urethra would get irritated and it would burn to pee. I think this usually happened around day 7. I got thrombocytopenia (low platelets) consistently and this would cause bruising/bleeding under my skin and any other place my blood vessles broke. Before I figured out how to get the stomach cramping under control, the cramping, plus the thrombocytopenia would cause me abdominal tenderness. I also developed pretty severe anemia and felt generally bad as a result. I am almost 4 months PFC and still anemic but recovering. I developed some vision issues probably from the anemia. Nothing major, just weird.",

I understand doing an 18F NaF PET/CT is probably off the table because it would be too soon after the previous one on terms of radiation exposure but would a bone scan really see something that a PET/CT didn't?

I had TCHP which is taxotere, carboplatin, herceptin and perjeta, which is one of the standard treatments for HER+ breast cancer. Taxotere and carboplatin are the chemotherapies and herceptin and perjeta are the targeted therapies. I had 6 infusions at 3 to 4 week intervals and will continue with herceptin and perjeta for a year at 3 week intervals. I have no side effects from the herceptin and perjeta, other than a runny nose, but some people get diarrhea from the perjeta. An alternative to taxotere is weekly taxol. I don't think there is a significant difference between the two except taxotere, on occasion, can cause permanent hair loss and taxol is sometimes easier to tolerate for those who have a sensitivity to the taxotere. The C might also be different when taxol is used, though I am not sure if this is always the case. For the chemotherapy, I needed a ride home from the infusions because they gave me IV benadryl as one of the premeds, which made me sleepy. Some people are also given ativan, though it's optional. Fir TCHP, there is a risk of allergic reaction in the days immediately after the infusion, during which time my mother would stay with me, and my weakness would peak around day 5, during which time I was often alone but usually managed. I had to call my sister for help once when I got off of my side effect management schedule and needed her to pick up something at the pharmacy for me. I had a bilateral mastectomy and needed help after surgery getting my shirts on for a few days, and reaching a few things I had forgotten to take down from the cupboard before hand. I didn't do much cooking during chemotherapy and would have really liked a home chef. I made good use of hot food bars. It helps to have people around but you don't need a village. I would talk with your husband and get his input and also see which treatment facility you like best.",

When I was properly diagnosed, my doctor who ordered the tests and who has been practicing for decades told me it needed to come out ASAP. Then the path report came back as aggressive as it gets, I find out they want to leave it in and do chemo first, it grows half a cm in the month before chemo and can be seen poking out from my breast, the chemo seems to shrink it, and then the PS wanted to push the surgery date way back during which time I won't have anything stopping it from growing again.

      "Content": "Aug 1, 2018 02:52PM WC3 wrote: Hi Roxanne: tl:dr I wouldn't worry but read on if you want to know why. The radiation from mammograms does not stay in your body at all. You can think of X-Rays from an external source like an X-Ray machine like light from a light bulb. It's emitted when the machine is on and goes away when the machine is off. The difference between X-Rays and light from a light bulb is that we are kind of translucent/transparent to X-Ray photons...the \"light\" that is the X-Rays can shine through us, but some of the photons \"collide\" with the molecules in our DNA and are high enough energy to knock some of the atoms off and damage it. This type of radiation is called \"ionizing radiation\". We are exposed to ionizing radiation in small amounts on a regular basis in the form of UV light from the sun, gamma rays from things in outer space, and various forms of ionizing radiation from small particles of radioactive minerals and elements in the environment from naturally occuring sources and nuclear testing and accidents. These sources of radiation contribute to what is called \"background radiation\". In most instances, when cells are damaged by radiation, they self destruct or are destroyed by the body. This is how radiation is used to treat cancer. But in some rare instances the damage constitues a mutation that causes the cell to become cancerous or sets it up for it or it's prodigeny to become cancers down the road. This is how radiation causes cancer. It should be noted that anything that damages a cell at the level of the DNA can result in cancer. The more often ionizing radiation cells are bombarded by, the greater the chance of a cancer causing event. The odds of cancer from one or even a few annual x-rays or mammogram are very low, especially today because technology enables them to use very little radiation. You are more likely to end up with cancer from sun exposure. The PET/CT is a different story. The CT part of the PET/CT is just like getting an X-Ray only you are getting a lot of them at once. The more of your body that is being imaged, the more the more X-Ray images have to be taken. How dangerous is this? The amount of radiation a CT scanner emits varies a lot between scanners and facilities but in the U.S., the risk of cancer is calculated to be 1 in 2000 from a typical CT which is not \"full body\". It puts it in the \"limit use\" category. The PET part of a PET/CT uses radioactive isotopes that are injected in to you. They are attached to a substance that hypermetabolic cells such as cancer cells uptake quickly an in large quantity, concentrating the radioactive isotopes and causing the radiation to be emitted from that spot at levels the detectors in the scanner can detect. That shows up on the images as a glow. The radiation from this substance dies off after a few hours. A PET and CT can be done separately but are often done together when looking for cancer. The radiation exposure from a whole body PET/CT is considered to be significant compared to how hoe much radiation we are exposed to on a regular basis. A whole body PET/CT in the U.S. exposes a person to about 8 years worth of background radiation and that puts them in the \"not for routine use\" category. But it's important to understand what is meant by \"significant\" with respect to cancer risk. Your risk of getting cancer from a single whole body CT or PET/CT in the U.S. is thought to be around 1 in 200 when you are 20 and declines with age. While the risk of cancer from a whole body PET/CT for any one individual is relatively small, the medical community has too look at it in terms of how it translates to incident among the populations. If 200 20 year olds have whole body PET/CTs they figure 1 will get cancer from it. If 1 million 20 year olds get whole body PET/CT they figure 5,000 will get cancer from it. Around 2 million PET and PET/CTs are done per year in the U.S. I would not worry about a few mammograms or conventional x-rays used in regular screen or for diagnostic purposes. I would not worry about a single full body CT or single full body PET/CT as they are typically only done when it is thought there is a more significant threat to your life or QOL from something else.

A lump that is suspicious to you but has not been seen should never be designated as benign. Demand an MRI or see another breast surgeon for a biopsy and do not be afraid to help them find the lump.",

The potential for this may be minimized with the use of anti inflammatory drugs during surgery, which my doctors are willing to try.

If it isn't, I would have surgery 5 weeks after, which I am ok with. They want to do immediate reconstruction to minimize complications. The plastic surgeon, however, said he schedules 6 to 8 weeks from the last infusion. Not thrilled but would do 6 max. I got a call from his scheduler bumping this to 10 weeks out!!!! I told her I was NOT ok with that! She finally said the soonest she could give me was just under 7 weeks out and tried to play this off as being in my best interest. I see this as dishonest and am not ok with that. My cancer is grade three, poorly differentiated and aggressive and I have have increased vascularity in my bones that make them easy for micromets to get to. My platelets completely recover 4 weeks out from my last infusion and are in the middle of the normal range by this point. Maybe this cosmetic surgeon is a good one but I am not comfortable with the time frame and do not appreciate the scheduler trying to pass this off as being in my best interest when I know it is not. I am considering going with a different cosmetic surgeon who can do it sooner. The catch is, I will likely have to go with a new breast surgeon and will likely have to transfer centers if I do this. If I go with a different cosmetic surgeon within the same system it would have to be with a colleague of the first and I worry that will cause hostilities against me and I don't want someone who dislikes me doing surgery on me ( I had a bad experience when shopping around for MOs somewhat related to this). So I am inclined to just leave the system for the surgery even though I like the breast surgeon and don't really want to have to do this. My other option is not doing immediate reconstruction. I don't care about being flat for a while but they believe it will make reconstruction more difficult. Opinions?

I was actually in the hospital before starting treatment, with a tube in my chest due to lung issues and it was very easy to see how someone can get an infection. It was very difficult to keep the tubes off the floor when I had to use the restroom and sometimes the tubes that had touched the floor would touch the bed sheets and I had to ask for my sheets to be changed a few times to avoid the contaminated bed sheets from making contact with my incisions. It seemed like I could do a much better job of keeping things clean at home but I was plugged in to a suction device in the wall. But I'm sure a lot of infections start in the OR. By week 4 after my infusion I am starting to feel back to normal. I'm anemic but my platelets arw fine and I can do a slow 2.5 mile walk.

If my final chemo gets delayed due to low platelets, as the previous two have, that will make the time between by final infusion and surgery 6 weeks, which is within the time frame the BS wants. There is some evidence that around 6 weeks might be best for those doing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and I am fairly anemic even at 4 weeks out from an infusion and my healing has been slow so maybe I do need more than 4 weeks to recover from the chemo. I also spoke to my chemo nurse and she thought it was better to do 6 to 7 weeks than schedule 4 weeks out and have to cancel it due to low platelet problems and risk not getting another date quickly. I'll run it by my MO at my follow up.",

I don't like cutting off healthy tissues but I feel that \"bad idea\" feeling when I consider keeping it. My paternal grandmother had breast cancer at the same age as me and did not have a recurrance but developed an \" entirely different\" breast cancer a few years later in her remaining breast. My second cousin on that side also has breast cancer. I do not know if she had it in both breasts but my great aunt on the other side did and possibly my great grandmother, also in her 30s or 40s. I apparently have \"very dense\" breasts and my cancer was misdiagnosed as benign the first time I had it imaged after finding a lump. So my breasts may just be prone to cancer in general even though I tested negative for mutations on a little over 30 genes tested. Additionally, despite my own vigilance, my cancer was originally missed/misdiagnosed after the first round of imaging. The breast cancer concordance rate among identical twins is low, interestingly, even when there is thought to be a genetic componant (other than BRCA1/2 mutations) but this isn't surprising because we see a lot of variation between twins in genetic tumor causing conditions, for example neurofibromatosis. In neurofibromatosis type 1, one copy of the bad gene is inherited, and for symptoms to manifest, the person must have the second \" good\" copy of the gene in some cells acquire a bad mutation. Additionally, epigenetics, the phenomena of genes being on or off, probably plays a part. When twins are born, they have most, but not all of the same genes on and off. The older they get, the greater the difference in their epigenome becomes due to natural variation, lack of a synchronicity, and different environmental factors, most probably minute. The functioning of the genome becomes quite heterogenous and even when a tumor associated genetic factor is present, it can be either directly or indirectly modulated by other genes and environmental factors which, even in conditions like neurofibromatosis, when both twins have the disorder, they do not necessarily have the same tumors in the same exact places. I don't want to cut off my good breast but I know six things. 1. My body facilitates breast cancer. 2. I have a family history of breast cancer in both breasts, at least one was not a recurrance but a second cancer. 3. I have dense breasts, making breast cancer more likely to develop and more difficult to find/spot. 4. Too many radiologists aren't as good as they should be (I conclude this not just from my own misdiagnosis but other instances of radiologists missing very obvious things with other family members...brain tumors, liver lesions, etc. 5. My cancer was missed due to 3 and 4 despite me finding a palpable lump and being concerned enough to have it checked. It almost killed me, might still kill me, and another miss in the future can kill me. So can surgery but now I have to have that anyway. 6. I controlled for most of the environmental factors that I could to prevent breast cancer. My grandmother and I have vastly different lifestyles and had vastly different pre cancer diets. I excersized regularly, ate no red meat and very little poultry...I was a vegeterian from the age of 10 to 20. I ate a ton of cruciferous vegetables...at least from 20 onward, some turmeric even though I don't like it, a fair amount of anti oxidants. I ate a low glycemic diet and was actually was close to dairy free for a number of years in my early 20s. I got cancer anyway. What else could I have done that I could reasonably have known to do? Now I have the option of removing the \"good\" breast and doing so is the only other thing I can do to take an active role in preventing cancer in it. True tamoxifen might reduce my chances of developing cancer in that breast but by how much really? And I may not be able to safely take that without a hysterectomy. If I had reason to believe my breast cancer was an entirely random fluke, had no compelling family history, and I had fatty breasts rather than dense breasts, I would keep the other breast.",

I discovered that in my case it was from the anti nausea medication...IV Aloxi, and to a lesser extent, Zofran, not the chemotherapy. I am going to try Emend for my next infusion. Before I figured this out though, I found Lime flavored La Croix sparkling water tasted ok to me. It's typically too bitter for me when my taste buds aren't impaired.",
