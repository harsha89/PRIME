I am getting my port tomorrow and starting the TCx4 on July 31st.  For some reason, getting the port and scheduling the chemo has made having cancer real. I had the lumpectomy and SAVI radiation and those treatments just didn't seem like they were for CANCER.  This does.  How did you do with getting your port? Where is it? Thanks for taking the time to do this!  Blessing and prayers!  Christi",

I stressed for nothing.  I have my first round of chemo this Friday and am trying to stay calm about that.  I am a nurse and should know better, but sometimes the emotions take over.",
