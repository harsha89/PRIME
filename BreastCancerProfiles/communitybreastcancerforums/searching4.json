Years ago, I had a cervical biopsy when I had carcinoma in situ of the cervix.  I first had a cryotherapy (freezing) procedure but the cells still showed up.  I liked and trusted my gynecologist, who was also the surgeon, and I didn't do any research or question her advice.  She told me the only side effect of the procedure would be that I might have to be dilated by hand during labor if I ever had children.  It was the exact opposite!  My cervix was shortened and I lost two babies at 5 months into pregancy.  I finally managed to have one child with a specialist who practically cemented my cervix shut!  Had I known, I might have still undergone the same procedure, but I might have asked for a 2nd shot at the cryotherapy first.  All in all, I'm glad I didn't get cervical cancer, which my sister did, but it taught me a lesson.  By the way, I'm the only one I know who was diagnosed with cancer at a second biopsy.  Still, a biopsy diagnosis is generally a cancer caught earlier than one felt as a lump.

When I looked after, it was grey!  The nurse gave me Aqaphor cream for now and Curasol gel, which is mostly Glycerin, for later.  She told me not to use the Curasol unless the skin got red.  She also told me a good trick:  put it in the refrigerator!  Then it feels really good. Seems that this is the typical time when rad patients start to feel the side effects.  So, my nipple hurts, and I can feel some pains in the breast, but it's very bearable at this point.  I can't tell about the fatigue because I had a deadline this week and I've been working too hard.  However, I am training for a 100-mile ride in support of a breast cancer network in October, and I've been riding a lot of miles, so the fatigue can't be too bad.  My only concern is that the ride is October 25, shortly before I am done with treatments.  But this is how I channel my stress--  the ride makes me feel like I am doing something positive with all this. tchmusik:  Congratulations on your tumor marker results!  Jeano:  I actually asked about the IMRT because I had seen it with my research.  My rad onc does use it for left breast tumors to avoid exposure to the heart.  So be glad:  it is newer technology and you will get more control over your radiation exposure.  My oncologist is also recommending Arrimidex, but I am nervous because I lost 7% bone mass in my spine since my previous bone scan.  I'm going to ask about Evista.  I am definitely post menopausal.  Although for some reason I'm having night sweats again.  It's weird-- I soak through my pyjamas.
