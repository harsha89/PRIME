It turned out to be benign. No bc tumors present at that time. Then early this year, I felt 3 tumors. It all happened very fast it seems. My doctor says I have a very fast growing cancer. I had breast cancer 20 years ago as well. It seems I am a cancer machine",

I feel like I baby my no boob side. I know I frequently hold it and message it. As I have written in another thread, my lymph node dissection left my arm and chest extremely sensitive. One minute numb, the next it feels like my chest is filling with cement, the next firecrackers going off. It is much better now. I have not bought any bras except for the soft thing my sis bought for me. I am purposely shedding weight and will wait until I am happy before buying more clothing. A picture was taken recently of me. Not bad. The very colorful tunic hid my flat side. I am hoping my other boob will shrink as I lose more weight. I am old now. I could care less about being lopsided. I am not shy about my condition. I feel many need a reality test about what it means to have breast cancer. For those that are young, my heart breaks for you. Losing a breast is not sexy. It is a loss. It is life altering.",

However, with significant weight loss, the big boob is smaller now too. I wear a sport bra. Took a while to find the right one. So I looked flat chested now, plus very thin. Nobody cares. I am seen daily in tight exercise clothing at our local gym. I undress in locker room. I simply do not care. I feel great. I have not felt this good in decades. That is all that matters to me. Women say they are sorry for my condition, meaning cancer. I tell them not to be. It does not bother me. I can do everything now that I could do decades ago. I feel blessed",
