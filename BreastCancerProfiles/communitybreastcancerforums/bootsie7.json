The side effects are so scary and everyone says \"you are going to be OK.\" Really?... I have had two surgeries since August 1st...after my LBMX the cancer was much worse than previous biopsies etc revealed. I needed a second surgery last Wednesday for positive superficial skin margin. Also had a port inserted. I am ILBC Stage 3 Grade 2 17/21 nodes estro. + Prog - Her2 - and genetic testing was negative. I am diabetic but weight loss, exercise and nutrition controlled ..for now. I barely take an aspirin and now I have multiples of drugs to deal with. A/C 2x4 then Taxol 2x4 then radiation...  Yet so many encouraging comments from everyone shows me I am not alone nor in the worse case scenario with this dread disease. I lost my Mom to cancer years back. My Dad , Brother and another brother fighting a cancer since March...so maybe I have a reason to be a bit freaked out. Thanking all for being brave and sharing all you can to help others.  ",

Just got home from visit to Nurse Oncologist and it was a good informative visit. I am as ready as I can be. I wish it was the 20th. Time to get this thing started. I plan on bringing my Nook, and journal...they have a TV attached at each chair and the fridge is stocked well at Chemo with snacks coffee tea etc. Looking through lists to see what else I might need or want. Wishing you well! We can and We will!! ",
