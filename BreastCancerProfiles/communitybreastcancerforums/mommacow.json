I do not go back to my bs for the results until the 20th and the waiting is killing me! The lab gave me a cd of the mri images and I took a look at them. Is it true that bright white spots are bad and darker spots are usually not? Or that uniform spots are usually harmless and jagged looking spots are bad? I was just wondering if anyone else had an MRI and knew which to look for. I know only my dr can interpret the results but I was hoping for a little \"warning\" before seeing him.
