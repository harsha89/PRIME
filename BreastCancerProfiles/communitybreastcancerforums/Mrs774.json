I am 32 was diagnosed with triple negative invasive dutal carcinoma on march 31 2016. As soon as I left the hospital with my best friend, we ate our way through montreal. I wanted to feel normal for the afternoon and not worry about anything other than tasting everything lol. I started AC chemo on May 5 and I feel great. My husband and I together shaved my head in order to get ahead of the chemo, it really was cathartic. I have only had one round so far and go again this week as i am one week on one week off. 4 rounds followed by taxol and some other one i have not heard of before. I have to give myself neupogen shots everyday. I feel great though. maybe becasue I am still working everyday and follow a vegan diet and take lots of vitamin D and B12. I walk everyday to keep my mind clear and my body strong. YES VEGANS GET CANCER TOO! DO NOT LET ANYONE CONVINCE YOU OTHERWISE is it just me or is anyone else annoyed with the lack of stores that carry caps for cancer patients? I do not want a wig and am ok with being bald but i work in a restaurant and do not want to scare anyone lol I haven`t taken any of the meds that they gave me except for the magic mouth rinse. Staying hydrated and drinking protein shakes are very effective. Sleep well and eat well, practice breathing exercises, i`m hoping I will continue to feel well through out this journey, A positive attitude goes very far. Best of luck to all of you! ps never be afraid of sharing the tmi stories. you`re not alone!",
