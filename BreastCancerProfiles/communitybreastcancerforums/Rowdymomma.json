I am assuming they only did the one size because of my age and the pain was just in one breast? The Dr. could not feel the lump as it was very deep and she didn't press that hard to find it. Hoping to get results tomorrow.",

The machine was straight up and down for one then it tilted sideways for the 2nd. I have no idea if it was 3D or not. Mucki1991- thank you, just wasn't sure if they normally measure the lymphnodes? Sierramtngirl - thank you and good luck with your biopsy!",

      "Content": "Rowdymomma wrote: So a few weeks ago my left breast started hurting. Didn't think much of it as I just started my period. I don't normally have breast pain but still thought it was from my period. While I was changing about 3 days after it started hurting I noticed a red spot above my nipple. I proceeded to do a check and thought I felt a small pea sized lump near my chest wall. The area was extremely sore. Shortly after I had a rash on breast but that went away in a few days. Also started having pain in armpit. Had to wait for Dr appt but armpit hurt quite a bit, redness kind of went away and just over all left breast felt different. Anyways Dr sent me for a diagnostic mammogram and u/s on left breast. I am 36yrs old and never had a mammogram before. So this morning was my appt and they did the u/s first because I was only 36 and if needed they would do a mammogram. Well when the tech was doing u/s she took a lot of pics, at least to me but then she checked my left armpit because of the pain I have been having there. I noticed she measured a couple of masses which I assume were my lymph nodes? She finishes up, then goes to see if they want a mamm done too. They do so I went and had that done. They only did 2 images though and I though diagnostic was more than that? The first one didn't hurt but the 2nd one hurt a ton. My armpit was jammed up in the corner of the plate and it just hurt. Anyways, my questions are. 1. Why u/s before mammogram? 2. Is it normal for them to measure lymph nodes? I have no known history of bc in family. Thank you ladies! I am hoping I can get results tomorrow and not have to go the weekend wondering. I had this done in a hospital so not sure when radiologist will take a look at tests. Log in to post a reply",
