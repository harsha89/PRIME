Its good to know im not alone. Id like to know how other people cope, i dont want to be on pain meds all the time and id like a good nights sleep, its so hard to sleep becauae if i move my arm a certain way or lay on it i wake up in pain and its hard to get back to sleep. I wasnt warned about lymphademea either, after mt surgery they forgot to give me my after care insturctions and i ended up in the er the day after my surgery because the pain was so intense and i didnt have anything to refer to as what was normal, and the er doc and nurse realy didnt know much either. Im glad i found this site",

Ive had two c sections and about 6 other surgeries in my life and this is bt far the most painful. Does anyonenelse still have pain from their lymph nodes being removed months after the fact? I did have rafiation started just over 2 weeks afyer my surgery and the beam did hit my lymphnodes, i know that that made it worse. Ive had to take pain meds and i use a soft pillow that i press against the scar and the pressure helps a bit, i just want to know if anyone else has lingering pain and what helps them libramommie75@yahoo.com Surgery 8/4/2012 Lumpectomy: Left; Lymph node removal: Left, Sentinel Dx 8/20/2012, ILC, 1cm, Stage I, 0/9 nodes Radiation Therapy 9/30/2012 Breast, Lymph nodes Hormonal Therapy 11/2/2012 Log in to post a reply",

I wasnt given any instructiins about exercise at all, and in the middle of all this i wound up in the hospitial for a week due to a dental infection and got sent home with a picline for my antibiotics, so im sure that didnt hekp matters",

Alot of my skin has come off now, but its still very very tan, it was almost black at the end of treatment, and it feels so rough. Ive used several creams and lotions like emula, lidicane, silverdrum i think its called,, and eucerian, 100%aloe, calming cream, radidurm and a powder that i mixed with water. But now that im done is there a better cream to help me heal? Im also still having pain and swelling, my breast still feelz so heavey and is sore to touch or even have fabric against and just hurts, im not sure if thats all caused by my radiation or the two surgerys, one in september and one in october.
