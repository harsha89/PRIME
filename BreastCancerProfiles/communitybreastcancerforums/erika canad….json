Because I have fibrocystic breasts, and some \"calcifications\" in the very back of the left breast, right by chest wall was told to have a yearly mammogram and US which I did. In April/06 had the same yearly ritual again. However, felt a lump the size of a big pea (hard) close to the nipple. Told it to the mammo Tech and asked her to tell the Radiologist. I was familiar with the Radiologist (worked for him and Radiological group in that Hospital for years). I stopped in at his office before leaving and asked him if there were any changes in the findings, he assured me there weren't. I, being in a hurry, as was leaving the Country the next day wasn't really concerned as he said it was o.k.  In hindsight, think he may have focused on the calcifications.........and me not discussing the lump with him was my fault, for sure. Tech assured me she discussed it with him, and he truly is an excellent Radiologist took his word for it. Believe  me when I say, I have learned my lesson!!!!! About 6 weeks later, breast hurt and felt somewhat \"warm\" to the touch, me thinking it was a cyst acting up. Returned to Canada approx 6 months later, insisted on a biopsy.... cyst or whatever............. As soon as he was talking about blood pooling as he did an Ultrasound core biopsy; I knew it was bad news. Next morning got a call from my GP to come to the office ASAP; that's when I was told I had IBC. If only I was more persistent, I believe the 6 months would have made a huge difference; perhaps lymph nodes woudn't have been involved. So sorry for prattling so much.....forgive me!! Erika ",

I'm very claustrophobic so didn't have head done.....with the way my memory is now probably should have...sorry, bad joke. I presume he must have seen that area, that's why he said it's only soft tissue swelling, just don't even worry about it. But, if you have been a worrier all your life, don't think I can change; not that I haven't worked hard at it. I guess you are who you are! Here, we don't get our path report. I saw the surgeon once only about a month after, she was running behind schedule and asked me to meet her at the Hospital. She had an entourage of 5 0r 6 interns with her. She said we got it all, clear margins and three positive nodes and she was gone, all in about 2 mins. But, I also know she's the best in this city.....I shouldn't be compaining; that's for sure.

No I didn't have a port because I'm prone to blood clots. I called this morning and will see my onc in 1 week.

I also was sure it was a cyst. I so wish I didn't make this \" self-diagnosis\", I've learned the hard way...........it turned out to be IBC; and I lost so much precious time by not going sooner.  Please, go ASAP for biopsy, it is the only way they can be sure of what it was.
