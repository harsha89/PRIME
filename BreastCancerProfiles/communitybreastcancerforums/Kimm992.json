I had my first taxatore infusion and ended up with really really bad pain so my MO reduced my next two doses by 15%. He says this won't change the effectiveness of the treatment. I'm just wondering if anyone has had a dose reduction and if you were told the same thing? For some reason I can't help but worry that reducing the dose means it won't kill the cancer as well.

The ultrasound results showed 7 concerning spots in my right breast only...3 of them were biopsied and came back positive for IDC (Her2+). The largest tumour is 1.7cm then they all go down in size from there. I just had MRI, CT and Bone Scan and waiting for results. I am concerned that because there are so many spots that the chances that it has traveled to nodes and/or other organs is high. Is it possible to have 7 tumors and still be staged low?? Any insight is so much appreciated! My mind is going crazy waiting!

I met with the oncologist today and he said that he's not able to stage my cancer exactly until they do surgery but that he says it is an \"early\" cancer. All of my scans came back clear. There is just a bit of suspicion about ONE node in my armpit but he says it's not for sure that there is cancer there. Again, we won't know until surgery. He says even if it shows cancer that it's still caught early and he says this is totally curable. I am relieved and ready to start this long journey. Starting chemo next week. Thank you all for the replies and support. No doubt, I will be spending lots of time around here in the coming months",
