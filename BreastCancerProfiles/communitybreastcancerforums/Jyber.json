My oncologist said it was so small some radiologists would not even have mentioned it and it would be followed in a year. It is now one year later and my follow-up CAT showed the lung nodule to be the same size. Lack of growth suggests it is not cancer. The oncologist said we will do one more CAT a year from now and if it still has not grown, then it is assumed benign and we will no longer even do any more follow-ups. So I would assume benign unless you see evidence otherwise (such as growth). Apparently many people are walking around with such things blissfully ignorant - we only learn of ours because of the scans we get.",

He was pushing me to see a plastic surgeon to consider recon but I never even bothered. My reasons are similar to those stated by many above -- my concern was not with losing my breasts but my life. I did not want any surgery that did not work to prolong my life. My self-image is not that based on my looks anyway. I especially did not want anything that might require touch-ups in the future. \"Keep it simple\" was my approach. My surgeon is not used to patients like me and he did a skin-sparing mastectomy telling me that way I would have options in the future if I changed my mind. It is now almost a year later and I have zero desire for reconstruction. If anything, I wish I had considered having a bilateral at the time of the single mastectomy. I do have to admit that since I am NOT thin (have too much belly) the lack of both breasts if I were to go \"flat\" would probably highlight my abdominal excess.   I found out only when getting fitted for my prosthesis that I was a \"C\" cup -- had always been wearing a \"B\" bra! It took breast cancer for me to learn my actual cup size!",
