Over the next two weeks I applied several different creams on it but over the two weeks the rash only got worse, and then I started to experience pain along with the itching. I finally made a doctors appointment, and after the examination  my family doctor said that she thought my breast just has a rash on it, but that she foundt a lump on my left breast (the one that is pink and has a rash on it). When I asked her about the possiblitiy of IBC she said what??? then she said oh yeah ive heard of that and no i dont think it is that. But I am scheduled to get mammogram and an ultrasound on Thursday. Now I am double worried, I have all the symptons of possible IBC and now I have a lump and she put on the mammogram paper, thickening on the left breast and mass. Please help.
