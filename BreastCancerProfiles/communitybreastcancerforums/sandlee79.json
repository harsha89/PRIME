Anyone agree with that?",

Oh you got your hair cut... then soon I'll be wearing the wig which is longer...a little obvious that I will now be wearing the wig.   I know dumb dilemma.  I know the answer is just to shave it off... I have to get over this and just do it... but am having a difficult time.   Just have to get used to this big CHANGE.",
