I didn't count them yesterday, but I think it was between 150-200, comparing to another day when I did count them and it was about 120. On the days I don't wash it is much less. I was hoping too, that a month PFC it would be getting better. I don't have any bald spots or anything like that, but I would prefer if the shedding stopped already or I'll end up with very thin hair. I still wash just twice a week in cold water, still no hot-styling. If I recall correctly, we are supposed to baby our hair for 3-4 months PFC and I will follow this. I'm not dreaming of warm blow drying yet, in fact I hate washing my hair nowadays. BB ",

I don't think it's gobs, but my hair seems to be everywhere. And, no matter how gently I comb it in the morning, I get 50-100 hairs out. On wash days it's about 150. I was wondering if maybe Tamoxifen could be the culprit, too. I'm afraid to wash it more often for the fear of it coming out even more - the hair washing days are my stressful days. I may call my stylist and ask her if she can do the dry cut. That's a good thought - thank you!",

I'm very happy that I used the cold caps and I would recommend them in a heartbeat. However, I am still shedding. I haven't thinned much throughout the chemo, but started shedding more right after finishing Taxol. I have read through this thread from the beginning and I see that some Ladies were shedding up to 16 weeks PFC. This coming Tuesday I will be 16 weeks PFC and I don't want to be the one breaking records when it comes to the shedding. I've never had much hair and I don't have that much more to spare. At this point I wonder if it is still chemo's fault, or maybe Tamoxifen took over on the hair front. I'm itching to go for a long overdue haircut, but I don't dare to go yet because I know when my stylist will comb my wet hair, a lot of it will come out. I'm still hoping the shedding will stop abruptly as some Ladies reported on this thread.",

Each day I'm hoping this is the day that the shedding will abruptly stop, but no such luck yet. Since it's a long time since chemo, I'm not sure if the shedding is still chemo related. Maybe it's a combination of chemo and other factors? I had my thyroid hormones checked by another doctor for unrelated causes and the results were good. I'm still washing my hair in cold water, still every 3-4 days. I'm using the same shampoo and conditioner as I did during chemo. Drying my hair with cold air only and using curling iron on the ends. I need a haircut badly, but I don't dare to go to the stylist yet, because I know she wouldn't be as gentle as I try to be. I'm afraid that half my hair would come out when she combs it wet.",

The eyelashes started to come back quite quickly, right now I'm almost halfway to my usual length. For the eyebrows I had to use a pencil or eyebrow powder to fill them in. After I lost my lashes and brows the first time I was using Latisse. 30-day supply lasted me about 60 days, but I haven't bought any more of it, because it's very expensive. Some women had luck with their insurance companies covering some of the cost, but not me. I think Latisse did help to grow my lashes quicker and longer the first time - something to consider maybe?",
