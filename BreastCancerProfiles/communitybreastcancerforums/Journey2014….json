They have to take out my tissue expander on the left chest (radiated side) and kept the tissue expander on my right breast. Right now I am packing it with silvercel once a day everyday. My plastic surgeon told me that it is better not to saw close it back up because the infection will set in before it will heal, his suggestion is to let it heal on it's own. I know it will take sometime before it looks normal since the wound is deep.",
