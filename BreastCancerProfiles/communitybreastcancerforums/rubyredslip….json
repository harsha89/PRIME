      "Content": "Mar 9, 2010 08:15PM - edited Mar 9, 2010 11:20PM by rubyredslippers HiÂ  Jane I refused Tamoxifen. I was already overweight and very unhappy with my weight when I was diagnosed. I put on around 12kg during Chemo, most of that though was water weight, but I do have a problem with fluid retention anyway. Im one of those people that has no self esteem when overweight and major lack of confidence issues. When Im slim Im a different person. When I finished Chemo and I had no hair, and was the fattest Ive ever been (in the obese range) I was so miserable about how I looked and felt about myself that the thought of taking a drug that would most likely - from everything I'd read and from someone I knew in real life that told me they had never had a weight problem in their life, but gained 30kg on tamoxifen - lead me to either stay that weight, or worse, get bigger was too much to bear after what I'd been thru. I had also read about the other side effects / risks of tamoxifen; the greater risk of getting uterine cancer, the visual problems, headaches, menopause symptoms (I was 38 when I got breast cancer so not already menopausal or even almost there), etc etc. I gave it a lot of thought and decided that at my age, and my situation in life the side effects and risks were not worth it for me. I know that some would say, take it, you may not have experienced the side effects. But I had read a lot about it, and felt that even without the side effects, there's a lot of 'silent' side effects or risks and I just dont like the sound of this drug. I wanted to lose the weight - Im still not there, but I managed to shed around 22kg of it last year, and have around 25kg to get off this year, and I wanted to get back to feeling 'normal' again. The though of spending the next five years of my life with the side effects of tamoxifen just felt to me like some horrible cruel punishment or joke for having gotten breast cancer. My oncologists reacted quite angrily and did all they could to get me to take tamoxifen - to the point of being unprofessional and using scare tactics - I was very positive until they did that, and I had to spend the whole of last year working thru the damage they did to me emotionally. I noted that they did not however attempt at any time to give me all the information to make an informed decision about this drug - I found out about it by doing my own digging - they just told me to take it - well Im sorry, but a drug that is this powerful and potentially life altering warrants women to be given full product disclosure, especially about all the potential risks of taking this drug - my oncologists did not do that. My oncologists reaction to my fears about the increased risk of uterine cancer was an alarmingly flippant, 'well we'd then treat that, or remove your uterus' - as though that would be nothing more that a slight inconvenience. He then went on to angrily say that he'd remove my ovaries as an alternative to tamoxifen - I angrily responded that he would not (Ive never had children and I thought of having my ovaries removed at my age was devastating). Anyway, I finished Chemo November 2008 and I do not regret my decision. I would be happy to discuss this further with you and I hope you make the right decision for YOU about whether to take Tamoxifen.",

Let's move on and pretend nothings happened. I'm depressed and angry. I've been completely traumatized yet, I'm supposed to be \"good\". It just seems like such a stupid thoughtless thing to say.",

I had wigs but hardly wore them as I found they were just too hot at this time of the year. I wore headcarves. I initially bought the pretied ones from headcovers.com. I later abandoned them as I found it much nicer to go and buy my own fabric and wind them around my head and tie - they looked much nicer and I got to wear lovely sequined ones etc and had a different one for every day - much cheaper this way then buying them I found, so you can have colours or patters (in my case some sequinned ones!) that you like and have a wider choice every day. That made me feel better.",
