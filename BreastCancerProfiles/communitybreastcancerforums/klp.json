I didn't notice any tiredness or really anything out of the ordinary. Just got tiring going in each day. I am retired so if I had been working maybe I would have been fatigued..just don't know. I also continued to walk my dog each day and go to Curves 3 times/week. They said, whoever \"they\" is that exercise really helps to prevent fatigue. ",

She said it can come on years later and made it a point to tell me if I fly to wear a compression sleeve. I don't fly so no worry there. She gave me exercises to do while I do rads. That can bring on LE too. In your case I would rather be safe than sorry..you have 2 days to get one. Good luck.",

I also was numb so it was nothing. That was my biggest worry. My only pain was the nurses trying to find a vein for the IV...felt like a pin cushion. I was shopping with my daughters at Walmart the next day..felt fine. Was even better when 2 days later I could take the bandages off and shower. Received the pathology report yesterday..clear margins, 2 nodes negative. I had the \"Sentinel Node Biopsy\" done so I didn't have to go thru the axillary node dissection. I will see my BS next Tues. for post-op and will discuss OncoType DX. The test will determine if I'll need chemo along with radiation and Arimidex. ",

Radiologist came in, l minute later he was finished. Didn't feel a thing. Had to ask if he did it. Valium really does help. Best of luck tomorrow...after the procedure is finished you'll wonder why you wasted your time worrying. (((Hugs))))",
