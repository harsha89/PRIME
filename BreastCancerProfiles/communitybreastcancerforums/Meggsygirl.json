      "Content": "Meggsygirl wrote: hi there, yesterday I went and had a lump checked at my GP and she sent me for urgent U/S and mammogram that same afternoon . The U/S man said he could not see anything suspicious in the area where the lump is but on the mammogram (in that exact spot) there is a white circle (almost perfect shape - very symmetrical). I get my results Tomorrow but I'm just wondering what a white spot might generally mean on a mammo? Of course Dr Google says things like lymph mode and calcification... but I'm just interested to know if anyone has had something similar and it has turned out to be malignant? I am 35. Previously had cervical cancer and hysterectomy and 2 of my aunts have had breast cancer so it's safe to say I'm a little anxious. I know I can't do anything until I get results but I'm also sick of hearing the old 'it will be nothing' from family and friends, I know they're just being positive but I don't want to hear that right now. I want to hear some truths. Anyone who has had similar findings in initial mammo would be so helpful :) I tried to post a pic but it wouldn't let me... Thanks in advance Log in to post a reply",

I'm less concerned about the procedure than I am about waiting until Thursday night for my results... I also have 3 exams over the next 3 days to study for - so it's fair to say I absolutely DO NOT want to be an adult today... Fingers crossed!!",

U/S showed a hemorrhagic cyst in the left breast that I never knew was there... Along with some run of the mill cysts... No mention of this birad score people speak of..? It's looking positive but doc is sending me for further investigation with a specialist to be sure. Has anyone had a hemorrhagic cyst before?",
