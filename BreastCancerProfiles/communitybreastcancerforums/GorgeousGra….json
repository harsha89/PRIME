I know what the procedure does but regardless of a negative or positive result I still do not want rad or chemo...so that being said should I really have that procedure that may or may not have repercussions. ",

I have researched and studied and am very confident in my decision. There are many different ways to treat cancer. I appreciate your advise. I am not making my decisions based on fear but from a position of knowing my treatment path. I wanted the surgery as quickly as possible because my first step was getting the tumor out. What I have decided to do after that is just a different path to treating this cancer. Everyone has to do what is right for them and I know I am doing what is right for me. Again thank you my sister ",

      "Content": "Jun 7, 2014 11:51AM - edited Jun 7, 2014 01:06PM by GorgeousGrandma Hi I am scheduled for surgery this Thursday and wondered if anyone here chose not to do the SNL as part of their surgery. I really have a small area less than 2 cm and the MRI showed no areas of concern. I have already decided not to do the rad and chemo ... so would having the SNL be even necessary. Thank you very much  Editing here...was trying to abbreviate instead of typing it all out but here it goes so I do not confuse no one...Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy...Thanks Mema4",
