I would like to start getting my life back.  First, I know that I need some support because I keep thinking that this disease is going to come back.  My younger sister lost the battle after two rounds of different treatments.  This is a very difficult time of year for me because she died on December 14th right after she had us put up the tree and decorate the house.  I have been wanting to get in the holiday spirit, but I can't get out of my pajama's.  If anyone knows of a group in the area, please let me know.  I can't keep feeling like I do.  I realize that recovery is part mental, and right now I am losing the mental battle.  Lord, give me strength to make it to the end of this long journey Dx 2/13/2004, LCIS, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 1 Log in to post a reply",

I watched my baby sister go through treatment without talking to her children openly about what she was going through.  How old are your children?  I would suggest that you be as open and honest with them as you can.  You will be surprised how supportive and understanding children can be. My sister was 35 when she was first diagnosed.  She decided not to have her breast removed and she had a recurrence less than 5 years later.  She fought hard to hold on to her breast and by doing so allowed the cancer to spread.  If there is a chance that it has taken root, remove your entire breast. When your daughter gets older, make sure she is tested.  Also, you can have the genetic testing done to see if you have the gene ",
