Oncologist told me today that I am stage three...no just three choice so I picked 3a....grade three and triple negative. Bone scan lit on thoracic spine so I need to have an mri and ultrasound showed a spot on my liver that we are going to watch for three months. Had a lumpectomy july 18 with the removal of six nodes. First chemo consult on Friday. They assume that I will have chemo first and then radiation. Is this all really a guess at best....Do the tests and try to come up with the magic potion that is going to give the best chance at survival. Hope they get it right.",

I am canadian and have free health care for major stuff and a really good work plan for prescriptions. I will be referred to a breast health care centre 40 minutes from where I live....biopsy and mri with dye both performed under their umbrella. Lots of questions and I have already made mistakes by not asking full disclosure of pathology report. Will contact family doc tomorrow to get results.",
