I've held it together well up to now,I'm really nervous about chemo starting on Monday the 14th. The first round for 4 sessions will be Adriamycin and Cytoxin. Then after that Taxol for 4 more sessions. Any one out there have any suggestions how NOT to freak out ??? DBowers Log in to post a reply",
