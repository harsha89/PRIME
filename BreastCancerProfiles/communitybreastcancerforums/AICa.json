After mapping, I found out that I could request female techs. The first two weeks, one tech was always the same but the second kept changing. Yesterday, there was a third tech. I asked her to leave. I'm nervous enough with two sets of people handling me. At first I thought she was a trainee, but she was a regular; I asked why she was there and was told that they usually have three techs but the third person on duty at my appt. time has been a man so he has stayed out; yesterday, the third person was a woman so they didn't think I'd mind if she came in. I told her that I did mind - twp people was plenty. How many techs do you all have for your routine rads? Does anyone have three?? Twenty-one years ago, it was routine to remove all nodes. All of mine were negative. I was fortunate to avoid lymphodema, but I have no protection against infection. I have to be extremely careful on that side. For example, yesterday, I scratched my finger on a partially open staple and this morning it was infected. So with partial node dissection, things have gotten better. ",

After my regular treatment, my Rad Onc came in and drew a big circle on my breast sort of around the scar. After he left, the tech reinforced the mark with another pen. Then she attached a piece of equipment to the machine and warned me that it would come close to me but not touch me. This attachment seemed to be a frame with a glass center. She looked through the glass and drew on it, copying the circle on my breast onto the glass. They're going to create a piece of metal with that exact opening so that only that area will be radiated. They talk about all the precise calculations involved in rads; but when the Rad Onc was drawing on me, it seemed very casual - not precise. Before I left, the tech put a bunch of tegaderm patches (small, circular clear adhesive bandages) on the markings to make them last, since I declined to be tattooed. ",

I went in 20 minutes early so I could say goodbye to the only person I liked - a tech - D - who was reassigned 10 days ago. I asked for D at reception and sat down to wait. Then the receptionist called me up and told me to go back and change and I could talk to D after my treatment. I said NO, I wanted to talk to her my street clothes, not a gown; I'd come in early to see her, my appointment wasn't until 2:30, and I wasn't going in until then. She said okay, and I sat down. Then the tech I don't like came out to the lobby and told me to go back and change into a gown, etc. I told her I would not, I'd come in early, I wanted to see D first, etc. A few minutes later, D came out. Her smile just lights up the room.I gave her a card that included a note where I'd mentioned her kind actions and how much I had appreciated them as well as her always welcoming smile; and it included a gift card. And, as I told her, I wrote to the dept. manager to praise her actions. I also gave D a letter I'd written about my experiences and how I would like to have been treated; I told her that she was the only one who listened to me and treated me like a person, and hoped that by giving her this information it would get to others.  At 2:30, I went for my final treatment. I had been told I'd be seeing the nurse then the Dr. The tech I didn't like led me out of the room and told me she'd walk me over to the exam room. As I had rehearsed many times in my head, I told her that I'd told them many times that I didn't want to see a nurse, and I wasn't going to see a nurse today. Also, since I was finished with treatment, i wasn't going to see the Dr. today. I was leaving. And I thanked her, and I left. It felt glorious. ",

My Mother died of breast cancer; one sister had breast cancer and the other died of ovarian cancer. I had breast cancer over 20 years ago and now have a different cancer in the other breast. I had chemo and radiation together then (chemo for 6 months), and I worked because I had to (single with children). My breast returned to almost normal after treatment, although smaller than the other - perhaps because the rest of me gained weight over the years. I'm a private person but have strong personal preferences. I had a number of unpleasant experiences then. This time, I'm speaking up for myself. For one, I said no tattoos. During mapping, I felt pain and found out the tech was tattooing me. I got off of the table. I was shown photographs of people with tattoos in an effort to convince me, but I refused. I later had my dermatologist remove the 2 marks, and the hospital paid the bill. During treatment, I learned I had been photographed when I was unconscious; I saw the Polariods in my file, reclaimed them, and destroyed them. I am modest and am usually quiet, but I am adamant about speaking up for myself this time. All of my doctors are women, except the radiation oncologist - couldn't find a woman. On the day of my recent mapping, my name was called by a young man who said he was a student intern and would be with me for my procedure. In a non-confrontational manner, I asked whether I had a choice; I did, and I told the techs I wanted him to leave - nothing personal; they said he was used to it. The techs, a man and woman, were middle-aged and kind. Crying, I told them about some of my many unpleasant experiences during my previous cancer experience. I said didn't want to be tattooed, and they were fine and comforting. When the tech told me she was going to photograph my face (with a digital camera) I asked if I had a choice; we discussed it and I said no photographs. Then she told me that she was going to photograph my breast after marking; I asked if I had a choice; we discussed it and I said no photographs. By the time I lay down on the table, I was shaking but glad I had spoken up. After the session, the woman tech asked how it had gone for me; I told her that I prefer women staff; I found out I have a choice. The day of the simulation, a week later, I started to shake as soon as my name was called. I explained that I didn't want to be tattooed and that I wanted to see only women, and they already knew. But I have been crying a lot. I don't know whether it's anxiety, adrenalin, or simply exhaustion.",

I phoned from another parking lot and told them I'd come back or wait but I wouldn't go in while she was there. A tech called me back shortly and said she'd left; she'd finished treatment that morning and was dropping off cookies. I have aloe plants in my garden. After treatment, I sliced one and slide it around my breast; it dried pretty quickly. Is that how I'm supposed to apply it? How often?",

But if your Dr. can't do anything to fix it, he may dismiss it.  I have a personal prejudice against male doctors, finding them generally without empathy. Unfortunately, all 4 Rad Oncs at my medical center are male; but all my other doctors are women. I've never heard a woman Dr. say, \"You'll get used to it,\" like my Rad Onc did. Just my opinion.",

I asked a lot of questions and got few answers. He said it could be a different type of ray; could be from a different direction, different length and intensity. They (I presume he and the physicist) will work that out after the marking. Does anyone have details? I didn't even know there were different kinds of rays (from the same machine).",
