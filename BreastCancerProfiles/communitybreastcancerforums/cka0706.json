Yesterday I went to the onc for the first time (already had the bilat mx last month) and my oncotype was high so I'll be joining the chemo clup. After the surgery the SNB came back clear so I thought I was off the hook. Not so lucky. I decided that knowing the oncotype score and being able to hopefully bypass a recurrence is a good thing. But I'm seriously dreading the whole chemo thing. I hate the idea of losing my hair and I only realized yesterday this doesn't mean just the hair on my head (duh!). Eyebrows and eyelashes, too. My first session is December 1 so I think I will start a new \"starting chemo in December\" thread. Good luck to my fellow warriors out there. I'm thinking of you and relying on your strength and humor.",

First -- should I bring some food with me. I was told the infusion takes 2-1/2 to 3 hours. I know I'll get hungry during that time but not sure what to bring (other than saltines, which I really don't like). Any ideas? Second -- is anyone else allowed in the treatment room with you? My dear friend offered to stay with me and I loved the idea. (Some people I wouldn't allow in the treatment room ever - too negative!).  Would love your thoughts on this. Carolyn",

They are keeping a roster of all the December chemo sisters at the top of it. Check it out. I just posted on it so it should be \"bumped\" and easy for you to find.

I fell asleep after the first hour but she was smart enough to bring her laptop and work while I snoozed. We went out to lunch afterwards. It's good to have such caring friends. Chemo brain hit hard and fast. I couldn't remember some pretty routine stuff and I can't type at all anymore. Plus I'm so hyper from the steroids. Weird. I got a Neulasta shot today (hurt like crazy) and I'm not looking forward to bone pain, but I've had 2 nasty infections this year that landed me in the hospital so the onc isn't taking any chances.  My biggest accomplishment today is buying a wig. I put that off because I didn't want to think about losing my hair. I think next week I'll get a short cut (my hair is shoulder length). I asked my 25-year-old son if he wants to give me the buzz cut when I'm ready for it. I told him the decision was his but he thought that was pretty cool. I love the tips and I re-read them now that they're more specific to my needs. So thanks for sharing them! I definitely want to find the Gin-gin drops at Whole Foods. Dry mouth is a problem. Good wishes to my chemo sisters! Carolyn",

The best advice I got is that it's a combination of \"auto-pilot\" and \"adrenaline\". I agree with that. And everyone has their own time and own way of grieving, you just have to be patient with yourself.  You're right that it's very hard to worry family and friends. Their sadness is hard to handle but I realized it's because they really care about me, which is truly wonderful! Don't be afraid to tell you family and friends what you can and cannot hear. In other words, if someone starts telling you something you don't want to hear -- even if it's just a difficult day and you don't want to talk -- tell them. I was terrible about saying this sort of thing but quickly learned I needed to do that. There were days when talking just exhausted me. If someone called, I thanked them for calling and said it was too tiring to talk that day and I hope they understood. They did and they are true friends. So this is the time to let family and friends be there for you. Amazingly, letting them do things really helps them ... things like bringing dinner, sending cards or magazines, dropping off flowers make them feel good and really perked me up.  Good luck with you surgery. I will be thinking of you. Let us know how everything turns out. Carolyn",
