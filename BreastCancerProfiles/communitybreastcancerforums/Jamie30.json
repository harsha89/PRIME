That worries me a bit.  How would I know if they drop too much?",

Its great that you didnt get the acne also.  I had zits the next morning after my chemo.  I was always lucky and never had to worry about acne and here I am 30 years old and dealing with it, lol.  I feel like a teenager and now I understand the pain, lol.",

I noticed last week that I had a red area where the iv was for my FIRST treatment, it didnt pop up until right after my second treatment. It didnt hurt but was really red.  Now it looks like an old bruise and the skin has peeled arund it.   Now I have a RED patch about the size of a quarter where my iv was for my second treatment.  This one feels a little warm and is a little sore if I poke it.  Has anyone experienced this.  It doesnt bother me other than being a little bothersome to be polka dotted.",
