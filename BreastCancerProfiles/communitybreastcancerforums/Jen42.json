I am over one year out from BMX and immediate recon and doing great. But I kept notes of my progress after surgery, so I looked up what I wrote in the weeks right after. It looks like I was having chest pain for close to a month. Could only sleep on my back that entire time and it was really frustrating and caused it's own problems (butt falling asleep, heels hurting intensely from pressure of being in one position, really did not sleep much -- more like napping off / on thru day and night). I know women who were given muscle relaxants seemed to do much better with not having so much chest pain. I wish I had thought to ask my surgeon about that. Next time ! (Ha -- that is a bad joke -- a little black humor...) My notes show that once pain started to improve, fatigue was a HUGE issue for a long time. Just a heads up. Once you are feeling better, don't get frustrated with all the fatigue -- and definitely don't try to do too much too soon ! A lot of women make that mistake and really pay for it. I feel very lucky that everything went smoothly from surgery thru recovery and I went back to my job as a Fed Ex courier, routinely lifting heavy stuff and being very active after 10 weeks. (Although fatigue did rear it's head again at first and I had a lot of weekends where I just slept.) A note to Omeggo, who will have surgery next month...as Blessings noted in her post...it's really important to stay AHEAD of the pain. Don't try to be a hero or be afraid of the meds. DO take a stool softener, though ! You can end up with a whole other source of pain, needlessly. I was told that my body will heal faster if it is not burning up energy being in pain (well, it was put to me more scientifically than that, but you get the idea). But I just want to repeat what I wrote at beginning of this post -- over a year out and doing really well ! Hang in there ! - Jen",

Every time I pushed the button, 15 min later I was vomiting. It was a nightmare. Finally at 3am I said I need something else. All they could give me was Tylenol until my surgeon came to see me at 8am. Tylenol was not enough for the pain but at least I wasn't vomiting anymore. Surgeon switched me to Norco which did better on the pain, and didn't make me sick. I continued to use Norco for about a week and then switched to Tylenol. Everyone is different, but that was my experience with meds.",

Different sizes and shapes. When in bed, I had to sleep really propped up -- basically almost a sitting position for first couple of weeks. So giant pillows worked good for behind me. Little ones for under my arms. As time went on, I removed some of the pillows...I also brought a small, thin pillow with me to hospital, for the drive home. I put it between my chest and the seatbelt. Highly recommend this, it got me home with minimal pain.",

But the details do get a bit hazy as time goes by. The women at the support group who told me their experiences (I went to two meetings after I was diagnosed, before I had made any decisions, it was incredibly helpful and lessened my fear) were all around 3 years out from their BMX surgery. And they said it was hard to remember all the details. I never thought I would be saying same thing just a year later! Keeping notes is helpful -- it helped me process what I was going thru at the time, and now allows me to help others -- I also took before and after photos (no face, just close up of my chest area). I'm glad I did that, and I have shown them to one other woman so far who was facing recon decisions...",

I do not have children, so did not have the added mental anguish of that to deal with. But any cancer diagnosis is hard to cope with and it's an emotional rollercoaster. I felt betrayed by my body, and I felt \"why me?\", I felt overwhelmed, oh just every emotion out there. Except I never felt that it was a death sentence. When my surgeon told me I had DCIS, the first thing he did was reassure me that it is very early stage and, with treatment, pretty much 100% curable. But to do nothing was not an option, as things could change for the worse down the road. So then I went into research mode and that helped calm me down, feel more in control. Met with all the doctors (breast surgeon, oncologist, radiation oncologist, plastic surgeon) to find out all my options and to try to figure out what would be best for ME. There were still times I broke down and cried and told my husband, \"I don't want to do ANY of this ! Why is this happening?\" but I think that is a normal reaction. I am now 8 weeks post surgery and the pain, the anguish, all the really tough stuff is behind me and fading from my memory. I am getting used to my \"new normal\" of having implants. But I feel so lucky my cancer was caught early...and that's what you should remember, too...you DID have that mammogram (\"early detection saves lives!\", pass it on!) and now you can take care of this before it gets worse.

I really liked and trusted both the breast surgeon and plastic surgeon I was referred to. Then when I went to a local support group, three women there had used same team of doctors and were very happy with outcomes. My gut feeling was correct:  my surgery went very well, my recon looks good, and I have had no complications at all. I so wish the same for you !! It does feel like a drastic decision but I kept reminding myself it would mean I shouldn't have to worry about breast cancer again. (Nothing is 100%, of course, but my doctors were very reassuring to me that I now have as close to a 0% chance of recurrence as possible.) With your surgery date in Sept, does this mean you will still do the triathlon on July 30? I hope you do it ... I would think the event would have new meaning for you now:  a chance to push your body physically, to complete a goal, to show yourself you are strong and can do what it takes to get what you want, whether that means completing a triathlon or beating breast cancer ! Good luck !!",
