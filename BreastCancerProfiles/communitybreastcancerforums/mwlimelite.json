Side note: he was a little bit of a dick... made me feel a bit like I was wasting his time. Well maybe I was but I'd rather be safe than sorry!! My regular female RO would have been a lot more empathetic.",

I haven't felt a huge hit of fatigue yet (I'm at 13/20) but that's not to say I haven't felt tired and worn out by the end of the day, since I haven't stopped doing anything else I would normally be doing, and things are ramped up even more than usual these days. When it rains it pours. That said, I have been a lot more physically active than normal during these period of time. Who knows, maybe that helps. I've been walking between the hospital and my office every day and in total I get at least 1-1.5 hours of active time in a day during the week. I'm so grateful that I'm close enough to walk, and also that I'm not having to do this during the winter because I think this would suck so much extra if I had to deal with snowstorms and the corresponding hassle too. Brave - I'm shocked to hear they don't wash the gowns after each use at your hospital! What is up with that?! Glad to hear you've found a solution though! XOXOXO to everyone, hang in there, before you know it this will all be a blurry memory. #STAYSTRONG",

      "Content": "Nov 5, 2018 02:19PM - edited Nov 6, 2018 08:30PM by mwlimelite Thank you, Frog! How cool that we are all here bonding across continents, thanks to the magic of the interwebs. I am officially done! I got a diploma and lots of hugs. :) I brought in a thank you card and gift basket full of \"healthy\" chocolate and treats for my team to thank them for taking such good care of me. I will not miss going in there every day, even though I will miss seeing those ladies. SE-wise, I can't complain. Since the boosts started last week, my breast is starting to feel squishy again instead of firm like it was for a while with the swelling that I had. I've been doing the wing exercises and stretches which feels like it's helping. It'll be interesting to see once the swelling goes down, if it gets even smaller like they say can happen with rads.I will echo what Spoonie said about the compression. I had to start wearing a sports bra again soon after starting rads, due to swelling and it seems like this kept it in check. I do still have pain zingers and shivers (with cold temps) now and then, from surgery which I know will take a while to resolve. My skin is a little bit tan but not red, a little itchy but manageable. THANK YOU \"MY GIRLS\" CREAM!!! The only irritated part is the skin on my nipple that has been finely peeling little by little. I also have the \"freckly\" look which is confirmed to be zapped hair follicles. Funny, the only place I didn't apply the cream was in the armpit, which is definitely drier and much darker, more affected by the whole experience. I didn't know the armpit would be affected so I didn't lube up that far! LOL This afternoon I see my MO again for more details on the next phase.... Tamoxifen. Best wishes to all my October rads sisters! Stay positive and keep your eye on the prize! Today during my last session I pictured myself with my husband, both of us healthy at some ripe old age.

      "Content": "Oct 16, 2018 03:42PM - edited Oct 17, 2018 08:11AM by mwlimelite Welcome Dreamers, First, bless you if 1989 refers to your birth year and you are here with us at such a young age. I've had phantom pains now and again since my lumpectomy. It's pretty normal and I believe it has to do with nerves re-connecting after surgery and is most likely nothing to worry about. That said, you should mention it to your RO anyway during your weekly visit - do not hesitate to ask about anything. They should be very accommodating. In the first month after my surgery, as soon as I stepped into a cold room I would get what I describe as \"shiver pains\" where I would get a shivering sensation throughout my affected breast but only the breast. Very strange. Still happens, just not as often. And now after 6 days of radiation I am suffering from what I call \"Angry Boob Syndrome\" (ABS) which is how I describe the backup of fluid inside my breast (seroma I believe) that appeared about 2 weeks after surgery, went down and has now re-surfaced with a vengeance since day 3 of RT. It's swollen, hard, and sore, and there is a lump right underneath my incision site that moves and gets larger as the day wears on and smaller when I sleep. My RO was kind enough to show me my CT scan pics so I could see how much fluid is in there. Nothing I can do except exercises to get the fluid to move on through. The nurse told me that they could drain it, but draining sometimes leaves even more of a cavity so I'm hoping to avoid that route unless absolutely necessary. BTW - my \"ABS\" isn't a side effect of RT but rather from the surgery itself, but for some reason RT triggered its return. Fun times! Also, I wanted to share with the group that I have been using the My Girls skin cream - haven't seen anyone post about that. It's luxurious and smells great. It's one of the approved creams on my list. I also have Miaderm bar soap for showering. And only natural deodorants. I tossed my old ones in the trash as soon as I started reading about the aluminum content. I'm still on the hunt for the perfect one but Schmidt's Rose and Vanilla serves well enough for now. I wish I could get music! But we have to make sure I can hear them tell me when to \"breathe in and hold.\" Sigh. Gentle hugs to all! Do something nice for yourselves tonight ladies. You deserve it.

My soreness and swelling seems to come and go, getting better than suddenly getting a little worse again for no apparent reason. Nothing like it was during rads though, thankfully. My pecs and upper ab on that side (right below the breast) are very very tight. I try and do stretches every day to loosen them up, but if I miss even one day, it gets tight again. GRR. My RO said that the muscles get tight from rads, but I might also have some lingering cording from surgery, so I guess it's just a matter of keeping up with the stretches and hopefully eventually things will get back to normal. When I had my surgery follow up on 12/17, the nurse said that this is all normal and will go away with time, and recommended heat so I use a heating pad every night. PT will definitely help! I'm kind of scared to jinx it, but I've been on Tamoxifen since 11/23 and have had no side effects whatsoever, except possibly a missed period (which was not a bad thing!).

I had another round of CT imaging done today so they can keep up with any changes that have occurred since my original scan - and I also have a lot of swelling, so I'm really glad they had this on the calendar. My husband is growing a solidarity beard while I'm in RT. I was in tears when he told me that's why he hasn't shaved... I can't believe I didn't put two and two together!! DUH.

I wouldn't be surprised if we are maybe a bit immune suppressed at the moment, even though that isn't an officially recognized SE. It's cold season so there are sick people all around us - and don't forget we are in a hospital every day. I have also been struggling with allergy-like sneezing fits off and on, even though I NEVER have any reaction to my furry allergens at home (cats). Don't freak yourself out! Hang in there until you can talk to your RO and just relax over the weekend. Meditate, do yoga, get a massage or pedicure... whatever works for you. Enjoy your days off and get lots of rest!

I was diagnosed 7/24 at age 42 on my first ever mammogram. Stage 1 IDC, DCIS, and low grade. My lumpectomy was on 9/4, clean margins, no lymph node involvement, and I have been healing very well. I was feeling very lucky all things considered but this radiation experience is messing me up! Today was my third day of radiation and it sure as hell is a mind trip. Anyone else feel insecure about being exposed when the therapists leave you alone in there with no protection over the rest of your body? I stress about the breath holds too, but I'm trying to meditate and visualize the machine HEALING me... Anyhow, I came to this forum because I was feeling more soreness today, then I came home after work to find that my affected breast has become swollen, hard, heavy and sore. Skin is OK, maybe a little pink but not burned yet. Before rads started I was almost entirely out of the pain zone and now I'm way back in after only 3 days. Trying to figure out if this is a normal SE of rads... They said it might shrink the breast, but there is not much literature out there about swelling. So I'm grateful to Spoonie for sharing your experience! The tissue underneath and around the incision is hardened as well ugh. I had two biopsies there too. I was doing so well & it really feels like I've gone backwards which is depressing - and I've had a very positive outlook all throughout up until now. Tomorrow after my session I'm going to bring attention to it and also visit the nurse I've been working with from the beginning to have her look at it. Stay strong ladies! It's nice to have a place to share experiences. Michelle in Boston",

I was just wondering today if I would get some kind of certificate LOL. Spoonie, good for you! Hubby plans to take me out for a nice dinner Monday night to celebrate. I saw my RO for the last time yesterday and she gave me discharge instructions. A lot of what's been mentioned here already. She also said I should continue to stretch my pectorals and raise my arm over my head to stretch the muscle below my breast, which can get tight from rads. She warned me that some women feel a bit adrift not doing something active to fight the cancer, or increased fatigue as kind of a \"let down\" of adrenaline like after you complete a big project. I feel like that will NOT be the case but I suppose, you never know! I'll also share the 2 resources that she recommended for helping to manage mood/stress/depression without drugs and tips for a healthy lifestyle going forward: http://tlc.ku.edu (the Ted talk on the homepage is quite enlightening) https://www.amazon.com/Anticancer-David-Servan-Schreiber-MD-PhD/dp/0452295726/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr= I won't see RO again until January of 2020. I'll see the various doctors in 3 month alternating intervals and she's last. Which makes me sad, because she's my favorite. I was surprised to hear that I won't be getting another mammogram until July, one year after my diagnosis. I'll take this as a good thing! ",

Every little bit of humor helps! I will be joining you and RiRi in the Tamoxifen club at some point after my rads end and I meet again with my MO on Nov. 5 (both on the same day). I am really nervous about the SEs as well and I sincerely hope I will get a couple of weeks break first, but I'll do whatever I'm told. Last night on the phone with my mother (who has made it to 85 never having had cancer of any kind and is very anti-pharma) she says \"I wish you wouldn't go on medication.\" UGH. I tried to explain how I need to make sure I NEVER have to go through this again.... I get where she's coming from but she cannot comprehend the mental strain this disease puts us through, how the knowledge that you had a life-threatening disease that could come back at any point changes your entire outlook on everything. I would do anything to increase my chances of staying cancer free until my deathbed. I do believe in incorporating holistic approaches, diet, exercise, meditation, etc. but not at the exclusion of research-backed medical science. I know some women opt out of things like RT and drugs, and god bless those of you out there with the courage to do that. But I personally don't feel that I have that much strength! And with all that said, we'll see how I tolerate the drug! I have a colleague who had a really hard time with Tamoxifen and stopped taking it after 3 years... she's 11 years cancer-free and has never looked back. Looking forward to the weekend! Hugs to all of you warrior women!!",

Since my appointment is first thing in the morning, it's not an issue because I shower and just go without putting any cream or deodorant on, then I slather on the cream right after tx and about 2-3 more times throughout the day. The nurse said that if my treatments were in the afternoon, it would be OK to put the cream on in the morning because it would be worn off by the time I got to tx. Ask your nurse what they recommend based on the time of your treatment and whatever else you're doing throughout the day. Had my first boost today and no more goggles - I don't have to hold my breath for these so I can just zone out. 3 zaps, about 10 seconds each from different angles. I have 4 more txs to go and I AM SO READY. Anyone else getting freckly? I have olive skin and have never gotten freckles from sunburn but I am getting a ring of 'em right now around my nipple. lol Also starting to feel itchy off and on. Can't complain!!! Hugs to all my October rads sisters!",
