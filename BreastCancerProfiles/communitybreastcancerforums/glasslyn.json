This is my first time on.  I am seeing a PS in less than a half hour.  Already had one mastectomy, will be having my second.  Debating reconstruction, but leaning more toward not doing it.  Had a pair of 32DD's.  It was weird being lopsided, although prostetics take care of that nicely.  Some part of me is actually relieved to have the opportunity to be even again, although \"even\" will mean being flat.  I know a lot of people have had great results with reconstruction, but like many of you, I fear the added complications that come with reconstruction.  Sure, it would be nice to look good in clothes, but I have a couple of friends that are eager to help me with dressing \"flat\".  Mostly, I'm tired of having to make so many huge decisions as a result of this disease. Unless this PS can guarantee me fabulous results with no issues (which is probably not going to happen), I think I'll be basing my decision on health and not appearances.  Thanks to all you ladies who wrote of their experiences, you have helped me immensely.  Doctors are our saviors, but they rarely have the actual first-hand experience of their treatments.  Reading your accounts has given me the strength and conviction to listen to my own voice.",
