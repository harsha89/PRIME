They will put gooey gel on your breast and then use the ultrasound wand to find the spot that needs to be biopsied. Then they will inject some lidocaine into the spot so that you won't feel the actual biopsy (this is the only part that hurts, the needle prick and then the sting from the medication going in). They will then use a bigger needle to go in and get the biopsy sample. I suggest not looking if you aren't very comfortable with needles. Also, if you are really worried ask your Dr. to give you a sedative pill (Xanax or something) beforehand. You will probably have to arrange that today if you want it and you will have to have somebody drive you if you take it. They will put some steri-strip bandages and some gauze over it and you are good to go. It might bleed a little for a day or two then the strips will fall off and you won't even be able to see the mark. Good luck and I hope your results come back benign!",

I just had an MRI Tues evening and I got the results Thurs morning. I know it's hard not to panic and my first instinct was also to hurry up and get it out. But remember that it's been there a long time so a few days/weeks to make decisions and get a thorough diagnosis is okay. My original mass was almost 3 cm and I could see it in the contour of my breast. In the end I did chemo first and the mass shrunk and I was able to have a lumpectomy that didn't distort the shape of my breast. That was 5 years ago :) I hope that your treatment goes smoothly and that you get your MRI results quickly...I do think waiting and uncertainty is the hardest part.",

I think you definitely should go have your breast checked. Pregnancy is a tricky time for our bodies. There are breast changes that are natural during and after pregnancy that can result in lumps, but the estrogen in our bodies is very high during pregnancy which can make it a time for cancer cells to grow. I was actually diagnosed during my pregnancy and I'm so glad that my Dr. didn't brush me off because of pregnancy related breast changes. It's much more likely that it's something besides cancer but I think it's smart to go get checked. If it is an infection or something then your Dr. can treat that and you will feel better. Good luck!",

I was diagnosed when I was pregnant with my first child and was 34. Hopefully this won't be the case for you. My understanding is that anything that needs to be biopsied is given a BI-RADS4 rating and that many if not most of these biopsies come back ok. I'm actually waiting for biopsy results now on a BI-RADS4 mass in my other breast. The estrogen surge from the pregnancy causes all kinds of changes in the breasts, occasionally cancer but often other insignificant things. Good for you for getting checked so quickly to make sure you are ok! My best advise is to try to distract yourself and not worry so very much until you get results back. I know, it is easier said than done! Ultimately, people (including me) can go through treatment while pregnant and come out just fine. I am healthy now, 5 years later, and my beautiful 5 year old daughter is next to me now watching cartoons. Take care of yourself and I will hope for good results for you. If you have any specific questions or want to chat please send me a message! Hugs.",
