I had no problem replying \"how would you feel\" (if they had BC). I had some friends before DX, but they quickly dropped contact with me after DX and I've never looked back. They weren't worth the effort and weren't what I'd call genuine. I understand depression all too well. Am coming up on one year since my husband died on Christmas Day from lung cancer. I'm still trying to find my balance but thankfully, my daughter and little grandson moved in with me and have been a great comfort. Sometimes even my best friends make me sad when they want to keep telling me they're worried about me. But usually they're referring to my depression and not the possibility of a recurrence. Remember to stay clear of the ones that tell you about someone near to them that has passed away from cancer or, a great response would be \"I'm sorry you've lost them -- how does this make me feel better\"? Merry Xmas all ! Shelly",

The difference is the team of docs saw me as Stage 1 or 2a at the most but without lymph node involvement. I've learned not to rely on the PET or MRI much, as did those prior to double mast surgery and nothing showed positive, and actually the tumor showed to be less than 1/2 what the actual size was after surgery !! So jump-shoot me into Stage 3 after that. I knew I didn't want implants because of all the negative data and having to replace after 7-10 years, so opted for the DIEP. Had to travel out of state to a plastic surgeon trained for the diep. This was a major surgery and I was under anesthesia for 11 hours. I was lucky that I didn't have complications, but my end result after 2 revisions is not entirely satisfactory. I had less than 2 mm of skin layer on the radiated side and a good 1/2 inch thickness on the other side, which poses a problem or two like having less tissue to work with, etc. My PS did a good job, with what was there to work with. I put off reconstruction for almost 2 years after surgery, although the surgeon suggested at least 6 months. This gave me time to research all options using my own tissue such as the IGAP, Tug SGAP & DIEP. As far as your story, I would do what your gut tells you. For me it was an easy choice to have double MX. I have several relatives that have fought BC. Sbelizabeth: I too have a binder or two which came in very handy when my PS wanted copies of my bilat mast surgery. And recently now have changed health care plans due to husband retiring and losing the employer plan. So now have put all my records on CD for the new onc. Did your PS have to take a vein from another part of your body , i.e., sowewhere in the leg? This I was told may have to happen if a vein in the chest was not viable or too small. It was amazing I didn't have more complications other than my arteries kept hiding (as he put it - made it a game of hide & seek). Be well everybody! shelly ",

As I am pondering getting the testing because of second degree relatives with BC on both my parents' sides, this is AWESOME. Even with my current insurance coverage, I would have to meet the $2500 deductible so not real affordable. My genetics doc would write the order for it.
