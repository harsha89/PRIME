They are still doing pathology so that\u2019s all I know. But I\u2019ve had 35 years to prepare, and thought I was. My mother was diagnosed the 1st time when I was 20 and that\u2019s when I had my first mammogram. My latest mammogram in October revealed a difference from the year before and when I saw the mammogram, I was pretty sure it was cancer. I\u2019m handling it pretty well and I have told people because I need their prayers and support. It is scary but it is not necessarily a death sentence. My mother is a 35 year and 16 year survivor. My best friend is a 5 year survivor. We can do this.",

Even if it is cancer, it doesn\u2019t mean your life is over. My mother is a 2 time, 35 year survivor. You are strong. You can get through this",
