I don't have my exact January start date yet however, I've just been trying to get through all the material and appts over the last 2 weeks.  Things are moving quickly in this BC world.  My PET scan and meeting my oncologist is scheduled for Thurs. Dec. 30th.  I'm starting with Chemo since a positive lymphnode was biopsied, then surgery, likely Mx since an MRI picked up on another tumor located in a diff. quadrant, then radiation. Seems we have a chance to see if the tumor is responding during  chemo but I still think that leads to Mx if in a different quad. Still waiting on the Herc2 results, it was borderline and sent to another lab for additional testing.   I'm hoping to connect with this special group as we carry each other through our steps to recovery.   ",

I received my Gaila today. It's really pretty and it arrived in about 3 days with a very nice handwritten note.  I had a bad experience while being fitted for a wig this week. The woman was so negative and unprofessional, couldn't wait to exit her shop.  It really gave me a sinking feeling. She complained that my hair was too thick to get a measurement and suggested I wait until it falls out to come back and see her. That kinda defeats the purpose.   And to think she came highly recommended, I'm surprised.   Needless to say, I didn't order any, however I found some really cute styles at headcovers.com that I am considering. Sending good vibes out to everyone and thanks for sharing, I've soaked up so much info and it really has made a difference. Kim",

If you knew me, it sounds funny to pull the C card, so they might just do it !! I've been battling an infection and cellulitis in my left breast this week. I woke to some pain, Thought I slept on my stomach with a rumpled blanket under me. But must have been an infection and got worse when my counts were down. Currently taking an antibiotic and heat compress. Those ThemaCare heat wraps are the bomb, a good alt. to a hot compress. Hope everyone is doing well. Will have to review my notes to see who's starting next week.",

Thinking of you. tide knot - much luck with the port surgery today, you'll be glad you have it when you begin your treatment on Friday. Getting the port was when things started to shift to a reality for me. My hairdresser returns from a Vegas hair show this week. I've decided to go short, even though it may only be for a few days. I told her to keep an eye out for a sassy style. My DH will take me there after my Nuelasta shot on Saturday, I'll have her trim the wig if needed at that time too. Maybe even do my makeup and then we'll head to lunch. I thought I'd make it more of an event and something to look forward to than something that I have to do. When it comes to shaving it all off, I've asked her to come to my home so it's a bit more private. Sending hugs and good thoughts out to everyone today. I'm really enjoying this community of sharing info and support for everyone. Kim",

      "Content": "Jan 30, 2011 06:24AM - edited Jan 30, 2011 06:25AM by Kym61 Hi everyone, it's been about a week since I did an update, a time to catch up to this very active thread with so many 'lovelies' all in various stages of treatment. I have two AC treatments of four done. I went to work on Friday, 1 week after #2, I felt good enough to return on Wed. But held off due to the snow since it's almost a 30 mile drive. Anyway, I felt like a rock star at work, lots of energy and a good vibe back from everyone. I consider myself one of the lucky ones, my SE's have been very minimal, no nausea, (i get decadron, zophran and emend at infusion) plus i have compazine and zophran and emend for breakthrough) and take very little, only tired after the Nuelasta shot for 2-3 days, no residual pain from the shot. I take Clariten 1 hour prior to the shot and for the next two days. If the AC fatigue is cumulative, it hasn't caught up with me yet. I must say that I don't have kids or pets so I do a lot of lounging around and that might be helping. It also makes me think I've been a slug, so I did venture out to shop Yesterday and did 30 min. at the gym on the treadmill. My work is 100% behind me, they said they owe it to me for the past nine years of service, totally surprised me. So without the added pressure of a work and travel schedule, mentally I've been at peace to fight this. I have been checking in with my production team to give some guidance though. I don't know much about Taxol and begin that in March I'm a little weirded out because I'm now spoiled with the good results so far that I'm fearing what might happen on Taxol. maybe someone can share a thread they have seen on Taxol. For those of you on an iPad, when you preview, you can add a bunch of returns that will advance the text upward, then delete the returns and it will pull the hidden text at the bottom up into the screen to view. Now if I could only upload a picture! I wish there was a morsel of info that I could share so that others wouldn't have to suffer as much, I would gladly take some of your pain if I knew it would would ease some of your SE's. On day 15 my hair began to come out, I did get a sassy short cut last Sat. But by Tues. Day 19 it came out by the handful, just touching it so I got it buzzed off the same day by my long time friend and hairdresser. I took my mom and it was more painful to her, and when I asked if she was okay, that's all it took and she teared up. I assured her it was fine, they all marveled at the shape of my head, I guess they approved, it was a bit comical and really much easier than I had imagined it would be. all the earlier wigging out was just the unknown creeping in. As for my wig, I'm very happy with her 'I call her Ginger' since there are brown and red highlights throughout and you'd never know it's a wig. I'll catch up with personals when I get my laptop back from an upgrade. The \"N\" bars sound wonderful and similar to a 'mounds bar' recipe that I have. My appetite has been healthy, I could certainly stand to eat more fruits and veggies, something I'll strive to work on. Good thoughts are going out to everyone and to those who have treatment again this week, may you all escape SE's.",

I feel very fortunate, and thanks in part to everything I'm learning from all of you. welcome Amara, what a pretty name.

I fell asleep for about 30 minutes during the infusion but felt well enough to have lunch at The Olive Garden when I was done. Didn't even need my usual afternoon nap as I did with AC. No rashes thus far, and no more Nuelasta shots with Taxol. I had my first consultation with the BS, it was a bit too soon for me. I must be feeling better because I was getting irritated, the BS went on and on about a procedure that she doesn't even perform. Needless to say, I will be exploring my options with several opinions before making a decision. Also awaiting the results of the genetic test. I felt fairly normal last week and entered a chile cook off at the local 'fire and ice' event, and wound up getting 2nd place and for an evening cancer was on the back-burner. it felt good. Good wishes to all having treatment this week, closing in on the end of phase one and to those beginning phase two, sending good vibes your way. Best, Kim",

More about me on my blog ... ProudMom_Wife in California Age 45, starting chemo January 5, Dose Dense AC (4x) then T (4x), all 2 weeks apart. Tundra in Montreal, Canada Age 35, started chemo Dec 28th, (2010); Taxol: weekly for 12 weeks. Then on to AC... JulieH in Summerville, SC age 44, starting chemo January 18: 4 AC/2 wks apart, 4 TC/2weeks (neulasta 24 hours after the AC and TH) then weekly herceptin for the rest of the year. aimster1123 from MO age 42, starting chemo Jan 13: TC 4x, 3 weeks apart. But, it's my second time around with BC (and no, I don't have BRCA--just \"lucky\")--had it in 07, too, and had FAC 4x, 3 weeks apart. So it's my second time losing hair and all that. Ask me anything you want! Many people call chemo \"doable\" but for me it was absolutely hideous, and my onc would agree. I'm hoping this time will be better, but not expecting it. I can give more details if you want them. :)",

You shouldn't have to suffer at all.  GoatLisa - Welcome, we're here for you whine and all.  It's frustrating to deal with an infection and bumps along the way.  I think you should celebrate your birthday early AND again on your birthday ! JulieH - Sounds like you're ready and your bag is packed.  I have also included some disinfectant wipes I like to wipe down the tray at chairside, bandaids and antibiotic cream in my bag.  You never know, we seem to be a walking medicine chest these days, but I can't tell you how many times I've reached in there for this or that.  (Tylenal mostly) I inquired about supplements with my onc. and she's not in favor of adding anything additional to my diet. Since your body is already in upheavel, she encourages to eat what you can when you can, since our taste, desires may change drastically. I've had a very healthy appetite, I've done better at eating protein and veggies. It's always hard for me to hit all my fruits.  I'll begin adding unsweetened applesauce to help that.  It looks like my cellulitis/infection is beginning to respond to the new antibiotic. They gave me bactrim, and I'm concerned about it healing enough so I can still have my #2 infusion on Friday.  My second and rather main concern is will this now put me at risk for lymphodema.  I certainly hope not. What it does show is that perhaps I don't heal quickly from biopsies and with chemo added, it put me at risk. I want to be sure I heal when I have surgery and maybe I need additional antibiotics to ensure that.   I'm headed to another consult today. It's looking like another biospy is in order now on the Right Axillary. They think the PET scan showed activity from the port but for completeness sake would like to take a look via CT guidance and biopsy before Chemo #2.  The whole biopsy process turns my stomach anymore.  You'd think there would be a better way, the apparatus seems barbaric to me, but that is based on a painful stereotactic biopsy where they needed to go in at 3 different places before getting a clean sample. Okay, just had to get that off my chest, I'm moving on... Hugs to everyone and bear hugs to those who are starting their treatment this week.  Kim ",

I've been using Oil of Olay facial moisturizer on my entire head and face, and also started using Avon's Anew brightening serum and it really has added some color to my face, perkiness mostly.

It seems they don't really cc me on much, and are giving me the opportunity to concentrate on me and I'm thankful for that. Melissa & UTmom, I too got my period, during #2, I'm really hoping it was the last although I'm a little spotty today. The cramping and the length were more painful and longer than normal, so I'm hoping it was it's farewell. I want a SE-free #4, but then don't we all News on my end, results of my latest biopsy on the other side (right side) show more cancer cells, now putting me now at stage IV. Had a PET scan yesterday as a midway point to see how I'm responding to chemo and I'll learn those results on Thursday. I know the 'standard of care' is MX, I just don't know enough about my options nor am I quite ready to face that yet. I know some of you have already had your surgeries first, how on earth did you decide when presented with options. Aside from the obvious that we want to make a choice that will put me in the category of least chance of recurrence and to live a long life.. As for my hair, I buzzed it on day 19, and that pretty much took care of the sensitivity that I had. Now at 11 days post #3, I have a reverse old man look. Most of the hair on both sides is completely gone (which was gray) and the top is a shadow of a Mohawk from front to back. What are the chances of it coming in all dark, slim to none I suppose! I have a great wig that I sport at work, people keep asking when I'll lose my hair, they just think I added highlights ! Thank you to all the insight and peek into all your lives. blessings and strength to those facing fear and ugly SE's. KIm",

I'm finished with AC, I'm 4 days out and feeling really good. The only pain I have is in my hips and I really do think it's from lounging for three days on the couch. I told my DH that we'll need a new couch once I come out in the other side of this. His answer, anything you want as long as you recover. I have stange new stubble on my head, it's new since it's shorter than the buzzed hairs, I'm wondering if those too will fall out. I thought the new hairs come in much later and softer like fuzz, time will tell. Has anyone else had non-stop hot flashes? Every twenty minutes 24/7, followed by chills, minor though. It seemed to start right after treatment, but now today have minimized quite a bit. I've just been baring through it. If it continues through my Taxol, I'll ask the doc if there is anything to combat it. Mary-Meg, very happy to hear you're in the safe area, very sad for those that are affected by the quake, again. Oh, before I forget, my PET scan showed 50%+ reduction of my cancers, whoo hoo!! I meet with the BS on Friday to find out my surgery options as well as having my first consult with the genetic testing coordinator. I'm sure I'll be moving forward with the genetic testing, I have heavy family history. Best wishes to all as everyone closes in on those last remaining treatments, couldn't do it without you! Kim",

I've been a lurker for far too long. Posted when I was first diagnosed and first began chemo in Jan '11 for IIb, chemo,lumpectomy, rads. Then a clavicle recurrence treated with Xeloda/Ixempra. By the 3rd cycle had neumonic fever and stopped, Ixempra was awful. PET eventially showed NED for almost 1 year, brings us to May of '13 (along with a job downsize) and then showed 2 tiny liver mets.  Been treating with xeloda, 2000/2x day 7on/7off.  Felt like a rock star. Like you, felt like taking a vitamin (until some progression and upped to 2300 2x/day, then the HFS began for about 6 weeks). Managed that fairly well, cream/baggies/socks worked very well, almost back to normal.  PET last week showed progression and some node activity in my chest. Now I'm decided between Navelbine and Gemzar, I'll need to have a port re-inserted.  Turns out my new job was eliminated last week, 2 days before the newest diagnosis, so I won't have the added pressure of working while deciding and beginnning this next course of treatment. I was in agency advertising, then on to visual communications producer.  I just learned of the Liver Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, so I've inquired. Their are so many new liver treatments out there, wanted to see if any can be useful with stage 4 BC as a cause. Waiting on their call to set the appt.  I'll still need to address the chest nodes and will also move forward in the meantime with the port. Healthy eating, exercise, plenty of rest and a good attitude will be continue to a focal point for me. I've learned so much already from everyone here, it was time that I jump in and perhaps share with others.  ",
