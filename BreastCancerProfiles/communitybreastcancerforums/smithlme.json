I could not have made such an enormous decision as I have without the knowledge and facts I found there. Along with my fantastic geneticist, I have chosen a path that is right for me and my life. Each of my four children have chosen to get tested and their ages are 32, 24, 21 and 17. Yes, even a mature 18 year old can be tested, once they understand the implications of the test. The results are not meant to frighten them, but to, hopefully, rule them out as carriers. These decisions have not come easily, but in our family, Cancer has been in our lives, our whole lives. My sons and daughters will decide, on their own, what a positive result will mean to them. With the knowledge of an excellent, caring geneticist, they will discuss their options and surveillance will be heightened. Cancer is scary enough. Knowing that yours could be hereditary puts a totally different perspective on things. Face your fears head-on and get the facts before any decisions are made. Linda",

He wants to be positive that my final pathology report comes back clean so that I, too, know I'm ok. I had my first Mast on April 9, 2007, followed by my failed TRAM on January 28th, 2008 and emergency surgery on January 29th to amputate the muscle and remove the flap. He feels that my body has been through a lot and needs several months to heal after this upcoming Mast. I agree with all his reasons, but I am so disappointed. I emailed him back and told him that I just want to put this horrible chapter behind me and move forward. That my body has failed me again, and I must bow down to the Cancer Monster, yet again.

Each diagnosis is as different as we are, and so are the recommendations and treatment. Some days I wish I had a crystal ball to show me the way! Last March I was diagnosed with IDC and, because of my family history, I chose to have a Mastectomy. This was followed by DD AC and Taxol. I attempted TRAM flap recon in January, but due to poor blood flow, it failed and I lost the flap and muscle. This past March, I was diagnosed with a new primary of DCIS. Again, I chose another Mastectomy. Hindsight is 20/20, but I was the one who ultimately chose what I did. Since my first Cancer was a triple negative, my family history and my recent diagnosis, I have chosen to have genetic testing. If I test positive for BRCA1 or 2, my genetic counselor has recommended a total hysterectomy, and I agree. I have 4 kids and 2 1/2 (due in Sept) grandchildren to keep as educated as possible about Cancer. It's a scary thing we'ra all dealing with, but my kids know this is something we all need answers to... Linda",

As for the nail issue...before I started chemo I had my nails done often and loved how they made my stubby fingers look long and elegant. At my chemo class, it was recommended that women not have their nails done, due to the increased risk of infection. Since I ended chemo my nails are a mess. Tissue paper thin, ridges and they split all the time. I was hoping they'd improve over time, but so far, no luck. We have to give up and change so much once we're diagnosed.

As a child you were probably unaware of all she had gone through. Now that you're older and know so much more, the reality is scary. Anger is a wasted emotion, at this time. You need to focus all of your energy on your mom and yourself. Being a caregiver can be exhausting and emotional. Plan to go to your mom's doctor appointments with her, if possible.

I've read all the stories from women who have had great surgeons, fantastic reconstruction, minimal side effects and life goes on. I, too, am not one of them. Short story is that I was diagnosed with IDC on my left side in 2007. I chose to have a mastectomy, followed by DD AC and DD Taxol. I attempted TRAM reconstruction in January of 2008 and it failed. Emergency surgery followed to remove the flap and muscle. My dog ears were on my abdomen. Two months later I was diagnosed the second time with a new primary in the right breast. I chose another mastectomy, then found out I am BRCA 2+. I have since had a hysterectomy w/BSO to hopefully avoid ovarian cancer. I have tried wearing a prosthesis, but for me they are hot, heavy and uncomfortable. I have changed sizes and styles and still find them awkward.  After 5 surgeries I decided enough was enough. As I got back into the gym and attending Yoga I noticed my body changing, as well as my spirit. Yep, I was still flat with dog ears on my stomach, fat under my arms and a lumpy chest. I chose not to have implants for my own reasons. I can't \"get back\" what cancer took from me. I had to learn to accept and love myself for all I had been through. My attitude is what I had to change. I decided to have one last surgery to clean up what my former PS had created. 8 weeks ago I had scar revisions on my chest and abdomen. All I can say is that I am thrilled with the results. My chest is flat and smooth, the fat is gone under my arms and my stomach...it is shaped like a stomach is supposed to be. I'm not saying this has been an easy journey or one that I would recommend to anyone. I had to learn how to make this all work for me. There are days when I miss my breasts and looking good in certain clothes. I still get angry and feel ugly. Those days are getting longer between them. Define what is important to you. Look into your options and give yourself time to think each one through. In the meantime...hugs to you and be kind to yourself... Linda",

I should get the report from my bone scan within a few days. I also requested genetic testing since there's so much Cancer in my family, mostly from my dad's side. The woman from the Genetic Department called today because she pulled my record herself, due to my recent surgeries. She did my interview on the phone so I wouldn't have to drive into their facility. By the time we had gone through all the family history, she was quite concerned. Well...DUH! My paternal Grandmother died from BC, my sister was diagnosed with BC at 36, our Dad has had colon and kidney Cancer and I've been diagnosed twice, with two primaries and one was a triple negative. Because I have two daughters and three Grand-daughters, I want to know if I carry the gene. I now have an appointment on Monday to have my test and the results can take 4 weeks. If I have the gene...I will do whatever I have to to give myself the best chance of survival. Does this Merry-go-Round ever stop???

My paternal grandmother died of BC, my sister was 36 when she was diagnosed, my father has had Colon and Kidney Cancer and I have been diagnosed with BC, twice. My first Cancer was also a triple negative, which puts me at a high risk to have this gene. BRCA testing will tell you if you have this inherited gene. Your sisters can also be tested, as sometimes one sibling can test positive and one negative. If I test positive, it has been recommended that I have a full hysterectomy, and I agree. I have 4 kids, two sons and two daughters, who will also need to be told of this gene. Not to scare them...but to make them aware of our family's genetics. I also have grandchildren and this affects them, as well. I am fascinated with genetics, but it can be scary, too. Our goal through all this is to live.

I have put off telling my kids until after they get back from vacation next week. I found out two days before my youngest daughters Senior Ball, then it was her Disneyland trip, then her graduation, All-Night party and vacation with her sister and dad. I wanted her to have a month without any more of my health issues. One of my sisters and our mom are going to be tested, as well. I just want this surgery over so I can heal and move forward. It's been a long 15 months and I want to get off of this surgery train. This will be my fifth one, and I'm still not sure if I will ever attempt any type of recon again... Linda ",

Not only was that side flat, it was verrrry flat! In March of this year I was diagnosed again, with a new primary. I chose to have another mastectomy. I told my PS I wasn't interested in recon but he chose to do a skin sparing mastectomy. So I have my one flat side and one side that looks like a droopy eye lid! After that surgery I was diagnosed BRCA 2+ and had a hysterectomy/oophorectomy to try and stay ahead of this beast. I had 5 surgeries in 15 months and I decided I was DONE. My body, soul, mind and spirit need to heal and rest. I have to firmly believe that my life is worth more that two mounds of flesh. Even with recon I still would have no feeling in them, plus months of fills, surgery and more pain. My biggest fear is if I have recon, how would I be able to feel if a lump was under the implants? I need to take some control over my life. I choose not to wear my prosthesis as they are uncomfortable and rub along one of my scars. Clothes shopping is difficult and I still have my days when I wish I had breasts. But then I think how fortunate and blessed I am to have survived this and that I have a husband who loves me for who I am, not how well I look in clothes... Linda",

She personally walked me down to the lab, stood by me as they drew my blood, put my bar code sticker on the vial and took it to FedEx to be over nighted to Salt Lake, so it would be there this morning. I have an appointment with her on June 2, if the results are back by then. We spoke for quite a while about what all this means, in terms of my family and health. If I test positive, I will have a full hysterectomy. If it's positive it will answer my questions as to where this Cancer came from, twice. If I test negative, I will live my life wondering when/if/where it will show up next... Linda",

My second diagnosis wouldn't have happened so quickly if the radiologist hadn't trusted her gut instinct and my previous history.

The \"wait and see\" game might have ended up very serious, for me... Linda",

It helps to know this, but it also brings up many other issues. My geneticist has recommended a full hysterectomy, and I agree, as I am now at a 27% risk for ovarian cancer...too high for me. Ovarian cancer is difficult to diagnose, so waiting for the final pathology report after the hysterectomy will feel like forever. I've already had two mastectomies and both of my nipples are gone. At this point, with another major surgery coming up, I'm not sure if I will have any reconstruction. My body and spirit are tired and I need a long period of healing. The hard part for me will be telling my children, as this may affect them and my grand children. I am waiting until right before my surgery to tell them. It's been a rough 14 months and they can use a break from all my health issues. This is a very difficult decision and one that only you can make. Weigh the pros and cons and follow your heart. My goal is to live a long, healthy life and I will do everything I can to achieve it... Linda",
