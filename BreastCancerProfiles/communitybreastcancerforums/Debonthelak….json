LRM216 In order for many insurance companies to cover your BRACA testing you have to have a pretty significant history of certain cancers.  Breast, ovarian and prostate cancers are included. That's my two cents and what little information I've gleaned so far about that. God Bless",

I have been through a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation.  My treatment is behind me now except for good diet and exercise.  It is a good place to be.  My prayers are with you.  God Bless you Deb",
