While at the appointment he did my breast check. At that point he said he could feel a small 2 cm lump in my right breast. I am completely lost and scared. I have cried for days. I keep checking for other symptoms with nothing appearing. I literally feel like I am in a bubble and can't get out of it. I lost my mother 2 months ago to a stroke. She is not hear to help me or listen. I am printing up all options for treatments and what it could be. I am so so so scared. Any help or if someone is going through this that can talk would be great. Log in to post a reply",

I have been studying and working on trying to understand everything. He told me he believes it is fluid build up but if that is the case why did he have me see this specific doctor. I am so scared. I am looking at the web site etc and seeing what other symptoms I would have.  Does anyone have advice.",
