Question:  How do you handle telling people.  My GP told me to talk with my husband but all I see when I go to tell him is how I am going to change his world I can't even begin to imagine how it is going to be to tell my children.  How do you handle feeling this horrible about...now here I go crying again. How did you guys do it?  What makes it easier...time. I am so not used to not having  control over my life, my cancer yodas some advice please.",
