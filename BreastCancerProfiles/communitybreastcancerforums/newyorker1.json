I wanted to avoid as much additional radiation as possible adn my oncologist agreed.  So.... no matter what they say it still makes you nervous.  I will be getting the 6 week schedule.  Initially the rad onc recommended the shortened 4 week schedule but after doing my CT scan saw that \"a little bit of heart\" was in the treatment field and wanted to go slower and do the more traditional 6 week schedule.  Everyone says it will be fine but since I am on herceptin as well I was concerned.  I considered a masectomy to avoid the radiaiton but inthe end decided to stay with the radiation. Looking forward to hearing how all of you do. NewYorker1",
