After the inital shock and my husband making me promise to fight it , I got pretty mad at what I could not see and was determined that it would not beat me. I never felt sick and I had chemo and rads. Also had a mastectomy.  I am going for my first 3 mth check with being cancer free.  Keep a strong mind.  Remember it invaded your body how dare it!!!!! Ill be praying for you.  Cheryl",
