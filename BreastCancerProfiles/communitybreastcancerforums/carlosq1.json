I'm not sure the type of cancer, the doctor says that according with results did not compromise any lymph node, but will only be sure in the surgery.and he only said that cancer is in stage 2 This hospital that my mother is, is one of the best in Japan , but it seems the worst for me. there is another less reputable hospital where i live, I will try to take her there, but I am afraid if the doctor's response will be the same. My answer to:Jackster51 After knowing this, I believe that doctors here has no experience with obese people. My anser to :mustlovepoodles I think the doctor has no experience with overweight people. In Japan or you lose the weight that they wish ou die with cancer :(. I'm Brazilian, I was thinking of taking her to Brazil, but there the treatament is very expensive and we do not have a health plan in Brazil. Please, Let me make some questions: Did you have chemotherapy before surgery? Did you have diabetes or hypertension when did chemotherapy ou surgery",

She has diabetes and hypertension and weighs 98 pounds, the doctor does not want to indicate surgery or chemotherapy until she loses 10 pounds, otherwise she is at risk of life due to the dosage being according to weight will have many side effects. It's been 3 months since she found out but has not received chemotherapy yet according to him the cancer will not spread until she loses weight, but for her to lose weight it will take about 2 months, i'm very worried. I really do not trust doctors here in Japan, after that. Anyone her had any restrictions about the body weight to do chemotherapy or surgery? Or knows anyone who had ? Please let me know.

Her weight is 98 kg. here in japan people are very thin, So for him, my mother is very fat to receive the chemotherapy. The Docor is worried about the side effects, He says if he gives chemotherapy now he's not responsible, because the dosage is according to the weight. So, In order to not lose time, we scheduled the surgery before chemotherapy.We marked the surgery for March, until she has to reach 90 kg. I'm worried it'll be up to 5 months without chemotherapy.
