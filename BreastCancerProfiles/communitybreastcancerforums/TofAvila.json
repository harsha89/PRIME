UCLA is a Cancer Research Institute ( as are many other teaching hospitals) and so I had access to Dr John Glasby, Director of oncology at UCLA. He agreed to monitor my test results and chemo from UCLA - even though I live three hours north. My local medical oncologist is fine with this. Perhaps you might seek out a second FISH test at an institution that has a funded cancer research center, as they normally have access to latest and greatest information. I did a lumpectomy, no nodes, clear margins stage 1, grade 3 HER2+ - so my treatment is 6 rounds of TCH, followed by radiation and Herceptin for one year. My tumor was 1.4cm. Hope this helps.",
