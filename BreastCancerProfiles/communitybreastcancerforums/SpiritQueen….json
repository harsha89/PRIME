It was those test that I discovered I had other \"suspicious areas\"  and it has lead to an upcoming biopsy. I was so shocked that I didn't ask any questions.  I have learned a lot on this website and feel better informed. Becoming educated has lessened my stress level and allowed me to put this in God's hands. I pray for all the women who have been diagnosed with BC. I am glad this website is here so we have each other to lean on, learn from and pray with.",
