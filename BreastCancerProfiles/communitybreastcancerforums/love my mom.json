      "Content": "love-my-mom wrote: My mom has been diagnosed with Stage 4 advanced breast cancer (ER-/PR-/HER2-, liver, bone and lung mets) in March this year. She went through 6 rounds of AT - did a PET-CT after that and found out that her breast lump decreased in size to about half, but her liver/lungs mets increased! Onc recommended Xeloda - went through 1 round; a day after completion of Xeloda cycle, her bilirubin level went to 6.0, and 4 days after the completion of Xeloda cycle, went to 8.1! Her SGOT/SGPT/GGT are all very high! Dr stopped chemo treatment and is treating her symptomatically now. To all the stage 4 survivors with liver mets - any advice/suggestion what chemo treatment can still be given at this stage to check liver mets?Thank you so much!!!
