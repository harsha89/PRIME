The results from my biopsy were \"at least atypical ductal hyperplasia and suspicions of in situ duct carninoma\". The next recommended step is excision of the involved area. Would any of you ask for a second opinion before they performed the surgery or do you think that the risks are high enough that they should perform it given the uncertainty? I don't want any cancer in my body. Period. But I also would like to leave my body intact if possible. I'm from Canada and I'm not sure if reconstructive surgery would be covered here. I'm really not vain but my boobs are my boobs and even though I hate them and feel betrayed by them right now I still love them!! BTW - my sister (age 46) had two lumpectomies last year, has not had reconstructive surgery and although I've only seen her breast right after the surgery they were totally hacked up. And trust me... I'm smart enough to know how ridiculous I sound right now but it's early days and I've got a million conflicting thoughts going through my head and I'm scared and I'm processing and I have absolutely no answers and very little control over anything right now and maybe I'm just grasping at one little thing I can control.",
