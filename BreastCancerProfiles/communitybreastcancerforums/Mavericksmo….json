If you are in the middle of the state, I know Hershey Medical Center  and Lancaster General  are excellent.  Pittsburg has to have some great cancer hospitals or depts. in hospitals, but I don't know what they are because I am on the east end of PA.  I hope this helps.

The short version: In the summer of 2003 I had a lumpectomy and then a re-excision. My breast was bright red, cherry red, immediately after the surgery and remained like that for years.  I had 4 rounds of chemo then radiation in Dec 2003-Feb 2004.   The RO didn't even want to do the radiation, she thought I had inflammatory BC.  By day 21 of radiation I had jellybean size blisters on the top of my breast and the whole underside had slough, no skin.  I was treated with Silvadine for two weeks, then had the rest of my rads.  It took a long time to heal, I don't remember how long, but I was left with very tough skin.  Fast forward to Jan 2019, recurrence with mastectomy with DIEP reconstruction. Now dealing with large wounds on the underside of my breast, open wounds that have no skin. (looks like an uncooked beef roast without fat). They bleed and ooze. My doctor said they were caused by the radiation I had in 2003, he told me prior to surgery that this could happen.  I have been so frustrated as my Plastic Surgeon told me to only use soap and water and keep them covered.  I am on my 6th box of 100 non-adherent gauze pads! Today I called to see if there was anything I could do other that what I was directed to do and increasing protein in my diet. I wanted to go to a wound center.  I was told no, that it will just take time.   I feel so much better after reading that article.  It seems to confirm what my doctor told me.  He said the wounds have granular tissue, not skin, but that the skin surrounding the wound will grow and gradually fill in and heal. I need to go back to work in May and I plan to go back even without completely healed wounds because I simply can't stay out any longer. Spinnerpom, thank you, thank you, thank you!  I was running out of hope and felt so frustrated.  You would think my second time with breast cancer would be easier, it's not, but it doesn't prevent feelings of positive hope from happening through information on this message board!",

I had a diagnosis of ILC in December 2018, same breast and was refused a BMX! I was told this cancer hospital in Philadelphia doesn't remove healthy breasts! I know they do for BRCA patients, apparently my life, my fears were not worthy? I'm so angry that the choice was not offered to me. Why do they tell women to do everything to prevent a recurrence yet they won't do the same? I'm so glad others were given the choice. I'm older now too. So far my mom, my two sisters and I all had breast cancer! I know it will come back again, the only question is when. If I get it in my right breast, the hospital is going to hear from me and NO, I won't have another surgery there ",

I am still upset that my breast surgeon refused to give me the option of a bilateral mastectomy.  I was just coming to the grips with that when my older sister was diagnosed with a less than 1 cm IDC and her doctor offered her a bilateral mastectomy, mastectomy or lumpectomy.  She had a lumpectomy last week and is doing well.  In my immediate family my mother had IDC (late in life), my oldest sister had IDC and lymphoma at the same time, I had IDC and 15 1/2 years later, ILC, and now my second oldest sister had IDC.  I am BRCA negative.  I was set up to meet with a risk assessment woman but cancelled. I feel the BRCA  defect is really the only one I am worried about passing on to my children and since I am neg, they can't get it from me.  They, and my nieces know that they need to tell their doctors about our family history and have early mammograms. While it could be environmental, my oldest sister moved to another state when I was about 12.  She was married when I was 9. I am the youngest of 5, with my brother being the oldest. I have one sister still undiagnosed. She is proactive on her testing. I thought I got breast cancer because I am over weight, always was, but my sisters and mother were not. I find some questions aren't worth trying to find answers for.",

I had a 1cm, 0/24, E/P + Her2 - IDC in 2003 (Lumpectomy, re-excision, chemo, rads) 1.3 cm E/P + Her2 - ILC in 2018. (Mastectomy w/reconstruction only- no nodes removed because whole fat pad removed in 2003) I'm under the impression that if I had a recurrence it would be at the mastectomy site or other breast before it would metastasis anywhere else in my body. I refused AI's for reasons I won't go into other than I made that decision due to my other health issues. I had surgery in Jan, saw my breast surgeon for one follow up and won't see him again until the middle of the summer. I'm only seeing a plastic surgeon now. I only discuss surgery issues with him. I saw a medical oncologist once. I had questions after my appointment and sent an email with three questions . By the time she reached out to me about my questions it was over three weeks later and ironically (or not) I onlygot a message on my answering machine that she called to answer the questions a few hours after I cancelled my next appointment with her. I left a message with her nurse telling her why I canceled the appointment and why I refused the IA and said she can call me but I doubted she would change my mind. I never heard back and it's been over a month.",

I had 15 1/2 cancer free years between recurrences and yes, I could get another in a year..... or maybe never. At my age there is a good chance I will die of something else before I get a recurrence. I will talk about it again when I see my breast surgeon in the summer but I won't go back to the medical oncologist because she is set on hormone therapy and I am not.  I will look up the faslodex.  I never heard of it.   ",

I'm scared.....and angry that this is our choice, living in pain, with worse health, higher cholesterol, more risk of Alzheimer's, weight gain, etc for a hypothetical longer life! We shouldn't have to choose! We need to start pressuring the research community to find a new drug that DOES NOT rely on diminishing estrogen to prevent recurrences! The side effects have less to do with the AI used and more to do with the depleted estrogen. In other words, the drugs prevent estrogen formation which feeds estrogen positive breast cancer. But, our bodies, even after menopause, need estrogen to function well, which is why our bodies continue to make it in our fat and brain cells! I'm choosing quality of life over quantity which totally sucks! BTW, I already have two replaced shoulders and a family history of Alzheimer's. If I have bone pain I can't second guess if it's from Letrozole or not. I watched my mother die a slow death with time slowly robbing her mind. Being the youngest child in the family, she forgot who I was first. It was heartbreaking! I need all the estrogen I have in my brain!",
