Yeah, I had the aches and pains and absurd hot flashes, but nothing that prevented me from having a great QOL.  Good luck to all of you with your decisions!!",

They are actually glands that will aid secretion when you eventually breastfeed an infant. I can't remember the name of them off the top of my head, but they are normal and will be there the rest of your life!!",
