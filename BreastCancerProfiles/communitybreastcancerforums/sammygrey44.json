I never had a large tumor -- I had ILC in the left breast and she couldn't get clear margins during the lumpectomy.  My cancer was grade 2, which I've heard is average in regards to aggressiveness.  Grrrrrr. . . I'm so tired of all these HEAVY decisions!  I\"m still pondering Tamoxifin, but I'll save that for that board. Take care and hugs to everyone on here. . . side hug for all of us just out of surgery or a procedure. Sammy Log in to post a reply",
