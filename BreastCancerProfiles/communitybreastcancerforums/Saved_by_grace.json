    "Content": "Saved_by_grace wrote: Hi , I was diagnosed with DCIS in my right breast after noticing bleeding from nipple. The mammogram showed a small cancer , but after an MRI realized it was all through my breast. I just went to see the surgeon again today and told her I do not want reconstruction. She recommended a Goldilocks mastectomy bilaterally. Has anyone had this ? Are you happy with the results? I wonder if this is better than flat? Any ideas? Thanks so much Lisa Log in to post a reply",
