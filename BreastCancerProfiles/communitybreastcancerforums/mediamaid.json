I have to admit, though, that I am thankful for the diagnosis as it means the cancer was found before it was untreatable. If it hadn't been found when it was, my story might not have such a nice ending. I'm four years out and doing fine. Thanks for sharing. It's always nice to learn how people from other countries and cultures celebrate. We can all use a little health and good luck.",
