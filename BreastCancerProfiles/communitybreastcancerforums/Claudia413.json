You can read all the signs and symptoms at the website for the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Foundation (www.eraseIBC.com). IBC is highly aggressive and very deadly if not caught early (the earliest it is diagnosed is stage IIIb). I was diagnosed with IBC in August 2007. None of my doctors knew about IBC. I did my research and knew what I had. They did not. I'm now a volunteer with the IBCF and try to help women get a proper diagnosis instead of being laughed at or told to stop doing research online.  I'd be dead now if I hadn't done my research and then fought for my life. ",

I just kept pushing until I got IBC ruled out (or in, as this case was). It's important to know about what you might have (IBC). I am now a volunteer with the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Foundation (www.eraseibc.com) and invite you to look over our website, check out the videos, see what links we have that may be of assistance to you financially and otherwise, and know that there's help out there. Please let us know what happens. We all care. ",

Too many doctors want to get you into surgery asap, but that's not always the right thing to do. Read all the info on IBC at the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Foundation (www.eraseibc.com) website. Get yourself educated, then educate the medical professionals you see. Take a copy of the IBC brochure with you, give to every one you see, including mammo techs, u/s techs, etc. There are many medical professionals who have never seen a case of IBC, or at least never recognized one when they saw it. Education is the key. Pass out the brochure to friends and family. Good luck to all who are waiting from a 4-yr IBC survivor in South Florida. ",

What women are NOT taught, is that most lumps aren't cancer.\" I would like to add this to that: All breast cancer does NOT have a lump.  Your doctor tells you to feel for lumps and have your yearly mammogram, right? Well that's good advice as far as it goes. You also need to know that there's a breast cancer that usually does not have a lump and therefore doesn't usually show up on a routine mammogram. It's Inflammatory   Breast Cancer (IBC). It's what I was diagnosed with in 2007. Learn the signs and symptoms of IBC by visiting the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Foundation (www.eraseibc.com). While there, watch several videos about IBC. As everyone else says, if you find a lump, have it checked out. If you notice ANY changes in your breast, please contact a breast specialist.   ",
