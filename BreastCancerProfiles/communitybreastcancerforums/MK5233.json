I originally was scheduled to have a sentinel node biopsy but because of scarring from previous surgeries (breast reduction and benign lumpectomy) the sentinel way did not work so thus the reason for the dissection.  Well, I had prepared mentally for the original procedure but not for the axillary node removal.  Now my right arm from the wrist up is numb (a side effect I wasn't aware of) and the constant worry of lymphedema.  I'm so depressed about the numbness. I know I shouldn't be but I am... On top of everything else, I just learned my 16 year old kitty has cancer and another one I have that has cancer is  losing her battle with cancer. Thanks for listening.  I guess one day at a time is all I can do right now...  Log in to post a reply",
