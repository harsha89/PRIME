About 5 weeks ago I got a red areas on my right breast after I was in a pool all day, my bathing suit kept falling off and the pool didn't have Clorine in it (well not as much as it should). The area has stayed about the same size but the redness fluctuates Sometimes it's really bad sometimes it's lighter. I went to my gyno he thought maybe it was fungal and gave me a cream, the first day I put it on the redness was completely gone but now it's back Tuesday will be a week that I've been to the dr. It's still there. I'm very concerned it keeps me up at night. I suffer from fibromyalgia, anxiety and depression and I'm having a very difficult time with this . My husband isn't very understanding and thinks I'm over reacting. I also have a huge polyp in my Uterus which with be removed in September along with a dnc. The area on my breast doesn't itch or hurt the area is thick and looks like an orange peel. I am taking antibiotics and prednisone. For a sinus infection Log in to post a reply",
