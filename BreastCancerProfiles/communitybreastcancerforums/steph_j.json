After finishing rads, I will be on tamoxifen for 5 years and I am not looking forward to it at all. However, my oncologist is adamant about hormone therapy for those with hormone positive tumors. He even said before chemo, that if he had to choose, he would want me to do tamoxifen. This really emphasized for me how important it is.",
