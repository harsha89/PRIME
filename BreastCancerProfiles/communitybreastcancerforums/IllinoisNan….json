I had my (10th routine) annual mammogam with a ultrasound and biopsy immediatley following all on a Friday.  The radiologist wouldn't let me leave until he had all the samples and photos he needed. I worreid all weekend and then got the news that it was cancer. When the doctor took my biopsy, he looked me in the eyes and said he thinks it looks like cancer.  The lab that checked my biopsy at the local facility said I had IDC but when I got to the surgeon and a bigger lab they said ILC.  It really doesn't matter which one because they treat them the same.  Anyway....34 radiation treatments later and 3 years of Tamoxifen under my belt, I'm happy to say I'm doing great.  I think the part you are in is the worst but it will get better...trust me:) Have faith in the doctors and try not to stress. I would recommend a Xanex or something to help you relax. I took Lexapro and Xanax in the early days and now I'm happier than I've ever been and living and loving life like I never did before.

I wish you well with your decision.  Only you can know what is right for you.  Pam, I just got back from my tests and everything went well.  I was in and out in an hour.  Now I just need to get thru tomorrows last chemo and the Neulasta shot on Thurs.  It seems like I have been on chemo for a year!!  Hope you all have a great day!",

Surgery is over, 3 nights in hospital, did full reconstruction so no TE's which was a big surprise, nodes looked good so they did not take any, right side was clear of all cancer and healing well, LAT flap cut on back is very sore but healing, Left breast is not doing as well as I expected.  Took most of the skin but could not take it all.  Radiated skin is healing very slowly, very black in color.  ILC was still found in left breast but BS expected that (I had hoped for other results). Chemo had erased if from the skin but not from behind the nipple where it was hiding.  Came home with  4 drains and a big pain tube bulb.  Since then I have had the pain bulb tubes removed and one drain tube so I'm down to 3.  Husband has been draining and recording amounts so I think I will get one more out today.  I will need to have two in for the weekend and aleast until Tuesday when I have my next appointment.  This has been much harder than I thought.  Non radiated skin is wonderful.....radiated skin is bad.  If I had it all to do over since 2006, I would never had a lumpectomy with rads.  I would have gone for the full masectomy.  Healing would be so much easier.  Hope all of you are doing well.  I feel battered and beaten.  BC is really horrible and I hate it more with each passing day.
