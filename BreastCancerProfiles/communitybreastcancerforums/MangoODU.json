    "Content": "MangoODU wrote: I found a lump 3 days ago, saw my GYN next day and had my mammogram and ultrasound completed today. Findings are an 8 mm likely complex cyst, but they cannot rule out a solid mass. I am scheduled for fineneedle aspiration and possible biopsy tomorrow with a local breast surgeon. I am scared of the possible diagnosis. Can anyone tell me more about the procedure? I'm hoping to take a long lunch break to have it done, then return to work. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
