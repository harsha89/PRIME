I was a size C but I actually would like to be B because I do like to do tings like jog/run, go to the gym, hike, bike ride, and I think being smaller for me would be easier. At the initial surgery they were able to fill me halfway, and I will need probably only 3 fills before I switch to silicone implants. I am 42, active mom of three and I have to say I feel like this whole experience has been much better than I thought it would be. I am already able to go out for long walks, I do the physical therapy exercises, and I am getting around great. I did have the skin-sparing, but not nipple sparing because I had DCIS in my right breast and it was close enough to the nipple that I did not want to risk any recurrence. My surgeon did not recommend it either. I too have family history, and am BRCA1+. I do have scars across both breasts, they cannot be seen even when I wear low cut tops. It was really hard the day they took off the dressings, I sobbed for most of that evening, but each day gets so much better....it really does. It is so worth being around for a long life. Scars will fade. HANG IN THERE, BIG HUGS, YOU ARE STRONG and have so much in life to be hopeful for. This journey of figuring everything out is scary, but this website is a great resource too. I hope this helps... Hugs, mamacma",
