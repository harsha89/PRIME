      "Content": "Jan 16, 2009 01:16PM nosurrender wrote: This was a  really good article on constipation that was in CURE magazine. Apparently there is a new drug out there that really helps if you are on pain killers: IN EVERY ISSUE:CURE 2008 Keep It Moving BY LACEY MEYER Constipation during treatment can be alleviated. Suffering from constipation is no longer an accepted part of cancer treatment. Whether it\u2019s a side effect of chemotherapy or opioids (narcotic medications) used to treat cancer-related pain, today there are many ways to alleviate constipation without interfering with cancer treatment or pain relief.  CAUSES > Constipation results when stools stay in the bowel too long, becoming dry and difficult to pass. Some classes of chemotherapy drugs, such as vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and platinum agents, affect the nerve supply to the bowel and slow down the natural movement and rhythm of the intestines in addition to affecting appetite and normal physical activity abilities. Up to 90 percent of cancer patients experience cancer-related pain, and opioids, such as morphine, hydrocodone (Vicodin, Lortab) and oxycodone (Percocet, OxyContin), frequently cause constipation. Opioids effectively relieve pain by binding to certain receptors in the brain and spinal cord, but they also bind to receptors found in the intestines, leading to constipation in about half of patients by disrupting contractions that help move stools downward. Without contractions, stools stay in the intestines longer and become dry and hard as the body reabsorbs the water. MANAGEMENT > Constipation is one of the most common and debilitating side effects in patients taking opioids, and since constipation can be predicted, a bowel regimen should always begin at the same time as opioid use. Several over-the-counter medications are available, including stimulant laxatives Senokot (senna) and Dulcolax (bisacodyl), which increase contractions in the bowel; stool softeners, such as Colace and Surfak (docusate), which help retain water in the bowel to soften the stool; and osmotic laxatives, such as lactulose, which use osmosis to pull water into the intestines. To achieve optimum results, a stimulant is typically given with a stool softener to move the stool through the intestines before the body reabsorbs the water. Studies show it is unlikely that stimulant laxative use at the recommended dose will cause dependency. In addition, there is no risk of so-called rebound constipation after stopping laxative intake, according to research published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology. In April, the Food and Drug Administration approved Relistor (methylnaltrexone) to treat opioid-induced constipation in patients with late-stage, advanced illnesses, including cancer, AIDS, and lung disease. Relistor, which is given by subcutaneous injection (under the skin), blocks the opioid receptor in the gastrointestinal tract but because it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier it does not interfere with opioids\u2019 pain-relieving properties housed in the brain. Relistor is the first drug approved for opioid-induced constipation, and studies for this indication are under way with similar agents, including Entereg (alvimopan), oral PEG-Naloxol, and Naloxone. PREVENTION > In addition to doctor-recommended medications, prevention strategies should be utilized as much as possible to promote regular bowel movement and function. Eating high-fiber foods such as beans, peaches, squash, broccoli, carrots, and whole-grain bread and bran can minimize constipation because fiber helps to hold water in the stool, making it heavier and able to move through the intestines faster. Experts recommend 20 to 35 grams of fiber per day, but this should be accompanied by sufficient amounts of non-caffeinated fluid because fiber without enough fluids can result in hard, dry stools. Some fiber preparations cause gas, so patients can experiment with different fiber products or use antigas medications such as simethicone. The recommended 30 minutes of moderate exercise each day not only helps to stay in shape, but also serves as a preventive measure for cancer patients at an increased risk of constipation. Physical activity helps move food through the bowels, while lack of activity can slow food by reducing muscle contractions in the intestines and abdomen.",

I am sorry I didn't see your post earlier so you could have given them a call.  I bet the fact that you can't be physically active is making this worse. Does bearing down hurt your back too? That can make it painful to go and then that helps make the constipation worse...It is like a vicious cycle! I hope you don't get an impaction. If worst comes to worst there is always Fleets Phospho Soda that they sell in the little green bottles at the drug store. It comes in \"lemon\" flavor - but drink a chaser of a soda you like to kill the taste of it. That stuff is like dynamite. It is what they give to start the clean out process for a colonoscopy.   The duclolax and stool softeners work well too, but they can take a couple of days. The Phospho soda is faster. Also, if it has been a long time since you went, you may have hard stools. My onc told me to use a mineral oil Fleets to soften followed by a regular Fleets- but I don't know if you can be doing the contorting required to get a Fleets- you have to lie on the floor on your left side or with your butt in the air and that would be really hard for you I think right now... Try the prune juice but have some phospho soda in the house just in case. I really hope you go soon. Hang in there, Marsha!",

My sister has a horse farm and she never missed a day of what she needed to do  there. My personal opinion is hit it hard when you are first diagnosed. That is the best way to knock down your tumor and  ensure a long, cancer free life. Chemo and rads sound really scary, but they don't last forever and you can keep up with your life while doing them.  The thing thing about cancer is you can't hide from it. It follows you. And next year, wouldn't you rather know that you did EVERYTHING you could to beat it rather than, I wish I had done something about this.... It is all a personal decision, and the fear can really make decisions so much harder to make. But I have had cancer twice, two totally unrelated to each other, I have done chemo twice, and I am fine now and living life to the fullest. You can do this. You will need to have a big family meeting and delegate some of the household chores that normally will fall on you... but you have nine kids! I am sure they would be happy to help out when you are not feeling up to snuff. Good luck with whatever you decide. Hugs, g ",

I never heard of spontaneaous infection. My PS said that because my skin is radiated and I have a foreign object in there I am more prone to things like this happening. It came on suddenly. I woke up feeling like my skin was inside out and all my nerve endings were exposed. Then it started to concentrate in the axilla and around the tissue expander. It was then that I called my PS and asked him if I should go ahead and take one of the Levaquin I have in the house. I did and then a few hours later my temp spiked and I felt about as bad as I ever felt. The next morning I went to the ER and they gave me IV antibiotics and I got myself released because we had a big family wedding that day. I missed the ceremony but made it to the reception. I really don't want to miss any joyful events so it was important to me. My wbc has gone down finally. So this is just the residual infection working its way out. But I have to say, this hurt more than my surgery did. I have been very unhappy with my LE place. In fact, just last week, before this happened, I complained to them because my arms have not gone down one bit since I started last summer. I asked for sleeves and they said their sleeve provider doesn't accept my insurance and I would have to \"let my fingers do the walking\" in the phone book and find my own place. The other LE place I went to before my cancer returned had a custom made sleeve made for me with no trouble at all. I don't even know what to order. This whole thing has been such a shock to me. I know when I have been bad and not as careful as I should be. But I have been extraordinarily careful and especially last week because I wanted my arms to be as small as possible for the wedding.

Is he saying he wants to re-excise the area to get cleaner margins? Is he suggesting that radiation will take care of this? Before you do anything I would see another breast surgeon and bring your films. I would also ask to have your tissue samples sent to a large hospital for a second opinion. My original tumor was sent to Memorial Slone Kettering for another opinion. Thankfully, their pathologist agreed with the original pathologist. I would also speak to an oncologist as well. It is better to get a re-excision in my opinion and be sure you have all the cancer removed then to be \"hoping\" that the radiation will take care of it. I would think twice about using that doc again though. I know it seems like a lot of work and hassle now- but in the long run, you will be happy you got everything taken care of NOW rather than later. Good luck with everything! g my site ",

I know when I was first diagnosed all I wanted was to hear from someone who had been through everything already. I was first diagnosed at age 39 in 2001. I am still here! When you are first diagnosed it is the worst time. Everything is being thrown at you- all these new terms and you almost have to get a medical degree in a week to understand.  You will feel much better when you have a plan in place and you have made the best decisions for yourself. The best thing to do right now is to not think too far ahead. Don't project to next month or next year. Just do what you have to do now. Just worry about what you have to worry about right at this very moment... nothing more. It will all work out in time.  It is OK to be scared. It is also OK to give yourself permission to think of yourself as someone who will beat this and have it all behind them.  There are over 2 million survivors walking around doing just fine in the US right now with all of this behind them. There are incredible advances that have been made and your future may be a bit nerve wracking right now- but- once you arm yourself with all the info you need, get your plan in place, and do what you have to do, you will get back to your life again.  I promise! Hang in there!! Hugs, g",

The researcher has attended practically all of these oncology conferences and has extensively studied the latest test and trial results and put them all together for me to share with you. As you can read at the bottom, the studies you see here will be presented at December's San Antonio Breast Cancer symposium. This man was even kind enough to present a dear friend of mine's case to a group of top oncologists at one of their round table discussions.

If someone is looking at surgery I just wanted you to know that almost six years ago I had a lumpectomy with full axillary dissection for a trip negative cancer. It was followed by chemo and rads. Another, brand new estrogen positive cancer was found this February and I had a bilateral mastectomy with tissue expanders. I am currently in chemo but when I am done I will need rads and then I hope to have my final touch surgery done with silicone implants. I would be glad to help anyone new. Getting a diagnosis is bad enough, then you think the surgery is worse than the diagnosis, but after your done with surgery it will seem easy when you compare it to starting chemo. This beast makes us tough cookies who are true warriors. Getting cancer removed from your body is empowering. And if you check out the recon thread you will see that many are happy with their results. I know I am. Good luck to all, g nosurrenderbreastcancerhelp.org ~What a long, strange trip it's been...

And I am no worse for the wear, as my mother would say. Make sure you drink a lot of liquids the first two days after your infusion Take all your meds on schedule- even if you feel fine- because you can prevent nausea but it is hard to stop it once it starts Never let your stomach get too empty, always have something to nibble on Keep active- it really does help And if you feel tired, lie down and rest! Don't push yourselves. I wore a wig- I bought it before my hair came out. I had it styled to my style and my color so when the time came I looked just like myself. I didn't always wear it. When I worked in the garden I would wear a hat with an attached pony tail and of course I had lots of scarves. If your head gets hot and itchy from the wig try some Sea Breeze on your scalp. It really is soothing. Remember, this is not forever and you will be done with it. Good luck!!! hugs, g ",

One oncologist told me that you have 18 weeks from surgery to start chemo as the maximum time. I think that is pushing it in my opinion. My current oncologist said I should start as soon as I was healed from my surgery.  You do have some wiggle room so don't worry if you don't start immediately, but don't go past the 18 week mark. I wish you luck. You will get through this. It seems really hard and confusing now, but soon things will fall into place.",

I had to get a chest MRI and my onc scheduled it and I walked into the radiation place and they had me fill out the form if I had any \"foreign objects\" in my body. I remember saying something like, except for the expanders, and the tech said that was OK. Then it dawned on me at the last minute that I had metal in my expander ports because they use that magnet before the fills. So I called my PS from the radiation place and spoke to his nurse and they told me not to have it done. I honestly don't think the tech knew the difference between an expander and an implant. Later, when I saw my PS, he told me the MRI can make the expander port move or become inaccessible.  I have had a ruptured expander and it doesn't hurt and it doesn't cause any damage because it is only filled with saline. But your expanders may be still be OK. You will probably have to get a sonogram to see where everything is now. But it sounds like they stopped the test before it was too late. It all sucks - I know- esp when you are in the middle of all of it. I had rads with my expanders too- and that was all OK too, so I hope that eases your mind some. Hugs g",
