I have been able to think my way through this all and am starting to realize that I do tend to think catastrophically about everything. I'm an experienced RN who cares for women to have undergone extensive mastectomies, and skin flaps, tissue expander placement and replacements so that is where my mind automatically went when the radiologist did not give me the automatic \"you're all good it's just normal dense breast tissue\" following the breast ultrasound. No, I was not aware of the titanium markers, and yes it makes me a little nervous. That nervousness I am sure it not a big deal to some, but to someone who suffers from health anxiety it is something that will be on my mind for a long time. However, I am thinking about listening to the radiologist's original rec of waiting the 6 months and having a repeat ultrasound. I thank you all for your responses and experiences. It's not an easy thing to deal with regardless of what the outcome is. It's the fear of the unknown and uncertainty in life that is scary. Thanks again...",

However, I'm worried about that <0.8% chance that is might be something else and I wouldn't want to have to deal with the possibility of it getting any larger than it already is. I am aware of the potential of scar tissue build up, and am also concerned about the titanium clip being left in place after the biopsy is completed. I'm so glad that I found this site and am able to talk to people that have been in this situation or something similar. It's definitely better than \"googling\" everything and getting scared of all the what-ifs. My biopsy is scheduled for 4/27 and will take the next week to think about everything involved in the waiting and watching versus the biopsy. I figured, if I still feel like continuing with the biopsy, perhaps the radiologist can do another ultrasound prior to the biopsy and take another look. Perhaps since I had gotten the initial ultrasound done 2-3 days after my period ended and I was poking and prodding at my breast the day before and day of that things could have gotten irritated and inflamed. Maybe time, and steering clear of caffeine will have caused the lesion to decrease in size, proving that it's just a benign lesion. At least, that's what I am hoping and praying for. Thanks so much for your input. I will take all of the input that I can get from everyone on this site. It's truly appreciated!",

This corresponds to the palpable abnormality, measures approximately 9 x 10 x 7 mm, and shows no internal flow on color doppler imaging. The finding is probably benign and is most likely to represent debris within a dilated duct or complicated cyst. However, after discussion with the patient she is requesting biopsy. Note, all four quadrants of the right breast were examined as well as the right axilla. There are normal appearing lymph nodes in the right axilla. IMPRESSION: AREA IN THE RIGHT BREAST IS PROBABLY BENIGN. FOLLOW-UP IN 6 MONTHS IS RECOMMENDED. HOWEVER, PATIENT IS REQUESTING BIOPSY AT THIS TIME. NEXT ORDER(S) NEEDED - US GUIDED BREAST BIOPSY W/HH DEVICE RT (19083) ACR BI-RADS Category 3 - Probably Benign  So, I appeared anxious (I'm sure) and the radiologist said I had the option to recheck or to have the biopsy and not drive myself crazy with all of the what-ifs between now and 6 months from now. He felt the area, states that he's felt many C lumps before and mine did not feel like it had cancerous characteristics and he said by looking at the ultrasound its characteristics are that of a benign lump as well. I'm constantly thinking about this situation and thinking about my options. Did I open up a can of issues by asking for the biopsy? I'm feeling like I should have left it all alone, but it's the fear of the unknown that's killing me.",
