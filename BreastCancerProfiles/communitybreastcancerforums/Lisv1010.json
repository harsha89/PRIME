The A/C was rough cause I\u2019m on my feet all day and but it helped doing that one every 2 weeks, now the taxol, it\u2019s going ok but now I\u2019m having back and leg pain, I\u2019m hoping its from the chemo and not a new problem, my job is understanding and caring and flexible so I\u2019m blessed. I was a nervous wreck before I went back to work, not knowing how this wasn\u2019t gonna effect me, but I\u2019m doing ok, I thank god for getting me through work day as I pull in my driveway. When I get home nome I rest, 7 more to go",
