My oncologist called me to give me my score on voice mail and told me my score was \"high\". Did not bother to tell me the relative value. This was on a very long, 3-day weekend. So I found the Oncotype site and found out the scoring system. It made me feel better that 30-100 was considered high. At least I was closer to the low end of the \"high\" chance for recurrence. In my case, the fear of chemo was far worse than the chemo itself. I had dose dense AC followed by Taxol (which gave a bad side effect) so switched to Taxoterre. For me Adrimycin and Cytoxin were easier to handle than the Taxoterre. During all the chemo from Jan-May 07, I never once felt nausea or vomited. Toward the end of treatment I had low energy but kept a very healthy diet which I believe helped. Believe it or not, the months on chemo went quickly. The cancer center staff was so wonderful. It became a welcoming place. There other people had bald heads and understood what we are all going through. I had a goal, to rid my body of cancer. Each week, I knew I was closer to my goal. Losing my hair was not pleasant BUT IT GROWS BACK QUICKLY! Take heart. It is so much fun when the stubble seems to grow so quickly into new fresh hair. In my case it came in curly but bright white. I almost rubbed a hole in my head from stroking my new hair! I had strangers stop me to say how much they liked my hair cut. When they asked who cut my hair, I usually told them it was my chemo cut. Within two months I had to have a shape cut because it was so shaggy. I had tram flap reconstruction at the time of mastectomy. Now I have a brand new nipple which is very realistic. It all seems to be part of feeling whole and normal again. The entire process was like a year out of my life for surgery and cure. Now I want to get on with life and put the cancer behind me forever. The fear and anxiety is worse than the treatment. There are good drugs to manage side effects from the chemo. Try to think of each day and each treatment as a step closer to being cured. I am not \"Polyanna\" in my philosophy of life. I was one scared puppy but I made it through. Now I sometimes feel that I don't have a clear cut goal like I did when in treatment. Arimidex is now the prescribed drug to keep the cancer from recurring. Long story, short answer: YOU CAN DO IT!",
