I wasn't even able to stand up or walk until 2 a.m. after surgery - I can't imagine going home that night. Hang in there - I hope you get some relief soon. My drain is still doing what it needs to do, but I'll post again as things progress on my end. ",

I hope you get some relief soon.  I scheduled an appt with my surgeon for Monday morning, too - my drains have finally slowed down enough to come out, and I can't wait to get that shower and sleep on my side again. My dark bruising is finally faded for the most part, just a few spots remain, so hopefully I won't get puffy again once the drains are out.  Keep us posted! I hope you're able to have a restful weekend.",

Luckily I was still in the hospital and the nurses worked all night to keep my drains from clogging and to change the bandages around my drain sites. The next morning the surgeon checked me and said he would make a decision to operate again or not around Noon, and when he came to check me at Noon, some of my swelling had started to subside and my drains were still working correctly, so I was able to come home.  The drain on that side has continued to work overtime ever since, and I have been diligent about making sure that it doesn't get clogged. The fluid in that drain has turned much darker red instead of getting clearer over time, as it normally should. When I saw the surgeon last week, he said that was because it was draining the hematoma and that it was old blood and okay.  I'm so sorry you're having to go through this! It sounds like yours is much worse than mine. I hope you get some relief soon.",

Mine is getting much better - I still have a hard lump where the hematoma was, and he said it will soften over time and disappear slowly. I also still have a few dark bruise-like areas but they're getting smaller every day. I feel so, so much better now though!",

I've read the odor is caused by bacteria, and the alcohol must have killed the bacteria better than soap. ",
