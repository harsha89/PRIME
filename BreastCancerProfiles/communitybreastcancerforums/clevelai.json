Let your doctor's, family and friends help you through this. It's okay of learn more about your cancer and treatment options but focus on staying positive and try to be patient with this process. I'm a doer so the waiting has been difficult or me. I've had to put my trust in others and know that it will be fine. Read, meditate, pray, talk, or do whatever will help you to be calm. Find the best doctors that you can and ask lots of questions. Find out what additional testing you'll need and them scheduled.",
