This is what i love about being in this club, all the words of support and understanding from all who know what I'm saying and how I'm feeling. I can't get enough of it, it's what we all need when dealing with \"The Beast\". I didn't mention it before but since my surgery the doctors and I have found another lump. This time in a node in my neck,so I'm seeing the oncologist next Wednesday. I had a biopsy done on it 2 weeks ago but the doctor who was performing it messed it up, and as I was already stressed out I had a melt down as it hurt so much. So I'm seeing a different oncologist and hope it'll go better this time. She's been recommended to me by my breast care nurse who does my Zoladex injection, and have been told she's very nice and very good. So my treatment may end up including chemo after all. Just have to wait and see. Just to let you all know too, I often join the chatroom so maybe I'll talk to some of you there sometime.",

As for my Mum and me starting and finishing on the same day, the people at the clinic were hoping to try and get some of our appts. together, but didn't workout that way. But as I have already been in a few times with mum I won't feel like a stranger, even though it still feels like a strange place where I don't feel I belong, especially mentally. Does that make sense? I'm glad you've included a photo of yourself but I've got to say you don't look very old. I'm 36. Your smile is a very warm one. But I just hope I get my head around it all soon so I can accept what's going on better, especially when I start rads.. But then again, alot that I've spoken to who've had or still have bc have said sometime you never get your head around it. I'll have to wiat and see.",

I'm not starting my rads. until 1st November, but that's almost Oct. just out by a day, so I hope I'm ok to add to the conversation. My Mum also has bc and will be finishing her rads. on the same day I start mine. I've been able to see what happens by watching her have the treatment. She's in her 5th week and now starting to have skin reactions and burning on the nipple. I had the call just a week ago telling me when I was starting rads. and til then I'd been handling things pretty well. But that call changed things for me and it's really hit me hard as to what I'm dealing with. I couldn't stop shaking after the call. I've had lots of surgeries in the past for different things, so the lumpectomy was just like another operation. Now it's really sunk it that I really do have cancer. So roll on the next chapter. I know it's going to be even rougher then the previous one.",

I don't believe there is any mass associated with my micros but I still had a birad 4 (not sure if it was a 4a, b or c was too scared to ask) I'll be out of town for a week so I won't know my results until next Friday. I met with a breast surgeon who told me not to panic yet. She said most micros are benign and if it's anything it's probably very early stage.

Because I have so many there\u2019s a certain one that might have been missed last year but they want to \u201cwatch and wait\u201d and check it again in 6 months She also said if I need peace of mind they would go ahead with a biopsy She said the \u201cnew guy\u201d doesn\u2019t look particularly troublesome or she would have ordered a biopsy right away (like last year with the calcifications) I feel like I would rather have the biopsy than have this in the back of my mind for the next 6 months.
