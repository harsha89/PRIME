      "Content": "holly77 wrote: Ok this is kind of concerning. I read this and from what I gather...I am at a slightly higher risk for breast cancer because I had a very large fibroadenoma removed. Is that true? Mortality/Morbidity Fibroadenomas are benign lesions and are not considered to have malignant potential. However, because they contain epithelium, a risk of neoplasia exists, as in other locations in the breast. The risk of a breast carcinoma occurring within a fibroadenoma is about 3%. Carcinoma is twice as likely to occur in women who have previously undergone excision of a fibroadenoma. The relative risk of carcinoma is increased in women who have fibroadenomas associated with cysts, sclerosing adenosis, calcifications, or papillary apocrine change. Juvenile fibroadenomas, otherwise called giant fibroadenomas, are rapidly growing benign tumors that occur in female adolescents. These tumors are cured with excision. Log in to post a reply",

I got into what in my town is called \"county indigent program\" they pay for just about everything. I had my surgery paid for plus mammograms and doc visits.

Yeah that is what worries me mostly because mine was so large and the radiologists report state that one my size has the chance of being cancerous. I go in tomorrow for a new diagnostic mammogram at 10am. I got my old films back and I haven't had one since Nov 2006. I had a recent ultrasoun done in 2007 though. Crossing my fingers that everything is still ok.",
