My scalp is still quite bald. I am getting very worried.. Some other posts that I have read state that hair growth started in a month.Is this an indication that I may be bald?",

My doctor thought I had mastitis until the ultrasound showed an abnormal finding. To make a long story short, a biopsy was done and I was diagnosed with cancer. I am not saying you have the disease, but as the old saying goes \"It is better to be safe than sorry\" Good luck to you",

Like you, I have no family history of this terrible disease. Yes, it is a shocker to be told on the phone that the biopsy is positive. You are not along here. I have posted when I have had problems or questions and these sisters helped me so much. They are so kind and caring. So, please don\"t hesitate to tells us what is going on or if you need to vent. It will get better. Cyber hugs to you",
