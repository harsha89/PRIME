One was 4cm and the other was 2cm and both were benign (praise God). I found a lump again two weeks ago and went in for my scheduled 6 month follow up ultrasound and sure enough it's back only this time the lump is 1cm. I suppose on the 19th the Doctor will tell me what he recommends but what if i want to be proactive and skip any other biopsy's and just get the darn thing out?? Is this something I can ask for or will i look ridiculous? Remember this is the 3rd. one in 6 mths and i have a family history of cancer. Dad died in 2000 of colon cancer, a aunt of breast cancer and i've had precancerous issues in my cervix. Please give me your opinion on what i should do? Isn't it better to be safe then sorry?? *lumpectomy - to ask for or not to?? Log in to post a reply",
