I am going to have to order something on my own with the help of the PT I am seeing to get one before I go out of my mind or get much bigger from not wrapping enough. Can't do a blasted thing with the bandages on or they get displaced somehow.  Probably due to the fact that my arm is so fatty due to obesity. Please, anyone with info. about the best products or tips for overweight persons with lymph., let me hear from you.  So far Jozu looks the best to me.  They have soft and lined fabri that is supposed to be very durable. With much empathy for you, Di, Denise ",
