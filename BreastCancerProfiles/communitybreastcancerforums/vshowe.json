      "Content": "vshowe wrote: I'm in the wrapping phase of treatment and I'm pretty much frustrated. So far, there hasn't been much improvement and my hand/fingers are worse. My PT told me that we may not have much success with my hand/fingers. Is that true? She tested my other arm with kinesio tape to see if I'd have an allergic reaction. I think tomorrow she is trying the tape. Has anyone used a reduction kit instead of wrapping every day? I have 2 young children and am getting increasingly frustrated with how little I can do while I'm wrapped. Right now I'm wrapped 24/7 and will eventually do it nightly after I get a sleeve. I'm having a hard time picturing myself doingthis nightly for the rest of my life. I know I'm whining and usually I'm very optimistic. I had TNBC 4.5 years ago. Im grateful for life. If you had swelling in the hands/fingers, I'd love to hear your success stories. Log in to post a reply",
