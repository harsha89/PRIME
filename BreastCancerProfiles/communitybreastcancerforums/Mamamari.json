Greetings sisters, Was diagnosed (finally!) 6/23 with IDC and DCIS both in different quadrants after large excisional biopsy.  Margins were not clean so we are going with unilateral Mastectomy of the right breast.  Sentinel nodes will be biopsied in surgery to determine if we can save the remaining nodes.

But I just can´t help but think what if I hate it! I´m sure I would hate either decision as how can we not..but I really think I will feel better being done with any future surgeries and not having anything foreign in my body.

Otherwise I managed just fine on my own and drove home immediately after. I also have a young child and we´re on our own most of the time (husband works away) so for me the hardest has been organizing my various appts. And keeping everything in one file has definitely been helpful...that way if I had forgotten a question in one visit I always had everything with me to reference it again. I also had been diagnosed with cysts...almost 3 yrs ago, last year they doubled in size...this year they´re triple (over golf ball size) with 3 different micro calc clusters within...my biopsy came back inconclusive and I just wasn´t satisfied they had managed to get the spot (long saga) so tomorrow it´s off to have it fully removed and then biopsied.  And even though I may be slightly anxious about the surgery, it is nothing in comparison to having this ´Thing´ out of my body and getting a 100% confirmation. You´ll need to assess how you feel once your results are in. Will be thinking of you...and feel free to send a private message if you´re in need! Uno Fuerta Abrazo! Mari ",

I ´ve had a large mass slowly growing for over 3 yrs, last year (in Canada) it was diagnosed as just cystic and nothing to worry about.  several weeks ago however I noticed bleeding and clear fluid leaking from one of my ducts (I´m still breast feeding) so back to a new Gyno, who immediately sent me for a new Mammo and ultrasound with a specialist, he immediately recommended biopsy.  My Dr. wasn´t too confident in the system here on the Island and wanted to send me to either London, Barcelona or Germany. My insurance however had other ideas and said no..it would have to be done locally. Through a week of banging my head against the wall and trying to figure out insurance and who to even call I finally found a breast pathologist who agreed to see me immediately. Well he took one look at my chart and scheduled me in for the core biopsy the next day.  I haven´t even had time to look for information on what this all is. He took approx. 7 samples (leaving me stinging and bruised) but otherwise it wasn´t too bad. I think the worst was having it done in the OR so waiting on the gurney outside without a hand to hold and then being wheeled into the OR room and looking up at those massive lights and thinking just how real this is. He´s said he´ll have the results in 1 week and in the mean time sent me for chest X-rays and an ultrasound of my liver and kidneys as well as some additional blood work and a trip to another hospital to book an MRI (Nothing is done for you or sent to your Dr here, you must pick up all your results, get your insurance authorizations, and book all appts even though you don´t have a clue what your booking..It´s doing my head in!)  I feel like I haven´t had a chance to even breath and I´m freaked but trying to be optimistic. I´m fortunate to have very good friends rallying around to support me and help with childcare etc. But it is hard to think that I may get bad news and not have my husband there with me if I do. To top it off I think (though I may be getting lost in translation) that my Doc is telling me that even if it is B9 we may still have to treat it with Chemo to shrink it and remove the breast  Understandably it is the size of a small lemon Not exactly small. Just waiting and hoping and trying not to freak out and let the docs run over me and not even sure where to start in making decisions for myself. I think I´ve also read that you cannot do an MRI on a lactating breast??? Sorry for the rambles just needed to get it out there!  I'm pretty sure I didn't send you an invitation! ...

He hadn´t even done the biopsy yet and surely he wouldn´t just let that spill out without some kind of sensitivity and preparation?!?!? Just thoroughly confused.  ",

I think I´m just angry at the moment, I first found the lump 3 yrs ago in my final months of pregnancy. Dr´s diagnosed cyst, 2 yrs later...4 times the size and docs still said nothing to worry about, I was still breastfeeding so they just brushed it off and said to get it checked when I finished feeding no big deal. 3 yrs later it´s the size of half my breast and yes I´m still feeding...now I read up that hyperplasia usually grows due to a trigger and can subside once the trigger is removed.  So I´m sitting here thinking that perhaps the extended breastfeeding was actually the trigger and if I had been told any of this a year ago I would have stopped and not let it get this far. As now all of the tests are showing highly suspicious characteristics which were not there a year ago.   I´m definitely going to the mat with this as I feel my 1st Doc really just went in stabbing blind and probably biopsied the mass of cysts that we knew were there...and not what was new and lighting up the screens! So I would prefer the 100% result route! Does anyone out there have any experience with a lumpectomy / excisional biopsy of this size, I know nothing about quadrants but am pretty sure it fills 3/4 of my lower breast with additional lumps closer to the chest wall on both sides of it. I´m wondering what I should expect. ",

Sorry I have been off this thread and out of it for some months as I went through my surgeries (1 for the excisional Lumpectomy, 1 for the right Mastectomy, and the 3rd to remove the lymph nodes) then it was recovery time and onto the Chemo train.  Just going through it all now and trying to keep my head looking forward. SO glad you were able to catch it so early and I am certainly a firm believer that if it ain't working get it out and find out why!!! Zymurgist, glad to here you qualify for the program, good luck.",

I have opted for NO reconstruction...ever..asking my BS to make it as flat and clean as possible.  Having some major anxiety attacks now...I thought I was sure about this decision, I´ve been pretty strong and focused so far. But I just can´t help but think what if I hate it! I´m sure I would hate either decision as how can we not..but I really think I will feel better being done with any future surgeries and not having anything foreign in my body. I need some encouragement, and some words of hope that someday I will learn to live with this decision and this new form. Wishing none of us were here, but grateful you are.
