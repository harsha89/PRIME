I start my first chemo treatment tomorrow.  Am starting to worry more and more.  I went for my cat scans today and had an allergic reaction to the dye.  I broke out in hives and my face was so swollen.  I was taken to the ER by ambulance and was given so much Benadryl that I can barely keep my eyes open so I should have no problem sleeping tonight.  Hopefully there won't be any unexpected reactions to any of the chemo drugs tomorrow.  Sherri K",

My day was extremely long yesterday.  I was informed by my oncologist the night before chemo that my Her2 test came back positive at the last minute so my meds had to be changed from TAC to TCH x 6 and Herceptin x 12.  Unfortunately the nurses were not aware of the change so I had to wait for the Onc to get in before my treatment could get started.  Was there for about 10 1/2 hours.  The only side effect that I have this morning is a slight sore throat and my face and chest look like I have a bad sunburn.  Has anyone else had a problem with redness?   Sherri K",
