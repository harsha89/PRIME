Mostly radiation has been pretty tolerable but I'm lobster red and have the texture of a basketball. I'm starting to be pretty dang sore in some areas especially under my arm where my bra rubs (very loose sports bra) I figured out this morning that if I put one of the gauze pads I had left over from the mastectomy under my bra it feels SO much better.
