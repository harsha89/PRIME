It's sad that society is driven by who's popular, beautiful or sexy. It seems like more pple will do what celebs tell them to do if they haven't been personally affected I remember after I was diagnosed some people didn't know how to deal with me. My ex left. It was too real. I worked during my chemo & had discussions with a few women, who had that \"sorry for your loss\" face on. But you knew it went in one and out the other. My boss had taken a mammo & they called her back. Even after knowing of my surgery & seeing me struggle through chemo & my constant pleading with her to go back, she kind of shrugged it off. But the moment she found out Angelina Jolie had been proactive after after testing positive for the gene my boss went into overdrive \"OMG Ann did you hear about Angelina, she's my fav. I can't believe she had a bilateral, what bravery. I called and made my appt because if it could happen to her who the hell am I?\" I was dumbfounded. She knew every step of my journey &even with that Angelina had more of an impact on herðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³. It's like pple put them above others like demigods or something It's sad but it's the world we live in. So many pple came up to me in awe over Angelina's bravery. Same pple avoided me prior. I guess if a celeb can get them talking and donating I can deal with it. My job has a BC fundraiser every Oct & pple donations are more when they hear about a star with it. Nevermind that there are 3 of us in the office. Must save those A, B, C listers. Â Smh",

I work full time and was told that I should be able to work uninterrupted as this is considered Chemo Light. From what I've read, you do lose some hair, but it's more like thinning. The hair isn't what really scares me, as so many women w/o cancer wears, wigs and weaves so if I have to be added to the list so be it. Most of the celebrities out there wear wigs or add in weaves for thickness..My major concerns are the other side effects. I'm a single mom and can not afford to lose too many days at work. I've already taken 6 weeks for my bilaterial and I don't have much sick/vacation leave left until our year end in April. Being that it's every 3 weeks, I initially plan on going Thursdays and taking the Friday off because from what I'm reading the side effects are not immediate, they're like 2-3 days later. I may push the infusions day to Wednesday if I feel good the next day. It's still a work in progress. Robin3 I hope all is well with you and I hope someone who has gone through this can comment. I will definitely be checking in later this week to let you know how it goes.. Good Luck",

I feel the same way you do and I haven't yet gotten over not having my own breast. I must say the results are looking good though. I was terrified on the day of surgery. After my plastic surgeon and Breast surgeon marked me up, I was ushered off to surgery. I woke to pain, but I had a pain pump. I must say waking up to lady lumps (fake or not) helped me keep my sanity. I was tightly wound up with bandages. I stayed in the hospital for 2 days. My under arms were swollen and that whole area was painful. Thank God for percocets. I'm so grateful for this board. THe women kept saying \"Make sure you stay ahead of the pain\" Some women were able to just take tylenol (I have no idea how they did it) I wasn't one of those women. I was in pain. If possible get a recliner (with a remote control) I slept in that because pushing off the bed was unthinkable. So I basically took my pain meds and although it seemed like years at the time, it really wasn't that long of a period of time for the pain. I came home Friday & was off to my PS on Monday. My aunt drove. I didn't drive for 3 weeks because backing up... OMG.. no no.. Washing your hair initially is tough, because lifting your hands over your head isn't fun. Â You can't really lift much. But if you have people to help it's not so bad. About a week later I was much better. Some pain, but I eased off the percocets until night. I slept in my recliner for 2 weeks (I didnt have one, but I rented one from Rent A Center..) Â For about 3 weeks I thought all was lost and was depress, but I can tell you week 3 did it for me!!! I started feeling like myself. Driving, my swelling was down drastically. The drains were out..They didn't look like rocks. 6 months out, the \"Foobies\" have settled and they look youthful and decent. I was unable to keep my nipples, so I look like Barbie. I have to wait until after chemo to get them. I have a few touch ups that need fat but I'm actually impressed.Â  I understand your anger. I'm still angry. I have no feeling what so ever. They get cold to touch if it's chilly out.. It's my new Â normal, but it's doable considering the alternative..Â  Good Luck Ann",
