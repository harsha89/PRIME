Have been using it for 2 years. Amazing...I am now afraid to even nap without it. Sleep better and now, no more falling asleep or feeling constantly exhaused during the days. I don't know who invented the idea...but I love mine. For many years I woke up everyday with a headache, dry mouth & sore throat. As soon as I started using the C-pap the chronic head-aches and mouth problems went away.",

Did not start Herceptin until a year later. My dx will have been 5 years ago as of 9/21. Was dx with IDC but I still believe it was IBC. The tumor was actually very tiny (less than 2cm) but aggressive, yet I had extreme external symptoms (flu-like feeling for almost 3 months, painful enlarged breast, red ,hot, inflammed skin over entire breast) Had neg mammo after symptoms began and was specifically told it was not IBC. Several drs insisted I had mastititis or dermatitis. Currently NED as far as breast cancer. Have had other major health problems, but not breast cancer related. KerryMac...thanks for posting the link to that article. It was informative and encouraging.Michele, hang in there and think positive. Treatments keep getting better and better and also much easier to tolerate. Sounds like 10-20 years ago we would have had little hope for long term survival. Every day is a gift!",

However I did survive with-out major intervention, regained strength and some stamina and came home. Then last year I went in for a minor hernia repair. On the spur of the moment, just before I went to the OR, I changed that DNR to FULL CODE. Well, I had a respiratory arrest in recovery and ended up on a vent for 1 week and in ICU. However, I have fully recovered from that incident, live by myself, care for myself and am happy & content despite being somewhat worse for wear.I still have quality of life and much joy. I would not do another DNR unless I have enrolled in Hospice or Palliative care. If I had not changed my DNR status just before that last surgery, they would have \"let me go\".",

It is rare that the patient has to pick them up and hand carry them.Most Docs are not specialist at reading the films, though they do often want to see them. The Docs can order the films, if they need them. If the hospital and Dr are connected in any way, the films might even be available to them through their on-line system. It is poissible and likely that even the OB/GYN will refer you to a surgeon for evaluation, and that would be normal. That still does not necessairly mean you have Cancer. The OB/GYN is a good place to start. Some of the bigger hospitals and OB/GYN practices have their own social workers that help women get \"connected\" to the appropriate services. It would not hurt to call and ask is they have a Maternal health social worker that could please call you back to help you navigate the system. ",

I had gone to a Social Worker because I felt so overwhelmed and burdened financially and was literally living on credit cards. It never occured to me that any funds would be offered. That thousand dollars was really appreciated, but I too have wondered if many women actually get enough financial help to be able to get the care they need or lift the burden much. I have 5 daughters and a niece that have participated in the 3 Day numerous times and together have raised 10s of thousands for the Komen Foundation. I too would like to know more about how the money is divided up and think this should be researched a little more and the results posted as I am sure it is Public Info. I will see what I can find out...unless someone reading this already has the info.",

Interesting correlations between the high rate of breast cancer in women who are the fixing, caring, nurturing type and those that tend to take on the emotional pain and stress of others: ie nurses etc. There have also been ongoing studies/correlation between those who work the grave yard shift and their melatonon levels. Most night jobs for women are in nursing.",
