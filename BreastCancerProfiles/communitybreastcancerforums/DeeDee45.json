I was told to not eat any raw vegetables/fruits I could not peel, stay away from anyone that was ill and to practice good hand washing hygiene. No other instructions/information.  I know to call my onc if I spike a fever, but what else do I need to know? How long will it take for my immune system to rebound? Should my counts be checked before my next appt which is two weeks from now?  Should I attend my grandchilds birthday party tomorrow? Should I go to church, shopping, etc?  Thanks for any and all advice.
