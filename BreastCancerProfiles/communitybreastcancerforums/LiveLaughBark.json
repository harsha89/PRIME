    "Content": "LiveLaughBark wrote: I went in two weeks ago for a routine breast reduction and today they told me that I have ALH and I need to see an oncologist/breast specialist.I am floored!No family history of any kind of cancer.I am 46 and have had mammograms since I was 28 due to the size of my (previous) breasts. I don\u2019t know what to think or how to process.I take Hormone Replacement therapy because I had a complete hysterectomy 3 years ago.I want to stop taking the pills because of this diagnosis and my concern that the estrogen is doing this to me.However, I don\u2019t want to be in menopause and sweaty and moody and unable to sleep, etc. Just confused how this all is happening.Any information anyone can give me on how to cope and approach the oncologist would be appreciated.
