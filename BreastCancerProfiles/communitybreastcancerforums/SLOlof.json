Surgery (lumpectomy- and I'm still not sure that's the best option) scheduled for Tuesday the 8th, but I'm going for a second opinion Friday the 4th.  That's cutting it close but it was the first available appointment at Dana  Farber. I'm wishing you all the best of luck and am so glad this community exists. ",
