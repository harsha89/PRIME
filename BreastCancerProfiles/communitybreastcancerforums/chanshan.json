After 11 x-rays and three ultrasounds that day the radiologist said my original lump was nothing but they found a fibroadenoma. Is this something I should get a biopsy of or just take his word for it? I go to my regular doctor Friday, is there anything I should be asking him? Any advice is always appreciated!!!
