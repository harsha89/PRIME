Your wife is almost a 2 yr survivor.  You are right, with so many good treatments & more coming all the time this is much more a chronic disease.  If the Arimidex stops being effective at some point there are many, many other treatment options -- all very good.  I just celebrated 7 yrs since diagnosis in June 2001.  I've been stage Iv since 9/02 when bone mets were found.  I've been on several different treatments over the years. I'm still stable, still strong, and planning to be around for many many more years. ",

On that I was able to lose weight & keep it off. I still need to lose 15-20 more pounds and am now concerned that I'll be gaining weight back.

I'm hoping i can get into it when it opens.   It is sponsored by Genentech.  LuAnn -- great consice list of meds.  I'm going to copy that for future reference. Thanks. Jordan",

Next week I start taxol & avastin.  Taxol 3 wks on, 1 wk off.  Avastin every other week. I had 4 cycles of taxol years ago (3weeks apart) & thought it was terrible -- lots of bone pain, neuropathy.  I don't know if the weekly will be easier.  I dread having to be in the dr. office on IV every week again.  I really dread having to lose my hair (for the 3rd time).  I dread having to tell my 2 sons (31 & 28) who both are so scared they freak out & I can't handle that on top of everything else.  I dread not knowing how I'll do on this chemo.... will it work? how will I feel? What's going on inside my body that the scans don't show?  I also have pleural effusions -- they developed from a side effect of taxotere about 5 yrs ago.  They were really bad & I had them drained.  They tested the fluid then & no sign of cancer - said it was likely the taxotere effect on me.  They've never completely gone away, altough have been small.  Now I'm worried that's why the tumor marker is rising that there's cancer there maybe.  I forgot to ask the dr. today what he thought about that.  I know there are people on this site who are on taxol avastin so I will look for your posts.  But any help you can add here on that chemo, effusions, etc.  I thank you for listening.

At home.... I'm divorced so all the financial & living stuff is on me.  Right now my son, his fiance & their 10 month old baby (my grandson!) are living with me.  You'd think that would be a help, but it sort of makes more work & definitely more hectic.  I don't know how long term it will be.  If they'd do more projects for me it would be great, but the reality is that's not happening.  It is a wonderful day brightener to have this little sweet baby to love & laugh with~",
