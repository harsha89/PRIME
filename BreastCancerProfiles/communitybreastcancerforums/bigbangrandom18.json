I've seen obgyn specialist for this and he did not seem to care too much about it but I insisted to get 3D ultrasound and it came out normal. I did not do the mammo because the radiologist I met told me I am not meeting the age requirement yet. I met another physician and he did the pituitary hormone blood test, it came out normal too. I am not taking any medication either I tried not to squeeze, maybe once in a month or two just to see if I still have the discharge and I did... then I saw it had this tiny scab on top of the single duct, and when I squeezed it out. I saw blood discharge I am scared to death now... please help me. I am worried sick to my stomach. I don't know what to do.. Log in to post a reply",
