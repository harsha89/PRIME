But received negative results to all. But I\u2019m still not convinced. Anyone else just know something is wrong? My right nipple itched like crazy for a few days a couple weeks ago. Beginning of last week my right breast gradually got more sore. Last Tuesday I woke up with severe deep pain and 2 red spots approx size of a nickle around my aerola and a dimpling in my aerola. My breast was hot to the touch. I showed my PCP on Wednesday gave me antibiotics just in case and I finished them yesterday. In the last week the red spots have gone away but I have developed a heaviness, pulling, aching, itching, shooting pains, the shape of my breast has changed slightly, it feels differently when touched like the consistency, and toward my armpit is swollen. When my arms are at my sides I feel like my arm sticks out. Also, I have swollen lymph bones above my clavicle and jaw. Not to mention lots of fatigue. I went for my mammogram today. They did both sides. Then called me for an ultrasound of both breasts. They said I\u2019m clear on the right but found a lump that is just a lymph node of the left and that they will see me when I\u2019m 40. Help! I still don\u2019t have peace! I\u2019m still feel Iike something is wrong. Anyone else not relieved? Am I crazy Log in to post a reply",
