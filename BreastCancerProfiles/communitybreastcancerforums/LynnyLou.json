    "Content": "Sep 5, 2011 11:08AM LynnyLou wrote: Hi Irfortuna, I had implants for approx 7 years prior to my first BC in right breast (also DCIS).  I had a lumpectomy and six weeks of external radiation.  My radiation oncologist said the radiation would most likely not have any effects on my implant.  However, I ended up with a capsular contracture on the radiated side and had both implants replaced and the scar tissue cleaned out a little over a year after finishing radiation treatment. I didn't have any more problems with the capsular contracture.  Last year I was diagnosed with BC again, this time in left breast.  I had a BIMX with TE last August and silicone implants placed in December.  The right, previously-radiated side didn't expand as well as the left side, but my plastic surgeon said it's always \"iffy\" when dealing with radiated skin, and he was pleased that my skin and muscle expanded as well as it did.   Good luck with your upcoming surgery (whatever it turns out to be).  I agree with Leah...a second consult is always a good idea, and you might want consider a consult with a plastic surgeon experienced with reconstruction too. ",
