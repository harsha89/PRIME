Bilateral mastectomy, Stage 1A, no nodes involved, no chemo or radiation, oncotype score 3, ER/PR positive. I was diagnosed in May 2014 and have been on Arimidex since then. I have side effects(joint and muscle pain) and have also developed osteopenia and an area of almost osteoporosis. Just had my first injection of Prolia yesterday. The first year seemed to be the most worry filled. I still sometimes have days where I am filled with worry and dread. Those days are getting further apart. I realize that I am very fortunate and the potential for recurrence is low. In a lot of ways my diagnosis opened up new things for me. Things and experiences that I probably would have not done or put off for the future. I bought a horse! I ride 3-4 days a week. It brings me great joy and I am more fearless than I was before my diagnosis. I hope things will get easier for you! You have done everything possible to rid your body of bc and you are in treatment with tamoxifen. My neighbor has a long term survival story. She was diagnosed in 2002. Lumpectomy, radiation and 5 years of tamoxifen. She is active and healthy in her early 70's :) Wishing you the best!",
