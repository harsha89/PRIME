I did wear the post-mastectomy camisoles by Amoena, but the one I got had this band for adhering the drain pockets that really bothered me. So I used the binding more or just ribbed tanks that I already had. I'm small so it worked. I also bought some padded/built in bra tanks from Uniqlo. There's no pocket, but I'm small enough to make my left (uni on left) work without any stuffing. I did get fitted last week and have wore the bra with the foob, it was so expensive and I\u2019m glad insurance covered it. I can only wear it for a couple of hours before I start to feel bothered by it. I went read on another thread about Coobie bras and bought a set from Amazon. They are pretty comfy. No hooks, they pull over. I also don't need to put my foob in those. So in short, I think it is better to wait for the silicone prosthetic. HTH Night Owl",

In surgery they looked at the sentinel nodes and determined no invasion, but the final path included a more thorough review where they specifically looked at the known lesions (where the markers were placed post-biospies. I had two, so two markers). But they slice up the entire breast tissue and look at it section by section. At least that is what was done at the academic hospital I went to for my uni mx. I am meeting with the pathologist to review my slides and ask additional questions. I requested the meeting because while they say not to worry, there was a line in my final path about how some desmoplasia in some areas makes it challenging to exclude invasion in those areas, but no invasion was found. I want to understand that more. You can check your insurance to see if they will cover a meeting with your pathologist or at least ask to speak to them on the phone. Good luck. Night Owl",

Was there any micro invasion? Is there any info that will impact your treatment moving forward? What\u2019s the hormone status of the tissue, what are the margins near the chest wall? Sure there\u2019s the known area, but the imaging doesn\u2019t pick up everything and biopsies only test a very small amount of tissue. Like if you pinched off a piece of raisin nut bread you might get a tiny bit of raisin. Also, imagine slicing bread with nuts or raisins. Each slice and cross section won\u2019t necessarily have a nut or raisin bit/piece, which is why you want them to study the whole breast. That\u2019s how my surgeon explained it so we understood. . . I hope you find answers you need. Night Owl",

I'm small. Have had luck with MX bras and stuff I find with removable pads at Nordstrom Rack. The Shimera brand at the Rack also sells inserts that work for bathing suits in my case. They are in the lingerie section. Sometimes I just wear the insert instead of my prosthesis. Heres' my question. Six months ago I noticed a moveable pea sized lump at the edge of my scar. Still there. Sometimes tender. Onc says it is scar tissue and it is normal to have tenderness and pain for years out. . . has this been the case for you? Twinges near your scar? Pea sized scar tissue at the edge of MX scar? (near my arm pit) I don't have twinges per se, but when I press on the thing it sometimes feels tender. Took the last two weeks of messaging, but finally my Onc put in an order to have an US of both sides. Anyone have an US of your flat side? So far I've had the good side monitored every six months. . . My appt is next week. Thanks for thoughts. . . Night Owl",
