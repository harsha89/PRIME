The area that was supposedly 5 CM on my report is actually 5 MMs!! What a difference!! The procedure went very well. Lots of in and out of the MRI. The staff was amazing, so supportive, funny and sweet. It wasn't a big deal. My friend and I went out to lunch after and now I'm home icing my boob and filling you all in. Just waiting til Tuesday for the results. I plan to relax, not worry and think good thoughts. Will post when I know more. XO",

Things at the breast specialist did not go so smoothly today. She wants to have a surgical biopsy of the breast to remove the tissue in question and ascertain with 100% certainty that it is not cancer. She believes with 92-98% certainty that it is nothing but she questions, \"Why do I have scar tissue in my breast?\" I haven't had any surgery, accidents or hard bites on my boob since 2008 (my last mammogram) to cause this. She also is concerned about the calcifications on the left side of my boob. She doesn't like the looks of my mammogram (same thing the sonogram radiologist said). I feel very frustrated. I thought I was at the end of the line with this. I thought I had the all clear. And to find out that she wants to take a \"grape sized\" biopsy out of my boob (which is already super angry about the little baby biopsy they did before -- very swollen and has a large hematoma, she said). If she takes a grape, I won't have much left! I told her that and she said, \"We're not talking about a clump of grapes here, just one!\" It would be a big huge deal, like put in some wire, get a mammogram, have IV sedation, do the surgery, have two layers of sutures.  I'm just not into it. I think surgeons like to \"surge\" and my boob doesn't want anymore \"surging.\" I'm thinking of just waiting for my 6 month mammogram, but she pulled the \"you're young, you're a young mother. You want to rule everything out and be sure\" thing.  But do I? I'm not so sure. I get that we have all this technology and it's so great to find if there's a problem but maybe in this case we're just hunting down something that doesn't exist. For what? 100% certainty? There's no guarantee that I'm going to go pick my kids up from school and not get hit by a drunk driver. Or be blasted out of my office building by an airplane. Or be gunned down at the Taco Bell by some crazy pissed off former employee. Any opinions out there? PS - Thanks for listening to my rantings and ventings :) I'm feeling upset...",

I especially love \"There are many women on these boards that are facing much more serious circumstances.\" That totally puts it into perspective. While I am frustrated that at each step, I think I am at the end, and then there is more...others are in much more dire circumstances. I am grateful for you sending me that feedback, Claire! XO I spoke with my husband and we looked at the report together and I noticed that on the report it says \"recommend excision of entire lesion.\" So, it's not just the surgeon's perspective, it's the perspective of the pathologist who analyzed the sample. My husband feels strongly that I need to get the surgery for his peace of mind. He's a very level headed, logical, decisive guy and I'm so glad I have him in my life (to help me in the midst of all my hair brained schemes!) I plan to move ahead with the surgery and will let you all know when that's scheduled. Thanks for listening to my \"freak out\" and helping me with perspective and advice. It means the world to me.

They received my biopsy and it is \"perfectly benign.\" Yay!!  I have an appointment with a breast specialist tomorrow, ostensibly to receive the results, but will keep the appointment to find out: what is it? what should my follow up care be? and any other details she would like to share. Just a quick note that on Saturday, my boob swelled up like a crazy thing and stressed me out in a big way. I ended up going to the urgent care center and the doctor there said that was a perfectly normal reaction to a biopsy. He said that I had internal bleeding that caused a hematoma, so basically the blood was swelling up my boob. It hurt a lot but has decreased a lot by today. I wish someone from the MRI center had indicated that that could be a reasonable outcome of the biopsy; it would have saved me some anxiety. Maybe someone on here can benefit from this knowledge... In any case, I wish you all the best on this board. It has been so lovely to come here and vent, share, laugh, cry with you ladies. I will be thinking of all of you and wishing you all love and light. Love lots, Lucy",

I need laughter in my life!! :) So tomorrow morning is my biopsy. I watched a video of it last night on youtube and it encouraged me to take a Xanax like I did last time. It's like an 1½ hour procedure! Eek!! Luckily my friend Mary Beth is taking me so I can take Xanax and still be a safe driver. And my husband Michael is taking me to see the breast specialist on Tuesday to get the results. He jokingly said he's going with me to keep all the Audi's safe, but it'll be soooo nice to have him there whatever the result! Speaking of my husband, he grew up in Albuquerque and went to El Dorado and UNM. His parents just sold their house at the base of the Sandias last year and moved to Orlando. My kids are psyched cause we get to visit Disney and Universal Studios, but I miss Albuquerque. So nice to have a connection. Thanks for sending me light on my journey. I send you light as well and all my best wishes for a positive outcome.",
