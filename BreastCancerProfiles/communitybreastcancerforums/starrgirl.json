Wish I could \"feed off\" those of you that are enjoying your walks!  I give all of you that are still working huge KUDOS.  I've been off work since my lumpectomy surgery March 2nd and will have to be taking long term disability.  I'm a teacher for students with severe disabilities and because of their weakened immune systems they have a tendency to get sick easier which would then get me sick.  Miss my students like crazy though!! Good luck to those visiting the bar today and tomorrow and hoping everyone has a great weekend.  I'm looking forward to moving my daughter back home from college!! :)",

My mom and dad took me today so I enjoyed visiting with them. SE that I have been experiencing is extreme bone pain in legs, hips and back that start on day 2 and continue through day 6. Been taking norco for the pain. Appetite has been better and experiencing no nausea. MO said today that with my good counts two weeks post chemo I will probably start radiation a couple weeks after last chemo. I'm definitely ready to move on. Applied for and received LTD so I'm hoping to be back to work in Sept. Good luck to those ladies going in tomorrow and the rest of the week. May you have minimal SE. Thank you for all of your support and valuable information.",

Took about 2 hours total and it went well. Ate some crackers and cheese during my treatment and drank water, which I feel helped. Once home I appear to have a dry mouth and a slight headache. The nurse mentioned that when administered C can cause headaches and sinus pressure. Only noticed a slight headache during the infusion but it's continuing at home so taking Tylenol. Will also be taking my anti-nausea medicine tonight and tomorrow. Back for my shot tomorrow afternoon. Thankful to have 1 done.......7 more to go! EBeee - Love the Easter picture!! Ankledolphin - My infusion nurse today mentioned that if Claritin and over the counter Tylenol don't help that my MO could order a prescription for me. She also mentioned that they could adjust to only 1/2 shot each time too. beachbum102 - Margarita and pina colada popsicles..........DELISH! I'm on the hunt for some tomorrow. Hope everyone has a great week with little to no SE. WE CAN DO THIS!!!!!!",

I did pick up my wig this week.  It's the same color and length but straighter with looser curls.  Thinking about getting a big straw hat for the summers here in Michigan. Thank you all for being a great sounding board and source of information.  I don't get on here very often but know that I think about and pray for each of you daily. Cherie  ",
