It's the 3rd or 4th day in that s/e kick in, right? Do you plan to work through your treatment or just take it as you can? Hopefully your partners in crime will keep you laughing and otherwise occupied. Your in my prayers and wI'll look forward to hearing how your days do. Thanks for the info on the port tomorrow, been a bit nervous about it but at least I get drugs :) Jeanelle aka Zolagirl",

They say strength is in numbers and I can tell you, it sure helps having people around....no one should feel alone during something like this. So Thanks to all of you!!! I had my 1st A/C treatment Friday afternoon. Not going to lie, I was scared shit less the days leading up, especially the night before. Ativan has become my friend. My fiance just started a new job a week after my diagnosis, so we have to pick n choose what appts he can make, but I went and saw my work family on the way to appt, my closest work friend took me and stayed with me all day ( this is important ladie's, take someone who can make you laugh, tell stories, keep you talking...for me, it was huge!) The nurses at my treatment center are so kind and amazing, ask questions all the way through...gives you a sense of some control) Tx itself went fine for me. My port is still tender and sore so that was truly the worst part. Infusions take time, IV anti-anxiety first, then anti nausea, and steroid. Cytoxan followed with the nurse giving the red adriamycin last. That was hard to watch going in and I chewed ice chips while it was infused ( some say it helps with mouth sores...I'll try anything to kept them away!!!!) My friend told me to think of the red stuff as lava that's flowing in and wiping out the cancer cells...so that's what I did, and I got through it fine....you all will too!!! After going home I just had a bad headache for a day, probably stress induced, and a teensy bit of nausea Saturday afternoon which sucking on ginger candies helped..been able to eat okay and no other issues so far. Keeping toes n fingers crossed. Will keep you posted on day 3 (tomorrow) and 4, as I know those are usually the ones to watch for.... Thinking of all of you to come behind me and I hope that we all have as gentle of a ride through this as we can...much love, Zolagirl",

My insurance won't cover the neulasta, so I get to self inject for 10 days following treatment. Pharmacy had a problem getting them in, so I am just going to do day 2 yet tonight. Taking Claritin as suggested to avoid bone pain...please say a little prayer as I will for all of you...I think I can handle most s/e, but not mouth or bone pain, please!!!! Newt72 - we do have almost exact diagnoses, don't we? Will be interesting to see how we do on this journey together....port tomorrow still? Do you have a chemo start date yet? You can ask me anything along the way ðŸ˜Š Showmama - how did your oncology appt go? Tlgio - Yep I admit it, i was terrified and scared is completely normal, we are facing a lot of unknowns! We are forced to look mortality in the face and have to be okay with getting toxins in our bodies and dealing with so many side effects that we MIGHT get, but are serious stuff! I usually try to keep things inside and deal on my own, but if I can give any advice....let friends and family in. Having my friend there for my first treatment made it so less scary, and it helped to take someone who was joking and upbeat..Do I need that every time? Probably not, but it was a tremendous comfort that first day! Journey - All I can say is, I LOVE your attitude!!!! Your posts are awesome to read, and I hope you continue to keep so upbeat! SweatyBetsy - one down.....yay!!!!! That first day is soooo overwhelming and I don't know about you, but alot of the information was things I knew to expect or to ask about after reading so much on this wonderful forum. The nurses said they can give us info and empathize as they've seen many women walk our shoes, but even they truly don't know our experiences unless they've gone through it themselves. I'm still trying to digest everything and I've read ALOT. You got this! Jens74 - glad to hear day 6 is better, I got the nausea on day 5 too....hmm. must mean tomorrow is gonna be good! Illimae - so sorry about your scary reaction!! At least now they know what to watch for and will hopefully have you going on a plan B soon. I definately smiled reading about the surgeon who did your port...how did you stop from giggling throughout? FCancer - I'm sorry about your delay in treatment, but most important is that you are well enough to receive the meds....it's especially hard when you get yourself mentally psyched up and then to get that news ðŸ˜• it sounds like you're doing everything you can to try and keep the germs at bay, but what can you do when those little suckers want to attach on? I know our area is seeing lots of nasties going around right now. Just get healthy so you're ready next week! M0221 - where have you been? Are you doing okay? Let us know......",

I'm sorry for the issues with your steroid and hope you can get that adjusted so that your s/e stay somewhat under control. Hope your headache is better too....those things are miserable! Hound your doc and get that nausea under control....my doc said there are many different meds to try that anymore, nausea is one of the s/e that is easiest to get a handle on....who knows if that's true, but I liked how it sounded when she told me that ðŸ˜Š Get some sleep so your body can fight!!

It looks like we have very similar diagnoses ( except that i am ER/PR+) And identical treatment plans. I am one treatment ahead of you and will have my 2nd AC dose this Thursday....You can do this, as we all can together! We are all taking baby steps along the way of this big giant road ahead of us, but as my close friend keeps telling me, no one is assured the next day, that's why you live and love life and take it one day at a time! I had to pull myself out of my funk to listen to her, but it really is so true. And getting through my first chemo treatment was a huge weight lifted, the fear of the unknown really can be our worst enemy. Reading about and talking to others who have gone through this, and having support of a wonderful medical staff have made the fear, and the side effects, much more manageable. Oh yes, and a bottle of Ativan to ease anxiety at times helps too!",

Have a great time and try to put bc on the back burner for the night! I don't know about Zyrtec, my oncologist nurse said they aren't even sure why Claritin seems to work, but for many it does. I started my daily Granix shots daily 3 days ago, am using Claritin, and seem okay so far. I signed up for the Look Good, Feel Better class, mine is Monday, so I'll let everyone know how that went....anybody else taken the class yet? I ordered the bangs from Amazon to wear with caps, but I don't typically have bangs and they didn't work for me, but they are very real looking...hope they work for you, Lilo! I still haven't decided on a wig, hairpiece (halo) or scarves yet...I did buy some cute winter caps/ and Chemobeanies on Amazon to try....I guess I better decide since I'm 7 days into treatment and they said hair loss starts around 2 weeks and can be very fast! Ugh! Hopefully this class will help me. Hope everyone has a good weekend and is feeling good enough to get out and enjoy it....Freaking freezing here, 6Â° right now, so a warm, cozy blanket and a movie is in my futureâ˜º",

At least you are treating yourself well with a new car ðŸ˜‰ did you find something you like? I thought I had accepted to the fact I am going to lose my hair, and while it hasn't started coming out yet, (I'm day 9 of 1st AC Treatment) I woke up this morning to several red sore bumps on my scalp and had another fricken cry fest. I think we will all have to go through the emotions many times for all the weird (and distressing) things happening to our bodies. And while I am so fortunate to have a completely supportive and loving boyfriend, they are men and don't quite get the devastation of losing so much of what makes us a woman. He continues to tell me he will love me \" hairless, boob less and even toothless\" and I truly believe him, but it doesn't make it easier to accept. It's still a mourning process. As far as drinking water, yes!!! Plain water has turned yucky to me, I do alot of flavored Vitamin water, and ginger ale too. I like the idea of cherry juice and may have to get some next time I'm in Trader Joe's. Since we got another round of snow last night, may not be anytime soon...lol. Enjoy your Sunday.",
