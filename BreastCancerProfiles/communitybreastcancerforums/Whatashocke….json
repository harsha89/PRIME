He has been wonderful but it was a big step and I appreciated his honesty. I had previously clipped it but it was falling out like crazy and the prickles were painful. I remember last Christmas at this time as we have a family picture as out home page and he makes me sad to compare the difference. If this is a short detour in a long destination like it has been for you than I know I can DO IT. Thank you for the inspiration. Merry Christmas.",

The chance of reoccurrence is supposed to be low which is supported by your octotype number. Are you on hormonals? I assume you are post menopausal. So either than the nodes I would feel pretty comfortable that I won't revisit this episode of my life. Most days I figure I will get through this and not look back. The stats support that idea, but there is this little man that sits on my other shoulder and whispers in my ear and I get a worrying again. I must say being in the middle of treatment is difficult to keep your head up at times. You have your good days and you have your bad days. Sitting on either side of the fence isn't easy.

As far as symptoms go the review posted is very similar to mine. No major se either than bowel movements some days loose other days not. As for the mastectomy I had it prior to chemo and was at a hockey game for my son the next day. As far as how your spirit processes the whole process I think for me it was a case of the part of my body had defied me so I wanted it gone. I am 44 yrs old with 2 darling kids ( most days) so I had chosen to do what I thought would be better for us as a family. Believe me I know all the supporting data but still made the mastectomy choice over the lumpectomy. So it is the week before Christmas and I have less hair than my husband :(. I am trying to remember this is a short trip to a long destination bit it is hard. People are plannning holiday festivities and I am still feeling held hostage by this thing we have been diagnosed. I have a friend that has gone through and she was a bit younger with young twins at the time, so I can do this. I just think it is a little harder perhaps at this time of the year.

I have always considered myself to be a physically strong individual and was proud if that. I cannot explain why getting cancer would make me weak but this is my issue. Perhaps talking to the oncology psychologist will help me figure that out. Market when were you dine chemo? Congrats on walking out in the neighborhood without your scarf. I admire that. I have two kids as well (boys) and the are conscious of my head covering. Probably they get that vibe from me. :( My youngest was hoping I would stay out and play basketball after I planted flowers. I normally would but damn it is hot with that rat on my head. I am looking to rock the shorter hair style. It is summer so I will do it up with some coloring and funky earrings.

How great that is to ditch the rat/wig. In Canada they dont team up their surgeries, it is a two step process. As I had rads I guess I can do the te or the other option I guess is to take fat from another part of my body to make a boob form. To be honest I didn't think I would want to head into reconstruction but am thinking I will to improve my personal body image.

I end up cutting them real short and slapping some polish on them. As for eye hair. I have lashes coming in on the top and bottom. For brows I finally have some hair coming in but it is fair so hard to see. I am hoping it is like the top of the head and comes in fair and then changes colors. Hopefully. I think the brow hair I miss more than the head hair. Spoke to a social worker yesterday to chat and she figures my mental recovery probably won't progress until my physical recovery progresses. I agree as I am pretty hung up on getting some normalcy back with my physical appearance. It is funny as I am no super model, as to why I am caught up on this looks thing.

Now we can't do that because it does happen to us. I get my forum name because I was shocked that this had happened to me. I was pretty healthy watched what I ate most of the time. I was overweight and drank alcohol regularly, but I also am the youngest of five and my no in my immediate family had been touched by the \"c\". With this being said it is a choice we make if we worry about something that may never happen. I had a friend that had bc about 9 years ago and if came back and she passed away 2 yrs ago in Oct. She passed away in her early forties leaving behind 3 kids her youngest was 10:(. That will always be in the back of my mind. I will not be able to stick my head in the sand any longer. I also know ladies who had bc 10+ years ago and are still going strong. I dont read the obits any longer and my cancer peer has this saying when she hears bad news about someone else that had cancer. \"They didn't have the same cancer as mine\". That is very true. We are all different. I am er+, her- with a low grade of 1 but with lymph nodes involved. Your cancer is different than mine. The stats are good and new data is found everyday. I am scared too but have limited the amount of time on this website and will try to put it aside. Man it's tough. The mental stuff is harder than the physical. I wish there was an answer for us. The social worker I speak with says it is a process of steps that you can't skip. It takes time. I have a great family and want to be here with them until I am drooling in my old age. You are doing awesome living your life. Keep doing that because lost time we have had already. You ate a positive person and probably just having a bad day. Hugs",

For instance you can have a grade 3 tumor, that is 5 cms and have 9 lymph nodes and still be a stage 3a. On the other hand you can also have a grade 1, with 2.2 cms, 4 lymph nodes and be considered a 3a. Although my breast surgeon had stated a 2b. Six of one, half a dozen of another. There is two different staging methods. The one is with the lymph nodes stuck together or the cancer is seen coming out if a node. The variables are very different with each case and I assume this is why they use it primarily fir treatment and will refer to a website like cancermath to input your individual information. This is just my own personal thoughts.",

If given the choice I would prefer to get in done and over with. I would prefer the 4 every two weeks. I assume they are equally effective. I had asked my oncologist about just doing the taxotere because I had read somewhere it was more effective with the grade 1 tumor but she indicated your protocol was based on your stage. They are the professionals so I have to trust them. So it looks like you just have the one more to go. I am jealous.",

Interesting that a few of us had the same issue this week. So I am next on the three rounds of taxotere. Ladies tell me how the first round has gone for those that have taken it already. I have officially said good-bye to fec. Honestly I can't complain to much as me se's have been minimal, although mentally I do feel about day 5 it does put you in a stupor.

      "Content": "Mar 19, 2012 09:59AM - edited Mar 19, 2012 10:03AM by Whatashocker3 Okay so the bloody nose is gone, the aches and pains have vanished, the roof of the top of my mouth no longer feels scorched.....guess what time it is?? It is time to go back for my 6th and final treatment. I must say I have always thought I would gracefully skip into the infusion room for my final treatment, but I have a variety of emotions. I know what the weekend will be like for one, scared because....well you know, and excited to not have to do another treatment and my friend the picc line should come out if everybody is of agreement. I had a teary session yesterday as I think about what I have been through so far and what lies ahead. The first mammogram, the ultrasound, the scary radiologist who spoke his thoughts aloud that we need to have that image biopsied, when the surgeon just told me she didn't think it was anything to worry about. Than the MRI and the biopsy and finally the constant calls to the BS office to see if I could get test results over the phone to put me out of my misery. I was doing this while going to meetings and having all these crazy thoughts in my head but I have to \"look\" like a professional. Than the BS's secretary tells me I have to go in for the results. Oh, oh this isn't a good sign. When those words were spoken I was in shock and my husband was in tears. Holy crap! Next came the decision making. Not alot of info available at this point but you still have to tell them how you want to proceed. The recommendation. Was a lumpectomy but after a discussion with my family doctor I elected for a mastectomy. The BS tells when going over the path results that it was a good decision as I had dcis in the breast as well. This I had found out from my family dr not the BS. Decisions are better made when there is information forthcoming to make them. Well the rest is in the history books and come the 21st I should have completed this chemo journey. For those just starting I would say it is entirely possible to do it. It isn't slot of fun mind you but I exercised and drank fluids so I think that helped. I exercised most days about 30-45 minutes. I found friends I didn't know I had. This is an amazing feeling. I was disappointed by the support I did not get from a sister I was close to. Not sure we can mend that fence, and I realized that my DH and two boys are the most special people in my life. My DH is an amazing man and I am blessed to have him. My 14 year old son was the one to shave my head on Christmas day and he did it because my DH just couldn't and my son knew I just couldn't reach. The insight, his spirit and empathy has also been very important to me. My youngest son gave me diversion from what was going on through his many hockey activities and his quite company and great hugs and kisses. As you can see I am truly blessed and this disease I \"had\" has taught me lessons I may not have learned. With the grace of God behind me I pray everyday for everyone currently going through it and I pray for those that already have. I also pray for myself and my family that we won't have to deal with it again. I look at it all as a bump in the road in a long journey and I will do whatever it is I can do to stay healthy for the rest of the journey. After the 21st I start rads on the 16th of April to be completed on the 11th of May. So as you can see from my story I shot the kitchen sink at it. Damn thing better not come back!! God bless everyone. May peace, happiness and health follow you going forward.",

I am a little angry,depressed etc. I do think alot of it has to do with how on earth there has been so many 40ish year olds diagnosed with this disease when the percentage is supposed to be like 25%. Then the treatments attached to bc, chemo and rad. Where is the cure? How can billions of dollars be raised for research and yet we are still sitting with chemo and rad for treatment. It is crazy frustrating because it seems that no matter what your lifestyle was like you couldnt have prevented getting it. I personally feel trapped in this whole process and my life is on hold. Six wks of radiation! Six weeks of driving 1 hour up and 1 hour back home for 15 mins of treatment. It just seems that the process hasn't developed in proportion to the money devoted for the cure.

I started the process in Sept and was officially given the diagnosis 10/05, has a mastectomy 10/14 and didn't start chemo until12/06.

You are fortunate to have a caring sister as mine although we were close doesn't seem to be much support for me at this time. But perhaps it is bcause the news is so shocking.

I am glad to get that out of the way because 5 leads to 6, which for me is the final one in this step. Than on to the rads. I have noticed the hostess for this topic has not been on, Darlam. I do think of her often and hope she is doing well. I just wanted to touchbase and say hello and hope everyone is coping as well as they can. I have ventured from time to time out of this topic and it is often to much information and it makes me feel overwhelmed so I am going to try and just stick to our group. We are all here to support one another through so I am sending out positive vibes to all hoping that it is quite here because everyone is out living their lives. Wish me luck on #5.

I guess ones skin doesn't react normally until the 3 week so I don't have anything to report there. On terms of brows and lashes, they have both flown south and I am going on 8 wks without them:(.

Probably it will be easier to follow this rule after treatment but I think they have a point. I think we all have to assume it was a bump in the road but the rest of our life is ahead of us. I think this is our route to a good long life ahead. It has been awfully quite on our discussion forum?? Where did everyone go? We have to rally the troops so we can support one another.",

I have 3 sisters and she was the one I thought I could count on. The other two have been better than the one I thought I could count on. She only lives a hour away from me. It has truly hurt my feelings but I can't dwell on it as negative energy isn't healthy. I must say I have been truly disappointed. Not sure how we can get things back to normal after this. Don't think we can. So give your sister a hug and know they all aren't like that.",

I called the doctor for a lump on my nipple it wasn't diagnosed through a mammogram. First one was at 44 after I brought it to their attention. How bout you?",
