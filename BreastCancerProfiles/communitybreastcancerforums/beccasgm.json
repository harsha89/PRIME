My husband used to be a stylist so he cut it short, we first dyed it red and then black right before it fell out. I had never dyed my hair before so it was fun seeing the different colors. I wound up getting a reddish-brown wig (see avatar) that I have gotten more compliments on than I ever did my real hair. People are really surprised that it is a wig!    ",

That felt really good. On the other hand, I am losing my eyelashes and eyebrows again. I wasnt surprised as I have read that it happens and I know they will grow back quickly, it is just a bummer. Chemo, the gift that just keeps giving. Oh well, I am happy and healthly and look forward to a healthly 2012!",
