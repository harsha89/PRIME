      "Content": "Nov 24, 2012 02:12PM - edited Nov 24, 2012 02:30PM by manksy Steiner18--thanks for starting this thread. It's nice to see some of the November surgery folk getting strong enough to enter into the next phase of treatment. On Monday I'll be two weeks out from surgery--and I'll meet with my oncologists. (Yes, I have two--one is the main oncologist, the other is an oncology fellow at the hospital. Both are fabulous--anyone near Boston, I highly recommend them.) on Monday I'm sure they will give me my start date, which should be within the next 2 weeks. The plan is for me to do 4-5 months, first of AC and then of something else my addled brain can't remember--or at least that was the plan before my path report came in. Here's a question for you all: are you preemptively cutting your hair? My hair is fairly long, past my shoulders. In an attempt to avoid the dramatic Lifetime Channel movie moment of brushing my hair and seeing a foot of it fall out--or the scene where the woman grabs her long locks and cuts her hair to under and inch, I've been considering a two-step approach: having my sister cut it to a bob this weekend and then having my hairdresser give me a pixie cut later this week. This sounded like a brilliant idea until late last night when I started getting cold feet. I love my hair. It's been short before--and every color under the rainbow--but it's ALWAY been my decision. I'm trying to make this as much my decision as possible but I'm struggling. Would love to hear your thoughts and advice. My sister and niece are begging me to do it... today! Gulp.",

MTJulie, be as kind to yourself as possible. You are in the right place and among friends. Best of luck tomorrow. And just know, what you are feeling is totally normal. This is a huge shock for all of us and so much information to take in so quickly. I'm a college professor and about 10 days ago I had a total meltdown, realizing that for the last six weeks I hadn't thought about my research for an instant--the research that I have loved these past few years and the book I was planning on finishing by the end of the year. But then I realized that I have spent these past few weeks learning an entirely new language--one I never wanted or expected to learn. But I've been reading everything I can get my hands on and learning on the fly so that I can make thoughtful choices. We are all--each in our own way and each with our own skill set--trying to muddle through this. And we will. I'm following not long behind you--my first dose is 12/17. I'm scared out of my wits--and grateful every day for my family, my friends, my job, and all of you on here. ",

I think of it as chemo's hundred day war with cancer--battleground: my body. My tips: if at all possible get a port in your arm rather than your chest. Drink A LOT of water. Let yourself rest on your bad days. Don't overdo it on your good days. Don't think that you will get ALL the side effects listed, but you'll get some. Some are crappy (examples for me: joint pain on taxol, queasy on AC), others are just peculiar (peeling on my fingers, watery eyes), and others you hear about you'll never get (joint pain with neulasta during AC). Keep a running list of questions to ask your Onc. Bring a friend or loved one to chemo with you--and if you can bring two--it's a good time to catch up with a dear friend and let them feel useful--and it's amazing to find yourself laughing with a dear pal in the infusion room. Bring the chemo nurses baked goods--they'll love you and always look out for you every time you come--plus they deserve them! Find a therapist or social worker through the hospital--ideally someone who has worked with cancer patients before. It's incredibly helpful to talk with someone who understands and is not afraid of what you are feeling and can help you prepare for the road ahead. Take a walk every day that you can--it doesn't have to be fast or far--but it will help you feel much better. Don't buy a zillion hats, wigs, and scarfs until you realize which look feels right for you. Everyone I talked to found one look that felt right for them--and usually it takes about 3-4 of life as a bald person to figure out what feels right. Then once you know what you like, you can buy what you know you will actually use. Purell is your best friend--keep small bottles in you purse, bag, backpack, car, etc. Try to find someone else to take care of you besides your doctor: an acupuncturist, a yoga instructor who knows how to find chest opening restorative poses that are safe for BC patients, a massage therapist who works with cancer patients and might even do scar work, etc. Finally, listen to your body. This process is so alienating to your body, so take special care to listen to the signals your body is giving you about what it wants or needs. Warmest wishes and best of luck slogging through chemo. You can do it!",

      "Content": "Dec 10, 2012 06:54PM - edited Dec 10, 2012 07:02PM by manksy Hi all. Beachlovinmom and mfml, next Monday 12/17 I'll be starting on the 4 doses of AC and 4 doses of Taxol (spaced out every 14 days). I'm BRACA1+ and got this diagnosis just the months after I turned 40 and I'm in great health otherwise, so I don't know if that played into the decision, as well, for my chemo plan. I went to the dentist today just to get a cleaning and make sure everything looks good before I start chemo on Monday. The hygienist was lovely--and promised me that she would call to schedule a mammogram since it's been a few years for her. (I feel like I've become the postergirl for mammograms these days. I am alive--and will be for a damn long time!--because I had one at 40.) They highly recommended brushing at least twice a day and continuing to floss. Use a soft/sensitive bristle toothbrush. Use ACT non-alcohol dry mouth formula or Biotine dry mouth as often as I want. They also said make sure that I'm using something with fluoride every day. They highly recommended being pro-active about mouth sores. Also, no matter how much it sounds good to suck on candies (sugar or sugar free) they said DON'T--we are much more susceptible to cavities. So stick to water and mouthwash. And they also said I should call them with questions, as well, along the way--and they can write prescriptions or see me if I am struggling. So remember! The Onc is there--but so is your dentist, if you have questions.  I love the idea of planning our summer vacations. And I know I need to find at least a few scarves or do wig shopping this week. Word is silk scarves are the most comfortable? Not cheap, but I figure it's Hanukkah, I can buy myself a present or two. Anyone find some pretty ones out there?",
