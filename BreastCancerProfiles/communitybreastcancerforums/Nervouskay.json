She took her time and examined me and said everything looks normal. I\u2019m just not sure how to feel because I still feel uneasy.

I think I\u2019m feeling better now and I have faith that things will work out. I have found other similar stories of weight loss and their breasts also indented at the top.. it just scares me bc my dad died of laryngeal cancer and it was really rough on me. I'm so sorry that you guys are going to through this. Cancer is a monster and I really wish that it didn\u2019t exist. You are sure stronger than I am <3",

I examined further and noticed that it is indented and I can feel the tissue isn't as \"thick\" there and it is like there is tissue missing underneath. I made a dr appt as soon as I woke up and the dr did a breast exam. She said she doesn't think it's anything but that I have dense breasts. She made a referral for a mammogram. I called and since I'm 28 they only do ultrasounds so I have that tomorrow. I'm a nervous wreck and google isn't helping. I have children and I'm so afraid of leaving them due to cancer ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ all sites says indentation is a sign of breast cancer. Has anyone dealt with this and not had it be cancer ðŸ˜­ I\u2019m so afraid of dying and leaving my children. All I have done is cry all day Log in to post a reply",
