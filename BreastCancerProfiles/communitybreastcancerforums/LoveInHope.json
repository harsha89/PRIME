    "Content": "LoveInHope wrote: Diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004; it became metastatic in 2006 and attacked the brain. At that time the brain was radiated but since then the cancer has spread to the spine, lung, liver, spleen. It has also re-occurred with new markers in the brain. Obviously the prognosis for this is very dire. I am left with a choice of starting a regime of Ixempra or do nothing. Is there any light that can be shed on this? Log in to post a reply",
