After I started Arimidex, I experienced severe shin pain and of course, my first thought was of mets to my bones, and then I went to an Arimidex website and saw posts about how much shins can hurt on Arimidex.  So, it's all normal, the fear, the confused feelings, the need to remember our own strength and courage at all times.  My mother had BC in the early 60s and went through agony with the brutal treatments of the day.  No support groups, one could not even talk about cancer. I'm so grateful to be living now in these modern medical times.  To all of you, I send my support and wish you much courage and patience.",
