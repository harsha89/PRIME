Best advice i can give you is GET UP AND WALK ASAP after surgery.  it will HURT like heck, but you will heal much faster.  I was back in my room day of surgery by 6pm and by 7am next morning i was walking the halls. every two hours i would go walk.  so while i stayed till saturday, i was pretty mobile by time i got home. also w/regards to the healing aspect, i was to have drains for 2 weeks, i got them out 2 days after i got home!  dr. said never had someone heal so fast. Good luck, and let us know what happens!",

My mom worked for a breast cancer specialist for many years and said that when a surgeon is almost certain it is cancer, he will get the lab to return the results right away.  I had a lumpectomy rather than a biopsy and the surgeon told my mom he would call the next day by 4pm.  Her heart sank because she knew then that he was pretty certain that it was cancer.  It was. But as the others have said, everywhere is different and the wait is horrible whether it is hours or days.  I pray you get an \"all clear\" report!  I wouldn't wish breast cancer on my worst enemy!",

Two days later I was in the surgeons office and 3 days later was told I had cancer.  The reason I am telling you this, is I found that when the radiologist is fairly certain it is cancer, they move VERY FAST.  They send you straight to the surgeon, not to a follow-up mammo.  Since you are having to wait, I would say that is a GOOD sign! Radiologists look at so many of these things, they are pretty darn good and recognizing cancerous ones.  That is not to say you have nothing to worry about, I just want you to take a deep breath and hold on to the 80% are benign. If it is DCIS then all you would have to do is have it cut out and possibly mammo's every 6 months.  All doctors are different and all treatments are different, I can only share with you my story and try to offer you a little peace. Good luck to you and keep us posted!",

Carolynn  I wouldnt let them rush you into any surgery until you have had a chance to get 2nd opinion (if you want- I didnt need one but others do) and have time to decide what you want to do regarding reconstruction.  It is better the less number of times you are put to sleep.  And like you said, it's been there 5 months, what is another week to 10 days giving you some time.  Good luck!!",

Manydy1313, welcome to the thread.  Chemo sucks, but at least we have it!!!  How many treatments do you have to do? Renrel, welcome to you also, although I wish none of us had ever met!  But, at least we have each other to lean on and no one has to go through this alone!  I am thinking your onco score is prob higher with a 25 - 30 % recur rate w/o tx.  Mine was 36 with a 25% recur with surgery only.  I know trying to make all these decisions is so hard, but my onco gave me the best advice I have ever gotten.  He told me \"no matter what you decide to do, it is the RIGHT decision!\"  Him saying this to me seemed to take the pressure off.  I did 4 DD A/C chemo and am half-way finished with Herceptin.  Side effects from chemo are the pits, but they will give you really good drugs to ease them.  And you will get through it.  For me, the mental \"after effects\" have been WAY worse than any of the \"physical effects\" during treatment. Hey Jacq, thanks for filling is more info for us, I got you added!!!  Nice to meet you, sorry your here too!  Funny, even as I am typing this post, I STILL can't believe I am here!!!! Seabee, gonna re-try the link in just a minute.  Thanks!!! Snowbird, welcome to you also, and also sorry you are here too!  Your onco score does stink as far as being in the \"gray\" rather than more definate.  I will be praying for you on Monday!  If you can, take people with you.  That first treatment is a little, no, a LOT terrifying, but having people to talk to will help keep your mind off it. Harveysjule, I havent started the new thread yet, but I am going to as soon as I finish this post.  I am going to copy & past the stats we have collected so far and call it the \"Onco type roll call\".  Guess I will put under \"chemo before, during, after\" category. if you can't find it, just click on my ID here and you will see my posts, and there you will find it.  If you have probs you can PM me too.  Too all of you getting ready to start chemo, if you haven't I would recommend getting a port!  I didnt get mine until my 4th A/C tx (only because I still had 18 Herceps coming up), because chemo will EAT YOUR VEINS up!!!  I have hard brown veins all in my right arm and everytime I have to be put to sleep (all the reconstructions) they cant use your port, they need GOOD veins in your arm.  Now it is hard to get an IV started in my arm! ",

Now I have since become more \"educated\" in all of this and guess what???? I found the \"Adjuvant Online\" website and you know what?  That piece of paper he gave me with \"Oncotype DX\" written on it is an EXACT replica of the Adjuvant Online results based on my type of cancer.  So until I go back in January, I was doing my own \"interpretation\" of what my onco score would be with a 25% recurrence. So, based on their website, when I plug in the 25%, it says my score would be 36- Now I have since learned that they actually do a 20+ gene test on your tumor to give a score, so when I tell him I want it done, it could very well change to better ......or worse......but probably better.  And your welcome, I have enjoyed doing the \"data gathering\" as I find this kind of stuff so interesting! ",
