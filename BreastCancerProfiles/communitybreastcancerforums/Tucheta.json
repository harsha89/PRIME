The doctors provided me only with basic information after my mastectomy so most of what I know about LE is from internet and especially from your most valuable postings on this subject (thank you all so much for your generosity in sharing!).. As for  LE Therapists... I only found some who are doing Lymph Drainage Massage, however I am not sure if they are reliable since I am not aware of the existance of any official certification here My main concern is that I will have to fly due to my work and I would certainly not want to do it without a sleeve, even thoug I do not have LE yet. I could order one from another country, over internet, but I understand it has to be \"customised\". Is there any way I can determine myself what kind of sleeve I need? I would probably be able to measure my arm but as far as I understand the degree of compression is also important and that's why you get a prescription from doctor. Any ideas what to do in this case? Would a less-than-perfectly-fitted-sleeve be better than no-sleeve-at-all? Thanks so much Ralu ",

With rads I felt so tired, I wished I could lie on the floor in the middle of the day and sleep. Maybe it was in part because I had the treatment very early in the morning and was going directly to work afterwards. The fatigue got better about 2-3 weeks after finishing rads. Now I am on Herceptin since January and still get suddenly tired in the afternoon. Probably some remaining SE of chemo and rads.  ",

I thought I'd share with you a little bit about our ancient tradition for 1st of March, called \"Martisor\" (which could be approximately translated as a diminutive of March or \"little March\"). On this day men are offering women little Martisor amulets or talismans - usually a little piece of decoration representing a flower, heart, horseshoe etc, on a white and red string. Women wear them pinned on their blouses until 9 March, and the Martisor is supposed to bring health and good luck and strength and a beautiful springtime. You can find out more if you google Martisor. So here is a virtual Martisor for each of you, dear ladies, and may it bring you health and good luck!

So, more as a preventative procedure. I have no idea what are the criteria for establishing this risk or how reliable an mri is. On the other hand, I think that the path report you get from a lumpectomy is more reliable than the one from biopsy, probably because you can analyse a larger area.

I ordered off-the-shelf, on internet, did my own measuring and chose Jobst because I simply wasn't able to find out where I fit in the Juzo sizing chart. I guess I am not that smart . It took them almost a month to get here but now I am the happy owner of two sets of arm sleeves and gauntlets: one set is 15/20 mmHg, the other one is 20/30 mmHg. Based on the advice I've got from Binney in another thread, I thought for prevention (my case) the lower compression one should be fine. The second one is for backup or... for later. I had no problems putting them on, following the instructions on the package, which are exactly as shrink and Binney explained, but I was sooooo afraid that \"something\" might happen that I took them off after 15 minutes. I felt so stupid and helpless. I did not notice any change in color, but there were very fine marks on the skin, like an imprint from the texture. Does this mean they are too tight? Now that I've read Binney's recommendations I feel encouraged to try wearing them for an hour over the weekend and will try to be less paranoid. Some other questions: 1. The wide bands of the gauntlet and arm sleeve are overlapping. Is this good or bad? 2. For prevention, would it be wise to wear these garments regularly, e.g. during the night, not just for flying? 3. If the risk for arm LE is so high when flying, isn't there a high risk for truncal LE too? Thank you all so much for all the help and information you provide Ralu",
