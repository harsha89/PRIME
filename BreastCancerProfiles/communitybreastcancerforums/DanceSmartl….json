I was wondering if it is possible to get partial breast radiation in Alberta; as best I could tell from the Alberta Health protocols online, whole breast radiation is still the provincial standard. I am worried about rads as I have sensitive skin that burns, scars, discolours very easily. The closest rads centre to me is also 5 hours drive one way, so 5 sessions would be a dream come true for me! Dance",

I asked about partial breast and other clinicial radiation trials and was told that although my clinical tumour characteristics qualified me for these trials, my age did not. So, looks like the normal whole breast radiation route for me. Had my CT scan / simulation yesterday. Hope chemo goes well for u! Will be interested to hear how the radiation trial goes when u get to that point. Dance",

I told them about 2 weeks after I was diagnosed, when I still had two weeks to go before my surgery (6 days to go now!). My thinking was that it might be easier for them to get used to the idea that I would be going into the hospital for surgery rather than suddenly disappearing on them. I tried to be very matter-of-fact and not make a big deal out of it but not hide anything either. I have had two other surgeries in the last three years, one of which was emergency, so my kids know that Mom will come home from the hospital. They are also somewhat familiar with the \"C\" word as my father has been battling Stage IV prostrate cancer since 2009 and my mother-in-law just finished treatment for Stage II endometrial cancer this past summer. (Sidenote: cancer sucks and can stop messing with our family anytime now.) I was a bit surprised at their reactions. I thought DD would be most upset, but she only asked one question (related to breast cancer searches on our internet browser - these tech-savvy kids terrify me!) and has been pretty quiet since. She tells me she Ioves me a lot and hugs me a lot. DS, on the other hand, has had a million questions, the first of which was, \"Are you going to die?\". (My answer: \"No, not for a long time because we are going to do all the things we need to do to kill this cancer!\") He wanted to feel the cancer, tried to figure out how different it is from the cancers his grandparents have, and had a long debate with himself about whether he should tell his friends at school or not. I just let him talk and tried to answer his questions as honestly and factually as I could. I visited each of their teachers as well as the school front office. I told them that I would be away from home for medical treatment for considerable lengths of time in 2018 as I will have to travel 2 hours one way for surgery and chemo (if needed) and 5 hours one way for rads. I asked them to please keep an eye on our kids and let us know if they are struggling or overly emotional during the remainder of the school year. I also phoned the mother of my daughter's BFF and let her know about my upcoming treatment, so that she can help her daughter support DD when I am gone. I totally understand your concerns about middle-school mean girls, as DD is the same age as your daughter. Fortunately, DD has an awesome BFF now, but she spent the first five years of elementary school with no good friends at all. It's tough to see them struggle. Dance  ",

I should have been more specific in what I wrote because I was thinking specifically of Tamoxifen, which is intended to be a selective estrogen receptor blocker for the breasts, as opposed to AI's which target estrogen production from sources other than the ovaries. I think it is important to note that Tamoxifen is not active systematically in the same fashion everywhere in the body; my understanding is that while it blocks estrogen receptors in breast cells, it does not do so in uterine or bone cells and can actually stimulate these cells.

Radiation is intended to reduce the risk of a local recurrence (cancer coming back in the same area of the breast as the original tumor). Hormone therapy prevents estrogen from stimulating cancer cell growth in the breasts, while chemotherapy is aimed at cancer cells that may have migrated to other areas of the body. Hope that helps?

      "Content": "Dec 30, 2017 01:21PM DanceSmartly wrote: Hi PomegranatePeaches (love the name!), Thanks for starting this topic; I am very interested in this subject because I, too, have PCOS and am wondering whether I should just have a complete hysterectomy and start AI's rather than taking Tamoxifen. 1. The research I have done indicates that women with PCOS are at higher risk of endometrial cancer (cancer of the uterine lining) due to irregular (or no) periods and thus long periods of time between shedding of the uterine lining. So far, the research I've read indicates that there are no well-established links between PCOS and ovarian cancer or breast cancer - but I have a difficult time believing that our messed up reproductive hormones don't play a role in the development of cancer in any of our reproductive organs, especially when our cancers are hormone receptor positive. Anyway, if you are subject to irregular periods thanks to PCOS and are therefore likely to be a higher risk of endometrial cancer, you may want to consider having a complete hysterectomy. My understanding is that Tamoxifen, which is normally prescribed to premenopausal women with ER+ cancer, increases your risk of endometrial cancer even further. If you have a hysterectomy, you will be put on AI's instead, which don't seem to have the same risk for endometrial cancer. Others have already addressed the downside of a complete hysterectomy, especially at your age - potential for early onset of bone problems, heart problems, cognitive function problems and sexual function problems, all due to loss of estrogen. The really sucky thing for young women with ER+ cancer is that in order to avoid a recurrence of our cancer, we may experience these problems anyway due to estrogen suppression through hormone therapy. 4. This is an interesting question. As you likely know, PCOS is caused by excess androgen production. It seems there are two ways this can happen: either your body makes a normal amount of estrogen and too much testosterone, or your body makes a normal amount of testosterone and not enough estrogen - either way you end up with excess androgen production. My understanding is that excess testosterone is responsible for the male pattern baldness, excess facial hair growth, and cystic acne that many women with PCOS experience, while lack of estrogen is responsible for irregular or no menstrual cycles. Since the ovaries are responsible for the majority of both estrogen and testosterone production in women, it would seem that removal of the ovaries should resolve these problems. However, the reading I have done suggests that it just isn't that simple. My understanding is that despite its name, PCOS is an endocrine system problem, not a reproductive system problem. The reproduction system issues we experience are symptoms of PCOS, not the cause. PCOS is often linked with insulin resistance, which I understand won't be resolved by a hysterectomy and may even get worse as a result of one. PCOS may also be the result of a malfunctioning adrenal gland, which won't be resolved by a hysterectomy. For the last 10 years, I have successfully controlled most of my PCOS symptoms with an oral contraceptive. Now that I have ER/PR+ breast cancer, that won't be an option for me. I am afraid that suppressing the estrogen in my body to avoid breast cancer recurrence or metastasis will make my PCOS symptoms even worse - and without treatment, they are miserable. When I meet my medical oncologist, I intend to ask that she refer me to an endocrine oncologist. My hope is that an endocrine oncologist will be able to help me determine whether my adrenal glands are playing a role in my PCOS and whether I have insulin resistance that might successfully be treated with metformin (which I have read may actually be beneficial with respect to breast cancer!). At the very least, I will get my hormone levels tested and hopefully gain a better idea of the actual cause of my PCOS; this then may help me determine the best path for simultaneously treating my PCOS and hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. Hope this helps! I was feeling sorry for myself having to deal with both PCOS and breast cancer at age 42, but you are younger still by a full decade. My heart goes out to you and I wish you the best. Dance",

Please remember that even with a Birads 5 score, there is still a chance the biopsy could come back benign; there was a lady to whom that happened just the other day on this board. I also wanted to share that a Birads 5 score has no implications with respect to your prognosis should it turn out not to be benign; that can only be determine by pathology. I had a Birads 5 score, and although it turned out I did indeed have cancer, mine has a very good prognosis. Sending u a gentle virtual hug and wishing u the best. Dance",
