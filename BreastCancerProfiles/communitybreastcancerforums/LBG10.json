My question, is my oncologist doing everything that should be done? He does lab work and a manual exam when I see him. I asked at my last visit what labs were done, he said to check my liver function since Iam on tamoxifen, so just a basic CBC and CMP panel. Are there lab tests to check tumor markers? Should I be getting these? Also, I have Never had a CT scan, is this usually a standard of care? What tests do you do routinely with your oncology follow ups?? Log in to post a reply",
