I have no family history of BC.   I went to my Dr. today and she said she thought it was a cyst upon my request, she referred me to have an ultrasound. (I am nursing still, so they did not want to do a mammogram.)  Apparently, they are very fibrocystic. Anyway after the ultrasound, the Dr. came in (it was done at a breast cancer care center, so they specialize in BC) for like 1 minute and said, \"It is a cluster of cysts. It's nothing to worry about.\" The whole anxiety of the day and the time waiting for appt date to come around sort of left me stupid for a minute. So, I didn't ask any questions. If it were you, would you accept that and move on? Or would you ask for them to be aspirated? Any wisdom you have to offer would be highly appreciated. My husband is anxious to be done with this, as it really scared him and he doesn't understand why I would not just take the Dr's 1 minute diagnosis. Thanks.   Log in to post a reply",

I figured at least I could look at the terminology they used and go from there. That would give me a better idea of whether I should pursue further testing or just let it go for now. I don't want to be paranoid, but I think this experience has caused me to realize that just because I have so many kids, no family history and have done a lot of breastfeeding, doesn't make me exempt from this disease and that I need to be aware of my own body and health.   Thanks again for your support and responses.  PS: My baby is 14 months...but still nursing. He doesn't seem to want to slow down at all, including nightly feedings. Even though he is my 7th, he has made me feel like a 1st time mom all over again, breaking all of my norms for my other kids. :)  ",
