Lost my hair by day 14 of 1st treatment. Cried for 4 days solid and it is not like I am very vain, just really got me. Now I am ok about it. The little of my hair left, nearly all gone but I have a very sore head all this week. I suppose when the spikes gone completely it will not be as sore.This week WBC was down at day 10 and the  docs advised to stay at home and no visitors, cracking up.! Each treatment on day 21. I will have 4 AC and 4 T and herceptin. Started treatment Jan 6th.",

Just do not want to do it.  I have not had a great time since tx 2. Now I have been put on antibiotics for my throat and just feel really bad. Seem to be crying all the time or if not crying trying to stop myself. I am just so tired. I feel so useless. My house is like a war zone, it is so messy. I do not know how you guys are doing it, I only have one child and she is 11. You all seem to be coping much better. But it does help reading your posts so thanks for that.",
