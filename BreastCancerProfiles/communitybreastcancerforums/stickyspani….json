I know there is nothing I can do until I have had the scan but 7 days seems an eternity - then my appointment with the consultant isn't for another month. I wasn't too worried to start with but I am thinking about it all the time now. I am pleased your scan came back clear Wilson - and I do hope the itchiness stops soon - it can drive you mad - especially when you are in public and would love to scratch or rub at it!!! ",

I think this has worried me so much because I can't find any signs of that the doctor thought he saw - just felt the need to talk to someone other than my immediate family - don't want to worry them too much. ",
