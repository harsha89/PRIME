I have already had a bilateral mastectomy with TE on Oct 9th, on Oct 16th another surgery to remove the TE and necrosis from both sides, so not off to a good start already. My path report showed I had clear margins, tumor size 3.0 cm, grade 2, and 0/3 nodes, although it said something about isolated tumor cells in the first node, that I will be asking about tomorrow. It was invasive ductual carcinoma, and I am ER-,PR- and HER2-, so I know chemo is a given just not sure of what kinds. Glad I will have others to share this journey, hopefully we will be able to help each other.  Take care,,,,,",

Woke up this morning with a rash all around the port site, under my arm, up my neck and on my face. Took a benadryl and that helped. Almost looks like a reaction to whatever they swabbed my skin with before putting in the port, and under the bandage it looks raw where the adhesive was. Darn,,,,just one more thing to add to the list, hoping it doesn't delay the start of my chemo. txjunebug,,,hope the meds work just as well for me :)",

Had my port put in this morning and it is very uncomfortable right now and hurts to turn my head to the left. I will be having AC x 4 followed by Taxol x 4, and neulasta shots the day after treatment. From reading all the previous posts looks like I won't be enjoying our traditional turkey dinner on Thursaday as it will be day 3 and most of you say the SE are kicking in by then. Hoping to learn from you all and give my support to you also !",

Guess I  better start taking the Xanax again :) Enjoy your weekend ladies,,do something nice just for yourself !!",
