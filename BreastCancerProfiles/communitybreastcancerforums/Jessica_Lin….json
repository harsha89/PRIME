I've gotten a tattoo since the biopsy but it was on the upper outer thigh of my opposite side. No issues with it but it was on a completely different quadrant of the body. I didn't even know working out was a thing to be cautious of! I love Body Pump and have been doing it for years, my weights usually stay around 20lbs but for nearly 700 reps. I think I'm going to see if I can track down my old medical records to see if it shows how many nodes were removed. That is at least a start! Thanks again you guys!",

After talking it over with my husband I'm just going to switch arms, not ideal but whatevs!! My right arm will just have to stay pure! I honestly feel like it would probably be fine but would rather not take a chance. I had no idea flying was a thing!!! I fly ALL THE TIME! I've never had an issue so fingers crossed it never becomes one. I'm really glad I stumbled across this discussion board and wish I had known about it sooner.",
