So far no one is brca pos, but I am sure there must be some yet to be disovered gene lurking in the shadows.  I will probably make my decision this week. Anyone else have issues with their spouse being afraid of mastectomy?/  ",

Seeing surgeon again to decide between mastectomy or another lumpectomy. My oncotype score just came back at 28 so they want to do chemo and start it before the next surgery.",
