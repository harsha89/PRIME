Because of breathing issues with Taxotere, I have had several lung CT scans over the last few years, always showed clean, no nodules, etc. I just saw a CT scan that was done in late 2016, because my MO ordered a follow up. It showed at least 5 nodules, all 5 mm or less, and in various parts of my lower lungs. I was told at the time, could be pneumonia scarring, etc, so I think I put it out of my head, but now that I'm looking more closely, and thinking I last had pneumonia/pleurisy 30 years ago. Surely leftovers from that would have been on all my prior scans? Then I thought maybe it was caused by a forever cough I had that might have been Valley Fever, but looked up those dates and it started a few months after that 2016 CT scan. I have to wait another week for a CT scan, and then longer for results b/c my MO is on a much needed vacation. Any thoughts or experience you can share? And quick aside - my MO has never done maker tests for me. When I asked, he said too many false positives. Have you found the tests to be helpful? I'm sure he would order if I pushed, just wondering if I should be insisting. Thanks, and blessings/peace to you all today!",
