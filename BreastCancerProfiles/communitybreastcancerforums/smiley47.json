I wish you did not have to wait for the results that just adds to the stress. I had similar pain this last month on falsodex after being injected with my third infusion. I had sciatic nerve pain and could barely walk for three weeks, started loosing weight and sweated awfully.  I had a scan and it showed progression and the doctor gave me morphine for the pain; I looked at deaths door.  The day after seeing the doctor I awoke to no pain or symptoms that had been plaquing me for three weeks; I think I had a reaction to the faslodex, my doctor was a little taken aback when I told her the next day I needed no pain meds and all symptoms had disappeared.  I am now back on taxol chemo and feeling so much better.",

Then in the summer I started to get lots of pain in the ribs and was diagnosed with bone mets to the ribs, I was put on femara and started to have terrible flu symptoms and pains in my body that were unbearable; the doctors and nurses did not know why I had so much pain and flu like symptoms.  My onc thought it was my bodies way of interpreting the cancer. I would live with hot water bottles and advil at double doses every four to six hours. The pains in my bones would hurt for three weeks and then move to another area but the flu symptoms were continuous; so bad I would cry in desperation and weariness. A few months later the mets to the bones and liver were getting worse and so I was switched to another chemo drug and the flu symptoms started to go away over a two week period but the bones still hurt and eventually the scans showed more progression of the bones. I found the cancer web sites for stage 4 were very happy with the femara medicine in comparison the stage 3 threads of pain in the bones and the flu symptoms; which gave me hope it was the femara drug and nothing worse. When I met with my radiologist a couple of weeks ago he said that it is a well known fact that if you have extensive bone mets and take femara then you can have extreme pain from the drug in the bones. I wish I had spoken to him when I had these symptoms but thought my onc or family doctor would be open and knowledable enough to pass this on. They would only offer me more pain meds such as morphine that had no effect on the pain and symptoms but advil worked wonders in comparison. Another symptom I had on Femara was the feeling of dizzyiness and feeling like I could have something like a panic attack; it was all very disturbing and life altering. I hope you find help and move on from these symptoms. I noticed you are in Ontario the same as I and if you would like to email me privately you are welcome too. smiley47",

You stated your situation so well, I remember saying the same thing to my radiologist. I just wanted a treatment to work so I could catch my breathe and find my feet but instead I went through the anti hormonals quickly and had lots of progression. On femera I was bed bound for three months, did chemo(taxol) got better everything shrunk so I had a chemo break on faslodex and was bed bound again with lots of progression and now I am on chemo for life. The oncologists just give the information as it is and its hard to hear and absorb, i'm still trying to find an anxiety medicine, no luck so far so I just live in a state of high anxiety, fear and worry and some times I get worn out thinking about my sitation and feel numb. What will be will be and I go about my chores. Scans are paticularly hard so if you can take a friend that helps, avoid reading the doom and gloom posts and look for positive experiences to gain strength from. Someone just posted about twice being on deaths door and rebounded each time to the shock of her doctors. Some say its not how much cancer you have but a matter of findingthe right treatment plan.

Your doctor sounds nice and comforting. I think when we have stage four we would be daft to think it only in one place, sometimes it takes time to show up else where and the key to all of this terrible cancer curse is that they can control and deal with the ovaries and uterus and hopefully it has not gone anywhere else and your treatments will help you.

My chemo nurse told me that she sees regularly people start chemo with normal markers too have them shoot up and then eventually go down but not always within range for \"normal\" because of the drugs in the system not because of the cancer. My onc has stated this too and the last time I was on chemo they stayed outside normal range for the liver by 20 points to go within normal range once chemo stopped, which is what the onc thought would happen. Hope this helps , babbling a little, I hate email to explain myself.",

I had the best blood marker sample going down to 164 from 235 and then this week I went back to have my chemo and found I had gone up 24points to 188. I am on second week of chemo so blood work would represent last weeks chemo and not the week off chemo. Could it be the chemo affecting my liver ( I believe it is hard on the liver) and not the Taxol starting to be ineffective? Thanks for any advice",

She shrugged her shoulders and said my hair would grow back on Navelbine but taxol it would not, I thought taxol would be a better drug and she agreed it was higher up on the chain of chemo drugs for effectiveness but hard on a woman psychologically",

The doctors I have dealt with have been very abrupt and factual. Sometimes they are discussing my situation in a hip/happy manner that I feel is bizarre and asking for my opinion on treatment options that I do not feel in a place to comment on but they do want my input. I am still trying to cope with the cancer stage I am at and the standard of communication I have to navigate when I do not feel secure or aware of all the facts. I have found this site to be very helpful and positive in helping me navigate the negative treatment I get from the medical community or the lack of information I receive in a positive aspects of the treatments we undergo; I feel they always want to tell me the worse case. I was also told after two drugs did not work for me that I would be on chemo for the rest of my life and that was taxol for three weeks on and one week off but after four treatments I am going on a trail drug. So now I am worried that will not work and I will have to ride another wave of uncertainty. It is a roller coaster for you emotionally but just remember when you are unsure ask for help from the girls and someone will be out there going through or has been through what you are experiencing and they will reach out to you and help you.   Smiley47",
