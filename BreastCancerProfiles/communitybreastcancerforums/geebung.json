In some ways it minimises stress to have your surgery quickly so you don't have too many sleepless nights and read too much information which scares you crazy and may not be appropriate to your situation. On the other hand, time before surgery can help you to process what is happening, ask your medical people questions and prepare for what lies ahead with the support of family and friends.   The great thing about this site is that there is always someone here to read and give feedback. I wish I had known about it when I was sleepless and scared at 3am each morning! oxox Jane ",

It's not right that anyone should be made to feel they are overreacting. We know our own bodies and we know when something is not normal. It's much better to overreact than stick your head in the sand. If there is something wrong, then you have done the right thing by catching it as early as possible and if it's nothing, you have peace of mind. I had a spontaneous, blood stained discharge from my right breast for nearly 2 years. I saw several doctors and ended up being referred to a breast centre. Samples of the discharge were sent to pathology. The result - excess estrogen and multiple cysts. All benign. All this time, my left breast was quietly cooking up DCIS and by the time it was found, it was extensive and high grade and I had a mastectomy. So the discharging breast was benign and the other was not. How ironic! ",

However, losing a breast is sad and a very traumatic experience for many women. Every experience is different and your feelings during your journey will be sometimes unique to you but mostly, shared by your bc sisters.   To begin with, I was in denial, then numb, then panic-stricken, then overjoyed that it was curable. Since then, I have experienced all those emotions alternatively on any given day but now the feelings are more muted.   Think about reconstruction.

DCIS is virtually 100% curable and microinvasion, although technically taking you from stage 0 to stage 1, is still extremely early and curable. I had a lumpectomy last year for DCIS and the path report also came back saying that there were \"several areas suggesting microinvasion\". I then had a mastectomy and no microinvasion was found. There will be some of women along soon who did have a small invasion so they will be able to relate their experiences. Listen to Annie - you most certainly will get through this.

The younger my children were the more I worried about call backs and anything worrying about my breasts. You are definitely right in getting this checked out. I'm a great believer in any abnormal symptoms being examined by professionals. You are no doubt aware that IBC is rare but, if you log on here, all types of breast cancer will seem to be more common because those of us who have been diagnosed tend to stick around whereas the hundreds (with a few exceptions) who get benign results tend to not come back here. The fewer symptoms you have, the more likely this is not breast cancer. You may have been bitten by some sort of insect and had an allergic reaction, it might be some type of benign skin complaint. However, it's very sensible to have this checked. I hope you can keep very busy over the weekend and up until you see the specialist. I won't tell you not to worry because that's easier said than done but distractions in the form of work and play will help. Above all, please don't read further on these boards about those aleady diagnosed otherwise your imagination will be fuelled to full panic mode. Why torture youself when, in all likelyhood, you are dealing with something totally benign. It's very likely that you will be given the all-clear and will soon be able to put this behind you. Wishing you a distracting weekend, Jane",

I have decided to insist on a yearly digital from now on. Perhaps this was just the skill of the technician - I should imagine she would have been gentle with a regular mammo as well. With regards to your itchy spot, it is sure to be something benign and easily treatable but it's sensible to have it checked out. Last year I had a very annoying itch. It started in my armpit and spread over the right side of my breast, almost to the nipple. My dermatologist said it was a touch of eczema and prescribed some cream. My breast surgeon said it wasn't anything to worry about. Nothing much worked but it eventually went away without treatment. I've never had anything like it before and it did make me think the worst. I have read that inflamatory breast cancer does not disappear and then come back. Once the symptoms are there, they tend to worsen. I am no expert on this and there will be others along soon who know a lot more about this than I do.  Keeping my fingers crossed that you and Sandy will have good news. Jane ",

I had a bloodstained discharge from my right breast for about a year. I saw a breast specialist who told me that the discharge was coming from a cyst. She was not keen on my having a ductogram or any surgery and I was happy to take the non-interventionist approach. About 2 years later, when I was diagnosed with DCIS in the other breast, I had a fine needle biopsy of the cyst and the fluid was benign. There will be others who had a different experience who will hopefully tell you of their experiences. This may not be relevant to your situation but over 33 years ago when I was pregnant with my first child, I had bloodstained discharge from both breasts from about halfway through the pregnancy until my milk came in after my baby was born. I think I'm just prone to that sort of thing.",

It's very understandable that you are hearing that little voice (tell it to stuff a sock in its mouth!) at this time. You had a scare last time and, having to wait SO long for the results, you had a lot of time to think the worst. Just about everyone here will agree that waiting and uncertainty are the worst. I hope you get results more quickly next time so that your mind can be put at ease. You are being proactive and wise to be having regular screening. It's still a while until November so I hope you will not worry too much before then. I have had multiple cysts for years and they have not given me any trouble apart from one that produced a blood-stained discarge for about a year. Lots of women have cysts and live with them until ripe old age!  Good luck and come back and let us know how the mammo goes in November. gb ",

CaIcifications are very common - most of us have them at some time during our lives - especially as we get older. If you continue to be concerned about the itch, keep bugging the doctors until you get satisfaction. Because it is a rare cancer, most doctors haven't seen it and don't recognise it. However, I'm hoping that it is just a mild skin complaint which will disappear with the right treatment. Hope to hear some good news from you soon. I'm keeping everything crossed for you. Jane ",

She didn't even do a biopsy. Her exact words were: \"This needs to come out sooner rather than later. You can wait a few weeks but not months for surgery as this type of cancer can be very nasty if it leaves the ducts\". I came home and read up on DCIS and wondered why on earth there was such a rush for surgery.   Anyway, 4 weeks later I had a lumpectomy. The pathology report said it was \"over 5.5 cm and extensive, grades 2 & 3 DCIS with microinvasion\". My surgeon strongly recommended a mastectomy to which I reluctantly yet readily agreed.  I felt rather pressured about my surgeries but, looking back, I feel that I made the right decision.",

I was just about to wade into the water at the beach when a wave seemed to rise up from nowhere, picked me up and slamed me hard onto the sand. One of my breasts took the full brunt of the impact. The pain was horrendous! I sat down on the shore and groaned as quietly as I could until the pain abated a little. My breast was very colourful over the next week or so! Sometime later (perhaps a year?) my doctor was examining me and felt a lump. I had to have a needle biopsy. It was an old haematoma and was benign so I was so relieved.

I know you are thinking the worst but most lumps are benign and the discharge might be coming from a benign cyst. Mammograms don't always show everything. They will probably do an ultrasound to rule out cysts and get a different angle and maybe an MRI as well. Many people say \"the only good lump is a lump in a jar\" so a biopsy may be in order to get a definite diagnosis.  You are most certainly doing the right thing having diagnostic testing. I am praying that you will soon have a benign result. The waiting is horrible though - your mind just won't let it be.",

I remember discovering a lump when I was about your age while breastfeeding my second child but it ended up being just a milk lump. The fear I felt then is something I will never forget! Anyway, you are absolutely doing the right thing by having your doctor check out your symptoms. Please pursue this until you are satisfied.  It's highly unlikely that this is cancer given your age (yes, there are many women your age and younger who are diagnosed but, statistically, it's unlikely). The fact that you had eczema when you were very young could very well mean that this is what you are experiencing on your nipples. I realise I haven't been much help but, as nobody else has answered, I just wanted to make a comment.  If you are unhappy with your doctor's assessment of this, please see another doctor or preferably, a breast specialist. It's sure to be nothing serious but I'm a great believer in having symptoms checked out.",

I was constantly told that I was lucky to have dcis and so I was very upbeat for most of the period between my dx and surgeries (lumpectomy followed by single mastectomy with snb). About a month after my second surgery, I began to feel very sad, anxious and alone. I worried that they may have missed something and kept replaying what my surgeon and bc nurse had told me re the strong possibility of invasion and further treatments (ie chemo). I asked for a second opinion on my path slides but even after that I worried for a while. 6 months after my mastectomy I had my first mammogram (digital) and I can honestly say that I wasn't at all worried about what they would find. I was certain it would be ok and it was. So, I guess what i am saying is that it is normal to go through a grief and anxiety stage (even with non-invasive bc) but you do come out the other side and life is good again. Some may need anti depressants (maybe I did? Perhaps I would have bounced back more quickly if I had taken them) and/or counselling. Either or both might be very beneficial to you. Hugs, gb ",

Anything like this should be investigated until you have peace of mind or a diagnosis. From what I have read about IBC, once it starts, it does not tend to improve. I think it is hopeful that your mothers mass had tended to come and go with her cycle. It appears to me to be hormone related. When we approach menopause, hormones can cause lots of symptoms.

Having said all that, I know how hard it is not to worry so I suppose I shouldn't tell you that! There are so many other things it could be. There are benign tumors. It could be a cyst - they can be quite large. Fibroadenomas can be large and strangely shaped. How long until you see your doctor? If possible, reassure your children.

It has a small bulge where they did the snb, then it's really flat and right over towards the centre of my chest it's a bit puckered - that's a few adhesions and they block the flow of lymph and it tends to build up there and make things look a bit puffy. I have been having lymphatic massage from a physiotherapist and that really helps. It gets the lymph flowing and, since my wound healed sufficiently, the physio has been working on the scar tissue to help prevent adhesions. Apparently it takes up to 2 years for adhesions to become firmly anchored so if you have pt, they can be gradually broken down and don't stick. There is also kinesio taping which helps to lift the skin and get the lymph flowing. All of these treatments are very gentle and soothing. I asked for a skin saving mastectomy as I thought I might want to have a recon. Therefore, my scar has extra skin around it which makes it a lot less neat. Each to their own but I have decided that recon is not for me. My scar is so much better than it was but I may end up getting a little extra surgery to neaten it up one day - if I can be bothered!  Best wishes, gb ",

I have an appointment to have my usual mammo/us in January. I asked my surgeon for a referral to have a digital mammo and he gave me one but he remains unconvinced that digital has any advantages over conventional. Yesterday, when I rang another breast centre to make an appointment to have a digital, I was initially told I would have to wait until at least March. I faxed my referral, they rang back and said they could fit me in this Monday (12th) so I grabbed it!  (Just an aside - I have been nagging my sister all year to have a mammo and FINALLY she has been to see her dr. She told her doc about my dx and as a result she has been referred to have conventional and digital mammos and ultrasound). Sorry to be so long winded about this but here are my questions: do you think I should keep my appointment for conventional mammo & us in January as well as having the digital on Monday? Would this be excess radiation exposure?  Or would it be worth having the 3 different screenings to rule out anything that is hiding? Why is my surgeon so luke-warm about digital when I have read that they are often better at detecting early DCIS than conventional mammo - particularly in dense breasts? I have also read that digital mammo results in more false positives than conventional.  Any thoughts on my ramblings would be very much appreciated. gb  Dx 2/26/2007, DCIS, 6cm+, Stage 0, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

You might reel back in horror when you read my recipe for a hot toddy but you may find it helps! Peel and chop several cloves of fresh garlic (not grown in China!) and add it to about a pint of cold water in a saucepan. Bring to the boil and then remove from heat. Add some freshly grated ginger root, the juice of a couple of lemons, some chilli powder (or use fresh, chopped chillies) and then add some honey to taste. (I try to use medicinal honey which has antibiotic properties) Let the mixture sit for a few minutes (or longer if you want a stronger flavour!), then strain, reheat and drink when needed. You can adjust the ratio of ingredients to suit your individual taste.

I have read that high grade DCIS is often more compacted into a small area and is therefore easier to treat with lumpectomy and rads - but this is by no means always the case. Eg, Beesie had high grade extensive DCIS. Mine was also extensive, grades 2 & 3 and after having a lumpectomy, my only choice was a mastectomy.  It is best to be guided by your doctors but, in the end, it is your body and you should choose what you are most comfortable with, whether this be lumpectomy with rads or more aggressive surgery. After the lumpectomy, you will have more information and hopefully, this will make it easier to decide. gb ",

I think that a lot of these statements about what bc should feel like are, on the whole, true - ie, perhaps if a survey was taken, a large percenatage of bc patients would not have pain. However, there are plenty of exceptions because each body is different and there are many different types of bc. I'm a firm believer in having all symptoms checked by professionals. I had a spontaneous, blood-stained discharge from my right breast for over a year. I sought  medical advice early, had the discharge sent to pathology and it came back benign. There was no pain. A year or so after that, I turned up for my yearly mammogram & ultrasound and was diagnosed with DCIS - not in the breast with the discharge but in the other breast which had no symptoms whatsoever. The discharge eventually stopped and, apart from frequent cysts in my remaining breast, all is fine 4.5 years later. Chances are, your hard knot and the pain has something to do with the implant but you are most certainly doing the right thing by having it checked.

When I was first diagnosed with DCIS, I went into strong denial - I guess that was my way of coping :-/. Therefore, by the time I turned up for my wire insertion before surgery, the emotions I'd stifled were ready to spill out. I ranted a lot afterwards about the barbarity of such a procedure, but if I had been honest, the whole thing didn't hurt; it was just the thought of what they were doing plus the discomfort of having to sit in a cramped position for so long.The nurse and doctor were unbelievably sweet and kind and I think that partly what made me burst into tear when it was over! Plus the fact that I had bottled up my emotions. My husband wasn't allowed to accompany me so he stayed in the waiting room. It added insult to injury when I discovered him sound asleep in his chair - grrrr!  So, this was what the wire insertion was like for me (5 years ago - things may have changed since then): a) I was seated in front of the mammogram machine and my breast was placed between the paddles b) the area of concern was located c) I was given local anaesthetic and then they waited until my breast was numb (maybe they did this first up?) d) the first wire was inserted - I had to keep very still e) I remember lots of checking and re-checking to make sure the wire was in the right place f) procedure was repeated with 2nd wire g) wires were covered in gauze and taped down h) told my husband off for sleeping! (he's generally very supportive) i) went off to have my lumpectomy. I remember the warm blankets, wonderful pain relief and lovely staff  When I woke up from the anaesthetic, I was asked what my pain level was on a scale of 1-10. I said it was an 8. Within seconds I was given more pain killers and felt no more pain. My scar was about 3 inches long. I wore a firm fitting bra for the next couple of weeks. A seroma formed and I could hear the liquid sloshing around when I walked but it was soon reabsorbed.  Hugs, Jane",

So glad you have a couple of lovely supportive sisters and glad your husband returned but that must have been horrible for you when he left.  I can understand why you want to get all this over and done with quickly. It's much better to know exactly what you are dealing with than let your imagination take over.  I've heard that MRIs give a lot of false positives so the liver spot is sure to be nothing. I've read of so many women being worried by these liver spots and they turn out to be benign. It's still scary for you though. I didn't have any sedation for my wire insertion. I had to remain very still and listen to instructions as I sat there so I think it would be difficult to cooperate if you were sedated to the degree that you couldn't follow instructions. If I had been given more information about the procedure beforehand, I would have definitely dosed myself up to the eyeballs with Valium though! As I said before, it was certainly not painful but the thought of what they were doing and my fear was what did me in. As you normally take some (Ativan, Xanax?) I think you would need to get some pharmaceutical advice as to how much you should take to cope with this. I'd hate you to overdose but it does sound as though you need to up the dose a bit. I hope you can get advice from you doctor beforehand. The staff where you will be having the wire insertion should be made aware of how you feel, even if you exaggerate a bit to get their attention! I had to sit for about an hour to have the wires inserted. It was a bit uncomfortable to sit for so long - I think the most discomfort was in my back, neck and shoulders. Please let us know what happens.",

The one thing I think just about everyone will agree with is that we want this thing out of our bodies asap and it never feels soon enough - yesterday wouldn't have been soon enough for me!  Stress and worry can create all types of physical feelings. I was quite a hypochondriac for the first few months after my surgery. I just didn't trust my body any more and wondered what else was in there that I didn't know about.  This next week will probably go irritatingly slowly for you Barbara. It's terrible that you have to wait but, if it's any consolation, we all know how that feels. Try lots of distractions. Ask your dr for meds to help you sleep at night if you have insomnia. I wish I had done that - every night I was up at 2 or 3 am and I couldn't eat much during the day.   I wish that dear little puppy WAS mine!

However, even though you are a medical student, how can you possibly diagnose yourself with stage 11A breastcancer when you haven't even been examined by a professional? The only way you can diagnose breastcancer is with a biopsy. Experienced breast specialists can often be fairly certain that what they see on a mammogram is cancer but even then, they do not give a diagnosis until they have a biopsy that has been sectioned and put under a microscope.  Please don't assume you have breast cancer but get yourself to a doctor and see what he/she thinks. You may need to be referred to a breast centre or breast specialist.   Young women can and do get breast cancer but it is still comparatively rare. Also, 80% of biopsies are negative for breast cancer and that's across all age groups so, for your age, that percentage is probably higher (for not having bc).  Your hard lump is highly likely to be a fibroadenoma - a very common and benign lump in younger women - but, as I am not a dr, I am not diagnosing you as only a pathology lab can do this.  You don't need to tell your family that you have stage 2a breast cancer. You could certainly tell them of your worries and get some support but nobody knows for certain what this lump is until you have it properly checked and this should be done asap so you know what you are dealing with.

If the DCIS has become invasive, most women seem to have chemo, even after a mastectomy. Breast tissue can extend up under the arms and of course onto the chest wall. After a mastectomy, the pathologist looks carefully at the margins to make sure that no cancer cells have been left behind. If (and this seems to be fairly rare) the DCIS extended into the chest wall, then radiation would probably be required. If the DCIS had become invasive - ie, had gotten out of the milk ducts, it is no longer stage 0 DCIS, but stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma in situ and would require chemo. I was diagnosed with DCIs in Feb this year, just after I turned 50. I was initially told that I would most likely have a wide local excision (lumpectomy), followed by approximately 6 weeks of rads, 5 times each week. However, the DCIS turned out to be extensive, stage 0, grades 2&3 so I was advised to have a mastectomy to which I agreed as well as a SNB (sentinel node biopsy - 2 nodes removed which were clear of any cancer cells). After the path report came back, my surgeon told me I was cured and would need no more treatments - no chemo, no rads and no tamoxifen. I have a higher than average risk of developing breast cancer in the other breast but there's an over 80% chance that I will remain (breast) cancer free for the rest of my life. DCIS, although sometimes requiring mastectomy, is the most curable form of bc.  If you have a unilateral mastectomy, you should continue to have regular screening on the remaining breast using mammograms, ultrasounds, MRI etc. Good luck and hugs for your next surgery.  ",

I didn't want to talk about this before, because each case is different and personal but I had a lump when I was breastfeeding my (then) 6 month old son. I was referred to a surgeon who wanted me to wean my baby immediately and have the lump cut out. Some would say that I was irresponsible but I decided not to wean (after a sleepless night with a screaming baby and a car accident next day due to being freaked out and sleep-deprived!) or have the surgery but instead watched the lump and had follow-up monitoring. The lump decreased steadily until it was gone in a few months. That baby turns 26 on Monday!  I eventually got DCIS (dx this year) and ended up with a mastectomy but that is unrelated to that lump so long ago.  Congratulations and hugs to you and your family.

I felt it was necessary to have it done quickly rather than wait until the right time. So I had it on about day 4 of my cycle - I would have preferred to wait a bit longer but there were no vacancies on the surgical list then. Anyway, it all went well. I had minimal pain. Had a drip for the first 36 hours with patient administered pain relief but I didn't need it after the first 15 hours or so. I had one drain from the sentinel node which was removed on day 3. I had my wound manually drained a couple of times after that and have had lymphatic massage regularly during the 3 months since surgery to keep my lymph problems had bay. Overall, it's been ok with a few ups and downs. Hope it all goes as well as possible for you.",

I'm so glad you found this forum - the women (and a few men too) are wonderful and you will find empathy, love and friendship here. I went to a breast centre, had a mammogram and the doctor told me then and there that it was ductal cancer. She referred me to a bc surgeon at the centre who booked me in for surgery. They didn't do a biopsy of that breast. (They did a fine needle biopsy of the other breast, just to check on a cyst). I had a lumpectomy but as it was extensive, I went on to have a mastectomy. It was high grade. So, I guess that sometimes, a classic case of a particular cancer is obvious to the well-trained eye. Jane ",

It's great that everything has been benign so far but it's annoying and worrying to be subjected to so many call-backs and additional testing. Things could well settle down after a while and you will probably never be diagnosed with breast cancer. However, sometimes, those of us who have had a bc dx had issues with our breasts for some years beforehand. In my case, it was good that I was having regular screening because I was made to be vigilant and, as a result, it was caught at an early stage. I had very dense, fibrocystic breasts and had to have ultrasound as well as mammograms every year. My DCIS was picked up by mammogram. I see that you were diagnosed with bilateral calcifications. Bilateral symptoms are usually benign and many, many women have calcifications - some macro and some micro and they never develop into anything bad. However, in spite of the worry and the nuisance factor of all this breast vigilance, you are doing the right thing.  I'm a great believer in second and even third opinions. These will give you some reassurance. You are managing your health well.  Keep up with your screening and checks. It's a pain I know but it's much better than neglecting your health.",

Those women whose mammograms, ultrasounds, other scans and biopsies that result in a benign result tend to not come back here. There are a few who linger on and give their support to women like you who are scared senseless and thinking the worst and this is great - we need them here - but most are out there living their busy lives and do not need our support. So, I hope that what I say from now on will be reassuring to you rather than worrying. I nearly always have call-backs when I have my mammograms. This is because I have cysts that come and go which can look alarming on a mammogram. Luckily for me, I have my yearly mammogram then I sit in a little waiting room in my pink gown while the radiologist looks at the film. It is just great to not have to wait days for the result. Then, I am usually told that I have to have an ultrasound as there is usually at least one suspicious area. Nearly every time the u/s has revealed that the dark lumpy thing on the mammogram is just a fluid filed cyst and I walk out of there very relieved and happy. My diagnosis of DCIS two years ago was unrelated to the cysts. For the time being, this is the best place for you to be. I'd advise you not to go to other threads where people have already been diagnosed because you will be worried even more than you are now. Please try not to think the worst at this stage. The radiology people are probably just being careful and everything will be just fine. I know how hard it is not to worry though. Please post any time as there will always be someone here for you.

I honestly can't remember if I was numbed before my wire localisation or not...but I do wish I'd had a good dose of valium beforehand - I'm sure it would have made all the difference. NSJ's deep breathing suggestion is a good idea too. After hearing so many horror stories about anaesthesia, I dreaded going under more than I worried about my final pathology. I was sure I'd die from a reaction to it! However, it all went so smoothly. You often tend to get cold when you are stressed so, if you need to, ask for warm blankets to cover you before you go into surgery - it's very soothing to be enveloped in warmth. I remember being wrapped in a pre-warmed toweling robe and it really helped. You will be asked a lot of questions before surgery and weighed so they know what combination of drugs and the quantity to use for your anaesthesia. Praying the whole thing goes smoothly for you.

My surgeon told me that he could aspirate it if it was bothering me but it wasn't unduly sore so I declined. Over the next week or so the fluid in the seroma decreased. I had a mastectomy a few weeks later and had my wound aspirated twice as it was very uncomfortable. The fluid was quite bloodstained when I had it aspirated so perhaps it was a combination of a haematoma and a seroma. gb ",

I hope you are managing to keep away from Dr Google - there are a lot of scary half truths and untruths out there or just information that doesn't apply to your particular case. Best to come here and just vent and get some support. I had yearly mammograms for most of my 40s because I had \"busy breasts\" (dense tissue, muliple cysts and a blood-stained discharge for over a year from one side - the good side by the way). Anyway, just over 5 years ago I turned up for my yearly checkup at the breast centre. They told me that day that I would need surgery (must have been a textbook case as I was diagnosed with DCIS just by the appearance of the microcalcifications on the mammogram). I had a lumpectomy which showed the area of DCIS was quite large (over 6 cms), margins weren't clean so I was strongly advised to have a mastectomy with a sentinel node biopsy. I agreed on the spot (I just wanted it all taken away asap).  I was told by the breast specialist that my chance of recurrence is 1-2%. I have not been taking tamoxifen (I doubt I would have agreed to it even if it had been suggested) and I've only had to have yearly checkups since (my yearly mammo and ultrasound will be next week). I was rather anxious for the first 3 years after diagnosis but I really don't worry any more as it all seems a long time ago and I think I was lucky things were not worse. Hoping and praying that there is no DCIS or anything bad for you. Will be thinking of you in Houston and hope to see you back here soon. Hugs, Jane",

What you are experiencing could be just post-op swelling but best to not take any risks. Swelling under the armpit, around the back and down the side can occur after surgery - particularly after any lymph node removal. If the swelling is due to this, aspiration will give you immediate relief but of course there is a slight risk of infection from having a needle placed in your wound. If the lymph build up continues, you may like to have lymphatic massage - a non-surgical method of freeing up the fluid and helping it to drain into the larger lymphatic vessels. I have found this to be a very gentle, soothing way to bring relief.  Hope you feel much better soon, gb ",

This will be your baseline and future pics of your breasts will be compared to these ones. A technician once told me that the mammogram is a macro-view and the ultrasound is micro-view. Also, ultrasounds are useful for checking out any benign cysts which are normally fluid-filled. I started having ultrasounds in at about 40. Right from the start, they did ultrasounds as well as mammograms and nearly every time, they wanted to do extra ones. Ultrasounds are particularly useful for younger women who tend to have denser breasts. Digital mammograms are also better at picking up very early (and completley curable) breast cancers like DCIS. I know, the first time you get a call back, you think the worst but it is highly likely that there is absolutely nothing wrong and they are just being thorough.  Best wishes gb ",

Mammograms have caused leakage from my breast before - although I already had a spontaneous discharge so my experience may not be relevant to your situation 2. If you can afford a MRI, then I think you should have one. The more techniques used to look at the breast, the better the overall picture is 3. I wouldn't wait 6 months as I'm a person who likes to know. An MRI will help you in your decisions. If it shows nothing, you may decide to either have the ductogram or do the wait-and-see approach over the next 6 months. If it does show something of concern, you will have caught it early It's sure to be a benign condition but, as I said before, I think it's best to be sure and have it checked. ",

In the rapid leadup to the surgery I didn't have any idea how I would feel about reconstruction afterwards so I asked my surgeon to save as much skin as he could in case I did decide to go ahead with it. I had a lot of lymph building up in the months after my surgery and was eventually dx with LE - it's mild but a bit annoying. I have decided not to have reconstruction because I don't want to face more surgery and I have adapted pretty well to my prosthesis. Also, more surgery might worsen my LE. Perhaps one day I might have a simple 'tidy-up' surgery to make my scar neater but I am even shying away from that at the present. I do miss being symmetrical but I generally speaking I am ok with the way I am.  Good luck with your decision.

I have had many cysts over the years and they show up on the u/s as dark oval shapes. I had an ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy on one of them and was surprised at the lack of pain (I had very sensitive breasts) and it was actually quite interesting watching the needle probe about and withdrawing the fluid. They told me shortly afterwards that it was just a fluid-filled cyst - quite benign and harmless. The only reason why they tested this one is because I was about to have a mastectomy on the other side for DCIS & they just wanted to make sure this cyst was clear of malignancy or was not hiding anything else. If they tested all my other cysts, I would be like a pin cushion! Thinking of you and keeping everything crossed that all your results are benign.

I have to admit that my wire localisation didn't actually hurt (I've had far worse pain at the dentist or squeezing a pimple) but my emotional state caused me to see it as barbaric. A rough summary of my thoughts might be something like this: \"We as women are expected to endure having wires screwed into into our breasts while we're fully conscious? Imagine a man having something like this forced into his more sensitive areas!\" This attitude didn't help me much! I really like farmerlucy's adventurous outlook. It's how I tend to be with medical procedures (did I say I hated that word?!) but I'm afraid I was feeling particularly UNadventurous that day. As I said, it didn't hurt but I didn't appreciated having such a sensitive part of my body impaled with long pieces of wire. (Low blood sugar from fasting and the fact that I was approaching my first general anaesthetic added to my lack of bravery). Out of all those bc related procedures (grrrr!) that I had - lumpectomy, radioactive injections for the SNB and the mastectomy, this was the worst thing - for me. Others will argue that it's a piece of cake. Should I post this? I'm in two minds - my intention is not to worry you but to ask you not to approach this experience certain that it's going to be horrible...from what I've read on these boards, most women sail through it. Most will admit that the worst part is having to sit in an uncomfortable position for so long and having to keep still while the machine (I think it's usually a mammogram) checks to see that the wires are in the right position. I kept very still and stoical until my battered breast was released from the mammogram and then I started shaking and crying. The medical team were very comforting thank goodness...if they'd treated me as though I was a crybaby (which I was!) I would have felt like storming out and finding a cave to hide in. Statistically, you are more likely to sail through this than have my experience but if you do find it not much fun, you will know that you aren't alone...Is that just slightly reassuring?

It's probably because it is unusual to have mastitis when you're not breast feeding. However, if you have been diagnosed by a reputable doctor, it must be possible. If the antibiotics do not seem to help the problem, please get a second opinion. Breast cancer is relatively rare in people your age but any changes should be taken seriously. IBC is one of the rarest forms of breast cancer but, once again, anything is possible and you need to be sure this diagnosis is correct. Please get another opinion if the antibiotics are not working.

I'll try not to waffle on but this is my experience with nipple discharge. When I was pregnant for the first time (31 years ago), I read that it was a good idea to gently massage your breasts and try to express some colostrum. So, at about 5 months gestation, I started doing this. There was nothing there but a few days later there were bloodstains on my nightdress. I asked my obstetrician about it and he was unconcerned. He seemed to think it was just early colostrum but advised me not to do any more massage. The discharge continued throughout the pregnancy but disappeared as soon as my milk came in. I successfully breastfed for a long time and gradually weaned my baby during my next pregnancy. I went on to breastfeed my next two children as well. Fast forward to my 40s. I was at the beach. A wave picked me up as I was entering the surf and I was dumped heavily on my breast (can't remember which side now) and a haematoma formed. It gradually seemed to go away but next time I had a mammogram it showed up as a suspicious area and I had a fine needle biopsy. Benign. A few years went by. I started to have a spontaneous bloody discharge from my right breast. Had it all checked out, fine needle biopsy -  benign again - it was just fluid coming from one of my many cysts. It stopped after about a year and I haven't had anything unusual happen with that breast since. My left breast is no more as I was dx with DCIS 2 years ago. Was it related to my accident in the surf? Probably not. Who knows? All is fine now. Somebody on these boards said the other day that, although abnormal, bloody nipple discharge is not usually a sign of cancer.  The tests you have already had are all probably right about your condition being benign but you need to do whatever it is to give you peace of mind. I'm sure there will be others along soon to give you their wisdom. Jane",

As I walked into the water, a wave reared up in front of me and dumped me hard on one breast. The pain was so bad that I just crawled out of the water and lay on the sand moaning for quite a while. Some time later, I had a mammogram and there was a dark, shadowy area on my breast. I had a needle biopsy. It turned out to be a large haematoma that had formed when I injured my breast. You may have had a bleed into your breast too and it could be pressing on the breast tissue and causing pain. (Edited to say that most haematomas simply get reabsorbed over time). I'm a great believer in getting anything you're concerned about checked out. If it's nothing, you get peace of mind, if it's something, you can get treatment for it. Sorry you are worried - it's sure to be nothing of great concern but please get it checked out so that you can live your life without this fear.",

When I told the instructor that I had LE she said to just work at a gentler pace and not do anything that felt too straining of my arm. I enjoyed it so much. The only part that was sore afterwards were my legs. My LE arm felt fine. (That is, until I did some vigorous house cleaning the next day and had an acute flare-up) My LE person told me that the sweeping and mopping I did was sure to have caused the swelling - not the aqua aerobics.  I am sure there will be plenty of ladies along soon who know a lot more about this than I do. Good luck! gb ",

Dh is arriving soon and my friend is staying the night on her way back to Sydney so they will brighten things up a bit. Hi Mel - I hope your hair turned out ok and we won't have to call you Pippy! Actually that's one of the names I had picked out for Blossom! Rather cute I think! I'm so sorry you have this ongoing stress with your SO. I pray that he will have the strength to cut back or give up the grog completely. I'm glad you are doing small things for yourself like experimenting with your hair - it's important to give yourself some TLC. I can really identify with the money problems. My car is up for registration next month, Blossom has to be desexed, the bills are starting to mount up and I need crowns on my teeth too! A packet of cheese has a competition to win a $1,000.000 - I think I'll enter it! Might take a lottery ticket while I'm at it. Sorry to hear about your chipped tooth Shirlann. Dentists cost a small fortune here too. A lot of the poorer people just lose their teeth because they can't afford to see a dentist. I wish they had medicare for dentists. I saw that dreadful crash in LA - so sad. And Hurricane Ike - I haven't checked the latest news on that - I do hope there weren't too many casualties.  Lisa - Dennis must be pinching himself and saying \"Is there anything wrong with this fabulous woman?!\" He must be smitten. And Olivia has a b/f in Florida - is that a long way from you? Oh to be young and in love - the sweetest thing! I am wondering how long it will be before I see my eldest & youngest sons - the eldest has a Polish girlfriend (in London) and the youngest has a Swedish girlfriend (in Finland). I wonder if they will last? It's a long way from home...  Val - you are never boring. It was so good to see you post. A new hair style will give you a lift. Hair - I'm never satisfied with mine - it goes frizzy in humid weather - which means most of summer. Praying that things work out for you and UB financially. Fumi? Hope all is well with you. I can't remember how long you were going to stay in NZ...  Love to you all and also to Karen, Sue, Ulla, Sheila, Judie, Suebee, Kaloni, Ann, Jule, Nancy and anyone else I have missed.

From what I can gather, several of you are having pain and associated stress - Karen, Lisa and Sue (sorry if I have left anyone out - there are others). Sue, have you seen your doc yet? Karen, please ask your dr about the pain. It is highly likely to be nothing serious but I do hate to think of you worrying yourself sick and feeling that you can't burden your family with your fears. What a horrible year you have had. It's time for some good news in the form of NED so that you can cross that off your list of concerns. Lisa, I hope that you will get some reassurance from your drs too. Could all these aches be from tamoxifen or other medications? I have heard so many people say that they have side effects like these. I drove back from my mountain home to my old home today. It was snowing not long before I left! Two days before it had been hot! Crazy weather but I guess springtime is unpredictable. I meant to post again before I left here last time but I was feeling rather unwell. Hopefully, we will be getting the internet on at the new house soon and I can catch up with you all again. I am in the process of making a few social networks, doing some volunteer work, walking, gardening, reading, sketching etc. I have missed you all! Love to you all, Jane xxx ",

You are brilliant! Sue - I hope you are having a fantastic holiday! Melody, I will say a special prayer for you and your SO. Of course he isn't a bad person. I think there is such a range of levels of addiction from those who can take it or leave it and others who have one drink/smoke or whatever and are hooked - so hard to give up. You have stuck by him and given him so much support but I think you are doing the right thing - he knows that you still support him and care for him but you need to protect yourself and give yourself a break - it could well be that this separation might give him some perspective. I hope I am saying the right things here - I have only read your most recent post and don't know the recent happenings so I am not very up to date.  Will try to read more tomorrow.

I love all the pics - especially the watercolour of the Christmas tree - so pretty! Judie - you have worked so hard but I sense your feeling of achievement and I think it's a good omen. I love your view - wow! I hope the storm doesn't wreak too much havoc. My niece who lives in Ontario rang the other day to say they were having a whiteout with strong winds and swirling snow. I hope your son has a safe trip over the pass. Is that the road over the Rockies? My eldest son had a hair-raising trip with a truckie over the mountains to Calgary when he was in BC last month. It rained, snowed, and threw just about every type of weather at them. Oh, btw, we say 'moving' in Australia! Sometimes I re-type things when I post here because I suspect I might be saying it in a weird way. The weather is extreme everywhere. We had snow here at the end of last month and it's summer!! (Well, technically, it was the end of spring). Last night it got down to 6C (that's 41F) which is pretty cool for a summer's night but I love the cool weather in the mountains. (I wonder if I will change my tune when I'm shivering next winter?) Nana - I have been thinking of you today - big hugs to you and please know that you are in my prayers.  Karen, hope you miss out on the wild weather too. How's dear old Tinker going?

After the arrival of the infant, my niece and her dh thought it was a good idea to go out to dinner, shopping etc as much as possible while granny was there to look after the new bub. My sister would ring me and say how nervous she was (even though she is a mother of 3 herself) - every hiccup, wheeze or grunt made her worry the tiny creature was choking or on the verge of some health crisis! She felt so relieved to hand the baby back to her parents when they walked through the door. Full-time care of an active 2 - 3 year old would be much more exhausting. Perhaps it doesn't matter how laid-back you are as a parent - when it comes to grand-parenting, the responsibility must be much greater, plus lack of practice and being ever so slightly older! I'm sure you are doing a fantastic job but drugs and warm, lavender-scented, candle-lit baths after Connor is asleep at night might be a good idea. This time will pass and you will have good memories. I wish I'd had a mother like you when my kids were young - my mother has always been very un-grandmotherly!",

      "Content": "Apr 26, 2008 12:56AM - edited Apr 26, 2008 01:09AM by geebung Wow Mel! What a sweet kitty Lilly is! I love her pink lips - such femme fatale! She's also a princess with her own palace. She is so lucky to have you as her special human! I love the marmalade bits on her head. She is what we call a tortiseshell - I think they are also known as calico cats? I read somewhere that  such cats are nearly always females. I had one once called Samantha and she was such a sweet cat. Yesterday, the kids from next door came in to give me a letter they had written me - it was so cute! Their little tabby kitten came in with them. I knelt down and patted him and he was so friendly and sweet. The children went home and I came back inside. Next minute Charlie (the kitten's name) was hanging half-way up my screen door, yowling to come in! I went out and told him he should go home and he started purring and rubbing his head against the screen door. I felt like catnapping him!  Karen, I have heard that pugs are such sweet little dogs - very loyal and loving although I haven't known one personally. Most men seem to like biggish dogs - more macho! I like them in any size but I have my heart set on a whippet - preferably a black and white one but I have a feeling they would be quite expensive. I have read up on all the breeds and a whippet sounds like just the sort of dog I want. They are said to be very affectionate,  enjoy exercise but love to curl up on a sofa with you. There's a great website called \"whippetwear\" and the dogs are wearing the most gorgeous clothes - they are parading on a catwalk (ha ha!) like supermodels. The clothes are pretty expensive though so I would have to try to make something similar as whippets feel the cold.  Settlement is this coming week on the mountains house. My o/h is taking a couple of weeks off soon to help get my house ready for renting. It's an old house (cute but run down) and needs lots of repairs so it's going to take some time to get everything up to a reasonable standard. I am on 2 weeks holiday from my classes. I can't say I am enjoying it all that much. I love the social aspect - my classmates are such a great bunch of people but the subject matter is often very depressing. I live on the edge of an area that has a high rate of unemployment, crime, drug abuse, teen pregnancies and child abuse. It's very sad and every week we have had  guest speakers who trot out the miserable statistics. Usually, it's a case of generation upon generation of unemployment and degradation, too many children, illiteracy and hopelessness. I hope that I can be of some use somewhere...one of these days. My neighbourhood is an unusual mix of wealth and poverty - the haves and the have nots. My neighbours on one side fit the latter category and even though I have supported them as much as I am able, they are still in a very hard place. I feel particularly sorry for their children and their numerous animals - both are neglected and yelled at from dawn to dusk. I hope I don't sound patronising - it could have have been me in such a predicament - divorce, single motherhood, 3 kids...but I had parents who valued knowledge and hard work so I was one of the lucky ones. But even now, there are educated people who work hard but end up losing their homes and have a hard time so it's a tough life for so many people.  I think the most important thing is that people be enabled to help themselves. You can't just give handouts as it just causes dependency and a downward spiral. It's often easier said than done though. Anyway, sorry everyone for raving on. Look at where we are up to - nearly 200 pages of posts! We are a \"talkative\" lot! I am going to a comedy show tonight and have been up since 5.30am so I am going to try to have a catnap. Hugs to all, Jane ",

You will have great memories! Karen - that video was so sad. What an amazing woman - so dedicated to her dog and really enjoying the moment. I don't know how she can run like that when she is so sick - she must have such a wonderful spirit. I wonder how she is right now... Lisa - all my best thoughts and prayers for your u/s results. Another darned wait for results - you've had enough of that to last you a lifetime. It's sure to be nothing but the waiting is no fun. I'm so glad your hair is looking great - can't wait to see some pics! Wow Nancy - you certainly had a birthday blast! Great to hear that you had a good time. Hi Jule! How's your Libby? (I hope I haven't got mixed up here - you are the one with the new dog, aren't you?)! Would love to see some pics of her. Hi Mel! Hope you are having a good sleep!  Hi also to Annie and Kaloni - lovely to hear from you both. Karen, how are you feeling a few days post rads? You will probably be tired for a while so don't push yourself too hard. You have fought stinking bootface so well and now your experience will help newbies here. You are wonderful!  Sue - I hope you are getting some sleep! When is your next day off? I'm so glad you like your homies! Nice people make such a difference. I just hope your employers aren't working you beyond what you can stand. Lucy - hope you are having a wonderful time with your guy - come back and say hi sometime!

Isn't that great about your daughter's trip to Europe! And such a great price! She will have such an exciting time. I haven't been to the Netherlands - the only european countries I have visited are France, Germany and Belgium. My youngest and oldest sons have just arrived in London and are about to start work there. My youngest is going to teach and my eldest is going to do labouring work until he gets some design/photography work. They are so excited and happy to be there. They are staying with a school friend who is working there until they find their own place. Lisa - good luck with getting some support out of your ex! I so hope the court rules in your favour. I cannot understand why some non-custodial fathers are reluctant to support their kids. My kids' father was also very slack about paying but as he held a regular job I was able to get it taken out of his pay - I didn't want to do it but his payments were always late and insufficient for his income.  My boys say he is mellowing a bit and they now have a reasonable relationship with him.",

Sue - are you working all weekend? When is your next day off? Hope you are sleeping ok and having some happy moments. Karen - I loved those comments from children - so sweet and funny. \"Mums know how to talk to teachers without scaring them\"! I did laugh over that! And \"Mothers don't do spare time\"!  Priceless! Is it Mothers Day next Sunday (11th) in the US? Judie - I love your pics. You look great with grey hair and your kids are lovely. Photos are so precious - first thing I would save after people and pets in a house fire! Hi Mel! I know what you mean about the time difference. I have to stop and think too - even with the seasons! I sometimes stop and think - \"Are we headed into winter or spring\"? It's partly because of all the contacts I have overseas and also, at this time of the year, the temperatures are similar in the northern and southern hemispheres in many places. I think that it's going to be 21C in London and Toronto today and that's what it will be here too. I've got a 'personal world clock' on my desktop so I just click on it if I want to see the times in the places where I have friends or family.  Hi AE & UB - hope UB is feeling a bit better. I must away and do some chores. Love to everybody and please do something that makes you feel happy this weekend. For some reason a saying just popped into my mind \"Hyacinths to feed the soul\". I don't know where that came from but I like the sound of it. Hugs, Jane xxxx ",

I hope they will get back together again when he gets back to Australia...but if not I will have to show him Olivia'a picture! Lol! Karen - your house is lovely! I love how it's so bright and light and cheerful inside. My house was also moved from another location. The front part is a lot older - (about 1920s?) and the kitchen, bathroom etc was built onto the back of that). It's funny to see houses going along the freeway on the back of trucks! Am I right in thinking that your area is semi-rural? If so, it's similar to where I live. I can walk out into the countryside in 10 minutes and see cows, horses and kangaroos. That's what I should be doing now but I got sidetracked by everyone's fabulous photos and posts. Must go and get some exercise in a minute. Even though I love the lightness of white in a house, a few years ago my middle son painted a couple of feature walls brown in two rooms and it looks really cosy. So AE, I am open to different colour schemes and brown can look great! Love your cosy colour scheme in your bedroom - very pretty, restful and sleep-inducing. Sheila - how wonderful that your dear son is coming home! You must be so excited! I had to laugh about his lack of warm clothing. James and Will have just arrived in London - they flew there from the steaming tropics. I suggested they take some warm clothes but did they listen to me?! No - of course not - it's fun to travel light with not much more than a loincloth. So they arrived in the UK last week and are complaining of the cold...hmmm... Ulla - I love your beautiful family pics - what a cute little sister! My sister is 10 years older than I am and used to be like my mother! We feel much closer in age now that I am older - if that makes sense. Sue - the elephants look so funny and are a great way to attract people into  Subway! Follow the elephants. You could have elephant footprints all through the streets leading to your shop!  Lisa - your house is so pretty - I love the garden - that flowering tree - too beautiful! Heath (middle son - the one with the long hair) just looked over my shoulder at Olivia's pic and said \"mmm...I think I could handle an arranged marriage!!\" Lol! Well, must stop gasbagging and go for my walk. Love to everybody including those I haven't mentioned here but I don't want to make this any longer! Jane xxx ",

Goodness - your poor brain must have been aching, trying to remember all those things! The research sounds really interesting though - I would really like to hear what they discover from their findings. Sue - I love your photos. Zippy is beautiful and David - well, he is gorgeous - I love his kind, wise, twinkling eyes! It's so great to hear you sounding stronger - you are fantastic! Love you heaps! Melody - Sweet Pea sounds like such a loveable, mischievous little package - her name is perfect - love it! I wish she hadn't deleted your post though! Lisa - how exciting to hear from Danni - she sounds as though she is revelling in every moment - what wonderful memories she will have. I bet the Italian men are flirting with her! Charlie was in again today for food and multiple cuddles and also to direct the renovations. My neighbours just got another dog - that's 5! I wish I could kidnap all their animals and give them a good life. AE - I love your patio - very nautical and unique. That chair is great! I love its natural look. I would love a table made from a slab of beautiful wood with free form natural chairs... Shirlann - your weekend sounds like a blast! Exhausting but so much fun. I hope you get your computer back soon... Ulla - it was so interesting to read what you said about crowns. I've often thought that I would love to get all my teeth crowned...not that I could ever afford it though! Anyway, I do have one tooth that needs a crown. A bit broke off and I will need a crown on it before too long. My dentist put a tempory, plastic-type of filling on it. I am such a coward at the dentist and demand lots of pain relief, including happy gas (nitrous oxide). Hi Jule! Always good to hear from you!  Nancy - such a beautiful photo of the rainbow! I love seeing everyones' photos. Last week I was driving along the freeway on a rainy afternoon and suddenly there was such a huge, double rainbow above me. I have to admit that it was a struggle to keep my eyes on the road!  Judie, my mother seems to be living in a fantasy world. It's as though she has travelled back to childhood. She talks about her mother, her siblings and old friends as though they are all still around her. My sister has leaned to just act as though this world is real. If she were to suggest that these people were not really there, it would be distressing for my mother. We both hope that this internal world makes it easier for her. I am hoping to visit her soon - she lives in another state. I hope she recognises me. My sister told me that she usually looks uncomprehending when my name is mentioned...  Sheila - looking forward to seeing pics of you and John together. Hello and love to all the above people and everyone else. I want to meet you all!! Jane xxx ",

It's a tough one and I hope you can come to a decision you feel comfortable with soon.  I love, love love all the pics! Wow Lisa - you and your friends look gorgeous! What fun it must have been!

You do NOT look like a moose! You look lovely! Anyway, I think moose are very sweet so it wouldn't be bad if you did look like one! Sheila - I loved your description of Penelope's behaviour when you try to exercise - what a darling she must be! Sue - I'm so glad you are going to see an LE person - hope you can get some relief soon.

I, and quite a few others have rung the animal welfare people and my neighbours have been taken to court on several occasions. However, they keep getting more animals. I rang my local council and asked if there was a restriction on how many animals were aloud in my area and was told \"no restrictions\"! I rang the RSPCA about one of their dogs who is constantly locked up in a cage and never taken for walks and was told that they require 24 hour video footage as proof before they will charge them. Well, who is going to climb up a tree and focus a video camera down on their back yard?!! They would immediately go into damage control. These people are well known to police and numerous other authorities. They deal in drugs and are prone to angry outbursts. They are scary! Love to all my beautiful sisters and UB, xxxx ",

I know that chaotic feeling when you move - so hard to know where to begin unpacking. Just whittle it away and pace yourself - it will get done eventually! Agnes sounds like the cat Ihad before Possum. He hated cuddles. The temperature would have to be down near freezing point before he would submit to such behaviour. Yet he loved sleeping on my bed on cold winter nights. He was such a character! Anne - how scary! I can't begin to imagine what it must feel like to have had your house invaded by a bear. I do hope the deterrents work and they can relocate your hairy intruder. When I was in the US in the mid 1980s there were chipmunks everywhere which we fed with peanuts. After a couple of weeks of cooing over them and feeding them by hand, we saw a notice telling people not to feed them - that they might carry rabies!They were such cute little things. Where I walk in the mornings there are lots of kangaroos. There is a pretty female with a joey in her pouch and she always stands still, watching me until I get quite close to her (the joey has a good look at me too!) before she laboriously hops away. The joey is almost too big for her pouch but it must be cosy for him/her. I was thinking the other day that it is a good thing they only eat grass - imagine if they were carnivors! I don't think I would be walking anywhere if they were! Melody - I don't think I will be moving for a while. My dh is doing the repairs to my house with occasional help from mates but...it's taking a long time as he only has the weekends to do the renovations. He's rather slow - even though he does a good job! I think it will be a while before we move. I will try to get a photo - I'm out of practice with photobucket - I'll have to relearn what to do. Sheila, when I met my first husband in 1976 he was a big ABBA fan. I wasn't all that keen in those days - I liked heavier stuff! But they were a great group and their music has stood the test of time. I wanted to see Mamma Mia last week but was too busy. It sounds like a wonderful hour or so of joyful escapism. Nancy -  I echo what Judie said about how well you cope with your treatments. Are you extremely brave or have they not been too bad? I'm so glad you are healing well although I'm sure you must be still sore. How are you managing with housework, shopping etc? I hope the change of premises doesn't prove to be too disruptive and that you get a comfy chair. Jane xxx ",

When I was a kid, we lived on a farm with a big, beautiful river. I used to love swimming there - usually naked as there was never anyone else around. One day I ran under the willows to play. Pretty soon I started to scratch. It nearly drove me crazy! I was covered in a rash - it was from the furry catapillars which build their nests in the trees. Boy - I never did that again!",

It really does sound like an infection...sorry to be so enthusiastic about an infection but it sure beats the alternative! Shirlann - lol!! A genital hug - that did make me laugh!

My sister, who had her first child in the early 70s noticed a huge change in attitude between then and when she had her last child in the late 70s - the hospital was so much more relaxed - in a good way. Sheila - I do hope that storm passed and your niece is safe. I didn\"t have steroids and I have still gained weight since my dx. I think I haven't been active enough and maybe (!) a bit of comfort eating here and there...?! Mel - what a lovely long post from you - love the pics as usual.

Sorry to hear you are still not feeling 100%. Sinus is horrible. I've only had it twice in my life but it really makes you feel bad. Hope you can kick it soon.

I can imagine how busy you are. Good luck with it all. Karen, Chase sounds like such a darling. I'm glad his first day wasn't traumatic for him. So sweet of him to be sympathetic to the whiner!

Nancy, hope you are feeling better each day and have a great weekend. My dh is here working on the renovations and a friend of ours is arriving soon. 4 or us are going out to dinner tonight. I have a warm little cat curled up next to me...she's Possum's sister and about a week after Possum died she gave me a meaningful look in the driveway - as if to say: \"Please can you be my special human now?\" How can you say no to such a sweet creature? If her owners cared about her, she wouldn't be snuggling against me right now. She was hungry and thin but has blossomed since I have been looking after her. Such a pretty little smoky grey girl with marmalade highlights and white paws. Well, must get up and do some work.  Love to all of you and also to Jule, Kaloni, Ann, Suebee and anyone else I have missed. Jane xxx ",

The therapist strokes the lymph from where it is building up to larger drainage channels. Sometimes they apply kinesio tape to encourage the fluid to drain away. I remember the first time I had the tape put on, I went home feeling almost normal again. Six months post surgery I still get a bit of lymph buildup under my arm and also at the other end of my mastectomy wound. Yesterday my lymph therapist taped me again and I feel so much better. I joined up with Curves a couple of weeks ago and find that their circuit training is helping too. Hugs, gb  ps - I have had a prosthesis for a bit over a month and I don't find it very comfortable either. When I walk through my front door, the first thing I do is take it off. It is particularly uncomfortalbe on my mastectomy side. Sometimes I think I should have had a bilat so I would have symmetry.",

I think I'm ok -  a bit of sadness over my mother and just the winter bleakness. We had a few sunny days last week and it was so good to feel the warmth. I do like cold weather but days and days of fog and cold are a bit depressing. I don't feel really sad, just unmotivated and I hate that. Time seems to go and I am not achieving anything. Really though, I shouldn't feel down. There is so much to be thankful for - hopefully, it's just a passing phase. My mum is still hanging in there but her quality of life is so poor. Her medical people say she is not in pain. She will turn 92 this Friday. Several months ago we thought she wouldn't see this birthday. Mel, I hope you believe all the affirmations of your sweet, dear self that your sisters have written. Every word of it is true. You have had such a lot of stress in your life - no wonder you feel low. I hope you feel better soon. I feel useless too, if that's any help! Sweet Sue, hope you feel better soon too.

I often feel inadequate to give truly empathetic support as I had DCIS and mastectomy - no chemo or rads. I was very fortunate to get off so lightly. And I haven't had reconstruction and probably won't. I was dx over 2 years ago now and I finally feel as though it's in the past and I am feeling almost normal again - yet I will never take my health for granted again and I think I have lost a lot of confidence in my body.  Maybe as result of this moving on phase I seem to be going through, I had all my hair cut off about 10 days ago. I thought I might regret it but I love my very short silver tufts - for me, at this stage of my life, it's very liberating! I was just so sick of dying my hair as I started to go grey in my late 20s.

We were both very surprised when pathology came back as a 'squamous cell carcinoma' which is a malignant type skin cancer. Luckily, the margins were clear. I am so glad that I had it removed quickly. Now I have another suspicious looking mole on my back which I am seeing the doc about next week. Anyway, enough waffle about me. I think you should have your spot checked out asap.

Sue, I think my youngest son had swine flu last weekend. He rang me Saturday night and said he had a temperature and was aching all over. He is a teacher and several kids at his school have it. He felt a lot better on Sunday and was feeling 100% by Wednesday. The media has made a huge fuss about it here and a few people have died but quite a lot of people die from normal flu each year. Most people don't get H1N1 badly - I heard one man being interviewed on tv and he said he'd had \"worse paper cuts!\" The countries in the southern hemisphere are the main focus of this flu at the moment but, with all the flights around the world, it will continue to spread. Hopefully, by the time the northern hemisphere countries start heading into winter, the vaccine will be widely available. They are starting human trials soon in Australia.",

Karen, how are you feeling about Portia not going to live with her grandma? I suppose you are kind of happy about it but also wondering how you are going to stand more stress and tension between her and Chase and your dh. Parenting is hard, single parenting is harder and blended families and step parenting present other problems. None of us realise what's ahead when we first hold those dear little babies in our arms!   Barbe - hope your Mic Jagger can be extracted with the least invasive procedure. It all sounds too painful - the whole business - hope you will be blissfully bombed out with drugs before and after. Lisa, that's disappointing about your friend not being able to see you.

Lisa - wonderful to hear your scans were clear! Sorry to hear about Wayne's accident but so glad he wasn't hurt. Hope you can meet him soon. Have a great time in Florida with Olivia! Sue - my heart ached for you when I read about the conversation you had with your Dad. As a parent, I can understand that he did not want to worry you but I think, when things have calmed down a bit, that you should tell him that you really do want to know what is going on with him - always. I also felt so sad for you, missing your sweet Mum - we all feel the need to be able to talk to our mothers and feel their comfort and wisdom - no matter how old we are, but to lose your mother at such a young age...I can only imagine how horrible that would be. Thinking and praying for you and your dad. Barbe - I hope MJ shows up and can be dealt with very severely, once and for all! UB & AE - prayers and hugs to you both for a good outcome at the doctors'.  Mary, Linda, Helen, Meg, Debbie, Nancy, Shirlann, Cathi, Elaine, Sheila, Karen and everyone - hugs and love to you all, Jane xxx",

I really need to start doing some weights and tummy exercises. Low carbs seems to be the way to go to lose weight but, if I lose all the weight I need to, I hope I can keep it off on some sort of maintenance plan. Time will tell... Leesa - my best wishes for your final surgery. Cathi - you are doing a wonderful thing to open your house to your family - it must be tough! And hard to find some 'me' time and to know when to give advice and when not to! Hi Judie! Come back soon! Blossom (my dear little cat) has disappeared. I let her have time outside two days ago and she hasn't returned. We have searched, letterboxed the area, placed notices everywhere, put an ad in the paper but still no sign of her. I miss her - she was such a loving little thing.

It all depends what you are trying to depict. That one is purely for humour but, underneath it all, I cringe because I don't think overweight women should be laughed at - I guess I was laughing at the very similar shape to the garlic. That's very contradictory I know. Typical me - I rarely see things in black and white! Enjoy your peaceful house. Love the photos on FB of your house erection! It's really growing now - you will have the roof on soon. I lost 2 more kg in the past month but my weight loss is slowing. I have now lost 4 kg altogether which isn't a huge amount but my clothes are all really loose so that makes me happy. My doc wants me to have a pelvic ultrasound to check for abnormalities.

I was also one who didn't know or missed that news about your S/O. I'm so glad he is now getting better and is receiving better treatment from a much better hospital and doctor. That first hospital and that nurse! That was dreadful! I hope he is back to much better health soon.

It's always so good to have a live model and the time flew. We did 2 minute warm-up sketches to begin with and proceded to longer poses to allow shading and more detail.

I know its scary but it will soon be over and you will look be able to look forward to your reconstruction in Feb - great perky boobs are not far away! Sue, I had a \"fluffy\" for months after my mastectomy and when I first got my silicone number, it felt pretty strange but I am so used to it now and you can't tell the difference when I am dressed. It is nice to feel balanced but when I am at home, cleaning, like I am today, I go without a bra and that feels ok too. If anyone comes to the door I will swing a towel over my shoulder! David sounds like a darling. He must be such a support to you. There is often one child that feels like your soulmate - my eldest is probably the one I am closest to. My 3 sons just rang me from Bali, the dear things. The middle one will be back on Sunday but the other two are just beginning their travels. I miss them but love hearing about their adventures. There is a bond that goes beyond distance.  Hugs (extra ones for you Lisa) gb ",

Lisa - you are gorgeous on the outside as well as the inside and such a lovely daughter! You look very young too - could pass as your daughter's sister! Lilly is such a sweet cat - we call that colour tortoiseshell here but I think I prefer the term calico. I think all (or most) cats of this colour are females. So sorry everyone has been having a downer lately. Hot flashes/flushes are the worst. This is why I hate summer! Yesterday it was 35 degrees (Centrigrade!) in my kitchen. I thought I was going to blow up! What with the hot flashes and high temps - very hard to take. Luckily I have a little flat/mini apartment at the back of my house that has air con so my partner and I spent the afternoon out there and just made dashes into the house if we needed something. Today it is cooler and raining and it's a welcome relief. I have to have my first post-dx ultrasound this afternoon and see my bc surgeon. (I had a digital mammo in November and it was clear) so I am not really worried about the u/s but it will be nice to be told that the u/s is clear too. Mel, will be waiting to hear how your sister's test results went. Praying that they will be very benign. So good to see Ulla's post. So sorry your LE is giving you pain. It is just so unfair that you have to have this discomfort along with everything else. Have you seen a LE specialist? Sue, I don't want to sound twee, but you are such a beautiful person. Somebody here said that people who really love you will love you no matter what. Look how much we all love you!! Even before I had bc and mastectomy, I would sometimes see pictures of women with mastectomies and the main feelings I got were huge admiration for them and the idea that this is a different type of beauty. I wish I could do some sort of artistic representation of this new beauty. Photography, sculpture - I am not sure but the women who battle this disease just fill me with respect and love. Wren, I am trained as an elementary school teacher too. I trained late in life and graduated 2 years ago. The first year after that I did relief/casual teaching and the second year (last year) I got bc and had my mastectomy. I found teaching sooo stressful and am hoping to get a job in some other area. My dream is to write and illustrate a children's book but meanwhile I just want to get a job so I can afford to buy paints and other arty stuff as well as pay the bills. My partner gave me some water colour paints and some brushes yesterday so that's a start! Thanks for the lovely story Shirlann - you always have something uplifting to say to us. You are so lovely! Auntie Em - go the bra and panties - that's more than I was wearing yesterday! No, not naked! I just had a sarong wrapped around me. Help! I will miss my appointment! Must rush! Hugs, love gb ",

Lisa, good luck with all the tests at the hospital - hope everything goes really, really well for you. May you have the best recon possible! I can't remember what type you are having. I wish I had the guts to have reconstruction. Mostly I try not to think about my mutilated body but every now and then I will have a sudden sad thought and tears will come and I wish I could be a have it done. The main thing that is stopping me is that ever since my surgery in April last year I have had lymph build up in my scar and under my arm and I don't want to make it worse with more surgery. It's actually been quite good this week so maybe it's finally starting to abate. I would so hate to get lymphodema. Instead I try to see a type of beauty in my body - something strong which is a symbol of survival and hopefully a stronger me. I don't feel very strong at the moment though - the early morning hours are a bad time to be awake thinking too much! Sorry to hear that Olivia is still sick. I am sure the sight of her dear mother coming in the door will help her to feel a little better.  Sheila, it's hard to imagine such cold weather at the moment as I sit here in my summer nightdress. Although it is almost cool at this time of the morning. It's raining and I can hear the gutters overflowing. Sounds as though you would prefer to have crisp snow than the sleet. I guess you will have to be very careful of black ice. I was surprised to learn that most people don't put chains on their tyres in snowy climates - I don't know how the all-weather tyres manage not to slip and slide on the roads. Although we do hear of multi car pile-ups sometimes. Sue, I am sending you many healing wishes - I so hope that you can really rest and feel better. I'm really really angry with your boss - how can he sleep at night, knowing that he has robbed his hard working staff? The whole situation really stinks. I think we should all storm across to England and demand that he pays you every last cent! My middle son, Heath, sent me a text message yesterday to say that he is loving every minute of his trip to the US. He was in LA and said that everyone is being SO nice to him! When he arrived at LA he bumped into a girl who used to go to his school and she had just had a baby. What a small world! Thinking of you all. I just checked on world times and it's just after 9am Thursday on the west coast and lunch time on the east coast of the US, 6pm in Sweden and in London it's just after 5pm - all on Thursday. So some of you are just starting work, others are having lunch and it's already dark where Ulla and Sue live. It's 4am Friday here - sigh! Well, I am going to have a warm cup of something and try to go back to sleep. love to all gb ",

When I walk in the door it's restful, quiet and beautiful and her bath is beautiful - I can't wait to have a bubble bath. My bath is a funny shape  but hers sort of cradles you and I can go to sleep without falling under the water. And Oliver is a sweet cat - can get my pet fix.

That first year out of uni I was unable to get a full time job so I did casual teaching and it nearly killed me! The kids have a real attitude to casual/relief teachers who turn up out of the blue if their regular teacher is having a sick day (or can't stand facing her/his class that day -lol). They can make your life hell and you tend to often feel  alienated from the other teachers because you haven't built up relationships with them so you don't get much support. (Although some schools were better than others). It wasn't long before the stress just really got to me and I started making excuses when schools rang to ask me to teach. Then I got bc and that wrote off last year. So now I am going to try again but not as a fully fledged teacher. I want to be a teachers' aide so I can get my confidence up and maybe go back to being a teacher. I am not sure but I just have to try again. I also plan to do a part time course in mental health just in case I discover that teaching really isn't for me. I did find it encouraging that this nice principal I spoke with yesterday told me that he had a similar experience with casual teaching - and that was after he had already been a full time teacher for some years!

Congratulations beautiful girl on finishing chemo! I know you still feel quite sick but it will get better. Big hugs! Mel - I think your hair looks great! And I think it should be very encouraging for the girls whose hair hasn't grown back yet to see how thick and lustrous it is!  And I haven't seen any fat people in any of the lovely photos so stop it everyone - you are all lovely! Why are we so hard on ourselves? Men get beer bellies and poke them out proudly and pat them! If we put on a few pounds we agonise over it! I haven't been game to post any photos of myself here - partly because I am not sure how to and partly because I hate photos of myself! I would so love to lose 20 pounds. I quite like ginger tea with lemon but if you hate the taste it wouldn't be very nice to have to force yourself to drink it. Also, I am not sure where our fresh ginger is grown but I have a sneaking suspicion that it's from China and there has been so much publicity in the media about pesticides being at very toxic levels in Chinese grown produce.  Sue and Ulla - your sore arms - so sorry you have this to suffer with as well. Have you been diagnosed with lymphedema or is it post surgical edema? Even though edema is painful and annoying doesn't necessarily turn into LE. Mine has flared up the last few days too and is painful and feels bulky. Have been massaging it but nobody can massage like my wonderful p/t and my next appointment isn't for a couple of weeks yet.  The anniversary of my dx is coming up too - Feb 26. I remember thinking I could see a shadow on my right breast this time last year. (I had bleeding from it for about 18 months and my docs were keeping an eye on it. I had a needle biopsy but it was benign. It was my left breast which had cancer all through it - lucky for me it hadn't infiltrated but I was told it almost certainly would have. Cold packs are absolute necessities! I keep them in the freezer/ice box and whip them out as soon as I get a hot flash. I put one on my head, one around my neck and one on my back and suck ice cubes at the same time. At night I just lie there and sweat!  Everyone is asleep now. Hope you all have a restful night. love, jane. xxx ",

My SIL has coughed for years and my SO has been asked if he is a smoker by a doctor because he has allergies and coughs a bit. I think a lot of people have congestion in the lungs to varying degrees. Because of the bc, your doc is being extra cautious which is a good thing I guess - I just hate that you have to worry about this when you should be feeling relieved that your chemo has finished. Lisa, I am thinking of you in the leadup to your surgery on Monday. It's hard waiting but it will soon be over and we will all be cheering for you! How long will you be in hospital? Please don't feel bad about your ex. This might pull him up and make him see how neglectful and wrong he has been. You did it for your precious daughters. Heck - as if you haven't been through enough! he's the one who should be feeling guilty! Mia - so glad to hear that you have your last chemo next month. It's frustrating that you have to wait a day longer but it will be so great to have it behind you at last. Sheila - that is such great news about your insurance! It's a pity you had to fight to get this through - it should be accepted that this is all part of your treatment for bc! Angie - thinking of you. Hope your latest treatment hasn't left you feeling too dreadful. I'm so glad you joined this thread. Barbie, I think you have done your grandkids a lot of good by educating them about bc. They are sure to be more proactive in their health checks. Love the dancing kitties, AE! One of these days I am going to sit down and work out how to do this photobucket thing. Might have to wait until I get one of my boys back in town to show me how to do it. Pearl, there is a member of this forum who goes under the name of Tim Tam. If you pm her, she will tell you how to upload photos.  Sue, Ulla, Shirlann, Karyll (please let us know how you are), Cyndy, Mel, and everyone else - will catch up with you at the weekend.

Please don't give up. Ulla's husband - what a wonderful man! Thank you for posting about our dear Ulla. What a great gift to give her - a new laptop! I can't wait to hear from her again. ((((((((((Lisa))))))))) - I forgot about your computer being down and was starting to worry. Thank you so much for posting. So great to know that you are doing ok. It's going to be exciting to hear about your new 'girl' and the lifted one as they heal up and progress to their full beauty! Wren  - gentle ((())))s to you as you recover from your fill. I am so sorry you are in so much pain. I hope it gets better soon. All you women who have recons - you are so brave. I don't think I can do it!  Karen, you have been through so much too and now you have another surgery next week as well as rads soon. No wonder you feel down, tired and struggling at times yet you, like the other wonderful women here, keep on encouraging everyone. You are a such a sweet thing and am sending you my warmest thoughts and love. Hugs also to AE, Shirlann, Angie, Valsul, Barbie, Karyll, Sheila, Melody, Tender, Pearl, Tender and Mia and everyone. Love, Jane  xxxx",

We had a philosophical discussion last class about Mr. Heinz, his terminally ill wife and a phamicist. It is one of those ethical senarios. The pharmacist found a cure for the disease that Mrs. Heinz had and he told Mr Heinz that the vial of medicine would cost $100,000. Mr H didn't have anything like that much money. He loved his wife very much and wanted her to stay with him so one night, he broke into the pharmacist's laboratory and stole the medicine that would cure his wife. Did he do the right thing? We had to break into groups and discuss whether Mr H was right or wrong in his actions. The group I was in was unanimous in saying he was right. It was very interesting to hear the different arguments for and against Mr H's actions in the other groups.  My permission to teach has not come through yet so I am having to put my teachers aid work on hold for a little longer. It always takes ages to get the permission because there are so many new teachers waiting for their clearances. i have not seen Mr/Ms Blue Tongue since he licked my shoe.

I didn't have chemo either but I have put on weight. My mastectomy sent me into instant menopause (well probably more like perimenopause) and, even though I have been going to the gym I can't seem to lose it. I think I have been a bit depressed on and off since dx as I have no 'get up and go' and have to really force myself to clean the house (last time I did some serious cleaning, it sent my le into an acute phase & am still trying to get the swelling down!). There is so much to be done before I can move...where to begin? We should try to give each other incentives to achieve a certain amount each day! I wish I could come to your place and help you - I find cleaning other people's houses so much easier than cleaning mine! My boys have left a lot of their stuff here so I am just going to put it all in one room for them to sort out. Sue - 6 months already! That is the first of many milestones. Pretty soon it will be a year and then two years and beyond! I loved Mel's pic of the hand - how great to be able to count those tx down on one hand - still very hard for you but you are whittling them away.

I made a suggestion in one of my posts that it sounded a bit like a migraine but I think I deleted that part out because I didn't want to sound as though I was diagnosing! I have had occasional migraines over the years - the last one was just before my mastectomy last year. They are helllish! The first time I got one I thought I was dying! I had never had a headache before and suddenly, about 8 years ago they started severe nausea and a headache so bad it felt like an axe had been wedged in my skull. Once I threw up I would start to feel better but always felt exhausted afterwards. I found that strong pain killers that had a tranquiliser added stopped the nausea, dulled the pain and made me sleep it off. I have heard that some people's migraines can last for days - I shudder to think of having to put up with that for that long. I think you should have it checked out - the doc may be able to prescribe something helpful. On a lighter and happier note - that is just wonderful about Olivia's most recent work! She is becoming quite a star. Please pass on my congrats to her - she deserves it - and so do you! You are such a sweet and supportive mother. I will blow really hard and try to shift some of this heat over your way. I am way over it! I am fantasising about the little cottage and the cool, crisp air in the mountains! The contract is being checked by the lawyer so hopefully, it will all be signed and sealed soon. Mel - how lovely for you to be going to your mother's for Easter! I'll bet she is a gorgeous woman - just like her daughter. Easter really marks the beginning of spring for you northern hemispherites - eggs and chickens and new growth. I can really appreciate how you must long for the warmer weather after experiencing the restrictive aspects of the beautiful snow. It snows in the mountains on the Great Dividing Range but doesn't stay on the ground for more than a day or two usually. People love it here - such a novelty! I hope you can get some money back from that huge bill for the car! That's dreadful! Sue, please take a day or so off if you feel dreadfully tired when the steroids wear off. I am sure that rest must make the tx more effective. Also, please give dear Zippy a gentle pat for me and tell him I hope he is feeling better really soon.  Sheila - I don't know how you worked, studied and looked after your son! Wow - supermum! My nearest family lived 5 hours away so I found that I just couldn't work much outside the home. They did help me financially and when the boys went to their dad's for holidays, I would get cleaning jobs or blood courier work. I tried to finish my degree a couple of times when they were young but had to drop out each time. Finally finished it when the youngest one was in his final years of school.",

I have a friend who lives in France and they are either 8 or 9 hours behind us - depending on daylight saving time. So I guess England would be not too different. We lived in Southampton for nearly 6 months when my boys were young. The middle one started school there. I loved England - especially the countryside. It was like walking into an Enid Blyton book from my childhood! I do admire you Sue. You are such a fighter - that is why you say you are not a good patient! You have weathered this last month remarkably well  - worked full time, continued to care for and support your boys and created the most anguished, real descriptions of how you are feeling. I too think you should write a book when you get through this. Can I put my order in for a copy now?! hugs, gb ",

I borrowed an ipod from one of them and listened to JM's music all through my hospital stay because it reminded me of that great night at the concert. I particularly related to his song \"In Repair\" - I know he is talking about his heart but I related it to my wound! Stay strong Sue - grab the beast round its neck and spiflicate it!

I'm sorry you had a rough time in hospital but from the sound of it, you endeared yourself to them - just as you have with us. It's natural to feel sad and low a few days after surgery. It has been such a traumatic few weeks for you and you are probably feeling a bit in limbo again. For now, just rest and concentrate on mending yourself. Hang in there. You will always find support here and we will help you over the next 2 weeks and beyond. love & healing hugs, gb ",

I think it was a reaction to the drugs, surgery, the whole emotional roller coaster plus I had an infection in the SNB end of my wound.   Perhaps you might get some funny DVDs to watch over the weekend.

      "Content": "Nov 3, 2007 02:55PM - edited Nov 4, 2007 04:05AM by geebung Hi Sue, I am wondering if the dull ache in your neck, chest and wound is caused by a build up of lymph fluid. This is so common after surgery. Sometimes it pools in one place (seroma) and other times it can be over a large area. I still have it a bit in my scar but at its worst it was all over the front of my ribs, round to my back and especially in my arm pit where they removed the nodes. There were no obvious lumps, just a heavy, tender feeling. Lymphatic massage was SO relieving and soothing. Kinesio (sp?) taping brings great relief too as it lifts the skin slightly and the lymph can drain away. I hasten to add that if this is what is causing the ache, it doesn't mean you have lymphoedema but post surgical edema. It will eventually settle down but it can be uncomfortable. Perhaps you are working too hard - if you use the surgical side too much it can cause an increase in lymph.  It's so interesting about the vinegar cravings and extreme fatigue and great that you don't have them any more. You are doing so well Sue. I will be thinking of you especially over the next few days before the onc appointment. Great idea to jot down your questions - it's so hard to think of them when you are sitting in front of the dr. Well, I'm off to see Miriam Margolyes, a British actress (she was in at least one of the Harry Potter movies). She's doing a show called \"Dickens' (Charles) Women\". I saw her interviewed on tv and she is hilarious.  Enjoy your day off Sue. Hope you can do something indulgent and relaxing. Lots of love, gb ",

I am sorry you are feeling a bit sick but I hope the anti-nausea meds and steroids will keep the worst se's at bay. I am sure tea is a good alternative to water - after all it does have diuretic (spelling?) results so it should flush the toxins out.  How amazing that you found that article about Oz! It's a good omen! Karen, it's horrible that you and Sue and so many others have to go through this chemo thing but so great that you can give each other support and knowledge. It is very comforting to talk to people who are walking a similar path. Love and hugs, gb ",

Honestly, I think it is sometimes more difficult to cope with our loved ones' reactions to bootface than our own. You have had a terrible few days (as if you haven't had enough of those!). I too wish I could give you the statistics on Tamoxifen. All I can say (it was me with the 84% ER positive bootface although Melody might be the same) is that there must be so many variables that doctors consider when prescribing this medication. Family history, age, post or pre menapausal status, hormone status, grade and stage of bootface, etc etc. Mine was non-invasive and I had no family history so maybe that is why I am not on it (and I don't want to be on it!) but if I was told that I was high risk I would have to reconsider I guess.

Please don't ever feel that you are bringing anyone down. We have had some very down women here and we cry with them and wish we could be there in person to give them a hug. This is the second best thing - cyberhugs! I hope Karen's sunshine arrives soon for you. Suebee, you did your best to go out and party but the only thing that's going to make you feel better now is to get this over with. It's hard to escape from your worries when surgery is imminent. My thoughts and prayers are with you as Monday approaches. Mel, my brain is like a sieve sometimes - I forgot to comment on that lovely photo of your son and his girlfriend and the sweet Lilly! He is kind and so good looking and she is really pretty! Hope you had a great time with them. Jane xxx ",

My kids were plagued with middle ear infections when they were young and suffered so much pain. Outer ear infections can really hurt too - mine sometimes got them when they swam in public pools. Glad you were able to get your own meds so you can be ready for your implant surgery. When are you having it? I love knitting - I'm not very advanced but I find it so relaxing - did a lot last year when I was getting over my surgery. I wish I could crochet! I can do the basic chain but I haven't progressed! Karen, I know you said something about your new house just recently but my scatty brain can't remember. You are building I think? How long do you think it will be before you be able to move in? Judie - I'm sorry you are having sleep problems. I don't have any problems falling asleep but tend to wake up at 2 or 3 am with a hot flash and find I'm unable to go back to sleep. It's so frustrating and then I feel tired all day. The last couple of nights I have slept through though. I put that down to a fabulous MLD massage I had on Tuesday and all the laughter last night. I'm doing a mental health course. Last night we had to do some roll play. Some of my classmates are natural actors - they were so funny! Our teacher told us to try not to laugh so much and I nearly imploded trying to stifle my mirth. It was so much fun. I am so glad your in-laws are safe in China. There have been so many tragedies in Asia lately - it's heartbreaking watching the news. Ann - I don't understand why people wear the things they do! Last night was chilly and the younger people in my class were complaining of the cold - but they only had thin, cotton tops on! I had a cotton top, lightweight cardigan and a thick woolly jacket (that way, I can peel off for hot flashes!). Ulla - I'm so sorry to hear that you are feeling down and having worries about tamoxifen. However, your surgeon sounds wise and empathic. I hope you and she can work out a plan for your meds that mimimises side effects.  Melody, I am saying prayers for you, your husband and for the doctors who will operate on him. You must be exhausted after being at the hospital for so long. Love to everybody. Sorry I haven't mentioned all your names - am racing around this morning. Hugs, Jane xxx ",

It's great to have people here who are at different stages - first dx, having tx, finished tx and years  past treatment. Ituenge - please keep posting and let us know how things are with you and your next surgery. Erin - I know what you mean about wishing to have been here when first dx. I didn't even know such forums existed when I was dx last year and it was a very lonely time. I had family support but I didn't like to let them know all my fears... Sue - hope you have a wonderful, restful and happy Saturday. Yum! I feel like subway! I am on my own today so I might treat myself! Karen - I love the photo of Buddy - what a sweet, happy face!

      "Content": "Jun 4, 2008 06:25PM - edited Jun 4, 2008 06:28PM by geebung Karen, this is such a hard time for you and your parents. I am so sorry that you have to face such sadness and worry when you are still fragile from your own recent treatments and all the stress, exhaustion and worry that has caused. Please don't ever feel that you are a broken record. This is sad, unfair and just plain horrible for you all and you need as much support and love as possible at this time. Love to you sweet one. Ulla - I am no authority on tamoxifen but everyone is different as to how they react to medications. I find it very frustrating when people say that your  body \"should\" or \"shouldn't\" be reacting in a certain way...you are you and your metabolism is different to other women. From what I have heard and read, there are lots of different reactions to tamoxifen at the beginning of taking the medication and these usually settle down. I'm sorry this is upsetting you and giving you worry. Hope it is all sorted out soon. Ann, I hope you feel better soon. You probably need to cry some more and let it all out. I bet you have been bottling up your real feelings for such a long time and they need to be released. The Zoloft has been blocking things and has been useful in getting you through but perhaps it is good for you to have gone off it for a short time to let your emotions vent? Nancy - I love to hear of divorced couples who can forget their differences and forge a new friendship. If only people could do this for their kids, I'm sure divorce would lose a lot of its sting. My kids' father has so much resentment I cannot see him ever being able to speak to me and we have been divorced for 21 years! My sons are already hoping to elope if they get married so they don't have to have face the discomfort of having their parents at their weddings! I wish I could be friends with him...

Just the other day someone posted to say that she had coped brilliantly with her dx, surgery and treatments but now feels so sad and isolated. I kept my emotions well hidden most of the time through my dx & surgery but about a month later I was very sad and anxious. This faded to be replaced with a stunned sort of inactivity...each day just blending into the next - I seemed to be in slow motion, looking out of myself and not really feeling much - perhaps I had some sort of depression.

Kaloni - it was so great to hear from you and I am so glad you are feeling so much better since your last surgery.

Any advice on stripping my table and making it look good?  Sheila, I hope Penelope has recovered from the fireworks. My last dog (Thelma) was terrified of thunderstorms and fireworks. I used to keep her in on New Year's Eve and play cheerful and quite loud music in an attempt to drown out the noise and distract her. Yesterday my sister & I took \"Klaus\" to the vet to have his shots and to discuss de-sexing. The vet commented that he \"was far too pretty to be a male\" He had a feel around and said \"It's a girl!\" So I am thinking of maybe calling her \"Possum\" or \"Ntombi\" (Zulu for lady) or  \"Mineau\" or \"Minoo\"? (which I am told is French for meow!). It's funny because we were just discussing (the day before) that she did look feminine but I didn't want to upset her by having a really good look!) I had hoped to get a female cat but when \"Klaus\" came along and insisted that I adopt \"him\" I loved \"him\" straight away. So now I have my female cat and I'm very happy!  Love to everyone, Jane xxx ",

As somebody else said - age is irrelevant - it's things like kindness, sense of humour, interests in common that make a good relationship. My dh is 7 years older than I am and I know of some very successful relationships of differently aged partners. ((((Sue)))) - as Lisa said, you are an unstopable force! You have such spirit - in spite of feeling whacked from all that you do! No wonder you are feeling battered - most people in perfect health don't work as hard as you do - and you have the huge responsibility of your dear boys as well. ((((Ulla)))) - just want to send you a big hug and hope that you will have peace of mind soon. You must be so sick of all these tests and worries. Nancy - how are you feeling? Are you having any post surgery problems? Hope you are recovering well. Judie - so thrilled that you have moved and are feeling satisfied. It is a dilemma about Agnes. If only a family member could stay with her. Would it perhaps be safer (if you can't take her with you) to book her into a pet hotel/cattery/boarding place? At least you would know then that your sofas and curtains weren't being shredded. Kaloni - hooray - you mastered photobucket! Fumi - what can I say? Your story is amazing. Many people would have given up in your situation. You have fought such a good battle - and won. Big hugs to you. AE - Iove the photo of the sleeping kittens - dear little things! Hi to UB. I am feeling a bit dopey after having a lump cut off my tongue yesterday. I was a wimp and had sedation so I was unaware of the procedure but it was rather sore afterwards. Today it is swollen and I am avoiding talking and eating. (Hopefully I will lose weight!) Today I am having more cut out of my head where they removed the bcc a couple of weeks ago. Nothing serious - just slightly inconvenient.  Tomorrow it's back to the mountains as we have a sofa being delivered. I plan to move there within the next few weeks.  Lots of love to all of you, as well as Karen, Wren, Shirlann, Jule, Ann, Sheila, Melody and everyone. Jane xxx   ",

I also became a lifetime member so I really should go back for some inspiration. I think you are so kind and sweet to cuddle that poor puppy. I felt such a surge of anger when I read about his owner's treatment of him. So he was valuable to that horrible woman? What about his feelings? The poor little darling. Nancy - well done! What did you do? Did you exercise more or eat less - or both? Food is such a delight! I love good food - lots of leafy greens, kumara (orange sweet potato), legumes, fish, fruit, olive oil... I just need to eat less of them and exercise more. I probably need a bit more vanity too! Above all, I need to do it for my health - my blood pressure is high (runs in my family) and the pills my dr put me on recently haven't worked so I started on a new medication this morning - I so hope it works. I'm sick of health issues. Judie - what are you up to? I love to think of you living in your little apartment in a funky downtown area.

Karen, why on earth would they give your dad Haldol again, knowing how badly it effects him?! Poor man! And it must be so hard on your mother, you and the rest of the family. If you can find a good nursing home he would probably be looked after very well there. My mother is in a small, caring nursing home and I don't think she could be looked after better. It isn't the most glamorous place but it has wonderful, attentive staff. Your poor mother must be exhausted with looking after your dad (before he went to hospital) and the worry of all this must be wearing her down. I hope and pray you will find just the right place for him - not too far away from where you and your mum live so that visits won't mean a lot of travel time. Or, if it is a retirement home with a full range of care, perhaps your mom could live in the assisted living part and your dad could be in higher level care? Then they would be close to each other and she could see him whenever she wanted to. Please keep us posted and know that we love you & care about you. (((((Karen))))) Shirlann - wooooow!

My 3 sons are all in Indonesia too but they are having a lazy holiday in Bali. I pray that no terrorist attacks occur anywhere in the world this Christmas. I have a very close bond with my 3 and even though we won't be together at Christmas it makes me happy to know they are having a well-earned rest because they all work so hard. Sue, go to the top of the class for resting so well on your day off and a big gold star as well! You must rest more often!! Poppy - so glad your tooth is feeling better. Mommy Mia, I am thinking of you and so sorry you have had a bad time lately. I am back in Australia now and it feels strange to look out and not see snow and not to have to walk carefully so as not to slip over on the ice. I love Canada! I wish I could have crossed the border into the US as well but time and money didn't allow.  Shirlann - loved hearing about the first interaction between Cleo and your dog - they are sure to be friends. Karen, so glad you are feeling a little better. I want to comment on all your posts but I am still jet-lagged and incoherent! Lots and lots of love and hugs to all of you sweet, dear sisters. gb ",

Does he know what sort of spider it was that bit him? Anyway, probably doesn't matter - it sounds more like an infection than a poison reaction. Looking back over the years, all the accidents and medical dramas happened at weekends - especially long ones. Good luck & please let us know how he is. Sheila - your back issues when you were young sound like pure torture - you poor thing! Yet you turned the whole experience into something positive - the needlework, reading etc.  Cathi - I have to admit I had a bit of a (sympathetic) giggle when I read about your shower - and then the stove incident. Heck - it's probably the bimbo's negative energy impacting on you before she even arrives! She is sure to come out with some clangers again this visit. People like that don't seem to be able to self-censor what comes out of their mouths and seem to be oblivious of the hurt/embarrassment/annoyance they have caused.  Karen - enjoy the beautiful weather this weekend. I hate sharing computers! I'll look forward to hearing from you when the kids are back at school. Happy long weekend to all who are having one and I hope everyone else has some good times too. xxxx",

I can relate to how you are feeling about your upcoming surgery. When I was first dx last year I was more worried about having a general anaesthetic than the bc as I had never had surgery before. But just think of all the women who go through this operation every day. It will be so good for you to feel whole again. The great thing about recon is that it is a positive surgery - it gives you something back to replace what has been taken away. When I put it like that, I start to feel tempted to have it myself! Glad that Olivia is feeling better and the party was a success. You have a very busy life!  Melody, it's very understandable about your palpitations. I think we squash things down sometimes because we don't really want to confront them but they sometimes manifest themselves in physical symptoms. I think I get them too - wake up some nights with my heart pounding for no apparent reason. It's reassuring that your blood results were good. I love trains - especially steam engines. I went on on one in the mountains last year - they are wonderful things - they seem alive - sort of like friendly dragons - puffing and wheezing and working so hard to climb up the hills. Karen - great photos! What a lovely family shot! And the horses...I just love big draught horses with their huge shaggy feet. Big horses often have very gentle characters. I want to go to Leavenworth too! Sorry you had a few stresses between your dh & dd. I absolutely hate family discord. You want your family to be a haven of solace and when it's not, it's very upsetting. Sue - what a terrifying dream, no - nightmare! It's strange how just one little mention of something can resurface in your dreams. Hmmm, I could analyse that one for you...! I'm glad I didn't say anything about scarier creepy crawlies! Oh I so hope that you have a better time after this red devil. Talk about courage under fire, you amazing woman. Ulla - you are such a wonderful support to Sue - you say so many great, encouraging things - you inspire everyone. Wow - what a woman! Oh, but you are all fabulous!   Even though I am complaining about doing this course, (every day for 3 weeks) I am getting a bit of focus and direction. At the moment I am thinking of becoming a teachers' assistant - the pay is good but you don't have the same stress levels and responsibilities. Am also considering doing a short course to qualify me to teach literacy to adults or even English as a second language. Last year (thanks to bc) I lost all focus and confidence - I think I am starting to get it back now. Have to learn to believe in myself a bit more and do some positive self talk. Confidence is so important in this cut throat world... Love to all you precious sisters, including Sheila, Shirlann, Karyll, Mouse, Mia and everyone. Hugs to all  gb ",

Also, Sue - there are lymph nodes all over your body - the lymphatic system is a bit like the blood system. So there are a lot of nodes over your chest. The main lymph vessel (the one all the small ones drain into - can't remember its name now) is in the middle of your body, behind your sternum. So perhaps the pain is lymphatic? Who knows...I just think that the body must go into full-scale protest at having all this gunk pumped into it and it aches everywhere to try to get you to stop torturing it. In the long run it recovers and leaves the bootface as a smouldering heap of impotent ashes. gbxx ",

I used to work in a factory packing biscuits and I got a repetitive strain injury on the same side as I eventually got bc (just a coincidence). So how much more vulnerable you are doing repetitive work after bc surgery. You are such a trojan Sue - really, really valiant - but I do worry about your arm with all the repetitive work you do.

Your daughters are a huge credit to you and love you so much. You work such long hours and you have this worry about your surgery coming up - no wonder you are exhausted! I wish we could be all there to give you a huge hug. I know your daughters are young adults now and they will make it ok but it would give you so much pleasure to step in and help them out. They understand and love you. Their father is missing out big time on those precious girls. I know exactly how you feel about not being able to help your kids financially. I was on my own for 10 years before I remarried and I just could not give my boys any more than the basics - shelter, food and huge amounts of love. When they wanted their first computer, they had to go around the neighbourhood for months washing cars and doing odd jobs to save enough to buy a second hand one. How I would have loved to have gone out and bought them a brand new computer! I had to get child support to collect the maintenance because my ex was always late with the payments and I was reallly dependent on when I was in between cleaning jobs and factory work. The difference was that my ex was/is a very wealthy man but had the attitude that because I left him and took the boys away (he was having an affair and wouldn't give her up - wanted both of us (!) and eventually married her and they had twins) that he wasn't going to help us. He was furious when I contacted Child Support and had them take it out of his salary. Considering how much money he was making and all his stocks and shares, he should have paid a lot more! Just like in Melody's situation, as soon as each boy turned 18 the child support stopped and they had to put themselves through college. I could never help them much - just give emotional support but they love me and they always ring me where ever they are and ask my advice.  Sorry, I have raved on about myself - mainly to just show how common this is! There are some wonderful, unselfish men out there but man, there are some rats as well! I cannot understand why these men want to punish their children by behaving like this. If we as mothers, left our children behind to pursue our careers, other partners, whatever...would we forget our children and not bother to pay the most we could to help them? It makes me SO angry too. Even if I was prevented from ever seeing my kids again I would still want to support them financially because love can't be just switched off!  I hope you can have some time to rest over the weekend and come here and vent as much as you like! We love you. hugs, gb ",

It is scary and overwhelming to be told that you need a mastectomy and you need some time to come to terms with this. At this stage, it seems to me that you have non-invasive bc and that is the \"best\" type to have. I had ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) all through my left breast. I had a lumpectomy first but no clear margins so I had a mastectomy last April. There is usually no rush for surgery for DCIS because it hasn't invaded. However, until the final pathology comes back they can't rule out invasion. My surgeon was in a hurry to operate because the first path report suggested invasion. However, the path on my mastectomy showed no invasion so I didn't have to have chemo or rads. The big question that nobody can answer is which DCIS will spread? If only we knew! I was very eager to have my mastectomy because I didn't want to take any chances - I was told that, due to the aggressive character of my bc, that it could infiltrate at any time so I am grateful that they found it when they did. Now, about double mastectomies. One of my friends had this done and she is coping well. She also had quite big breasts but has decided against recon. She chooses to wear a double prosthesis.  It's a really individual thing. You could have a single mastectomy with a reduction on the other breast if you wanted to and then wear a prosthesis on the mastectomy side. Or you could have a bilateral mastectomy done and have a recon the size that you would like. There are quite a few options. For now though, you need lots of support and understanding ears. Don't feel rushed unless there is good reason to have surgery sooner rather that later. If you have worked in oncology, you no doubt know a lot more than I do so what I have said is probably not new to you. The most important thing for you now is to vent, yell and find support. You are very welcome here. Hugs, gb (Jane) ",

He wasn't impressed! He hates being jammed up against other people. I guess we will both work something out - we are both a lot more mellow now. It's sad about your kids' grandparents Lisa. Just before I found out (I had suspected it for months) about my first husband's affair/s) my mil had told me that she \"loved me like a daughter\". We had become quite close but when I left her son, he bent the truth somewhat - made out that I had left and then he had met the other woman because she was such a comfort and he was soooo lonely! Grrrrrr! Anyway, she believed him and took his side. My ex used to be so nasty about me to my boys when they had access visits with him. In spite of it all they have kept on seeing him - they crave his approval - which they rarely get! They know what he is like and all say that I am better off without him. They still love his mother who is basically quite sweet - just a bit one-eyed about her blue-eyed boy! I am going to have a whinge now - my arm feels as though it has a bag strapped under it this morning - lots of lymph build up. Damn! Maybe I overdid my workouts at Curves last week. No - it's probably that I haven't been massaging myself. I am big on telling everybody else here to massage themselves and go to LE specialists but I don't practice what I preach!

Most doctors will say that LE after a SNB is extremely unlikely but, my own experience shows that it is possible. Before my mastectomy and snb, the breast centre referred me to their resident physiotherapist who explained about lymphoedema, gave me exercises to do after surgery and said she would be seeing me 2 weeks after surgery to see how I was healing. After surgery (2 sentinel nodes removed), I had to have my wound drained several times after having my drains removed (they were removed on the 3rd day). I kept my appointment with the physio who gave me a gentle lymphatic massage. I saw her a couple of times after that for massages. After about 8 weeks, I was still feeling swollen and uncomfortable. At my bc support group, another physiotherapist was recommended so I went to her for ongoing therapy. She diagnosed me with mild lymphoedema (truncal and in my arm) and treated me with lymphatic drainage massage and kenesio taping. She also taught me how to do self massage and fitted me with a full sleeve.  I continued recieving LE treatment for nearly a year after surgery and the LE gradually diminished. I no longer wear my sleeve and life has returned pretty much to normal. I think that early intervention and the therapy I received were invaluable to me. I leaned a lot about the condition and I feel sure that the therapy prevented the LE from becoming more severe. I don't wear an LE alert bracelet but I think it's a great idea.  So, if you can find a good LE therapist, I would recommend making an appointment, getting base line measurements of your arm and learning as much as you can about the condition and prevention.",

No harm in a bit of match making - I think friends and family can often see possibilities and these often work out. Sue, your busy and stressful day sounds exhausting. I am sure you are a very good boss and it sounds as though you have some very difficult situations to deal with. You had every right to yell!

You can't choose the pub over work if want to keep your job! Ulla - interesting article but not sure if I agree with it! No doubt there are many things in our environment that cause bootface - it's probably not one but many factors and it's very difficult to avoid all these toxins. I don't like it when they talk about personality types getting cancer or attitudes because it puts the blame right back on the patient. Of course we all have a responsibility to live as healthfully as possible but I know several people (myself included) who have had good diets, exercised and had positive attitudes  and yet we still got it! I constantly see articles on studies that suggest that certain lifestyles, foods, etc cause bootface and they do probably all contribute...one of the latest causes was shiftwork - well, I worked nightshift for 2 years but a lot of other people I worked with are still fine so...who knows?

I'm glad you are having long naps as well as doing all your dynamo stuff. You are fabulous! Nancy - I'm with you regarding housework! There are so many more interesting things to do. My problem is being inconsistent - I tend to let days go by without doing much and then I have a cleaning frenzy. Like yesterday! I attacked the house, vacumming, mopping, scrubbing and it felt SO good afterwards! (Except for my aching back!) The time before that, I cleaned without my compression sleeve and that was not a good idea but my arm is great today, after wearing the sleeve during the cleaning. Shirlann - I know what you mean about wanting a daughter. I would have liked one too but as soon as each son was born I was crazy about him. I wonder if I will get along with any future dils? I guess if girls are really close to their own mothers, they might feel that they don't really need mils... I am very impressed with your handling of your sons' driving - wow! What an incentive to behave themselves when behind the wheel! My eldest son was in a bad car accident a few years ago and walked away with only 3 cracked ribs. I will never forget the 2am phonecall with a voice saying \"It's the hospital here and your son was just admitted...\" Surprisingly, I was quite calm...until the next day when I saw his car - it looked like a boomerang! He was so lucky. Boys tend to be a lot more reckless than girls.  Love to everyone! You know who you are!  xxxx ",

My ex was so antagonistic towards me that I think she was afraid to have contact with me. I wrote to her once and she did write back to me, chiding me for leaving her son!

Food poisoning from her lunch at the restaurant? We will see... Oh Sue - so good to see you! I did laugh when I saw your pic of the long suffering mother dog with all those pups! So cute! I love the way she looks resigned to her role - she's quite chilled out! Must be all the oxytocin (sp?) hormone in her body! I also laughed over your ditching the wig - that poor old lady probably thought she was going crazy!! I bet you do look pretty without it - with your sweet face. Then I got mad when I read how your boss thinks you are shirking! How DARE he!!! Oooooh I wish he was in a room with all of us - we would give him a good tongue lashing!

Poetry is important! I hope you are still writing poetry - it's so theraputic when you are feeling sad, bad, in love, desperate, happy...etc. There is nothing like getting it all out there on the page. I understand how personal it is. I wrote lots of poetry as a teenager. Years later, my first husband found my poems and read them. He wrote a few comments beside them (mocking ones) so I took my folder of poems outside and burnt them all. I wish I hadn't now...

I totally agree with Shirlann - he doesn't mean to be like this. Depression just takes over. My mother has been depressed for years but refused to take anything for it. (What good that did her or those around her?) When she was looking after her second husband (my dad died when I was 25 (he was 74) he became increasingly self-focussed and unconsciously selfish even though he was a sweet old man. My sister and I were angry too so I think I can understand how you feel. The whole situation is unfair, sad and stressful for everyone involved. I will keep you all in my prayers. I love the new house! It's still pretty big. When will building begin? Life is full of light and shade isn't it? Just as well we have some sunny bits! ((((Dawn)))), would it do any good to insist that your brothers do a little more to help? Sometimes men just don't get it and things need to be spelled out clearly to them! I forget if you are having a mammogram or lumpectomy - with or without recon? I cannot give any suggestions for a recon because I haven't had it. I think I had a pretty easy time after my surgery. I had a seroma with the lumpectomy which resolved itself and after the mx, I had a lot of fluid buildup and an infection but apart from that there wasn't a lot of pain. I was rather weak though for the first week or so afterwards and a bit weepy once or twice. Love to everyone Jane xxx ",

Shirlann - What a great milestone - 55 years! That's an emerald one! You are a wonderful couple. I saw Niagara Falls in the winter last year on the Canadian side and they were scarily beautiful. Huge icicles were hanging off the cliffs - quite an amazing sight.  Melody - I am sure the dr thinks you are very low risk - if he/she were worried, you would have been rushed through. If you are worried you could ask to be placed on a cancelation list. That's what I did and I had mine sooner. Lisa - how was lunch???!!  Love to all you dear sweet ones, Jane xxx ",

I am so sorry everything is so hard for you and I hope and pray that you will soon have some relief from so much worry and heartache. Ann, it's so great that you were able to meet up with Sheila and also spend time with your family and friends. I'm glad that the heat wave has passed. Autumn is best time of the year I think - really energising! Shirlann - When I went to Canada at the end of last year my sister & I stayed with my niece and her husband in Burlington, Ontario. I think it was about an hours drive north of Niagara Falls. Winter is probably not when most people would want to visit but I am really glad I saw it then. There were no crowds and the scenery was so dramatic and beautiful. Anyway, my sister was there for her daughter's wedding on the 1st October the year before last and she said it was just wonderful then. My niece and all the guests wore summer clothes. I know it can get cold quickly at that time of the year and I would think that the nights might be a bit chilly. The autumn colours will be gorgeous! I went to Scotland in October and it was perfect weather so I think it's a great time to travel in the northern hemisphere. Sheila - my dog (who is no longer with us) used to love shredding tissues. She knew I didn't like her doing it and she would look so guilty when I came around a corner and caught her in the act! Sue - people in the UK thought we were nuts when we said we were driving to Scotland for a long weekend! We drove from Southampton to the Lakes District on the first day, then to Loch Ness the next, then to James Herriot country (can't remember what it's called) and back to Southampton - with the 3 kids - the youngest was about 19 months. It's a 12 hour trip to Brisbane from where I live. My son drove to Brisbane and back with his mates in one day to buy a drum kit. Now that's a bit ridiculous!  Nancy - I will celebrate for your last chemo this Friday! Karen, I hope you were able to sleep after your dad's funeral. You must be exhausted. Thinking of you. xx Hugs and lots of love to everyone, Jane xxx ",

We went to an Indian restaurant and then to have coffee on the harbour. Finally got to bed at about 1 am and when I have a late night I don't sleep well (overstimulation?) and then I wake up early so I was a wreck on Sunday. Then Will (my youngest son) and his girlfriend got it into their heads that they needed a pet. They decided to get a baby chick each. I tried to point out that little chicks need to be kept warm, they need a cage that can be moved around the yard so they can eat fresh grass and that they are prone to illnesses and you can't be sure they are females and what would they do with a couple of roosters who are prone to crowing at all hours of the night? It did no good - they were so set on the idea. So off we went to the pet shop and they chose 2 of the most feminine looking chicks. They are silkie bantams - very cute. Will said he will build them a cage at school (he's a teacher). They've called them Tonx & Bronx. I hope they survive!",

I was only away from here for a couple of days and so much to catch up on. Sue, so glad you are feeling a bit better and thrilled that you have a week off very soon. I hope you can forget about work for all of that time and just do feel-good things and rest - and talk to us of course!!  AE - am thinking of you. I am just so angry that you have to have another biopsy, with all you and your dear man are going through - it's so unfair! I hope so much that they will just find benign calcs and that will be the end of that. I loved hearing about your dear dog stopping by you for a big kiss on the nose! Shirlann - so happy that Walt's test came back ok and that you can still go on your trip. Hope your soreness from the fall gets better soon but so glad you didn't break anything. Lisa - that is fantastic about your daughter doing the commercial! And with a hunky sportsman too! How excited she must be! Please pass on my congratulations and I hope she is \"discovered\" by an even bigger advertising company! Wish I could see the ad. Your bone scan sounds as though it will be ok - the techs know an awful lot. When I had a colonoscopy done last year, a nurse let me know everything was ok by some subtle comments!  Hi Mia! Hope you are doing ok. You must be so sick of the snow by now. I loved it when I was in Burlington because it was such a novelty but I am sure you will be happy to see the last of it in the springtime. It must be so beautiful there then. My sister is back in Burlington now, staying with her daughter, waiting for the baby to be born. She was due on the 18th Feb so she's now almost 2 weeks overdue! The baby is small and they are keeping a careful eye her and my niece. Lucy - atagirl! Wow - it all sounds so intense and romantic - just what you needed! I think we need to see some pics soon! Well, I had a very busy week. Eldest son came back from Cambodia, I started my mental health course (great bunch of people - really diverse, fun and friendly) and yesterday my dh and I went up to the mountains again to look at more houses. My favourite is still the first one we looked at but we did see 2 more that are worth considering. It was delightfully cool up there and we had to rug up - we both love the crisp, clear mountain air and the beautiful gardens and trees. I would love to live there.  I think my LE is improving - the swelling seems to be decreasing. I was a bit upset when my wrist got all lumpy about 10 days ago but I think that wearing my compression sleeve 24/7 and massaging it am & pm has helped a lot. I loved all your funny sentences from that game - my vague brain can't remember who started it - was it you, Sheila? The sniffing one was funny! Love to you all - including Mel, Tender, Dawn, Angie, Karen, Melody, Ulla, Vasul, Karyll, Wren and the new girls who posted here - can't remember your names but if I scroll back to look I might lose my post - great to see your comments.  Time for bed! Hugs, Jane xxxx ",

When you are all on here chatting it's morning here and I am racing around trying to get organised (?) and don't get the time to say much. Sheila - it must have been so great to hear your son's voice. It will be wonderful for you to see each other again. Sue - Lol! I did laugh over your hair-raising prank with those boys! I love your fantastic sense of humour! It will be so good for you to have a week off and just chill out - I hope you can forget work and the pinpricked Tom and really relax. Lisa - I have noticed that you are not yourself lately and I wish I could give you a big hug. I think that the emotional side effects of surgery are, in many ways, worse than the physical ones. It took me a while to feel ok again. Each one of us reacts in similar and different ways to these things. You know that you can come on here any time and say exactly how you feel and you will be understood and accepted. Melody - I hope your car is fixed soon. What a giant nuisance it is when they break down. Love the pic! I think our petrol costs twice as much as it does in the US and it's even more expensive in UK & Europe. My car has a lot of mileage and every time I drive it, I wonder it it will get me there! I catch trains when I can, to minimise its wear and tear and to save on running costs. Karen - in case you didn't get my birthday wishes on the other thread - Happy birthday for Saturday! Love to everyone. xxxxxx ",

I believe in nurturing yourself when you have negative feelings.  Have you ever read any of SARK's books or visited her website? I've always found her writings very encouraging and uplifting. She makes you feel good about yourself and that in itself is motivating. I'm praying that things will get easier for you and that you will have some small triumphs. Are you sure you don't have LE in your arm? I hope you can get some beneficial treatment for it soon. Sue - I know you are extremely frustrated at having to lie around.

Ed sounds like my husband - he can eat anything and stays thin whereas if I want to fit into my clothes I have to be so strict. I've fallen off the diet wagon a bit this Christmas with the fridge and cupboards crammed with foods I usually just do not have in the house. Sweet, sweet Ella - I can imagine how wonderful she smells. Oh, I would love a grandchild to cuddle and love. It sounds as though most of you had a great Christmas. We didn't give many gifts but most of my favourite people were all here together and that was the best part.  Nancy, it's sad that you have to sell your family house but of course you have to do what is best for everyone in your family. So glad you could get together with your siblings. Lisa - how lovely that you were with your daughters and everything went well. You mentioned a great new man...are we going to hear any more?!

The house we will be moving to has a fairly small yard and a lovely garden. I wonder what sort of dog I could get? I love medium to large dogs but will probably have to settle for a smaller, quieter breed. I do love going for walks with a dog so I would make sure we both got plenty of exercise. One of the houses we looked at had a gorgeous, elderly Golden Retriever. She was so gentle and I spent more time cuddling and playing with her than I did looking at the house. She was in a very small yard but I suppose old dogs don't run around as much and aren't so energetic. She became quite animated and grabbed her tail in her mouth and stared going in circles! Please give Penelope a hug from me! Jane xxx ",

I went to bed early because I was sooo tired from my busy week but then I woke up not long after 2am, lay awake until 3 and then decided I would get up and get on here. It's now nearly 4.30 so I will probably go back to bed soon and try to get some more sleep! Nancy - good luck with your battle with your insurance company. It really stinks that you have to go through this at a time like this. I so hope you get some satisfaction from them soon. So great to hear from you Lucy! You must be so busy - I know how flat out I used to be with my 3 sons. It's lovely that you have your gorgeous man to bring some joy into your life. Glad your son's rash doesn't seem to be upsetting him. It's funny how kids get unexplained rashes - I can remember my kids having them. AE & UB - hope you are doing ok. I guess the s/es from the treatment will be kicking in. Will pray that they are not too nasty. That Delbert - just love hearing about that dog!  Jule - your job sounds great! Hope you get some warmer weather soon - being wet and cold all day doesn't sound so good but it must be great to get out and about and have all that variety. Hi Karen, Lisa, Sue - I am worried about your lack of sleep - I so hope that your first day back at work was not too dreadful and that you can come home and rest. Bbl. Love to everyone. I think I will crawl back into bed now and try to get some zzzzs. Jane xxx ",

I'm so glad to hear that the new pain med is working well for you. I hope you get some warm weather soon. Also, hoping that the appointment for Landon goes well and that he is not too scared. Poor little guy. I had those absence seizures when I was a kid. My brother used to pick me up while I was having one and run with me to another room or area. When it was over (only a matter of seconds or minutes I think) I would be very confused as to how I got to where I was because I had no awareness during the seizure. My mother thought I was just a bit dreamy and it wasn't until a friend with medical training suggested that she take me to a specialist that she made an appointment for me. I had an ECG and was dx. I grew out of it by the time puberty started. Sheila, I hope your experience and dedication in your job brings you something better. Also, I'm sorry to hear about your concerns re your cervix. I do know several people who have had abnormal pap tests and most were just inflammation.  I hope you get your path report soon and you will know just what you are dealing with. I think I will try to go back to sleep now. Love to everyone here. Jane xoxoxox",

Nancy - I loved your story of your son's makeup artistry - what a talented boy! Did he end up in an artistic career? You write so well and I get such clear mental pictures of what you are talking about. I did laugh when I 'saw' you come through the door with your son stretched out playing dead! Lol!  Sheila - loved hearing about Penelope's shedding! She must adore all the extra brushing and attention! Your house must be so clean with all that vacuuming! My dear old dog used to shed all year round - and she was a shorthaired type. Lisa, I know what you mean about downsizing. I have a very big yard and I just can't keep up with it. When any of my sons are around they mow and do what they can but mostly it's just me here. (My dh is usually only here on weekends and we prefer to spend quality time together rather than working in the yard). We are both looking forward to the small and pretty garden in the mountains which will be much more manageable. I will enjoy doing some gardening there but all the hard work has been done with terraced garden beds and only small areas of lawn. Of course, the main problem will be lack of storage but that will force me to throw out a lot of junk and have a minimalist look! Wren! That is so exciting about your replacement surgery! A beautiful new you and an end to the discomfort of the fills... my best wishes for a great outcome. Oh, and welcome to whatsup - tell us your stories too! I do love reading about the lives of all the diverse and wonderful people here. Well, must get my head out of cyberspace and into some nitty gritty - the dust is calling for the vacuum cleaner and my assignments need attention - not to mention the washing up!

Firstly, Ulla - you look fantastic! Imagine how long your hair will be by summer! It's so good to see you back her posting. I know that, when I feel tired, it's hard to post so how much harder it must be for those of you having treatments. Nancy - you look lovely too - gorgeous face! And the wig looks so natural! I think it's a great idea to have a lazy day once a week and stay in your pjs. I enjoyed reading what you said about Mel's dream. Jule - a border collie!!! I LOVE them! If I was moving to a house with a big yard, that would be one of the breeds I would consider getting. I also love labradors, golden retrievers, cattle dogs, kelpies...the list goes on and on. But border collies have the sweetest dispositions and are wonderful with children. You know how they say that owners sometimes resemble their dogs? Well, I used to have an overweight Australian cattle dog (!) so next time I think I will get a whippet so that I can model myself on her and lose weight! Sue - I hope you can have a restful Sunday and sleep as much as you can. We know you are there reading our posts and that you will pop in occasionally to touch base but sleep and rest as much as you can - your body needs it to heal and get ready for your final treatments. Hi and welcome to Prycylla - some great advice there! Sheila - you must be so proud of your son. Congratulations on his success in passing that test! Mel - I can relate to your dream. I have had several about my post mastectomy body. It's not as though I think about it much in every day life but it comes up in my dreams - usually involves being naked and exposed in a public place!!! I think it's just part of the healing/coming-to-terms-with- everything journey and, whether we have recon or not, we are still aware that our bodies and mindsets have changed...  AE - please give my love and best wishes to UB. I hope the s/es improve soon. Hope you are both having a restful weekend with some happy moments. Shirlann - I can imagine you on the Amazon. Are there crocodiles? Can't wait to see some pics. Hugs to all I have mentioned here and all that I haven't. I really should get up and go for a walk. Now, if I had a dog I would be really inspired to get moving! Love to all Jane xxxx ",

A combination of screening methods is good because each one has strengths that the others lack and so a clearer overall 'picture' is obtained. If you are still concerned, a biopsy followed my microscopic assessment of the tissue sample is the most reliable diagnostic method of all. Go with your gut feeling and pursue this until you are satisfied. I hope and pray that the result will be convincingly benign.  Jane",

Leesa, what a hard time you have had and continue to have with your daughter and her husband. You are doing a wonderful job with your grandchildren, just like Cathi is. I think the advice and love and support here is so wonderful. Bless you all. Sue, it's so good to see you post again. I'm sorry that your test was positive. You have a lot ahead of you. Everyone here loves and supports you. I'm glad there is an online support group for BRCA women - you are sure to get good information and support there too. Sheila, I'm hoping and praying you get the job that is right for you soon. Judie - love the t-shirt! Nettie - I'm so sorry to hear of your loss.  Your last H treatment - what mixed emotions that must bring.  Karen, I hope you can fully move into your house soon.There is such a lot to do and you must be so sick of not being in one place! It's late and I'm yawning. Off to bed. Lots of love to everyone, Jane oxox",

For those who hate Christmas or who are sad, alone or disillusioned, it will pass! If you find it easy to be happy at this time of the year, that's wonderful but for many, it's one of the loneliest and most stress-filled times of the year. I used to find it sad when my kids were younger because they used to go to their father each Christmas and it was hard to see all the happy, intact families. I'll be spending the day with my husband and his family in Sydney. He has to work until lunch time and then he has a few days off after that so we'll have some time together. My sons are scattered around this year. The youngest is in Salt Lake City with his gf, enjoying a white Christmas and the other two are with their father & step-mother. We were all together last year so it's their Dad's turn this time. I'll catch up with them next week.  Anyway, love and peace to everyone here. Jane oxoxox",

It is sad to lose your breast - I too imagined mine, sitting alone in a lab jar somewhere...but it was no longer my friend. Of course you are feeling sad - who wouldn't? You have had weeks of stress and anguish, pain and worry. You have done so well, keeping your sense of humour and reaching out to others - you are a very precious member of this community. So many women have \"snowstorm\" breasts, flecked with calcifications, cysts and various tissues that show up as shadows and white things. Please don't think that every white dot and flash that you saw is sinister. I just read that 70% of bc begins in the ducts, 10% in the lobules and the remainder in other breast tissue. A general asaesthetic takes a while to recover from. The flashy pains are most probably caused by stress and lack of sleep.  We are all holding you very close - imagine a huge group hug that goes all around the world - all of your sisters with interlinking arms - we love and care for you. love, gb ",

Why, oh why are these organisations which are supposed to be protecting and advocating for children so ineffective?! For little children (babies really - they are both so young) to constantly witness their parents' detestable behaviour is ABUSE! You are well aware of this of course and it is breaking your heart. I just ache for all of you. What makes me furious is that children are seen as their parents' possessions and the parents' right to have them under the same roof appears to be far more important than the rights of the children to have a reasonably safe and secure life. I realise that, in the past, children were taken from the parental home and farmed out to institutional care and often abused by these institutions and of course that was wrong. But now, the pendulum has swung to the extreme opposite and everything is done to keep the kids in the family home with parents who couldn't even raise a kitten successfully - let alone human children. Where's the balance? Where's the common sense? I'm so angry and sad for your whole family. You and Ed have bent over backwards trying to do the right thing and yet these poor kids are still being damaged by their infantile parents. I'm just lost for words.  Hugs, Jane oxoxoxo",

I have always loved time on my own and my partner (who I married 11 years ago, then divorced after 5 years then got back with 4 years ago - so complicated!) and I usually only spend weekends together. He has just left my place as he had one weeks holiday. When we are together it's great but I don't mind being on my own either. I sleep a lot better! He likes to go to bed at 11 or 12 and he snores! Even if I go to bed at midnight I still wake up early and I don't think I sleep as well during the night because I am so used to sleeping on my own! And I have to admit that he is a noisy eater, he slurps his tea and chews noisily but because I don't have to put up with it all the time it doesn't really bother me. This \"part-time marriage\" type of arrangement suits me perfectly! I have a friend who married a French guy about 10 years ago and she lives in Paris with him. She comes back to Australia for about 3 months of each year and she always says that she wishes she could have a part-time marriage even though she loves him. I think we are all very normal. Every woman I know enjoys time aware from her dh - even when they are crazy about them! And most of the men I know like to get away and go camping or doing \"boy-type-things\" too. I think it's healthy! When I was single (between marriages for about 10 years) I admit I did get lonely from time to time but the kids kept me busy and I had friends and lots of interests.

      "Content": "Feb 4, 2008 12:31PM - edited Feb 4, 2008 03:25PM by geebung ((((((((((Valsul))))))))))! How wonderful to hear from you! Sending you many good thoughts and praying that your chemo will be highly effective. I hope you will come back from time to time and let us know how you are. I have missed you and I wish you would come back! Lisa, I know you won't be reading this just yet but I hope you could feel the warm vibes radiating towards you from south of the equator! I have been thinking of you such a lot and trying to work out the time difference and when your surgery would be. My son rang me from San Diego about an hour ago and it was about 11am Monday there so I guess it is all happening right now. Sending many gentle hugs and praying that you wake up feeling not too sore and very happy with the results.  Karen, I am thinking of you too and praying that you don't have to wait too much longer before getting your test results - and, most importantly, that they are good. I have heard so many women on chemo talk about the state of their nails. Many hugs to you too. Ulla, you are amazing to be exercising so vigorously already! Please don't overdo it! You are quite inspiring. I am so happy that you are feeling better and I am sure you will lose this weight - wow! What a woman! Sue, I hope the whole Adam thing wasn't too traumatic. He has been a silly boy and surely must realise that you have no choice but to let him go. Can you ring your doctor/onc and ask about the results of the scan? Surely, all tests would be sent to your onc? I suppose you are so busy at work and when you get home you just want to flop down and have a cuppa. Many hugs and good wishes for a good result. And you are still young enough to lose that weight easily when the time is right. Besides, I am sure you are being too hard on yourself - I bet you don't look overweight, you gorgeous girl! Sheila - I too am overweight. I used to be very skinny in my twenties and early 30s. Then the weight crept up very gradually. I dieted and lost it all but it gradually came back on. The last year has been the worst. On the morning of my mastectomy I got up and went for a long power walk and felt so fit and healthy. After that, I have found it difficult to walk with the same vigour. My arm tends to ache if I walk like that now. So I have been going to Curves 3 to 5 times a week. But I am still not losing weight! I eat healthy - lots of veg and fruit, try to limit the carbs etc. It's so frustrating and I would love to drop a dress size. Maybe when the cooler weather starts I will have more energy.  Great, encouraging words from Erika for those of you with chemo-kilos. Don't try to rush the weight loss. Perhaps your body needs it for a while to help with healing. I should imagine that the most important thing at this stage, for those of you who have finished chemo, is to eat as healthy as possible and do some exercise but not too much!  Lucy, even if you are a few kilos overweight, I am sure you still look gorgeous! I remember you saying last week that one of your customers was giving you the eye! I think breast surgery mucks your hormones up and makes it very difficult to lose weight for a while. You are still very young so I am sure the weight will come off fairly easily. You are still healing so don't be hard on yourself! Shirlann - I hope you and Walt are doing ok. Please, if you have a moment, let us know how you are both doing. Praying that this is something that can be fixed soon. You are always so loving and encouraging so I am sure your husband is getting lots of support from you. We are here to support you and we care deeply for you. xxx Karyll - still thinking of you and praying that you are ok. Pleeeeeease just say something or get someone else to post...xxxx  Auntie Em - you are such a treasure - thank you for your encouraging words and warm presence here!  Love to everyone - Wren, Melody, Mia, Dawn, Tender, Pearl, Barbie, Angie, Cyndy and Mamhop and anyone else I have missed. Jane. xxxx  Hi to everyone else! Wren, ",

Sometimes it seems that the right people meet but the timing is wrong or they aren't as well suited as they appear. We so want our children to be happy don't we? I think mine are wary of marriage and are leaving it much later than their parents did to settle down. Well, if that helps them mature and make wiser decisions, it's a good thing. I just fell into marriage the first time without a mature thought in my head!  Karen, I think you will make a great nurse! Your maturity and life experience will give you so much empathy and understanding. Lucky patients of the future! I am soooo tired today. I just want to curl up in my bed and sleep.

I wonder how you are feeling. I should imagine that you are feeling quite a high level of discomfort at the moment but it will be worth it in the long term. AE - love the photos of the cats! Makes me want a cat or a dog. Yesterday, one of the new kittens from next door was on my front verandah and welcomed me when I walked outside. Such a little scrap of a thing but he stood up on his hind legs to meet my hand as I went to stroke him and was rumbling with his kitten-sized purr. I felt like stealing him! Lucy, it's such a sweet photo of your son on the beach. I lived on the beach for a while when my kids were small and we spent so much time there, collecting shells and building sandcastles in the winter and swimming in the summer. Hugs to everyone here.

I made a false accusation against a long standing member and I feel terrible. From now on I will check my facts before shooting my mouth off. Sue, if you still feel exhausted tomorrow, could you possibly take the day off from work? It sounds as though they value you so highly there and I am sure they would prefer you to take it easy rather than working. So many people say that the first round of chemo is the worst because they don't know exactly how your body will react. Hopefully, next time they will make adjustments and you won't have such a rough time. hugs, gb ",

As Sheila said, it really is a personal decision. I was pretty sure I wanted it before my mastectomy but I am very reluctant to upset any more lymph glands! My physio told me yesterday that my LE varies between a stage 1 and stage 0 so I would like to keep it under control. I know women do have it done with LE and it is successful but as for me, I think I would rather remain uneven and keep LE at bay rather than risk it flaring up and getting worse. xx ",

But I love all vegetables and sardines and salmon. I used to hate brussel sprouts (the way my mother used to boil them until they were bitter!) but now I saute them in a little water and butter and lots of garlic and cracked black pepper - yum! And I always buy small ones - I think they are younger and they aren't bitter. Sue, another name for eggplant is aubergine - perhaps you know it by that name. It is another veg that needs to be prepared properly - the younger the better - good grilled (broiled), brushed with a bit of olive oil. You can also make a great dip out of it - baba ghanouj - really yummy! Jane xxx ",

Incredible! My sister is staying with her daughter in Ontario and she said it is the worst snow storm in history! Would that be right? She said that after the snow ploughs had cleared the roads, they went for a drive to look at Lake Ontario and there were huge, angry waves crashing on the shore - now I know why they have a surf club there!! Surely the surfers wouldn't tackle the waves in a blizzard! Lisa - your daughter is gorgeous - just like her sweet mother! And I know it isn't just outer beauty - she sounds like a lovely girl. I wish you could put the ad on YouTube so we could all see it! Sue, I am glad you have this week off but I am worried that you have too much time to think and worry. I am thinking of you such a lot and hoping they give you a lower dose of chemo or something to counteract the s/es - remind them how sick you were last time. Or was that mainly caused by the shingles? I pray you will come through this treatment better than the last one.   My dh put in his final offer on the little house in the mountains and it was accepted by the vendor! Now, if it passes the building and pest inspections, it will all go ahead! I am fairly sure it will pass those - it's an old house but has been beautifully restored and the garden is so pretty. It is late and I must go to bed. Hope to catch up with you all in (my) morning - tomorrow. Love to all  Jane xxx ",

We get a few frosts as we are a little inland from the sea (about 25 minutes away from the nearest beach) but the days tend to be sunny and mild - the lowest daytime temperatures of the year tend to be around 23-24 degrees F but usually a bit warmer than that. People who have lived here for a long time complain but I lived in Canberrra for a while and the winters were much longer and colder there. I am looking forwards to a Blue Mountains winter where it usually snows at least once each winter. Sue, I so hope you can get some sleep - roll on Sunday!

Interesting about making contact with your old Brownie leader. I wasn't a Brownie as a child - we mostly lived in isolated country areas so I had to amuse myself. My boys were all in youth clubs for a while and enjoyed going hiking and camping and some community work.

My son has been asked to do the photography for two weddings in August and September in California and Montana and he wants to know if that will be holiday time or not. Am I right in thinking the vacation is for 3 months? I remember my kids started school in England in early September... Love to everybody, Jane xxxxxx ",

Lisa - have a great time with your daughters - hope you have great weather and lots of fun. Welcome back Shirlann! Your trip sounds amazing and exciting. (((((Ulla))))) - path reports always seem to make things sound the worst. I would listen to your onc and to Karen, who has a friend who is still fit and healthy 7 years later. You are going to beat this! I was so impressed when I read about your long walk - you are doing so well to have that much energy! Judie - that is such a sweet picture of your cat - I wish I could give her a cuddle! Sue - your Sunday will be starting soon - I love to think of you at home with your dear boys. Hope you have a great day and that you can get some rest and beat off that sore throat. I will be thinking of you when you meet with your new boss.  Sheila - it would be great if you could remind us about the calendar. I wonder if an Australian cheque would be acceptable or would I have to go to a bank and do a special US one? I will find out. So great to hear that your son is coming home to see you! I can just imagine the joyful reunion. Our children, even if they are adults, living independent lives, far away, are always on our minds.  Love to all of you. Jane xxx ",

I would love to go there! And your babysitting day sounds like fun. What a lucky little possum Connor is to have such a lovely granny! I really like the cake idea too. So much fun. I can remember laboriously trying to make tains, numerical shapes etc for my kids' bd cakes but the landscape one sounds so adaptable - and yummy! Sweet Sue - are you still going to hospital on Tuesday? If so, are you having Monday off work? Perhaps, because of the green gunk, your doctor will realise it is just an infection and just give you antibiotics? They may still want to drain the area and clean it up a bit so I am thinking you will still be going to hospital. Woohoo - a new mobile, new laptop and a new coat! How wonderful! Sounds like you had a good birthday! Wren - I am silly...I did realise that you write the date the other way over there but I must have misread it. My middle son turns 27 on the !0th September. I think it's a great time of year to have a birthday no matter which hemisphere you celebrate it in! I will remember yours on the 23rd. Oh, and the job sounds great - I'm sure you will be so good at it. Must go and do some painting. Love to all of you, J xxx ",

Sue, everyone has given you great feedback about your current worries. It is so understandable that you are fearful and fragile. Your body is taking such a battering as these powerful meds fight that bootface. The lumps on your scar? Could these possibly be undisolved stitches? Sometimes they don't disolve and rise to the surface, forming small lumps. When it happened to me a got a fright. Lisa - your new haircut sounds fantastic - I am so excited for you! Valerie - what an amazing, huge dog - maybe not a lap dancer but certainly a lap squasher! Lol! Ulla, as always - so good to hear from you. You are so great! Karen - I was SO thrilled to hear that your most recent treatment has been so much better. Would love to write more but my body clock says its 1.15pm Saturday but it's 9.15 Friday night here! I love this cold cold weather! It's so magical and invigorating. The snow flurries - wow - so beautiful! Last night we stopped to get fuel on the way home to my niece's and I just had to get out and run out into it and my hair and shoulders were white with snowflakes! Sorry to rave but to an Aussie who rarely sees snow it is sheer magic! Much love all of you, gb xxxxx",

I think you are fabulous to work so hard. Just reading your post made me think how much your English has improved since you first started to post here. However, everything about this test seems unfair. You should have been given more notice to give you time to prepare, they should have provided a more relaxing environment and you should not have to wait so long to do the test again. Not knowing how you did is so stressful. I wonder how long they will keep you waiting for the result? I agree with you - it would be better to know that you had definitely failed than to be kept waiting for who knows how long. I hate the sound of high heels tapping - especially when you are trying to concentrate - grrrrrr! I hope your husband can be with you soon. I wish I could give you a hug. You are wonderful.

I am sitting here sweating and having hot flushes/flashes and cursing the heat and humidity. I wish I could teleport back to Ontario where I was able to leap outside into the glorious white stuff whenever I got too hot. I was born in a much cooler climate and I don't think my body has ever adapted to heat. Just on a serious note, on the LE thread, several women have recommended a book about preventing and/or treating this dreaded thing. I have had a bit of a scare after flying, with my arm swelling a bit and feeling achier than normal. I want to do everything possible to avoid LE and think I will try to get this book. It's called \"Lymphedema: A Breast Cancer Patient's Guide to Prevention & Healing\" (2nd edition) by Jeannie Burt & Gwen White. One reader said that deep breathing is hugely beneficial in stimulating the major lymphatic vessels and this helps the lymph to drain away. Hugs, gb ",

What a worry for you and how good of your son to send a reassuring text message. When your kids are young, you worry about ear infections and relatively small things but you are there with them to make it all better. When they grow up and are far away and communication is a bit limited and you are unsure of their whole situation...what a worry it is! I will say a prayer for his safety. Karen, I would challenge that ticket. If you have a good record they should be easier on you. Each of my sons challenged their first tickets and were let off with a warning - and they were speeding fines. Yours is a very minor thing - you weren't endangering anyones life for pete's sake! And heck - play the bootface card if it seems appropriate - whip the wig off before you go in to talk to them and you won't have to mention the c word! Sue, is it Thursday you see your doctor? I want you to get some reassurance about the pain in your side. It is sure to be due to overwork - you are such a trojan worker. I wish you could see a good physiotherapist who is trained in lymphology. Even if the pain is due to the chemo, there is bound to be lymph building up and it can be so uncomfortable. I saw my LE therapist yesterday and she taped up my back, snb scar and main scar and now the lymph is flowing again - such a relief! Ulla, enjoy your food! It's so good to hear you sounding a bit better. As Auntie Em says, you are young and it's so much easier to lose weight then - it used to fall of me when I was in my 30s. Different story now!  Lisa, I should give you my hair-raising potion for fighting your cold. It involves lots of fresh garlic, ginger, chilli, honey and lemon juice. It scares the virus out of your body! I hope you are feeling better soon. Hi Mel - my thoughts are with you.

I was looking after a horse once and she got down on her knees, crawled into a low shed, removed the lid of a container and guzzled down the grain mix that I kept there for my chickens. A big no-no for a horse. I was so worried about her, rang her owner and then the vet. She was ok but I was so worried. I really leaned a lesson over that incident. How on earth do animals get lids off when they don't have hands?! Lisa - so great to know that Oliver is safely home. He is sure to make a quick recovery with you as his carer. Judie - I hope you are ok with all your hard work. I do admire your attitude though. The new apartment sounds lovely.  My eldest son James is going to the airport today to meet a girl he spent some time with overseas. They may be coming up here to stay the night as they have to go back and pick up her sister tomorrow who couldn't get on the same flight. I think James is hoping to matchmake the sister with Will (his brother). Then they are all meeting up with my ex (boys father) to go hiking in some mountains further south.

They should be making a special effort to get all the results out to people before Christmas. It's sure to be fine but you will worry.  I'm so sorry that you are missing dear Zippy so much. He was such a special cat. In my experience, black and white cats have such pizzaz. My dear cat, the one I had to have put to sleep last year, was black and white. Now I have a little grey girl and I'm sending you one of her licks, one leg rub and a curled-in-the-lap good vibe to help you feel better. xxxx Karen - that is just GREAT NEWS about the good result from your dh's tests. I'm glad that you got the results so quickly - I wish it was that way all around the world.",

It sounds pretty benign to me - fantastic!! Ulla, glad you are feeling a bit better. You are often in my thoughts and I try to picture you in the cold, dark north. Spring is coming and with it, better days. We get house here and it's great. I enjoy American Idol too and So you think you can dance - that's amazing to watch. We also have Australian Idol and that is really funny too - a lot of people must just go on there so they can get their 15 minutes of fame for being terrible singers! Lisa, my sons are all in their 20s. James, the eldest, turned 29 last week, then there's Heath -26 and then William who also had a birthday last week -he's just turned 23. James is currently travelling with Will. Will wants to teach in London when he gets there. James does lots of creative things - photography, web design, graphic art etc. Will is a high school teacher and Heath has just left his current job (similar to James - he is a photographer as well) and is travelling (in the US at present) and then he wants to do some sort of volunteer work in India or a 3rd world country. I miss them but I am glad they are doing this while they are young and before they settle down. I am sitting here sweltering and there is a big thunder storm coming so I should unplug my computer as we don't have a power surge protector. I think I will go to Curves and work up an even bigger sweat as I have been inactive all day. Sleep well everybody. gb. xxx ",

I cannot even begin to imagine the horror of it all, how terrifying it has been for all those involved . I flew to Brisbane overnight to see my very frail mother. It was so good to see her again and she is a bit better. Going back to see her again next Sunday for several days. Will be out of email contact for the next few days. Love to you all, Jane xoxo",

Nettie, hope you are doing ok. xxx  Judie, the final death toll in the fires is expected to reach beyond 300 people and over a million animals which would include native animals, sheep, cows, horses and domestic pets. There are people in hospital with horrific burns and animals who are being treated as well. I wish that all houses in these bushfire prone areas could have concrete bunkers under them. The danger is not over yet as there are several huge fires still burning out of control. Survivors are living in tent cities on sports ovals. It is believed that these fires were lit by sickos who get some sort of power trip by seeing the fires blaze and destroy all in their path. If caught, they will be charged with mass murder.

I have never been near a bushfire (I think you call them wildfires there) and find it hard to imagine just how dreadful it would be - to people, animals and everything its path. I don't know how fire fighters can stand the extreme heat of the weather coupled with the unbelievably sweltering furnace. With a fire this huge, there is really nothing that can be done to stop it. There is an Australia-wide charity drive to raise funds for the victims of this tragedy. Oh yes, they are charging a man with arson. If he did it, he must have a very sick mind. Some fires are started by lightening strikes but quite a few are intentionally lit.  Karen,  Tinker is lucky to have you as her special human. It's so sad that she is deteriorating but I am sure you know what is best for her. She is no doubt enjoying being spoiled rotten! Ok, I am going to shut up my laptop and do some house cleaning.

Having had LE mildly (it has been so much better the last 6 months) I think it would be horrible to have a worse dose of it. Getting it attended to in the early stages is so important. Repetitive work, hot baths/showers/washing up in hot water, any trauma to the surgery-side arm, insect bites, cuts, all put you at risk of developing lymphoedema. Surgery to the breast itself and radiation can be all it takes to develop LE. Removal of nodes adds to this risk and of course the more nodes you have removed, the greater the risk. Karen, I hope your day out distracted you from sadness and worry. Love you curls - you look gorgeous! Sheila - praying that your MIL will continue to do well. Colon bootface is one of the most curable. I have two first cousins who have had it (one early, one not so early) and both are doing extremely well (one of those cousins had it about 20 years ago). Judie - I think the quilt made out of your son's shirts is a beautiful idea. What better way to remember him.

You are getting there - I know the time is going so slowly but we are there with you.  I can't wait for this surgery to be behind you. Each one of us beside you on this ride - can you sense us all around you? I hope your pain has eased. The Diazepam will help you through the last few days so it's only until Friday that you have to endure the intense, non-chemical-assisted waiting. I didn't know this site existed when I was waiting for my surgery so I used to knit, knit, knit - it was like a meditation and somehow soothing. I knitted myself a comfort shawl and I finished it the night before my mastectomy. It was warm and cosy and easy to drape around my shoulders when I was still stiff and sore. I wish I could drape it around your shoulders now but I think all of our prayers, love and empathy are a bit like a warm shawl - draw it around you and feel us close to you. love and hugs, gb ps - Karen - I honestly didn't feel excluded. These threads shrink the space between us and I just feel part of a wonderful community. You like the puppy? I wish it was mine! It's a beagle. I really want to get a puppy next year, when I get a better fence around my yard. I haven't really decided what breed yet but beagles are gorgeous. My last dog was a blue heeler cattle dog.   ",

My brother has yelled at my sister because he thinks he could have handled things sooo much better re my mother and it has caused my sister so much added stress. Elaine, vent as much as you like. We live in such a different world now. Once, families members tended to live relatively close to their aging parents and were able to share the load. Now, we tend to scatter around the country and when our parents need extra care, it's not easy to be there to give it. And now, all the business/financial worries caused by this recession make things so much worse. Judie - what is \"improve\"? Whatever it is, I'm glad Devin is doing it - sounds impressive! Tea tree remedy - mmm - probably should have some of that. I coughed all night again.  Cathi - prayers and hugs for and to you and your daugher. Karen - do they exfoliate and moisturise your dry bits (like elbows) before they apply the fake tan? I'm sure you will look fantastic when it's all done. Love to everyone, Jane xxx ",

This wouldn't apply to you because you are lovely and slim but we all eat a little too much at times! My sister had gall stones and some extremely painful attacks (mine has never been very bad at all) but by controlling her diet she doesn't have problems any more. I think you can have gall stones bombarded with sonar or something (or is that kidney stones?) which is far less invasive than surgery.  By the way, I love the photo of you and your family in LV.

Is it brisk and bright for walking or rainy, stay-at-home weather? It must be getting quite cold over there now. I am very weird - I love cold weather! I live in a very warm to hot climate and our \"cold\" weather is a bit of a novelty - I'd probably complain if it lasted for months and months though. We get a really interesting program here from England called \"Grand Designs\" about the designing and building of really beautiful houses. They cost a fortune and are always built in the most stunningly beautiful countryside. Sometimes they convert old mills and castles into modern houses while keeping lots of the original features. It's great escapism - I could never afford a house like that but it's fun watching! We used to get Coronation Street here but I was too young then to get interested in it. I think I remember another British soap - The Eastenders? Most of our soapies are American (The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of Our Lives) and Australian (Neighbours and Home & Away).

Both situations have their benefits and I am not saying that one is superior to the other. I guess you just have to decide what is best for you. Sue - I like the sound of the Scotish castle with a roaring fire. I would love to explore the far north of Scotland - such a wild, fresh place...You need a holiday girl - whether it's a hot beachy one or a cool northern one! Wow - Val, Lisa and Nancy - a fun Sunday in NYC! That sounds fantastic! Hope you can do it soon! Ulla - I really feel for you and your diet struggle. Please don't be too hard on yourself though - these strict diets - so hard to keep to. Yet I do admire you for your determination. I need to be more determined! Good luck with it all! Mel - thank you for your beautiful words - you are always so uplifting. How's your hair? Love to all, Jane xox ",

After your horrific year and then a scare with your scar. I too feel that it will be fine. The green gunk is surely a great indication that it was just an infection. Not fair that you have had to return to the operating theatre and remain conscious and aware - no surprise that you are having these terrible nightmares. I hope you can reprogram your brain to dream about something peaceful or a deep and dreamless sleep. Fumi - pleeeeease check in. I hope you are having a fantastic time but I wish we knew you were ok.

Lisa - great to see you there. Hope you are doing ok. I don't know what has been happening in your life lately - still working hard I see. Are you feeling better after your last surgery? Is Dennis still on the scene? How are all your beautiful daughters? Nancy - sounds like a huge weekend at your place. Your dad is doing well to be still driving at 90 - wow! However, maybe he shouldn't be! So many older people find it very difficult to give up the freedom of driving. I can understand why but when they put themselves and others in danger, it's time to find another mode of transport. Hope you have fun with all your rellies (relatives). I too, wonder at what length you can get hair extensions. Brittany seemed to go from bald to long locks overnight - maybe she wore a wig for a while? By the look of your pretty face, you will look good in whatever colour or length you decide to go with.  Ok, back to the grindstone before it gets too hot. Love you all!",

Hugs to you - it stinks having to wait and wait for these blasted procedures to be over and done with. Praying that it will all be benign. Love to UB too. I had a bit of a scary moment today with my mammo. Went in feeling really confident - even suggested to my surgeon that as I was getting older that I didn't need u/s as well as my breast probably wasn't as dense as it used to be. He suggested that we wait and see how the mammo went. Mammo went well and I was told to wait in the cubicle with my gown on while they viewed the pics but then (I should be used to this by now) was called back in to have more pics done (I hate it when they put that tiny little plate on and press then apply the full force onto such a small area. Yowwwch!  The radiologist then showed me a white lump that hadn't been there last year so I had to go back in and have an ultrasound. That hurt too and they seemed to be interested in something under my arm as well. (I think I was imagining things by then!) I really thought the worst but, thankfully, they said it was just a new cyst. I have a sore breast tonight. It still feels squashed and the skin has split underneath from being stretched  and pulled onto the mammo plate. Very glad it's over for another year.  Jane xxx ",

We sat on the verandah and watched the stars come out and for the second night in a row saw the international space station go over - looking like a huge, bright star scooting across the sky. The stars were so bright and the Milky Way was easy to see. Then we came inside and watched the Sydney fireworks on tv, wishing we had made the effort to go down and see them but it was nice not to battle traffic and crowds.

Valerie, I ususally wait until nobody is around when I come to this site because they think I am not putting my experience behind me. I can't leave though - I want to know how each of you are doing. You are all inspiring, great people and I don't want to forget any of you. I know it's sad to welcome new members of this club but I think that those of us who continue to post after bootface can inspire these newbies & offer some comfort.

It's so horrible that you have to wait so long to know exactly what you are dealing with.  Bee - I wish you all the best and hope that you get help soon from the Wellness Foundation.

Your words are always like soothing warm honey. I love reading what you say. Thank you for being here. Leesa - If you are well enough to work a couple of days here and there, it will probably help you emotionally. A familiar and supportive workplace and the awareness that you are helping others can be a powerful antidote.  Sue - where are you?! How are you? I do miss not seeing you here.

I have been away, supposedly renovating my old house but all I did was look after all my men! (2 sons, dh & his friend). I wanted to paint one of the bedrooms but all I did was cook, clean up, shop, wash up (no dishwasher like I have here!) and make cups of tea. Also, I have a UTI so I wasn't feeling the best. However, we drove back here today and had lunch at my favourite restaurant and then went shopping for a new table - no luck yet. It's been a nice day though. I have just read back over all your posts ( I don't have the internet on any more at my old house) and there are so many of you with stress, worry and sadness. AE & UB - #*+%$#@&^ bootface worries - I am so sorry you have to wait for 6 weeks - it's sure to be nothing but what a stinking long time to have to wait to know for sure. Praying the time will not drag too badly and that you have a very, very boring result. Btw, I love the expression of that birthday cat's face - priceless! Karen, I a so sorry you have this sad dilemma over poor Tinker. It's especially difficult when your dh doesn't particularly like her and the expense of course. I think the other ladies are right about knowing when is the right time to let a pet go. My dear old cat had an intestinal tumour the same year that I had bootface (2007) and the vet told me that he was only going to suffer and that an operation wouldn't work. Anyway, it seems that Tinker's problem is not bootface but something else. What to do? Can they tell you how expensive it would be to treat? Cheryl, big hugs and prayers for you for tomorrow. I hope you are feeling ok about your decision. Many of us feel that we will have less worry about recurrence if we have mastectomies and some of us don't have a choice. Even though I immediately agreed with my surgeon about a mastectomy, I was sad that I had to go through with it. It really annoys me too when doctors say, \"Well, if you were younger, a recon would be good but heck, your'e over 50 so you probably don't need one\"! What the....? That is just soooooo insulting and insensitive. I can think of some very cutting come-backs to comments like these... Cathi, what a rotten time you are having - I hope you were aloud to go home and that you are feeling better and taking things easy. You are a brave woman to soldier on but I'm glad your dh insisted on taking you to hospital. I had to laugh about his threatening to tell the medical people that you were crazy and incapable of making an informed choice about your treatment! He sounds like a very funny and loving man. Sue, I'm angry that you don't have your mammo results yet but I think it means that your results are so boringly benign that they can't be bothered getting back to you. So glad that your sinus cleared up a bit with the meds. Sinus can be so painful. I had it for several months once and it hurt and made me feel dull-headed and weak. Lisa - I am so happy that you are feeling better but the fall on the ice sounds nasty. I hope you didn't hit your head. The arm is sure to be ok - just watch it for any LE symptoms like tingling and tightness. I fell on the ice twice when I was in Canada just over a year ago - one minute I was vertical, next minute staring up at the sky! Mel - I would love to hear that you, Judie, Karen and Jule were going to meet up. I hope that happens one day! ((((((((((Judie)))))))))) - if you are reading this - I'm thinking of you and praying that you will find comfort and solace with people you feel comfortable with. I hope you touch base here from time to time but you need to do what is best for you at this time and in the future. xoxo  My brain is fogging up as it's after 11 and it's been a long day - have to go and hit the hay. Love to all you wonderful people. oxoxoxxo ",

I am also sad that you are feeling down. It must be very depressing to have bleak weather for so long. I am thrilled that you can go to Arizona to see your sister - that is sure to do you a power of good. I imagine that a typical winter's day in Arizona would be a cold night followed by a bright, sunny day so soak up some rays and make your pineal glad happy again! Is there any way that you can see an LE specialist before you go to your sister's. Often there is no visual sign of LE but the lymph may be pooling. A flight on top of that may not be the best thing unless you could get a LE specialist to show you how to wrap your arm pre-flight.  My sister is arriving on Monday morning and I can't wait to see her. I haven't seen her for months - nearly a year I think.  Sue - I am thrilled over your benign mammo! I'm hoping that once the 2 years post dx is up that your anxiety will decrease a bit. I think we all have these fears when we have our tests and I guess we will for the rest of our lives but many of those who fought of bootface a decade or so ago say that it is just a distant memory and the worry is much, much less. I'm sorry about you aching teeth - hope the dentist fixes you up soon. Nancy - you poor thing - that must have been a very bad fall. I hope you are feeling better soon. My son had concussion in early December from falling on the ice and he had headaches for  weeks but he is a typical impatient young man who wants to be on the go all the time. I believe that if you take it really easy for the first week and allow things to heal that you will get better much quicker - are you able to do that? My son said it felt like his head exploded when he fell. It makes me feel slightly sick to think of anyone's poor head hitting a hard surface like ice. I also think it would be a good idea if you could see an LE person - the tingling could just be your nerves but it might be the early stages of LE... Wasn't that crash landing on the Hudson River in NY amazing?! What a thing to have lived through and what a brilliant pilot! And so wonderful that the ferries were all around to rescue the people. I wonder if some of those survivors now feel bullet proof? There was a movie about surviving a plane crash once - can't remember the name of it but the survivors felt as though they could survive anything else that life dished out to them. Cheryl, I am especially thinking and praying for you. Please feel our collective love, prayers and understanding as you go through all this time of waiting and fear. We are right here with you on the Yellow Brick Road to hold your hand. Karen - I am so hoping that those pills work for Tinker. I think that you would know if she was in pain. If she's eating, she probably feels ok. When my last cat had bootface he would not eat and the vet said he was suffering so I didn't hesitate to have him put to sleep. I knew that he had a happy life and I didn't want him to live his last days in pain.  Love to you all and also AE (fingers crossed and prayers for b9, b9, b9), UB, Ulla, Sheila, Shirlann, AnnNY & Ann in Colarado, Dawn, Mel, Judie, Wren, Jule, Kaloni, Cathi (hope you are feeling better), Fumi, Leesa, Suebee, Shari and anyone I may have missed.

You and Ed are beacons of love and consistency in their lives, even though you don't see them much. They can see that not all adults are neglectful and useless. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that they got a dog! Why do so many people in their situation, who can't even look after themselves, get a pet?! And of course, it's usually a pitbull, a rotty or some other breed that, if not trained correctly, will become a dangerous brute - poor animals - they can't help it - it's their cruel and stupid owners who are responsible.

I hope you have a great time. I will look forward to hearing about it. Yes, welcome to Keymic and Susan - I have started a \"little\" list of everyone to jog my memory so I have added you both to it to help remember everyone. I'm glad you found this forum - but I'm sorry that you have to be here, members of a club that most of us never thought we would be joining.  Lisa - your new friend sounds very interesting - good to talk to, tall, young enough to be energetic and enthusiastic, wealthy - wow - that's a lot of important boxes ticked! I have a feeling about you - I suspect that very soon you are going to meet your soulmate - it may not be this guy (it might be!) - but I just think it will happen! I hope you have a great date with him next week!  Nancy - you make some good points about LE. The massage and associated therapies for LE are simply wonderful - they made a huge difference to me.  Dear, sweet Sue - we love you and care about you! I hope you have made an appointment! I collected my sweet Blossom from her \"pet penthouse\" this morning and she is giving me lots of love. I think it will be a few days before she will let me out of her sight!

We have a show here called \"The Farmer Wants a Wife\". I watched it for the first time last week. Two or 3 young women are sent to each farm. Understandably, the farmer wants a wife who can help him (or her - there is one woman farmer looking for a husband) but most of the contestants are from the city and wouldn't know one end of a cow from the other! Last week, shortly after the women arrived, one of the farmers got them to test his cows to see if they were pregnant. I won't go into detail here about what they had to do....!!!  Love to everyone, Jane xxx",

I don't think you were wrong to  do it either - you were driven to it because he won't communicate. Mmmm - what to do now though? This information that she gave you is really disturbing. Why has he changed? It could be any number of things. Perhaps, as a seemingly carefree young man, it was easier to party and have fun than be aggressive? Did one of his relationships between then and when he married you cause him to be like this? He obviously has something going on that he is ashamed/angry/resentful about and doesn't want to admit to it. I hate that you don't have his loving support. You've been through so much in the last few years and you don't need this. Could you talk to somebody trustworthy - a counsellor, pastor or somebody really wise who has some insight? Somebody who could possibly talk to him? This needs to be resolved for yours and your children's sakes. I should be concerned about him too but... Well, of course it would be wonderful if he could be reached and encouraged to talk (he's obviously not happy either) but how is that going to be achieved? I really, really hate it when I hear about women in this situation.

I didn't have chemo so I can only imagine how it must feel. The other women in my support group said how their heads hurt - shaving seemed to take the pain away. I hope and pray you get some satisfaction with your finances. It's wonderful that your doctors are so nice. I am sure that a good 'bedside manner' helps with the whole treatment and healing process. I will keep praying that stinking bootface shrinks away to zero.  Leesa - I loved hearing about your darling grandkids. They sound so lovable! I want grandchildren! Can't see it happening any time soon though. Eldest son has a new girlfriend. Middle son is in love with a German girl who can't visit until September and youngest son has a sweet girl from Baton Rouge, Louisiana visiting him for 10 days during her spring break from university. He met her in London last year. She and I went to the art gallery today and had a great time. I wonder if things will develop there? She's talking about coming to live in Sydney when she finishes uni...? The trouble with all these overseas romances though is that, if it turns really serious, somebody has to leave their country and that's a pretty major thing.  Sue, hugs and good thoughts to you for tomorrow's onc's visit. You will be fine of course but I'm sure you can think of a lot of other things you would prefer to do! Glad the teabags were soothing on your sore eyes. I so agree with you about dear AE & UB - they are precious and wonderful people.  Cathi - lol! Did you mean to say that Margot is a pisser or a kisser?! The little sweetheart! I would love to get a dog but I don't know how my cat would cope. Was reading an article today about introducing a new pet to a cat. It said to keep the new pet in a separate room and give each pet things to smell that the other has been using. Then, after a few days to let them see and maybe sniff each other through a narrowly opened door. Sounds like a lot of work! How is your daughter? Has she got any results back yet?  Karen - I agree with the others - you DO look like Julia Roberts - only much better! You might feel fat but you certainly don't look it! Don't be so hard on yourself - you are gorgeous. I always write too much and then I don't get to mention everybody. Thinking of you all anyway. Love to everyone, Jane xxx ",

It stinks that he has to go through more chemo but if it helps keep the vile bootface at bay... Yes, it's fall in the mountains. We only have one or two deciduous native trees in this country so lots of exotics have been planted - especially here in the mountains and they are just starting to be tinged in their autumn colours. Nights are cool and it's nice for walking. Don't have any energy at the moment though as I have a bad cough which wakes me up at 2am.

I have done a couple of courses and made quite nice things each time but there was a lot of input from the teacher! (And quite a lot of unpicking!)

Nets - lovely to hear from you too and so glad you are starting to feel a bit better after your nasty upper respiratory bug. I hope you have a few great days before you have to face chemo again. The shopping, apple tarts and Guinness all sound very therapeutic! Barb, did you try to strangle that doctor after you woke up?! AE, I would love UB to post here on a regular basis - he would be SO welcome! You are both precious to us. Cathi - I'm praying that Jaclyn will get good results on her pathology. So sorry she ended up in the ER - that must have been so scary.  Lisa - so great to hear from you. You work so hard - I hope you have some time off soon to relax and use some of that paycheck on something nice... Leesa - it must be so gratifying to work with such kind and caring doctors. We need more of them! On another slant, I think that a great doctor might be difficult to be married to or have as a parent - he/she would be all used up on sympathy and caring by the time the working day was over. Doctors kids always tell me they got little sympathy when they got sick as kids! A day off school when sick was hard to come by! Karen! Great to see you back and that you had a good time. I agree though, there's no place like home! Love to everyone, Jane xoxox",

Nettie - hope you continue to feel ok after the chemo and that you were able to go out with your friends. Hollyhocks sound beautiful & exciting about the greenhouse Cathi - sending you, Jaclyn & Alexcis all my best thoughts & wishes and prayers. Praying that Jaclyn can have this treated effectively without having to do chemo. This must be so hard for you as her mother. Watching your kids go through difficulties is the worst thing. Nancy, I hope your father continues to do well and that he can reach the point where he has some autonomy - even if it's just doing basic things for himself as it will make him feel happier.  I love all the photos of the beautiful cats and the sweet Margot. Those wicker pet baskets are so cute. Judie - you are going to need a good rest after this time with your grandson. Must be great to spend time with the little darling though! (((((((Cheryl))))))) - how are you feeling? Is the infection inproving? Mel, thank you for your posts - so warm, loving and comforting. You are such a sweetheart. Chris & I have come up to my old house for Easter. It's great to catch up with my kids, some old friends and continue with the never-ending renovations (grrrr! - it's taking an embarrassingly long time!). We have a friend staying, the boys have a friend staying too so it's a full house. Lots of sleeping bags and airbeds on the floor as there is not much furniture left. Great to cook for a crowd again although we went out to dinner with friends last night.  Karen, I hope you are having a few happy moments and that you are able to distract yourself from thinking too much. I pray that whatever is causing your pain and discomfort is able to be be easily treated. I hate that you have these worries and difficulties. Waiting is the pits - especially over a long weekend. Hugs, love happy Easter to everyone, mentioned and not mentioned. Jane xoxox",

You have a great attitude - we should all try to emulate it! Ulla - I am also thrilled with your NED result! Congratulations! It's just great to hear you sound so happy. I have yearly mammograms and ultrasounds. They even mammogrammed by axilla on the mx side last time. (((((((Suebee))))))), you have so much sadness in your life - I'm so sorry. Lisa's advice seems good to me. We all need a bit of chemical help sometimes to deal with life and health issues. Lisa, I think your girls are at an age now where they want to see you happy. With younger children there is the fear that a new partner will change relationships within the family and they feel threatened or protective of their parent. My youngest son cried his eyes out when I told him I was getting married again. I felt dreadful for him. He soon adjusted though and was happy. Dennis sounds so lovely that I am sure your girls will like and accept him. I am so happy that you have his love and support as you approach this surgery - it will help you to heal. Judie, I love how you express yourself! That is so true - life is such a mix of joys and hurts.  Karen, it's so great to see you. I think of you each day and wonder how you and your family are. xxx Love to everyone here - those I've mentioned and those I haven't. I hope you all have some happy times this weekend. Jane xxx ",

Fumi - I have lost count! How many days to go now? I am excited for you! Did I say how much I love your photos? They are fabulous!  I hope Sue is having a wonderful time in Spain - or was it the Canary Islands? Sue - I am just so happy that you are having a holiday after all your hard work and the trauma of the last year.  Mel - so good to hear from you and to know that you had a nice time with your son and his partner. It's great when you know that your kids are contented - but so horrible when you know they are going through difficulties. Thinking of you and your SO and hoping that he is getting the help he needs. I also hope that you remember to do something for yourself from time to time. Nancy - I hope Emily loves her last year of school and is able to pursue her dream when she finishes...fashion design - how glamorous and exciting! She is sure to excel. Lisa - all my best wishes for a very successful surgery and a smooth recovery. I hope Olivia has a great year too and does really well.

I know you will worry until you have it checked though. I thought you were on holidays! I had imagined you lying in the sun in Spain and being chased by handsome Spaniards... Mel, this is also not fair that you have these worries in your life. I so hope that your SO will like the doctor and listen to him. I will pray that the doctor has the right manner and approaches him in a way that will get his attention. I'm sending you gentle hugs,lots of love and my best thoughts.  Hi to beautiful Judie in her cool pad downtown! I love your sweet smile - such a great pic of you! Kaloni - I need to get cracking like you and pack my boxes. I love the idea of your pet rescue service. I wish I could send you all my neighbours' pets! Karen - love to you sweet girl - I often think of you and wonder how you are. Losing your father is so hard. I still dream about mine and he died when I was 24 - a long time ago. Ulla - it is early days yet after your treatment. Please don't punish your body with too much lettuce - I think you need a weekly treat - just a small one that you can look forward to!

Cheryl, I was so glad to see your post but so very sorry about your bad reaction to the last chemo all the rotten pain and now a cold. As far as I am concerned, I don't mind what people post - so long as it doesn't hurt anyone else's feelings. We all have things in common but we all come from different backgrounds and have a huge range of experiences and reactions to these experiences so individual feelings are perfectly valid. Please feel free to vent! It's good for you to get things off your chest. It's a pity you missed out on the LBFB workshop but when you feel better, you will have more fun with it. Good to hear that you are getting your art started again - should be good therapy.  Wren, what a rough time you have had too - so sorry to hear about it all. Hair disasters are no fun but I had to laugh at your description of a \"Howdy Doody strawberry blonde with no areolars\"! I have heard many women say they are not happy with the initial colour (of their tats) but they usually seem to come right or they get them re-done. Good luck with it. My goodness - the intestinal infection sounds dreadful and the worry over your daughter as well...then the skin fold op. I think you have good cause to have a rant. Hope everything is smooth sailing from now on. Loved hearing about your sweet hubby and his tat - the dear man. Sue - hope you are resting and feeling better! Karen - hope you are feeling better too and that you can get some relief from all the pain. Love your photos on FB. Chase is too cute and you look great even though I know you weren't feeling well. Bill - loved your post! You are fantastic! Please come back again soon!  Must go to sleep. Love to all! xoxox PS - Lisa - love your laid back attitude to your dating - the latest two guys sound very promising - have fun on your dates! And remember - we want all the juice as Barb says!!",

Just know that you are loved and very dear to us. I am constantly praying for a good result. Oh, and don't go anywhere near a knife! We will all send mental daggers at that lump instead. Karen, what a beautiful girl Portia is! She doesn't need to dye her hair! Anyway she is pretty no matter what colour her hair is. Most of us went through the dye stage as teenagers. I know you are still very sad about your father. Sadness is so debilitating. It will gradually pass. One day you will be able to smile at your dad's memory instead of just feeling pain. Wren - hope your cold passes quickly - it can make you feel so rotten!  Sue - I checked in here at 2.15 this morning! Why was I up at that hour? My phone rang! I leapt out of bed to answer it and there was nobody there! I immediately thought it was one of the boys - an emergency...or more likely a prank caller. I couldn't go back to sleep then for ages.

Congratulations on your 22 year anniverary! What a lot can happen in that time. It's a relatively short period but so many life changing things can happen in that time that it seems like much longer...22 years ago I was living in Southampton, England with my husband and our kids. Oldest son was at school, my middle one was just starting school and my baby was 21 months old. We were planning a weeks trip to France and Germany and then to Scotland. I was unaware that my husband was having an affair and that I would soon leave him. A lot of water under the bridge since then! Jane ",

The weekend will be such fun - just what you need and will help you heal. Love the photos - beautiful girls you all are! Yes, you could easily be sisters. Mathew is the cutest boy! So adorable! And Oliver - what a great shot - love the tongue! Sheila - I was horrified to read about your injuries from your first husband and so glad that you were able to distance yourself from him. My first husband wasn't physically violent but there was a lot of emotional abuse - no physical bruises but still a lot of hurt. Shirlann - how wonderful to be present at the birth of your grandchild! It must have been so special! I would love to do that. My sister was with a friend as she gave birth last year and she found it incredibly moving. Nancy, you shouldn't have had to work so hard around the birth of your baby - what a difficult time it must have been for you. I find it incredible that your husband didn't want to look after his sweet little baby! Kinclan, my best wishes to you for a long and healthy life. That is great that your gene test came back negative.  Judie - I completely agree with you about fall. Spring tends to be windy and unpredictable (and the heat of summer comes all too quickly!) but autumn is perfect - cool nights, beautiful sunny days. I am imagining the gorgeous colours of the trees changing. You live in such a beautiful part of the world. Sue - I'll bet you are working flat out, crowding as much into your days as you can. Probably not a bad idea too - it will make the time go more quickly. This waiting is horrible. I am praying and keeping everything crossed for you.   Ulla - I hope you are enjoying the beautiful weather in Sweden. My sons just spent a few weeks travelling through the Scandinavian countries and such a great time. Karen - how are plans coming along for your new house? I hope Chase has a great time at kindergarten. Is that the first year of elementary school?  Kaloni - have you moved yet or are you just working up to it? I wish I had never said that I was moving - it's taking so long that I feel silly! Mel, thank you for your beautiful prayers, photos, and just being you and being here.  Love to all of you and to Jule, Ann, AE & UB, Fumi (can't wait to hear from you!)

I have been walking to the public library nearly every day to get on the net for half an hour and the time goes so quickly. By the time I've read my emails and replied to them there is no time to check in here. I just read the last few pages of posts. Karen - how are you feeling? I think you have the flu or something. I hope you are starting to feel better. So happy to read that UB's test came back NED - hugs to you UB. AE - you will be in my prayers for the 12th. I wish you didn't have to wait so long. May it come back all benign.  Dawn - I loved the picture. You are so pretty and so is your daughter. How wonderful that your dad has a girlfriend. It must have been a great party. Sue - how's your head? Did the heat treatment work? I'm so glad you had a great holiday. I bet the boys loved having you to themselves. Ulla - beautiful! Very MM! Glad your husband is safely home.   Leesa - you are doing it tough. I'm glad you have your dear little grandson to keep you smiling. Cathi - I felt so warm and happy for you when I read about your wonderful husband. I am so happy that you found him after having such a dud husband the first time around. Similar situation for me. I now have a good man after an emotionally abusive one. I too had to sneak away with the kids and left everything behind. Lisa - ditto - I am so glad that you found Dennis. He sounds just right for you and it's so great that he compliments you and shows you how much he cares. You sure do deserve it. Shirlann - a cruise to Hawaii - fantastic! Have a wonderful time. Sheila - lots of testosterone eh? I bet you love having them there with you. It must be so thrilling to have John safely home again. You will have a joyful Christmas. Wren - congratulations on your nipples. When do you get your tattoos? It must be a great feeling to be whole again. Judie - I think you are great to persevere with the exercise. It certainly helps with the sleeping. I didn't sleep well last night so I made myself walk twice today.  Judy, welcome . I hope something turns up for you. It is hard to find work but with your experience and capabilities you are sure to be snapped up by an employer who values these things. Fumi - that is such great news about your friend becoming a grandma next year - and you too! My niece in Canada is expecting her second baby in June. Well, I went to see a plastic surgeon yesterday. I was considering having a DIEP recon. Trouble is, even with medical insurance, it is sooo expensive. I need to find a job quickly - or win the lottery. My eldest son came home about 10 days ago. It was so great to see him again. He had 4 stitches in his chin and concussion. He had fallen heavily on the ice while skating in Vancouver. He's ok now, thank goodness. My youngest son is due to fly in on the 12th December. If middle son wasn't flying to Bali 2 days later, I would have them all home for Christmas.  Love to all Jane xoxo ",

When I was in hospital, the breast care nurse showed me how to anchor the bra to my panties with a piece of elastic like those ones that women used to wear to hold their stockings up before pantihose. I've also read that you can put round pebbles into your bra, rice, dried beans etc to give it some weight. I wish reconstruction could be included in the cost of the mastectomy! (For the same cost - not extra). I know someone whose total cost for recon (she had a tram flap) was $30,000. I don't know how much she got back from her insurance but even if it was $15,000 -$20,000 it's still a huge amount. I got my hopes up the last few weeks, thinking I might be able to have a DIEP but it's just going to cost too much and there are so many other expenses just living day to day. I guess I will just have to learn to love my flat side! And you are right there are little miracles and joys each day. I need to hold on to that thought.",

I hope something can be done for her. Are you over your cold/flu and feeling a bit better? Sheila - I must try the olive leaf capsules next time I have a cold. It certainly worked well for you. I have a potion that I make up which is warm and soothing with garlic, fresh ginger, honey and lemon juice with a pinch of chilli powder. It always works.  Mel - it was so great to see you post! I often think of you and pray that things will work out well for you - soon! It's annoying not having easy access to a computer. It took us ages to get it organised after moving house.

Cheryl, my thoughts and prayers are also with you, that you are able to put your worst fears aside while you wait more definite news. Enduring this waiting over the holidays must be extremely difficult as everything seems to close up and it seems that it will take forever to get a plan of action drawn up. Sue, I hope you can get checked out soon by a medical person who gives you time and attention - to put your mind at ease. However, I do agree with the others - I wish you could leave your current job. You are an extremely valuable, conscientious worker with a wealth of experience. I am sure you would be very employable if you left this job that is eating away at you. I so wish you could find an employer who appreciated you and didn't work you ragged. It's not fair!  My S/O is with me for a week (he usually stays in the city during the week due to his work) so it's just so great to have a relaxing time together. Today we are planting herbs in the garden. We went out for coffee earlier. Two of my sons and their overseas visitors (two Canadian sisters) came and stayed for a couple of days. They are on a road trip up the coast, camping on beaches and staying with friends. It was so great to have them all - nice to cook up generous servings for a change - seems to make cooking really worth it! Must get back to the gardening.

Karen, the weight thing is so depressing isn't it? I've been walking to town every day which is involves several very steep hills and I've been watching what I eat (all the articles about losing weight talk about \"mindful eating\", eating slowly and mainly whole foods). Well, I'm doing all that and nothing seems to be happening! Perhaps if I persevere, the weight will come off gradually? I hope so!  Well... I'm off to wield a paintbrush.

Sue - thrilled to hear that you are going on holidays. Will it be warm there? I hope you have a fantastic time - with lots of sun, delicious food, fun with your dear boys and total relaxation. Ulla - how was the exam? Please let us know how you went. I am so happy that you are doing so well. My best wishes to Cathi - you are having a rough time. Be prepared to have emotional ups and downs after your surgery and be gentle with yourself. Mel - how are things with you? I do hope that your SO is doing ok and that you are having some happy moments. Hugs to you, sweet one. Sorry to you and everyone else if I am out of touch - I just don't have the time to catch up on all your posts over the last few weeks. Hi to AE & UB. How are your preparations going for the move to Florida? You must be keen to go before the really cold weather starts...or does it not get very cold where you are now? I love the springtime in the mountains - amazed at the variety of flowers in my garden. I wonder how I will cope with my first winter there?! I say I like cool weather but...mmm, we will see! Hi Judie, I often think of you. Hope you have settled in better and are having some happy times. You are responsible for naming my sweet cat (Blossom) so she reminds me of you! Bloss is staying in a cattery at the moment. It is run by some really sweet English people who do a fantastic job. The cats are so so happy there.  I have to admit that moving house can be quite challenging. It's easy to feel isolated and alone in a new town. My partner works in Sydney all week and I only see him at weekends. So I am starting to make an effort to get to know some people in the area. I am going to put my name down for some casual teaching, do some volunteer work, etc. I am doing a post breast surgery exercise class and have met some nice women there. I have some lovely neighbours who have made me feel very welcome but I still feel a bit alone sometimes. It's time to wake up my SO - he is such a sleeper-inner! There is a lot of work to be done today and then we have to drive back to the mountains. Love to all of you - not just the ones I have mentioned here! Jane xoxx ",

I would absolutely adore to meet you and everyone else. If I win the lottery I will be over quick smart, then, after we've spent a riotous time getting to know each other I'll check into that wonderful reconstruction clinic (It think it's in New Orleans?) for a state-of-the-art recon and I'll pay for anyone else who wants to go with me!). Lol! And pigs might fly. The most I ever won was $15 from a scratchie! I am booked to fly to Brisbane to stay with my sister and visit my mother (who is in an aged care facility) in two weeks. She will soon be 92 and she is not well lately. The year she turned 90 she developed epilepsy and today she had two seizures. I may have to cancel my booked flight and go earlier. Leesa, I loved hearing about your pet fish! How wonderful that he knows your voice and gets a 'rub' from you, the dear little thing. One of the cute things Blossom does...my house is on two levels and there are glass doors just at the foot of the stairs that I leave open for her to come and go as she wants. If she can't see me when she comes inside, she gives a little trill which sounds as though it has a question mark at the end. (translation: \"where are you - upstairs or down?\" I trill back to her and she comes leaping up the stairs or into one of the lower rooms, 'talking' all the way. I do love that cat!

In fact I heard on the radio this morning that a place in the west of my state is going to be the hottest place in the whole world today - 47C - that's nearly 117 degrees fahenheit! I'm glad I'm not there... It's mid- 30s here. I am longing for the cool of autumn - and fall is a very appropriate term as there are lots of exotic deciduous trees here - maples, elms, oaks, ash, etc I live on the edge of two towns here - it takes me about 12 minutes to walk to one and 15 minutes to the other one. It's great exercise as the streets are very steep. In this weather though, it is hard to walk anywhere! Karen, I had private tutors for my eldest son for his final year of high school but nothing worked! He preferred to socialise - his results were not great! However, he has gone on to do quite well so there is still plenty of hope. I hate the way your ex spoke to her about you though - what a beast! Judie - so great to hear you sound better! I love your description of the towhee's call - her sweet and cheerful! AE, I keep looking at those crazy happy dancers and it makes me laugh every time - so funny!  If I scroll back to comment on everyone else's posts I might lose this. Love to everyone, Jane xxx ",

I'm so glad that you and the others here still have jobs. I pray that you will keep your job and I'm glad there is that possible option with your sister. It's understandable that you feel homeless - you need your own place but I am glad you aren't living alone - kind of a catch 22 situation. I lived with other families for 2 years a few years ago and I longed to get back to my own place again. I'm so happy your results were all benign.  AE, it's over, thank God. I wish you didn't have to wait so long for the results - any time is too long and the time drags and your imagination runs away. It's sure to all be benign. So glad that Delbert is doing well. Lisa - also happy that Oliver is also doing well. He will be sooo happy to see you when you go to bring him home! Karen - can't wait to see you pics of the new 'do'. I bet you look beautiful! Nancy and Cathi - I hope your sinuses dry up soon and that you have a cold-free time for the rest of winter and spring. So sad about that poor woman being killed after already fighting her other battle and the 17 year old - what a dreadful thing. Praying that you will all be safe over these holidays. Judie - I wish I could help you move. How exhausting to have to do it all again after such a short time but this apartment will probably be better. I hope you can rest soon and that you feel stronger soon. It must be so hard doing this with lowered energy.  Sue - thinking of you in the leadup to your mammogram - I hate the darned things! How long does it take to get the results? Quickly I hope but nothing like that seems to be quick enough.  My youngest son returns home from overseas today. I haven't seen him for over a year so I am very excited. My middle son is leaving for Bali for a month about 2 hours after Will flies in so  that is a bit of a shame. I will be so glad when he returns safely as there is a high terrorist warning for Indonesia and Bali.  Love and hugs to you all and everyone I haven't mentioned. Jane xxx ",

Cathi - those are the cutest pups! I have always had a preference for black and white animals (even though I have owned all different colours & my current cat is grey/multicoloured). I wonder if Blossom would cope with a chihuahua? She thinks she's a dog anyway and loathes other cats. When I dropped her off at the cattery the other day, I was just about to leave when I heard this glutteral roar - it was Bloss growling at another cat! She normally has a very high-pitched, feminine voice but this was like a werewolf! Scary... Shirlann, the turducken sounds amazing. I laughed out loud when I read Walt's comment about the ant - he is so funny! I found my son's old laptop he left here so I am connected!

I have always been the \"pet getter\", so it just seems that I'm the one who always scrubs out their food & drink bowls, keeps their food & water fresh, takes them for walks (dogs, although I had a cat once who used to love to come for walks when we lived on a farm) etc but I reap the benefits of getting the most love back from them! Debbie, what type of dog do you have? Any chance of you posting some pics? We always love to see photos of fur babies here. Judie, the area in which you live sounds so culturally rich and exciting. I love that you you have art galleries within walking distance. I started an 8 week art course yesterday. It was so enjoyable! There are about 10 in the class - and one sweet dog, who slept under a table for two hours. The others in the class seem so nice, the teacher is an accomplished artist and I feel so inspired already. I came home and drew pictures for the rest of the afternoon. For homework, he wants us to draw without looking at the page, to free the creative parts of our brains and, although it's a bit daunting to begin with, I am loving it. Sue, I hope your nasty flu is getting better. Late winter is the worst time for these horrible bugs. I sometimes think I have escaped them but then, right at the end of winter, or Spring, wham - I go down. Lisa, I wonder if you could scan a pic of the scrapbook you are doing? Would love to see your handiwork.  It has rained here for days - such a welcome relief from the extreme heat of a week ago. People are walking around with their faces up to the rain, smiling! I hope it drenches the fire zone down south and puts out every last ember.  Tomorrow I am flying to Brisbane for a few days to stay with my sweet sister & to spend some time with my dear little mother. She is frail and very old and we don't know how long she has left. I love to sit next to her and stroke her soft white hair and hold her beautiful hands. She hates her hands - they are sinewy, with prominent veins and tendons but I have always thought they were beautiful. If she will let me, I am going to try to draw them. They say so much about her life of hard work and experience.  Love to all my sweet sisters and UB, Jane xxx ",

You are going to need lots of support during the waiting. Yes, left breast is more common for bc (mine was left) but, as Cathi has said, the overwelming majority are benign. Try to cling to that and believe that yours will be too. If it isn't, we will all put our arms around you and help your through.

A friend just sent me a recipe for a Tequila Christmas Cake: 1 cup of water 1 tsp baking soda 1 cup of sugar 1 tsp salt 1 cup of brown sugar Lemon juice 4 large eggs Nuts 1 bottle tequila 2 cups of dried fruit Sample the tequila to check quality. Take a large bowl, check the tequila again. To be sure it is of the highest quality, pour one level cup and drink. Repeat. Turn on the electric mixer. Beat one cup of butter in a large fluffy bowl. Add one teaspoon of sugar. Beat again. At this point it's best to make sure the tequila is still OK. Try another cup... just in case. Turn off the mixerer thingy. Break 2 leggs and add to the bowl and chuck in the cup of dried fruit. Pick the fruit up off floor. Mix on the turner. If the fried druit gets stuck in the beaterers just pry it loose with a drewscriver. Sample the lequita to check for tonsisticity. Next, sift two cups of salt. Or something. Check the tequila. Now shift the lemon juice and strain your nuts. Add one table. Add a spoon of sugar, or somefink. Whatever you can find. Greash the oven. Turn the cake tin 360 degrees and  try not to fall over. Don't forget to beat off the turner. Finally, throw the bowl through the window. Finish the tequila and wipe counter with the cat. CHERRY MISTMAS!  ",

It doesn't cure the cystitis (you usually need antibiotics for that) but if you drink it regularly it prevents bacteria from getting a foothold in the urinary tract. Not sure about the conjunctivitis - you may be ablee to get an over-the-counter medication. I wonder if regular eye baths would help to prevent it? You have to be careful not to dry your eyes out too much though. Hope you feel better soon.  Love to all, Jane xxx   ",

England is freezing, ditto the US and the north of Australia (Queensland) has terrible floods - two thirds of Qld has been declared a disaster area. And it's even cold in Florida? Crazy weather! Sheila - great idea re the map with the markers. Ooooh, I wish I could come to! But the thought of you all getting together is so wonderful - I hope you all post lots of pics so I can imagine being there. Fumi? I hope you will come back here when you have had a break!  Sue - I think maps should be clearer! I tend to get lost in big shopping malls because they all look the same. I also have difficulty relocating my car in multi level car parks.

UV antibiotics work so much more quickly. I'm sure you are so sick of hospitals and I agree there's no place like home but it would be good to hit this with the big guns. Having a chest cough as well must be making you feel so low. You poor thing - keeping you in my prayers that you start to feel better soon. Sheila - good to see you back again. I remember that dear, sweet Penelope was our Toto! Well, I think we should have multiple Totos - you can never have enough dogs! They are all wonderful creatures - big and small. Btw, your quilt sounds gorgeous. Will look forward to a pic! Cathi - no wonder you are angry! All that waiting, only to be told to wait some more - it's just too much! Keeping you and Jaclyn in my thoughts and prayers. AE - thinking and praying for you and UB as he starts his next chemo. Stinking, rotten bootface. My sister's best friend who is the same age as I am, has just been dx with NH lymphoma. She is such a lovely, vibrant fit and healthy person. I hate bootface! We need one of Sue's rants. Speaking of Sue, she seems to be really getting on with her life, getting fit and not focusing on this beast. Good for you Sue! And don't feel guilty about not checking in so much. We miss you here but you have to do what is best for you. Karen - so glad that Chase is better. Now you can go and enjoy this fantastic trip. You so deserve it! Lisa - great to hear from you. Love your attitude re the dating - just enjoying it and who knows what might happen? Lucky men to date the vibrant Lisa! What a sweet and generous boyfriend your daughter has - she needs to hang on to him! The concert sounds wonderful! Hugs to all xxxxx ",

It's sure to be a case of your lymph system fighting off infection because you work so hard. Also, it could be a bit of lymphoedema due to all this hard work.

I think survival starts from the day of diagnosis. Sheila - that's a nice idea you and your friends have about celebrating your new lives. Now, that would make me sound so much younger - I like it! I am so sorry to hear that you MIL is having problems after surgery and I pray that the docs will be able to fix her up very soon. It's very sad about the mean behaviour of your SILs - it's very like Cinderella. I hope they wake up to themselves.

Janet - hi and congrats on one year of new life. Sorry it's been a hard week for you - yes, it can take a long time to accept that this has happend.

Please give my best wishes to UB - hope he's doing well. Lisa, when you have your final tattoo, you will feel beautiful from head to toe (you already are but it will be like having beautiful underwear on that only you know you are wearing...and maybe somebody special...ha!). Sue, if you go to the doctor on your day off, you might just escape AE's flying monkeys! I hope you have made an appointment!! The bun fight sounds like it was fun...but no more excuses! Makraz, gerbills are cute but I have never owned on so I can't really say if they would make good pets. I had neighbours last year who had ferrets living in their house and their kids smelled so strongly of ferrets that I had to secretly hold my nose if they got close to me - what a pong!  Ullllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaa - ullll la la! That sounds a bit French n'est ce pas? So good to see you back! Hope you have been busy enjoying life. I can understand why you wanted to have a break though. Come back whenever you want to. Must go and do some shopping. Sweet dreams to all those north of the equator! And love to all. Jane oxoxox  Mel - as always, you put a smile on my face.

You were seeing so much more of him and now that together time as been reduced - a lot by the sound of it. No wonder you miss him. Every relationship is different and people vary enormously in how much time they need to spend together. Some people don't mind having long periods of time where they don't see their spouses/partners but I would say that these would be in the minority. I only see my partner at weekends as he works and lives in Sydney during the week. I do keep reasonably busy but sometimes it's really hard and it's then that I think that it doesn't do our relationship any good. Sorry, I don't have any suggestions. I guess he feels that he is being careful in these economic times but there needs to be a balance. He may feel that he is showing his love for you by working overtime. I'm sure the others will have some suggestions. ",

Judie - what a great jumper - you are so mulit-talented! And Connor is such a beautiful child. I think knitting is relaxing. I'm not a good knitter but I find it soothing. Karen - you are doing so well with your diet - good for you. Hope you and your mother were able to comfort and cheer each other. Shirlann - I hope the PT helps your sore hip. It sounds very uncomfortable. That is great that Walt's scan was clear. Lisa - I really like the sound of Michael. Were you able to meet him? Can't wait to hear more!  Leesa - that sounds so interesting about the PMT.

Karen - typical comment from someone who doesn't get it, as Cathi said. Still, it hurts. Even though I had DCIS, I still wonder at aches, pains and twinges - I must be a \"hyperchondriac\" too. I think we all feel this way - I guess time will ease these concerns somewhat. Lisa - if Michael misses out on getting to know and appreciate you then I just feel sorry for him too.

The day before my mastectomy, my clueless brother & his wife sent me a whole lot of rubbish about alternative bc treatments, telling me not to have a mastectomy. It was not the sort of thing I needed to be confronted with as I was psyching myself up for surgery. Judie - when I came home with my first mastectomy bra and prosthesis, my youngest son put it on and paraded around the kitchen. He is such a masculine type and it was so funny to see his antics!

I hope you don't get too exhausted dear Sue. We will wait to hear from you in the next few days. Ulla, I feel like the other ladies. Once your family gets over the shock, they will shower you with love and support. I think they will be a big comfort to you and you won't feel so alone. Yes, I have doctors in my extended family and a couple of them are soooo arrogant! But some are not so I don't want to sound prejudiced. I am so glad you are feeling a bit better about everything. I feel for your dh too - I'm sure he didn't mean to spill the beans but I think that, in the long run, he did the right thing - for everyone. You were so sensitive and kind to want to spare your family these worries about you but, as a mother, I would want to know what my child was going through - no matter how much of a worry it was. Big hugs to you darling Ulla. I have a cute animal story. Yesterday, my son was driving to work along a busy road when a swamp wallaby (a small, kangaroo-type of animal) jumped across the road in front of his car and got stuck in a fence. He stopped the car and a man in one of the houses ran out with a towel. They were going to put the towel over the wallaby and try to free it but before they could do that, it freed itself and hopped away. Then they saw a tiny baby joey (young wallaby) curled up in the grass on the other side of the fence. (Mother kangaroos and wallabies throw their babies out of their pouches when they feel in danger and the babies curl up and wait for their mothers who return to pick them up when the danger has passed). Anyway, it was highly unlikely that the mother would return because this was on a busy road, in the middle of suburbia and their was a dog in the yard who was showing a bit to much interest in the baby (luckily the dog was old and blind so it didn't find the baby - maybe no sense of smell as well?!) Heath wrapped the joey in the towel and brought him home to me. I don't think I have ever seen such a perfect little creature. He was the size of a kitten with light grey fur and huge dark eyes. I rang the wildlife people and they sent one of their carers around to collect him. She was such a sweet woman and has such a lot of experience in rearing native animals. She told me she has 11 joeys and 6 little wombats at the moment so 'our' joey will be in good hands.  While I was waiting for the wildlife woman to arrive, I sat in my loungeroom and cuddled the little darling to keep him warm. Heath took some photos so I will try to post them here later. I get a lovely warm feeling when I look at the pictures - he was such a sweet little thing. Love to everyone. I have an appointment so have to rush. Jane xxx ",

For the first few days, I was getting updates from her d/h and he was very low-key about it (that's his personality). Then, yesterday I spoke to her for the first time and she told me that she has had a high temperature all week and has had a stent put in. She has a blood infection called urosepsis. I googled it and it can be life threatening. She won't be allowed home until her temperature stays down for 24 hours. We are very close. Sheila - I would love to see a photo of your hankerchief quilt. You are so talented! Love to everyone, Jane",

Also Nancy - I could just see the beautiful morning you described as you drove and yet, what a tragic day it turned out to be. How terrifying it must have been! And Ulla, it was also fascinating to read your post. How frightening it must have been to not be able to express your opinion! We take our freedoms for granted I think but also, as a result of anti-terrorist laws, we are not as free as we once were and that is sad because most people mean no harm and just want to live peacefully.  I remember where I was when JFK was killed - I was out with my parents, visiting with friends. I was very young - about 5? When I first heard about Diana I was digging in the vegetable garden (I lived on a small farm then) and when I first heard about 9/11 I had just woken up (about 2am) to do a half night shift. I switched on the tv and I thought it was a movie. It took a while to sink in that it had really happened. I went to work and everyone was stunned and talked about it all night. My boss had the radio on in her office and kept giving us updates. It was such a sad, dreadful time. Karen!! I am soooo happy that you have finished your rads! And I am so happy that you feel happy and relieved! I hope you get your energy back soon. Please don't push yourself before you are ready. Congratulations and lots of love to you. Sheila - the photo shoot sounds like a lot of fun. Can't wait to buy a calendar. I think it's a lovely, creative way to raise money for bc research. AE - my best thoughts and love to UB and his tx tomorrow. You are such a great couple.   Love to everyone, Jane xxx ",

Mmmm...have to be careful otherwise any Aussies reading this will think I am unpatriotic...My father was a WW2 veteran and he suffered terribly from depression (in those days they called it \"war neurosis\" - now it would be called post traumatic stress syndrome) and the aftermath of malaria. I was rather frightened of him and didn't understand him as a child. I do regret that we weren't closer. Ulla, my heart goes out to you as you have experienced war first hand and I can only imagine how terrifying and vile it must have been for you and your loved ones and all who experience it. Ulla and Lisa it's so heartwarming to hear about your hair growing back and how you are starting to feel more like your old selves. There's nothing like a visit to hairdresser - I love it - especially when they massage my scalp - devine! The sun is shining here after what seems like weeks of rain. I am going to have a cuppa and sit in it to get some vitamin D!  Love to everyone - great to hear from you Ann and Dawn!

Back to books - I read The Sound and the Fury (Faulkner) once and found it fascinating - so cleverly written. I read a range of books - a mixture of fiction & non-fiction. The Color of Water (James McBride), The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time (Mark Haddon), Fresh Milk: The Secret Life of Breasts (Fiona Giles), The Cloudspotter's Guide (Gavin Pretor-Pinney), Ridiculous Expectations (Merridy Eastman) and many more. Suebee, Suebee - where are you? How are you? Lisa - thinking of you at your doc's appointment. It will be good to have the all-clear again. Judie - I love using both oils and watercolours. I'm not very good but I think I have potential! I would love to join a painters' group when I move to the mountains. It is a very arty area - many artists and writers live there so I'm hoping for lots of inspiration. Last night when I was in the detention centre there was an artist there who comes in on a regular basis to paint with the boys and encourage them to express themselves with art. I noticed that one of the cells had some beautiful sketches on the walls. Must rush. Love to all! Jane xxx ",

It won't be long until you work as a dentist again - I wish you were my dentist! Karen, I'm sorry your father is not well but so glad that you are nearby and can help in this way. I'm sure it means a lot to your mother to know that she can have her hair done while you check in with your father. So many older people don't want to see doctors or bother anyone. It would be great if you could somehow get him to a doctor but I know hard hard it is. I hope your dear dad is feeling better soon. My mother is 91 and she is very frail, has early dementia and is not at all well. It's particularly hard on my sister as she lives nearby and visits her every day (she is in a nursing home now). She has frequent small strokes. Also she has had a couple of epileptic fits - I don't know why she has developed epilepsy so late in life... Kaloni - you are so very welcome here and are already a very valued part of this group. I really like what Nancy said about this group benefitting from 'new blood' - I totally agree! Please stay with us! And that goes for everyone else who has joined along the yellow brick road! Lisa - you poor thing! Such an easy thing to do when you are tired. You must have slept very well and I hope your day got better. I am quite excited about you and Mel meeting up - can't wait to hear about your own special Nordies at Noon!

I wonder if that is what made her so sick...? I wonder if extremes in these elements in your body can make you that sick? Nothing conclusive was ever found with my mum. Anyway, she recovered and even though she is a frail little thing now, she keeps on living... Really though, it's no quality of life and she has been wishing to die for some years now. She used to say she was tired of living and would like to be at peace. \"I wish the Lord would take me\" she used to say when she lived with me.

You must be crowded when everyone comes to stay! I have a small house but there is a flat out the back which increases the number of rooms. The yard is too big for me now and I'm looking forward to downsizing. Shirlann - your photos are great! Imagine getting that close to a whale - I would adore patting one. Lasst winter we went whale watching and I was so excited - one of the best experiences I have ever had. A whale (a humpback) breached twice in front of our boat. It was exhilarating!  Hi also to Sue, Melody, Wren, Karen, Lisa, AE & UB, Mia, Dawn, Ann, Sheila, Judie, Jule, Ulla, Valsul and everybody. Love to all Jane xxx ",

Well, I hope you had a wonderful day and I'm sending you my very warmest, belated birthday hugs. ((((()))))! ((((Mel)))) - is it your birthday too? Is it today? - Monday, 9th June? If it is, I hope you have a wonderful day. (((((Big hugs to you too)))))! I must do you SexintheCity quiz. It's my oldest niece's 36th birthday today, my youngest niece's tomorrow (25th) and my mother will turn 91 on the 19th June.   Sue - I am so sorry to hear that you are in such a swollen, painful state. I can't add anything to AE's extensive list of do's & don'ts. I do know that if you catch LE early, get treatment - massages, instructions on how to wrap your arm when it swells, a properly fitted compression sleeve, and are careful, you can minimise its develpment and keep it at a comfortable level. I so hope you can get some treatment from a person who really knows what she/he is doing - soon! Gentle hugs to you - I wish I could help you - being so far away...I feel useless... Ulla - big, gentle hugs to you. I think it is not at all unusual to be feeling down like this after treatment. Are you on any antidepressants? I think it would be such a good idea for you to have them to get you over this part of your recovery. The Tamoxifen probably isn't helping either. I have heard taht the initial side effects tend to fade but you shouldn't have to suffer them cold turkey in the meantime. I wish I was with you to give you a hug and just sit beside you.  Lisa - Sex and the City opened here last week. I don't know if I will get to see it for a while... Hope you have a fantastic time dressing up in your sexy clothes and going out with your gfs to see it - have a fantastic time! Wren, I am sending you my most strengthening, loving vibes and hugs for a fantastic outcome for your surgery. How are you feeling - a mixture I suppose - scared, excited, happy...? Karen - I would like to send you some lovely warm sunny weather but it's the opposite of that here! It's been raining ever since June 1! The mountains were cold, misty and raining - but very atmospheric - I love the mysterious, mossy beauty of the mountains in that sort of weather. I planted my  purple garlic plants and they seemed to be very happy. I don't do humid well either - partly why I am moving to a cooler region. I loved your post about dogs - really fascinating. They are such wonderful animals. Nancy - sounds like you had a great weekend. The water in your brother's pool is sure to be warm enough for a dip soon! Jule - I absolutely loved hearing about your roses. They are my favourite flower. I prefer the heavily scented ones - all colours, so long as I can inhale that wonderful smell! What colour is the Stirling Silver - pale mauve-blue perhaps? Judie - wild yellow roses with a heavenly scent - oooh yes! AnneW - late springtime in the foothills of the Rockies...I can't think of a better place to be! I bet those tender spring lettuce will taste great! That is so great that you are back in the climbing gym already! Shirlann - great to see your post. As usual, your calm wisdom is a soothing balm. All of you - big hugs and love and also to Angie, Mia, Sheila, Kaloni, AnnNYC, Lucy, UB and anyone I haven't directly spoken to. Jane xxx ",

She must have been such a lovely person and this shows through in Jen's words - she sounds very much like her dear mother.  Judie - it's so exciting about your move downtown. The library sounds fantastic! The art gallery also sounds wonderful. I can't wait to hear more and maybe see some pics! Nancy - loved hearing about your garage sale and your bossy brother - it did make me laugh! I am sure it wasn't so funny at the time - brothers can be infuriating! At least you can live with yours - my brother and I are such opposites, that it would never work! Ann - your week of camping and hiking sounds so great - what a wonderful interest to share with your husband. Sue - I love your table - it looks so professional - you clever cookie! I hope I can do justice to mine. I hope the sun is shining again where you are. Karen - doing the walk and staying up all night - wow! I hope you had a good sleep and are feeling good again. I love the photo of Portia and her friend. She is so pretty - lovely smile like her sweet mother. Jule, I am sorry that you are sad but glad that you have been busy as it helps to get you through. The wedding cake sounds great - any pics? I would love to see it.  Suebee - I am thinking of you. By the time you read this your sugeries will be over. Praying it all goes well for you. .The sun is shining so I am planning to do some painting on the outside of the house today. Somebody here (Ithink it was you AE) asked if it was cold here. We've had a very mild start to winter. The silly mulberry tree has started getting fresh green leaves and flowering! However, the last few days, the rain has cleared up and the winds are from the south (cold!) so it is a bit chilly now - especially at night - I think we will get frosts soon. The mulberry will be shocked! Well, must tip the warm purring kitten (I think I will call him Klaus or Claws) off my lap and get to work with my paintbrush.

I'm very glad you have your dh home to support you through these dilemmas and decisions. And you have all of us who love and support you! I think it's great that you are shopping and buying yourself pretty things and I love the way your dh doesn't grumble about it! Shirlann - you are so reassuring and it's heart warming to know that your rebel son is now a great parent and citizen. If only we could know that they will turn out alright when we are lying in bed in the small hours, straining our ears to hear them arrive home!  Lisa - lol! I had to laugh when you wanted to know if my son on the far left is my oldest! That's Will - he's my youngest! He's only 23! All his wild living must be catching up with him! Tell Olivia that if you burn the candle at both ends it ages you prematurely! As far as I know he's a lot more sensible now. Youngest children...mmmm - they can really give you a shock! My first two were pretty normal - no major problems (apart from a car accident - no serious injuries thank goodness) so I was rudely awakened when my sweet baby became a beer-swilling, pot-smoking, girl-crazy teen! He was the life of the party and everybody's mate. How he got through high school and passed his final exams I do not know. I was unprepared and I don't think I handled things well at all. It sure would have helped to have had the support of this father but I think he actually encouraged it by giving him alcohol when he was way too young. I think he's a lot more sensible now so please be comforted by that! They rebel but they usually reform-eventually!  The son next to Will is my eldest, James (29) and Heath (26) is the one with the hair on his face. James was dating a Polish dancer the last time I heard, Will has broken up with his sweet girlfriend and Heath is seeing a few girls but is not in a relationship at the moment. I would so love to see them all happily partnered one day! This has taken me forever to write - too many distractions... Love to you all, Jane xxx ",

I would imagine it would be better to say that she's doing ok so as to save him going through fresh, raw grief each time. That's just my opinion and it may not be appropriate in this situation. Lisa - the party sounds fabulous. Would love to come! Love to everyone, Jane xoxo",

Even if your feelings don't match his at this stage, it's a great boost to know that somebody nice likes you. Wow Judie - you have done so well to move this quickly! I know you still have the big stuff to move...but hey - you have really worked hard. I love the sound of church bells! (((Nancy))) - I know you are in hospital but I just wanted to you to know that I am thinking of you and praying that you have a very successful surgery and don't feel too bad afterwards. Looking forward to hearing from you.  Today I have been ruthlessly cleaning out my bookcase, packing up the books I want to keep and forcing myself to donate others to charity. There is so much to do! I must think of Judie and get inspired.  Beth - hi! Nice to hear from you. Hi to all of my sweet sisters. Must get back to my packing. Love, Jane xxx ",

It was such a relief to have mine removed. I hope you are getting lots of rest. Thanks for the potato recipe - I am mystified as to how the potatoes don't taste too salty! Ulla - so great to hear from you too. It's so hard not to think the worst but try not to put yourself though more worry. The tests are sure to be negative! Big hugs to you and please remember that we all think of you. Sue - I know you are flat out and probably exhausted - I think of you each day and hope and pray that you are coping. You are so good at coping but please don't overdo it! Judie - you are quick compared to me! My problem is that I have so much of my sons' stuff here and I am trying to sort through it, guessing as to whether things should be kept or thrown out. I plan to put all their things in one room and then rent the rest of the house. Shirlann - that is a great idea to sell the books on Amazon. Trouble is, postage is so expensive...I might try to have a garage sale first and see how that goes. I would hate to have to wait for my mammo results. Perhaps I have just been lucky but I've never had to wait for more than a few minutes to get them. The technician always leaves the room to show the film to the radiologist, comes back and either tells me to get dressed (all is clear) or that they have to do more tests. Karen and Sheila - there are so many things to consider. Estrogen is good for bones, libido and general well being but hormone positive bc...not good at all. It's a real dilemma.

I know it sounds harsh to call my neighbours stupid but if I wrote of all the neglect and ill treatment that they have inflicted (and continue to inflict) upon their poor, unfortunate animals it would take up pages. They had a little Shetland pony for years. They never had any grass for him (this is a suburban back yard and can't possibly support a pony) so I would often have him in my yard. I also bought him horse food when I could afford it. A horse needs supplementary feed even if it has plenty of grass. Well, due to their refusal to feed or get vet treatment for him, he died an agonising death from colic a couple of months ago. Anothoer couple I know paid to have all their cats and dogs desexed but they just keep getting more animals - and neglecting them! I don't understand them - I think it's a type of mental illness. Possum soon realised that she liked the food, cuddles and love I had to offer her. I'm just glad that I made her short life happy in the time that I had her. AE - I am so glad that Bill's counts were normal but I can imagine how you feel after past experience. I'm praying that his thyroid test and CAT scan comes back clear. Fumi - I read your guy's story.

You've aready experienced the top  three, haven't you? And now this! You must rest. Take Agnes to bed with you and listen to her purr, play yourself some soothing music and light some candles. I am sending you soothing energies and prayers that you will let everything go until you have rested. Wren, you will get there. It sounds as though you are being sensible and doing it slowly. The last time I moved house I was working night shift at a factory. I just bundled everything into garbage bags, threw them into the rent-a-truck and my kids loaded the heavier stuff. I was in a daze of tiredness. Then I left my factory job and went back to full-time study - I don't think I every had time to get organised! So you are doing really well. It's so good to hear that you are happy in your dear little house. Karen - where are you? Are you ok? Haven't heard from you for a while, sweet sister. Please check in and let us know how you are.

After 2 weeks of men-at-work traipsing through my house and me not doing much cleaning, it was high time to get to work with the broom and mop. Sue - I so love the photos of you in your ruby shoes - you look so pretty! How on earth do you eat so much and remain so lovely and slim?! The shoes really suit you! Hope you had a good rest before starting work again and that you start to feel more energy soon. Oh Melody -  what beautiful furbabies! I can see that Lilly is starting to accept Sweetpea - in spite of her high octane energy! So happy to hear that you had a buzzing good time - that would have done you good! Sorry to hear you lost money but sounds as though it was a blast doing it! I have had next door's Charlie in each morning. He is about 3 months old, a tabby and sooo affectionate. This morning I gave him something to eat (my neighbours, you might remember, never look after their animals) and then he curled up on my lap in front of the heater with his two front paws wrapped around my wrist - so cute! I am very tempted to catnap him when I leave here... Ulla - I love your photos too! You do look lovely - healthy, pretty and happy. I would love to see those old Swedish houses - I love the last one too - what a beautiful fireplace!  Lisa - I'm sure Danni will have a wonderful time but I know how you feel, seeing her fly off to another country. I hope she gets first class on the way home. I cried when my boys flew away but at the same time I was glad they were adventuring. Isn't it great how you can track the plane? And the price - wow!! What an opportunity for her! Tell her to call in on James & Will in London! Karen - hope you are having a good weekend and that your dad is continuing to improve. I agree with Lisa - we remember our parents when they were younger and it's so hard to see them get sick and old. My mum doesn't even know who I am any more... Love to everyone I've mentioned and everyone I haven't. Love you all and hope you are all having a few happy moments. I do feel for those of you who are facing and having surgery and treatments.

Ulla - I will miss you here but anything is worth a try to help you get through this depression. I hope you can find things to uplift and cheer you. Just know that you are very loved and appreciated here. Kaloni - haven't heard from you for a while...how are you doing? Hugs. Big loves to everyone. Jane xxx ",

Sheila, not all doctors are open to the whole LE thing - especially after SNB. Yet, nearly all the women from my support group have had at least a few symptoms - from a tingling, heavy feeling to obvious swelling. I overdid things over Easter - scrubbing down walls and painting and my arm has been playing up ever since. I hope your arm is feeling better. Have you made an appointment with the LE specialist? Even if the swelling has gone down it would be a good idea to go and get baseline measurements. Nettie - how are you feeling? Cheryl - hope you are feeling better. Fumi - miss you around here! Shirlann - where does the time go? Appliances and home maintenance - the first never lasts and the second is never finished!

As somebody said - it's hard to know who is the cuter! No wonder you are confused by the contradictory statements about Jaclyn's condition. This would make it so much harder - the waiting and the confusing info. I pray that you get a definite plan going soon. Karen - hope you are feeling a little better and pray that your results will be good. As far as the whole foob/swimwear/clothing thing is concerned. I think I look really peculiar in bras (mastectomy) now. I wish I could still wear my pretty ones but they wouldn't look the same even if I sewed a pocket in them. I donated all my pre-bc ones to a man who is planning to string a world record number of bras on a line to raise money for bc research. A year or so ago, a poster on these boards gave a link to a range of clothes (I think it was New York based?) for single mastectomy women who didn't want to wear a prosthesis and wanted to look fashionable. The clothes were beautiful! And quite expensive. I wish I could remember the website - it might be possible to google it up. I have visitors for the weekend - must stop and make some hot soup to warm them up when they get back from their walk. Love to all, Jane xxx",

I love Henk Guth's paintings. He has such and interesting life too. I know what you mean about the happiness of being imersed in art. When I was doing it at college, it was so great! Sometimes frustrating and hard work but I remember one day when a couple of us went out with our art teacher to paint beside the sea and it was such a wonderful day. I leaned that there is nothing like being out in the elements to help you get the atomosphere into your painting. You need to get immersed again Judie - throw yourself in and revel in it! I want to jump in too! James & William (eldest & youngest sons) are in Norway and say the people are great there. They are currently at a music festival in Storaas. Heath (middle son) is flying off to meet them in about 2 weeks. James will probably go back to London before too long as he has a girlfriend there and work to do but I think Heath & William hope to visit Russia and eastern Europe. William plans to teach in the UK until the end of Novermber and then work on the ski fields in the US and Canada for a couple of months before flying home in January.

Hope you have a fantastic time - I'll bet Portia and Chase are looking forward to it. Thank you for your sweet and kind words - you are such a darling! Well, after walking the streets for hours this morning I finally bought my mother a gift for Mothers Day. It's hard to choose something for her now. I settled for some face cream and some chocolates. She has dry skin and has always gone to bed at night with her face smothered in moisturiser. When I was little, she used to use Ponds \"Cold Cream\" (I wonder if that was its real name or her term for it?). I'm sure that if I could smell it now, I would be transported back to being 4 or 5 again. I couldn't find the right card so I eventually made my own. A while ago I bought a packet of blank cards with a 'picture window' in each one for pasting a photo or drawing/painting your own picture. She has always loved little lambs so I drew one lying in green grass surrounded by flowers and used some watercolour pencils to brighten it up. I hope she likes it! Karen, I feel the same way about all the wonderful people here. I can't go for more than a day or so without at least stopping by to read. Fumi, come baaaaaack! I love your photos on facebook! xoxo",

His wife (the NZer) also seems to hate my boys and me so what a fun little social occasion that would be! LOL! It's so strange how people can simmer for decades and not put stuff behind them. My boys are very close to their two half brothers so it's not all bad, I guess. Lisa, disagreements with your kids can be very upsetting. One of my boys used be a bit prickly about things but seems to have mellowed a little now. Perhaps the dynamics with daughters are different? Issues or not, I commend you both (particularly you for your strength and understanding) for being able to talk it out - that shows balance and maturity. Elise will sort out whatever is worrying her and I'm glad she is open to counselling etc to help her. Can't wait to to pics of Olivia - what a beauty she is! AE, I have heard of Rodney Hall - which books of his have you not read? Just googled him - his latest book seems to be 'Love without Hope' (2007). Have you read that one? I'm afraid I haven't read any of his. I don't think I have ever read any murder mysteries...maybe I should! I rather like Tim Winton (Cloudstreet, Breath etc), Kate Grenville, Janette Turner Hospital and many more.  Judie, I hope you had a wonderful day with your two daughters. Sounds like just the sort of day I would love - my sister and I do that when we are together. My heart aches for your sadness.  What is the treatment for a ganglion? I heard that the old-fashioned treatment was to hit a ganglion with a big old family Bible - how dreadful! Why a Bible? Is this a myth? Why hit it? Has anyone else heard of this? Mel, I hope your back is improving. Are you having any physiotherapy or other treatment for it? Gentle hugs to you, sweet one. Karen - how was your weekend? Hope it was great! Sue - did you have Sunday off? Hope you were able to convince your sons that it was Mother's Day - again! I read yesterday that you have your MD in March. UB - you are pulling our legs!

When I am super stressed I can't eat - divorce, teaching, bootface dx all saw me lose lots of weight. Judie - big hugs to you. I hate that you have this worry at the moment. Nothing will make you feel better than to hear that everything is benign and I hope it is much sooner than you expect. I love the photos of Connor - look at that concentration on his face! Sue, poor darling. Periods used to make me feel so exhausted so I can imagine how hard it is for you to keep working and caring for your boys. Shirlann is right though - the silver lining can be great sex! For a full year after my mx I had hot flashes and hardly any periods (and I haven't even been on hormone treatments) but now they have come back - lighter but regular. Shirlann - love that pic of your beautiful grandaughter. Thank you for all your wise and comforting words - you are so precious to us.  Wishing everyone some happy times this weekend, Love, Jane xxx ",

I am wondering if ultrasound and/or MRI would be better than mammo for her as she is likely to have quite dense breasts at her age? She is also too young to have to worry about all this cr%#p but it's best that she is pro-active. Hugs to you all",

My mother is now back in her nursing home and my sister is resting at home - they were both released from hospital yesterday. The doctors at the hospital said that mum has either uterine, ovarian or some sort of intestinal cancer but that, at her age and her being so fragile, they do not want to do any invasive tests. So they are going to manage any pain and keep her as comfortable as possible.They said she might have 3 weeks or 3 months. Looking back, she had symptoms several years ago when she was living with me but refused to have any tests so I think she has probably known about this for some time. At the moment she is comfortable and eating reasonably well.  Love to all, Jane xoxox",

I love your carefree attitude - I'm sure that makes you even more attractive to men. Enjoy this time - it's exciting and for all of us quite vicarious! I hope you find a great dress for the beautiful Olivia (although I have to agree with Mel - she would look good in anything!). I have been listening to interviews with those two men who raised Christian the lion in London in the 60's. They are launching their book about it. I love the footage on youtube of them meeting up with him in Africa long after he had been released - very moving. Mel - I love what you said to Karen. You are such a wise and loving soul. Now, about the issues you raise. I am still pre-menopausal too - at 52. My cycles have been all over the place the last 2 years, with periods often lasting up to a month and even 6 weeks on one or two occasions. Hot flashes have come and gone over the years but I haven't had one for about 6 months but my periods are still reasonably regular. My DCIS was strongly ER+ but my surgeon has never mentioned tamoxifen. I too have put on weight since my dx and I am aware that will increase my estrogen levels. It's so hard to get into a motivated mind-set to eat the right amounts of healthy food and to exercise - particularly when you are unsettled and stressed. I also had a skin-saving mastectomy as it all happened so quickly and I knew nothing about reconstruction and none of my medical people really wanted to discuss it! My DCIS was grades 2 & 3 and all through my breast including in my nipple. A year after the mx, I had a digital mammogram and they mammo-ed my scar and axilla. It sounds uncomfortable but it was quite easy and didn't hurt at all. I think I will opt for digital from now on. According to the final path report, they got clean margins.  Even though I had call-backs all through my 40s, when it happens now, I get scared. Mel, my goal is to start exercising more regularly and eating less. It's been hard here lately - cold, lots of rain and fog - not great for walking. The sun is out today and it has really lifted my spirits. I walked to town and it was really enjoyable to look at the beautiful autumn leaves and the blue sky. Everyone I met was happy and commenting on the great weather. It's not going to last for long though! I've made an appointment to see a doctor in Sydney who is also a natural therapist, counsellor etc so I hope her advice will help to motivate me! I'm still enjoying my art classes. This week we are concentrating on portraits so I'm going to have to insist on my friends & family sitting for me. Honestly, I'm not a great artist so I wouldn't be keen to put photos of my work on here but I do love to draw and paint - and write! I wish you lived closer Mel - I would love to get together for motivation sessions! Maybe we can try doing it in cyberspace!  Love to you and all the other wonderful women here and Bill (I hope you are doing ok - I can't remember how long your chemo will go for this time...). oxoxoxox ",

Yep, we are all there with Karen and her family in the motor home. Listen to the waves, smell that salt air...mmmm... feels like early summer. We celebrated Mothers Day early as all the restaurants are going to so crowded tomorrow and it's going to be cold and rainy. Today was the classic, perfect autumn day - blue skys, crisp air, the leaves breathtakingly bright and beautiful. Happy Mothers Day to everyone for tomorrow - hope you all have a wonderful day - including Sue - I think you have Mothering Sunday at a different time of the year but maybe you could convince the boys to make you breakfast in bed?!

My other 2 sons have told me she is beautiful but that she has a ferocious temper and is totally wrong for James. She has just arrived in Australia (her second trip here in the last few months) and they had a terribly fight. She is SO emotional - she said she wanted to kill James and that she was going to get on a plane straight away and fly to a tropical island off the Queensland coast. She was so nasty to him. She got as far as Sydney, rang him and apologised and now they are together again. It has been an on and off romance because they keep having disagreements, breaking up and making up. I wish they would break up for good and that he would find a less volcanic girl! She may be exciting now but would be hell to be married to!

I've had 2 out with a local and my youngest son had all his out a few years ago under local. The worst part is the pressure and all that tugging - the person doing the pulling has to brace him/herself and your head gets yanked back and forth - no wonder a face looks black and blue a couple of days afterwards. Neither my son nor I felt any pain during the surgeries but his were badly impacted and he needed a fair bit of pain relief afterwards. My best wishes to Portia for a quick recovery and minimal bruising. Cathi - you poor thing - all that sickness in your family! You are such an angel - running around after them. I do hope and pray that you stay well. I hope everyone feels a lot better - soon! Nancy -wishing your aunt a quick recovery. It's very hard to help someone who doesn't want to be helped. It's sweet of you to help her out and I hope she will relent and let the painters in but you can only do so much if she resists help. Also, you do have my sympathy re that work report. My math ability is abysmal.  Sheila - hope your LE remains under control during the warmer months. Judie - you have a lot on your plate. I wish you could get some help with that CD task. Sending you my very best wishes for successful surgery. Will that be the last recon surgery for a while? It will be so worth it. I get so sick of my prosthesis - it feels much heavier than my real breast! One day I'd love to have a proper bump there... My youngest son flew out to the US (New Orleans) last Sunday.

I think that the most difficult thing about marrying for the second time is the relationship between your kid/s and your partner. I don't envy step parents - it must be extremely difficult. Yet, as the mother, you feel protective of your child and the stress of trying to keep the peace. I pray that Portia and Rhuel can work this out. Also, I hope Portia is feeling betterr by now. Wecome back Barbe! Can't wait to see pics of the wedding. Glad you had a great time. Cathi - wow! You look gorgeous! I arrived home from visiting my sister & mum last night. I was able to help her (sister) with housework and cooking while she rested after her recent illness. We visited our mother each day. My mum was very weak and not eating most of the time while I was there but she has improved in the last few days. She is so thin - how can somebody continue to live in such a state? The doctor now thinks she may not have bootface - he thinks it might be a very large and rapidly growing ovarian cyst. At her age, they don't want to do invasive test/treatment to get an exact diagnosis. They are keeping her comfortable and she doe look very relaxed and peaceful. When asked if she is comfortble she replies that she is.  Love to everyone Jane xoxox",

I think there's too much pressure on truck drivers to meet deadlines. It must be a stressful job. Hugs. Shirlann - I'm so sorry to hear about Walt's trips to hospital.  It's horrible for you both. Hoping and praying that you have better times ahead. Lisa - It's so good that you and Tom were able to talk about things and sounds as though there will be more discussion to come - that's healthy and looks very hopeful. Poor man. That's rather typical of ex's generally I think. They don't want you but they don't want anyone else to want you and they want you to want them! Weird and complex! Oh, and re the house renovations - hrumph! is all I can say - still haven't finished them. My husband's workplace is understaffed and he can never seem to get more than a day's leave (apart from weekends). The last time he had a block of time of was 7 days in February 2009 so he's tired and stressed. Hopefully, he will have extra staff in the form of part timers in another month. I'm going to make him go on a camping trip with his mates before he does any work around the house. He needs to get away and chill out. Nettie - congratulations on the births of those two precious babies! I love the names too - so sweet. My very best wishes for things to go smoothly with your next procedure. Karen - how is Portia feeling after her extractions? When do you move into your new house? Cathi - hope you are all feeling better. How's little Ella? Love to you all Jane oxoxxox",

What a relief!  Karen - I can't wait for you to move in to your new house! I can imagine you out on the porch, relaxing - you deserve it after all these months of waiting.  Judie - I love the pic of Devin and Nettie - it's wonderful how they met up and became friends - all through bc.org! Good luck for your exchange surgery. Won't it be great to have that over - you're nearly there! Nancy - my best wishes for your surgery too! Wow - you will feel so good when it's done. I hope your aunt starts making some progress soon.  Nettie - I'm so glad the barium enema went well and I hope the Herceptin was uneventful. Prayers for little Amy - I hope her surgeries go smoothly. Cathi - I think you must be very busy with your family. Hope you are not wearing yourself down to a frazzle. Hi also to Barbe, Sheila and everyone else. I don't seem to get on here as much as I used to. I'm going to a birthday party tomorrow for one of my nephews (do you say \"great\" nephew? I think so as I'm his great aunt!) I must go and wrap his gift. He'll probably be more interested in eating the wrapping paper as he's only 1!  Jane oxoxoxo",

My doctor told me that I need to lose weight to get my oestrogen levels down and so hopefully, minimise any chance of developing bootface again. Linda, was it you who said you've visited Cape Cod lately? I've always wanted to travel to that part of the US - all that windswept coastline and beautiful houses! Nancy, I am thinking of you and your Dad. Praying that he will either rally or have a pain free end to his life.  It is just so hard to see your elderly parents suffer in any way.",

You & Jaclyn seem to have a high level of mutual respect for each other. Each of our children are different and our relationships with them are different. I do hate being made to feel guilty and, as a mother, it's far too easy for me to berate myself and blame myself for the shortcomings in my kids. There are no perfect parents but I guess we do the best we can. So far, I haven't acquired any daughters-in-law. I would love to have some but only if they and their husbands can have a reasonable level of contentment. Wild passion is one thing but kindness, respect, maturity, real, unselfish love on both sides...all too much to hope for I suppose...sigh! Hugs and love to all of you, Jane xxx",

Hey Sheila - why are you not considered cured? I was also told that I had about a 2% chance of recurrence but that I should consider myself cured. Maybe it's just how you phrase it - you have a 98% chance of it never coming back - sounds pretty good to me! I had an estrogen blood test a while ago and got the results today and it was good. Apparently there are 2 types of estrogen and one of them puts you at higher risk of recurrence if it is high. Thankfully, the \"bad\" one was low. My doctor is recommending that I have a D&C for a uterine fibroid which showed up on a pelvic ultrasound I had a couple of weeks ago. Seems a bit unnecessary to me. I'm hoping the gynecologist I'll be seeing will say it's all ok and I don't need to have it done. Since bc, I seem to have had so many tests! I'm over it - just wish I could go back to how it was - I hardly ever saw a doctor in the good ol' days.  Lisa - roll on Thursday! It's going to be a wonderful day for you.

LOVE all the \"potty-mouth\" stories - so funny! When my children were very young, we lived next door to some very conservative, disapproving people. They had children of their own but they weren't allowed to play with the other kids in the street. With maybe one exception (reversing into a street sign when my kids were in the car!) I haven't sworn in front of my kids. One day, we had just arrived home from church. My kids had been quite well behaved and a couple who had been sitting behind us had complimented me on their behaviour so I floated home, feeling like a virtuous parent. I started making lunch while the kids played outside. Then, to my horror, right outside the window of the neighbours, I heard my youngest (aged 4) yell at his elder brother: \"Get f#*@ed!\" I heard the neighbour's window slam down. They no doubt felt completely justified in not allowing their children to play on the street with the likes of mine.  Cathi, I feel for you re Ella and Landen's possible removable from your loving household. You and Ed have done a wonderful thing by looking after them and loving them so much - and to be there for all those precious milestones - no wonder your heart is torn. I'm sure that, no matter what the outcome, you have done a power of good in the lives of those two young ones. How many times have I read about the impact of having at least one, loving adult in the first year or so of life! It builds resilience and does things to a child's brain which gives them reserves to face difficulties in the future. You can't underestimate the good you have done. Judi, I'm so glad Connor didn't have to make that long journey by himself! Heck - it's hard enough for an adult to sit still for that long. Thank goondness for Devin - what a relief! Also, Judi, my middle son has been in Seattle quite a lot lately and loved it - the cafes, the coffee, the music and the people - one in particular! Towards the end of last year he met a girl from there who came out here to be bridesmaid for some friends of his (these friends had previously told him that he and Seattle girl would be a perfect match). Well, they really hit it off and there is talk of making things permanent - ie marriage. I wonder what the future holds. There will certainly be difficulties - distance, where to live, etc. Mustn't let my imagination run away with me. I do long to have some grandchildren. I realise that it isn't all plain sailing - there are always difficulties. My sister has an ex-d-i-l who has recently been diagnosed with leucaemia so my sister has taken over a lot of the daily care of her grandsons as well has doing a lot for their very sick mother. There is huge animosity between my nephew and his ex-wife - it's all such a mess... Karen, Lisa, Nettie, Sheila, Nancy, Barbe and everyone here - hugs and love to you all. Jane xoxoxox",

It''s just horrible waiting. I would feel like camping on the doctor's doorstep and storming in and demanding (nicely!) the full path report as soon as the place is open. I had a lumpectomy on a Tuesday and got the path report on Friday. Even though the result was that I had to be rescheduled for a mastectomy, it was a relief to get the report. Knowledge is power but it's also sanity saving. I woke up every night at 2 or 3am from the time I was diagnosed until I had the mastectomy - about 5 weeks. I lost my appetite too. Try to keep busy this weekend - outings with the kids, dvds, playing board games - whatever keeps your mind from going to dark places. Hugs, Jane xoxo",

In the whole scheme of things, my missing cat (she was barely 2 and very healthy) is way down on the list. I thought that from the time I first realised she was gone. Yes, she was a sweet little creature and I do miss her and I still hope nothing bad happened to her but bootface, worry about our loved ones and other things that life throws up are so much worse.

This afternoon I had a phone call from my neighbour in the mountains to say that they had found Blossom! Someone heard her piteous cries from under an old abandoned house and tried to get her out. I don't know all the details yet but they called the fire brigade and two trucks arrived and eventually they got her out! I am heading back there tomorrow to be reunited with her. She is staying at the vet's until I can pick her up. My neighbour said she looks well - must have been feasting on mice while she was imprisoned. I am amazed - I thought she was gone for ever!

I remember once reading an analogy: A man comes home to his wife with another woman on his arm and says to her \"Darling, I love you so much that I decided to get another wife to keep you company. I'm sure you'll be best of friends!\" That's how it feels for a young child when a sibling arrives. I'm so mad with your SIL for being so crass and brutal. Your loving, kind presence has no doubt calmed the poor little boy. I wonder if SIL has any comprehension that he has done a stupid, cruel thing?

Sue, before my early 40s I had never had a headache. In my early-mid 40s I started getting migraines. It felt like a axe was embedded in my head and, if I didn't quickly take medication (strong pain killer with added calmative), I would feel worse and worse until I threw up and then I would start to feel a bit better. If I took pills I would just sleep it off and wake up feeling a bit washed out. I don't know why I developed migraines then (maybe the beginning of perimenopause?). They gradually got less and less. The last one I had was about 2 years ago so I seem to have grown out of them thank goodness. I wish you could find a less stressful job. Cathi - I think you have the patience of Job! How do you manage not to openly react to your SIL? You are amazing! My sister is staying with her daughter & SIL in Canada to help after the birth of the latest baby (she's been there nearly 3.5 months). Her SIL is also an impossible man (abusive, dreadful temper and a real chauvinist). I don't know how she manages to not react to him. She said she often cries herself to sleep though - worrying about her daughter (who has had severe postnatal depression - not helped at all by his rages). Now they think my niece is pregnant again! How will she cope with 3 kids under the age off 3 with her fragile mental state and her horrible husband?  Oh, and I loved your reaction to those ignorant women in the salon! Lisa - I love to read about your happiness and I'm so glad that things are better with Olivia. Judie - please give Jasper a hug for me.  Sheila - hope you are feeling better. Karen -  I was so sad to read about your dh's nephew. Is he going to a mainstream prison? Will he get any help with his mental problems? What a dreadful start to life the poor boy has had. I'm not saying his crime should be ignored but he does need help along with his punishment. Now it's getting late and I have to pack and catch an early train.  Love to all of you I mentioned and everyone else. Jane xxxx",

Maybe it's just the change of seasons. We've been having very strong winds here. Lisa, please don't think the worst - Tony is probably just tired. Also, you two have been on such a high lately and it's not possible to maintain that level of euphoria for weeks on end. You have to come down eventually and it would be only natural for you to feel a bit \"flat\" when that happens. Love to all, Jane oxoxox",

Judie - what a fabulous cake!! Love the green scales and all the colour. Must have been such a hit with the kids. It's been a very busy week for me. My husband had to re-apply for his job (he's been in the same job for many, many years but apparently that is now almost frowned upon and not rewarded). The application had to be all done online, using all the pompous jargon that seems to have swamped the workplace these days (best practice, achieving outcomes, excellence, performance indicators, inclusivity, blah, blah, blah). You can talk about excellence and achievement until you are blue in the face but if you don't actually do it - what's the point?! Anyway, I initially typed out 10 pages in a word document, then he had to condense it into 3 main answers which took forever. I went to work with him each day and in between his many duties, we worked on the application. Then home to work on it until often 1am. The interview should be next week. It's demeaning that, even though he does his job so well and is well liked and respected, he has to go through this stressful process. There's always the worry that he will lose his job to a much younger person. Rant over. Love to all and also to Lisa, Sue, Mel, Shirlann, UB & AE and everyone here. Jane",

I too have been told I have a lot of stress there by massage therapists. My dentist confirms this by saying I grind my teeth at night and that makes my teeth sore!  I can't relate to the drippy sensation but I've heard of \"formication\" which feels like ants crawling under your skin. Barb - glad you had a massage but your therapist was very insensitive and downright annoying. Good comeback. I hate it when people try to pin some guilt on you about developing this disease. I think they're trying to reassure themselves that they are doing everything right and so don't think they will get it. Well, I hope they don't but I don't think anyone should be too cocky and smug about their health. I'm with my \"kids\" this weekend. They're helping with the renovations of my old house.

It sounds as though she is getting the best medical attention - even before she is born. I love the meaning of her name too. Sue, I wish the fortune tellers wouldn't talk about the future. It either raises false hopes or causes unnecessary worry. PatMom made some great points. Most of us will be coming into some sort of heritage as we grow older - it's a pretty safe prediction, most of us have some aching joints and the majority will be having something to do with a hospital in the future - we might break something, have to have routine tests, or procedures which shouldn't give much concern. Please try to put worrying thoughts out of your mind. I tried to talk my eldest son out of going to a fortune teller a few weeks ago. I don't think it helped him at all. Sheila - love the sound of your belly dancing/I Dream of Jeannie costume - you will look fantastic! Lisa - I'm still hoping that Tony is the one but I hate that you have these feelings of unease about him. I hope things can be worked out between you. I want you to have lots of love and security and nothing to fret about in your relationship. Karen, it's a dreary, rainy day here too. I am curled up in front of the fire.

Judie and  Meg, thanks for asking. The D&C went well yesterday. I had a great all woman team - a lovely gyno (I can imagine her singing sultry jazz ballads - she's gorgeous), an equally nice anaesthetist and sweet nurse. Everything went well. My gyn said that I had a thickening in my uterus that shouldn't be there and a fibroid. She mentioned the slight possibility of something sinister but I'm sure it's all fine. These minor things are very common at my age. I hope to get the path report before Christmas but I'm not at all worried. It's going to be a busy week as I make up for lost time. So much to do - so much food to prepare. I've always had quite simple Christmases but this year it's going to be a large gathering and I hope I can do it moderately well. The pressure is on! I do so want everyone to enjoy themselves. Love to everyone Jane xoxox",

I pray and hope that things will work out for the best - for Landon and Ella and for you and Ed - you are such amazing grandparents! It's heartbreaking to see kids have to go through all of this. We have a an organisation here - DOCS (Dept of Community Services) that deals with families under stress. They get a lot of negative press. I'm sure they must do some good but they are understaffed and the caseworkers burn out quickly when they have to deal with such tragic cases of abuse and neglect. You and Ed really really deserve a good nights sleep and several uninterrupted coffees.  I loved reading all the wise and loving advice from  Karen, Barbe, Dawn, EWB, Judie and everyone else. I've been getting some casual teacher support work the last couple of months. I help the special needs kids. The pay isn't as good but I prefer it to being in charge of the whole class. It can be pretty draining though. Just wanted to send lots of love and Christmas wishes to all of you. Jane xoxoxo",

Online discussions/comments are often so nasty because people feel anonymous. It's a bit like road rage - someone who is quite well-mannered in everyday life, gets into their car and then they have a personality change. Same with discussions on the internet - it's scary - so much hatred. I avoid discussing politics if I can. Argument rarely changes anyone's opinion - just causes bad feelings. Had my yearly visit to the breast centre last Friday for mammo and U/S. Got the all clear. I always say that I'm not worried but I think that I do get uptight about it because I slept very badly the night before. This time the U/S really hurt. The tech was pressing down hard on cysts. I flinched and she told me to stay still. I gritted my teeth and was much relieved when it was over. Does anybody else find U/S painful? I'm sure I must be in the minority. Anyway, that's the last time I will be going to that breast centre because it's too far away and I will be going to a closer centre for my next annual check. The new one probably won't give results while I'm there. It's so good not to have to wait days to get the all-clear. Judie - that's a great pic of Devin - he is such a handsome boy. Nettie - my best wishes for an uneventful surgery and a quick recovery. Also, I hope your sweet niece has a good labour and birth. I love the names Lily and Rose - I remember they were on my list of girls' names when I was pregant with each of my sons! Please give Whisper a gently pat from me. He sounds like such a sweet boy. Lisa - hope you have a fantastic time in Arizone with your sister. My sister is arriving on Thursday to stay with me for a few days. Haven't seen each other for nearly a year so I'm looking forward to seeing her - hugely!

I love reading everyones' posts - little snippets of life in far away places and yet we all live on a small planet and have such similar feelings about so many things. Ulla - there is so much life and energy in your posts - I love it when you drop in a Swedish word or two! Your links to those websites sound really interesting - must read them when I get a chance. Went fishing this morning with 2 of my sons. (Well, I watched and felt a bit sorry for the fish!) It was so much fun though and lots of laughter. They are leaving in about 3 weeks on a round the world holiday, the bulk of it being spent in the UK, working. I will miss them so much but I am so excited for them.  The Christmas card thing is such a lovely idea Sue! Where is this Christmas mailing list? On these boards? I will try to pm you Sue. We Australians are a funny lot. All our shopping centres and malls are decked out in raindeer, fake snow and figurines of rugged up people singing  carols - and yet most of us are sweltering in the summer heat! It's even funnier when we cook hot roasts, plum puddings and all the rest of the traditional Christmas fare - it makes our kitchens into saunas! A lot of us do have cool foods on Christmas day though - salads, pavlova, and icecream cakes. The beach or a pool is the best way to cool off after a big Christmas lunch.  And yet, I just love the idea of a snowy white Christmas so you can really enjoy all the traditional trimmings! Last year it snowed around Melbourne and parts of Tasmania over Christmas and it was quite cool even where I live - such a refreshing change. Enjoy your day off Sue - I hope you spend it in a disgustingly lazy way! Love to all, gb ",

Even though they grow up and go out into the world you love them with such an ache. I love all of mine so much but have always been especially in tune with my eldest as we are similar. There is nothing like a good, warm cuppa! I wish we were all with you right now, cosy and laughing together. In my imagination I can see us all there. We would crowd every bad thought out of the room. I won't be posting for a while so I just wanted to send you my warmest hugs and to let you know that I am with you in spirit.  Love to all gb ",

(I was away for 5 days and it's hard to catch up with everything). Sue - I am so glad your boys are safely back with you. I can really relate to you with these problems. It's been 20 years this year since I left my husband but I remember access visits for my boys were often hellish, with them not wanting to leave me and ringing me and crying, wanting me to come and get them but I couldn't. They have been damaged emotionally from the crap they have had to put up with from both their father and stepmother over the years. In many ways they are closer to their stepfather because he is kind and non-judgemental. I am so glad you have a good relationship with your ex as this will be so beneficial to your sons. I'm so sorry you are feeling so sick Sue and I hope you are able to rest and feel a little better on your day off. I love the new avatars! Gorgeous Poppy and beautiful Ulla (please don't say you are not beautiful - you have both inner and outer beauty - I can tell from not only your photo but your loving words of comfort and empathy you give to Sue and the others here who are sad and suffering). Sue, I think I know who Eva Cassidy is. I am pretty sure I saw a tv program about her a few years back and she did become more popular after her death. She had such a lovely voice. I saw Gone with the Wind such a long time ago I can barely remember it! New Year's Eve will be a quiet one for me. My partner will be in Sydney (to cut a long story short, we used to be married but divorced after 5 years of marriage. However, we got back together 4 years ago when I fell in love with him for the first time - I wasn't over my first marriage when I married him but it is so different now - I adore him! We spend weekends and holidays together. Anyway, I plan to spend a very contemplative New Year's Eve. I want to take stock of 2007 and try to take in all that has happened. I feel that I need to do this alone and to try to organise and make plans for a better year to come. I have been constantly with people for the past month and I need some alone time to just sit quietly, maybe write out some of my feelings and thoughts, do some painting and listen to music so I can be ready for my nephew and his wife and baby who are arriving on Wednesday. Love to all gb ",

Does that make sense?! The winter solstice has passed and the sun is headed back to you in the northern hemisphere - I will give it some pushes to get it there quicker - warmer days and healing are ahead. Each day you are getting closer to feeling well again. Poppy - your doctor needs to have some empathy lessons! Or maybe acting lessons so even if she doesn't feel for you she can act like she does - silly woman! Most of the people I know who had a doctor for a parent say that they rarely got any sympathy for their ills as they were growing up. Their doctor parent must have been all out of that from giving it out to their patients all day. Anyway, you will get lots of it here! Hope you feeling better by now. (You should have seen me slipping and sliding on the black ice in Canada - must have looked hilarious!)  Where is beautiful Ulla? I hope you are resting and feeling ok. When is your next treatment? Thinking of you up there in the north - the sun is coming back to you too, but please feel all our warm loving thoughts beaming to you while it's still cold outside. Karen - loved hearing about your holiday to the that beautiful Christmas card place. Doing positive, happy things like that must be good for your healing.   Much love to everyone, gb ",

Yes, just googled it and it does - it is also good for people with colds so maybe you could have one too Lisa? Just a warning though, I know you have to be very careful with natural remedies when you are on chemo as natural substances can interfere with the effectiveness of the chemo drugs. But seeing as it's an external thing, you wouldn't think it would matter. Does anyone else know about this? I love to think of you curled up with dear Zippy, Sue. Pets can be so soothing with their beautiful eyes, fur etc and a cat's purr makes me feel so relaxed - love putting my ear to them and listening to it! Ooooh - I want a pet again!  Mel, still thinking of your sister and praying for her. The waiting for both of you really sucks. Ulla, you are often in my thoughts and I hope you are feeling not too bad after your treatment.  It's like the steaming jungles of Borneo here today and I can hardly move due to the humidity.

When I was about 10, I had a beautiful dog called Pooch (highly original name!). I also had a cat called \"Girl Cat\" (a very imaginative name!). These two animals loved each other - had to be together all the time. One day Girl Cat got an abscess on her neck. Pooch spent hours and hours licking her neck until the abscess burst and then healed remarkably quickly. They were even closer after that. I think I remember reading that there is a substance in dog saliva that has healing and/or antibiotic qualities. Hugs, gb ",

It's strange - we live in 2 worlds - there is the tragic world of pain and sadness and then there is the beautiful, happy world. Sometimes when I am feeling really happy, I think that there are so many people out there that have just had really bad news, have been injured or are sick etc and then, when I'm sad I think that there are people at that moment that are filled with joy and are looking at the world in such a different way! Then there are just the daily ups and downs of the day when your mood is unrelated to outside events. I have to admit that when I feel down, it's hard to see the good in life even though you know there is beauty and things to be thankful for... I think this is where friends like the wonderful women here help you to build a bridge back to the good world. It might be Shirlann telling us that delightful story of Cleo's dear little paw lifting her eyelid - such a gentle, sweet thing - it really brought a smile to my face. Or it might be the beautiful photos of the sweet sisters and their kids and grandkids, the big defiant statements about bootface - \"Cancer Stinks\"! But mostly, it is everyones' kindness, encouragement, humour and love. I bought an Eva Cassidy cd this week. The first track is \"What a Wonderful World\" - it is just SO beautiful. What a voice that beautiful soul had! My interview was very encouraging and it looks as though I will get some work - when they get their funding. I went to talk with the principal of a school. He was such a nice man! The school is in the middle of a very rough area - so many social problems, child abuse, parents in jail, drugs, lots of dysfunction. Yet I came away with a really good feeling about the school. If you have a good principal it makes such a difference to the morale of the staff and that helps with the kids. So, to cut to the point, I am hoping to go back to school as a teachers' aide. The pay is pretty good and you don't have the same stress levels. If I feel more confident after some time doing that, I may go back to teaching. I had such bad experiences in my first year doing relief/casual teaching that I felt a complete failure. The kids have such a collective attitude towards casual teachers - law of the jungle applies. This lovely principal I met today said that he taught as a relief teacher for a while and he completely lost his nerve and believed he was no good as a teacher. I found that SO encouraging! He felt like that and now he is head of a really challenging school. It really made my day and I feel that at last I have some goals and something to strive for. The last 2 years really knocked the stuffing out of me! Saw a good saying on a desk in an office today. Old Japanes proverb: \"Fall down seven times, get up eight\". I am going to apply that to myself - I need to toughen up! Gosh, I have raved on tonight. As you can tell, I love to write! I think I forgot I was online and thought I was writing in my journal!  Sue, so great that you are feeling a teeny weeny bit better. Thank you everyone for your encouraging words to our precious Sue and equally precious Karyll - praying so hard for both of you girls. Karyll - enjoy the pampering from your sweet friend - I bet it will give her so much pleasure to spoil you! And wonderful, selfless Ulla, facing your own chemo and yet searching for encouraging information and passing it on to Karyll. Many hugs of thanks to you for being such a darling. I so hope that your final chemo treats you a little less harshly. Thanks so much Valerie for giving us a bit of news about Val. It's good that she is able to take the pills and is not having bad s/effects. (((((Valsul)))))  Lisa, please rest and take it easy this weekend - that's an order! You have to heal up and be strong for you surgery. It's great that you have such a good medical team and your p/s has a great reputation. You will be even more gorgeous! Mel - loved your post and your encouraging words. You are fantastic!  Hi Lucy! Love that name - but I love Poppy too - one of my favourite flowers!  You might remember me telling you about Pooch (same one who saved the cat's life). Well, he was such a gentle dog. Whenever he caught a rabbit, he wouldn't hurt it at all. He would just hold it down and look at me as if to say \"What do I do now?\" I would tell him to let it go and the rabbit would go leaping away - I would have to tell him not to chase it again! He just liked chasing rabbits - but he couldn't bring himself to hurt them. He was such a  unique dog! All those I haven't spoken directly to - Karen, Val, Wren, Sheila, Angie (this is really good mental gymnastics! Oooh - squeezing that grey matter - Mia, and anyone that I haven't mentioned - lots of love and I hope you all have a good weekend. It's nearly 10pm here so off to bed I go. gb xxx ",

About the hot baths - I used to love getting into a big bath tub and soaking in hot water but alas - I can't do it any more! Apparently it can bring on lymphoedema. The heat makes the lymph go crazy and it can pool in your arm, scar or wherever the lymph nodes have been damaged and then your arm starts to swell big time. I am not saying hot tubs will give LE to everyone but it is one of the main things they (lymph specialists) warn you not to do. Sorry to be a spoil sport! I am going to really miss my hot baths next winter - they are such a great way to relax - especially if you have candles and relaxing music playing. Bloody LE - it's something you don't focus on before surgery but you have to be careful to keep it from taking hold or treating it for the rest of your life. Sending healing prayers and warm thoughts to you for a rapid return to feeling good again. Hugs, gb ",

It does sound like either overwork or a bug. Hope you can really rest up over the next couple of days and are feeling better soon. Sue, hope you have a restful Sunday. Curl up with the Zip and have a really lazy day. I hope you make a big fuss when you see your medical people next time so you can get more pain relief and hopefully see a good lymphology person who might be able to offer you some relief as well.  This weekend I am cat sitting and house sitting for a friend. She has a dear old marmalade cat called Oliver who turned 17 on the 10th January. He has diabetes and I have to inject him with insulin twice a day. He doesn't seem to mind at all - just associates it with a food reward immediately afterwards! I have just dashed home to check on my potplants and to see if I had any emails. My friend doesn't have the internet on.  Well, I'd better get back to my big marmalade boy. Love to everyone - Lisa, Sue, Shirlann, Mama Mia, Poppy, Mel, Wren, Sheila, Auntie Em, Valsul and if I have forgotten anyone, it's just my dull brain! gb xxx ",

I was so interested to know that you're interested in art too. I wish I had gone to art school. I have done quite a few art classes and would love to do more. Sue, so sorry you have the nasty flu. Pleeeeease take a sick day! Then you will  have 2 days in a row to rest and give your body a chance to fight off this bug. Wish I could make you some spicy chicken soup! Think how happy Zippy would be to have you to snuggle up to for 2 whole days!  Maybe I could become a mystery shopper on the side. Ulla, how is your arm? I know you are going through hell and my thoughts and prayers are with you. Valsul, you are in my thoughts and prayers too. (I pray for everyone on here). Mel, how frustrating that you and your sister (and mother) have to wait until tomorrow to get the results of her tests. My prayers continue for a great result. I don't have the patience to be a good teacher. I have taught adults before and I found that a lot easier but my confidence is low lately. Karen, hope the weather is improving. Even though I always say I love winter, I have never had to sit out a really long, snowbound one. It must be very frustrating. Are you serious about moving house? Perhaps you should get through your treatments and feel strong and healthy again before you do that. Poppy, I was so glad to hear that your fluid in your back is going down. It must have been sooo uncomfortable for you. I sometimes wish I had had the opportunity to have recon at the time of my surgery... I don't think I want to risk it now as I seem to be prone to lymph build up. Sheila, great about your nipples looking good. I loved hearing about your dh's plans for his tattoo to salute you! So glad to hear that your son has sailed into more peaceful waters.  Mia, Wren, Shirlann and anyone else who has escaped my present state of mind, hope you are all doing ok.  Love to all gb xxxx ",

As a kid I used to sit on a rock in front of our house, worrying about whatever family member was out - praying for dear life - but at the same time certain they had had an accident. I had leaned to think like that because my mother always voiced her fears! Now I tell myself to not worry until I know something definite and I distract myself. Most of the time it works and I don't think I am really like my mother. She has multiple phobias - thunderstorms, frogs, germs... the list goes on! When my sister was about 10 she read my mother's diary and the words \"...if I shuffle off this mortal coil any day soon...\" made her wonder what she was talking about. I think she must have asked someone or looked it up and realised that my mother was talking about impending death! Pretty scary for a 10 year old to cope with. Anyway, my mum is now nearly 91 so she had many years ahead of her. I though pessimists were supposed to live shorter lives?!!! Jane. xx ",

I really think it's a great plan for next summer - something to look forward to. Lisa - loved your pics of your darling little gradson - what a treasure he is! Please give him my late birthday wishes. Such a lovely photo of your daughter too (so pretty!) and that one of you holding Matthew with his dear little hand on your breast - so sweet! Hope Olivia is feeling better. I felt so angry over her boss's unfair attitude - what a stinker! Karen, please don't feel bad about the car bump - it happens to everybody sometimes and besides, you have a good excuse! You are just great the way you keep going through all this horrible chemo. Hope you are having a wonderful weekend away. So good to hear from you Karyll but sorry to hear that you are doing it tough too. Please come back again soon and rant to us - we would love to have you. Melody, it was great to see you long post about how you felt divinely led to this site and how all the wonderful women helped you through your darkest times. Your posts are always inspiring. Sue, Lisa, Karen, Mel, Ulla, Shirlann, Tender, Wren, Mia, Poppy, Sheila, Auntie M, md mouse, Val, and anyone else I have forgotten - hope you all have a good week and my special prayers for all who have treatments this week. Hugs, gb ",

Now you can celebrate finishing chemo - I hate that you had to wait so long to be able to do so but so thrilled the scan was clear. Fantastic! Big hugs and love to you! Karen - you ARE employed! You are doing a wonderful job being a mother under difficult circumstances so I don't want to hear the \"u\" word! I am currently unemployed and I have no kids at home! That's so exciting about the nursing - you will be such a great nurse! I took leave of absence last year and it wasn't just because of bc. It was because I couldn't get a full time job in teaching in this area and casual teaching was so stressful I just didn't want to do it while I was getting over surgery and lymph problems. So I'm the only one here who is a total wimp! I now have to wait until they process my re-registration before I can hopefully do a bit of teachers' aide work. I have also applied to do a part-time mental health course at a college near here with the view of widening my options. AE - sending you warm thoughts and hugs. The mammo is sure to go well but this is a stressful time and I hope you get great results asap. Sue, I am glad you are having a restful day - you are exhausted and you need to take it easy on your day off. I loved hearing about the beautiful afghan - what a lovely thing to receive! You can snuggle under it with Zippy! Thanks for posting that link - I will look at it in a minute. Sheila - the weather sounds great there! Can you please send some over here?! It just can't stop raining! Love to everyone Jane xxxx ",

I am sure you probably do have shingles. It is a typical reaction of the immune system when it is stressed. My first husband got it once and he was in a lot of pain. As far as I know, he has only had it once. You can't get it if you haven't had chicken pox previously. As far as the dr misdiagnosing? Annoying and frustrating but doctors do make mistakes. You do need to rest as much as possible and let your body gain some strength. You are so strong Sue - I cannot believe how you do it! Working every day, feeling exhausted, caring for your boys...you do it all, feeling rotten most of the time but you keep going! That is true courage and bravery. Karen, I am thinking of you too and your approaching surgery and rads. Did I read that you are having your surgery next Wednesday? When do you start your rads? Surely they will let you recover from you surgery before they start zapping you? Sheila - yippee! You will soon have your tattoos and your recon will be complete! It has taken so long, hasn't it? I hope you and your husband will be thrilled with the final results. Where is Ulla? Ulla, please just send us a few words to let us know that you are alright. You are a very special member of this thread. Shirlann - how is Walt and how are you? Have been thinking about you both. Hope they are making progress with a dx and will be able to give him something to stop the dizzy spells. Lisa, how are you? I am guessing that you are pretty stiff and sore. I hope Olivia or someone can post soon and let us know how you are feeling. AE, I am thinking of you and wondering how you are. When do you have your biopsy? My sister rang this morning to say she was safely with her daughter in Canada. She flew the long way and was 27 hours in the air - plus a 2 hour stopover in Abu Darbi. She is exhausted and hopes her daughter's baby won't be born until she has a good sleep!  Hi Lucy, Mel, Tender, Dawn, Mia, Angie,  Auntie Em, Wren, Barbie, Pearl and everybody here. Love to you all.

      "Content": "Jan 25, 2008 09:03PM - edited Jan 25, 2008 09:03PM by geebung Angie, when I first started my teacher training there were quite a few students who openly admitted that they had chosen teaching due to the \"long holidays\" and because they thought their working days started at 9 and finished at 3! Hah! Their eyes were soon opened when it became obvious that teachers spend most of their \"holidays\" preparing their programs for the next term, taking part in \"inservice training\", etc etc. Most teachers here would be lucky to get 4 weeks during the year where they leave their work behind and start to relax. And as far as the \"short\" working day - well, in the first couple of years out, you have to be at school well before starting time and usually for at least an hour or so after the kids leave. It's a hard slog.  So, no, I don't think it is a problem here. I think the main thing is that you do have to be cut out for this profession because it is really challenging. Society has changed so much. When I went to school most kids had quite a lot of respect for their teachers. The downside was that I think discipline was often a little harsh. Now we have come full circle and it's the teachers who are struggling with the kids. So many come from really sad, dysfuncional families and teachers have to contend with very disturbed, angry children. There are some wonderful, loving families out there who have the right amount of discipline and children from these families have such a huge advantage. hugs,  gb ",

Karen, I am thinking of you and so sorry you have this additional worry about your lungs. It's not fair that you should have this burden on top of everything else. Hi Sue, please don't feel bad about eating. You can always lose it later - you are young and it's easier to lose than when you are older like me. What a beautiful prayer Melody - you are such a comforting and loving presence here.  Lisa - Monday the 4th of Feb - it will soon be over and you can begin healing and looking more beautiful. Will be thinking of you over the next few days. I love charity shops too. I worked in one last year - just for one afternoon each week and I got some fantastic clothes - really good quality and they seemed to have hardly been worn at all. It's such a buzz to get something nice for just 2 or 3 dollars. Hi to Val, Ulla (so glad you are feeling a bit better!), Tender, Valsul, Cyndy, Angie, Hawkwoman, Lucy, Shirlann & Sheila.  Hugs to all, jane. xxx ",

I watched a beautiful show on tv last Sunday night called \"Big Sky Bears\". It was about a mother black bear and her 2 cute little cubs - Archie and ...?

You must take after your gorgeous father! I can't understand her - you are SO loveable, have such a great personality and sense of humour. All I can say is that she is missing out big time. Families are wierd things aren't they. My sister is the only member of my family that I really gel with - she is 10 years older than I am and was always more of a mother to me than my own mother. Our relationship is much more mature and equal now - I'm not really her little sister any more.

I have a song on one of my cds that says \"I want to kill this bastard disease...\" She is probably singing about love sickness or something but I always think of bootface - particularly when I hear something as sad as what Lucy has told us. Hugs to you Lucy - your poor colleague and his family - I am so sorry. AE and Bill - my thoughts are with you and I pray for you both. Life isn't fair. May you continue to have strength and put up a good fight and really kick this bootface hard. Sheila - I always find your posts heartwarming. It's so lovely that you have such a great dh the second time around. He sounds like such an affirming, loving man. Bless you both. Lisa - hope you had a great time out to lunch - happy times promote healing - I am sure of it. Karen - I hope everything went really well with you surgery and that you are comfortably resting now. It will be great to hear from you again. Wren - hope your pain is fading. Gentle hugs to you. Sue it makes me so happy to know that you are feeling a bit stronger and more optimistic lately. You are such an inspiration! Dear Zippy - he just can't bear to be away from you - I think all the cuddles and attention over the last few months has gone to his head and he feels neglected if you leave him for a moment! I am catching the train to Sydney tonight to meet my s/o and then driving to the mountains in the morning. It's going to be stinking hot tomorrow so hopefully we will escape the main heat and feel some cool mountain breezes. So I will catch up with you all on Sunday (your Saturday!). Hope you all have some good moments over the next few days  Lots and lots of love to you all - including Shirlann, Melody, Valsul (thanks so much for the update on her AE), Angie, Mia, Tender and Ulla and any my busy brain has missed. And I am still thinking of Karyll - wish I could know how you are. Hugs, Jane xoxox ",

Hi Nancy - will be thinking of you and your appointment - I hope your blood results are good and that the chemo has really given bootface a king hit. All our calendars said that Daylight Saving Time would end on Saturday night but the powers-that-be decided to extend it by another week. So yesterday there was a lot of confusion from people who hadn't read the papers or listened to the news and a lot of computers and older cell phones automatically wound back an hour! So now we have to wait until next Saturday night for DST to end. The mornings are chilly and dark so it will be nice to have the sun next week.

I will be looking after Oliver this weekend (friend's cat) and was waiting for my friend to drop off her house keys to me. As she was in a hurry to get back to her work, I sat on the front step to wait for her. I thought I heard a cat sneeze in the shrubery beside the steps so I started making cat noises and calling \"puss, puss\" softly. Then I heard a rustle and a blue tongue lizard crawled up on the step beside me, his bright blue tongue flicking in and out! They are gentle creatures (a type of skink) and they eat garden pests. Anyway, I just happened to be wearing my blue Crocks and Bluetongue came right up to my foot and licked my blue shoe! Maybe they like blue! Maybe it liked my voice? Maybe it was escaping from a sneezing cat... He (she?) sat there for a few moments, looking up at me and then crawled slowly away. I still don't know if the sound I heard was Bluetongue sneezing, a cat sneezing or my imagination - hopefully not a cat because they eat blue tongues! gb xxx ",

Sue - so sorry your mouth is starting to hurt already. Oh, I will be sooo happy for you when these treatments are over. Damn stinking bootface! I heartily agree with your rant against it. What a stinking, rotten disease it is. But Sue, you are beating it. You have already beaten it. All these rough treatments are just extra precaution to ensure that it doesn't come back. Ann - always great to hear from you! Love to you too. Shirlann - you must be so excited about the Amazon! When do you go? What a great experience it will be. I am sure you will get vaccinations against all those nasty diseases. I hope you will show us lots of pics when you come back. AE - what a cute grandson! I wonder what he wished for after blowing out those candles? Jule - what an enormous dog! He must love you! And Sheila, I got a strong mental picture of your basset hound demanding a cuddle.

You poor love - I do hope you feel better soon. Sounds like it is a nasty tummy bug - they often seem to strike in the late winter and spring. I think you were brave to post when you feel so horrible. Sheila - the Land of Oz place sounds great - wow - I can imagine all of us going together - what fun! I think a truckie's job must be such a difficult one - deadlines to meet, staying awake, coping with inconsiderate drivers, eating on the run and being so far from their loved ones so often. Your dh sounds like such a good man. Sue - those rotten steroids - how long will the effect last? I hope you can sleep tonight. I am just so happy that you can now take days off if you don't  feel well enough to go to work - I do hope you will take advantage of this when you need to. AE - big hugs to you and UB. What a long treatment day - you must have both been so pleased to go home afterwards. The English tea day sounds great. I loved hearing about Delbert and the scones - what a character he is! Nancy - that really stinks about the insurance company. I hope your dear sister is able to prevail against them on your behalf.

It's now time for the action phase, the gaining of knowledge phase and the healing phase. You will soon know exactly what you are dealing with and you will be an active participant in the choices that are put before you. It may not seem that you have such choices but you do, and I know you will attack this disease with all your medical advisors to blast it out of existence.  It's after 8 o'clock Monday night there. I hope you have been able to do something nice with your dear sons to distract you and them. When they go to bed, it will be easy to let the panic set in but you are not alone. We are all here supporting you. Perhaps, as Karen suggested, a phonecall to Valsul might really help you. There is nothing like speaking with someone who has experienced the same thing as you. Maybe you could have a warm bath, with candles and soft music. Breathe deeply and visualise the disease being lifted out of your body and see yourself recovering and growing strong and healthy again. After my surgery, I used to listen to Dr Emmett Miller's healing cds. He has such a soothing voice. I listened to a lot of relaxation cds and I liked his voice the best.  Yes, ask for pre-med drugs when you get to hospital. These will really help you when you get there before you have the anaesthetic. You will soon be waking up in recovery Sue. You've waited weeks - these last few hours are just moments - try to see them as that - even though time seems to be dragging. You are in my thoughts and prayers. I am so looking forward to hearing from you when you get home. Love and hugs, gb ",

Somebody on these boards said recently that if the surgeon cuts the major nerve, you tend to have less pain and more numbness but that if they leave that nerve undamaged, there is a lot more pain.  Most of my discomfort came from the build-up of lymph after surgery. It seems that in the US they leave the drains in for much longer than in the UK and  Australia. (I had mine taken out on day 2 or 3) It's nice to get them out early but then you have to deal with the lymph. By the end of the first week after surgery, it looked as though I had grown another breast to replace the missing one! My surgeon aspirated it a couple of times then I started having lymphatic massage every week which really helped. Karyll is spot on about the painkillers - make use of them! They will help you to get a good sleep and that will assist your body to heal more quickly. (But you might need to take laxatives to avoid the usual side effects). And the small, soft pillow under the arm really helps to cushion the area and keep the arm away from your side.  love & hugs gb ",

Thanks Judie and Nancy for the info on the vacation dates. Nancy - your wig sounds so pretty - must be a good one if your friend picked it out too! I'm sending you my best thoughts and wishes.  Judie - Isn't it frustrating when you put a lot of effort into writing something and it disappears! It's hard to duplicate because you were probably writing 'in the zone' and sometimes you just can't get back into it... but I loved your post anyway! I heartily approve of your son having the insight to mature before having a child. I wish more people would take parenthood that seriously. He is sure to be a great dad. As part of the course I am studying, I have to attend 15 hours of a variety of community service activities. It's the launch of youth week here and it kicked off with rock concert this morning. I took my ear plugs and had had a great time. (Sooo glad I took the ear plugs - it was LOUD!) I was really worried about one young singer - he was screeching! When he announced the next 'song' he could barely croak! Some of the bands were very good though - especially if you stood some distance away! Don't I sound old?!  Karen, I am willing the rads to be over soon for you. Do you have someone to drive you there if you start to get really, really tired? I will pray for sunshine - you need it for your body and soul - and so do your poor fuschias! So good to hear from you Ulla. I'm praying for sunshine for you too - in many ways! And that goes for everyone else here. Melody - what a beautiful picture of the dove. Thank you. Lisa, I hope the housing market becomes more favorable for you. Can a condo be small? When we drove through the Rocky Mountains in 1986, the condos seemed huge! I guess I came to associate condos with luxury holiday homes but that probably isn't quite right. Interest rates and rents are soaring here and so many people are struggling to make their payments. It is causing a lot of financial and social problems.  Well, Sunday is dawning for you guys on the other side of the planet. Sue, I hope you have a great day - resting and enjoying your dear boys. Hope you can feel my good wishes to you. Lots of love to you all, as well as Wren, AE & UB, Jule, Sheila, Angie, Valsul, Lucy, Shirlann, Mia, Cyndy, Lucy...and anyone I've forgotten to mention.

It is such a sensitive area and was by far the most painful part of my surgery - and I only had 2 nodes out. You are doing amazingly well. Even though it isn't easy you just keep going and I do admire you so much.  More beautiful photos! Karen, your dogs are so beautiful! They do look laid back and happy.  I loved the photos of your Whippet, Shirlann. What a perfect athlete! Every muscle defined and stretched to the limit - brilliant shots! My sister gave me a book on puppies and the section on Whippets has gorgeous photos of a mother whippet with her beautiful puppies. They have such beautiful, sensitive faces. I can't wait to get a puppy! But how will I choose? I love so many different breeds! Melody - loved your photo of you and your son. You are both gorgeous and there's a lovely chemistry that is obvious - even in a photo. So glad you have a good son to support you.  Love to all gb ",

And after that Sue, you have to jump on a plane, ship or dolphin and come to Australia and stay with me! We should all start taking lottery tickets to fund the huge travel plans we are hatching! Poppy - so sorry you are still having lymph problems. Surgery really stirs up the lymph but it will settle in time. You have every right to moan - it feels so tight and uncomfortable. Any chance you can have some of it aspirated or massaged away to give you some relief? Welcome Ulla! You have had a lot of sadness but you have a wonderful sense of fun and optimism. I really enjoyed reading your post. Wow, aren't we an international group! Sunneedazee, I was wondering how you were - it's exciting about your hair growing back. Hope you are feeling better and that your treatments are now ancient history for ever. Karyll - you have such a knack for making me laugh - love the idea of the bank robbery look!  Hope you will post some pics of your trip Shirlann. It sounds like you had a great trip. Karen - loved your photo on the other thread of you and your son at the zoo. Hope you are feeling ok. This is a disjointed thread because I keep getting interrupted by people around me! Now I must go to the gym to try and whittle some of myself away. Love to everyone, gb ",

All that laughter would have done you a power of good. Fumi - you look wonderful! How lovely that your friend came all the way from the US to visit you. I love the internet - the world seems so small and the bonds across the oceans are strong. Shirlann, I meant to comment about the dreadful fires in Ca. It was unbelievably dreadful. I don't think Australia has had such a huge loss of houses - those winds off the desert must be ferocious! A few years ago, it was an especially bad fire season here and quite a few people lost their lives. A lot of Australian native plants need fire to germinate so it seems it's part of our environment. That's no consolation when there is a fire streaking towards your house though! Have a wonderful cruise Shirlann! We will miss you but we will try to keep Sue in order!

I really hope that you have at least one day off over the weekend because I am so concerned about you not having enough rest. Your sore swollen arm really should be seen by someone with up to date knowledge of LE. I am no expert but I think lymphoedma can occur any time after surgery - especially when you have had a lot of nodes removed. It may be just a bit of post surgery edema but I think you should have it checked out. Overuse makes your lymph unable to drain efficiently. Lymphatic drainage can be done by a physiotherapist who specialises in LE and it is so gentle and brings wonderful relief. Also, kinesio taping can really help after the massage as it lifts the skin slightly, allowing the lymph to drain more freely. I don't know if you have private medical insurance to claim some of the cost. I was able to claim through my private fund and when I had used all that up I was able to get on a \"plan\" with Medicare which gave me 6 visits for which I was able to claim. Sometimes they bind your arm, from hand to armpit to stop the lymph from pooling in your lower limb. You might also get a compression sleeve fitted. I have seen quite a few women wearing these while they work. In the LE topic there is a wonderful women (Binney) who knows a lot about LE so you may want to ask her opinion. I am not saying you have LE Sue but I am concerned and I would so hate to see you burdened with it. I hope I haven't been too bossy and opinionated. Love & hugs, gb ",
