Yes, my son...I felt the area and sure enough there is a tiny pea like something under there. Has anyone ever heard of such a thing??? He's almost 15 so definately going through serious changes...but this is a hard little pea like thing. This is certainly something I never thought I'd have to even think about let alone worry about. Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated. Thanks...in advance for your thoughts. Log in to post a reply",

Many of you are speaking of breast MRI's and results on ultrasound etc. I also keep reading about people meeting with surgens. First question, is there a reason I went straight from second mammogram to biopsy? Again they simply told me there was a mass that wasn't present on my baseline with a few calcium flecks in it. I know it is small but nothing else, which leads me to my next question...what questions should I be asking? They are going to perform the biopsy in the same place that I went to for the mammo. Does that sound strange to anyone? And why the big amount to time between mammo and biopsy? (at least seems like a big time span to me) Sorry, but I'm getting more confused and concerned as time goes on. I was a bit shellshocked during the last mammo and didn't do a good job of asking quesitons. Thanks for your help!!! Log in to post a reply",

I went in, but noticed she was on...what I thought...was the wrong side of my breast. Nope, turns out...the first Doc had done the US the wrong side (no wonder she didn't see anything). Today's Doc found the area and a couple more, which were clearly cysts. She decided to attempt a needle asp. of the area of concern, using US as a guide. She was able to get out a little fluid I guess and then sent me for a repeat mammo. The new mammo showed the area had shrunk a bit and look a tad different. She then presented me with 3 options. 1. continue with the biop, but given that the area of concern is so small she wasn't sure she could get a good sample and then we would be right back were we are. 2. Get an MRI 3. Do a follow up mammo in 5/6 months. She said she thought it was a messed up duct or something else with fluid. She didn't think it was malig., but of course we all know the only full proof way to know that is by biop. She said if it was her she would wait or do the MRI. I told her I would talk to my primary. So...any advice?? Feeling cuatiously optimistic, but still in limbo. A little concerned that the first doc did US on the wrong side...that seems pretty bad. Is a second opinion a good idea in this case...seems people are a bit confused by what they are seeing. Thanks much!!!!!!! Log in to post a reply",
