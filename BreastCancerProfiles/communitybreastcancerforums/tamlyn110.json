I am not looking forward to chemo, I start 9/9/09 but at the same time I want to get started and get it over with. It is nice reading the descriptions of what others are going through so I know what to expect. We can all get through this together.

I am not looking forward to it at all. I am actually quite scared. I will have a/c x4 and taxol once a week for 12 weeks. I had my bilateral masectomy with TE's on 8/5. I am still uncomfortable from that. The \"IRON BRA\" term fits perfectly for me. I feel so tight across the chest ad back that I don't know if I will be able to handle it until exchange which is now going to be a lot longer than first anticipated due to having to have Rads after chemo. Hopefully we will all handle it well and not have any problems. I look forward to keeping in touch with you all.",

I have been so depressed because I have gained 20 lbs., being bald and not having any energy/strengh to do anything. I just finished 6 months of chemo last week and start radiation next month. I just went back to work last week and it really wears me out. I am not me anymore and it sucks! I am worried everyday that it might come back and my onc. said no scans unless symptoms so that scares me even more. How do I know what to look for without worrying about every little thing. Everybody thinks I should be so happy since I am done with chemo now and I am but I still have radiation.... I am not done yet. The one thing that really gets me is everybody knows someonebody who has/had breast cancer and I have  to hear all about, even the ones who passed away. that really %&^**^$ me off.",
