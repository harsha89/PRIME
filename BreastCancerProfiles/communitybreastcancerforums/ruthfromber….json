The bad news is that literally just before surgery, my surgeon explained that the radiologist who put in my radioactive seed preop saw a 1 inch shadow. The surgeon explained this meant instead of removing a .6mm tumor, the surgical area would be larger. I still don't know what a shadow is, but evidently it isn't good! The good news is they found my one sentinel node and it \"looked good\". It is 1:30 am and I am up icing and taking Tylenol. Dr. doesn't like to give out pain prescriptions, but I don't think the pain is bad enough to warrant anything stronger than Tylenol anyway. Fingers crossed that this is the worst of it. I am wishing for a quick recovery for everyone who has been posting (and those who aren't posting too).Time to start waiting again for pathology.",

I am so happy for the people with good experiences and post-op recoveries on this board. I am scheduled for a lumpectomy and SN biopsy on August 29th. I won't have any drains, so it sounds less complicated to care for myself after surgery than others here. You are all awesome! I am a bit anxious, but am hopeful I can get this done and behind me. I feel like I have been waiting forever for surgery since I was first diagnosed.",

Hope everyone is able to relax and continue to recover on this Labor Day. It is beautiful weather here in Western Massachusetts. The green leaves of the trees against the blue sky look even more beautiful than usual. We were invited to a BBQ, but frankly, I am enjoying time alone in my lawn chair in the backyard with my lemonade!",

I have been wearing zip up sports bras. I find them tight too, but more comfortable than my others. I find the tightness over my SNB area uncomfortable, but it is worse without. Ice is still my best friend. I think I am just not going to be comfortable for another week or so. Sending healing thought to everyone",

The grade of cancer went up from my initial biopsy, but I am still Stage 1. The second area that appeared as a \"shadow\" when I had my seed locator put in the day before surgery was benign. I won't get the full report until I go in, but I was very grateful for the news. The office told me I will be looking at radiation and hormone therapy, but that will be discussed in more detail at my appointments in two weeks. I know I am going to have to make lifestyle changes so I will be physically/mentally healthier and stronger--I wish there was a magic wand so I just knew what to do. My well-meaning friends are giving me advice: \"gluten is evil\", \"wheat/sugar/dairy/_____ is evil\", \"do you use evil chemical household cleaners/laundry detergents/cosmetics/?!\", etc.... My head is spinning. I thought I might start with asking my well-meaning friends to save their advice for a few weeks and letting myself take some time to recover physically and emotionally before I jump into huge changes. I am just so tired. Anyone else have some well-meaning friends? Anyone else want to borrow some of mine...LOL?",
