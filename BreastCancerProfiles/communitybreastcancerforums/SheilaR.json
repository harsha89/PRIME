And it is STILL comng out and now I have little bald spots. Heck, I had a new little bald spot this morning. I know that this too shall pass but I swear I thought I would have more time.

My hair was already sort of short in an afro (I was going natural, no chemicals) and, sigh, it was just starting to grow before chemo. Double ugh. Anyway, my cutting it last week really short - actaully, my stylist closed the salon and cut it for me - was me doing it in phases. But I realize now that I just need to go ahead and have her buzz it. I will probably go back and buzz it this weekend. I'd rather shave it clean than have little patches.... I am SUPER scared about losing my eyebrows. I just, ugh, I can \"hide\" my bald head but I cannot hide no eyebrows. I guess I better figure out how to handle that.",

Have had two AC teatments so far - two more to go befor 5 of taxol.  My biggest issue with treatment one was, get this, hiccuping a lot and some acid reflux. This last treatment, my doc told me to take Pecid AC twice a day.  I did and it worked. No hiccups and one mild bought of acid reflux. The big thing for me now, and I knew this was coming, is how rapidly my hair is coming out. I thought I was prepared but I guess I was not. I think I will just go ahead and buzz it off this weekend.",
