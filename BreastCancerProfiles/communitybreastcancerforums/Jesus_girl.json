This picture below ISNT it. This picture above is my apparently a benign ductal ablation/cyst (???) whatever that means. But I keep looking up cysts and apparently....they look like this - Mine doesn't look like that. What are the tubey bits? Why are they saying its benign when it doesn't have clear round margins...I'm so confused. Off to the specialist on Wednesday to discuss all of this, but just wanting to weigh in on your thoughts xx Log in to post a reply",

I wonder what the benign causes of dimpling are...anyway - doc previously said she had no idea what was causing this little dent as it went away when i raised my arm up, now there is more indentation around that area but again, goes when I raise my arm up. Also have armpit pain, itchy breast at times, little stinging feelings at times. But I think perhaps I am super sensitive to any change or pain now that perhaps I am over thinking ;) Time will tell!",

Also, anyone else had back pain, between the shoulder blades, and radiating through to the chest with benign breast condition? Also have a breast dent, and flaking skin on the naughty breast as I call it. Would LOVE to find someone who has had similar symptoms to me, am trying to work out how I'm going to cope with this for the rest of my life without any way to treat it?! xx Log in to post a reply",
