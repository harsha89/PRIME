      "Content": "GPH wrote: My wife had an auxiliary node dissection last week after a mastectomy. We heard from the surgeon this week that only three nodes were found in the tissue she removed during the process; of these, one tested positive. During her mastectomy and sentinel node dissection, three of four nodes tested positive. The surgeon presented the results of the auxiliary as good news, but we are now worried that more nodes might be involved and should be removed. Looking at other posts, many people here seem to have had far more nodes taken out and checked. We are told that the treatment - chemo and radiation - would not alter at this point, regardless of the number of nodes that are positive (in our case, four out of seven nodes total have tested positive).. We feel adrift and worried...Thank you for any insights you might have. Log in to post a reply",

We are glad about the reduced risk of lymphodema and are now focusing on chemo, which my wife started yesterday, and which has left her very fatigued. It is so helpful to hear from other people who are going through this.",
