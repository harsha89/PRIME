I know that most cysts are benign, but knowing this logically doesn't seem to be helping me calm down at all.  I guess part of my problem is that I really don't have very many friends and I usually go to my mom with stuff like this and while she knows that it is going on, I don't want to burden her with my anxiety when she is facing her own health issues.  My husband is a born optimist and thinks I worry way too much anyway so he doesn't really understand how I'm feeling (though he is a sweetheart and is very supportive -- he just doesn't get how I feel).  My Dad is a pessimist and he actually makes me worry more about this because he is just convinced it is cancer.  His mother died of breast cancer when I was 19, so I guess that explains why he is more worried. I guess I just needed a place I could vent without worrying anyone else.  I have 2 kids (ages 10 and 8) and obviously I can't really fall apart or be too stressed out because I don't want them to know anything about this.  I don't want them to worry every time mommy has the sniffles or feels tired that it could be something serious.  But it is hard to walk around pretending that everything is fine and normal when I feel like nothing is. To make matters worse, since the biopsy is tomorrow and they said the results would take about a day ... it means that I now get to find on the Ides of March!  Ugh.  I'm not a terribly superstitious person ... but as an English major that phrase \"Beware the Ides of March\" is just running around in my brain.  Silly, I know.  But it is what it is.  Any advice on strategies to calm myself down and keep me from jumping on the train to Crazytown?
