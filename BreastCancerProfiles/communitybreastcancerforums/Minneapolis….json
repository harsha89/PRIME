I was curious of all the pain, sensation issues people have been feeling. I read that you feel the cold drink and I definitely have that issue, also feel the same when I get chills from being cold. Most of my pain is the underside of boob near incision, my sides just below armpits and sometimes between boobs kinda over sternum. I just was wondering if this is similar pain that other people are having? Just want to rest assure that it is normal pain. It feels like pressure, tenderness and tightness times. Thank you in advance Nicole",
