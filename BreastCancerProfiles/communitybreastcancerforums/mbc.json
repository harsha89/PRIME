I have now had this surgery for almost sixteen months. I'm male and I got breast cancer as in my european town there was a spike in cancer cases (heavy pollution) so even the rare male form is becoming common. All my lymphonodes had been cut so i immediately developed a swelling in my arm and hand that was diagnosed as a stage three lymphoedema. I couldn't perform any task involving lifting any weight, even mynimal ones. I ran across Dr. Becker's technique reading this forum, being an addict to reading can be extremely productive, in my purportedly advanced corrner of my nation no physician would know of a remedy to this condition. Actually they practice a deviation of lymph into veins called anastomosis which has, rightfully, a bad fame of making things worse. After surgery I experienced an immediate relief in the hand , the turtle like swelling of the upper side disapepared just the day after surgery revealing again the veins' and tendons' structure. Arm was less swollen.but I was warned that for at leat two years I had to consider myself still sick, even if recuperating. Dr. becker was optimistic and told me I was looking good and that i would heal completely It went on like this with some minimal, but continous, tendency at deflating for almost a year: nontheless I had to be careful and take specialized massages quite often (it's a specially modified Vodder method massage that was developed to support transplanted patients. The usual Vodder is actually dangerous according to Dr Becker's support specialist). Roughly six or seven months ago I attempted some heavy (in relative terms) use of the arm and it started responding pretty well, with just mynimal swelling after exercise (light hammering): this swelling would be gone within an hour or even less. But it was two months ago that things started going really well. Coinciding with a good diet, I started to notice a marked improvement around the writst, where some deformation was still quite evident: there was a great improvement with wrist getting back most of its shape: what was more interesting, under an heat wave I could walk without noticing any swelling even after a long walk. I even took a long hike under a scorching sun with a semi-light backpack and the arm came home without practically no damage, staying the same after the walk and an hour of car drive. Since approximately a month after that the difference between my sick arm and the normal one took to look not much noticeable from some distance, moreover the forearm is still slightly swollen but its complex shape is again discernible, while before it was still shapeless and lumpy. Most important, it keeps stable even under 30-40 celsius heat. Dr. Becker said it would take two years before healing, and she was quite right. After sixteen months I now have an almost normal arm that I can use for carrying the usual packs of water from supermarket without damage, while I can even do soem light hamemring while tinkering in my lab with no consequences, barring some light swelling that ebbs quickly with some brief rest. Today I woke up with a really nice looking right part of my body so I thought it was the rigth moment to post a first report. Scar is another question but I got a huge cheloid from forst surgery, it grew again after transplant despite care but this is a problem that relates to my delicate skin:in any case Dr. Becker was also successful in transferring some fat into my armpit, covering badly cut nerves that had become a real pain after first surgery, so that I was also freed from a continous pain coming from sort of jolts such severed nerves were producing under stress. So i'm now starting to feel extemely satisfied with the results.        ",
