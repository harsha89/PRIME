She was predeceased by \"Ethyl\" some years ago.  I had to finally have Lucy euthanized last year for kidney problems . I lost my job, my insurance and then Mom last year. Maybe your response just a  little serendipity, but hope there's an underlying message of hope that I'll find helpful insight at this site. No lumps, although that's why my doctor ordered the needle biopsy..it was negative..although my breasts have clearly gotten dense over the years. I've always done regular exams in the shower.  I'm just having this pain in my breast...and pain from fear..which has been lessened by your taking the time to chat with me.  I haven't mentioned this to my daughter as she's in Texas with her husband and my two grandsons and don't want to alarm her...til it's necessary. Thanks so much, Lucy. I'll add a comment to the \"worried\" link.   Fond regards, Nancy",

I am a 58yr old grandmother having breast pain..an aching/burning sensation in L. breast. I've had normal mamograms until the last one a few years ago.  I lost my job and insurance in May last year (2007) when I left my job to help care for my mom in hospice.  She died last month on Dec 10.  I've been looking for a job again and trying to deny this pain, the hot flashes, etc.  Alas! I hope it's not too late.  I've been on hormone therapy (Premarin) since 1990 when I had complete hysterectemy after long history of gyn probs, including 2 Class III pap smears, a few surgeries for benign tumors, etc.  I never had any probs with my breast, although had to have a needle biopsy (negative) about 10 years ago after my breast started getting more dense.  I took my Premarin until Oct, 2007 when my last rx ran out. Within a month, I started persistent and severe hot flashing. My sister gave me some Premarin (a lower dose than I was taking) and I started taking one a day in late Nov. 07. I started having pain last month (early Jan, 2008), although the hot flashing has continued. What do I do? I can't afford a mamogram. Have no idea what to do or who to talk to. So afraid. This website discusses cysts and pray maybe that's what this is, but where do I start? A clinic or hospital?  Any insight about my pain and how to get diagnosed with no insurance appreciated.    ",
