Your mind is the biggest and best sex organ in your body.  Get creative, reconnect and most importantly, allow yourself to relax and enjoy being with your husband again.  It really, really helps the healing process.  You owe it to both of you to give yourself permission to have a good sex life again.  Don't be afraid.  You've gone through way too much to get scared now.

(didn't have enough padding to build two breast from other areas of my body)  You will also need to wait until you know the stage and grade of your cancer, if you have any lymph node involvement and whether your tumor is hormone receptive or not.  It will all come together a little clearer as you go along on this journey that nobody wants to take.  I dropped about 15 pounds since my diagnosis too.  Keep checking back here often and ask any questions, we'll be happy to answer as best we can.  Keep your head up and hang tough, we're all here for you.
