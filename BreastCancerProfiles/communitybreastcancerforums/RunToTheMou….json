The day I got results they told me they had been sure it was going to come back malignant. Now I have an MRI scheduled for this Friday. I was not good on getting mamograms. I have been having pain in my arms, shoulders, neck. I am afraid I have let it go too long. I had  sore on my nipple that healed twice and the third time I finally went to md. Should I be worried because I already am. thanks",

I am not diagnosed yet but they keep tossing around pagets bc.  I did not do anything for a while about my nipple changes thus I am afraid it is advanced.  It has been over 3 weeks and mri, ultrasound, biopsy (which was messed up) and I still haven't gotten answers. I have a surgical consult tomorrow. But I am having a lot of pain in my arms, elbow, low back that I have never had before. I am scared. Everyone keeps telling me to relax. But I will not relax until I find out for sure. In the mean time if someone has metz to bones could they please describe this to me? I have been hanging on a thread since this all started.",

I am having mastectomy this Friday.  I ignored nipple changes for a long time.  I finally addressed it and now I am afraid i waited to long.  I felt fantastic up until recently. Now I feel sick.  I am afraid my cancer has progressed. So if someone out there had bc and felt sick before sx and could share it I would appreciate it. I have my first appt with oncologist this Wed.  I just feel bad all over including aching arms and back pain. I think my ca may have already metz. Did anyone feel this way before sx and found out it wasn't stage 4. Thanks",
