Please note that I live in Ontario I had my BMX this morning, No reconstruction. And I am home right now with minimal pain. 7AM - Registration. A nurse gave me a gown, pants and booties. She said I can keep my underpants and socks on. 8AM - Had a Sentinel Node Radioactive dye injection. The procedure is called Lymphangiogram. This is new to me and had a little discussion with the tech as this was never mentioned and told her to double check. I thought its like an IV blue dye for visualization. But then she double checked and i was really scheduled for this. So she injected a radioactive dye in the breast near the tumor (i have tumor on both breast). Then she asked me to massage the area for about 30 mins. And I got a scan.. just like when you go for bone scan, but this scan takes only 7-8 mins. 9AM - I was back to waiting room and had a chat with the patient who will be having Unilateral Mastectomy later 9:10 AM - I was given 2 Tylenols with little sips of water while in waiting room 9:30 AM - I was brought to the BLOCK Room. Looks like a recovery room but lesser patient. I think only around 4 patients. It is where they do nerve blocks. So the anesthesiologist came and inject anesthetics on both axillae, 3 mL on each side and it is ultrasound guided!!! they said this is to make sure they don't go too deep and avoid penetrating the lung. i was told this will help me post- op. I wish I put on my lip balm as my lips starts to crack from being NPO since last night. 10AM - i was wheeled inside the OR 10:30 - they gave IV meds which makes me sleepy but still able to answer simple questions. Then they make me inhale to the face mask and then that's it... 1:30PM - i woke up in the recovery room. Pain is around 3/10. Then increased to 4, then 5. The nurse gave me Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) thru IV and i fell asleep. 2:30PM - I was wheeled to Day Surgery. The nurse gave me iced Ginger Ale which relieved my throat pain at that time. I checked my dressings. Only large Medipore tapes that put pressure on my surgical area. There are only 2 drains, 1 drain on each side. Still dizzy when i sit up. The doctor came in and talk to me and said he removed 3 nodes on the right and 1 node on the left. I asked him when can i lift my arm. He said \"Right now!\". I am surprised. but probably because i didn't have reconstruction that's why. Or probably he is not that cautious as PS's. I will still take precaution as I don't want complications. 4:00PM - more awake and less dizzy. I had a call from Community Care Access (CCAC) about home nurse that's suppose to come home and check my dressing and drains. The nurse had arranged for this earlier right after i register.. She said to wait for her call tomorrow. 4:30PM - the nurse helps me get dressed. Amazing how minimal is the pain. She asks me to lie down in bed after, while waiting for my husband to pick me up. 5:00PM - discharged!!! At home I peed blue!!! So blue dye was still injected in the OR! I think this is for mass localization? eventhough with mastectomy? Oh well... I am just so glad I am home. I had dinner with my DH and my 2 kids. I was able to wash myself in the bathroom and scrub off the extra paint they use to sterilize the area for surgery. Dr. said i could take off the dressing after 2 days and can shower after 3 days even with drains. Follow up will be in 10 days. I had video chats with my sisters and friends and they are amazed with how fast things went and how mobile I am in less than 12 hours of surgery. Even me, i am surprised. The anticipation is worst than the surgery itself. So I will see tomorrow if the pain gets worse. It might also be the axillary nerve block that makes the pain under control. i will let you know.

I tried to palpate several days if there's underlying lump that's pulling the skin but i can't feel anything. Even the doctor can't feel it. It was found in mammo/US. What's more, i asked the doctor to do mammo/US of the other breast when i was referred to the Breast Diagnostic Clinic and there they found 2 more on the left. Up to the day of my surgery, i still can't feel the lumps on the my Left breast. The right breast lump became prominent after the biopsy.",

You are all brave. And you don't know how much you all inspired me. I wish someday I could inspire others too. My BMX is on Friday, feb3. Today I went to shop for post mastectomy camisole. I only bought 1 as I don't know if I really need it at home or the button down shirt with pockets are ok. And for the first time, when the lady who helped me asked when is my surgery, I was able to tell her my story without crying. Knowing all you're stories and what you're going through makes me stronger and I know I am not alone in this situation. Thank you ladies. I am looking forward to joinyou in the cabanas this weekend.",

      "Content": "Jan 27, 2017 08:44AM - edited Jan 27, 2017 08:48AM by Grande Hi, I've been a lurker for awhile. I spend many many days of reading through the pages of BCO and found it very informative. I want to join this thread even though my surgery will be on Feb 3. I will have bilateral mastectomy with no reconstruction. I am 42 y/o and was diagnosed with bilateral bc. I initially chose lumpectomy + radiation as my BS said it is also equivalent to mastectomy. I don't want mastectomy then bec of fear of lympedema. My job is very physical. It entails pushing, pulling and lifting. But then few weeks before my surgery, I felt another lump, away from my initial lump. I went to see BS and had US and talked to radiologist. She told me it is nothing. She said if it is greater than 2mm \"we will catch it\" .. What if it is smaller than that??? So I know I can't live with constant fear. I don't know what is normal anymore. I am doing BSE all the time. And I compare left and right. Never did I know that they are both abnormal because up until now I can't feel the lump on my left breast. BTW, my right has dimpling above the nipple which prompted me to go to family doctor. They found a mass there.When they do the left, they found 2 more there which is non palpable. I was sent for genetic testing because of young age and bilaterality. Results won't be back in time for scheduled lumpectomy so I called BS office and opted for BMX instead. It's a hard decision. But it will give me a peace of mind. The waiting really freaks me out. I lost 10lbs in 1 1/2month of waiting. Thank you for reading. I will be praying for our fast recoveries. Grande",
