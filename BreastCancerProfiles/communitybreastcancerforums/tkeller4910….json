I am five years out and it has always been right around 5. Then six months ago it jumped to 6.8 then back last week went to 7.5. I realize that these are not big jumps but I am concerned. I want to be as proactive as I can be and am looking for any advice I can get. My two children are both getting married this year and I am not letting anything ruin it. Thanks Tk ",
