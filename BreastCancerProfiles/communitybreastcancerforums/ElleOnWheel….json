What you have been through on both fronts is astounding...you are a helluva strong woman!! I'm new around here and know what you mean about feeling like a fifth wheel. There are some very strong bonds on this site...but I think most here are extremely welcoming, it just takes time to develop relationships. As far as radiation goes, I'm on my third go round right now. Had the original breast, then last May to my neck and skull, and now 8 in on 10 to my right hip. The treatment itself is easy peasy. And although I never had rads to brain mets, I did wear the ever stylish mask for the neck/skull rads and it wasn't bad. Depending on where it's being targeted you can get some side effects...I had a pretty tough time with throat and swallowing pain after neck, but it does ease up in a few weeks. You can do it!! After all you've been through this shouldn't be a problem. As far as the personal side...I am continously amazed at the behavior of so many humans. What can such so called \"friends\" be thinking? Obviously they didn't deserve you...same for the ex. I am happy to hear you have such a loving son for support and your granddaughters sound wonderful. Hug them tight and forget the other ones. Let me know how you're doing. I care and will be happy to be your friend. E ",

I had a dear, dear friend I met online that had to do all kinds of moves to get the port to behave. She would have me in stitches describing the port shimmy as she called it. Gracie...what great news on the tumor markers!! So happy for you. Mine are a mess...they slowly come down, then they shoot up for a few months, then they drop back down....and right now they are in the jumping up mode again. I see a scan in my future, but it's time. It will be about 5 months since I had one. Magda...I love that gate!! It looks beautiful. I have had many a baby gate with my furry children through the years but nothing permanent like that...I love it! Hope you are feeling well today. Grannax...there is NOTHING funny about scanxiety, but I did chuckle when I read your change in attitude. I can go from having myself dead and buried in a month to thinking I'll live for 20 years because I feel so good...crazy the ups and downs. Hoping for great results! Slooooowly catching up with everyone. You're an amazing bunch!!! As I mentioned I had a very busy summer. My job is extremely concentrated in the summer as we do 10 straight, 8 show weeks of musicals along with our cabaret venue. I'm the ticket manager and have been here just about 26 years. Last year I was diagnosed in May and for the first time ever didn't attend any of the shows or events that go along with them. I was just too sick and very weak from chemo. I kept up the day to day mostly from home and have the greatest boss/company in the world that never even batted an eye about it. What a difference a year, and change in treatment, has made. I made it to all 6 openings and opening night parties, a cabaret show, a few scattered events, a retirement party and worked my regular office schedule. And then there's my regular life stuff too! I am beyond grateful. Never thought I'd be so happy to do my job...but boy am I!! xo ~ E ",

Maybe this will wake him up...but probably not. Lynne, your flowers look beautiful!! Glad spring has finally sprung for you. I was back to cleaning out/mulching this past weekend. Still a bit to go... but we're getting there. Had cataract surgery today. Can't see a damn thing right now but doc says it went well. Fingers crossed!",

Your plan moving forward sounds wonderful and I think you made the best decision possible in this crap situation. I hope everything easily falls into place for you. Lynne... we are kindred spirits with the gardening. I just do flowers now, though. I have a tall fence that keeps the deer out, but the little critters ate everything! You have to laugh when you see a chipmunk running with a big tomato in it's mouth. I now mostly have flowering bushes...roses, hydrangias, rose of sharon, that type of thing. Then I do hanging baskets and window boxes for my annual flower fix. I will tell you... I too am QUITE the expert and growing weeds. 🙂🙂 Oop... time to get stabbed... more later. xoxo",

Seems I'm also facing some sort of progression as my tumor markers have been rising steadily for a few months now. They suck. Will be having a PET soon to get the real story. My wonderful onc is extremely calm about it all and said he's not overly concerned...that makes one of us. Ha! We had a long discussion about treatment options and decided I'll try staying on the Ibrance and switching to a different AI. That man has the patience of Job...I asked him a million questions and he thoroughly answered every one of them. Explained the difference between the various inhibitors/AIs, the worst side effects of each etc. He gives you options and then tells you to think about it and let him know how you feel. He likes to try to get the longest time possible out of each treatment....unless, of course, things are going crazy. I concur. For now I remain in my pretty constant state of denial and keep living my life. Micmel...busy lady!! When I was TRYING to catch up I so enjoyed looking at the shower pics. Everything looked beautiful....especially you and your daughter. Good luck with all the reception preparations. I know it will also be a huge success! Minnie, Holmes, Mae....hoping you all get good news with the scans. Thinking of you and jumping into the pocket. I'm the one constantly singing silly show tunes... Daniel, I'm so glad Leslie is feeling better. Make sure you're taking care of yourself too. My hubby spent many months in the hospital years ago and it is ROUGH to be on your side of things. Honestly I think it's harder at times. Grannax, I was so sorry to read about your progression. I wouldn't be particularly happy with my liver either! Hopefully you can zap it and get everything back in line. NO1, can you maybe move your MO appointment up a few days? Your stomach issues sound awful and I hate to think of you in agony. Better get back to work (oops).... love to all!!!! E   ",
