      "Content": "Bronte_Bear wrote: Hi,I was wondering if anyone has been diagnosed with transverse myelitis or neuropathy after having radiation to their spine? I had radiation to my T9 area, pelvis and dura on my skull in July 2014 and have now developed weakness in my right leg and numbness in my toes (since October 2014). It has gotten so bad that I now need to walk with a cane. My oncologists seem to want to take a wait and see if it gets better approach. Upon pressure from me, they've referred me to a physiotherapist. I am also pushing them to refer me to a neurologist, as well, in case they can add anything. I was wondering if anyone has had success with physiotherapy or any other types of treatment or vitamins etc that have helped you improve and retain your mobility? If yes, what sort of exercises or treatment did they recommend? Or did your condition just get better on its own? I have two young boys and want to do anything possible to get my mobility back. I need to be kicking that soccer ball with them again! Thanks. Any advice or information is appreciated.

For me, I hadn't been expecting radiation to do anything except lessen the pain so this all came as a complete surprise. Yes, it's extremely frustrating. I find it harder to deal with than the actual cancer as it's having a greater impact on my quality of life.  Can I ask what sort of physical therapy and exercises you found helped?  Thanks",
