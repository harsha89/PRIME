I was diagnosed on October 4th and had a MRM on October 11th on my left breast. All things considered, my pathology report disclosed that my tumor was only .8 cm but there was also cancer in the ducts and precancerous in some of the surrounding tissue. They told me that I was Stage 1, all my lymph nodes were negative for cancer. I saw my oncologist for the first time yesterday and he presented me with two options being that my ER was 90%. He told me that I could do hormone therapy alone (tamoxifin) or do 4xevery 3 weeks of chemo along with the tamoxifin. He thinks that because of my age, which is 39, that I should do the chemo also. I just wondered if anyone has any thoughts on this. I am confused as to what I should decide. I really don't want to do the chemo, but if I have to..oh well. I am really leaning towards doing the chemo also. Please, please, if anyone has any advice to give..please do so. I would really, really appreciate it.",
