The surgeon came back and said the pathology said I had this condition and that I needed to be seen by an oncologist as well as being on tamoxifen for five years I have many many many family members with breast cancer and other cancers so I am at a very high risk of getting cancer within the next couple of years. The problem is I can't find it oncologist that treats this condition I have called many Cancer Centers and they all say they only treat people with cancer.
