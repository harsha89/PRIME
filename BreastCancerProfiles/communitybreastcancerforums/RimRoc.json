      "Content": "Nov 3, 2013 11:28AM - edited Nov 3, 2013 11:31AM by RimRoc Hello everyone, I'm new to all this, as I just got the first biop results Oct 21, which was DCIS intermediate grade. I did do a lumptectomy and that biopsy came back with clear margins, DCIS grade 3 comedo type with necrosis. I had been contemplating skipping all therapy after the lumpectomy but reading the literature and knowing the higher grade of cell dysplasia made me opt for brachytherapy. The rad onc told me I was Van Nuys score 7, for which radiation was pretty much mandatory. The real reason I'm writing it to share with someone who's contemplating going thru brachytherapy it just HOW MUCH MORE this hurt than I anticipated. The Savi catheter insertion felt pretty brutal despite the local anesthesia used and the pointy tip of the catheter is poking me from the inside and really hurt a lot for the first 48 hours. I have now had the catheter repositioned once, and it is better. It does seem to get better with the passage of time. All this kvetching notwithstanding, I do firmly believe I will be glad I did the short version of radiation rather than the long version, once it is over. The other thing I'd like to share is for others not to try to just guts it through with a stiff upper lip and believe the \"all you need is tylenol\" advice from the surgeons and radiation oncologists. I am actually a trained medical professional (a nurse practitioner) so I guess I should have known better...but I would definitely suggest to others contemplating an internal catheter for brachytherapy to anticipate some actual pain (like 5/10) for a couple of days and ask for pain meds (and even anti-anxiety meds) and be ready to use them. If you don't need them, great! But don't let yourself sit around feeling awful if you can be more comfortable with short term use of appropriate meds. I tried to keep working thru the first few days of insertion/imaging/radiation and avoided both narcotic pain meds and anti-anxiety meds as I felt I needed a clear mind...but in retrospect that was a painful mistake! I have four more days of radiation to go and will definitely stay away from work for the next five days. I'm sure not as tough as I had thought! Definitely plan to take time to take care of yourself, including staying home from work. I wish I'd been less hard headed!",

Not that I wish the discomfort on anyone else, just the usual \"misery loves company\" thing I guess. I am now almost at the two week mark after the doc pulled the catheter, and I'm glad to say the discomfort level has dropped to the minor annoyance level. I did have about four days of a sort of emotional trauma, just processing the feeling of being so traumatized. The counselor at the Rad Onc office did offer the perspective that with the rapid move from biopsy to lumpectomy to accelerated radiation, there is sometimes just not enough passage of time to process everything. So time has helped! Now that I feel more energetic and am back at work, the intensity of the experience has certainly faded. Thanks again for sharing your experience with me!",

Maybe I'm an outlier...but I will say it hurt like hell when they pulled it out. I don't know why they don't use lidocaine for procedural pain like this. It took most of the next 48 hours to get over feeling quite brutalized by the whole thing. If you can deal with having a cavity filled without novacaine, then stick with the \"two Tylenol\" approach for catheter removal. However, if you don't want very intense, sharp, albeit brief pain, ask for a local anethestic!",

I am now one month out from ending accelerated rads and, miserable as the experience was at the time, I will say that now it is all a pretty distant memory. I have only occasional slight twinges of breast pain, all the skin poke sites (biop, lumpectomy, Savi insertion site) are healed with minimal scarring. I had very little in the way of skin harm from the rads, just slight discoloration and the skin pores look bigger and coarser. With 20-20 hindsight, I do not regret my choice of accelerated radiation therapy. I also remain really sad/angry/annoyed that the current state of science/research cannot give good enough prognostic guidance to help women safely decide to skip RT altogether when they have small site, low/med grade DCIS. We know a large percentage of women could probably live safely with DCIS treated with lumpectomy only...we just don't know which ones! and none of us wants to roll the dice... So, safe travels through the treatment pathways you've chosen. Thinking of you, RimRoc",
