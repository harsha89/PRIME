Mr dr gave me hydro-gel pads that seemed to be the most effective at soothing the oozing areas. So happy to be finished. Hoping it goes quick and smooth for anyone else going through it!",

She gave me samples of exclair because its 100.00 a tube, and she told me there was nothing special in it that I couldnt go to a health food store and make myself. Samples didnt do much good, so i was happy i didnt spend the $ for a script, as I am uninsured!",

I had 4 doses of ac, then was scheduled for 12 rounds of taxol. 8 minutes into the taxol ( even with the pre meds) I went into anaphalactic shock and had to have an epi shot and be rushed to the er. My dr told me i could stop treatment or try abraxane. abraxane is more expensive which is why drs look to see who can tolerate taxol or taxotere first.Taxol has a compontent in it called kremaphor which causes 37% of patients to have reaction. Which is why all of the pre meds are required. ( not sure about the taxotere) Abraxane is just taxol mixed with human blood protein instead. ( hence the increase in price) It was a tough decision for me as i never wanted to feel something like that again! With being stage 3 though, I decided to go ahead with it. The first treatment, we did a very slow drip,had the epi pen ready, and did the pre meds ( which arent usully required) I just finished my 7th dose of abraxane with 5 more to go. So far se are not great, but doable. The best part is pre meds are not required and it is only a half hour drip. good luck to you!",
