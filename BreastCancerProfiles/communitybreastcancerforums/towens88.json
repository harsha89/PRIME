I am scheduled next week to start the Lupron shots and to have my port put back in for the Zometa shots.  Should I get my ovaries removed??  I was on Tamoxifen for 2 years and it didn't work.  I also had a very difficult time with chemo 2 years ago.  I am in soooo much pain and I need to choose a treatment as soon as possible. ",
