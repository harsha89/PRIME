I had it put in at the same time as I was having another surgery so I did have a general but most have it done with conscious sedation. It can stay in as long as needed provided it is flushed/used regularly. It requires no other care once it's healed (unlike a PICC). I also get my blood drawn from it which is a plus. They spray it with a numbing spray before accessing and I don't feel a thing. If you google it and look for images you can see what it looks like. All you see is three raised dots in a triangle arrangement. Mine is much closer to my shoulder than most. Try it! Caryn",

I had a PET scan for a non bc related reason and found a bone met when there was no reason to suspect one. This doesn't make these things bad, false or deceptive, just imperfect.

It exposes one to unnecessary radiation and doesn't (statistically) increase survival time if mets are found. That being said, I had a PET scan, for non bc reasons, about 6 weeks after my stage IIB dx. Lo and behold, a bone met! No pain, no symptoms so I wouldn't have known it was there otherwise.

Tumor markers are useful in some cases, not all, but not as a means for diagnosing bc. Breast cancer stages are not \"reduced\". You don't go back from stage IV to stage II. Your stage IV may become inactive, but once bc has moved beyond the breast to distant organs, the horse is out of the barn. Good nutrition is wonderful but sadly, curing breast cancer is not that simple. You will certainly find testimonials from those who claim diet alone cured them, but you need to decide how much faith to put into personal anecdotes. Wishing your wife all the best.",

My preliminary staging came from the two different biopsies I had but final staging came via the path report post bmx. The final path report found my IDC to be larger than initially thought and I had 1 positive node. This moved me up to IIb. It was scary and upsetting and there was certainly some temptation to not want to know more. But in the end, the only way I could be an active participant in my treatment was to know as much as possible about my disease. Denial and magical thinking provide brief escapes but in order to fight the good fight you need to be fully informed. You can do it! Caryn",

Chickadee, I am not Christian but I did have someone, no even an acquaintance, suggest that accepting Christ as my lord and savior would go a long way toward curing my bc. I also had someone tell me that they were sad for me for not having Jesus in my life at a time like this and that I was probably lost. No offense to Christians, but it is incredibly arrogant and presumptuous to presume that your way is the only way. Hey, after all I'm one of the chosen people! Love that phrase, LOL. Seriously, religion may bring comfort but I don't believe it brings cure and I sure don't believe it brings cure only to those who believe in a certain flavor of religion. Caryn",

As others have said, once you have a treatment plan in place, you feel like you are actively doing something. The other thing I'd like to suggest is to learn as much about the specifics of your bc as possible. It will be a lot to digest and can be overwhelming so try learn a little at a time.

I should have said, in terms of learning about your disease, to stay away from dr. Google at large, and focus, with your onc's help, on your specifics. The stats that you find online are often several years old and reflect aggregates, not individuals. And while it is true that on any given day there are woman struggling at stage IV, you may have many good times to come (laced with some crappy ones too). When things settle down for you, pm me and we can meet for coffee somewhere on the Peninsula. I will be in the city next Sunday to board the Grand Princess for a week long cruise with my younger dd. I didn't think such things were possible when I first got my stage IV dx but I spent Christmas break in Australia/New Zealand and I still work full time. I do tire more easily, but I'm still here. Take good care of yourself  Caryn PS: If this sounds too rosy, the first months were awful, including a punctured lung. I still have too many medical appointments and I'm stiff as a board if I remain stationery for too long, from the Arimidex, and have gained some weight, but I don't have a foot in the grave yet.",

I don't know If PICC's can be used for blood draws, but a power port can, which makes it really nice. For chemo purposes, ports seem to be preferred in most of the US. BTW, I am one of the unlucky few, 1%, who had a lung puncture and I still love my port. My story is on one of the threads (lung collapse after port insertion?) but I can't imagine using my one good side for needle sticks. Caryn",

Let me preface this by saying that I have never been in your situation, so I am only speculating on how I might feel. My children are adults, so I have been very upfront about my situation, however, if they had been teens, I think I would have been just as honest. I have never wanted my BC to stand in the way of something they had a burning desire to do, even if would mean making us physically far apart. My older dd and SIL wanted to move out of the area at one time. They have since changed their minds but my daughter said it was , in part, because of me. That was very sweet but I want them to stay here mostly because this is where they want to live, not because of me. If I had a child going off to college, something they had worked hard for for years, I would want them to enjoy the rewards of that hard work by going to the school of their choice. Yes, it would be difficult but I would leavethe choice entirely up to them .",

That being said, I have taken it for almost three years. I take it right before bed, so if there is a relatively immediate tiring effect, I don't notice. Overall, I do tire more easily and by the time I get home from work, I'm pretty wiped out (I teach first grade. That could be the problem too ). I have some joint pain, mostly knees and ankles, but it varies and seems to be worse if I'm sedentary. My knees are not very \"springy\" anymore, so rising from a squatting position is not easy. If only the first grade desks weren't so low! My general advice to anyone who is on the fence about this is to try it. If your se's are bad, you can stop. Despite the minor se's, I do everything I always did . I even climbed the Sydney Harbour Bridge several months ago. Take care. Caryn",

The forum title does mention caregivers and supporters so it's to be expected that some will post here. When they ask for advice on how to help as a caregiver or support as a friend or relative, I think it is appropriate to point them to the caregivers forum. After all , many of us have never been in their position. I am not too thrilled about having to comfort distraught family members. It seems odd to me that they would turn to others who have the same disease, and stage IV no less, for comfort. The other thing is that it is hard to define what might be or might not be an appropriate post by someone who is not stage IV. Sometimes it is very clear when a post is inappropriate here but other times it's a matter of individual interpretation. Never the less, I would hope we are never mean to anyone who posts here when they probably shouldn't . Caryn",

It is also true that finding mets early does not increase overall survival rates. However, these are broad stats over a large group which may or may not be true for individuals. Yes, it is true that the number of tx options you have are limited, but there are many tx available and more coming down the pike. I doubt that anyone, with limited mets, would hold off on tx so they don't use up tools in their arsenal. My mets were discovered by accident, no pain no symptoms, and treated ASAP with radiation and AI's. My bone met is necrotic and I've been NED for 2+ years. I have no way of knowing what state I'd be in had the mets spread or went undiagnosed until symptoms appeared. I consider myself lucky, but I know in the end, I'll be no luckier than anyone else who is Stage IV. So, what do I think of regular scanning? Once a year does not seem unreasonable if you have no symptoms and yes there is radiation exposure. It's clearly not a black and white issue and nothing is infallible, Rosestoeses, Your dx only appears in your signature line if you choose to make it public. The mods do not control this.",

The \"no rhyme or reason\" comes in to play with trying to predict who will recur or have mets. Yes, one sentinel node should have put me in a better position, but bc cells travel through the bloodstream as well so node negative or few nodes is not a guarantee either. I actually have no complaints except that my life will most likely be shortened. I know what awaits me but keep on keeping on.

I am an elementary school teacher and did take a 3 1/2 month medical leave last year. My mets were discovered during my leave. I had rads to my femur, went on Arimidex and Aredia and went back to work. My employer knew I had bc but I did not tell them I was stage IV and don't intend to until there is a legitimate reason for doing so. By contract I can leave work by 3:15 pm, but like most teachers I rarely do, except on days when I have infusion, scans or doctor's appointments. I have always been able to schedule these late in the day. When I returned to work I tired a bit more easily but what suffered most was my house, not my job! I'm on summer break and have lots of deferred household projects. Wishing you the best. Somehow, we all manage to negotiate this rocky path. Caryn",

If you seek a second opinion outside of the Kaiser system you will not need additional biopsies, mammograms or ultrasounds. You simply have to sign a release and Kaiser will send, or you can hand carry, all slides and films to wherever you are having a second opinion. They do not include their recommendations, just the facts, so the second opinion team can interpret them without any bias. I went to Stanford for my second and their approach (multidisciplinary) was very similar to Kaisers. Stanford was at my own expense. For the record, I have been very impressed with Kaiser so far.- Caryn",

Smaller amounts of additional compensation may be paid for, among other things:  In addition, in some Medical Groups, the excess money that the Medical Group retains, if the basic contractual payments exceed the actual cost of care on a regional basis, also may be used to pay additional compensation to doctors and other personnel As you can see, they are, for the most part on salary. -Caryn",

Our elementary school, P.S. 97 was on the corner and most of us walked home for lunch. We live in semi-attached homes with small backyards. Mine had a steep hill and was a favorite sledding site in the winter. You flew down the hill and crashed into the chain link fence which separated my house from Young Israel of Astor Gardens Synagogue. They were orthodox, we were not, but we attended because it was convenient. I dropped out of Hebrew school after one year but my brother had to go the distance to make his Bar Mitzvah. Most girls did not make Bat Mitzvah back then. I am the oldest of three. My sister, the youngest, passed away 18 months ago from a very aggressive uterine cancer. It has been so hard on my parents and I thought I'd just about kill them with my bc diagnosis. Sound horrible but I hope they pass away before me. Losing another child would kill them. I love the Bronx because of the Yankees, the Bronx Zoo and good Italian food on Arthur Ave. My best friend still lives there. My dad owned a parking garage in Manhattan between Little Italy and Chinatown. It was culinary heaven. I rode the subways and buses everywhere and loved the museums, Broadway and the vibrancy of art and culture. 2. My granddaughter is the best! My older daughter (her mother) and SIL live slightly less than an hour away. My younger daughter sort of lives with me but floats to her fiance's house a lot. She is being married in June and he is a great guy. I was married for 23 years and never felt so happy as when I finally told him to leave. Too much to go into but let's just say a marriage can't be made better by the effort of one. I am extremely close to both my dd's and they are close to each other. Both of them and their mates have been a tremendous support during my bc trials and would do anything to help me. I am so proud to have raised such fine young women and know my little granddaughter will grow to be a fine woman as well. I love them all beyond words. 3.Lived at home during college, ran away and joined the Peace Corps and was sent to Afghanistan. Came back from Afghanistan and became a flight attendant for the late great Pan Am. Traveled the world while based at JFK. Got tired of too many roommates and NYC rents so moved to Houston and commuted to JFK for a while. Got married in Houston and my ex was transferred to Northern CA. Lived in Los Gatos, an upscale Silicon Valley town (still teach there) during my marriage. After my divorce moved to a small townhouse near downtown San Jose. Not upscale or chic but there is a library on the corner and I can still grow some veggies and herbs on my tiny patio. Very happy. 4. Rosh Hashonah? Small family dinner. I am not observant but I make my mothers lukshen kugel which I think is the best. Will post recipe soon. I will take the day off for Yom Kippur so I can say Yizkor for my sister. 5. I LOVE my job! It is like a calling for me. I teach first grade now but started out many, many moons ago teaching ESL in high school. I now know that third grade and below is where I belong. I think I have something to offer the kids but each year, they amaze, entertain and give me more than I could ever give them. I love each one and as long as I feel well, I will work. My school community is great and they were also a tremendous source of support when I was dx last year. Their generosity was overwhelming. Anyway, what would I do around the house all day? 6. I am rarely angry, even with stage IV. I don't know why this is. I am quite a Pollyanna so I suspect this has something to do with it. I am very good at making lemonade when life hands me lemons. Also, Afghanistan was once a beautiful country. I want to bear witness to that fact because there are now so few who remember it that way. My two years there changed me forever and I credit that experience for making me who I am.",

I have gone for more than 6 years with NED status on Arimidex and now letrozole. I can't, and won't, say my bc is reversed or cured because that could change in a minute. I wish I could give you more positive news, but this is the ugly reality. There are some patients, roughly 1-2 %, who don't recur but it's not known why this happens. I live a generally healthy lifestyle, but wouldn't say I do anything alternative . Enjoying everything in moderation makes me happy and happiness is my goal, whether I live ten more days or ten more years. I know you have a young child (I'm a mother, grandmother and first grade teacher) so our personal circumstances are quite different, but enjoy every moment with your child. Remain optimistic, but be realistic as well. There is no known cure for stage IV bc, but new treatments are being develope. Wishing you the best and hoping that you'll be one of the lucky ones . PS: since you are using so alternative therapies as well as conventional, you will probably never know what has helped, but neither Lupron nor letrozole \"reverse\" bc. Lupron itself, is not a bc treatment but it's what allows you to take an aromatase inhibitor, like letrozole, if you are pre-menopausal",

This is not to say that OTC creams won't help, but there is no comparison with respect to level of numbness. I use Aspercreme with Lidocaine for arthritis. Not only does it not numb as well, but the effect doesn't last nearly as long as EMLA. Again, OTC creams may be sufficient, but EMLA IS AMAZING",

Lay down and die, sink into a deep depression, lock myself away in my room? I think not. I simply learn as much as I can about my bc, do the treatments and hope to make it longer than the stats suggest. I am neither brave nor inspiring. Again, I just do what I have to. Survivor? My response to that is a simple, \" Yes, for now.\" I am, however, tolerant of most of these comments as I realize people are coming from a good, if uninformed, place. Those who are close to me know how I feel and don't use these terms. Caryn",

It is hard, even for our loved ones, to understand not only the fact that all cancers are not the same, but that in the world of any given cancer, there may be many different types that respond differently to different treatments.

I can't even figure out what illness some of them are trying to improve/cure. Most end with the statement \"Ask your doctor if XYZ is right for you.\" I imagine all kinds of amusing conversations when someone asks their doctor about a drug they've seen advertised that has nothing to do with them at all! Yes, advertising is about increasing sales and thus profits for the company. Public service is not their main motivation.",

Some people have been upset over the Ibrance ads/commercials that show stage IV women happy and going about their lives while on Ibrance. I realize that these women represent the minority of stage IV women, in terms of looking well and carrying on fairly normally, but, they do represent some of us. I am not on Ibrance, but I can identify with those women. Their lives look like mine. I can relate to them. So, although this is not the way most stage IV women live, it is not untrue for some of us. It would be impossible for a commercial to represent every \"flavor\" of stage IV or to put in a disclaimer so people understand that this is not typical of stage IV, but for some, it is a reality. It's a reality which, I hope, touches more and more of us and a reality which may give hope to others, but within the stage IV community there seems to be some negativity about advertising the fact that some of us are doing well. There is no doubt or illusion that these commercials don't represent the majority of stage IV women and things could turn on a dime for those of us who are doing well but I sometimes feel that as a stage IV minority that I'm not considered a legit part of of things and I need to hide my truth and experience with stage IV bc. I do have MBC and I feel like my experience of living with it for almost 7 years is just as much a part of the MBC community as anyone else's and doesn't detract or distract from those who are having a rough time. I'm ready for the push back, but I don't want to have to apologize for doing well. Bilateral mx 9/7/11 with one step ns reconstruction.

I am ashamed to say that some of my memory from my first year of tx has gone a bit fuzzy.  Here's what I do remember :) - initially, I had a PET scan every 3 months. My mo was looking for any and all mets, not just bone. I now have a PET every six months. - when I started Arimidex, I also started monthly Aredia (bisphosphonate) infusions. I had them monthly for the first year and then every three months for the second year. My mo was a bit concerned about se's with long term use. I have a bit of osteopenia in one hip and take extra calcium. I recently switched to Femara, not because Arimidex failed, but because my se's had increased over the years. - if one AI fails, you may be put on another. Each mo views it differently and, most importantly, takes your particular case as the most important consideration in a new tax plan. Good luck tomorrow! Caryn",

This includes correcting of grammar and spelling (\"You must be stupid for not knowing how to spell XYZ\"), political discussions which have gone so off the rails that it is difficult to believe that any of the posters are adults, posting private info about members of the forum that they don't like and even criticizing others knitting skills. And, don't even get me started on the swearing and non-stop put downs. BTW, those of us who prefer to knit with natural fibers are considered yarn snobs, according to them. The moderators/administrators seem to have abandoned their jobs, so it is actually getting even crazier. I rarely go there anymore, but I still love to knit, so I think I will stick to Ravelry.

I drink two cups in the morning, as I did before bc, and can't imagine giving up such a small but lovely pleasure. I realize that this is only anecdotal, but my sister did everything \"right\" in terms of nutrition and lifestyle for 30 years before she succumbed to an aggressive uterine cancer. She passed away 4 months after her diagnosis. When she would come to a family party, she would relish some of the tasty treats, like a kid in a candy shop. Then she'd go back to her spartan existence. Was it worth it? In the end, an end that came far too quickly, I think even she would have said no. Caryn",

It's certainly not where anyone envisions themselves in their 30's. Young women with mbc are often an unrecognized minority. LoriCA, what inspired this thread was actually a thread on a knitting forum I belong to. I believe it was \"Alice\" who appears to be the proprietor of a yarn store. Knitters sit up and pay attention when we see anything in the media about knitting. The funny thing is that on my knitting forum, many objected to the commercial because they felt that no one, NO ONE, could have mbc and be happy or have a job or any sense of normalcy for that matter. The comments were filled with things like, poor woman, so sad, she is to be pitied, so wrong to show cancer patients that way etc. When I commented that some, but not many, with mbc do have lives like this there was quite a bit of disbelief. One woman asked if, perhaps, I did not understand my dx because no one with mbc lives like that. Umpteen PET scans and bone biopsies have made sure that I understand my dx all too well. I still don't think she believes me! Another commented that I could not have mbc because I was not on IV chemo. I wish!",

Some people have been upset over the Ibrance ads/commercials that show stage IV women happy and going about their lives while on Ibrance. I realize that these women represent the minority of stage IV women, in terms of looking well and carrying on fairly normally, but, they do represent some of us. I am not on Ibrance, but I can identify with those women. Their lives look like mine. I can relate to them. So, although this is not the way most stage IV women live, it is not untrue for some of us. It would be impossible for a commercial to represent every \"flavor\" of stage IV or to put in a disclaimer so people understand that this is not typical of stage IV, but for some, it is a reality. It's a reality which, I hope, touches more and more of us and a reality which may give hope to others, but within the stage IV community there seems to be some negativity about advertising the fact that some of us are doing well. There is no doubt or illusion that these commercials don't represent the majority of stage IV women and things could turn on a dime for those of us who are doing well but I sometimes feel that as a stage IV minority that I'm not considered a legit part of of things and I need to hide my truth and experience with stage IV bc. I do have MBC and I feel like my experience of living with it for almost 7 years is just as much a part of the MBC community as anyone else's and doesn't detract or distract from those who are having a rough time. I'm ready for the push back, but I don't want to have to apologize for doing well. Bilateral mx 9/7/11 with one step ns reconstruction.

Again, a good balanced diet is always helpful. If someone is doing conventional and restrictive diets simultaneously, it becomes impossible to say which causes results. As far as someone who has never had a conventional dx, it's hard for me to give any credence to what they suggest since they may never have had bc to begin with. Miracles? Yes, unexplained things do happen in life but I always mix a large dose of reality in with my hope. For me a restrictive diet that says never eat... Would be sucking the pleasure out of my life, but that's just me. If you're interested, some of the complementary and alternative threads have more information on the more restricted diets. Caryn",

They have a strong emphasis on wellness, prevention and patient education which helps contain costs. My experience has been that if one truly needs care, such as cancer, they don't scrimp.

She received little conventional tax, though did go the conventional route toward the end. She had spent the previous  18-24 months going back and forth to AZ and fundraising to finance her tx. She left two young children behind. I know she would say it was worth it as she was very committed to alt tx, but it makes me sad to think how her time was spent. She was not very forthcoming about all of Dr. Lodi's tx and said she was not free to publicly talk about it (BIG red flag). She eventually stopped posting on bco but I kept up with her on Facebook and she  lived near me as well. She was a beautiful woman who deeply believed she was doing the right thing. Still, I can't help but see it as a bit of a cautionary tale. Caryn",

Do they sometimes cause adverse reaction? No they're not, yes, they do. But, most people in the U.S. Do not remember a time when the diseases that vaccines prevent were common place. Since the majority of children in the U.S. are vaccinated, herd immunity often protects those who are not (though we have begun to see a breakdown of that). So, the argument that \"My child is unvaccinated and is fine\"is not a valid one in my opinion (and now, cannot attend public or private school in CA, unless they have a medical exemption). When I was in the Peace Corps, almost all of the diseases we never see here, were common place. They killed, crippled, disfigured and shortened the lives of many. Why? A largely unvaccinated population. How many of us have ever seen the effects of smallpox, polio etc? Rant over 😉",

As to pain, I can't say it was more or less than the TE route, since I never did that. My pain level was tolerable but I did stay on top of it for the first three weeks, although I got off of the narcotics quickly because I hate them. Advil worked fine and I still had a stash of the narcotics if needed. There don't seem to be a lot of ps's with experience in this area. My ps did only recon, no cosmetic surgery so he was great at it. He did make it clear however that if during the surgery he thought that the one step results didn't look good he would go with TE's. that was the first thing I asked when I woke up! Caryn",

You can't change the past, but a therapist can help you understand how to live with it and not have it color your future.  Yes, no matter how long or short, we do have a future. Perhaps your onc can recommend someone who deals with cancer patients. Although we are all individuals, you are far from the first person to walk this path. As to the raw vegan diet, I can't speak knowledgeably about the diet itself, but if you are not feeling well on it, physically, and it's removed some joy from your life because, let's face it, food is a very pleasurable thing, why keep it up? You can maintain healthy eating habits in a far less restrictive manner. With all due respect to a raw vegan diet, there is little evidence to show that it will cure us.

He has some great mob stories including the morning he came to work and found cops swarming all over his garage. An allegation had been made that a body of a mobster was buried in the basement. Very long story, but no body found. Some trace evidence that something had been there but nothing conclusive.

A bit of the tubing sticks out from the skin. It is covered by a dressing when not in use. It must be cleaned and kept dry. There is a risk of infection. In the US, it is seldom used for chemo, as it's viewed as short term. For instance, people who need IV antibiotics for a couple of days-weeks, often get PICC lines. PICC line insertion is a very minor procedure. Ports are implanted under the skin in a longer surgical procedure, though it is still fairly quick and easy. Once the site has healed it requires no further care, other than flushing which is done after your infusion. Power ports also get a blood return so they can be used for blood draws. Ports can be left in for extended periods of time, years if needed. Please let me know if you need any other info. I have a Bard power port but have never had a PICC line. Also, come visit the stage IV forums. We are a great group ! Caryn",

I had 15 sessions and the mission was successful. I had no skin problems at all but was scrupulous about applying pure aloe vera gel immediately after tx and then Aquaphor later in the day. I don't know how the regimen varies for pain relief.

It is often said here that rads to bone mets is only done for pain management, but that is not the case in all instances. Rads can also render bone mets necrotic. This is not a systemic tx and doesn't prevent mets from cropping up elsewhere, but does reduce the tumor load. My RO and mo felt that since I had limited mets, actually just one, that this was a valuable tx. I think this represents part of the shift of thinking in how stage IV patients are treated. I hope this is a trend that continues as it is moving in the direction of treatment for chronic conditions. It is not a cure and not a solution for everyone but can certainly be effective for some.

I first had it in Japan at a tea ceremony and drank it because I liked it, not because of any health properties. So, what I know about matcha is related to drinking it for pleasure, not health, however it might help those who would like to actually enjoy it as they drink it. Matcha is not infused as most teas are. It is a finely ground powder that is whisked into the hot water. I use a chasen, traditional bamboo whisk, for my tea but am told that an immersion blender works too. Just stirring with a spoon doesn't quite work ,since the matcha doesn't dissolve. You want to whisk it until it's suspended in the water and drink it right away. The taste varies with quality. Buy the best quality you can afford, ceremonial if you can. Traditionally, matcha is not drunk in large quantities, so if you're making a big mug full and using a lot of matcha powder, it can be a pricey habit. I only drink about 1/3-1/2 cup at a time, but again, I don't do this therapeutically. The lower qualities taste \"grassier\" to me and are really made to be used in cooking (think matcha flavored ice cream, mochi, cakes etc. Anyway, I hope this helps with understanding qualities of matcha and how to prepare it. Really good matcha tastes much better than the cooking grade!",

It is a Bard power port and looks like 3 raised dots arranged in a triangle. I use it for blood draws, which I schedule for two days before my infusions. Not only does an RN need to do it but one trained in the procedure and they must have the correct type of needle and heparin/saline to flush it. Because I schedule it in advance, I never run into the issue of the infusion nurses being too busy. As for PET scans, yes they can use the port but the same requirements as for a blood draw must be met. PET scan techs do not, as far as I know, have this training. I did have a major compliction after it was placed, a completely collapsed lung 2 weeks after placement , but that happens 1% of the time. Despite that horrendous episode, I love my power port.

I can understand waiting until after the reunion, since you have no definitive information but depending on your relationship with them and how they've handled learning about your bc thus far, would they be more upset if you withheld information? I am very close to my dd's and although it has been painful for them to hear about my bc, and yes, they worry, they would be more upset if I kept anything from the. I raised them to be open and honest and to understand that family is there for you in good times or bad. Clearly, I have to live by what I taught them. But...this is me and my family dynamic.

By somewhere else in your body, do you mean somewhere else in your breast? Cancer cells travel through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. What you are suggesting sounds like what is called seeding. There is little evidence to support that seeding occurs. Check out this link.

In those few months I read enough on this forum to understand that stage IV was not a single disease nor a swift death sentence. So, although it sent my family into a tizzy I just focused on a treatment plan and getting my life back to as normal as possible. I have made an effort to get things in order (which is good for anyone to do). Didn't work over the summer. Did a lot of delayed house projects and garage cleaning. I also finally found the time to reflect on what bc has brought to me and what I want to do going forward. I don't want to stop working as it is my passion and a true calling and am lucky that I feel very good so I can. Basically, I want to carry on as if I didn't have bc because I know a day will come when I can't. And that's pretty much where I'm at right now. I have just decided I will live normally until I can't. I have made an odd peace with the fact that I know what I will die from this but don't dwell on it since no one knows when that will be. One of my colleagues was very teary eyed when she heard about my bc (I actually had to comfort her!). I looked at her and said, \"I am not dying yet. Until then I will keep living.\" Caryn",

Well written, my friend!  When my bone met was first discovered ( no pain or symptoms) I discussed tx with my primary and second opinion mo's. We spoke of the pros and cons of chemo vs. AI's.  Clearly, the chemo would have represented the possibility of curative intent. But, 1-2% are cured? That isn't even statistically significant in my mind. That wasn't enough to justify the possible decrease in QOL if the overwhelming odds were against it working as a cure anyway. Both mo's thought either choice that I made would be reasonable. I went with the AI's and have been NED for 3 years. I also had radiation to my bone met. I have not had an AI fail but I did switch a few months ago due to increased se's from my original AI. Additionally, when I exhaust the AI's there have been some studies that indicate chemo having a better effect on a body that is chemo naive. My life has been, essentially, normal. Work, family, travel etc. continue to give me great joy and fulfillment. Currently, stage IV is incurable because, as I said, 1-2% cure rate is more an anomaly than anything else, particularly when it's not understood how that cure is even achieved. I would look at a doctor who told me stage IV was curable, like he was crazy. It would be like saying I was a successful teacher but only 1-2% of my students had learned to read. I don't know if there will be a cure in my lifetime, though I hope so. I can handle chronic and never ending tx as long as I have a good QOL. Although I think about bc everyday, it doesn't consume me. I won't let bc rob me of a minute of my life until it absolutely has to and living as best as I can despite stage IV is how I cope. I can't use the idea of possible cure as something to hang my hat on because it doesn't seem close enough, but chronic is good enough for now. Take good care of yourself. Caryn",

Are these stats absolute? No, some who have a low chance of recurrence will recur and some who have a high chance won't. If you applied the 50/50 model to everyday life you can see why it's not accurate i.e. 50% chance of being in a car accident every time you drive, 50% chance of getting food poisoning every time you eat etc. Barbe, I know you believe this and I agree that there seems to be no rhyme or reason behind some recurrences, but it's just not a statistical reality.

If some people have these amazing all natural cures, let's have those folks get it together and do the studies/trials needed to prove it. However, if dietary changes make you feel good, then pursue them but if they create further stress and worry (i.e. That you ate something wrong, that you can't socialize normally etc) then they may not be worth it. ibcmets, I too would have been upset if my mo said stage IV is curable. Curable for who? The tiny % who manage to beat it but no one really knows why? That doesn't meet the definition of cure in my mind. I want hope, but not false hope.",

My mo feels, since I am doing well, that she'd like to go to yearly to minimize what she feels will be years of scans and it's radiation exposure. Not sure if I'm ready to go annual. Logically, it makes sense but emotionally I can't be that cut and dried. In my 6 years, I've had a LOT of radiation And I know I don't need any extra. It is often said that discovering mets early does not change or extend lifespan. You just know about it and receive tx earlier (often with se's that aren't fun). I cannot swear this to be fact as I have no citation but will try to find a source. Sadly, very few with mets live out a normal lifespan, regardless of whether the mets were found early or not.",

It was emphasized that you get half your genes from your mother and half from your father and since bc is not a gender specific disease, your father's family medical history is important. What is more important is to remember is that with what is currently known, not all cancers are linked to BRCA when one is looking at hereditary factors. For example your family can have a long history of uterine cancer but that would not be linked to BRCA but ovarian cancer would be. Ethnicity can play a role as well and for those family members with bc, age of disease onset is relevant. Good luck to you. Caryn",

Statistics cannot predict with absolute certainty how you, as an individual, will do and shouldn't be interpreted as such. A good example is lung puncture during port insertion. Statistics say there is a 1% chance of this happening when performed by an experienced surgeon. Well, it happened to me!

At this point in time, we have no way of knowing. Speculating, based on those who post on bco, is of limited value for me because message boards represent only a small sampling of those with bc. I know it seems like there are a lot of us, but people who post on message boards are not a valid sampling for statisical purposes. Barbe, I'm sure I was one who quibbled with your 100% or 0% statement. Survival stats are not a predictor of how an individual will do, and should never be interpreted as such. They are based on historical data and have no individual predictive value. It's baffles me when people get upset if they fall outside a positive looking stat. Yes, you may have a 90% survival rate if you do treatment xyz, and that's quite good. But someone will fall into the 10% that doesn't survive, and sadly, it may any one of us. Many of you know that I experienced a collapsed lung after port installation. The statistical incidence of that is 1%. My chance was 1% just like everyone else, however my reality was that I fell into that 1%. That doesn't change the overall odds, because they never predict individual outcomes. Statistics don't tell the stories of individuals. I understand and accept their limitations and never, ever mistake them for anything more. I am sitting in the Denver airport dealing with a 2 hour flight delay due to high winds in San Francisco. Wonder what the chances of that were? 😉",

Call your docs office right now and ask them to explain, in detail, exactly how SNB will happen including anesthesia, after care etc. These are the kinds of things you need to ask before every procedure, test etc. Taking control will go a long way toward alleviating your anxiety. You are just as much a member of your care team as any doctor. As a matter of fact, you are the team leader! Go out and buy an expanding file and use it to file and save everything relating to your bc especially test results and path reports. Again, taking charge will not only give you a greater sense of control, but will give you something positive to do.I also want to confirm that IDC is invasive and the I can stand for invasive or infiltrating. Bc is not welcome news for anyone but it is your situation to take charge of so you don't let it victimize you. Lots of good thoughts and prayers for you. Caryn",

My older dd and granddaughter joined me in the NY/NJ area for a week. We stayed with my father, spent a special day at American Girl Place in NYC. We spent time with my brother and his family, swam, shopped and ate too much! My father adored Frankie and they got along famously. I stayed on after they left and spent most of my time dealing with my father's declining health, particularly his mental/emotional decline (he is 88). It was very hard to witness and I hated having to treat him like a child at times, but that's the reality. My brother and I are at a crossroads about his ongoing care, although we are unified in our decision making processes. On a happier note, I received this photo after Frankie returned to CA. The small,stuffed pug is Cookie. The doll is an American Girl Bitty Baby, named Ellie and then there is Miles. He was propped up on the sofa and looks completely puzzled by the whole thing! ",

I do want to clarify my diet comment since it makes me sound like a gluttonous lush. I have always been mindful of what I eat and, without going to extremes, eat a balanced diet. There is nothing on my \"never eat\" list. For instance, if I'm at a county fair and I'm seduced by a corn dog, I'll eat one but that will probably be the only one I eat for another couple of years. I probably have a glass of wine once a week and 3-4 martinis a year. I enjoy every bite/sip and never feel a bit of guilt. For me, more happy, less worry is the key. And if it isn't, I will at least have spent my last years on earth enjoying life to the fullest. Caryn",

I was never much of a drinker but did imbibe on special occasions but stopped even that since being diagnosed. Anyway, I had, perhaps, a half glass of champagne and a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon.

My school district and the staff at my site have been great but I didn't feel there was any reason for them to know. I do my job as I always have. All of my family knows as do close friends. My daughters (22 and 28) feel comfortable with the choice I've made and don't feel as if they are keeping a secret. When people ask how I am, and they say fine, they are not lying since I am doing very well. Not telling the nitty gritty details is not a lie, in my opinion. If someone were to press me or my dd's for details, I would have no problem with telling. However, you and your son need to talk about it and come to some sort of an agreement.

Meg101, Most people have no issues with their ports. I myself had the rarest of complications, a collapsed lung, but realize that while possible, it's highly unlikely. I would still recommend a port. PICC lines are less commonly used in the US due to the fact that they are \"open\" and involve restrictions on getting wet. You do see them for shorter term use, i.e. antibiotics that must be given intravenously for a few weeks. Once you have healed from the port installation, for most people a short easy process, the port is care free. Do some folks have problems? Of course, but they are in the minority (and I was one of them!). Let's not forget that Power Ports also allow for blood draws and nuclear injections if you get PET scans.",

Whether you wanted them or not, you will not be getting any more cancer free years. However, it is quite likely that you will still be getting quite a few years or maybe even more than that. Yes, you will be receiving some type of tx forever, but you can have a life that is fulfilling and happy. Perhaps, not the life you planned, but you get to decide what to do with the life you've been given. I don't think I am particularly strong, and certainly not brave, I'm just doing the best I can under imperfect circumstances. Personally, I don't believe there is a miracle cure. Lots of good stories but no miracles that have been proven. I will try to be as healthy as possible, but I will enjoy food and drink as it pleases me. I will not spend my time choking down stuff that doesn't give me pleasure or allow me the splendid social opportunities of shared meals, nor will I spend excessive amounts of time preparing food for restrictive diets. The only place coffee will enter my body is through my mouth! Now, here's the big one...I will not allow depression or obsession over finding a miracle steal my time and enjoyment of life. I know you are not keen on therapy/psychs or meds, but they can lift the veil of darkness, whether you live for only one year or fifty. I will not ask you why you are so opposed to this (psych/meds) as I'm sure you have your reasons but know, that many of us have availed ourselves of this and it 's made a world of difference. It does not dull you or make you zombie like. You sound very depressed and that's not any way to live, bc or not. Just my thoughts and I apologize in advance if I upset you. Fondly, Caryn",

Im sorry that Terri did pass on with your information, no one was trying to cause any issues.

Please feel free to share with everyone on the chat line he is doing well and because of Terri making the right decision, he has a forever retirement home and is very happy.

If I so much have an extra swallow of morning coffee, I can barely make it to morning recess. This calculation also takes into account occasional yard duty during morning recess, a real nightmare! This also results in me drinking most of my daily water intake in the evening, which of course, makes me have to wake up at least once during the night to pee! Caryn",

When something new crops up, like bc, they really have no framework for understanding so they fit it into what the do know. Sickness, to them is a cold or a tummy ache. They know that germs for these illnesses can be passed around, so that's the only perspective they have on illness. I am an elementary school teacher and a mom. I have seen kids come to all kinds of interesting conclusions on illness, death, divorce etc. It's endlessly fascinating, sometimes funny, sometimes sad. That's why telling them the truth, in an age appropriate way, is so important. Caryn",

Then she said why teach children to get along if adults can't get along, have a civil conversation, agree to disagree etc. She really, really doesn't get it. I wrote her back and told her politely, but unequivocally how I felt, particularly that regardless of how much she read and studied she clearly knew nothing about bc and even less about stage IV cancer. I ended by telling her that I sincerely hoped she never would have to really learn about these things. Happily, I have heard nothing further from her. Caryn",

I think it's also important to thoroughly enjoy the not so healthy stuff once in a while and feel absolutely no guilt about it. I figure the guilt may be more harmful than the food you ate, and the pleasure you derived from eating it can only help. I was at a party in a bar last night. The bar is know for it's hand crafted drinks made with local, organic ingredients (California is a funny place!). I enjoyed a delicious gin, cucumber and St. Germain cocktail and split a hand thrown arugula Parmesan pizza with a friend. I savored each sip and bite, chatted with lots of people and went home feeling happy and stress free. That is very healthy in my book! On a more serious note, as many of us have often written, overall healthy eating and lifestyle is good for all. Do the best you can, make healthy changes that you can live with and don't stress over either a restrictive diet or small lapses in a reasonable one.",

I think the OP was looking at stage IV and miracle cures or remisions not necessarily connected to religious beliefs.I am so sorry that you lost your mother to bc but lack of medical care neither encouraged nor discouraged your bc. Additionally, the number of bc's that are genetic are very small for the known mutations. Your timing in getting a mammogram was just fortuitious. Results that one gets after a biopsy do sometimes differ from the path report after surgery.  Again,you are very fortunate in that yours turned out to be less agressive.I am on Arimidex too and have very few se's, even though I didn't petition G-d. Maybe we did miss your point but this is the stage IV forum and our perspective is often very different from those with stage I. May you continue to enjoy good health.",

Clearly, the child knew something was up and it manifested itself as stomaches at school. Not the same as cancer, but you get the idea.

To me, what it does is hold out a glimmer of hope for the future as more is learned about the peculiar state of oligomets. My parents have suggested a third opinion too but I am pretty burned out on doctor appts. at the moment. My DD and SIL, who are about to make me a grandmother, live within spitting distance of UCSF. Ann, I am not, by nature, a risk taker. Yes, I did join the Peace Corps more than 30 years ago and no one believed I would stick it out but I did. However, I am stubborn and when I make a decision I am tenacious. It's the lack of research and the doubt by some oncs that oligomets even exist that creates a doubt about which way I should go. Also, I know that someday my little baby met will be all grown up and produce some nasty little spawn and I'll end up doing chemo eventually. If I do it now, it will be ACT (4 AC, 12 T). Where is my magic decision fairy? Caryn",

After all, I'm the one taking the risk so the options are mine not theirs.The odds of \"cure\" are very small and there isn't a lot of data. My life is so completely normal right now that I don't know if it's worth changing tx for the very small chance of cure. I teach first grade and can't imagine having the energy to do this during chemo not to mention what 26 kids would do to a compromised immune system. I am having a PET next week and right now, if I show no progression, am inclined to stay with current tx. If I have progressed, then I'd have to see about chemo. Caryn",

I am also on Effexor and Ativan.Went back to work 5 weeks ago and am thrilled to be back. I have gone to Stanford, twice, for second opinions. My Stanford MO and my Kaiser MO know each other and consult easily. The Stanford MO brought up the possibility of doing chemo with curative intent. This is based on a 1996 study of women with limited metastaic bc. The study involved 1,581 subjects of different ages, menopausal status, ER status and area of mets. A small percentage of the subjects, across the board, achieved complete remission. I am currently wading through the study to pick out what percentage of those women most closely resemble me. My Kaiser MO said she would be willing to give it a go, using ACT, but it was up to me. She said and Stanford doc agrees, that there is no clear \" right\" choice. So, do I continue along a tx path that regards my disease as a chronic condition or do I gamble, with poor odds, on going for an initially harsher tx that may, or may not, pay off in the long run. I have a PET scheduled for next Weds. but my MO doesn't think it will provide ant major info to factor into my decision, unless I've had progression, which she doubts. I really value all input especially stage IV sisters since you all understand the emotional component of this.

Your prognosis is very good and although there are the unknowns, chances are very good that you will be fine.

Should you ever need another biopsy, your previous allergic reaction to titanium will clearly make using another marker out of the question. Again, I am so sorry that this happened to you, but it is a very rare situation. I wish things could be foolproof when it come to medical tx, but that's not our reality.

This is not to say I do nothing about my bc, but beyond doing what I'm comfortable with, I let the rest go. I know bc will rob me of tomorrow, someday, but I refuse to let it rob me of today. I eat reasonably and don't fret about a cookie if I want one. I don't spend time on restrictive diets. I do take some supplements but do so for overall health, not because I think it will cure me. I am 57 and have had a good life. I have a job I love, two fabulous daughters and a sweet granddaughter. I have traveled extensively, and still do when the bank acct. allows. Of course, I have had the usual ups and downs (23 years of a crappy marriage), just lost my mother, lost my younger sister 3 years ago etc. I don't want to die any sooner than I have to, but I am at peace with my life. Yes, I did see a psych. My HMO refers cancer patients to a guy who specializes in those with cancer. I liked talking with him and I have been on Effexor since the beginning of this weird trip. I still feel totally like me and see no reason not to take it. Fear? Fear can be crippling and would rob me of the here and now. Musiclover, your dx is still relatively new but if your fear is taking away from your QOL, talking to someone might help, even without meds. Caryn",

There simply is no direct cause and effect known at this time. Focus on what you can do now to stay as healthy as possible. Wishing you the best. Caryn",

Some have said, when being dx at stage IV, that their oncs were being aggressive and going for a cure. When that cure happens only 1-2% of the time, regardless of how aggressive tx is, is that giving false hope? Is an mo who does not aim for a cure at stage IV giving up, as some have suggested? I read the blog of a stage IV woman who said it is untrue that stage IV is incurable. Well technically, she was right , even if the cure rate is minuscule. As for me, a naturally optimistic person, I don't think 1-2% represents curable. My optimism is well tempered by reality. I would love to be among that 1-2%, but I would have thought my doctor to be giving me false hope if she said cure was possible at stage IV. 1-2 % is just too tiny to pin ones hopes on (but I'll happily take it if it comes :) Caryn",

Get all of your test results, films etc. and get a second opinion. I have had rads to my bone met, Aredia for 2 years and have been on an AI for almost 4 years. Yes, I have joint aches and stiffness, related to the AI, but I remain NED and have found ways to mitigate the se's. I also have never read that bc is commonly misdiagnosed and that 44% of the time the woman has no cancer at all. What's your source? Take care",

A cornerstone of their healthcare philosophy is a proactive patient/doctor relationship coupled with a strong emphasis on wellness. They want you to be an active part of the treatment and strongly encourage you to be fully informed. Of course,I am sure they treat folks who don't want to know or be active in tx decisions. This makes me think of my mom who was having severe back pain recently.

While not common, port infections can happen and that is a known possibility (infection rates with PICC lines are higher than with ports). In the spirit of full disclosure, I had the ultimate rare port complication happen; a collapsed lung. it's a long story but suffice to say not a pretty one. Still, it is so rare that I would never recommend against a port. Anytime you insert a foreign object in your body there is some risk, no matter how small. But I don't want my story to cause women worry or decide not to get ports. I just fell into the unlucky 1% who have this complication.If you're looking for a medical procedure with 0% risk, it's unlikely you'll find any. The vast majority have ports inserted, used and removed without complications.",

Here is what my genetic counselor and genetic psychologist did for me: - determined if I fell into a group at risk for BRCA mutations - set me up with an online class on BRCA mutations that explained what they were/were not and helped me understand what questions and options would need to be explored if I tested positive. Also, explained the implications for family members - provided post-test support and explained the lengthy results data from Myriad I really appreciated the information and support.

Clearly you understand that for us, this journey, weird trip or whatever we call it will only end one way. Yes, you are right that people don't understand bc in general but, as you will discover, mbc is even less well understood. I know you are just recovering from surgery but when you feel up to it, check out the threads on the stage IV forum that deal with your specific mets. Stage IV stinks but we are a great group!",

Grade/aggressiveness is but one aspect of the tumor. In and of itself, it may not be the only factor in determining the potential effectiveness of chemo. Other tumor characteristics may play a role in the efficacy of chemo. I think that this is quite an advance in that tumors are being analyzed for their particular characteristics rather just grade/size which seems somewhat limiting. TN's do not respond to hormonals as others have stated, so oncotype, which assumes use of hormonals currently has no value for them. Very interesting discussion! Caryn",

She posted a link to natural news, an article by Mike Adams( the health ranger) calling mammograms a medical hoax. Additionally she spouted some barely informed info about how doctors are urging women to cut their breasts off because of \"some gene\". I challenged her on this, acknowledging that mammos are not perfect and that some doctors order the BRCA test without genetic counseling, but overall the medical profession has many, many caring and competent practitioners. She came back with some story about aspartame and macular degeneration and a story about a chef who cured herself with diet alone. When I asked if the chef could share this diet with others, so it could be replicated and studied there was no reply. When I asked if those who are big pharma get cancer or if their loved ones get cancer, no reply. Here is the kicker, she has no health insurance so gets no medical care or screenings. She surmises that perhaps this is why she is so healthy! i.e. traditional medicine has not \"found\" a disease to cure in her with their treatments and meds that do more harm than good. There was also a lot about what she has read over the years about breast cancer and other aspects of traditional medicine. Really? Really? You are saying this to a stage IV bc patient who has, not voluntarily, become all too well informed about bc. Sheesh! Caryn",

I can easily wear tank tops, deep scoop necks, v- necks etc. I use it not only for infusions, but PET scans and all blood draws. I have no problem, and it takes no time, to have my blood drawn at the infusion center ( they send it to the lab). Yes, you can leave it in indefinitely if you have it flushed every 4-6 weeks. Since we are all stage IV, I figure we probably have very good reason to leave it in, and certainly a good reason to get one. It really is my very good friend. I do have EMLA cream but my center uses a very effective numbing spray so I just go with that. Good luck with your decision. Caryn P.S. I am the 1% who had a lung puncture at port insertion.

I don't know how many attorneys you have consulted, but if if several feel that you don't have a case, then all of this may fall into the category of the risk we all assume with medical procedures and the side effects and risks that occur with them. Malpractice and/or negligence are very different from that. For instance, when a port is installed, there is a 1% chance of lung puncture. An x-ray is taken after the procedure to verify that this has not happened. I had all of this done but two weeks after the procedure, it was discovered that I had a complete collapse of one lung. How did this happen? Well, my lung was nicked and it created something like a slow leak on a tire. It was not visible on the post procedure x-ray. Fixing it involved a wild dash to the ER, the painful insertion of a chest tube, 6 days in the hospital with two more chest tube insertions and another month at home with a portable chest tube. Horrible as it was, these were all possible risks of port installation. No one to really blame. However, I do hope you have written letters of complaint to all of the doctors and facilities involved. Take care.",

As an educator, mother and someone with bc, I can say that you have given your children the tools to cope with a very scary situation. This goes for much younger children as well. They should always be told the truth, on an age appropriate level and all all efforts should be made to inform their school as well. Pointvalue, Please check your library. There are many good books about speaking to children about a parent's illness or surgery. The Ameican Cancer Society also hassome good info on speaking to children.

Whether I call it IIB with metastasis or just stage IV, really makes no difference as one cannot go back to not having mets, even if one as been NED for years (6 years in my case). May I ask why you are hesitant to tell your adult children? My children were about the same age when I was dx'ed. They would have been more upset if I had kept it from them. They have educated themselves about MBC and have been a great source of support. It has also helped them, and myself, realize that we must bring mbc out of the dark and not speak of it in embarrassed whispers if we want people to understand this disease and to encourage research for a cure. We may not be the pretty pink arm of bc, but we need to come out in to the light. I understand that your choice is a personal one, and I am not judging, just curious. Take care",

Yes, it still shows up on PET scans but is not active. As for stage at initial dx, that is based on info available at the time. In my case, after my bmx, I was staged IIb. Less than 6 weeks later, before I even had a chance to begin chemo, my bone met was found through an unrelated test. No pain, no symptoms. Had it not been for that unrelated scan, we would have believed I was IIb until I became symptomatic. So, I believe I was stage IV from the start but if the met hadn't been accidentally found we would have happily assumed I was IIb until some future time. Would I have then said I was IIb for xx years until I had bone met symptoms?  I think my point is that NED is a general term which simply means no current evidence of disease but means little in terms of how much or how little time when stays that way or whether one looks at a period after a lower stage dx as anything meaningful. It simply refers to your current state. Caryn",

I was IIB after surgery and less than 3 months later, stage IV. Never saw stage III but suspect my bone met was there all along and if you remember my story, discovered by accident. No pain or any other symptoms. I have been fortunate in that I have tolerated Arimidex, Aredia and rads to my bone met very well.

I think the generic is available too as lidocaine/prilocaine. It must be applied about 1 hour before the procedure and covered with an occlusive dressing. I have written about it on a few other threads as I have used it over the years for several procedure involving needle sticks. I am a huge fan and no, I don't work for the manufacturer :) Best wishes for an easy recovery. Caryn",

I had a bmx with immediate 1one step reconstruction and had only 1 drain on each side. I couldn't shower with them and they came out after 10 days. Some women are allowed to shower with them and have them removed sooner or later than I did. How much fluid you put out determines that.

I can say that the teen years were my least favorite times :) I know that (after you wring his neck!) you will do whatever is necessary, in terms of counseling and services to get him back on track and hold him responsible for his behavior. As my mother would have said, \" You need this like a hole in the head.\" Love, Caryn",

Second surgery on 10/13/11 to remove spared nipple due to more DCIS. Port installed at same time. Two weeks later, PET scan finds collapsed right lung thought to be result of tiny nick during port installation which resulted in what was essentially a slow leak.

Final path report showed dcis too close to one nipple and 1 positive node. Scheduled surgery to have nipple removed and port installed simultaneously. During recovery mo wanted to enroll me in phase III clinical trial. This required echo cardiogram. Some fluid found around my heart so PET was ordered. PET discovers completely collapsed right lung thought to be as a result of tiny nick during port placement which caused a slow leak. Rushed to ER, hospitalized for 6 days. MO also notes PET found spot on upper femur. MRI done but inconclusive. After healing from lung issue, I had a bone biopsy. Bingo! 2 cm bone met. No pain, no symptoms. Soooo, if I had never had the echo which led to the PET the bone met might not have been found until it became symptomic and possibly more widespread. Not to mention the collapsed lung which presented with atypical symptoms. Things have gone much more smoothly since then. Last PET was clear and I went back to work in Jan. of this year. I'm a teacher so am currently enjoying summer vacation, but am looking forward to a new school year in late August. Caryn",

This implies that if you have se's, you and/or your medical team are not doing something to prevent it. The truth is that despite all efforts, medical, physical, emotional or spiritual, some people will have se's. These will range from mild to intolerable.

The original designation is based on your genitalia, at birth, but as we know, people don't always feel that they match the gender of their genitals. When one loses a physical part that identified with a specific gender, i.e. Breasts on a women, does that change ones gender identity? For many, I would guess no, since one would have many years to identify as a woman and still feel like one despite the loss of breasts. For others that might not be true and I'm sure many of us have wrestled with how it effects our own image of what femininity is. Sexuality has to do with having sexual feelings.Whether we act on those feelings with members of the opposite gender, same gender, with our own hands or not at all is how that sexuality manifests itself. BC and all that is done to us in order to stave it off can clearly effect both gender identification and sexuality. Caryn",

Not every stage IV is out conquering the world! Talk to your mo about your desire to travel so you can find out what accommodations can be made in terms of your tx Start small; A long weekend perhaps? In the US you can get travel insurance that covers pre-existing conditions. I have used a Travel Guard in the past. Wherever you go, plan to take it easy and build some rest time into each day. If you feel up to it, you can always add more activities. I don\u2019t know what your immediate medical needs may be, but I wasn\u2019t too concerned about knowing where hospitals and doctors were. I had gotten cleared to travel by my mo, so I just worked on the premise that any medical emergencies that might crop up would be handled like a medical emergency that anyone could have when traveling. I have traveled quite a bit since my stage IV dx, both domestically and internationally. Happy to answer any questions you might have!",

However, in making informed treatment decisions, data does provide a rational jumping off point for me and many others. I realize that scientific data and research are not important to some. Of course no one can say that they have followed proven tx, conventional, and that they have received all the benefits. None of the conventional treatments promise anything but you know that going in to it. If treatment XYZ has data that says 75% of those who follow it will be cured, you have to understand that 25% won't be. Additionally, you have no way of knowing which side you will fall on, but at least you know that when you are in the decision making process. I'd like to see the same for alt tx. Just the way my brain works 😊. I need double blind, randomized, replicable data. I'm an academic through and through (by nature and profession).  Lily, I'm going to try to read the Moss report again.

I still felt very feminine and maintained my sexuality. At age 55, I had a bmx with one step reconstruction and shortly after that a bone met was found and I went on Arimidex.

I am somewhat less concerned about how/why I got bc, as it's water under the bridge for me. The only value , if the answer were known, might be in helping others. I hope you will forgive my frankness here and this, of course is simply my opinion: \"The Secret\",  thinking only good thoughts will cure us or get us what we want? Magical thinking of the highest order. Bruce Lipton; we assume our parents diseases by thinking we will get them? That's some major bs. If we say we don't want something, we will get it? This is so absurd to me that I can't even comment. Our bc is not due to mistakes we made or things we did \"wrong\". I think it is more likely the perfect storm of many factors. I believe I did nothing \"wrong\" and have never once blamed myself or tried to pinpoint what exactly caused my bc. As for G-d, since beliefs in G-d vary widely and since those who are atheists as well as devout believers get bc, I'm leaving that out of the equation. As for children getting cancer, whether one believes in G-d or not, no one was promised a perfect life and sadly, that includes children.  Musiclover, I'm not knocking your beliefs or search for answers, simply expressing my own on the subject. I am 2 1/2 years out from my stage IV dx and by choice, as well as personality, live each day as normally and happily as possible. For me, all that worry about perfect diet, why I got cancer, positive attitude etc. would be emotionally draining, energy wasting and suck the joy out of whatever time I have left. I hope you find peace and spend your time doing what brings happiness. Caryn",

Breast cancer is not a disease that is commonly misdiagnosed on the side of false positives. But, you need to do whatever it takes you give you confidence in the validity of your dx and treatment and understand that you can have this disease without a single symptom, even at stage IV.

Clean vs. unclean, in my mind, had different meaning in biblical times than it does today. For instance, there was probably little concern about polluted waters. Why shellfish were considered unclean, at the time, is unclear and I'm willing to bet that ten rabbis might give you ten different reasons. The concept of kosher is important as a continuity of tradition, with some of the original health concerns no longer being valid. I should say that I do not keep kosher but my house is kosher style, because of the way I grew up. For instance, if a pork chop or ham appeared in my fridge, I'd have no idea what to do with them.I also don't mix dairy with meat.",

I am on Arimidex and am just about to stop Aredia, a bisphosphonate like Zometa, after 2 years. The bone strengtheners, by themselves, are not really a tx for bc. There was some initial evidence that they were helpful in slowing bc spread in the bones, but this hasn't really panned out. Most women take it in conjunction with one of the hormonals but not as a stand alone tx. As far as chemo goes, my understanding is that their effectiveness is a very individual thing. Your previous chemos may have not been effective but that doesn't mean Xeloda won't be. As you can see, my knowledge here is limited but I know someone with more experience will be along soon.

Yes, the expenses can be great but by going to community colleges first and then state schools, you can mitigate super high tuitions. The ivy leagues are just outrageous but do provide a great education. Expectations at a high school level and at home are important too. My ex and I graduated from high school about the same time. He lived in a small town in Ohio where only a few people in his class went on to college. They had no counselors to encourage them or talk about financial aid. Most families in the area assumed that if you couldn't pay for it outright, you couldn't go. I grew up in NYC. We had dedicated college counselors who were experts in helping you get into the city or state college system and private universities as well. From early childhood, it never occurred to me not to go to college. My parents and everyone I knew made it clear that education didn't end with high school. To this day, learning anything new is a joy to me! Now, it is quite true that some people may not be on this path but as mrs. devine points out, they generally require some training beyond high school. Those factories and mills that once provided a living wage are no longer a big part of the 21sf century economy. I live in an interesting neighborhood in terms of ethnic demographic and parental expectations. The population is largely Southeast Asian and Mexican. Children are cherished by both of these cultures, however the push for higher education is very strong in the Southeast Asian community but less strong in the Hispanic community. This is not racism or prejudice but statistically confirmed by high school graduation rates and college enrollment. So the expectations of ones family play a big part in this. I'll leave you with one funny joke. As you may know, starting in the early 20th century and continuing until after WWII, there was a huge migration of Eastern European Jews to the US. Learning, first in the religious sense and then in the secular sense, has been a cornerstone of Jewish culture. So the joke goes, What's a Jewish failure? Answer; Someone with a bachelor's degree. Yes, a broad generalization but an indication of how cultural and family expectations influence how higher education is viewed. Caryn",

One thing that seems important, to me, is dealing with those feelings but then learning how to enjoy life despite bc. I just hit the 6 year mark and am as happy and fulfilled as anyone with stage IV can be. I did not know I would live 6 years beyond my dx and have no idea how much longer I've got but am so glad I let go of what I couldn't control and chose to seek happiness (even if it was not what I imagined my life would be like).

Malpractice is not an easy thing to prove and is very different from being unhappy with the results of a procedure (even if they are aesthetically bad). Take care of your immediate situation and I hope you are pain free and in a better emotional place very soon.",

For all of us and especially for those with greater anxiety, I hope he/she will be forthright about your situation but caring and sensitive in how you are spoken to. My diagnosis happened a bit differently as I met with a multi-disciplinary team after all films and biopsies had been done. As for what to expect, I imagine (and this is not medical certainty, just speculation based on what I know!) the doctor will review all of your mammos and ultrasounds and any other information obtained during previous doctor visits. I am certain you will be physically examined (palpation). I don't know that anyone can tell that a lump is malignant just by touching it. At that point the doctor may recommend a biopsy. If not, and you still feel it's warranted, please speak up and tell your doctor what your concerns are. As for your wedding, congratulations! Even if you need a biopsy, I'm betting that if can be put off until after the wedding. If you've been reading these forums you'll notice that quite often many weeks elapse between the first \"bad\" mammo or lump finding and a biopsy. I would also be very frank with the doctor about your high anxiety level. It will be OK. If you have BC, then you can begin to develop a plan for treatment if not, then you can enjoy being a newly wed! -Caryn     PS: This is just my opinion on what MIGHT happen. Please don't read anything in to your doctor's behavior if it goes differently.",

To help you understand the implications of a positive result and the choices you may be facing, if you are positive, I reccommend that you find a center that offers not just the test (which is a simple blood draw) but genetic counseling. Call your primary care pysician or ob/gyn for a referral to a genetic counselor. I had the BRCA test after my bc diagnosis due to familiy history and ethnicity but had to go through genetic counseling and take an on-line class on the BRCA test and all it's implications. I was negative but it was good to know what it all really meant as I have two daughters and a granddaughter. Wishing you the best. Caryn",

Yes, I know this was produced by Pfizer, and yes, I know they are not the majority of MBC patients, but it validated my feelings and my attitude toward life. One woman mentioned that she knows that she is not typical, and I acknowledge that as well. And one women, Jill Cohen, reminded so very much of my younger sister, who passed away at age 50 after a 4 month battle with uterine cancer. Ms. Cohen was originally from the Bronx, as we were, and my sister's name was also Jill. I have, sometimes, felt that I wasn't stage IV enough for bco (must have something to do with the expletive laced pm's ), though not from the majority of members. I have a great life, but I do have MBC and I appreciate those who understand this and know I need support as well. Thank you and may everyone have a restful weekend.\" http://www.storyhalftold.com/  MBC is varied and complex, yet ultimately, we will all meet the same fate",

Nothing is added to make it creamy but you can sweeten veggies by adding things like carrots or apples which add a bit of natural sweetness. I also usually add lemon juice and fresh ginger. I really like veggies and just throw in whatever in season organic produce I find at the farmers market. Broccoli, kale and bok choy are some of my favorites.

I am also on Effexor and Ativan.Went back to work 5 weeks ago and am thrilled to be back. I have gone to Stanford, twice, for second opinions. My Stanford MO and my Kaiser MO know each other and consult easily. The Stanford MO brought up the possibility of doing chemo with curative intent. This is based on a 1996 study of women with limited metastaic bc. The study involved 1,581 subjects of different ages, menopausal status, ER status and area of mets. A small percentage of the subjects, across the board, achieved complete remission. I am currently wading through the study to pick out what percentage of those women most closely resemble me. My Kaiser MO said she would be willing to give it a go, using ACT, but it was up to me. She said and Stanford doc agrees, that there is no clear \" right\" choice. So, do I continue along a tx path that regards my disease as a chronic condition or do I gamble, with poor odds, on going for an initially harsher tx that may, or may not, pay off in the long run. I have a PET scheduled for next Weds. but my MO doesn't think it will provide ant major info to factor into my decision, unless I've had progression, which she doubts.

Aromatase inhibitors, such as Aromasin, Femara and Arimidex are generally used for post-menopausal, ER+ patients. Tamoxifen for those who are pre-menopausal, though there are no rules set in stone. It is also very common to use these drugs in conjunction with a bisphosphonate such as Aredia or Zometa . Ask about that as well as better pain relief. Wishing you the best. Caryn",

Women who have breast cancer have lived, super healthy lifestyles, moderate lifestyles and dreadful ones. Neither diet nor exercise, yoga, meditation or religion is guarantee of protection from bc. So don't spend another moment going down that path. I think about the fact that I have stage IV bc everyday, it is always there. Sometimes it is a dark shadow, sometimes I am proud. Yes, proud! As in times when I do something that you wouldn't think a stage IV person could do. However, the thought of bc does not stop me from happily carrying on with the rest of my life. I refuse to be emotionally crippled by bc as I simply have too many goodthings to enjoy in life. I think that with time, many of us get to this point so be gentle with yourself , and you'll find a way there too. Caryn",

I would recommend these because in addition to infusions, the can be used for blood draws and imaging injections. I have a Bard power port. It is small, they make a petite model.All that is visible are three small bumps arranged in a triangular pattern under my skin. Mine was placed in the hollow between my shoulder and chest and is not visible unless I'm wearing spaghetti straps. It's very comfortable and I can sleep in any position. Installation is a simple procedure and can be done by a general surgeon. I love mine and given that I'm stage IV, have no intention of ever having it removed. Sorry to hear about the progression :( Keepingon, Most of the time PICC lines are inserted for short term usage, like needing IV antibiotics for a few weeks.That is why you don't see many women here who have them, at least in the US. Once healed, ports require no care or special treatment. They are flushed when you have infusions or blood draws. If they aren't going to be used for long periods of times they still need to be flushed but this is quick and easy process that the infusion nurses do. Caryn",

A little less than two years ago, I noticed considerable ankle swelling after a very long flight. I wasn't too concerned and it resolved quickly. Sometime after that, the same thing happened after another long flight. Again, not much concern. Then, it happened again last summer but did not resolve quickly. I saw my doctor and she suggested light compression after ultrasound showed no blood clot. The compression worked fairly well, through most of my school year, but by spring, the swelling was not well controlled and was moving up my leg. With school out, the swelling is less pronounced, since I'm not on my feet as much, but flares on days I am more active. More doctor visits, ultrasounds, vascular specialist etc. Verdict! LE induced by those long ago rads.i was fitted for a custom compression garment (open toe, single leg chaps) and await their arrival. It was interesting to see the consultations between vascular specialist, RO and mo. RO being the final word and saying, yes, rads in that area could induce leg LE (mo thought not!). I have no pain, save for occasional achiness at the ankle and I am grateful that rads killed the met. Still, it's one more unwanted souvenir of bc, and, from a vanity POV, it is ugly!

Early booking for cruising is one of those things. I love planning our shore excursions, but not flights and hotels (what, no driving to get to New Zealand?). I've cruised enough to, generally, stay away from the ship excursions so it's been fun finding reliable local tours. Again advance planning to get the best deals and make sure things are not booked up. On a side note, we have about two hours in the Honolulu airport before our flight to Auckland. Many years ago when I trained with Pan Am, we lived in a hotel near this airport and spent a lot of time there. I'm actually excited to be going back there after 30+ years! And to further encourage those who want to make big future plans, my younger dd and I have always wanted to do a Mediterranean cruise. Will be looking for good deals very soon. Happy planning and enjoy the moment too. Caryn",

Lots of personal stories,tips and hints from those of us who have just come through it. One thing I have loved is my recovery camisoles. I have both the Amoena and Softee Two brands (Kaiser paid for them). The Amoena looks like a workout type tank top and the Softee are more undershirt like. Both are soft and stretchy. I like the way they hold the drain bulbs and tubes close to my body and very comfy for day time or sleeping. Did not like the big safety pins they used to pin the drains to my gown in the hospital but some folks don't mind. Best to you all and feel free to ask me anything while the experience is still fresh in my mind! Caryn",

I would recommend not bringing your own pj's and robe to the hospital. It is much easier to accommodate an IV with the snap shoulder gowns supplied by the hospital than with your own. Use a second gown with the opening in front to function as a robe for hall walking. Lip balm was a must if you have dry lips but my throat has never bothered me after surgery. I am not a back sleeper so I found that a U shaped neck pillow made back sleeping easier for me. Face wipes were good for freshening up but I didn't use the body wipes until I got home because the nurse's aides gave me daily sponge baths. My hospital worked hard to create a healing environment and there were signs all over asking people to be quiet. It worked! I have never been in such a quiet hospital. The hospital stay goes quickly and most hospitals provide all of your needs so focus more on what you will need as you recover at home. Love and positive thoughts to you all. Caryn",

I do take a bunch of supplements as well and am always interested in learning about anything that might help me live well longer. I guess you could say I am taking the complementary route. Learning never hurts. Now, if I had exhausted every conventional option, I truly can't say what I'd do. It must be very scary at that point. I can certainly understand why one would try just about anything. I won't venture to guess how I might react until I've had to walk that path myself. You just never know. Caryn",

Your experience and comments on conventional doctors resonates with me. I have had both good and not so good conventional docs. If I am not comfortable with a doctor my solution is simple, I find a new one. I decided after my bmx, after my stage IV dx that I didn't really like my mo. My RO, who I love, recommended someone else and he was right, she is great. I realize that since I live in an urban area and belong to a huge HMO, I have the luxury of these choices. I realize that this is a privilege not everyone has. Additionally, I have always believed that I am an equal partner of my treatment team. If a doctor treats me as anything less than that, I move on. Of course, this does involve a great deal of responsibility on my part. I read, research and never hesitate to ask questions. The docs I have chosen respect me for that. Lastly, like you, I would never paint an entire profession with such a broad brush. It is simply not fair . As to alternative practitioners, I have never used one, but if I find myself in that position (strong believer in never knowing what I would do until I've walked in those shoes), I will use the same criteria as I use for conventional, to the extent that it's possible.

I found the one that looks like a stretchy tank top (in black,white, or nude) to be perfect and can be worn as a plain tank top when you remove the drain pockets. Since my ps did not let me shower until the drains were removed, I didn't worry about lanyards or pins. As for the gym, after my drains were out, 10 days, I was given permission to do light treadmill and recumbent bike work. You surgeon will wrap you in some kind of garment or bra so just bring a loose button front top to slip over it. My biggest hope for you is that after the surgery, when you get final path report that you don't need chemo. Remember, it is the oncologist, not the bs, who interprets the report and makes recommendations based on the path report. Best of luck to you! Caryn",

There are basically two types, masticating and centrifugal. You will need a masticating juicer if you want to juice wheat grass. I borrowed an old Jack LaLane juicer just to see if I liked juicing. It was huge, loud and a pain to clean but I loved the juice. I read lots of reviews and compared prices. For my money, the Breville Compact Juice Fountain was the winner. Compact is a bit of a misnomer since none are too small but it's smaller than many. It is a centrifugal juicer but does a good job on leafy greens and everything else I throw into it. I do not peel, core or cut most things as the feed chute is pretty wide. Citrus fruit is the exception since I find the peels produce a bit of juice that is too bitter for me. I juice lots of kale, broccoli and Chinese greens. Add a small apple and a couple of carrots to sweeten it a bit. A slice of fresh ginger is geat too. Bonus, the pulp Is great for composting. Warning, most juices turn a mucky green once you add a green veggie. Doesn't look great but is so light and fresh that I look forward to it each day. There may be a juicing thread somewhere on bco. Happy juicing! Caryn PS: I buy all produce at from organic vendors at a local farmers market",

So just because you haven't developed it now doesn't mean you're out of the woods. Taking precautions and being fully aware of it's symptoms becomes a lifelong job. This was really emphasized in the class I took. I have also been reminded of it every time I have had my blood pressure taken since surgery and when I got a flu shot yesterday. Had to say, \"right arm only!\"For those who've had nodes taken from both sides, I'm told the leg is used for bp. Caryn",

The reality is that 25-30% of those diagnosed at an earlier stage develop mets. The disease has no respect for age, or prior tx. It happens to us at all ages and stages of our lives, despite our best efforts to control it. Although you're overwhelmed right now Istrongly recommend a second opinion at the best facility you can get to. It will really help with treatment decisions and give you more confidence in your tx plan. As for aggressive tx, more is not always better. Some of us with limited bone mets who are ER+ have done very well on anti-hormonals alone. I had rads to my femur and an AI, no aggressive chemo , or any chemo at all for that matter. I live an almost normal life. However, we are all different and a second opinion will be of great help and give you confidence in whatever tx is proposed.Take care.",

I agree with coolbreeze that anxiety is clearly a major issue (cancer not withstanding). I am not a psychiatrist but I think your focus on the worst case scenario and lots of self diagnosis has put you in an unhealthy place. That being said, I also agree with amf in that intuition can be powerful and you should see a breast specialist. At a certain point however, if doctors and tests say that you don't have cancer( and I hope that's the case) you will have to somehow reconcile that with what you are feeling. I am unclear on one thing. You say the mass has not been visible on the imaging you've had so far but it is very palpable to you. Is it palpable to the docs you've seen? -Caryn",

The answer is simple; no one really knows! It is likely that there is no single factor but a combination that creates the perfect storm, so to speak. Other than to benefit those who come after you, what would be the point in discovering what caused your bc? By the time you're stage IV, you want to live as well as you can. You may have a short time or a long time left (hopefully the latter), don't waste it on things that don't matter now. BTW, if this is eating at you, consider counseling and anti-depressants. I have been on Effexor since early on in my dx. I work full time and live, almost, as I did before bc. It won't last forever but I'm going to enjoy it! Take good care of yourself. Caryn",

When it was first proposed, about 20 months ago, I admit to being leery of planning so far out. But I'm so glad I did because it's almost here and I'm so excited! A family member made all the arrangements and bought travel insurance that covered pre-existing conditions but there is a time deadline for purchasing it within so many days of booking. This will be my 4th cruise and my longest so far. cruisecritic.com is a great sorce of info for anything cruise related. They have very active forums.

Here's why college is important. In order to remain competitive in the world market , and our economy is global, the advantage goes to those who are prepared for 21st century jobs. Those jobs most often require the level of expertise that comes with a college degree. That's not to say that every job requires a college degree but the types of jobs that the global economy requires increasingly do. As for there being no jobs, we have just come out of an economic low. Hiring is on the uptick and the jobless rate is declining (not fast enough for some, but declining never the less). I live in Silicon Valley and our slump was major yet now, anyone who has a degree in areas related to the high tech industry is having a fairly easy time finding a job. Yet workers from other countries with HB1 visas are filling some of those jobs because we are not producing enough graduates in some tech areas. Yes, there will always be some jobs for those with high school diplomas, but fewer in number and salaries for many of those jobs, especially in the service industry are low paying.We need to educate students for the way the world economy is, not what it was. Yes, there are success stories without college and failures with college but the need for higher education in the 21st century is a reality. As an educator, you could argue my bias, and I would heartily agree, but part of my job as an educator is to look at where we're going in terms of what students need. What do we need to give them to prepare them for not only their future but our nation's future? How do we get them ready to compete in the global,economy? The answer is clear, higher education. Why set the bar low when we can set it high? Caryn, a very passionate teacher :)",

My beautiful granddaughter comes courtesy of my older, and equally beautiful, dd and wonderful SIL. I had spring break this week and managed (between medical appointments) to spend several days and nights with them. I loved helping them cook, clean, shop, do laundry etc. These things are just dull chores in my own home but I did them with great joy for my family. Younger dd was with us too for the last two days so that made things even better. And of course, the greatest joy was just holding that sweet little baby. I could have spent hours staring at her tiny face.

I was staged IIB and set to do a clinical trial. - Had to do an echocardiogram for trial. Fluid found around my heart. - Fluid turns out to be nothing, but spot found on femur. - After the whole pneumothorax mess is resolved, biopsy shows 2cm bc met on upper femur. - A decision is made to nuke the met with rads, go on an AI and do Aredia infusions for two years. Aredia is an older bone strengthener. So, I used the port for Aredia only. I continue to use it for scans and blood draws. Since it doesn't bother me or show, I've chosen to leave it in, knowing I will probably need it one day. Despite the fact that I am not superstitious, there is a part of me that thinks the minute I remove it, I'll have progression. So as irrational as it seems, it's a bit of a talisman for me. Don't laugh 🤗.",

It\u2019s almost impossible to say if lymph nodes are involved at your stage so guessing \u201clikelihood \u201c is pointless. You mentioned no family history, but the majority of breast cancer patients have no family history . PET scans are very expensive and expose one to radiation so it\u2019s not usual for someone with suspected early stage bc to have one, but I can\u2019t say it\u2019s never done. My counsel at this point is to not get ahead of yourself. Please wait until you know what you are dealing with (hopefully it\u2019s benign), and then you can learn specifics based on your particular type of bc. Wishing you the best!",

Since they are not standard of care or covered by insurance (as far as I know), most forgo them. There are clinical trials going on in some places (UCSF is/was trialing Dignicaps). Those who do use them are very motivated and willing to absorb the expense and have helpers with them during chemo. Not a judgement at all, but just an individual choice. When I thought in was to have chemo, I looked into them but decided the expensewasn't worth it for me .",

Here's what I found: Not to be confused with Chronic toxicity. A chronic condition is a human health condition or disease that is persistent or otherwise long-lasting in its effects or a disease that comes with time.[1] The term chronic is usually applied when the course of the disease lasts for more than three months.[1] Common chronic diseases include arthritis, asthma, cancer, COPD, diabetes and viral diseases such as hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS. In medicine, the opposite of chronic is acute. A chronic course is further distinguished from a recurrent course; recurrent diseases relapse repeatedly, with periods of remission in between. The non-communicable diseases are also usually lasting medical conditions but are separated by their non-infectious causes. In contrast, some chronic diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, are caused by transmissible infections. Chronic diseases constitute a major cause of mortality and the World Health Organization (WHO) reports chronic non-communicable conditions to be by far the leading cause of mortality in the world, representing 35 million deaths in 2005 and over 60% of all diseases. - Source; Wikipedia. By this definition, chronic disease does not carry a promise of survivability. When my mo mentioned chronic, I thought long term, but I never thought there was a promise of cure or even 20 years, just some undefined lengthy period of time. Yes, I would love a cure, but I'm ok with chronic, for now (but I still think it was a puff piece",

They allow two importsnt things; injection of tracer materials, such as those used for PET scans (just used mine this morning) and blood draws. No more needle sticks or searching for veins! Of course these functions can only be performed by port trained nurses (not lab techs). My medical facility alway asks if port access is needed for scans and I have my blood draws at the infusion center. They are well set up to use the power port for all it's intended ways. Some have reported getting power ports and then going to facilities which don't make trained personnel available except for actual infusions. Another thought on port placement is the upper arm. Not as common, but several women I know have had it placed there. Take care.",

They did know what treatment I was getting, (it was to be IV chemo whether in the trial or not) as I was supposed to go into a clinical trial and was thought to be stage IIB. When the PET scan was done, to figure out what the fluid around my heart was, they discovered 1) a completely collapsed right lung 2) a spot on my femur. Yes, I hit the jackpot! After the collapsed lung was dealt with, a biopsy confirmed that the spot on my femur was bc. So... I was out of the trial, out of any proposed stage IIB chemo and on to tx for stage IV, which has been an AI, rads to the bone met and two years of Aredia. Coming up on 5 years and still NED. As to why I have such a stealth port, with no visible line, and only palpation bumps visible, I can't say. I rarely know it's there and neither does anyone else. PS: the fluid around my heart is still there but is idiopathic and unchanged. It is evaluated every time I have a scan.",

She attends her own funeral, tells everyone exactly how she feels about them and spends all of her retirement money etc., only to find out that she is not going to die from cancer. A great line from another segment is \"I hate my thighs. Why couldn't I get thigh cancer?\" As far as inheritances go, I am spending what I can on me! My children are professionals and have good jobs and benefits. They will get certain things, like a pay off from my state pension, and the sale of my townhouse (not insignificant in Silicon Valley), my investments and my granddaughter gets my 403b. I told my parents, long ago, that they should spend their money on themselves while they could. They had already given us life, a good education and ethics so we were all fine as far as those things go. I realize that my children are grown and on their own but of course I'd be more concerned about providing for them if they were younger. BTW, they agree that I should spend my money on whatever I want and are not looking for an inheritance.",

I don't remember toileting difficulties, though I moved slowly and gently in the beginning. I did use moist wipes. A radical would be far more debilitating, but is very much the exception, so check with your surgeon and best of luck. PS: I did some googling and found that radical mastectomies fell out of favor in the 1970's and is only used under unusual circumstances. Having all muscles removed is not only extreme and disfiguring but would certainly have a major impact on range of motion.",

I do think they cause a problem when they become a crippling force in your life and you can't move beyond them. As for medical or tx regrets, I have been fortunate. My doctors were always upfront about risks to any procedure or tx and I researched them as well. I had a very bad, though rare, complication from port placement, a collapsed lung. However, I knew there was a 1% chance this would happen. I almost laughed because the cances were so small. I also had a rough time getting it to re-inflate (3 separate chest tube insertions, 6 days in the hospital and almost 1 month with a portable chest tube). Regrets? No! I love my port now and would never use my experience to warn someone against getting one. Neither I nor any medical professional can predict ahead of time if one will be in the group that suffers an adverse event, even if the chance is only 1%. Caryn",

I hope that things can be resolved.

We sign an acceptable use agreement annually and are aware of this policy. So, if there is something personal or something you want to keep private you know not to do it over the district's network and not on your district email address . I imagine that other school districts and businesses have similar policies. Caryn",

So, I didn't do chemo and have done well on Arimidex for almost 3 years. I find have rads to the site of my bone met and had infusions of a bone strengthener for 2 years.

Before I was known to be stage IV, chemo was planned and my mo said I shouldn't work because I am a teacher of young children, but many can and do work during chemo. Please reach out to any and all social services programs that can provide support (rides to chemo, cleaning for a cause etc.) to help lighten the load. The American Cancer Socity and your hospital social worker can be good resources. If you have two types of aggressive cancer, I'm not sure why you feel you likely won't have metastasis in the future, though no one has a crystal ball. Depending on your specific dx, your chances may vary, statistically, but \u201cfeeling\" that you likely don't/won't have mets now or in the future is not a factor. FWIW, I had a very indolent grade 1 tumor and much to everyone's surprise I already had a bone met. My point is that there is still so much that remains a mystery about bc, so please consider the fact that you already know your bc is aggressive. Ultimately, you are the driver and you have every right to make the choices you want. But please consider not just where you're at right now, but where you'll be long term . All the best",

So, only you can decide who/how much to tell. I have never been dishonest about my situation but have chosen to keep it low key at work. BC and stage IV in particular are more complex than most people realize and I just don't have the time or inclination to explain it all. At this point, I look quite well and live a fairly normal life. That won't always be so and as I feel the need to tell more people I will.

Do you have bone and liver cancer (primaries) or a metastasis of breast cancer? If they are mets of bc, they are treated as breast cancer and still considered bc so you do not have bone or liver cancer. Bone and liver cancer are entirely different and treated differently. I have bone mets and have done well. I know we have members with liver mets and a thread dedicated to that. I know someone will be along soon to help you out. Take care.",

As for those who reported me, I do believe there was a touch of malice there as I have some idea who they were. If their goal was to see me get a slap on the wrist and/ or upset me then they accomplished that. Hope they're proud of themselves! Anyway, I'll stick with my stage IV sisters who are truly compassionate and seem disinclined to play games. Caryn",

I ran to Starbucks immediately afterward and would have injected the coffee through my port if that had been possible. Then a bit of retail therapy and in a few minutes, I'll be doing a major shoe purge. My walk in closet has turned in to a trip in closet and, honestly, I have lots of shoes I never wear.

When I was in the Peace Corps, in 1978, I woke up one day with an unimaginably painful headache. I'm a bit fuzzy on exactly what happened, but I ended up in the USAID dispensary, the closest thing there was to a Western hospital in country. I can't even find words to describe how excruciating that headache was. They pumped me full of some kind of drugs that left me conscious but very, very loopy. I'm they told me they were going to do a spinal tap but (I am told) that I giggled incessantly and kept asking them to cut my head off. I do remember that I had to lay flat for a long period of time and I had more pain meds. But after the tap, my headache was gone. Turns out I had meningitis and my head was not cut off 😊",

Sincerity would be particularly hard to gage. Throw in the fact that we're dealing with advanced bc, and the potential exists for lots of misunderstandings and dust ups. I know that my words have been misconstrued from time to time. It's just a limitation of the medium.  BTW, this may be selfish, but since I feel like my time on earth may be limited, I've just tried to find the best medical care I could, do what I need to mitigate se's and live my life with happiness. Do I wish there were a better way? Of course, but I'd be lying if I said I'm going to put a lot of my time and energy into being a crusader for those things. I admire those who can and do, but that's not where my talents lie.",

The key word in the forum header is respect. How one chooses to show respect, is of course, subjective though my hope is that one would take the more conservative approach. Here is a response from the mods to me , via pm, when I sought clarification about posting on stage IV. Ironically, I was just a few short weeks away from my own stage IV dx. \"This is a forum for those who are braving more treatment and managing the ups and downs of a stage IV or metastatic breast cancer diagnosis. Their caring supporters are welcome as well. Thank you for respecting their very special space and for your sensitivity.\" Regards, Judith and the Mods This was in the Fall of 2011. It does leave room for one to interpret the meaning of respect. I chose to go the conservative route (but little did I know...). It just didn't seem that important for me to post on stage IV when their issues were not mine and there were so many other threads that were more pertinent at the time. Just how I feel and I hope this doesn't turn into a big dust up again. As someone who is stage IV, this is the last thing I want to spend my time on (and housework).",

I did feel like I was burdening my daughters and their mates when I was going through surgeries and hospitalizations last year. My older dd was pregnant at the time.I hated that she had to help take care of me and worry when she should have been enjoying a stress free pregnancy. But life doesn't always give us perfect timing. Ultimately, I realized that this what family does for each other and I'd do the same for them without thinking twice about it. It's not anything to blame yourself for. Be gentle to yourself .

This is a very large forum and without a specific location, a name like Sunnybrook will be meaningless to most. Since you are HER2+, you have had neo-adjuvant chemo. Further info on your bc will be available after surgery and you will probably continue to receive Herceptin.Most of us trade in hope, and reality, when it comes to bc, so you won't see many scary stories. We have all stages and types of bc and are here for support and info, not fear mongering. Wishing you the best.",

Also the fact that your mother and aunt were dx'ed at well over age 40, would make it even less likely that the bc is BRCA related.

      "Content": "Mar 13, 2015 08:43PM - edited Mar 13, 2015 09:10PM by exbrnxgrl Let me start by saying that every family, ultimately, makes their own decisions on this subject. However as an educator (mostly teaching grades 1 and K) I strongly urge parents to tell their children the truth , at an age appropriate level. Here is why; Children are very intuitive and very sensitive to changes in their household, but they lack the emotional maturity, life experience and context in which to frame, cope and understand these things. So, unless you are an amazing actor or you lie to cover up what's happening, your child will know that something is not right. They may not verbalize it, but the stress and anxiety will surface in some way. Five is not too young. The American Cancer Society is a good resource for info on how to speak to children about cancer. Though I teach first grade now, I taught kindergarten for 8 years. When a major family problem occurred, I saw parents who openly, and appropriately, dealt with it by telling their children. I saw, a very few, who chose to say nothing. Without going into detail, the children who knew what was happening in their family had a much easier time than children kept in the dark. I feel very, very strongly about this and though I can't tell your husband what to do, I'd be happy to tell him the possible repercussions of keeping a child in the dark. My best wishes are with you and your family. Caryn PS: if your daughter is in school, please let her teacher know what's happening",

Family history is a very minor factor as only a small percentage of bc cases have the genes, BRCA 1&2, that we know. If you read enough of our histories, you'll see we are varied in lifestyles, diet, weight, careers or about anything else you can think of as can be.

The area where the biopsy was to be taken was numbed with a local an anesthetic. It felt like I was conscious, I was able to talk and respond to questions, but felt no discomfort . Versed has some amnesiac properties, so my memory of it is fuzzy, though at the time I thought I was very alert. It took less than an hour, once I was prepped. I was monitored for about and 60-90 minutes afterwards. I was very hungry and devoured a turkey sandwich and cranberry juice while I rested.

Yes, we could conduct our own surveys, but they would just be anecdotal. It would be very difficult for us to isolate cause and effect in anything but the most casual way, since it would be hard to control for many other factors in a casual survey. Once we have been dx'ed with bc, focusing on the tx does become a priority for the vast majority of us. As for prevention, of either an initial bc or recurrence, many, many researchers have looked at it with very few tangible conclusions. That is what is so frustrating and why it feels like a real crapshoot (you will see this phrase crop up regularly). Keep reading through both the conventional and alternative threads and you will see many different theories and approaches to diet and lifestyle. However, there seems to be little commonality when it comes to \"success\". For instance, I have used only conventional tx, with some supplements and had been NED for 4 years. My bone met is necrotic and I've had no progression. My diet has always been healthy, but not extreme. If I want to eat or drink something, I do and never feel a bit of guilt. I believe in moderation, not compulsion. My younger sister was dx'ed with uterine cancer at age 50. She led a compulsively clean lifestyle since her early 20's. Not only with respect to food, but no antiperspirants, plastics, microwaves etc. She was thin and exercised. She was dead within 4 months of her dx. Just another anecdote, but a good illustration of why anecdotes and casual surveys may not yield the answers we are looking for.",

Have you seen an oncologist? I am not saying your bs is wrong, but an oncologist should be making the tx choices. Also, as you are scheduled to have quite a few scans, more information effecting tx choices may be known after the scans. As far as other people go, you may be surprised to find out how kind and generous they can be. I am a first grade teacher in a close school community. While not revealing every nitty gritty detail of my disease, I was very open and honest. I controlled the information so there was nothing to gossip or whisper about. Everyone was amazing (except one or two!).I would also urge you to be as open and honest with your daughter as you can on an age appropriate level. When children don't know what's going on, that's when they worry and are vulnerable to stress and anxiety. The American Cancer Society web site has some good ideas and resources to help with talking to children about cancer. Please let us know as much as possible about your bc by allowing your diagnosis line to show at the bottom of your posts. This will help people to give you advice and support. Wishing you the best.

When I have been given pink related stuff, I say thank you (because the intention was good) and then don't use it. Two of my former students made me a pink ribbon print fleece blanket. They were only in second grade. It was so very sweet and I would never get upset, however, my younger dd has it because she likes snuggling up on her couch with it. If adults ask me why I'm not on the pink bandwagon, I calmly tell them and leave it at that. As a result, four years into this, I rarely get pink stuff. Time is really a great help. I also don't want pity or attention, so in the beginning, I kept my dx relatively quiet. Over the last year, I've casually dropped it in to conversation if the topic of bc came up. I even mentioned it on FB and, much to my surprise, got very little reaction, either way. After 4 years, no one brings me food, but it was very helpful after my surgery ( no left overs, all delicious and fresh!) especially for my dd's who were helping care for me. They didn't have to worry about shopping and cooking. I should add that because I don't \"look\" like I have bc and still work, travel etc. people probably are a bit baffled by my condition. I realize that I am fortunate, for now, but my future is still quite uncertain, as we all know. Mostly, I try not to fritter too much of my time, energy or emotions on what others think.

When I thought I was having chemo I bought a wig and a halo hairpiece. Never wore them for more than a few minutes to try them on but they're sitting in a drawer for my use one day. Yesterday, our 5th graders came back from science camp, A girl who has alopecia , and always wore a hat or wig, stepped off the bus wearing a nice pair of earrings and a big smile. She had never appeared at school without her head covered but looked so happy and confident that I almost cried. She had been in my kindergarten class and we spent a lot of time educating both parents and students about alopecia. I know this is very different from chemo induced baldness but it did make me think of many of my bco sisters and the role hair places in our lives. Sorry to get off topic. Caryn",

If they ask more specific questions, I answer honestly, but a surprising number ask nothing further. I didn't do this earlier on because I was  in no mood to explain the whole messy business of bc.
