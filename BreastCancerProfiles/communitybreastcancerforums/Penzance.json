It even came back several months later when a physio handled my back a bit roughly (no pillow under tummy). My other physio who has a lot of experience of bc topd me it's normal: wound healing inside the breast + lymphatic system evacuating debris. I wouldn't have my in law do a u/s on me. Can't you see a non family member? Best wishes",

Re the anxiety, before my dx, I had 0 foreshadowing, 0 apprehension: half a dozen doctors had looked at the fibro and thought it was just a big fibro... And it didnt it wasnt a ductal, but they found some lobular ( which does not form lumps). It felt so unreal, I nearly thought it was a practical joke :) Best wishes, thinking of your dad.",

Apparently that's what happened to me, and they also found carcinoma in the surrounding area. The radiologist was very surprised too, he said the incidence was 0.01% and if I hadn't had an existing diagnosis, he wouldn't even have recommended a biopsy. Found the following article on PubMed: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6329129 Good luck to you all.",

I was 39 and couldn't believe it either: no family history, reasonably fit, healthy BMI, and everyone had told me it looked like a bog standard fibroadenoma. I was very, very shocked and extremely angry. Still am, especially after stupid Pinktober. Looks like your radiologist and doctor are on the ball. MD Anderson has a great reputation, you're lucky to live nearby. Hope people around you are supportive. Lots of info on here, don't hesitate to ask questions, and I would second the notebook tip. It helps you 'screen' doctors too: I find out that I don't get along with the ones who won't let me ask questions. Best wishes.",
