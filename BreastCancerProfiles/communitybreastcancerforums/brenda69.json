Anyway, I wanted a pt/ct to confirm- he insisted on skeletal survey.  Tests came back with no mets-  my fear and questions are--- I thougth bone mets will not show up on x-rays unless 50% of the bone is destroyed (dr thought i was crazy).  now i am looking for a new dr. in Knox. TN   He did give me a presc for PT- after telling me the 1st visit that it is useless??  No pain killers for 4 mo.s now- do i have to go to the emergency room?  Sorry for ranting but it helps!",

There was also uptake to the region of the pubic symphysis.  I was dx with IDC, gr 3, stg 1 N0 in 2005. 4x AC and 35 rads.  My husband thinks I am a hypo sometimes but this time I am really worried.  The specialist didnt call me with the results I had to go by the hospital and pick them up myself.  It is also recommending a CT.  All I wanted was a diagnosis of arthritis or osteo and ways to manage it--- I might have got more??  Besides that- I turned 39 today and my son calls last night to tell me I am a grandma.  This is the weekend from hell--- Sorry I am venting-- did any one have rib mets present this way??

Does your rib mets hurt?  Reason I doubt the fractures- is when i fractured my 10th, I knew it and the pain was intense.  So in the past year there are more?  I decided to put off the Ct until after I get back from Alaska- my son is graduating HS before going to Marines on June 8th.  And congrats to you!!  That baby is adorable",
