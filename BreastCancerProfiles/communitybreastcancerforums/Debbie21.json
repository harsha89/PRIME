The doctor said MRIs are recommended for high risk woman with dense breasts. However, its done with the mammogram (at the same appointment). The doctor said some facilities do them 6 months apart but that is not the best way. Together they raise the % of detection significantly. They complement each other. But MRIs also have a high false positive rate depending on the skill of the person doing and interpreting it. The hospital I went to has Doctors doing the MRIs and they have a much lower false positive rate than most hospitals. I chose to do ultra sound with my mammograms, since the false positive rate is lower and with a mammogram increase detection up to 97%",
