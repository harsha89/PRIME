Each of us has had a little something different with out diagnosis or treatments, but you can match up with the forum that best matches yours, and you will get great insight.  We aren't here to scare the pants off you, nor to sugar cost things.  We are here because we care about other women who are going through what we have.  I feel like I have such a great set of friends here, though I may never meet any of them. Ask questions on the boards, and if you want to ask something personal, send a PM to that person.  We are not here to sell you anything, and our support is free!  Meece",

I also feel that our hair defines us in so many ways.  When (if) we lose our eyebrown and eyelashes, we look like anyone else with cancer, our individuality appears to have fallen out with the hair.  But, many women take the opportunity to step out of their box and buy different wigs for different moods.  Ones which bring out the hidden personality.  Someone whose spouse has always liked long hair may take the opportunity to sport short hair.  Likewise a mousy brunette might try auburn hair, etc, etc.. I've mentioned this elsewhere, but if I were facing chemo again, I would have my eyebrows tatooed lightly while I still have them, that way I would know where to stencil them when I lost them.",

Coolbreeze, I have been following your blog for awhile now.  I had to check it out when I saw your sarcasm was on the same level as mine can be.  Off topic, but in response to a post a couple of days ago, GET THE PORT!  I wasn't given the option and last Monday I went through heck while two nurses tried to draw blood!  My veins in my \"good arm\"  have all but shut down.  I had great veins before treatment, almost too large.  Adriamycin kills 'em off, or at least strangles them pretty good. Back to hair,  I was not in a financial situation to get many wigs, and I, like Tamlyn, felt very self concious about mine for awhile.  Let me give you a little bit of advice pre-chemo:  If I had to do it again, I would go in before chemo and have my eyebrows tatooed, maybe not the same \"density\" as normal, but it would make it so much easier to have them in the right place.  I used stencils and brow powder to make mine, but I really would opt for the tatoo if I had thought of it.",

From my experience,if you have a lumpectomy, your breast will remain swollen for a few weeks.  The full extent of the appearance won't be seen for awhile, so you have time to figure out how to mask the change, if any.  If you have an opportunity, asked about all options for reconstruction, your BC may not have all the information, but a skilled PS will. There are so many variables, none of us can tell you what your breast will look like after, just what we have experienced.  We understand where you are coming from.  Come here, ask questions, and do not look towards the worst.  If it is cancer, this forum is a priceless resource.  Don't expect the surgeon to have a diagnosis Thursday.  He may, or may not be able to tell you what you need to hear without an excisional biopsy.  Once the tissue is gone, even just the lump, you will feel better/relieved.

I can only imagine how you felt when all this happened so quickly, and what you saw when you went to your mother's room.  But I admire you for pausing to contemplate what you would do, and coming through for your mother. Your brother and sister may have looted all the memories of things from your mothers house, but you will be creating memories for her every day from now on.  She will smile when thinking of the time she gets to go for that  frozen coffee drink with YOU!!!

I had the mx or lumpectomy choice given to me before surgery, but I had no path back on it yet.  I chose lumpectomy, but due to being a triple negative, I had to have chemo and rads.  I might have chosen the mx if I had known first.  Hindsight is 20/20.

Redbarb, I was never offered a port.  I too, had great veins (in fact they were quite pronounced.) I remember on my first chemo watching someone get their i.v. in and he was being such a baby!  I thought \"I would never act like that!\"  I did well for the first half of tx, but after getting blood draws once or twice a week, and  then the i.v.s from chemo, my veins started breaking down, Since you should not have needle sticks on the same side you have your lymph node removed, that cuts the vein choices in half.Towards the end of chemo, I started acting like a baby when they did the i.v.  There were certain nurses I would not let attempt the i.v.  and I would tell them exactly where they could try.  Now, six years later, I still have problems when someone needs to take blood or start an I.V.  All that being said, if I had the chance tro do it again (which I pray I never will) I would definietly have the port put in. You will be in my prayers today, Mimi.",

As for encapsulation, the actual implant doesn't harden, but the scar tissue can form around the implant and contract making a hard implant.  Called Capsular Contracture.  I waited 5 years before I did mine, so maybe the success so far is because my tissue had enough time make sure the vascular structure was still working well. I would suggest one or two more opinions.  Yes your PS may be one of th ebest in the country, but he may be set in his parameters and you need someone who will think broader.",

The following are SOME of the signs of lymphedema: * Swelling in the arms, hands, fingers, shoulders, chest, or legs. The swelling may occur for the first time after a traumatic event (such as bruises, cuts, sunburn, and sports injuries), after an infection in the part of the body that was treated for cancer, or after an airplane trip lasting more than three hours. * A \"full\" or heavy sensation in the arms or legs. * Skin tightness. * Decreased flexibility in the hand, wrist, or ankle. * Difficulty fitting into clothing in one specific area. * Tight-fitting bracelet, watch, or ring that wasn't tight before. ",

Well I have rambled on long enough.  Good night, ladies.  Thank you for being here for me.",

My previous Radiologist (an MD) ordered my first, but forgot to write \"with and without contrast\" on the orders.  I got to the MRI location and they startd my IV, then the nurse came out to the waiting area and said it wasn't on the orders and took it out.  The MRI tech said that it would have added an hourf to the time.  Two of my doctors who reviewed the results said it was useless not to have the section with contract. That being said, I had another one when I started with my current oncologist, with and without contrast. It took close to an hour an a half lying on my stomach, arms over my head, very still, with my breasts hanging through the table.  It was difficult, and uncomfortable, but the Dr. was happy with the images.  It took several weeks to get my insurance on board.  They would only approve it for my post cancer breast.  Once they finally approved both sides, t was done. I had another MRI in January, and the women's imaging center has come a long way.  I was still belly down, but the table is shaped (or moves into a position) so that my arms were bent slighly hanging down but more to my sides and my head and chest were raised so my back wasn't flat. Doesn't sound comfortable, but compared to the old way, this was great.  That, and the time it takes has shortened to less than 45 minutes.  The tech played my choice of music, and would tell me that \"the next section of the test will take two songs.  It made the time pass better. My opinion:  MRI seems to be a good diagnostic, and monitoring tool.  Make sure you get insurance approval for both breasts before the test.  Check to see how up-to-date the imaging machine is at the place you are going.  A women's imaging center is more likely to have the more comfortable table than a general iaing center.   If you are not happy with your doctor's \"No\". get a second opinion.",

So although the news is tenatively good (The abnomality is not as bad as it was) it is still in the abnormal range as it was 18 months ago, I am facing a third MRI in a six month period, and more waiting!I also get to be concerned about another area showing up. I feel like the boy who cried wolf. Thank you all for your love and concern and for being with me during the whole thing.

I waited for surgery one, because I didn't know that insurance would cover it, and two, I needed to build up some time off.  My first recon I had surgery on Thursday and was back at work on Monday...Stupid.  But, I didn't have time off, and my work has been less that cooperative.  The most recent surgery I had surgery on the 19th of the month and went back on the 30th.  I still wish I had taken more time.  I am so happy you are getting Emend.  It was an emotional lifesaver for me.  ",

They also recommend if you don't have to have an underwire, try to get by without one indefinitely.  They recommend going and being professionally fitted if you still experience pain, and not to Victoria's Secret. I am a year out and may contact my PS and see what he recommends.  I have been toying with going to the local Bra shop for a fitting, but I never have time, and know it won't be cheap.",

(That and the thought of a reaction again).  The only thing that is uncomfortable about the procedure is that when they inject the contrast, it gives you a warm feeling that sometimes feels like you wet yourself.

I think you can go to Walmart and pick up a cheapie cassette player to have in case you want to listen to the meeting again.  I think that was a good thing to give you, becaus eit is such a whirlwind of info to process.  I remember my NP wrote everything on the tissue paper exam table covering.  If I had had the presence of mind, i would have taken it with me.  But I didn't. I believe that many women who have the BMX when the path report seems to indicate less, may be relying on the Oncotype/BRCA genetic testing to make their decisions. ",

Each time, getting up out of bed or off of the couch, took help for a few days.  You want to make sure you aren't pulling stitches or anything. And you probably won't feel like standing in the kitchen preparing meals either. Do you have a good friend who could come stay with you until you feel comfortable?  Someone from church or a social group you belong to?  The hospital will not let you leave without a designated driver.  I suppose a taxi would work, My DS wanted so badly for me to have him come home from the USAF, but I had him come home during chemo for his visit. Some women go through it a lot better than others.  Butmy recommendation is that you have a back-up plan for help. As for work, I worked in a school/classroom for behavioral problem children from 1st through 8th grades.  I had surgery on Friday morning and went back to work on Monday.  I worked 5 hours a day.  During Chemo, I missed one day of work due to surgery, one due to nausea, and some partial days since the taxol chemo took longer.

I definitely have no medical educatoin, other than my experience, but this is how it had been explained to me.",

Imagine how surprised I was to see my ex show up on my front porch asking if it was true because another person had called his house looking for me and told him everything he knew about me.  This man who told my ex is a lawyer and was a legal advisor to the organization!  He knew I wasn't living with my ex, so why did he even call there?  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Sidenote, I kept the kids, and Ex got limited visitation (29 hours every two weeks.) HA!",

Once you have dealt with cancer in any form, it is always in the back of your mind. This summer I had some issues and went thorough a series of scans and tests and I worried about metastasis the whole time. I found that keeping myself busy helped to ease my anxiety.

Komen Foundation gives money to Planned Parenthood.  Call me naive, but I thought the donations for Komen were going toward research for the cure, not towards screening (Which is what Komen is claiming the money to PP is for).  How much of this donation money is actually going toward finding the cure?  Not legal fees or funding other types of organizations.  I realize screening is an important thing for all of us.  I just envisioned all this money funding some huge laboratory working 24/7 with scientists scurrying like busy ants trying to find a cure or prevention for BC.",

At 40, the drs felt it was giving me the best chance for non-recurrence. Chemo is no walk in the park, but it is doable, and it doesn't have to mean you'll be house bound or bedridden.  It just means you are fighting the fight with as many weapons as you can.

Nicole, I waited 5 years to begin recon.  I wish I had tried sooner.  The rads have really come into play in the recon.  It is amazing how something that does so much tissue damage (RADS) can be such a lifesaving treatment.",

On my first chemo, I saw a guy a few chairs down, whining as the nurse put in the IV.  I thought to myself, \"what a baby!\"  By chemo number 5, I was choosing the nurse I wanted to start the IV, because certain ones would try several times and fail.   I am nearly 7 years out, and my veins never rebounded.  I will interject here, I have great veins on my left side, and had them on my right, veins have never been a problem for me.  When I have to have a blood draw or IV now, it is an ordeal. I have had my veins blown so many times, and that hurts!  Last week, I had to have a CT and Blood Draw.  I warned the Tech starting the IV of the vein issues, and she still blew the vein the first attempt. So, Pink, I hope that you will consider this when contemplating the port.  I have no experience about the alien issue, and I have noticed women are ready to get them out by the end of treatment, but I think that is partially attributed to the fact that it is a sign that tx is over!  You do what is right for you, but use the information from all these ladies to make an informed decision.",

CEA is used mainly to monitor the treatment of cancer patients, especially those with colon cancer. Following surgery, CEA values are helpful in monitoring the response to therapy and in determining whether the disease has recurred. CEA is also used as a marker for other forms of cancer, including cancers of the rectum, lung, breast, liver, pancreas, stomach, and ovary. Not all cancers produce CEA, and a positive CEA test is not always due to cancer. Therefore, CEA is not used for screening the general population. Hope that helps",

Most likely you are going in for outpatient surgery, in and out in the same day.  They usually have you come in at least 2 hours before your schedueld surgery time.  You will not be allowed to eat or drink ANYTHING for at least 8 hours prior to surgery.  That included swallowing any water when you brush your teeth.   They will have you change into a hospital gown and will start an i.v. Your anesthesiologist will come in and speak to you, and you can ask her any questions you might have.  Your surgeon may or may not do the same.  Be prepared that you will be answering the same questions several times.  They will ask name, d.o.b. and what you are having done.  They want to make sure they start surgery on the right breast, and the right patient. You will wake up in a post op area.  They will be watching you and will probably release you after you have gone to the restroom, and can sit up, stand up  and walk.  You will probably be groggy and once you get home you will want to sleep. You have to have someone there to take you home.  That person will probably need to visit the pharmacy for you, maybe while you are in recovery.  You will probably have a rx for pain medication and antibiotics.  The following couple of days you probably won't be up for playing volleyball, ore much of anything.  When you are up and about you will probably feel best wearing a nice supportive bra, possibly even a sports bra (as long as it fastens and doesn't just pull over.) Most important, if you have any questions about how you should handle this, ask your BS.  You can verify anything I have written with her.  This is just my experience from 4 breast surgeries. Best of luck.  If you believe in God, please know I am praying for you. Meece",

My current husband found you here in September when I faced a stereotactic vacuum assisted core biopsy after a questionable mammo in conjunction with other symptoms.  I am so glad he found this site.  I was a wreck and my fears were eased, but more importantly they were acknowledged.  So many people just like to tell you \"You'll be fine\".  Nobody wants to admit that cancer happens. Last December I finally bagan reconstruction.  I am going to have stage 2 on the 19th.  I hope that this will be the last.  I hate surgery, and I hate anethesia.  I am learning so much about options here, and I can go to my PS informed. Thank you all!",

Anyway, my doctor filled out the paperwork, letting them know the estimated amount of time or days I would need to cover surgery/recovery, tests and appointments.  I returned it and now I don't seem to have difficulty getting time off, no matter what day.  I have the option of keeping up to 40 hours of PTO in my bank, but have to use PTO over 40 hours first before I opt for time without pay. I have my all my different doctors appointments and test covered, and it has sure made things easier.  They don't dare deny me access to my medical treatment, now that it is in my personnel record.

I am sure there is a PS who specializes in BC recon in your area.  You are so close to that \"Big City\".  I travel 160 miles for mine.  IMHO the PS you saw yesterday was afraid the results weren't going to be perfect, like the standard boob-jobs, so he wasn't going to try it. Since insurance has to cover recon after BC, MX with immediate recon could be an option.  I can't imagine that it would be too much more uncomfortable that having the tissue messed with to have the recon only.  I had a lot of scar tissue cut away during my first recon surgery.   You need a good surgeon because I think you will feel better, physically and mentally when you get this issue taken care of.

I never got the exhaustion I was told would come with rads, but I didn't have time for it.  I had to put in my Energizers and keep going, and going, and going. Best of Luck, Meece",

Eph, I used to get mine done in March (Birthday thing) then I had to move to the six month, and had them in October (BC awareness, which by the way is stupid, because i am aware of it every month) but then a finding on a 6 mo check up moved it to September and to six mo.  Now stupid finding January moved it to February and...what's six months from Feb?  Oh, yeah, August.

Sorry, for sort of ranting.  I just  was curious how careful can drs be? (I am not complaining, just worried if she is thinking something needs this immediate attention.)  It seems so many times insurance holds the purse strings like a noose and we have to fight to get the best answers.  ",
