After results came back with BIRAD 4b suspicious microcalcification clusters in right breast I was sent in to have a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound. Reading was confirmed with BIRADS 4b Likelihood of malignancy is intermediate. Was referred to a breast specialist who ordered a Stereotactic biopsy of two separate clusters. After waiting for several days report came back as : Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia, Low grade intraductal carcinoma cannot be ruled out. Microscopic calcification seen in ductal and lobular units. Sclerosing adenosis and second area was given a diagnosis of Hyalinized Fibroadenoma with associated calcifications. I am scheduled for Lumpectomy next week where they are only going to remove the one cluster area. Should I be concerned that there is no concern of moving the second area that came back benign?
