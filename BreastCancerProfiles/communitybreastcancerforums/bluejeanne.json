Results should be in 10/9/2015 just a few days from now. I am going back to work on Tuesday, had bilateral mastectomy on August 4. Have had 4 fills so far in expanders. I was with 3 different friends when they died of this disease in the 70's and 80's. I find myself crying for no reason, except stark fear. So terribly worried that I do not have the strength at my age to get through the chemo and work. I am 65. DX 7/08/2015 ILC: 1cm stage 1 grade 1 Surgery 8/04/2015 Bilateral mastectomy ",
