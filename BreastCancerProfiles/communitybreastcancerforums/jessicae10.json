      "Content": "jessicae10 wrote: Hi, I'm new to this site. My mom is 48 and was diagnosed with breast cancer on 11/29 after a suspicious mammogram on 10/18. Her lump was 17 mm, grade I, invasive ductal carcinoma. She recently had a lumpectomy on 12/19. They removed 1/4 of her breast and 2/14 nodes were positive. She needs to have a re-excision because of positive margins. Her surgeon said she wants to wait another month before doing it so my mom's breast will heal, but I'm concerned that her cancer will spread (especially since it was in the nodes) within a month. And waiting will delay when she starts chemo, too, because she will need to recover from that surgery. Is a month too long to wait for the re-excision? I have read that chemo is usually started as soon as possible (within weeks) after surgery if the lymph nodes are involved. I'm very worried, and think that the surgeon is inept. She is a general surgeon, not one that specializes in breasts. She didn't tell my mom to stop taking birth control when they found out the tumor was estrogen and progesteron positive! I researched and told her myself.  Also, do you think it's a good idea to switch to another surgeon who specializes in breats and will do the surgery earlier (if possible)? My mom doesn't have a general oncologist. Her surgeon has been telling her what to do in relation to her cancer. My mom has to start planning chemo, so I guess her chemo doctor will become her oncologist. Sorry this is a lot to read. I'm just a very concerned daughter (to make up for a very lax doctor!). Thanks for your help in advance. Log in to post a reply",

I called my mom's primary care physician and she has referred her to a breast surgeon for a second opinion. It's kind of a hassle because my mom is getting angry at me for suggesting all these changes. She doesn't like change, but I know it's best for her. Again, thank you all for your help. You're the best.",
