There is a thread called \"Ottawa Ladies?\" but it isn't very active. I was where you are about 18 months ago.....You get caught upin this \"vortex\" when things start happening and it all seems pretty overwhelming. Definitely bring an extra set of ears to your surgeon appointment and to the first appointments with MO and ROs should you end up having to go down that road too. I only found out the type of BC post biopsy. The grade, stage and hormone receptor info came after surgery. There is really no normal when it comes to BC. It takes a bit for it all to sink which will come once you get biopsy results. Feel free to ask any questions about how things work in the Ottawa area. Good luck!",

What I'm wondering is how I will be able to go back to do things I usually do with people who don't know what I've been through and not wearing a wig or winter hat? Most people thought my wig was a new hair cut. I didn't correct them unless they really went on about it. Obviously, no one would have hair like my current hair on purpose.

Are you taking all of the anti nausea medicine that has been prescribed for you? My chemo nurse gave me the advice that if my nausea got to 3 on a scale of 10 start taking the meds! It's easier to prevent it than get rid of it once it starts. There are things that you can do if the nausea is really bad so ask your MO or chemo nurse. I didn't find it cumulative but the same every time. I think that I got better prepared knowing what to expect, drinking lots of fluids and lying down every few hours during the day. Taxol weekly was a walk in the park for me compared to AC. I had trouble sleeping the first night due to the steroids and achiness 2-3 days later. I walked every day which helped with that.
