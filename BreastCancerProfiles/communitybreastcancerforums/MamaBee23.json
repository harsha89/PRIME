Breast surgeon has refused to do an MRI as it would slow down my excisional biopsy surgery date for the lump they've already found. (Surgery is on my 8 year wedding Anniversary...in just under 4 weeks.) I still have another huge lump in that same breast and lumps in the right breast as well. I will be having a follow up bilateral breast ultrasound in 5 days. No nipple discharge test. No other scans :( I've never had surgery before either and they're putting me under anaesthesia...I'm scared. I have an appointment with an internal medicine specialist in 4 days to discuss all of my symptoms and try and get more specialist appointments and tests. Hooefully MRI's of my breasts, pelvis and abdomen! This is CRAZY-making!!!! How does anyone survive this?!!! I'm losing my mind! I can't stop crying, I have no patience and just one glance at my son can send me sobbing. How did all of you cope in the waiting stage?",

      "Content": "MamaBee23 wrote: Sorry friends....this is long winded...but I feel like the background is important. I've felt unwell for 3 months. Started with discomfort in my right pelvis, lower back, abdomen and flank/back. (Slight burning sensation when I would bend and general achiness) Thought it may be a kidney infection starting. Went to emergency....no findings. I couldn't eat. Had brutal digestive issues. More tests, no findings. Gastroenterologist appt booked for Sept 21st....3 1/2 months after issues began. Had a pelvic/internal ultrasound...technician came back to room because they lost some images...and needed additional images of \"enlarged right ovary\" to assess flow. 2 1/2 hour wait in ER and results never came through the computer system. ER doctor called for results....a few fibroids outside of the uterus...benign looking and a thick uterine lining. When I received the final report...no mention of the \"enlarged right ovary\". Gyne appt, pap, swab and uterine biopsy...small benign polyp in uterus. Rest all clear. Pain has been intermittent for last 3 months...now much worse and consistent. I visited the ER 9 times (I hate hospitals and am not a hypochondriac...I have to be truly scared and feeling unwell to go there....I am terrified of needles!) Bloodwork was always pristine. Ive lost 30lbs...the first 25 was in the first month of feeling unwell. I've begun drinking nutritional shakes to stop the weight loss. I did have the weight to lose though and carry about another 30 to 35lbs that I could still lose. Last visit to ER was in July sometime. I found a large lump under my left ribs. Would often get a burning/stinging pain there when I would bend. Ultrasound diagnosed as benign fatty lipoma thickening. My pain and digestive issues were horrible. Could still barely eat and I was never hungry. I began staying with family so they could help take care of my 3 year old son. Fast forward a month and my son went to rest his head down on my chest: I felt a tender spot. Felt around and found a very large thickening/lump at 12 o'clock in left breast. Developed more pain in breast as well as in left side of neck, shoulder, ribs (under and to the side of breast), underarm as well as around back and under/near shoulder blade. Aching, burning, stinging that has progressively become worse and is now consistent with no relief. Burning stinging a little less...aching more. A doctor also found another lump at the 2 o'clock position. Went in for Mammogram and was told everything was all clear. I pushed for an ultrasound. Tech was certain there was nothing there but some small cysts. I kept showing her where to look. She almost gave up until I turned completely on my side and then she found it. An irregular, hypoechoic mass. 4 1/2cm x 2.2cm x2cm. It was the one at 2 o'clock. She knew right away that the radiologist would want a biopsy. I was scheduled for an US guided core needle biopsy 5 days later due to a long weekend. Found out it was a bi rads 5. Radiologist cried with me and said \"I'm so sorry\". The large tender mass at 12oclock has not shown in either mammo or US....but is getting larger and more painful. Two days after core needle biopsy of mass at 2oclock, (6 samples) received phone call saying it was FEA. Viewed by two pathologists and they have never seen it present as a lump before...especially such a large one. Referral to breast surgeon for excisional biopsy however consult appt is for well over a month after biopsy result. I guess the \"benign\" finding is not a rush. I'm SO frustrated because they are not looking at the WHOLE picture and are instead focusing on only the one lump and biopsy result. I feel as though this is spreading or is already metastatic. The pain in my breast and surrounding areas is horrible....as is the pain in my right lower back, flank, abdomen, hip and pelvis. It wakes me up at night and I also can't function normally throughout my day. Oh...also forgot to mention that I have yellow discharge from only one duct in my left nipple and antibiotics did not help. It is a small amount and only happens when I squeeze. I also get a slight swelling/raised puffiness of the areola just around the nipple from time to time. Still no appetite. Tire easily. I've been visiting different doctors just to get the tests I want because I don't feel that my GP is taking this seriously enough. She has suggested multiple times that my symptoms could be stress related. (However, stress doesn't create a 4 1/2 cm bi rads 5 breast mass, overnight) I've pushed for another requisition for a bilateral targeted breast ultrasound to try and get this huge 12oclock lump to show up on screen. I've also pushed for a repeat pelvic ultrasound to check the ovary and surrounding area, as the pain has become so strong that it makes me nauseous at times. Pelvic ultrasound is tomorrow morning. Bilateral targeted breast ultrasound is on Sept.6th. Will try and get in sooner though via cancellation list. I would love advice or info from those who have had similar symptoms/findings. I'm pushing hard in every way to get answers. I have my 3 year old to fight for! He needs his Mommy...and I need him! ðŸ˜”ðŸ’™ Log in to post a reply",

Apparently fibrous mastopathy is usually found in premenopausal women with long term type 1 diabetes. I am not aware of having diabetes but will be tested this week. FEA is not usually found as a mass/lump on ultrasound so I will be having an excisional biopsy. I have a second ultrasound scheduled for a bilateral targeted breast scan. Praying the very large, painful, growing mass at 12 o'clock appears on screen. Transvaginal/pelvic ultrasound came back normal today... So no explanation yet for the intense pain in my right pelvis, hip abdomen and lower back. They have gotten me an earlier breast surgeon appt and my consult is now on Sept 1st instead of the 18th...I'm terrified but grateful! Hopefully I will have answers soon and a clear explanation of all of my symptoms that don't align with a benign or premarker finding. My anxiety is off the charts....but a tiny part of me remains hopeful that my diagnosis will be something non life threatening. If only the widespread pain would give me a break from having to think of it every second of the day. Thanks so much for your responses and support. Being a Mama to a wee one, the love amplifies my fear. Doing my best to be present with him and find beautiful moments in each day...even just for a few minutes of love and sanity",
