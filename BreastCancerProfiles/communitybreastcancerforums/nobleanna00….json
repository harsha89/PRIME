She pretty much said before Neulasta I was the perfect candiadte Who would have been put in isolation due to such low wbcs. So yeah I guess I need to welcome the pain lol!! I asked for something stronger but have a hard time with narcotics so we tried tylenol3 with codeine and it does seem to help. I just have a hard time sleeping when I take it so I space it out. Yes you would think the codeine would knock me out but it does not make me as hyper as the other meds I tried. And thank gosh steriods make my blood pressure go up and I turn bright red so I can't take them you want to talk about hyper! Oh well all these woos to get better. I guess we just need to remind ourselves that it won't last forever!!!                                               Bridget",

Right now I am on so many diffrent meds I am afraid to take anything extra. And I really want to be tested for so diffrent things via blood work and urine. Out of the blue yesterday afternoon. I got excruciating pain. I was okay in the morning and all of the sudden it just struck and I took a extra pain med with no let up. So called Dr. and he put me on something alittle bit stronger. It helped but not completley I had a long night. I feel better today its weird. It does this out of the blue happened a couple weeks ago and I ended up in the hospital, it feels like I have been run over. I can't wait until they can figure out whats up with this.          Oh here is another little drs. story a quick one. I was in the hospital a few weeks ago and was getting discharged. And we are a small community hospital and my primary care docs office is right next door. But she was actually in the hospital when I was being discharged by another dr. He told me she was here and she was going to set up getting me a hospital bed for home. I have just recentley switched to her but have seen her a couple of times found her smart and very nice. I could not believe it she never came in to see me the 2 days I was there. And to top it off to find out she is actually there in the hospital knowing I was their!! Whats up with that????? And then I had to call her office because my bed never came and they tried to cover it but I think they forgot. So now I don't know what to think of her. My former Dr. I had for 8yrs. and it was really hard to leave her but she was not part of this big practice where at least you can see someone if your not feeling well. And the few times I had called the office said I could come in 3 days later and I am like what I am sick today!!!!! So it was with alot of tears I had to leave but as we know with cancer you need to be seen when your sick and going thru chemo. My onc. is 2hrs away so I needed someone here in town. Now I am like what did I do!!!!!!!                                  Takecare all and lets hear those stories!!!!!!                                                           Bridget                           ",

I feel even little children will know something is wrong and their is know way to keep things normal. Things are going to change for you unfournatly and you just need to accept help when needed. And give lots of hugs and reassurance to your children and be strong and take all the help you can get. It is doable if you have the help.

But when I went back the next day to meet with my Rads Onc. they were able to hit the right markers. I guess I had so much swelling even in the back area they just could not line me up at any angle they would try. I am glad that they were on top of it and did't just say close enough. The lung area was very much a concern to them. Better safe then sorry. I love my Le OT she is great. She does not know how I slipped under the radar due to having so many lymphnodes taken out they usually make it a point to meet with you and give you a excersise plan right after surgery and go over LE facts. She is the one I would have met with. She was shocked that she was never given a heads up on it. Oh well what is done is done. Thats the way it has been from the start. I was diagnoised in Nov. 07 I should be finished with about everything but Herceptin. But I had many complications along the way. It is hard to keep your spirit up at times and this just seems to be one more thing on my already to full plate. I developed severe neuropthy do to the last round of chemo.Which basically after all the testing done at my neurologist he said you just need to deal with it and hope it goes away in the next few months, they have me on Lyrica to see if that helps plus pain meds. I live in a fog and I hate it!!!! Oh well hopefully it will get better. Thanks again and I am sure I will have more questions. I love my OT she is great. She is going to fit me with a compression sleeve and glove for flying. That should be intresting!!!                                                                            Best wishes-Bridget ",

My last muga scan went down 10% and I go for my next tommorow. Hopefully it has not gone down anymore due to the herceptin. I meet with the rad-onc. on Thursday so hopefully I will get some more answers. I know I have to do this due to her+++ and 5/27 nodes positive. I think it just freaked me out for a minute okay more then a minute. Hopefully they will take more precautions with me. I am also concerned cause I noticed that alot of you girls have had the exchange on the implants and I am still with expanders due to having one being removed unfournatley its not on the radiated side that was taken out. They won't even do a mri with it in so I amwondering about it in while they radiate. Just another issue I guess. I just wish at times everything was over and things could go smoothly, I am one of those people that got every se from surgery thru chemo. I am now dealing with neuropthy which is so painful and I have been waiting to get into a spinal neuroligist which was suppose to be set up for me which they did set up mri but as I said I can't have one so the ball kind of got dropped. And my onc. was the one setting things up for me and I don't even know the drs. name. So I called this morning and they were kind of like I think your the one who needs to make the appt. how can I when I don't even know the drs. name. I guess I got lost in the shuffle glad I called. I am unable to work at this point do to the fact that I need to be on my feet for 7-8 hrs per day. And I really want to get off pain meds. they don't agree with me. I hate this so much I just want my life back to normal but I have such a long road ahead that I am feeling depression creeping in. Yes I am on lexapro but its getting harder to stay positive. And I really have tried to keep my life as normal and upbeat as possiable but sometimes it just gets to me. Sorry to vent so much!!!!

I chose to have a bilateral masactomy because I am very fibercystic in both breasts and felt befor being diagnoised it was just a cyst that needed to be aspirated. My onc. feels its being growing for awhile and my surgery was not schedule until 3 weeks from diagnosis. They said don't stress its been there for awhile and awhile longer is not going to make that diffrence. Because you really need to think about whats best for you. My decesion was easy because of the cysts and I did not want to worry about it all the time. I had my surgery and reconstruction done at the same time. Unfortunatley I did have some problems with one expander and had it removed but I am still glad I chose it he will be able to fix after radiation. I am going through 4 rounds of A/C everyother week. Then I go on taxol with herceptin for 12weeks 1 aweek. Then rads and weekly herception shots which I have to have for 40 weeks. Long road but I am 43 and have young children and I really want to do everything I can!. I am also stageIIIa This time right now that your going through is the hardest and learning all tose terms and labs etc etc isvery overwhelming at times so post often and ask any question. Someone will always have a answer for you.

I have been told by my BCOnc. That I should think about getting one this is back when I was first diagnoised and sense my Gentic Counsoler also said I should consider it. Yet its not in my TX plan nor is the shots. I had not started menapause when I was diagnoised never had much of a period anyways before all this. Since Chemo I have not had one. It will be a year in July since the end of chemo. So Its not looking like I am getting it back, unless the Herceptin has kept it at bay. Which is unlikely. So my question is is it because I don't have a period is the reason I am not being giving the shot or having my overies out????? I go to my MedOnc. this Friday and she hates to be question about her TX plans so I don't want to ask if the reason is simply due to no period.

I just think People feel like she should move on and at certain instances that may be true but looking at her perspective I feel she has every right to keep looking into things and I truly hope she does not have BC cause I would certainly would not wish it upon ANYONE.  We are here for people that will be diagnoised and people who will walk away with a B9 results. She has found comfort here and this is what this is for to ask question's and try to find the answer's. This website has given me so much imformation over the past year and a half I am thankful for stumbling onto it.    Before I was diagnoised I wouldn't have thought twice about my lumpy cystic breasts but I have now become very intuned with my body and will NEVER AGAIN let things just GO!!!!! My friend was very proactive in her mammo's and until her nipple started inverting and they took biopsie after biopsie she finally was diagnoised with stage 3 IDC and just under went a Bilateral Masact. And I pray to god each day that she will be alright and its been very hard to watch her go through what I had just completed but her's was a very sneaky kind no lump and hidden deep. She was diagnoised in Nov. and just started chemo. And like JennyWren has said although she disagrees with Angel it took her awhile and then they were 99% certain it was not BC.     So my thought is why are some of you attacking her for some of the reasons she has written or have defended herself, I truly hope she finds out soon and it turns out to be nothing. But is that a reason not to support her either way??????       I am not looking for a word fight but really read her posts she has never said anything negitive about anyone here only thing she has done id defend herself. I may be slammed for this but its not right.      Angel you hang in there and alot of us are thinking of you! Bridget ",

I am proud of you for not giving up and sink into a depression cause you couldn't get the help needed. Not everyone is as aggresive as some, namely myself but I am learning quick that we are our on best advocates!!! I have had Drs. that won't listen and Drs. that were great!! I still don't have a true answer for my legs! but I do know it started with Chemo!!! So its a process of elmination.I too am on State Insurance now due to not being able to work in a year and a half. So I do know the process of seeing a specialist is not as quick as regular Insurance. You would have been proud of me today I was armed with paperwork etc. to see my Onc. Cause I wanted some answer's to why I was not getting Lupron shots or my Overies out since I was 100% positive for ER plus being stage 3 It seemed like alot of the women were getting these things and I was not. The power of reading this WebSite!!! So anyways she said yes on the overies and the uterus. She said she was happy I was asking for this. I felt like saying HELLO you are the one who put me on just Tomixfen, and never brought up removing anything or getting shots to shut the overies down. See what I mean!!! If I had not come on this site I would have never known that my treatment plan was not as good as it could be. Plus I learned about the DIEP Reconstruction because of this site never was told about it by my plastic surgeon. Its crazy. This is why we come Cancer or not cause we all have diffrent symptom's!!!!! I wish you well! Jenny- By know means did I mean disrespect to you! But like you said it took a full year until you were properly diagnoised. And I am sorry I did not know that part of your journey. I am just saying that some cases as in your's took awhile to get to the bottom of it. Did you wait in the ER until you got your answer's???? I just think instead of slamming her your words could have been alittle more encouraging. This is in the section of Not Diagnoised But Worried and happily alot of women who have gotten support from this thread have moved on cause they were B9!!!  Angel is looking for support and maybe some clues to what's happening with her, and I just believe we should always support someone in the time of need. I just don't understand what your getting at. No she has not gotten answer's yet she has been on anibiotic's etc gone to other specialist, and if I was her I would want to know what the darn thing is. And I am sure as you were she is just as frustrated. Jenny I know you have been through alot as we all have and we just need to give to other's sometimes as I tried to help you. I am saying all this with total respect and am not looking for a word fight if she bother's you so much why are you reading and writing on her post???? I know I wouldn't. But we need to come together as Sister's to try to help where we can!!!                                                  Hugs-Bridget",

Unbelievable. Sorry for my rant but as you sometimes their is no ryme or reason to whats going on but we have to push till someone can figure it out!!! Thats what I am looking to do.

Whether its something else or cancer we are HERE!!!!!!! Jenny- That was not called for at all as a person I care when people don't feel well and have symptoms of BC. Whether its BC or not and alot of cases are not so cut and dry like maybe your was or mine. Expample my BF just got diagnoised in the first of Jan. She just had a bilMasact. Thats along time from diagnosis. Her path reports were confusing and all she wanted is to get it out!! She ended with BC in both breasts 22 lymphnodes positive. And she was going to my Onc. Surgeon, and switched thank-god she did. So you see its not always what you think you may have or not have. And I am a perfect example also I was not one bit scared of the 5cm tumor I had I thought it was a cyst cause yes it hurt!!!! Not to scare others!! I was very fibrocystic so I thought it was just that and needed to be aspirated! Low and behold it was CANCER Stage III so I just caution you that  sometimes like you have needed us will to and all we can is support that person whether its B9 or BC we hope for B9 for each of these people going through this and alot come out B9 but that did not stop us from reaching out. I know she has gone to alot of Drs. but she has not had the puzzel solved yet. I know I would and have done the same. I have been to every Dr. under the sun for lower back and leg pain. Yes I have neuropthy but as the neurolgist has said I am not having it in the normal ways which chemo causes. So on to a Rheum. No its not a autiomune disease. Been to a Ortho, No its not a bone or muscle related. My pain specialist said nerves are hard to treat and diagnose. This has ended me up in the hospital twice for 2-3 days at a time to get the pain under control. My back and legs look like I have been beaten severely cause I lay on heating pads. You can stick a needle in my leg and I can't feel it and the shock it. So no things are not easily solved. Do I still have my answer somewhat but not really!!!! I have always tried to help you Jenn and cared about you! And I feel its our turn to give back just my thoughts!!!!!! Good-luck Angel if you have any doctor appointments this week!

I really think their should be a class where family members who are close to you and are your caregivers to teach them that what we go thru and how long these side effects can last in our bodies. Just because we are through with treatments does not mean we still are not feeling the effects. I have a very good nurse practioner at my onc.

I had a miscarriage and after wards asked them to check my thyroid do to that and the se of thyroid disease. Sure enough I was a high 18.  Since my diagnoises of cancer this is the weird part it has not gone up and down like it has.

Definatly have lasting effects from this all. I still after 3 yrs need more reconstruction, Hystroctomy, etc. feels like its never ending, and until its all done it is always hanging over me. I could care less if I only had one breast done but having 2 and one being rejected and having side effects from chemo etc. sucks!! I feel like by the time I have everything done I will be facing it al over again. Not trying to not feel positive but realisticllay it will come back at some point. We never know!!!!

How do they know if they got everything or I am do not have bone mets. I live on pain meds to get through. I am a very strong person and I truly do not want to be on meds all the time, I can barely work do to my type of employment. I just don't understand how they would know if I have never even had any other tests other then what I had. Its all very frustrating and as you can see it is stressing me out. My boss who's son has cancer has gone through multiable cts, pet, you name it. He is so surprised I have not had any that he wants me to go to NY. but I have a family here and I just don't want to be away from them. When I get more imfo on the bone marrow test I will post it, I was just told about this yesterday by a women who went through this several years ago, she had the test done of course her onc. is in NY, figures!!!! I don't know I go tommorow but will only see the NP but I really get along with her and she really listens so I think I will bring it up again to her. My onc is nice but sometimes I wonder she does not like to be questioned I almost switched but had already delayed chemo by 2mos do to surgeries and infections. So I stuck with her and she has gotten better when I have seen her she knows how much and how hard its been for me, she just is not a person I feel oh I can ask you anything.,like I do with my NP. I will keep you posted and thanks again for the response.                                                              Bridget ",

I am suppose to be at the first rate breast center and I travel 2hours to get there because of that but now I am questioning there way of doing things. Just reading on the discussion boards I am like why did they not do that or why did they not scan me. I am going to voice my fears tomorrow when I go for tx and hopefully they will listen!!!! Because as you all say its my life they hold in their hands right now and to be honest they are scaring me. I just don't feel right and that kittle intuition is setting it off, or maybe I am just reading to much! We will see I guess.

My problem is I was told by someone who works for the State That I should apply for The BreastCancer Treatment act. Due to the mounting med bills and high insurance premium since my DH is self employed.And unfournatly I had so may issues I had to give up my job. So We applied and I got accepted and we dropped me off my insurance in Dec.08 Never expectig and I had kind of put it out of my mind until I saw BC Surgeon who reminded me, and she got me a appointment. Called the State they said yes its covered. My GEN. Dr. said yes they pay for you to see me but not the test. What the heck! Then why should I have even bothered going if they are not going to pay for the test. I am at high Risk and have 2 children one girl one boy so I need to get this for their sakes and my own. I have had the bilateral but she strongly suggests I get my overies and fallopian tubes removed. Now I am scared I have not had a period since chemo in March08 and they are surpressing it now with tamoixfen. I just don't know what to do I have a Diep coming up in the spring so maybe after all Tx is finished and surgeries I will go back on insurance. But as you all know my deductiable is as High. So any suggestions would be great! ",

The downfall to it is it does cover you for 5yrs if you qualify. Rest of your life if you have recurrence. Downside you have to have no other insurance. I myself was on a State program with my family that is for self employed people here in Maine. I could and can still have the that insurance but it is based on your income and we were still paying $1400.00 a month for it and it does not have good prescription coverage and of course all your copays ect.I am due to have reconstruction soon out of state and have been approved for a Diep so I really want to stay on this program, We are just so in debt with all the Med bills. Of course I did not know about this program until I had reached my Max out of pocket. So we are really trying to get them paid down and not add any others. When I can go back to work hopefully I can put money aside for this test. I also hear on Force boards that you can appy for assistance so I may try that. I know how crazy insurance issues can be. It seems like every surgery I have happens in Dec. so I have to start from scratch again.This has been a godsend for me. This is what stinks is once your diagnoised know one wants to insure you. The one I had will at anytime I am very lucky that way. But with all the cutbacks we are hoping it does not get cut. Living is tough right now everything costs so darn much. And its going to get worse before it get better I am afraid.                                    Thanks again for replying!!!!!",

A good job but it requires alot of energy and the thing is I can't predict how I am going to feel with the first round of chemo or second or rads. And like you I live in the New England area which adds to it constant snow cold weather just adds to the I don't want to go anywhere. But When I first got diagnoised I made a pact with my girlfriends do not let me sit in this house make me go out whether I want to or not. They also help me with cleaning and wash my hair when I needed it etc. Although I have a great hubby he has to work so the friends really help and when they say please let me help you you need to let them do something believe it or not your not putting them out people love to help others like you said yourself that you do. Let them be there for you good friends are awsome and it sounds like you have some good ones. I have cried I have looked a mess and also have been okay in frount of them they will accept whatever needs you have at the momment. I just had a port put in yesterday and I so not want to go out due to bandages but oh well I have somethings I need to do and can't postpone it due to another lovely storm coming up the coast. I know people will look some may ask how I am doing but I have been right upfrount with my illness from the start there was no sense in hiding it I live in a small town and you can't imagine the stories that would go around if I didn't. lol!!!!! And believe it or not people I don't even know have sent cards and prayers its awsome to know people that you may only have breifly met have put you in there thoughts. Its hard to go out at first but please go I went to all my sons basketball games as much as I was feeling up to it.

I am going to give it a try thats all I can do and if I fail I will try again. I did it once and it was hard but not as bad as I thought.

I am such a die heart smoker that it can be a snowstorm outside or below 0 and I stll go out. I don't smoke at all in my house.

I am the same way I hate to hurt anyones feelings but I think cancer does something to us it makes us realize we need to advocate for ourselfs and not take the crap and insults and cold heartness of some doctors. I switched my PCP after seeing her for 12 years and I truly loved her but hated her office staff they were rude and not proffessional at all. I complained once to her and things were suppose to be better and they were not so I called her and told her right now I need to think of my care and I can not get it there. She understood. That practice has lost so many clients due to there frount. They finally fired them but a little to late. We live in a small community and word gets around. I also will never see my neurologist again he always was not warm and fuzzy thats okay but he was down right rude to me. And made me feel stupid and I got to crying. how embarassing but he was hammering me with questions and I had just completed chemo and I had a hard time thinking and he was relentless to I finally broke down. Then he had to do the nerve and needle test I bet he was smirking the whole time but the joke was on him cause I couldn't feel a thing!!! LOL!!!!!!!!! I told my doctors if they need to send me to a neurologist not him. Even though I had him for all my arm issues but this was diffrent he was late beyond words and he was in a bad mood. But he needs to learn to have compassion. I almost wrote a letter also but then was like let it go!! Me the one who usually will put up with anything and hates hurting peoples feelings but I have definatly changed. And my Oncologist is going to be next if she does not get those scans ordered that was suppose to be the 1st of the year and I have caled yadayada . They are usually really good. But they better hope I do not have mets. Which is in my head since I have developed severe lower back pain, and she would not scan me to this month. Cause in her book I had a clear scan and there is know wway its moved that qick, hello I had no contrast in it cause they could not get it in. DOCTORS!! they drive me crazy! Love, Bridget ",

I have smoked for 30yrs and to be honest I wish I hated it but I am one of those who loves to smoke. I only smoke around 15 a day I have cut back from my usual pack.

I had abraxne instead of Taxol cause the decadron they gave me the first few times of the A/C drove my blood pressure way up. Abraxne is a gentle type of Taxol I did really well on it and only had to do 4 TX instead of the 12 with Taxol. I think because I decided to have a bilateral is why they did not try to shrink the tumor first. It was pretty big. Where they have taken the lyphmnodes out make sure you ask them about Lymphedema and excersises to get your range of motion back. Cause you will need it for the Rads. I was not told and slipped through the cracks and my O/T was livid cause she says she works directly with clients after they have had that many nodes taken out and she was shocked I was not given any excersises. So if they don't bring it up ask about it. I really hope your lumpactomy works out for you. I also had that choice but due to very dense breast which was in both and also fibrocysts I elected to just taken them off. I seriously thought it was just a cyst that needed to be drained. I will never forget the look on the techs faces cause I went down to my small local hospital where everyone knows everyone and I knew by their faces. And the tears in their eyes.       And don't worry if you end up with a masactomy reconstruction has so many options. I am excited I am having a DIEP  and I will get a tummy tuck and new perky breasts to boot. Its a long procedure but they use your own fat which I have definatly have required since they have thrown me into menapause!!!!! 20lbs I can't believe it. Now when I quit smoking I know more will come on no matter if I live on carrott sticks!! LOL!!!!!!       Your Surgeon is full of B.S. It happens to people who don't smoke as it does for the ones like us who do. Is it better not to YUP!!! But you know what with all the stress and other stuff is it like you said better that you quit probably not and she or he should respect that. I had a failed expander and my smoking could have caused it but I know others that have had the same thing happen or worse and they didn't smoke so who the heck knows!!!!! And I am sorry if you feel more comfortable getting a masactomy then I would find another surgeon but if your okay with your decesion then stick with it. I don't understand that surgeons thought process they still have to go in there and cut it out whether its a lumpactomy or a masactomy you still will heal the same way regardless. Thats crazy!!!!       I am sorry that you had to learn on your daughters Birthday but look at it this way each year your NED you throw a double party in your honer also!! And you will have many!

As we have sadi and you have read the sideeffects are so much easier now. I won't lie and say there is none but they have been manageable for me. I had a bilateral masactomy with immediate reconstruction cause at 43 I could not imagine waking up with nothing. Although it was much more of a recovery and I ended up after 2months having to have one expander removed, my great luck!!! So I do know how you feel now but with luck I can have the expander put back in lucky for me it was on the other side which won't receive the radiation. I just completed my 3rd A/C which was everyother week. I have one more to go yey!! They say the next round of my chemo treatment will be easier I hope. I will be having 12weeks of Taxol/Herceptin every week. So yes this is a hard road but with good family and thinking positive thoughts really can bring you through this. Another hint When you know your date your starting your chemo join that months group. They usually start one up for your month and year, and they will be going through pretty much what you are and you will meet some great people. And if you read the treads of the past ones who as you can see still chat with one another you will get some great tips on diffrent things. I wish you luck and keep your chin up it is doable!!!                                               Bridget",

And they veiw the lumpactomy as good as a total masactomy. I like you did not want to ever think about going back into surgery and with a lumpactomy you can have multiable surgeries. I also have fibrocysts and very dense breast tissue in both. So it was a no brainer for me. I did not want to be scared silly with each lump that showed up, I sadly lost one expander and after having to do Rads I have decided to do the DIEP route ans will be going to Boston next week for a consult. My state does not offer this procedure. And I really had to make a quick choice for reconstruction or find nother surgeon out of state. And I really liked both my Surgeon and PS. It just did not work out for me. I have never regretted my choice.

But with my line of work it just did not work.My nereve conduction tests were high so the recommended cure was to unimpinge those nerves and he was going to see what was causing the tendon to swell and be so tender I could barely lift things in a certain way. Oh well I am glad to hear from Binney that it is possiable. And I know my LE therepist would be more then willing to help. She is the one that suggested it would not be a good idea but I had not given her all the details that I have shared with you. I see her next week so I will speak with her more about this issue.                                                      Thanks again-Bridget",

They are going to do it next week. My neropthy seems to be better with the dosage being put up. I worked last night for 6 hrs. on my feet and when I got home my legs were trembling. So I don't know I feel I need to work and be there because I am a manager but the way they do it you work on top of it. I can't just sit there and over see. And communicating with them is tough due to they are chinese. But my staff needs to see me there and vent!! or change scedule so its kind of hard. I feel just lucky they have kept me on and let me take time off when needed. Although as you can see I have the case of major guilts even though I still do my part of the paper work and whats need to be done for the week. I hope you do well with your next tx and do not get more neropthy. And I hope mine does not come back full force again.                           Thanks for listening! Bridget               ",

I know I have to I have no choice if I want to try to stay healthy.

I hate being sick and have been a pretty healthy person for the most part and this has thrown me for a loop!!!!!!! Does anyone know how long the combo treatment Adrizmycin&cytoxan takes at each treatment? I know some are shorter then others, If its longer then 2hours it will drive my husband over the edge he has a hard time sitting for a hour not that he wouldn't do it for me but I think I would rather not torture him like that well maybe I do if he does not do the dishes enough lol!!!!!  I hope everyone is feeling well. I am going to go shopping for some chemo bag stuff like books on tape and I might splurge and buy a portable dvd player so I can watch movies, I did have 2 that the kids got a couple of years ago but I think they are both broken by now!!

I just posted on the reconstruction site but maybe one of you ladies can answer one of my questions. I had expanders put in when I had my bil. masactomy and had to have another surgery in Jan. due to a hematoma and some dead skin at that time my ps had to take some fluid out, but ever since my expander on that side has seemed harder then the other one which is softer and has more fluid and not so painful. I just chalked it up to swelling and surgery but it keeps getting harder and then had the port put in that side last week, so I just thought again the same thing now its really hard and painful mishaped no redness or fever so its not infected and the ps has wanted to do a fill but I am afraid there is something going on in there. Made a appointment with the ps for Friday so hopefully its not something bad or another surgery cause I have already delayed chemo once and I don't want to again. Hopefully!!!!! anyone know what this could mean??????         I sent my wig back today and they charged me 39.04 for restocking charge am not happy about that and it needs to be back there in 10 days for them to make the exchange, So of course I did a 2 day delivery which cost me more money there return policy really stinks and I feel is very unfair. I never even tried it on, and its not like I had it for a month. I will not do business with them again!! I checked other wig sellers and there policy for exchange is not like that. I was told this was a good company to deal with. I wrote them a letter and told them exactly how I feel about the whole situation. Even the girl I talked on the phone with said they have had some problems with that wigs color not showing how much of the redness. I am so mad about it and what I had to pay and the time I had to put into return it cause it had to be just right I had to have the code to return it so I had to call then print out and fill in a paper and ship it back and to find out the wig I thought I bought for 120.00 is going to end up costing me $200 ooooh that makes me so mad!!!! Oh well  I will eventually get over it. Its not the money its princiable to me. Well enough of my boo hooing!!! think positive everyone!!!                                                   Bridget",

I am starting the 21st A/c for 4 weeks and then TX/herceptin for 12 weeks and then rads36 times with the herceptin which I have to have for a full year. I was really bummed because I thought I would need another surgery and have to delay my chemo which I did not want to do!! Its more important to survive this then have boobs at this point. They are taking some of the fluid out in hopes it relieves some pain which it did but I already can feel it filling up again, but as far as I am concern it can go flat I am going ahead with chemo cause I need to fight for my life and reconstruction is the least thing on my list at this point. They agree (the ps) as long as I don't develop infection I can put this on hold. I hope everyone has a great week-end and are feeling the good vibes!!! and I love the name Feb. Fighters!!!!!

I had such a hard time this past tx and I am still not up to par. Very tired and just feel blah!!!!! I really hope Taxol will be more kind to me!!!!  And I really hope tx 4 won't kick me in the butt as bad. Ugh 3 months more of chemo it is kind of depressing to me, but I know I have to do it. It just stinks! Then I get to go on to Rads it just feels never ending. The Herceptin will be in my life for a year so its real hard to make any plans till after that. Although we will have to if my daughter qualifies for the Morgan Grand Nationals again. I guess we will just figure that out if she does.                     Update she is still in the singing contest and we are hoping for the 4th call back this week. She is doing awsome!!!! I am so proud of her. We are going to look for prom dresses after tx because usually that day they give you so many drugs you feel good. I am glad she is coming with me but a little nervous how she will react in the chemo room, I told her she does not have to come in if it bothers her. Although sometimes I feel that shes not getting it at 15 what her mom is going through she still likes to fight with me but I guess thats the age cancer or no cancer! Nolana I have expanders in and had one taken out do to problems but its on the other side of where I am going to get rads so they don't think its going to be a issue when they reinflate it. I never had to get filled cause I am really happy the size I am B/smallC my surgeon did a great job filling me when I had my bilateral. But as I see now nothing is as bad as chemo!

She also said that they had alot of money raised at the horseshow for BC. So yeah!!! I am getting really nervous about starting next tx whether its Taxol or another I really hope I will be able to work at least partime I know how bad the bone pains can be do to the reaction I have on nuelasta shot. And the A/C the fatigue just makes me ill, its like it sneaks up on me and all I can do is sleep it off. Wetcoast- The imfo I have gotten on Taxol from my onc. is that it does cause some fatigue and bone joint pain but not for everyone. If your redblood count is low you may be anemic which would make it worse depending on how bad it is . Mine is not enough to warrant a shot but enough to make me feel like crap!!! Ask your onc nurse to call in a perscription for Nystatin one you can swish and swollow if its in your throat one you just swish around in your mouth as long as you can and spit out. I have terriable sores and had thrush and it has made a huge diffrence for me. Cause I know its hard to eat or drink when your mouth is sore. I dropped 4lbs in 4 days and was very dehydrated when I had mine, so you really want to call!!!!! I can say one thing that has come from this awful thing we are going through is that I can say my dear husband and I who have been together since I was 19 and kind of drifted alittle apart him doing his stuff which is he is a firecheif for our community but he always goes far and beyond his duties which takes up alot of his time, and me with work work work!! I am a work aholic(sp) is we need to slow done and smell the roses alittle and spend more time as a family we are in the process of buying a camper so we can camp. Also my husband will come to more horseshows with us this year.Its not that he was not a family person its just there was something always coming up. Now we are like can't wait to spend time with our kids and go away and just be together that makes me so happy!!! I just need to get over the work issue. Which I am working on. So for me thats what I look at this was some type of wake up call to all of us and life gets so busy that we just take for granted there is another day or week year. Not anymore I am going to live my life to the fullest that I can.                              Of course I watched stepmom on t.v last night you want to talk about cry. Why do I tortue myself but I just had to watch it. She was such amazing mom and Stepmom!!!!!                                                                                         Takecare all- Bridget",

I am just glad to get started due to infections and 2nd surgery it put me behund schedule. My oncologist is giving me a few weeks extra time off due to being so wiped out from infections and surgeries so I am thankful for that. I had a bilateral masactomy with expanders put in on the 17th of Dec. Then developed a hematoma and infection but things are much better now. The first surgery was not bad at all. I think the expander problem bothered me the most. I cut my shoulder lenghth hair off first of January and believe me it took so long to grow it out my hair does not like to grow, but since my hair cut I have gotten so many compliments so that has made me feel better I even had fun with it and put a purple streak in it!!!! Now shaving it is going to be hard but I have a girlfriend who owns a shop which she grooms dogs yes you heard correctly she is going to shave it for me while we have a glass of wine!!!! I have ordered a wig that is close to my cut so hopefully it will look okay if it does not oh well I will just have to deal my life is more important. I asked for my numbers today cause I really was conteplating not doing chemo but due to my numbers its out of the question I am at a 50%-60% rate not good. I am stageIIIa er+/pr+ her-positive 5/27 nodes positive. so as you see I have a long battel ahead of me. I have 2 children one daughter who is 15 and a son 11 I have put them both in counseling for this to help them understand especially my daughter. She is really having a tough time acting out etc. my son has adhd and is very impulsive but he is also a mommy's boy so his way of showing stuff is to act out he can be a handful but also a sweet-heart. I really hope this helps my children because I love them dearly and I to am the rock of the family although my husband is great I am the one who does everything so life has turned upside down but hopefully it will even out soon. I look forward to talking with you all and try to help as much as I can. We will have our good days and bad I have had a few bad lately but now that things are moving forward I feel better but yet scared. Take care and lets talk often                                              Bridget ",

Everyone was so nice and attentive I hope you get the same, I didn't feel any pain good meds just a few stings from the lanicane. I am really glad I have done it since I will be having so many chemo treatments and a year of hercepton. I hope your muga scan goes well I had one also and was relieved to know my heart was healthy for all those good drugs we are going to get. I start chemo on the 21st I can't wait to get it going so my life can get in order and I will know how I will feel on it, the unknown is the worst. I have been getting my chemo bag together just ordered some cd books online and aportable dvd player, thats been fun, I love reading but get easily distracted if its not quite so I figured this would work well and the cds on ebay are very cheap. If I don't hear from you good-luck on yourtest and port don't worry its not painful and as alot of the girls have said very worth it. I have terriable veins and they can't use the right so I am happy I did it. Take care and you will be in my thoughts.                                                     Bridget",

But I had found out the scoop on her at PS they are so funny there and I asked them about her cause I was not calling that office I told them shes kind of moody and scary and I am not telling her let PS do it. The nurse said she heard that her husband is really ugly and grouchy which in turns makes her moody LOL!!! I am like okay I get it now. He must be a dr. too cause the offices of these 2 are in 2 diffrent towns so I don't know how they found out that!!! When I left onc office I said to my friend her husband must have been very nice to her last night because she gave me a pat and candy LOL!!! Now that I know the scoop on her boy am I going to have fun!!! hehehe! She can't be all that mean while I was there one of her former patients brought her a big bouquet and a basket of candy for the staff. She really isn't mean I don't mean it like that just not warm and fuzzy that day! I hope everyone else had a great day and it looks like I am not a FEB.

They changed my pain meds to tylenol3 with codine but I am still not getting sleep, oxycodone just makes me wired so they thought this would work better, I don't feel as wired but just couldn't sleep for long stretches could be the darn tube which is very uncomfortable under my lovely corset bra had my husband cut a slit where the tube is, which has seemed to make it not pull so much.

Welcome to the newcomers!!!! I can hardly wait to shave my head, forgot it probably would itch like crazy. Well I am not going to complain I will just be happy if they let me start chemo tomorrow!! cross your fingers for me & toes! Thank-god they put me off I have been so sick, I am finally feeling human again. I can't imagine what I would have felt like with chemo on top of the flu! Here is a little about me- I am 43 with 2 children my son is 12 and my daughter is a awful 15yr.old. (just kidding)! We have our momments but she is mostly a good girl. A wonderful husband that I have been with since I was 19 and married 5 yrs later he is great!!!!! I live in a coastal town of Maine so yes I do understand the snow, ice cold thing. We have 3 cats 2 dogs a bassethound whos name is Bubba, and a pomerian named callie who is my little angel. We can't forget pearlie the rat!!! she is cute believe it or not! And my daughter shows Morgan horses and unforunatley we just had to find a home for her morgan due to some lamness issues. Its somewhat ironic the place she went is so perfect and the lady assured me she would have a home for life, and that her mom is batteling BC right now also. I was so sad to have her go because we loved her dearly but knowing she is at a beautiful kind home makes it a lot easier. We just got a new member of our family for awhile we have leased a showhorse for my daughter named maestro which is so fitting since my daughter is so into music she plays fiddle, sings, guitar, does all the musicals and says she going to be on AmericanIdol someday will see. This year she got to sing the National Anthem at the Morgan Grand National which was held in Oklhoma City. What a honor for her. My son is all about sports!! and just being a busy boy but he does give his mom a kiss every morning and night hes a sweetie, Okay enough of the bragging up my kids can you tell that there everything to me. Thats why it makes me so sad this has happened in my life cause it hurts them to. But we are a good tough family and we will get through this with some bumps but we will get through it. I will let you know how tomorrow goes good or bad. Takecare everyone and I am so happy to get to know each and everyone of you!! We need to do a reunion someday to meet when all this stuff is behind us!!! I am thinking some nice warm place that has a spa sounds good right about now!!!!                                     Bridget       ",

I must have infection in there although I have been on double antibotics since Mon. I am going back to dentist at 11:30. I think my WBC. is still low and I am unable to fight anything. I am not eating much and am trying to drink but the infection is from the side of my ear into my throat so hard to swollow. I put a call into my onc. hoping she will send me down for a bloodtest to see where I am at and if I need some fluids of antibotics and electrolites. I am just plain weak and tired and sore! I hope others are doing better, I know I need to get boosted up before Mon. for 2nd tx of A/C If I am not well enough do they delay or can they delay without messing up the treatment plan. It figures this would happen. any imfo would be appreciated!                                              Hugs- Bridget         ",

I don't have to do them at home, Thank-god. They do a certain type of dose there that elimantes you from having to take it at home. The only side effects so far is very bad body aches started about 3hrs after treatment I feel like I have done 6 12 hr shifts running at the restraunt. I really hope this does not last to much longer. I am taking claritan and Motrin, does not help much. But other then that I feel pretty good I hope it lasts. When this pain goes away some I am going to respond to some of the comments. You girls are so funny and I love reading everyones messages I really look forward to it. And all the good tips I am getting you guys are the PROS!!! I did want to respond to Donnalee due to we have about the same diagnosies 4 A/C everyother week. I am getting Taxol after with herceptin for 12 weeks thenanother 40 weeks of herceptin. and of course rads in between. They never mentioned any other options to me. I wish they had cause I would go for shorter taxol due to work. We are very busy in the summer and this whole delay has brought me right smack into the middle of July. NOT GOOD!!!! I am going to ask about that next week or the following when I get to see the onc. I will let you know.

I am tired alot and its only been my first treatment of A/C they did say this is a tough one to have and I have 3 more to go GREAT! I was feeling so good that it just has thrown me for a loop that these last few days have been terriable. I am so tired I can't even standit but also not sleeping well on top of it I wake up alot. My mouth gets so sore and dry even though I have swished and swished I have not tried the baking soda wash can someone refresh me on what to do???? I have a terriable toothache on top of this so I am going to talk to onc today about getting it pulled. Rose- If the wig looks alittle long in frount I would take it to my hair dresser to trim up mine wore long in the bang area. Ps. I should have controled myself on the wigs they are hot and scratchy and I live in Maine. I am going more for the hats like everyone else. By the way Rose is my daughters middle name I love that name. Artee- I am so glad so far so good on the shot!!! yey good news!!!! Rachel- Yes I am going shopping again today for some hats!! LOL!!!! Nolana- I feel for you on the joint pain I am sorry this 2nd treatment has not been good as the first. I am scared the samething is going to happen to me on the next cylcle which will be a week away. Question for you ladies do you think its appropiate to wear a hat or scarf in the business of a restraunt or do you think it will make people uncomfortable if I don't wear my wig??? I know some people have such a problem with nose rings piercing etc. do you think this will bother them! My place of business keeps it so hot in there that even with my now bald head I was sweating under the wig!! And its not even summer. Thanks for any imfo. Thinking good vibes for us all!!                                                HUGS BRIDGET",

I had gone back to dentist because when novacaine wore off pain was right back plus worse. He pretty much said I had dry socket ( NOT )! went to ER and the doc there was not concerned at all about my face but kept asking me every other thing I said its my face, At least he got through to my onc. and she had them draw blood yey wbc was back up a positive. But my face was still hurting and swollen. Get this the final diagnosis from er dr. was due to cancer I can sometimes think things are worse then they are and I may have some depression going on!! I was so mad !!! Tears were streaming out of my eyes I wanted to say every swear word in the book to him! But DH gave me the look!!!lol! My husband is building a house for one of the er drs. He's great!!!! And I am going to call him and tell him what happened I am sure it will get back to the big guns there!!! I ended up seeing onc next day and was told in a second that I had a major bacterialfungal infection which is extremely painful. They gave me new meds and what a diffrence already, next day even. I had lost 3lbs since that mon. so they new how much it was affecting me. They are AWSOME! I just live so far away from them its hard for me to go and yes I try to solve my problems here at home. DUMB!!! I am in the middle of switching primary drs. due to this problem with not being able to get in. I am going to a practice where there is 6 drs. So I don't have to be told again to go to ER, and then be told after 5hrs with not even a offer of water or ice pack for face that I have depression! Now lets hope its healed enough so I can have my chemo today they may have to delay it for a few days they said. I hope not! I want to stay on schedule. Artsee- Thanks for the thoughts. So sorry about the snow I feel for you, since I live with it to. Ours is just about gone now where are in the rain faze but I am sure we will get that one more big one before spring! Grannie Rose- Thanks for thinking of me and I hope you had a nice Easter. Aurora- No sorry to say the toothfairy did not come. But the EasterBunny did! Donnalee- I am so sorry about redblct. mine isn't great either I was wondering what they do for tha, hope your feeling better. Pam- Do they have you on Emend? You should talk to your onc. or nurse about this asp! you should not feel this way! That is what has been said to me from my onc. I should have no sideeffects with meds. especially you should not be throwing up! We are on the same type of chemo A/C so ask them to change your meds!!! Chris- We must be on the same day I do chemo today also ( hopefully) good-luck feel good!!!!!! And to everyone else I am forgetting with that lovely new brain I have wishing you all the best and hope everyone ate lots of food yesterday!!!!                                                      HUGS- Bridget  ",

It could be I am just plain tired due to sick child and the infection I had last week. But its really hit me this time. Does it get harder tx after tx of A/C?         So far so good I have not caught the viral flu ,y son had for a week. But I know now is bad its when your wbc really dives so I am really keeping away from him and doing what Nolana said whereing a mask and washing my hands constantly and of course good old lysol spray I think its going to be in my senses of smell for ever. LOL!           I have been keeping a journal on how and what days are hard for me and its running a pattern that I get nausea on the 4th and 5th day. I hope not today due to I have to work. The pills help but I still get the morning sickness feeling at times even with meds. I force my self to eat. I hate eating right now. And I am with grannie Rose dry mouth!! and water is not cutting it!!! Okay I have whinned enough. The sun is out today and its beautiful. And I am going to just stay optimistic about the day and enjoy it. Even though I have to work. I love my job though and I have missed work so much that its a treat when I can! I hope I can keep up with eveything with this chemo brain going on!!!!                                      Takecare my friends, Bridget ",

Mine would be starting right around with you. GrannyRose- I wish there was some words or fairy dust I could sprinkle on you to help with your se but just keep thinking 3 more to go and I will be one step further. I felt awful on my 3rd A/C and said to myself how am I going to do the 4th then move on to more chemo. But this 4th knock on wood has not been as bad as the last SO FAR I might have just jinxed myself oh well. Hope today will be better. Di- Its amazing even when we are in pain we still as mothers try to shield our children from it. I did the same thing with the prom dress I just tried to make it a good day for my daughter even with the bone aches!!!!

I will be glad when first treatment is over and hopefully all our anxiety over it will be to. Heres hoping you go through this with a breeze!!!! Montazhnik - Welcome to our Feb club Your experience is invaluable to us. I am also doing A/C first the one thing I have been hereing is the cytoxin(sp) can give you terriable headaches if they infuse it to fast I am prone to headaches so I am going to take motrin before hand and make sure they go slow. What is a neulasta shot??? Alot of women are getting them and my onc. never mentioned it. Is it for specific types of BC? Just wondering if they are going to spring that on me tomorrow. I am getting emend also they say its great for nausa. When is your next treatment? NowWhat- I am rooting for you tomorrow and hopefully you will be able to start soon. I know the waiting has been driving me crazy!!! 40 Something Mom- I hope I am as lucky as you and get a good nurse it really does make a diffrence when someone takes good care of you. Good for you for having fun with shaving your head!!! I am going too also I am going to my goodfriend whos a dog groomer and she is going to groom me while we laugh and cry, she is so much like me we are sure to have all those emotions and she likes to cry and laugh at the sametime. We need to make it fun so we can make it less traumatic on us for the ones especially who love there hair ( which I do). I am not sure what I am going to do about outfitting the hair I have ordered a few wigs sent back 2 wrong color so hopefully they will get here soon. I work in the restraunt business and I just can't see me whereing a hat. Even though you can tell with some people they are whereing a wig oh well customers will have to deal!!!! They all know my situation anyways Boy the tips have been good when I have been able to work!!! I am also the restraunt manager so I need to be there some I hope I can swing it all, I do alot of paper work but I am trying to consolidate on Weds. with chemo on Thursdays. Takecare and good-luck with next treatment.                                        Bridget",

I am really upset right now I just got a call from my PS who was not there last Friday to check on my expander problem and he really feels that at this point if I have any pain at all that he thinks he needs to remove the expander before I start chemo. which means this is the 4th surgery in 3mos. and another delay on chemo!!! He said it should only delay it by a week but with my luck something else will come up. But I do understand where he is coming from I need to have a good immune system going in and as he said I should not have any pain at all right now. I am still sleeping in a recliner if that gives you any indication on pain level. It does feel better since they took fluid out but it feels like its filling back up slowly. I am just so tired already and I may have some infection going on in there so we will see. I have already lost 10lbs due to all the surgery and pain meds that make my appetite not good. I am just so bummed about tomorrow I just want to get going and I have had such a emotional week trying to prepare for this and wham he hits me with this. He says he will check it and we will talk more tomorrow about it but I have a feeling its not going to go my way. thanks for listening to my whinning I just can't stand the rollercoaster ride right now I just want to start down that long road ahead of me and I feel like I keep stepping back. oh I am so frustrated!!!!!!!!!! good luck to everyone tomorrow I will be thinking of you I may be there or not we will see.                                           Bridget ",

I want to move ahead but so scared to move ahead. As all of us we don't like to not be able to control some of these aspects in our lives, but yet we are forced to go through them. I know their is other women worse of then us and children and sometimes thats what I have to think of. My bosses son is batteling lymphoma and just return home after many treatments in NewYork. They are chinese and have family there Dad had to stay here to keep restraunt open. The mother does not speak English real well like some of the family of the dads and lots of family support there for her. I have watched a happy go lucky 16yr.old go from that to shrinking to nothing and so sick. I have been friends of the dad for 25yrs. since he opened a restraunt so I think of them as family. And I know he feels the same way about me this is such a double whammy for him due to I have been his manager for the last 2 years. His son is so sick and just makes my heart ache for them. So when I start feeling sorry for myself I try to think of my little buddy Preston and how brave he is with his battel. But on the other hand it scares the crap out of me!! I am going to have many more treatments thenhim although his area is sensitive (throatarea) and his cancer is not good!!! So I am thinking positive!!!!!!            I did have my tube out yesterday yey thats a plus!!!! and everything looks good to go. I went and got some fake boobs yesterday and they remind me of chicken cutlets but they will work!!! heheh!!! I hope everyone is doing well today and thank-you for letting me stay I feel like apart of you all and your such a great bunch!!!!                                          Bridget  ",

I went to a Kentucky Derby party and that was fun saw alot of my horse friends that I don't see all year till show season. I won $9.00 to boot. I was very sadden by the loss of the 2nd place winner. Thenwent to NH. and picked up my daughters horse to bring home for the summer. So it was a long week-end but fun. It still surprises me about not having the stamina I used to. I was in bed by 8:00 Sun. night!!!!            I am getting ready to have my first tx on Thurs. and I really hope its easier then A/C which it is suppose to be but its a new drug and I have not seen it on the boards, so that makes me a little nervous but we need to trust our drs. and I can't take decadrone so the Taxol was out for me. One good thing at least I will have a 2 week break off it I will just get the herceptin. Hopefully I won't be such a chemo brain and can tell you what I am on next time. Jen- We seem to be on or was on the same tx plan and they told me it was night and day with the Taxol verses A/C especially the nausea end of it. Like you I did not feel well for at least 10 days before I felt normal again, whatever we can call normal I just felt alot better. The new drug of chemo I am going on has the same se as the taxol family so they say. I am scared to cause I really don't want to feel bad again so soon. Oh well I don't have the choice I got to do it whether I like it or not!!! I just wish that the A/C was all I needed and I was done with it! I will let you know how its going.

Its driving me crazy to have to wait until the 21st but I know it will be here sooner than I think. My port is doing awsome hardly any pain just a little sorness in my neck and throat due too how long I had my head turned for the procedure. It itches like crazy but I don't know if its healing or the tape (which I have a allergy to) but the paper stuff does not hold well so they are trying with clear tape but it itches so we will see its bearable. I go to get my first fill for expanders next week we put it off due to my hematomin problem. I am definatley going to have him take it slow no more then 60 or less instead of the usual hundredccs. I have plenty of time for fills due to they won't put in implants until I am done rads. And my onc. has not even discussed how many of those I will be getting is that odd????? Maybe she is just waiting to talk until I can get through the 6 months of chemo I don't know. But I am going to say something next time I see her due to my job and about the time I get it. Which will be in the height of my summer season and definatley need to plan a schedule around it, I live 2hours away from treatment center and in the summer it will be longer due to traffic. And if I need to have it done 5 days a week its really going to be a pain in the butt. And I will need to figure out something. Hope everyone is having a good day its snowing here kids are home from school yey!!!!! At least they are not fighting yet!!!!!                                               Bridget",

I do not handle meds well at all they all seem to always act opposite then what they should do. Hopefully it won't be that way for chemo drugs meds etc. My bestfriend is going with me so that will help, I have to go to the p.s. first so he can tortue me for awhile then chemo. At least they are all considerate knowing the distance I have to travel. I was so bummed when I met with the onc. first time she said I could do chemo closer to home due to having associates in that hospital. Next time I see her she says I have to pick a dr. if I want to go there and change onc. WHAT!!! I don't know if I caught her in a mood or what but the first time from the second was like night and day. I felt she was slightly annoued with my questions and I did not have many!!! I really am the type that puts trust in her doctors and do what they say almost too much. All I asked was my average if I did chemo or not for reaccurance rate. I know I have a aggressive cancer but I guess I just wanted to know. Now I have to go there and have chemo if I want her to stay my onc. and she is the best in the B.C. field in my state as I have heard. She is not a warm fuzzy person but thats okay but she made me question if I want to stay with her or not. I will try one more time and get this first round of chemo through and see how it goes. Everyone else in the office are very nice and supportive. I guess she might have made me feel that she was trying to get me into another associate which I am sure is fine but I am tired of meeting and trying to establish relationships with diffrent drs. Its been tough and I feel I started at the breast center and my surgeon onc. made the appointment with her and said shes the best for your type of cancer. Even though they are in the same building they are not in partnership. So I am taking her word for it. We all have bad days so I am hoping I will see her in a diffrent light on Thurs. Do you even get to see the onc. on your first chemo treatment?                      I am stocking up on stuff I need thanks to all the great suggestions. Still having the wig problem though. They had the nerve to call me yesterday to make sure the color I chose was what I wanted. Did they not read the letter I sent?????? I am not a red head and the picture did not look red!!!! I guess they are still going to charge me the restocking charge oh well I feel better that I wrote the note. Its not fair for them to do that to anyone. No one else on the web does it so I will never order anything from them again!! And this site is suppose to be big b.c. advocates Someone named carol who started the company has a huge web page supporting b.c. great page but you know what she is doing a diservice when people are in our position and they end up charging you 60.00 more for exchange of wig. Things like that bug me!!!! okay I am rambling on thats what nerves due to us. Maybe I should do some housework lol!!! I hope all is going well with everyone and I am thinking of you and wishing everyone good chemo days!!!                                                    Bridget ",

I am sorry about the ones that are having all the side effect. Well My day is tomorrow and I am terrified. My sister is going with me and she is funny so hopefully she will keep me amused. I am scared of all these side effects due to I have migraines and meds just work reverse on me I will probably be like a ping pong ball with the decadron!! maybe it will work reverse and make me sleep lol!!! Of course I started my period today hopefully last one. But go figure. One of my coworkers and friends husband passed this week-end and she has no family persay so I stayed with her at the hospital. It was the last thing I needed to do or be watching someone pass but I couldn't leave my friend. Of course I have a sore throat cough which I probably got from hospital!!! even though I think I emptied that santizer spray. But I am sure lack of any sleep did not help. But at least helping someone else took my mind off Mon. morning until now. Wish me luck and I will let you know how things go. Thanks for all the tube support!!! Aurora your so funny!!! You make me laugh!!!! Is anyone else having any treatment tomorrow??? Well I am off to bed and drinking some water. Take care all. I will be thinking of all of you tomorrow and how brave you all are.

I am going to see my dr. on Fri if nothing is improved to have some nebulizer treatments . I am off to the store to get some musinex and hopefully some cough syrup with codeine and some depends yes thats correct DEPENDS how degrading but my cough is so bad I can't help it and its the way it goes.

I was up every 3 hrs. with major tooth pain nothing will touch it longer then 3 hrs. So I am still very weak feel exhausted and taking so much meds are making me feel ill. I will give it a few more hours and try to get some more fluids in me and if not I am afraid they will have to do something. I have never in my life had a tooth hurt so bad out of no where. hopefully the penicillin will kick in soon I have taken 2 already and will take a 3rd at about 11:00. I am having a hard time drinking eating is out of the question right now. and anything with citrus or salt kills me for fluids so water is it. I did manage to get a ensure down this morning after 2 tylenol#3 with codine which has helped some but the minute I have my head up it starts again. Good luck chris on working its so good to work it does take alot of head thinking though being a bartender and trying to deal with chemo brain and drugs right now is definatley a challenge I just laugh cause what are you going to do!!!!                                     Take Care all, Bridget",

I have literally sprayed myself with lysol and used hand sanitizer every time I turn around. But its hard when your child is sick and stay away from him, he still is kind of a mommies boy. Took him to the drs. today  and they put him on Tamiflu I think its more for me then him to get it kicked out of him. his peditracian is extremely concerned about me in this house but where do I go????? I think I had a mild case of it 3 weeks ago when they couldn't start me on chemo due to fever and I did have a cough and sore throat but it was mild. Keep your fingers all crossed that it passes me by!!! Donnalee- I am so glad your daughters coming to your last treatment of the awful A/C actually I consider myself fairly lucky I seem to get eveything the next week which is suppose to be our good week, I am hoping all that was a fluke!!!! I live in Maine not to far from you. CONGRATS on becoming a grandmother again how exciting for you and something to look forward to. How come you don't want to do Taxol everyweek??? I didn't realize we could do it everyother but I think with me having herceptin on top of it which I need everyweek maybe thats why I need to have it done weekly. Chris thanks for thinking of me . I hope your feeling well yourself. I hope everyone is doing good and eating sleeping and being SPOILED!!!!                                               Hugs- Bridget",

I am glad to hear everyone is doing okay so far on the taxol. It gives me hope that mine will be the same. I know some of the bone pain I experience is from the neulasta shot, I take claritan 3days before tx and then take tylenol3 when I need it. It can be very achey. Boy do I have a story to tell. I had a check-up with my oncsurgeon yesterday and she noticed I was very pale and kind of looking like a racoon and I said yes I have not bounced back from last tx. Lucky for me she is in the same building I get tx so they called over and yes needed fluids. It does get better I promise, I left the center at 11:15 and I live about 2hrs or less away and there was a bad accident on the highway so they had to reroute us after sitting in traffic feeling like crap for 1/12 hrs. Then I took wrong turn and ended up on turnpike that is not where I wanted to be. To make a long story short I had a beautiful country drive and went through many towns trying to figure out how to get home!!! I am way to stubburn to stop and ask for help lol. I got home at 4:30 my husband was like where have you been? LOST!! I am usually so good on directions but I think the good old chemo brain was there and I was so wiped out! All I could do was laugh about it cause it was so crazy I know how to get places. Lucky for me they prarranged for me to get hydrated down here at my hospital so I don't have to worry about driving so far again. Hopefully I want get lost getting there!!!!! I hope my 4th one of these is easier on me I am going to think good vibes cause its the last one of those yey!!! One week from today. Cause this one was by far my hardest!!! They say the 4th isn't because its the last and they see a pattern with the 3rd, but I think I won't try not to be so brave next time and call them before I said something. Thank god I had that appt. I just kept thinking it will get better but it didn't and know matter how much I tried to drink in between sleeeping it just got worse with the fluids. And not going to the batroom is a good sign something is up duh!! on my part. I feel like I could be in sleeping beauty cause thats all I have energy to do, but I have slept so much I can't sleep but my eyes say shut weird!!!. Well I will stop complaining and try to find some sunshine in the day since it is beautiful out. Take care all Bridget",

I am feeling much better from the fluids yesterday blood pressure was real low so they ran a few test to make sure kidneys were acting alright since I was not out putting you know what! All came back fine. Donna I am sorry this is hurting you so much. Tylenol 3 with codeine really helps me with the neulasta shot. I am scared to start that tx due to the fact that the side effects are bone and joint pain and with the shot on top of it I wonder if I will be able to move!! oh well gotta have it. I am already making plans at work for them not to count on me to much and I am making sure shifts are covered since its going to be a 3 month deal for me. I just don't want to put my boss or myself in a position that I can't work to my standards they already are being comprimised (sp) due to this. And I just don't see myself running around crazy for 6-8 hrs doing this!! maybe 3 get them through the rush. Fill in when need be which never seems to be a problem in the restraunt business. I hope your feeling some relief today and if not call your dr. and they can maybe prescribe you something, cause I do know how painful it is with the bones.                                     Takecare all Bridget",
