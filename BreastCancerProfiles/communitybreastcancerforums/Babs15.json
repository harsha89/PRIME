My question is ...is there anyone out there that declined all treatment after having a bilateral mastectomy with clear margins and no sentinal node involvement only to have it come back and end up stage IV?  I'm trying to assess whether my MO is thinking straight when he suggested I have my ovaries out to push me into menopause so he can give me drugs that, through reading on the net, make a lot of ladies quite ill from the side effects.  And, if I happen to be following in my mother's foot steps, wouldn't removing my ovaries open up my bones to possible cancer migration? Any thoughts on the subject would be wonderful.  My family won't have this discussion with me, they are all too sensitive and tell me not to think about it and to just concentrate on healing from the surgery. (thought I'd add that I'm BRAC1 and 2 negative, est and proges +, tumor was 2.2cm, margins 1cm clear)",

When was your hysterectomy?  How is the Aromasin going?",

Is there anyone out there that declined everything post surgery and just walked away?  Anyone who knows of anyone?  Did it make a difference for people who had the ovaries out and took the drugs?  Any help would be welcomed.  I can't seem to think any more.  I feel like my brain is stuck in neutral and refuses to get out for fear of more bad news.

I've decided to believe that the surgeon removed all the cancer in the 2 tumors that they found, cross my fingers and run like hell!   From what I'm reading about cancer is that it's an opportunistic immunity deficiency disease...so...due to that and my desire for quality of life being good (that or I'll drop off the deap end and go crazy!)...I'm choosing to say no to chemo and hormorne controlling drugs and have my second surgery for my DIEP reconstruct in the fall.  If it comes back...well I will have had fun until then, and 'then' deal with it...but I may be in the 70% that it doesn't come back...I'm willing to take my chances for sanity's sake.  I'm tired of 'healing' as this was the second major surgery this year...I found out I had breast cancer just after healing from another major surgery in January...  I've been reading the boards of the stage 4 folks...a lot of them did the chemo and hormone drugs just to 'make sure' the docs got it all and after some years afterward still had cancer spread...which in my mind would make me soooo pissed off I would scream at the wind and any poor soul who came within 2\" of me...I'm guessing it would make for a very bitter and unhappy soul.  Sound crazy???",
