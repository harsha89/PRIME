When the surgeon was performing my lumpectomy, he quickly realized that what he had initially thought was a fibroid was something else.  He sent it off for testing, found out it was a border-line phyllodes tumor and eventually had to go back in and take out an additional 2 cm surrounding the tumor site.  I made it to my two-year mark with no evidence of recurrence.  Now almost four years later, I have found something in my other breast that is hauntingly familiar.  I have an appt tomorrow with the doctor and I'm very nervous.  I've been doing research and can't find anything regarding the likelihood of recurrence in the other breast.  Does this happen often?  or has this happened to anyone??  It feels a lot bigger than the other one.  The tumor they excised initially was just about an inch and a half in diameter.  I've been doing research about having a masectomy...is this something a doctor would even consider at my age??

Is this kind of a rash decision?  I'm scared. Log in to post a reply",

Chances are it is nothing.  Chances are even higher in your favor that if it is something, you caught it early. At this point, I can't really give you any advice because saying \"don't worry about it\" is the least helpful piece of advice.  I know, I've been there. But I can say that I'm thinking about you and I hope that your doctor's office will be able to tell you something soon!  What a terrible time for him to take a vacation ?!?!
