I have a question myself.  I had a big sign in the hospital at the time of my BL MX for no NS BP's on the left.  I thought it was because of the injured, I would later find out, broken wrist on the ca side.  Do you know, nobody said Boo about no BP's or NS in future on the ca side.  In fact the blood draw at the cardiologist's office and the first blood draw at the 4 mos checkup at the Onc office were both done on the ca side and I did all of my at home BP's on the left ca side.  My best veins are on the left so I have always just offered that arm.  It was probably at least 8 mos later that I read about it somewhere.  Knock on wood, I do not have lymphedema.  Just how likely is it to cause problems or lymphedema?  If the insurance approves I should be having a surgery coming up to remove the The Mutants (dog ears) in the center of my chest.  The left ca side has so few symptoms in comparison to the proph side which has alot of nerve damage that my internal barometer would want to protect the proph side even though there were no lymph nodes removed on that side.  Still, now that I know, I have stopped offering the left for blood draws and am only doing BP's on the right. So don't worry, I will be cautious and not stupid about it.  Just wondering what the percentages might look like on this issue.

I am happy with my decision and with 20/20 hindsight would still do the same thing.  Be advised that the current professional 'group think' on the subject is that there are way too many MX and especially contralateral prophylactic MX. So I am not surprised at all that you are receiving pushback.  Only you can decide what is right for you and how you rank all the factors.  Under WHRCA law, it is my understanding you can get the prophylactic side as surgery for symmetry and that if your insurance covers mastectomy they would have to cover the other side. One of those things you should be able to get if you demand and push hard enough.  Doesn't mean the insurance will roll over and play dead on the first go-round.  I am NOT an attorney, but many of us have gotten it.  You need to be totally certain in your own mind and heart of your decisions and then not waiver for a second and stick to your guns when telling the doctors what you want.  I wish you all the best no matter how you decide to proceed.",

My insecurity centered around the flat chest and short hair contrasted with the other feminine details might make people wonder if I was a man who cross-dressed, was in drag, or that I might be in some stage of transgendering. Still while I wear make-up it is so minimal, it would never begin to camouflage a masculine face, and my dress has way too many feminine details to be going from woman to man.  Whatever insecurities I might have, people have just never seen me as anything but a girl.  Tomboy yes, fiercely independent in a not so feminine way, and yet 100% girl. Perhaps the decades of living with the hideously huge \"girls\" and the fight to not be objectified made me intensely uncomfortable with the \"sex\" side and yet always totally embracing the \"gender\" side if that makes any sense whatsoever.

Just like a clothes shopping trip, I am not commiting to anything, just trying on my options.  We've all been there, doesn't work and back on the rack, looked good in the store but after getting it home never quite wore it as much as expected, or get it home and it becomes a tried and true go to favorite.  I have this sneaking suspicion that when it comes to breast forms, it might end up being the middle one.  Try it a time or two and it ends up collecting dust on the shelf.  The one I liked for 10 minutes in a fitting room might become a whole other thing when worn all day especially when sitting on top of all the nerve damage.  Another big reason to not drop a bunch of money into something and have it go to waste. I love to shop, love to try new things, and it is in my nature to want to look at things from every possible angle. The good part for me is I am happy flat so if it doesn't work out, other than a bit of dust on the shelf, no loss.  That ABC First Form you like might be worth looking into as a much less expensive way to try on the concept of forms.  Barbara (ever notice how many Barbara's there are?)",

It was okay for a man to love my long legs or something else, but never was comfortable with and never appreciated them paying too much attention to the breasts.  I too feel I am now living in a perfect world though I am actually more likely now to always have the gender clues even with a little more androgynous look.  The internal conversation has on occasion asked if I might be perceived as a transgender in transition.   I would think that if someone asked themselves that question, would they then ask if that was the case, why the earrings, the makeup, and nothing in the behavior or look that is clearly masculine. Like you I have never been mistaken for a man and seriously doubt I ever will be.  Did ask a couple of men I know if the flat chest ever made them think I looked like a man.  They said No Way!! and burst out laughing.  While I sometimes like androgynous looks, I am underneath it all 100% girl, and have never wanted to be anything else. As women we are given so much more latitude than men.  If you think about it, sometimes that pushing the boundary is actually incredibly feminine. Think about the little girl who prances out in her Daddy's t-shirt or a young woman wearing her underwear and her boyfriend's shirt.  They just look incredibly feminine.  Interesting topic. Barbara",

As I wore the Genie more I realized that the pocket goes clear through and if you are really active there is a tendency for the forms to shift to the center. I found a very easy fix.  There is a triangle of reinforcement in the center.  I counted down approx 7 lines from the top and tacked down the very end of each end of the line with a single 1/8\" stitch gone over maybe 3 times in the same place and tied off.  Same thing, counted up approx 7 lines from the bottom and placed a tack stitch at each end of the line.  I wear a 36\" bra and this put the \"girls\" at the perfect width on my chest.  For a person with different proportions, you could just move the tack stitch in or out to suit your frame and form size. BTW, don't try to be clever and use a sewing machine.  4 simple tack stitches with a needle and thread are all you need. Barbara",

What did make me crazy were those damn dog ears in the center of my chest - unaffectionately called The Mutants.  Why those things got to my psyche in such a big way I cannot explain.  Stupid and utterly trivial I know but when I looked in the mirror it felt as if that part of my chest did not even look human, totally alien and no part of me.  No human being and not even any animal I could think of had anything remotely like them in the center of their chest.  I felt it looked like I had horns or a parasitic twin growing out of my chest.  Of all the things to cry over on this journey, it was those.  Goes back to what I have said often, things that are missing are not nearly as disturbing as things that shouldn't be there.  An eye sewn shut is far less disturbing than an eye in your chin.  It was never the scars I felt the need to hide, it was The Mutants.   Even myself looking at these words now, I have to think good gosh girl surely you are kidding or certifiable but it really did bother me that much.  When the OCD gene kicks in and the tape starts looping in my brain, it is hard to stop.  Forced myself to wait the year the BS said would be optimal before taking on any more surgery, and tried really hard to push it out of mind forever but never could. I finally caved and had them removed. Best decision ever. Now that they are gone, I simply have a chest with scars.  Granted more the chest of a teenage boy than anything feminine but at least human and for all its imperfections or wear and tear, totally mine. You know the odd thing at least for me is that as much as I obsessed about them on my own chest, I would never and have not viewed them the same on someone else's. But then mine were bigger, different, worse... yada yada yada.  I guess that just speaks to how self-critical we are in a way no one else would ever be.  You may now call the guys in the white coats. I was raised in a family where \"the kids\" were expected to do and to help with whatever needed to be done.  Gender never played a role.  Raising competent self-reliant kids did.  Explains why my brother can cook and run the sewing machine and I can change a tire in record time.  Never made my brother less masculine or me less feminine.  Does mean I see myself a little bit like Ellie Mae from Beverly Hillbillies.  Utterly feminine even when climbing a tree.

Ok, here's how I did it.  Go to a public photo (must be public for everone to see it) on FB. Pull up the photo, right click, choose Properties, highlight the url thru the .jpg.  You may have to scan down as the complete url may be longer than you initially see. Ctrl C to copy. Note the dimensions, this pic of mine was 445 x 442.  Then go to your post here, click on the green tree (insert/edit image) icon above, Ctrl V to paste the url into the top line.  The next line says what it is.  Put the two numbers in the size boxes and click Insert.  If you did it right you will see your image. Now as to this image.  It was taken last Christmas (2010).  No foobs and in fact was strapped down to crush the The Mutant dog ears in the center.  The belt I am wearing is what is creating the poof and any illusion whatsoever of a chest. Crystal, I think you are right that a lot of this is about attitude.  Not sure what I was doing in this photo but normally I stand up straight.  My goal is to look friendly and approachable to people - not as if I have girls.  So I try to stand up straight, walk with confidence, and maybe most important smile - even add a Good Morning.  I think it makes me seem friendly and likeable.  Besides it forces their focus away from anything that might be missing on my chest and onto my face.  Perhaps it is wishful thinking on my part but when I look at this photo my eye goes to my face. OK I do admonish myself to remember my posture.  As critical as I might be of my own appearance, I still do NOT say to myself, OMG I'm flat and I have no boobs!!  This was the \"old\" me, the day before the BMX.  As big as I look, you don't begin to see how bad it really was because they were essentially strapped down and I had girls everywhere in amounts and places you couldn't see. No matter what any of you might think - I am wayyyyyyy happier being Flat & Fabulous!!!!  Not to say that I would have ever willingly wanted BC to get there. NEVER NEVER NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!! Just that when faced with all of the risks, pain, and expense of multiple surgeries to have foobs, or get her done and go flat - flat looked really good and has proved to be the right decision for me.   Barbara",

The fitter in a different shop that I spoke to at the time of buying a post surgical cami for the BMX, was pushing the stick on foobs. Nearly ran screaming out of the shop at the very thought.  Same shop that told me I would have to have pretty big cahunas to walk around flat.  They were just wrong on all counts!!! Recently I have had moments that it might be nice to have a pair of foobs just because. Not sure if I would actually wear them or not and not sure how if I would be able to overcome the embarrassment or self-consciousness of wearing foobs one day and not the next.  Truly cannot imagine wearing them everyday.  In case you are wondering if I am turning to the \"dark side\" LOL  There are life decisions and fashion ones.  The no recon was a life decision - I can absolutely guarantee that one will not be changing.  Foobs on the other hand, are a fashion decision, subject to whim and the seasons.  What has changed is that now that The Mutant dog ears have been removed, it has only now become an option.  I am allowing myself to explore all of my options. On the day I did have a fitting before The Mutant removal, I didn't even step out of the fitting room.  Just sharing first knee jerk reactions.  Didn't even try on the microbead and foam forms as didn't feel at all like natural breasts and seemed wayyyy too perky for a 60+ chest. Also didn't like the feel of the layered one with silicone in the front and microbeads next to the chest.  The one that looked good and felt okay was an ABC 1022 asymmetrical lightweight silicone in an Amoena Greta 2124 bra. Not sure I liked or needed the front and back closures but did need the higher sides in order to smoothly accomodate the underarm fluffy stuff.  My other issue with some of the other bras I tried was they cut or pressured along the side from the strap to under the arm which is right on top of the very worst of the nerve damage.  Couldn't get them off fast enough. I have a very high deductible so if I were to buy foobs, they are going to be totally out of pocket. $900 for a set of foobs and a couple bras seems like a bit much in my world. Noticed that the local stores want $150 more EACH for the above forms over an outfit called MetroMedical online.  Barbara or anyone have experience with this company?  Just wanted to say you are not alone with the whole fitter thing.  Barbara",

I am seeing the Genie bras at Walgreens, BB & B, Target and in the last few days saw an XS at Walmart.  With the pocket already built in and the super stretchy material it might be a possibility.  At Target and Walmart you can try them on right in the store.  The Ahh is also a possibility but doesn't have the built-in pockets. My go to sports bras after surgery to protect a sensitive chest and to strap down The Mutant center dog ears before I had them removed, was a Bally Total Fitness from Sams Club. I used the same bra to hold my silicone pad and compression bandaging in place after The Mutant removal. In fact, in order to take a break from the Ace bandaging, I would use it alone with the silicone pad for a few hours a day as it did provide some level of compression. It is totally flat and one piece from side seam to side seam.  When I first tried the size 3's in an XL, I made my own cover and just placed them in the bra.  In spite of no pocket or anything else to hold them in place, remarkably they did not move an iota no matter how much I raised my arms in the air, swung them around or touched my toes, and the top band hugs the chest so no gapping.  They are double fabric so you might even be able to improvise a pocket.  They come 3 to a package of assorted colors for under $12 and are an ultra soft stretchy cotton t-shirt type material.  They sort of have a bandini kind of look with spaghetti straps.   For me they held everything in place so well that they was nearly no weight being put on the straps. For anyone else reading this a size 3 form was the largest that you could put in an XL.  Not reasonable for my size 4's. Barbara",

I work for a law firm and have gone flat from Day 1 after the BMX which was early May, 2010.  It has never been an issue and I have some very fitted clothes.  I own my look and am comfortable in my own skin.  I did have a fitting for foobs prior to the dog ear removal and must say they looked wonderful.  It was really nice to see how I might have looked if I had ever been a more normal size.  I am very broad shouldered and so chose a small C - large B (sz 6) to balance as anything smaller seemed out of place.  Maybe I will some day get a pair, maybe for only special occasions or outfits, maybe I get them and they end up collecting dust in the box on the shelf, or maybe I don't even bother at all. I must share with you that I have a wonderful PS that came highly recommended.  Though not a word has ever been said, I get that feeling that he thinks that just removing The Mutants (dog ears) and leaving me with the flat chest of a young thin teenage boy was a waste of his artistic talent.  Even if it was in fact a waste to him, it was of enormous value to me.  The fitter told me she had a number of her clients tell her that when they decided against getting nipples to avoid further surgeries, that their PS said \"What, I did all this work and now you are not going to finish the job?\"  I had an adjustment period in the beginning when I wore big shirts and cardigans to hide it.  I slowly moved to more and more fitted clothes and embraced my new look.  Even if someone notices I am flat, I have no reason to think they are at all disturbed by it.  I look at my photos on the previous page and I know if I passed myself on the street I wouldn't give it a second thought.  Likely the only reason I would zero in on the flat chest is because I'm flat and wonder if I am the only one out there.  I think of myself as 60+ flat & fabulous. Christy, I pray the rest of your journey is far more drama free and you are definitely Fabulous!! OK all, I want to see more pics please.  Barbe, surely you have some to share. Barbara",

First, my advice is to embrace \"recon\".  Before you lose your mind and try to strangle me, take a deep breath and look at this link. http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/cagwhcra.pdf Google WHCRA for even more links and info.  I was left with dog ears in the dead center of my chest which meant that I had to essentially compression wrap them every day of my life in order to keep them from showing through my clothes. They were too close together to allow for the wearing of anything with a center seam and so I had no option but to go flat until they were surgically removed.  I had nerve issues that were being exacerbated by the strapping down every day so I had that additional element.  I have found many doctors think dog ears, or anything else left, are no big deal and that if you are not going to \"recon\" as most think of it, then why bother.  After you read the link, you come to realize that you are entitled to all stages of recon on the same basis as the insurance's coverage of mastectomy.  Also many states have additional laws in this regard.  Let's face it, insurance is always looking for a way out.  So again, I say to you embrace \"recon\" and lose \"revision\" in your conversation. I am NOT an attorney and do not even play one on TV.   Still my understanding is you are entitled to every stage of recon.  Thing is you and I only want/wanted one stage.  It's a semantics issue.  Recon related to mastectomy due to BC, they have to cover, scar revision maybe/probably not.  My Mutant removal was submitted, approved, and paid by insurance as \"recon\", even though I now (Thank you God!!!) have the nice flat chest of a 10 year old boy, instead of looking like I had horns growing out of my chest. Concentrate more on the fact this scar is causing pain.  Don't forget a part/stage of what is done in the whole traditional recon process is cleanup.  You come to realize that many PS think it is a waste of their artistic talent to just clean up the original MX site and leave you with the smooth chest of a young boy so yes you will likely have to work harder to get a sympathetic ear.  Also if you are turned down the first time, appeal, quote the statutes, go after them.  Threaten to call your state and/or fed reps if need be.  There are no guarantees in this game, but if I was in your position, I would not be going down without a fight and one that is going to embarass the heck out of the insurance company if they refuse to relent.  Mine actually went far smoother than I anticipated but I was fully prepared to go to my state reps and make it a public issue if need be.   Wishing you all the best in having this resolved.

I figure I have months to have the surgery and completely heal before I have to make any decisions.   And even then could get them and they end up in the box on shelf.  Who knows? Barbara",

No doubt I am not nearly as broad shouldered as you but even so if I was totally anorexic (take off another 20 lbs from the photo) with my flat chest, I would never be less than a size 10 in tops.  Proportionately, that would probably equal a size 4 or less in pants.  I am not complaining.  While I am a manufacturer's disaster area, my disproportionate parts have served me well.  The broad shoulders helped offset the enormous pre-BMX chest and now to balance the top to the hips.  I have a 5' 4\" body on 5' 8\" legs and I have always considered my long slender legs as one of my greatest assets.  Now they are one of my favorites when redirecting attention elsewhere.

Dog ears to varying degrees are very common in breast surgery, tummy tucks, and certain facial sutures. My center dog ears were also so close together that you could not set anything with a center seam on my chest never mind the irritation.  Any thought of prosthetics was out of the question until they were removed.  With clothes it looked as if I had a pair of horns coming out of my breastbone or perhaps a parasitic twin growing out of my chest.  The only thing I could do was strap them down every day. I have said before - Things that are missing are not nearly so disturbing as things that shouldn't be there.  I feel so FREE now. Barbara",

My strategy is to send the eye and focus onto anything but the missing girls.  The big concave areas create a focal point that emphasizes the missing which is what makes them so bad. While it is nice and a really big plus, it is not necessary to create the illusion of breasts.  I have worn a tshirt with the name of our local football team in big letters right across my chest.  The focus is on the logo and not what is missing underneath. For me, big wide belts (I like the stretch ones) give an illusion of an hourglass figure and give a little extra fullness to some of my tops which sometimes can give the illusion that I really do have girls. Just think focal points.  Send the eye where you want it to go.  Jewelry, belts, designs, unusual details - doesn't matter what it is.  And remember no matter what you are wearing, you can always look them straight in the eye, smile and say Hi - forces them to raise their eyes to your face.

However, my hair has always been thin since infancy and the hair on my arms and legs was always pretty fine and light in color. My BS was adamant about wearing the binders and then the dog ear mutants forced me to wear sports bras to strap them down so I have been bound for all but the last month when I decided that it caused me too much discomfort to continue.  In case, anyone thinks it might have meaning, I had a broken arm at the time of BL MX on the ca (left) side which of course had a very big effect on how much I used each arm. Though with the huge hematoma on the right and inability to put my right arm down for a very long time, I was really restricted on both sides.  The broken bone took 6 mos total to heal, partially because I didn't know it was broken in the beginning and so didn't have a cast, and partially because this particular bone takes 4-6 mos to heal.",

Momine, I think you are right, the doctors likely find it embarrassing.   Truth be told, I may likely have been embarrassed as well. [Deleted as off-topic] Barbara",

Almost ironic that for most, they wonder how people will react if they go flat. I have gone flat for so long and have everyone so \"trained\", that I wonder how people would react if I suddenly out of the blue decided to have a \"bring the girls to work day\", that is if I had any to bring.  I actually think it is hysterical that I am so confident flat and would be almost afraid to show up with girls. Not to say that I am seriously thinking about getting \"girls\" but I really am curious about the experience of women who sometimes wear girls in public and sometimes they don't.  I would almost think that to go back and forth would be the most difficult of all or do you find that it is no more unusual or a big deal than showing up with a new haircut or color?
