      "Content": "Feb 24, 2017 11:13PM - edited Feb 25, 2017 07:24AM by lidabit hey all, My surgery is scheduled March 3. I just finished chemo February 1 and I am getting nervous about the surgery. My doctor is leaving it up to me to decide UMX vs BMX and I am all over the place about the decision. I will also get sprightly SNB. Technically my long term survival is the same either way, but having just gone through all of this, I don't ever want to go through it again. On the other hand, I really don't want to make the decision based on fear and would really prefer to keep 1 breast if I can. I have to get a MX because I have 2 areas of concern on my right breast. I am doing delayed reconstruction and I am heavily leaning towards A DIEP. I just don't like the idea of implants. I have always been a barely A cup. My PS recommended delayed reconstruction because I might have to have radiation depending on my margins and my lymph node status. I will get TE because my breasts are so small. Part of me is considering just going flat. I don't know. Too many decisions. Mostly I am feeling overwhelmed and anxious. I wish I could just be done with all of this.",

I ended up getting a unilateral MX, axillary LND, and a tissue expander placement under the muscle with 150 ccs on the right side. The pain has been mostly manageable - less than a 2. I had quite a bit of energy after the surgery. My sister was visiting to take care of me and I even got a chance to go to the beach - which is about an hour away. Honestly, the hardest part of the recovery, for me has been the emotional part. Under my arm is numb - kinda. It almost constanantly feels like it is coming out of being numb, - not the pins and needles feeling, but the burning feeling you get after that. Nipple/skin sparing was not an option for me with the placement of my tumor. My whole chest is numb. When I look in the mirror and touch the skin I feel a little nauseated, like my brain can't reconcile what is happening because it sees it is being touched, but can't feel it. I also hate the tissue expander. It feels heavy on my chest. Part of me wishes I had just gone flat. It does not help that every time I see my PS he tries to convince me to put in implants, although I plan to get an eventual DIEP. I was very small before all of this and I am happy to stay small after. He keeps talking about how it is a free boob job. I couldn't care less about getting a boob job. I liked my boobs just the way they were. Stupid. I had one drain post op and getting it out wasn't too bad. I took a pain pill before and it was pretty easy. It took 10 days. I have to wear a compression bra for 3 weeks which I find incredibly uncomfortable. I rarely wore a bra prior to this so I have one more week and I can't wait! . My PS also said no arm exercises for 3 weeks. Is this normal? I find that I am told almost 2 different things from my general surgeon and my PS. SO FRUSTRATING. I met with The nurse about a week after the surgery and she said I am at a 20% risk of developing lymphadema so I should wear the sleeve as a preventative for the first 3 months. It only aggravates the feeling I have in the inside of my arm. I got my pathology back. Good and bad news. Both areas have shrunk quite significantly to 9 and 7 mm with only scant cancer cells left! But they both showed IDC not IDC and DCIS like the original biopsy said. 0/9 lymph nodes were negative! All the margins were clear! But the deep margin was less than 1 mm so I am on the borderline for radiation. My Rad Onc is going to present me at tumor board, but is pretty convinced the vote will be 60/40. I know that radiation is not that bad compared to chemo, but I was looking forward to being done. Any feedback from those who have gone through it would be appreciated. Also does anyone have a hard recommendation for how long you are supposed to sleep on your back ata 45 degree angle? I can't remember and I miss sleeping on my side. I am sending out lots of positive thoughts and healing both physically and emotionally to everyone on the board. We will get through this. Thank you for all of your posts. They have been really helpful and I am sorry I haven't been able to be as supportive as I would have liked. Okay my rant is over.",
