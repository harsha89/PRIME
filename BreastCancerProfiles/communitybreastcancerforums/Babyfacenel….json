The kind of sports bras that you pull over your head will be hard to get on and off the first few days after surgery.  Because of where my incision is, the front-closing sports bras that have plastic clips instead of zippers ended up rubbing against the incision.  I am back to wearing normal bras again (surgery was exactly a month ago), but I still wear the sports bra when exercising or working in the yard.  Probably always will--I like them now! As for the rest, I will second what almost everyone else is saying:  Surgery is a breeze, recovery is not bad at all (I took pain pills the first night and next day only), and the incisions will look bad right after and look much better in only a few weeks. You'll be fine.",
