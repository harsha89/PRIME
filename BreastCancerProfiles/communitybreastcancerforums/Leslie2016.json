I get a twinge from my underarm now and then, but I figure that's mostly from stuff chaffing on the incision. Back of arm is still a little novacainy but I only notice when I touch it. Basically I'm over the surgery, and trying to get a handle on the chemo I started this week. Scared of doing the genetic testing next week and having them say I need to do a DM. Really don't want to. Not because I'm afraid of losing them, but just don't want to go through the surgery and recovery. I also guess they would do it sooner rather than later and stop my chemo? I don't know. One step at a time. Onward....",

Side effects: I felt fine the day of my treatment and more or less the day after. I think days 3 & 4 were the worse for me, but even they weren't bad. Hoping that stands true for all treatments, but I know that's probably too much to hope for. I'm sure I'll have my ugly days. I think being proactive is the big thing...if I even thought I might be getting nauseous I ate something and took a gravol. One of the nurses explained to me that a lot of the time when people are feeling nauseous it's because they are actually hungry...but they don't eat because they are afraid of being sick, but not eating makes it worse, etc. So gravol at the first sign of nausea, I took senoknot the first day I didn't go to the washroom regularly, I took tylenol as soon as I felt a headache or body ache starting. I honestly can't say that I had any major side effects (other than the bone pain at the top of my spine a couple of nights after my neulasta shot) because I treated everything before they were able to take hold. Also, I'm very glad I accepted the hydration for the 3 days after my treatment (a nurse came to my home and put me on a saline drip of 1L over 4 hours each day) because I know on the 3rd day, it really perked me up after it was finished. The only side effect I didn't deal with proactively was the waking up for 3 days at 2:30 am and not being able to get back to sleep because of the steroids. I will talk to my team before the next round and have something in place for that this time.",

I could feel myself perk up when it was done on my worse day. Coupon, I am on the same treatment you are. I didn't get to do the pre-chemo workshop until the afternoon after my first treatment, but I did it. Yes, it's worth it. Even though I had just finished the treatment, it solidified a few answers for me.Things like, don't wait until the side effect gets really bad before treating it, be proactive. Didn't go to the washroom today? Take senokot before bed THAT DAY. Don't wait until you haven't gone for 2-3 days, then you are in for a world of hurt. My mother who has gone through this said constipation is the worse part, to the point of agony...and there is no use to letting it get that far. If I woke in the night and even thought I might be nauseous, I took precautions. An extra gravol on top of my other meds wasn't going to hurt anything, and there was no reason to suffer. I know all this is scary, but forwarned is a good thing. If you have the knowledge, you can use it. Shadowcat, I know it feels like it's happening to someone else.It's ok. Keep moving forward and you will get through this. The neulasta caused me some pain, but again, I grabbed the heating pad, took some tylenol and went to bed. It was much better in the morning. You can do this ladies. As you said, we are warriors, and we will make it through.",

So I asked her well, as stupid as this sounds, is there something I should do to raise my BP, so it doesn't get that low again? (like anyone ever wants to raise it! lol) She said sometimes when your BP gets really low, it's because you don't have any natural salts left...that people really pump the water before chemo, so it cleans out all the salts and lowers it. So she said yes drink water, but also drink gingerale and teas to get some salts back in. So I got permission to drink pop! LOL Made me smile! ;)",

Had a few giggles as some staff walked right by me not clicking it was me then backtracked. ;) I'm almost jealous that you go back this week! I'm on a 3 week schedule, not 2. This 3 week schedule seems like it's going to take forever to get through! I do go back Wednesday though to do blood work for my port placement, which is next Monday. Good luck Wednesday!! May your side effects be no worse than they were the first time!!",

They don't seem pleased that it's high and I don't have a fever. I know, fevers and chemo are a bad thing, but my friend who is a nurse told me there are people that can have an infection and not present with a fever...they don't \"like\" those people because it makes it harder to diagnose them when a fever is the best/first sign that an infection is present. If I'm one of those people it's harder to tell when I \"need help\". The infection will get further before I have symptoms. Oh joy. Kinda hoping that's not the case.

Not in a I don't think I need it/want it way, but wanting to understand better why I'm getting the drugs I'm going to get and why 3 FEC's...why not 4, or 5 or 6? Why 3 D's? I just don't understand how they decide on what, and of course now that my brain thought about all these questions, I can't get them out of my head. I got a call to go in for a CT scan on Monday afternoon; I may call my MO nurse and see if she has 10 min to talk to me while I'm there just to sort out my brain. Ok, the hair thing. I went yesterday and bought a couple of wraps, just so I have something here. They are giving me a prescription on Wednesday to get a wig, I think my insurance covers it. I'm sick of calling them about things already!! I've signed up for a Look good feel good or whatever it's called but it's not until the end of November so I may have to look up some of those videos so I can look half human. My daughter is in a musical a few weeks after my first treatment and I'm going darn it...and I don't want her to be horrified having me there bald and stuff as it will be so new. Onward...",

I have a question for you all, or maybe if someone is reading that's done chemo already, they will answer. Do you all plan on having someone (friend, family) sit with you every treatment? Just the first one? Maybe it's because I've had so much thrown at me so quickly and haven't had a lot of process time, but I'm actually dreading having my mom or sister with me at my first chemo. I feel like I haven't had time to actually be with me, and there are questions I want to ask without them hearing the answers, if that makes sense. I think I'm feeling a little smothered. I don't mean it to sound so awful, I love them both and am very thankful my sister was with me Wed/Thurs when I got all the news, but dang it, there's a large part of me that wants to play 20 questions with the nurses on Wednesday (1st chemo) and then just read or veg.

It takes 4-6 hours...I CAN go out while it's happening, but I can't plan anything when I don't know when they are coming. There's a phone call as soon as I'm up and moving. Nothing major so far though. Hope it continues like this. ",

I go for my first neulasta shot at 3:30. After this one, I can do them myself. Nurse will be here after lunch to put me on a saline drip for 4-6 hours, but I'm mobile with it and she will just come back when it's done. It's as needed so I have this for the 3 days after each treatment if I want. I figured if it will help keep the nausea and other side effects away, why not?

Check it out; there may be someone available for you to talk to. Also, I'm 99% sure they change the dose dependent on your weight. They weighed me the day I found out I was HER2 positive and needed chemo and met my MO. They weighed me the next day when I went back to see the RO. They weighed me when I went for my first treatment and then went and mixed the dose based on my weight that day. I have a feeling I'm going to be weighed more in the next year than I have been for the past 5 combined. Talk to your MO about how you are feeling. It may or may not be a good idea to delay the chemo. You really need to talk to them about all of this,and sort out what is best for you and your case. We are here to listen though!

My daughter is also a graduating student from the school this year, so it's going to be very emotional for me, as I've known quite a few of the grade 12's since they were 4 years old. My hope is by my being there they will know that all the research that they help raise money for IS making a difference. I will be a survivor because of that research and my hope is with further research it will be even easier to get to the other side in years to come. ",

I know me, and I know within a week I'll be saying screw it, not caring if others look at me funny. I can do this. People keep reminding me that I'm the strongest person they know in a lot of ways. I umpire men's baseball. I'm only 5' 1\", and I've stood toe to toe with guys twice my size without flinching. My job involves helping people that have problems bigger than they should have to handle. What's a little hair? So, I'm going to find the positives each day, and hold on to those positives. Since I mentioned my umpiring, I'll start with a positive there. I've been an umpire about 22 years. I umpired all summer, stopping after the first week of playoffs because of my diagnosis. Heck, I umpired 4 games the night I was diagnosed! After so many years of proving myself, having others make comments that I couldn't umpire high level ball because a woman couldn't keep up with the men and proving them all wrong, of just wanting to be seen as an umpire, not a female umpire...my crew of guys rock. They haven't had their end of season party yet. They told the boss that they would delay and make it an end of season/Christmas party, and that I must be there. This wonderful group of guys, many of which I've trained over the years are picking me up and holding me tight through this. How can I not succeed with a bunch of men crazy enough to be yelled at for fun each week behind me? Today when my hair goes, I will will just remind myself that with or without hair, I can rock with the best of them. Right? Remind me later, when the tears come.",

Well, I have to deal with the X as far as getting him to get my daughter around town while I can't, but I'm trying to let them do it themselves as much as possible and keep me out of the middle.  ",

Ok, not going back for all the names (sorry) but welcome to our new people!! Someone asked about: Hair - I like Nfullblume am on day 11. I was told that within 10-14 days all my hair would fall out, so me being me and being proactive I shaved it all off on day 5. That said, my stubble is still there, so it hasn't all happened yet. I did notice some thinning even before I shaved it, which made me nervous I wasn't even going to get to day 5, so there ya go. I do think my nose hairs and possibly my \"moustache\" and legs are a little thinner, but that may be my imagination. What do do before chemo - I was told just to make sure I hydrated the day or two before. The more hydration the better for the couple of days before and 3-4 after. Other than that, no prep required, just take a book or music or something with you for something to do. I now carry a water bottle with me everywhere. Well, I kind of did before but now I double check I have it. I just got up the morning of my first chemo and took all the meds they gave me for nausea at the required time. Window from surgery to chemo - from my reading around this site and others I've seen it say just a few weeks to heal up from the surgery, then chemo can start. My surgery was Oct 7 and I started Chemo Nov 2. Hope that helps!",

I took all 3 the morning of my first chemo, one of them 12 hours later, then 2 of them in the mornings for 2 days after my treatment. I was told to take gravol \"as needed\" and not to be stupid...if you feel like you are starting to get nauseous, take it right away, do NOT wait until it was bad. Also, one of the people I spoke to (I spoke to so many in a short period of time, so I can't remember if it was my nurse navigator, the dietitian or who) also said a lot of the time when you start to feel nauseous it's actually because your body wants food...but people think, ack! I'm nauseous! so they don't eat, which actually makes it worse, then you can't eat...etc. Vicious cycle. So, even if it's a couple of crackers, put something in your stomach first thing in the morning. It may help. I did take gravol twice...but it was more because I wasn't sure if I was becoming nauseous or not, so I took it as a precaution. The nausea meds they give you these days are amazing compared to what I remember family members going through.",

The reason is I have 6 chemos plus 18 Herceptin treatments (well, 3 of the herceptins will be with my last 3 chemos) so they deemed it too many infusions to do veins every time. I'm choosing not to worry about the lump. Ultrasound was done yesterday...I figure if it was something major that we needed to deal with immediately they would have called me today.

The D is taken 3 tablets before chemo, then 2 tablets the next two days. So far, the combo of the 3 has kept my nausea totally at bay. Now, this Wednesday is my last of the FEC and that is all the nausea meds I have, so I don't know if I will take all of these while on the D (different than the above D...lol) portion of my chemo. BG, I told the dietitian that I made yogurt with granola and fruit in it each morning for breakfast (yeah, ok, I did when I was going/taking it to work...not so much now that I'm sitting home) She suggested I also cut a prune up into it...the other fruit will mask the prune taste since I'm not a prune fan. Can you hide prunes or something in something else? DianaRose, I was told to use a moisturising conditioner and massage it in...I also find letting my head \"airdry\" rather than throwing a scarf/hat on immediately is keeping the itching and soreness down. Don't know what to tell you about the sleep...I just limit my naps to 20 min tops unless I\"m really feeling crappy. My question is, if this chemo is suppose to throw me into menopause, how many treatments does that take? My \"friend\" came to visit this week, and I'm not impressed.",
