Because of this condition, her doctor could not remove it. The tumor looks like a volcano. A wound opens on the top of the tumor and keeps on bleeding everyday. Sometimes, mom has heavy bleeding, then she has to use diapers. We have tried different methods to control the bleeding. But the wound is expanding. Her doctor does not propose any solution to this problem. Mom is on HT (anastrozole tablet). Some friends suggest that radiation treatment might help to reduce the size of the wound. But we have so little informaiton here to make sense of the side affects of this option. Also, I hope to find out other options. If you know how to cope with this sitution, please please please contact me. Thank you very much! Ying from Shanghai   Dx 8/2011, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IV, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I do not know the names of the medicine that she got. I will ask her. We spoke to three doctors. Two of them said that chemo is too late for this stage. I do not know what to do. Plus, mom herself opposes the chemo approach. We checked her blood last week. She is anemic. I will tell her to get some iron supplement. ",

My mom's condition is very similar to the description of fungating tumor. We were told by mom's doctor that her tumor is the recurrence of bresat cancer that she had 23 years ago. Because it is big...(>8cm) and it is fixed on the bone, the doctor said that they could not use the surgical method to remove it. But, I do not know what this information implies...  I will ask the doctor if the hospital can give us any fibrillar. But I do not know how to call it in Chinese. What does it look like? ",

I know she took Tamoxifen for three years. And it stopped working anymore, and the new tumor started to grow. Now, she only takes anastrozole tablets, one per day. Plus, she takes some herbal medicine soup. But, there is little improvement. And the wound is expanding. I will find a way to make aloe vera dressings. I heard that honey dressings can promot wound healing. Have you ever used such dressing before? ",

He thinks the HT is still working, and mom should stick to it. At the same time, becuase of blood loss, mom has been very weak. I do not feel that I could 'push' her to take the 'harsh' chemo treatment. When she feels stronger, I will ask her if she can try the chemo or go to see a different doctor. Now, the bleeding situation is controlled by the medicine. The tumor still bleeds a little. Mom changes one dressing per day. But, the wound on the tumor is expanding, more fresh is exposed. I am looking for dressings that can promote the healing of the wound. ",

Then, she needs a diaper or several gauze-cotton patches. The hospital does not take my mom just for this on-and-off bleeding problem. The local resource is limited. As well, information related to breast cancer is not widely avaiable. I have not found any information related to my mom's case  on Chinese health websites.  I hope I will get some advice through this network.  Now, my mom does not have pain. She can walk, eat, sleep, and do some housework. What worries me most is that the wound is expanding as the skin on the tumor dies and the fresh gets exposed. We have consulted several doctors. They all said that it is difficult to heal the wound. I really hope to find ways to (at least) reduce the size of the wound. Ying ",
