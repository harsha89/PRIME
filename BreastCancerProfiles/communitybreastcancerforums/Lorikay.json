Has anyone been this far out of their diagnosis like myself and just now trying to make sense of it all. I want reconstruction but not a great candidate. I go back and forth so much. Is this normal?",

My days are filled with so many emotions now, and during my surgery and treatment time I was Super woman. Nothing bothered me. Just hit the road running. Now after work I just can't get motivated to do anything. One positive thing is I joined an exercise boot camp. I gained so much weight during and after all the treatments. The camp helped. But only lost about 15 lbs in 9 months. Good grief. I have a lot of healing to do emotionally, and look forward to this chat room to just answer my questions and maybe some fears.",
