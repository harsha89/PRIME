Here is my story: 51 year old, very healthy, no family history of cancer, had one child (breast-fed), normal mammogram for the last 10 years so so, no lumpy breasts, no lumps found at all, no pain, no discharge, etc. I did the screening mammo at the end of May, and was expecting normal results as usual. But got call back the next day re: several areas that the radiologist saw that I needed to do diagnostic mammo and ultra-sound. Completed both on 6/4, and they found microcalcifications on the left that are suspicious and two suspicious masses on the right that i needed to do stereotactic vacuum biopsy on the left and ultra-sound guided biopsy on the right. This came as a total surprise for me given my healthy history, no issues with past mammo, and no palpable lumps, no other issues with my breast. I did the two biopsies on Wednesday and received the \"FINAL\" pathology report yesterday. The left side shows \"ADH\". I thought ADH is good news, not cancer, but I am confused about the report. I have an appointment with my breast surgeon this coming Wed, and i would like to be better educated re: my situation before i see him. I would very much appreciate your help in providing some insights and guidance. Here is what the pathology report said: Pathology Outcome Section: High Risk Pathology Result Section: The pathology for the left breast stereotactic biopsy is benign, yielding ADH in a background of proliferative fibrocystic changes with associated microcalcifications. The pathology results are concordant with the imaging findings. Surgical consultation is advised. The pathology for the right breast at 11:00 and 11:30 o'clock is benign yielding fibroadenoma Impression: left stereotactic-guided vacuum assisted core biopsy completed. An addendum will be provided when the pathology results are available BI-RADS Path: Addendum Report will be made available when path results are available Here are my questions: 1. If i interpret it correctly, both sides are benign, which is good news. If that's the case, why is surgical consultation advised for the left side. Isn't the finding benign, not cancer, and the end of the story? 2. I am not understanding the verbiage under Impression and BI-RADS Path. It only mentioned the stereotactic biopsy completed on the left. It made no mention of the US guided biopsy on the right. Is this report incomplete? Also, why does it say addendum will be provided when the pathology results are available? Same for the BI-RADS Path section that reference addendum report will be available when path results are available? Did they not already have the path results to publish this \"FINAL\" report and ruled both sides benign? 3. From reading this thread, it looks like folks are diagnosed with ADH initially, but then it later found out to be DCIS or IDC. Isn't the needle biopsy supposed to be very accurate? Why did the needle biopsy not pick up the DCIS or IDC pathology? 4. For ADH, what treatment options/plans can I expect down the road? OR do i need treatment at all or no actions needed, just watch and monitor? Sorry for so many questions. But my mind works better with information and knowledge.",

He spent maybe no more than 5-10 mins with me letting me know that it is benign, and the left side is ADH. He said to do surgery and that will cure it. After that, it is just regular mammo in 12 months. He made no mention about high risk, or discuss options of taking tamoxifen, or more frequent screening needed, or anything like that. Is this right? Am I just over-reacting to the ADH diagnosis?",
