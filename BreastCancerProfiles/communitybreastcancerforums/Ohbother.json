She was such a strong person; just a whilwhind of activity and joy... She began to have symptoms and died within 4 months from ALS at age 41.  So, my point is, we all have a terminal illness.  We are just a little luckier in that there is lot of us which  makes for more progress and I truly believe we have lot of people working to keep us here longer.  I try to hang on that.  Like I read in another post... In talking with  my friend about my breast cancer, I never in a million years thought she would die, from a disease, before me... So, I know the black cloud is always there off in the distance... Just try to keep it that way.  Good Luck...cc ",
