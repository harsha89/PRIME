This is the second time for me, had DCIS in 1995, found a lump Oct in same breast and here I am again. Things have changed a lot but feelings have not. I am part of the Oct surgerys and that has helped, still with them but they are beyond were I am, they have helped a lot, still will stay with them but you all are were I am now. Sandra, great gal, posted some good info on what you need supply wise. She has been through 5 breast  surgerys, just look for the animated cat on the computer. Even with all the great info I still have fear and a lot of concerns. Now I am sitting on the bench with all of you waiting and appreciating the company.",

I wanted to share some info, I have been trying to figure out the best way to handle the drains without using diaper pins or spending a lot of money on camis with pockets and a friend came accrost this website you can buy Velcro pockets 3 or 4 pair can't remember for 19.00 dollars designed specificity to hold drains. Also Walmart, target, carry neck pillows that you can inflate soft to hard that fit great under your arm so I am going to try one out to see if it would work before surgery. Counting down the days with all of you. http://www.pink-pockets.com/en/survivors-guide/",

I was told this week that my surgery would not be until Jan 7th, I wanted to cry, so disappointed. I had Breast MRI and Bone scan this week, really stressed me out. It is great seeing all of you doing so well, except for the itching! twolumps I have read other posts were ladies had the same issue as you with the extra skin. From what I read that can be taken care of even if you deciede not to have reconstruction, so hang in there, sending lots of positive thoughts your way.",
