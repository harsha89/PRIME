Either way, the waiting is the worst and I believe that it\u2019s not as scary as it seems to be. I\u2019m getting biopsy results tomorrow although I already have a diagnosis. I just want to get on to the treatment part. I\u2019ve also worried about other \u2018symptoms\u2019, but try not to worry about the other pains - there are so many other non cancer related things that happen in our bodies. Please let us know how you got on. Xx",
