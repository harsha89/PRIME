When doing a self exam in the shower, I noticed that a brown discharge was expressed from that same breast and that it was quite tender.  I had my yearly pap scheduled and decided to wait the 1.5 months until that appointment, thinking that maybe after the next cycle these issues would go away. They didn't. I went for my pap and my gyn examined everything. She referred me for a mammogram, ultrasound, and bloodwork. She called two days later with my mammo results. The right breast (which was heterogenously dense and they said could obscure small masses) was showing prominent lactiferous ducts, a loose grouping of \"numerous\" microcalcifications, and a cluster of microcysts (or cystic structure...they called it both in the report) with some internal echoes. I was graded BI-RADS 4 (suspicious abnormality) and was referred to a breast specialist. That appointment is this coming Thursday. I have to pick up my films from radiology to bring to that appointment.  I'm absolutely petrified. It's not just one thing...with the discharge, the microcalcifications, the cysts, and the lactiferous ducts...I just can't imagine there NOT being anything significantly wrong in there. While they didn't mammo the left breast, there is no thickening, no discharge, etc. I do not have a history of breast cancer in my family and I'm only 28. All I can think about is my girls and what a bc diagnosis would mean for them. Log in to post a reply",

The report just talked about the grouping of numerous calcifications, the cystic structure/cluster of microcysts with internal echoes, heterogenously dense tissue, the bloody discharge, and the prominent lactiferous ducts. Coolbreeze- I keep hoping that if it is going to be a bad diagnosis, that it's either precancerous or very early stage. Even with those thoughts, my irrational mindset is that cancer=death. I know that's not necessarily the case, and more often than not it isn't the case at all, but...I can't help it! If it isn't cancer and I have all of these \"problems\" in there, anyone know what they would do? The main reason I noticed something wasn't right was this aching/tender area. It's pretty much a daily thing right now...and with the size of the cluster and whatever else in there (to me, it feels ping pong ball size-ish) and the fact that I'm so small chested to begin with (large A, small B), I have a hard time even laying on my stomach because the pressure on my chest makes it ache even more. I have no idea if it's the cluster of cysts, the prominent ducts, or what!",
