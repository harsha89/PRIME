Now, here is what you do:  you make a stink, with the hospital, with the press office, anyway you can.  There is no way that she should be forced to wait to remove that tumor.  No way.  Write letters to the hospital admin, fax them, call them.  Get the noise going.  It is a nasty fight, but I bet you will prevail.",

You need to get good nutrition to help this process--it will make a difference. But what do you do after the infection and inflammation is gone?  What are you left with? After the tissues are completely healed, you need to research microfat grafting.  There is a thread here at BCO which is all about microfat grafting.  I have not had it done, I have no experience with the doctors who do it, and I have no deep knowledge of the procedures involved.  BUT, I did read and see enough about it to know you may be able to benefit from it, also that it is a multi stage process.  There is a doctor in Florida, Dr Khouri, who has a lot of experience with it.  I think this might be able to restore your feelings of \"wholeness\".  The photos I have seen are miraculous.

What I learned is that \"true medullary\"(TMC)  is very rare.  \"Atypical medullary\" (AMC) is a little less rare.  Here is the difference:  under the Ridolfi guidelines, TMC needs to have 5 features.  If it has all 5 than your prognosis is very favorable.  In fact, if you are early stage 1, you can possibly stop treatment after surgery--no chemo, no rads.  It looks like an aggressive cell, but the tumor behaves well and doesn't tend to metasticize.  Now, if you have AMC, and have two of the features of \"synctial growth pattern\" in at least 2/3 of the tumor and a dense lymphocytic envelope and some prominent lymph infiltrate, then you have a favorable turn as well, BUT NO PATHOLOGIST OR ONC WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THIS ANYMORE, because they fear you will undertreat.  So they treat AMC, even with those premium features, like IDC.  But a large study in Denmark disagrees with this tactic.  If you have one or some of the other med features like \"pushing borders\" or a mild lymph infiltrate, then you really will not benefit from any favorable interpretation, and should def treat it as IDC. You need to find out exactly what kind of medullary features you had....which ones?  If you had a dense lymphoplasmatic response, that is significant.  Did you?",
