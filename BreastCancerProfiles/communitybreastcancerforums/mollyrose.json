An ultrasound and mammogram were done beforehand at my local women's center, the report was negative. Then I went to a breast cancer surgeon at a large hospital for the biopsy, and I gave her the cd of my screenings. One day after calling me w/ biopsy results, she called back today to say that the radiologist there had not signed off on my case before she called me. His report states that I have slightly enlarged lymph nodes (not sure if this was on the mammogram or the u.s.) He is recommending that I have a repeat of both tests. Now I am more freaked out than I was when I thought I had PD. Are they being super cautious or should I be worried? Can I take any comfort in the fact that the first radiologist did not address nodes? thanks~",
