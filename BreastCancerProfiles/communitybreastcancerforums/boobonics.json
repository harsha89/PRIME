Thanks for letting my know I am not alone in this battle. Deb Log in to post a reply",

I am having to learn all new rules.  My life as I knew it, is changing and will involve travelling.  I do pack on the bed.  When I can I will spread packing out, but sometimes its throw and go-with clean clothes.  last weekend I did not even have 48 hours at home between trips. I will wear my sleeve and glove this next weekend when I pack..  I appreciate all the tips.  Deb",
