Even though I don't want to do either one,  I am thinking I will take the strongest form to prevent the chance of reoccurance.  I don't want to go through this again! Sometimes things happen for a reason and we have to go through hell sometimes to get to heaven.   Kay- I am scared too.  I think we all are.  Its been a long time to stress over surgeries, diagnosis and now treatment.  I think the stress/anxiety has been the worst(at least I hope).  How did your port placement go? I get mine on July 2.  There is alot of great forums here and I have been reading them for several weeks now.  There are alot of great tips and suggestions.  I keep all the suggestions in a journal just in case I need them during chemo.   Gma-I also got the Brian Josephs.  Hopefully it will work.  We will have to keep in touch and swap stories.  I was also sad to see my hair go, but there are so many other things to worry about that my hair was the least of my worries.  I want to concentrate on my body and getting it healthy again.  The rest will follow.  I had long hair my entire life. and have been cutting it shorter and shorter for several weeks(sob), but I have found alot of great wigs and ball caps to put over the wigs.  Surprisingly, its very cute.  Tender Loving Care has some very cute wigs, turbans, and scarves.  Also Halo Wigs.  Lets all keep in touch and may God guide our journey during the next several months.  Keep the faith ladies!!!!",

But I won't know until I start.  My mind is my worst enemy at this point.  I appreciate all the info. Lana-The oncotype dx is a test that is performed on your tumor to see what the likelyhood of reoccurance will be.  They do have a great website.  They use a number of different factors to get their results.  The Ki-67 is a factor, but not the sole factor in determining this number.  Mine was 97 percent and my onco score was 44.  Both of these are high numbers which is why I am starting chemo on July 10.  I have already had my port and knock on wood have had no problems at all.  One of the easiest surgeries thus far. Like the chemo, I think it depends on the person.  I did order a wig from tlc and it was ok, but I am going out looking for another one today.  I feel better trying it on and need to keep my mind busy.   Honeybunny- I am right there with you sister.  NOT looking forward to it, but we will get through it.  Glad we can all come here and cry on each others shoulders.  I have had alot of people tell me they wished they could take this disease off of me.  I don't think they would say that if they only knew. You all know,  and its nice to be able to talk to someone who really understands the hopes and fears.   I know someone who was recently diagnosed with inoperable esphogile cancer.  I am sure he would jump on the chance to receive any chemotherapy treatments.  So I try to keep that in mind when I become afraid.  We have a chance and we will get better!!!!!  Thank God we have that opportunity.  Enjoy the beautiful day everyone!    ",

I have always been diet prone, exercised too, but Like you said Rambo, we can do everything right and still get it. Makes me crazy to see someone puffing on their cancer stick(cigarette),or unhealthy, and yet nothing happens to them. It was our destiny, yet with treatment we have a second chance. Some will not get so lucky. So in the meantime, I have decided to eat what I want to eat when I want to eat it. After treatments there will then be enough time to get on a well balanced diet again. I am hoping that the not so good foods I am eating I will hate after the tastebuds return. lol.

We are lucky in the fact that we truly know we are loved and by so many. Most leave this earth never knowing. We know and have a second chance and I am going to make every second count.

I have 16 more radiations to go and then a bell ringing party. I just started Arimidex. Has anyone started that yet? Our cancer center has just signed me up as a counselor to help other breast cancer patients facing the same upcoming treatments. I was thrilled. A way to give back. I am so excited....... Soriya-So happy you are on the mend. It wont be long now. We can all put this behind us. Grace-So sorry your down in the dumps. You have ever reason to feel that way, but look how far you have come? Only 4 little weeks and you will have made that hill and its downhill from there. Hang in there. You got this........ Angela-missing you and sending you positive vibes from Iowa",

Yesterday after taking my shower for work(and being alone in the house) i trudged through the livingroom on my way to the bedroom.  My faithful 9 year old german shepherd dog was lying on the floor and he looked up.  They say dogs dont have facial expressions, but if I could have captured that moment it would have been priceless.  I have always had long hair, and since losing my hair I always keep it covered with a scarf,  so for him to see me with no hair freaked him out!  He knew it was me, and came over ever so slowly and tenatively.  But if looks could tell a story I am sure he would have said \"what the heck happened to your head, and they make a flea spray for that\".  I was laughing so hard I had tears of joy and sorrow at the same time. I can't blame him, I look in the mirror and dont recognise myself either.  But ever loyal, he still doesnt leave my side.   Blessings to all......with minimal side effects.........keep the faith.....   ",

While waiting for my neulasta shot in the waiting room yesterday, I spoke with a woman who was coming in for her consultation of her breast cancer that had returned after 3 years.  Long story short, she chose NOT to receive chemo the first time. Her diagnosis was alot like mine, so made me feel better about my decision.  There are many of us who use every excuse we can not to receive treatment(I know I did at first-maybe it was denial), but even now as I lay here feeling lowsy, I know it was the right thing to do. There are many of us that don't get a treatment plan because the cancer has advanced.  I guess my point is to be grateful we have a chance at a full long life, we just have to get through the bad times.  Keep the Faith ladies......we can and will do this........",

I was scared too, but actually it was alot easier than all the others.  The only issue I always have is them accessing my port.  Hurts like crazy when they access it.  I use the emla cream too. I make them take my labs through vein.  Everyone says it gets easier with more infusions. Mine get worse.  Have someone go with you for the infusion and strike up a good conversation and you will forget that its the Taxol your getting.  Its just like any other infusion except it doesnt make you sick.   Will be praying for you and all the sisters for their infusions and as always minimal side effects....",

Both treatments basically take the same time, although CT gives you 3 weeks to recover in between treatments whereas AC gives you 2.  My cancer is small but aggressive too, so I chose the AC because I have come this far and there is no going back so I wanted the best chance I could get at removing any stray cells.  I dont want any regrets in the future.  If it comes back I can at least say I did the best I could to try and beat this demon.. always go forward and never look back.  Try to enjoy a happy 4th  everyone and just know my thoughts and prayers are with you all.",

Its alot easier giving advise than taking it. I thought I would be so happy nearing the finish line, but I have never felt sicker and weaker. I know this too will pass, but enough is enough. Sometimes I think too much is not a good thing either. I guess one never knows which way to go but to trust our doctors and the man upstairs. I go in for round 11 Wednesday. Fingers crossed......................hugzzzzzz",

I guess time will tell. So many others have had a mastectomy and are still having to have radiation. I would have been pissed to have lost my breast and still need radiation. My cancer was not hereditary, and I figure if it does come back I would rather have it take up residency in my breast than other vital organ. But its not coming back(positive thinking). I am feeling much better now that the chemo has finished and its only been a week. I still have alot of neuropothy though. Had to shave last night. I really detest body hair(except for on my head). I let the hair get long, as it was a welcomed sight. I have about an inch of hair on my head too, but no eyebrows and eyelashes. Strange how that poison works and how long it stays in your body. My onco told me at least 4-5 weeks after the last infusion. Ugh..... Praying for all of you still receiving treatment. We are getting there everyone!!! God Bless you all...",

My breast cancer had not reached my nodes, but there were a couple of spots that they though were scar tissue in my lung and liver. If they are gone then I guess they were cancerous. If they are still there then they are scar tissue. As long as nothing else pops up. I am trying not to get anxious, but you all know how that goes. I wonder if that feeling will ever go away.

I figured the \"recipe\" called for 12 weekly taxols, and even though I did get 1 \"free\" week. Thought I would continue. Hope and pray the neuropothy doesnt continue. Just didnt want to go on steroids again and start all over with the taxotere when they both carry the same side effects. I guess I will see what happens, Going for treatment today as a chia pet. I hope the patients have a sense of humor, but at our cancer center not so sure. Doesnt matter, if I don't laugh and have a good time there I dont think I could make it. Laughter is the best medicine. Praying for all of us still receiving treatment for minimal side effects and for the sisters finished.",

I had requested the test, as I really needed to know that we licked the cancer and it wasn't brewing anywhere else. Fingers crossed. Angela-I have missed you!!!! I too have the \"sick chick,hair slick\" look. I think we could start a fad. At first I thought the hair was a platinum blonde, which would have been ok since I am a blonde, but hell no its turning gray! Bring on the clarol. lol. Rambo-I am doing the clinical trial for arimidex. I have not started yet, but I see my onco next week for my test results and then I start the pill. Gee, I have not taken \"the pill\" in years. I was spayed years ago and thought I had taken care of that problem but now more pills. OY! We will have to keep in touch to see how we are doing. Thus far I am on radiation 9 of 28. So getting there. I can't wait to ring AND lick that damn bell. I have a party planned and have a trip to Vegas to catch the fireworks display. It was only fitting that after all we have been through this past year, to end it with fireworks, but in a good way. To say farewell to the past and hopes for the future. I will carry you all in my heart, knowing what all of us firecrackers have endured and came through it. Good riddance 2013! So on this Thanksgiving Eve, I just want to thank all of you sisters for being there. I could have never made it without you. This Thanksgiving will be bittersweet as I have so much to be thankful for, and as strange as it may sound, I am thankful that my cancer was caught and was treatable. So many others are not so lucky. We are also lucky in the fact that we KNOW and have felt the love of our family, friends, and some people we have never met like each other during our illness. Again most people will never know that love until its too late. God Bless all of you.........Happy Thanksgiving!",

I think its normal to have anxiety before each transfusion.  Its the fear of the unknown.  Even though I have only had one, you still worry what the next one will be like.  So we all worry, but the sooner we start, the sooner we are done.  I am happy to get this next one over.  Lets \"get er done\".   I am on day 13 and ready for round 2.  Hair is now really starting to fall out(everyone said day 14 and it has held true-for me anyway) so after transfusion, i  have a hair appointment with several friends who are cutting hair too.  Plan on making a fun day of it.  Not going to let this cancer take control of anything else.  If hair is going, I will make it on my terms.  lol.  I did have long hair, but cut it shoulder length after the first transfusion.  Then I matched my wig to the new hair style.  I found a wonderful shop in Omaha Nebraska(if anyone is close) called BRAVADOS.  They are amazing and match the wig to the color and type of hair that you have.  They are reasonable too.  Stay away from HALO wigs online.  They are a scam and you will not receive your product.  We are all gorgeous beautiful women !!!!!  Good Luck Girls....praying for you all.....",

If you had any issues before the cancer, the chemo seems to escalate it.  I have always had issues with my sinuses and throat all through my life(should have had tonsils out as a kid).  Since my infusions, seems like the chemo hits them first.  I totally understand wanting to quit, and on my last infusion cried in my mo office because I didnt want to do it.  I am sure I will do it again this time because I really feel crummy.  But like all of the sister have said its round 3 and then only 1 left.  Just so hard to imagine getting through it.  But we will do it!   White blood counts have been down so havent made it to work which makes things worse.  I know several women who have continued to work all through their treatments.  God Bless them!  Wish I knew the secret. You never know mama, the next treatment could be easier or the same as the first.   I have and will continue to pray for all of us.........",

I have iced since the first infusion of Taxol, and I still ended up with neuropothy. Numbness and loss of feeling in toes and hands. I have been fighting fatigue, and now fighting strep throat AGAIN! On the positive side, I still work 32-40 hours per week. So very much doable. Even though it sucks going in each week, the weeks seem to be flying by. My daughter and I have done one fund raiser and have a concert planned at the end of the month. With the proceeds we plan on buying gas/grocery cards and handing them out during Thanksgiving to the patients. I have looked in the eyes, and met so many of the patients in the waiting room and we felt it was time to do something for just for them. Its bad enough to have this damn disease let alone being depleted of any/all your savings to receive treatment and then to try and have enough gas to get to weekly or daily treatments. I wont even mention the costs of prescriptions. It may not be a lot, but every little bit helps. I also took up knitting when I was first diagnosed. I have made over 30 scarves and hats that I am taking to the patients. Knitting has been so therapeutic for me and may bring comfort to those that cant afford a hat/scarf. So happy that we are nearing that finish line, and so great to hear how everyone is doing. Bring on 2014. We are the firecrackers, and I personally can't wait for that 2014 fireworks display to ring in the new year.....HUGZZZ to all",

The not knowing.  Oh, make no mistake the treatments were no picnic, but I would do it all over again to live.  Now I think everyday is a bonus and I for one plan on making it count.   I thought of the new patients just getting diagnosed and how scared they are.  I became a volunteer for our local cancer center and Monday I get to speak with my first patient who requested to speak with another breast cancer patient(I guess I can say survivor at this point).  I hope I can ease their mind and I pray for words of encouragement for her.  Happy New Year to all of you.........God Bless us all",
