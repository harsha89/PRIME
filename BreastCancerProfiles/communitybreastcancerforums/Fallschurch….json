It took about an hour, but was just us with the nurse in a room. Not really a class as much as a pre Op for chemo. We then went for the port placement. Unfortunately it was scheduled for 2 which made for a long day without food or drink. The nurse put my iv in a very awkward place on my inner arm. She said my \u201cbest\u201d vein had been stuck recently and she didn\u2019t want to use it. Right before my turn she comes it and gives me iv antibiotics. It actually hurt going in- I think from where she put the iv. this made me anxious and nauseous. But they wheeled me in and I went to sleep and woke up with it in. I am very sore today. My neck hurts and I am sore where it is. I am sure it will get better but I am glad I have 6 days until chemo so it can calm down The port make it feel all too real. Big hair cut today. I will post pictures. I hope everyone has a good week.   ",

When I went to bed last night it hurt to put my hair on the pillow. I was also sick of seeing hair fall all the time. I went to the local barber and was lucky to be the only customer and the barber was a woman. She kept up a steady stream of talk I didn\u2019t understand while I cried in the chair. I put the beanie on and left without looking in the mirror. It took about 3 hours at home before I worked up the nerve to look. I am not going to lie- it is pretty ugly. But it will grow back. It is only hair. But can we have a conversation about Velcro head? It is kinda funny. The beanie clings to it. Feels so strange. But it gives me hope that nothing will slip off. 😀 How are my March 11 ladies doing? And we had 3 start this week. Dianab, Chickeywickey and PokeySpider. How are those SEs coming?

What I struggle with is trying to have a few days off the pills. I tried to get through Friday without anti nausea pills, but that just made me feel \u201coff\u201d. So I will try again today. I think this new plan is like the Taxol part of the ladies doing AC+T. Every Monday. I keep telling myself- only 5 more. I just hope I can keep my white count up so I don\u2019t have to delay The Allergist I saw on Monday finally cracked the hives. I had them for 2 weeks straight. I am finally hive free. And no worries about spring pollen. I am on so many antihistamines that pollen can\u2019t touch me. I hear you all about the taste thing. I will definitely have some new Hates after this is all over. My first time ginger was awesome. Not anymore. Poky. I still have hair. It is short, but much like your volume. My husband calls me \u201cfuzzy\u201d. I am not sure I will lose any more on the Abraxane. I was walking yesterday and got hot so actually walked down my street bald. Good thing it is spring break and most people are out of town.

My MIL has ordered me to keep away from humans. And wear a mask it I talk to anyone. I really don\u2019t need to get sick right now. Bummer is there is nothing to do to raise it - because I can\u2019t take Neulasta. So I am praying that on Monday I can have my \u201cdouble\u201d. Cytoxan and Abraxane. The thing that has freaked me out is we are just going to skip that dose of Abraxane. And that it won\u2019t matter. That freaks me out a little. If I needed 6 single Abraxane, I should get 6. If5 is enough, then why don\u2019t people just get 5???? My sister gets here on Friday for a few weeks to take care of me. I keep warning her that I am pretty boring and am avoiding crowds quite a bit. She swears she is chill about it. Everyone check in and let us know how it is going.

It was good to get some sun on my face. I am day 6. I feel like I finally turned a corner on #2. Bone pain was there. But less. Nausea was worse. And knock wood that the constipation stays away. GHCpd. I am sorry the bone pain was so rough. I understand and hope it is gone. I take that Claritin and really think it could be worse, but it is amazing how lousy it makes you feel. Boobietrap (LOVE the name) ah. The hair. During My good week of TC #1. So week 3 I started shedding. I would tug on my hair. It started as 3 hairs. Then 10. Then 50. I got tired of messing with it. And my scalp hurt. So I buzzed it. I am now Day 6 of #2 and I am 85%bald. It is still falling out- the stubble. But I have some pretty big patches. And what is there hurts- especially when I go against the grain. I am rocking the beanie. And scared the neighbor kids today when I was hatless in the yard. To their credit they took it like champs. LizzieAG. I hope you are keeping the SEs at bay. Everyone enjoy your Sunday. Before we start again next week. Jean",

I had thin gloves on to protect my hands from the ice. I changed them every 30 minutes- so I needed more than one set. I put them in the centers freezer in between so they can get cold again. My treatment center also had a freezer filled with gel ice blocks. So tomorrow you could have her put her feet and hands on them (wearing thin socks and gloves) And then you could research online for gloves, etc. you will need to switch the ice blocks every 45 minutes or so. No neuropathy yet, but I think it starts later during treatment. I think some MOs recommend B-6 for neuropathy.

The MO thinks I am allergic to Taxatare. She indicated she has seen this late onset reaction- I am 10 days post TC#2. The pharmacist thinks it is the Neulasta. So they are changing both. I still skip this week, then go in the 15th for C and a new drug. Abraxane- maybe. No Neulasta. Then the FOLLOWING 2 Mondays I go in for just the Abraxane. So I have 2 more C (with 3 week breaks) and 6 A. Every week. They will be doing blood every week, so if my counts are bad, they will send me home with the shots. Bla. I have to figure out the SEs for the new chemo. And do I now fast before them? Cold therapy hands and feet? I also have to change my surgery date for the implants. Swelling is better. Hives are almost gone. But the ITCH. Still there. I hope everyone is enjoying the day with minimal SEs. We have had some people starting last week. Please let us know how you are doing. And we have a couple starting this week. Best of luck! And take your Claritin. Jean",

Maybe they can shed some light.  And thanks everyone for the kind comments. I am just whining this week. I will get a better attitude soon.",

She said that in the short run implant people are happier with the outcome. And that long term DEIP flap people are happier with the outcome. But I still picked implants. After all I have been through, a tough recovery was not for me. Also the DEIP can get fat with you. But the implants are that size forever. I always said my only goal was to never wear a bra again. So I like the small size! Day one after my double infusion (Cytoxan and Abraxane). But my LAST double and my last Cytoxan. Only 2 more Abraxane to go. So far nausea and fatigue. But what else is new. I was able to walk 10,000 steps yesterday before the premeds wore off so that is good. I see the light at the end of the tunnel. I hope. I hope you all are well and that your SEs are minimal. Hydrate. Rest. Walk. Jean",
