Some days will be good and others will be harder. Some days you can be strong and others you just want to cry. Do what feels right. It's time to take care of you. My doctor gave me very little information so I asked for my pathology report from my biopsy. I was then able to research and educate myself the best I could.",

He told me that if my biopsy came back negative, Tamoxifen will help me because of my family history. To give you a little background. My cousin has the BRCA2 mutation. My aunt was diagnosed when she was 40. My grandmother died from BC when she was 42. Three of my grandmother's sisters were diagnosed anywhere from 33-40. My great grandmother has BC and ovarian cancer. My genetic testing came back negative but I was just diagnosed at 41.",

My surgeon takes a month off at the holidays and he didn't want to do the surgery before he went on vacation. So, I wait. He doesn't come back until 1/12. I had my biopsy on 12/2. How long were you bruised? I still have bruising and swelling. The surgeon requested a PET scan but my insurance denied it. They said I was operable so this scan is not needed. Bleh. The surgeon says he is going to try no chemo or radiation with me. He put me on Tamoxifen before the biopsy just in case. It's funny. I really try to wake up happy and to have a good day. I think it may last 2-3 hours then something blows to hell. Maybe anti-anxiety is really what I need.",

Last week, I had my biopsy. The doctor used a local..shouldn't have been a problem. Well, after 4 or 5 shots of local, the needle went in. Just my luck, the local didn't take. I can't even describe the pain. Luckily, after another 6 or so shots, the rest of the biopsy was done. I went back in this Tuesday and the doctor told me I had lobular cancer. PET scan some time next week. I attempted to work on Wednesday but that didn't go over well. I'll be working from home until surgery. I'm just trying to fumble through it. I keep telling myself it will get better. It has to right? Does the whirl wind stop?
