I am 33 years old had a BMX on may 21, I opted for the surgery to give me the greatest peace of mind going forward (even though my chance of recurrence is still not 0), and because my boobs were smaller and a lumpectomy would have left me very scarred. My right was prophylactic but this way I will feel most even. I had surgery on a Monday and was off major pain meds that Thursday. I was able to do nipple sparing so my incisions start under and come up the outsides. This also allowed my bs to take lymph nodes from the same incision. I did have to go the tissue expander route due to skin becoming stressed but it will be worth it. The node biopsy site was the most painful and still bothers me some. Overall I was feeling really good a lot faster than I expected. Since surgery I got my oncotype score and learned I do not need rads or chemo just tamoxifen which I started 3 days ago. The waiting is the worst by far, and I hope my story can calm some anxious nerves. You got this ladies!",

Right after surgery I looked deflated, like they took a needle to my boobs and popped them like balloons. My skin ended up getting stressed because my surgery took twice as long as they anticipated so my ps left the te\u2019s empty for the first 2 weeks to let things heal without any additional stressing. Be prepared for your areolas to turn dark purple, like really dark purple!! Mine did for a few days and then started to pink up. They then scabed over and that took a good 4-5 weeks to stop. This may or may not happen to you but don\u2019t freak out! I was a small B cup prior to surgery and I have no idea how big I am now. My expanders have 225cc in them and up until the last fill I had they did not bother me at all. Now they\u2019re annoying I may actually ask my ps to remove a little bit of the saline in hopes the uncomfortableness will go away. Good luck this coming week!",

And when things are finally said and done my quality of life is really going to get back to normal (for the most part). I'm not loosing my eyesight, going deaf, I'm not loosing a limb that will limit my mobility.... I do want to share a good story I was told over the weekend. My lifelong best friend's grandmother had breast cancer at 55, had a single mastectomy and chemo and radiation. She had it come back in the other breast at 86. She survived again and is 96 now! When asked if she would fight it again if it comes back she said \u201cof course I would!\". So as physical as the treatments are for this disease they'd are also very mental too! A good strong mind set does wonders for treatment, recovery, and survival",

This procedure is to investigate a small spot my first mri picked up, could be nothing or could be something, but my surgeon is insisting we find out now before I\u2019m in surgery. She does not want to have to take lymph nodes from both arms of she can help it. I agreed with her and would rather be poked with a few more needles then have issues down the road with my lymph nodes.",

Getting out of the house for a bit helps brighten spirits too. Just wish I could shake the dizziness, I was out for almost 9 hours so my surgeon thinks I have a bit of a hangover from the anesthesia. Trying to drink lots of fluids and eat protein at every meal.  How do the drains feel coming out? Painful or just odd??",

Not sure if it\u2019s related to lymph node removal or just unused muscles for 8 weeks, but I\u2019m trying to force myself to awkwardly use my right arm instead for now. I also am super aware of my TE\u2019s after the past two days. They are prepectoral so again not sure if it\u2019s because this last fill finally bothered me or again not using the muscles for 8 weeks. I don\u2019t go back to the plastic surgeon for two weeks so hopefully I can stand them that long! I\u2019m only up to 225cc but may make her take some out! Also i\u2019m super jealous of those who have their exchanges scheduled! My ps won\u2019t do it until at least 3 months from my original surgery so that would be August 21. Due to scheduling issues if she can\u2019t fit me in those last 10 days of August I\u2019ll have to wait until October :( On a random side note...two years ago today I went into labor with my baby girl!! She turns two tomorrow at 434am!! She\u2019s my world and has given me the strength to fight this beast the best I can!",

I can do most things myself now like prepare food, shower, etc. It takes some practicing to figure somethings out but most things are doable.

My ps said spanx would be helpful for the lipo areas so I\u2019m on the hunt for a second pair, and a few sports bras that zipper in the front (so I don\u2019t have to use the hospital stuff!)",

I was looking at my implant card and I actually ended up with 235cc implants, smaller than I was expecting but dressed (even with a sports bra on) I think I\u2019m a little bigger than pre surgery. I look like myself with clothes on (naked forget it!), and that makes me feel better. Good luck to this event still going through this surgery stuff!",
