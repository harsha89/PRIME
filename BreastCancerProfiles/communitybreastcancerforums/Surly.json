I'm on it right now and do find it fairly easy, especially after being on Taxotere. And it does sort of seem like a chemo needs to make you suffer in order to feel like it's working. But that is upsetting to think that some might consider it palliative. My onc had been deciding between it and Doxil for me. She says that Gemzar's results are roughly: 4% complete response, 40% partial response, 40% stable disease. With Doxil, she said 45% to 50% of patients have a partial response and 40% stable. She didn't say if any had a complete response. These are hand-written notes. I didn't do any research on my own. I understand the fear of feeling like maybe the oncologist might give up on me, but I don't feel that and don't think that will happen. I do expect to run out of options at some point and will be told such. But I don't think she'll hold out on me and not tell me about other treatment options. From some questions posted on other threads I've sensed that is what some patients are hearing, but I don't know the whole picture--how their health is otherwise. But I do fear that some health professionals might not understand why an older person would want to pursue aggressive treatment. And it's clear that some who are low income or lack insurance are not offered as many options.  I hope Gemzar works for you. I'll report back about my experience. Still, if you care to share where you heard about the palliative description--from other patients? nurses?--I'd like to know. Good luck.",

A more charitable thing would be to say, \"You might not realize that when you suggest that I'm going to die soon, it sounds like you're threatening my life.

There are so many so-called Christians who have a sense of entitlement when it comes to people's spiritual business because of their orders to evangelize. I've heard a minister preach about how appalled he was that parents sued him for handing the Gospels out to public schoolchildren after they were let out of school. How dare they!

But when I'm taking ritalin I manage pretty well. I sometimes feel a moment or two of nausea a few days later, but if I pop a Zofran I'm good to go.  I do continue to have nasal passage issues--dry, raw, runny, bloody, crusty. Sometimes I hardly have airflow through one of my nostrils from the buildup, particularly in the morning. I know that the runny nose from herceptin is mostly to blame. It's like a river chiseling away stone to carve a canyon and so the skin is always tender. Plus a rash of other chemos have added to the problem. Plus winter dryness. I'm trying to remember--or bother--to use Ocean nasal spray a couple times a day. That seems to help. I have hot flashes but think that's the hormone repression and not the fever/chills that they say is a possible SE. Oh, my nails continue to crack. Seems like almost every nail will get a little vertical slit as if by an exacto knife. Then I proceed to catch the nail on sweaters. So I have to keep trimming the nails almost to the bed. They'll grow out a little and then crack. Maybe that's partially due to winter, but this has never happened before.  My hair is growing. I lost it last July-August when I did Perjeta+Taxotere+Herceptin. When it grew back it seemed super thin and pokey. Six months later (late Feb), it was long enough to have a smidge of it trimmed off to clean it up and for me to go hatless for the first time. It was still very short and you could see scalp if the hair wasn't pushed around just right. I use some waxy hair products so it isn't fuzzy and looks intentionally short and bed-heady. It has since grown a little more and so I'm at the point of deciding whether to trim it again--love the short and easy 'do--or let it grow out once more. Assuming that there will be a day when I lose it again.",

The first infusion was a slow infusion over 90 minutes and they checked BP every 30 minutes. Then I had 90 minutes of saline and observation. Subsequent infusions were given fast--30 minutes with 30 minutes of saline/observation. I really can't say I've ever felt crappy on this. A little fatigue and one or two passing waves of nausea is all. I wonder if the hangover feeling you've had was in part from the steroid crash. That's how I felt--on top of the chemo crap. Check back and let us know how it goes. Spam, I'm sorry I can't give you a good guess. But I would bet that if this level of hip pain is new that after two or three infusions you might notice relief. Total guess though, and based solely on the fact that they generally scan after three or four infusions. My bone mets (which are extensive) have been stable for a long time on various chemos. Lately I've felt a little hip pain, but that might be due to reducing my morphine because I think I was overdoing it--I never felt pain at all, so I decided to ease up and see where the edge was. That was just a month or so ago, right after starting TDM1. So either I'm sitting on the edge of pain or have been sleeping on it wrong or maybe have some progression there. ",

In any case, my thoughts: -It doesn't bother me that they're goal isn't to \"find a cure.\" I don't think every BC nonprofit needs that as their mission. I think that as long as their mission and tactics are aligned, they're serving the population they want, and they're not deceptive, that's fine with me. My beef with SGK is that they are deceptive in what they say they're doing. They have no intention of finding a cure or putting enough resources in that area, yet they say that that's what they're doing. -What does Twin Peaks mean by \"research\"? When people hear that word, they immediately think it's lab research to find a cause and seek a cure. But research can mean anything. It could mean research into whether more brunettes get BC than redheads. Where are they putting their research dollars? -The disconnect I see in Twin Peaks' message is that they layout the stage IV stats (which is refreshing) but then make the assumption that those stats would simply go away if people would just schedule a mammogram--that early detection is the key to eliminating stage IV ever happening. That is a big misconception, as we all know. Perhaps that's what he needs to hear. -Maybe you could explain to him--or encourage him to talk to an oncologist--about the facts that a lot of BC is not caught from mammograms and ultrasounds, that it can progress to later stages without any symptoms and despite screening. Perhaps if early detection is ever going to be the answer, then scientists need to develop other, more sensitive screening tests in blood or body chemistry. -If you don't want to call him, just write him and say that you're not comfortable doing so but then address his line about \"trying to find ways to best help the group you represent.\" What are the things you'd like a nonprofit like this do to help you? Things that come to my mind: Busting the myths created by SGK and an ignorant public; awareness of the realities for stage IV people (nonstop treatment, debilitating SEs, high rates of job loss and financial insecurity or bankruptcy, etc.); too much research geared to stopping early stage instead of into how metastasis happens. I'll leave it at that. I don't know why I'm so chatty tonight. Must have been the sun and fresh air. ...Thanks for starting the thread.",

And so when I had my big fund-raiser for the organization I volunteer for, I sent them all the \"ask.\" Not a single one of them gave one thin dime. Meanwhile, I have been added to the all sorts of mailing lists because of writing a $25 check years ago. Having been involved in too many fund-raisers, I understand the fatigue of being asked 20 times a year to give to something.

I'm wondering if one's body can have both Her2+ and Her2- tumors or if they would all change according to the \"dominate\" one. Formygirls, I'm so glad to see you on the boards! Keep us posted on if you do a biopsy and what you learn. Keep fighting!!",

I think under 20% increase in size is considered within margin of error (though I don't trust my memory on that). My biggest progression was 40% net increase. I.e., one liver lesion was slightly smaller but the larger one was significantly bigger so net increase was \"just\" 40%. I've always taken it under advisement of the onc about the next step. I don't think staying with a regimen has ever been advised. So far they've always had a couple different options for me to consider next. Good luck!",

If you saw the Coen brothers' film Fargo (which was mostly set in Minneapolis but also ND), that accent is exaggerated but accurate. Rural relatives in Minnesota and North Dakota do say, \"Ohhh yahhh?\" It's the Norwegian and Swedish influence but mostly in outstate.

I think only mythical \"church ladies\" say \"hot dish\" these days. I think I grew up saying both hot dish and casserole. But the latter was the cookware and the former was the Tuna Noodle Surpise that might be cooked in it. I never hear anyone say \"hot dish\" these days. Curiously, I commonly now hear people say \"drug\" instead of \"dragged.\" I never heard that growing up but now hear educated people who grew up in rural MN and IA say that. Minnesotans say \"ish\" instead of \"ick.\" They used to say \"pop\" but most now say \"soda.\" They often say \"not too bad\" (which means \"fine\" or \"great\") in response to the question \"how are you?\" or \"how was your weekend?\"  Another common thing is to put \"then\" on the end of a question, I think to soften it so it doesn't sound demanding, \"So how's the new tractor working then?\"",

You can try some tricks (many of us are on Ritalin or Concerta to combat fatigue) to deal with fatigue. And WBC counts getting hit is also common.

You don't say when you were diagnosed and how long you've been dealing with stage IV, but I think that most friends can't sustain giving attention to an ill person beyond a certain number of months. I think 6 is when their concern wanes. They want resolution: getter better or die. That might be a part of it.  But I also know that the things I need to talk about do scare people. My husband gets silent and would rather not go there. My sister gets upset even though she thinks she can handle it. My sister-in-law, when I told her I wanted to make plans for many of my belongings, conveyed she thought I was giving up and she went on about there's always hope. I went through long periods of anger and frustration with the close people in my life who didn't \"get it.\" I felt isolated and lonely and thus scared. I felt like a foreigner in a land where no one spoke my language. Many of my friends and family members seemed to want to understand, so I tried explaining. But many still can't get it.  I've always known that people who do not have a terminal illness will never understand what it's like to face one's mortality. But I've also come to realize that many people in my life have such strong denial that they can't or won't understand the grim reality. It occurred to me that it would be far easier to teach my cat to read than it would be to make these people see it. So I stopped trying. I don't bring it up to those who go silent. I think they're scared, not annoyed. If someone makes an incorrect assumption--such as musing that I'll get to stop chemo at some point since I look and seem healthy and coast along all healthy for a long time--I will explain the facts. The point is that I am so much happier now that I've lowered my expectations of others. I do still need a couple people in my life I can talk to who do understand. And I have those few. Everyone else will just have to decide for themselves how much they want to face. It can be hard for me when my husband keeps some of it at arm's length. But I can't force him. I just have to do what I need and give him the space. I know he'll step up when needed because he always has. I got to this place because of the passage of time and working on my own issues. Later on, maybe 3 or 4 months ago, I started an antidepressant, which has made dealing with it all so much easier. I still get frustrated and angry with others and the whole deal, but it washes over faster. It's OK not to enjoy every damn day or live each one to the fullest. We're not robots. And feeling guilty about not smiling at every sunset makes it even worse. Forgive yourself and everyone else and try again tomorrow. You mention other BC friends who handle it better and have a positive attitude. Well, I think that's a front. No one who is worth her salt is positive 24/7. I would take them in small doses.

I never have trouble sleeping, as long as steroids aren't in my life.  What I do to deal with anxiety: I stay in the moment as much as possible. I try to laugh at things. I used to become upset or annoyed at all kinds of things: if the cats destroyed something, if someone was careless and broke something \"valuable,\" if we got water in the basement, if the meal and service were a disaster when we dined out. Now I try to let it roll off or try to laugh it off. I treat myself all the time. I don't spend a lot of money (I hate shopping), but I buy delicious desserts and eat what I want. I buy things that make me happy--like the white fluffy, fleecy cloudlike cardigan I'm wearing right now. I stopped bringing work home. When the house needs cleaning, I flip the dust bunnies the bird. There are better things to do, like reading Vanity Fair and eating the overpriced hand-packed spumoni from the Italian market down the road.  When I had a lot of anxiety that was paralyzing me, I also started seeing a therapist--for a few months. But I am also a reader and that's where I usually seek info and wisdom. A couple books/authors in particular truly saved me from myself. I'm not into meditation (I would fall asleep in a split second) and I'm not a Buddhist, but the writings of these American Buddhists helped me become comfortable with uncertainty and fear. These are not religious books or teachings and in fact have devotees who are Christians, Jews, and probably many other religious. Anyway, I'm referring to Charlotte Joko Beck (Everyday Zen) and Pema Chodron (The Places that Scare You). I'm not saying I don't have my anxiety attacks and dark valleys, but these things help.  I like that visual imagery idea. I should do more of that. I would like to envision my self at age 75, enjoying retirement in Hawaii. I should go on a fact-finding mission there so I get the details right.",

I also have bought some scarves that are about 18 or 20 inches wide and about 40 inches long and that have long fringe on the ends. I start by covering the top of my head and letting the sides drape down. Then I twist those long sides and wrap them around my head. Each one will coil once around. And then I tie the two ends in a knot--actually just half a knot--in the back. They're long enough to flow down and the fringe hangs down almost the way a pony tail would. It has nice drape. It's best to have pretty lightweight fabric though. I've been wearing one all evening to make sure it will stay put because I want to wear it to work tomorrow. It looks more elegant than a square scarf that you fold into a triangle and then tie a big knot at the side or nape.",

But I'm not sure it's worth a new thread: We all have people in our lives who don't get it or can't talk about it for whatever reason and it can be hurtful or confusing and frustrating. But something has been bothering me about a couple friends of mine who are kind of the opposite of that. I'm wondering if others have people like this in their lives.  These two friends--who are from different parts of my life and don't know each other--always seem to want me to wallow in woe is me stuff. They might pity me a little, which is off-putting and condescending. But they are also big-hearted people. One of them has her own chronic health issues (one of which could prove fatal if not controlled). And she projects on me all her perceptions and experiences. She thinks I find all the tests and appointments dispiriting, that dark and depressing days dominate my life, that I must struggle to go on. I tell her that, no, that's not how I feel at all, that I love my life and enjoy most days, though obviously some are excruciatingly difficult emotionally if not physically. She sends nice cards and e-mails about being in her thoughts. But they all stem from an assumption that I'm terribly unlucky. The other friend is in pretty good health, but she also assumes that I drag a big cross around everywhere I go. She sighs and says, \"Oh, why is life so hard and unfair\" no matter what the health update is (it's usually going to be a mixed bag, as we know). And since I've been diagnosed, she always tries to pay for lunch, which is very irksome (and not just because she has huge credit card debt); it again is a sign of pity. She sends me little inspirational passages to save me from the depths of despair when I'd much rather she send links to funny cat videos like she used to. I told her once I had not time for pity, but she probably doesn't recognize it. These are all kind, heartfelt acts. But they clearly are not seeing me--or listening to what I say. It's become depressing and I feel the tug to avoid them. These are both smart women, and one is a counseling psychologist. Do any of you have people like this in your life? ",

And I know we need to be careful about topics like religion, but I love the discussion and want to add a couple thoughts. I'm no apologist for religion or Christianity, but I think the idea that those who remain faithful through their suffering brings glory to God basically means that the faithful are not blaming God for their suffering or for their lot in life. It's easy to glorify God when you're safe, warm, well-fed, healthy, rich, beautiful, etc. To do so when you're Job and covered with sores and have lost your home and family is supposed to testify to God's ultimate goodness.  Those who say they prayed away the cancer are mistaken. Essentially they are saying that they control God. They are so freaked out about uncertainty, which is all that life really is, that they prefer religion to be like magic. That way, nothing needs to be logical or scientific. If you believe in magic for your religion, then you just need to say the right words and act certain ways and have certain attitudes and believe strongly enough, and, voila, you're going to get in the right school or get the job or be cured. If the cure doesn't happen, then you can blame a lack of  focus, a negative attitude, too much gin 20 years ago, or whatever keeps the magic real. Although I have my doubts about God quite a bit (I mostly ignore God they way my cat would ignore me when I'd return home after a long weekend away), when I am in a believing state I don't believe God causes suffering, I believe God allows suffering. It's part of the rules of the game of free will. I don't believe the cancer miracles that we hear about on the boards or in the news. It's ridiculous and reckless to claim people are miraculously cured, imo, when scientists do not understand enough about the disease and why it behaves inconsistently. None of the stories about being cured qualify as miracles. If a cancer patient died and was dead for a few days and then got up and started tap dancing again, that would be a miracle. Everything less is just a lucky event and a head scratcher--and should give scientists reason to look more closely at that patient to see how he or she differed from other patients. I don't think God intervenes--or not the way we think. I've heard some pretty astounding supernatural stories from reliable sources and family members. But nothing is provable. It's why we use the words \"faith\" and \"belief.\"  I think it was C.S. Lewis who said something like, \"Prayer doesn't change God, prayer changes me.\" That to me makes sense and makes prayer very worthwhile, even for a skeptic. I also believe this: \"Pain is inevitable; suffering is optional.\" But that's for another thread. Back to the OP, I don't believe most of those \"miraculous\" cure stories. I do know that it's possible to be NED for 10 or 20 years--or maybe longer. What I don't know is how to believe that that could happen for me--and relax with that image of making future plans with the expectation that I'll be around to do them--while at the same time I focus daily on meds, infusions, scans, progression, and narrowing options. Is it possible to live both ways simultaneously--with unhindered optimism and gritty realism? If others know how, please share how you perform these mental gymnastics.",

And I flinched every time he said it--only a few times in two years. But I thought of telling him that he shouldn't use that term but always refrained. I really like him, because he was buoyant and up on research, aggressive with treatment but also kind and listened to me. But he didn't seem to get how hard it is to hear \"terminal.\" The first time I saw him and he told me how advanced my cancer was, we didn't talk about prognosis, but I knew. And I had in my mind I had 1-5 years, knowing how extensive it was. After my appointment, I walked out to the reception area to wait for the scheduler. I was sitting on a coach with my head in my hands and the onc came out with what he thought was an additional reassuring piece of info. He said, \"I recently had a patient, a dancer, with a similar diagnosis, and she lived 4 years!\" And then he bounded back to his office. I just didn't know what to think--being new to cancerworld and needing to just get going on the other tests and the port implant--and didn't want to start shopping for an onc. And other than that, I thought he was great. He was always helping me keep perspective and find reason to be optimistic when there was progression, but he also did encourage me to travel and do what I wanted when I felt good. And I made him promise to tell me if he thought I should stop working so that I didn't waste good time. But this fall I moved to a new center with a new onc, and she and the PAs are so much more attuned to the mental and emotional health and how it effects the physical and to use drugs, therapy, yoga, excercise, accupuncture, whatever. I've looked into some of these before but always thought of them as optionals. But I'm going to try to look at them as essential parts of my treatment plan--and make time for them in the workday or whenever. K-Lo, that's also interesting about challenging your docs. I rarely do that. But once I brought my husband along for a consult before Gamma Knife, and he really pushed them to move the schedule along because I was going too long without chemo (long story). I was kind of embarassed or uncomfortable because I thought he wasn't getting how complicated all the scheduling was, but they perked up and hurried and made phone calls and got me in to see someone later that day to make a decision about proceeding with a new plan, etc.  Anyway, thanks.",

It's been active in rented or various spaces and just raised enough money to start its own building. I've yet to check it out but may. I was diagnosed 2 1/2 years ago--stage IV from the \"get go\"--but am very new to these boards. I dipped in my toe and found the water to my liking, so I think this will probably meet a great many needs for me. But, the rest of the time, I put on a good front. I try to have a spring in my step at work. I don't want to be passed over for things or be seen as being pulled down by this disease. Very few of them even know I'm stage IV. They just think I've \"had a recurrence,\" thus the hair loss and more medical appointments. I think if or when I have to disclose more, I fear I'll be treated like a sick bird that washed ashore after an oil spill and there's no hope for me so just look the other way or move me out of sight. Even when I told people about the BC diagnosis initially (everyone assumed stage I, though I never said one way or the other), I received so many questions from friends and friends' mothers and female co-workers (I have nothing else in common with besides place of employment and gender) about what it was that led me to get checked out. I guess I understand the interest; people are both curious and scared. But the volume of people who asked and the number of ways they asked/pried made me realize they weren't asking because they cared about me or my story, it was about what can they salvage from what's happened to me to better their chances of not getting cancer. Perhaps I'm being uncharitable in that assessment, but I can't ignore the painful feelings that bubbled up the more I was asked. That said something to me. I didn't know what it was at the time, but that is what has stayed with me. I guess my point is that it's so hard to find support no matter what. I'm sure there is a lot more support for early stagers and it gets tougher for the late stagers. And while I really like my onc and that he is into the research and confers with top BC oncs in the country, I do sometimes feel that, in the end, I'm really going to be more of an interesting case for him. He's tried stuff on me he hasn't tried on anyone else, and I guess that's good that he's learning things that might benefit others later.  Oh, dear. Another long, rambling post.",

So I suggested she consider that when asking someone about a big, heavy issue in his or her life. She was thankful for the suggestion. Or seemed to be.",

I've said it before: Well-intentioned people have caused most of the strife in the world. It is not a good excuse for asking inappropriate questions. If these were children asking, then, yes, I'd say they are recognizing that something is different here and maybe know someone else who lost hair to chemo and are making a connection and they ask questions, as they're wired to do. And I would be gentle and as open as I could be, without scaring them, in replying. But adults should know better. The reason I say this is because most of them bungle the comments and end up offending or hurting the person they comment to. If they stopped for a half second and let reason in, they would keep their mouth shut. I think they are curious and have no self-control. They want to know for selfish reasons. I think they see someone who is bald or covering up baldness and have an inner dialogue: \"I bet she has cancer.\" And then want to confirm it. They also might want to prove to themselves that they can be compassionate and say something to \"connect\" with the poor stranger. But it's all for their benefit. I haven't been asked in a long time, but I just lost my hair again and so the next time someone does ask if I'm undergoing chemo, I'm inclined to say, \"How does your invading my privacy help me in any way?\" Or, if I wanted to be really snarky (I'm in a mood today), I would love to say, \"I'll tell you about my chemo if you tell me about your botched nose job / haliotosis / weight loss issues\" (or some other \"flaw\"). OK, that would be getting in the gutter. But my point is that it is pretty cruel to single out a stranger and point out his or her difference in a public place and ask prying questions.  Thanks for indulging me.",

The longer the gaps in between communication with some friends, the more difficult it is for me to bridge that gap. I feel I've changed too much or that I can't relate to them any longer (or I don't try to). I've had a few friends drift farther away recently. I've known them 20 to 30 years. Two are salvageable, I think. But the third, I don't know.  What have you done when friends have drifted away, never followed through on that call or visit, and then resurface without apology with an upbeat note? Meanwhile, they've not been around while you've been going through some rought stuff. I'm also questioning whether I've dropped the ball with some friendships. But something keeps me from intiating contact, maybe since I'm the one who is so focused on day-to-day survival. Do I not reach out because I don't want to seem lonely or needy? Maybe it's that I want them to want to check in with me--because they care, not because it's an obligation.  But the question remains: What do you do when you start losing those once-supportive friends? How do you deal with this? Thanks for your thoughts.  Pardon me, hounded hope, for laughing from time to time. . . . Mets to bones, liver, and lungs. Brain mets treated with gamma knife.

I had tried asking in various ways what she thinks my prognosis is, and she always has said she doesn't know and that they're hopeful that they'll find the right thing to slow the disease down, etc. This spring I asked her if she thought this would be my last good summer because I didn't want to keep working if that were the case. She again danced around it but encouraged me to take more time off. I told her that I understand that docs are reluctant to give prognoses because patients might subconsciously take it as fact and then it becomes a deadline they meet. But I told her I didn't want her to withhold info from me just because I wasn't asking the right questions. She promised me that she would be frank with me when we got to that point. Still, how much time I likely had left was always occupying my mind. Aside from the hair loss, I look OK and usually have OK energy, but over time I've been slowly declining. This summer and fall I progressed on several chemos. I've burned through about 9 of them and am running out of options. A few months ago, I tried a different tact. I said to my onc, \"I know you don't know how much time I have left, but I have a timeframe in my mind and I would like to know if it's ridiculous or if it's in the ballpark, because I'd like to stop thinking about it and just keep marching forward. My sense is that if I'm lucky I'll get 4-6 months on the current chemo. After that, if I'm lucky I'll get 4-6 months on a trial drug. But after that, unless there is another trial I could get into, I won't have any options left. Is my thinking realistic regarding this timeframe?\" She paused a few seconds (I think I kind of cornered her) and then said, \"Yes, I think that's realistic.\" I said, \"Thanks. I can deal with that. I just need to set this wondering aside so I can focus on living.\" So, she didn't exactly say I have X months--and that's not what I wanted to know anyway--I just wanted her to confirm what I had felt.

She thought that was so amazing. And that is a pretty big deal for most women to do. I don't think I'd offer to do that (for other reasons). The solidarity shave has always bothered me. It seems like another way for people to say, \"Now I know how you feel!\" Somehow it makes it about them--makes them heroic and shines a bright beam on their sacrifice. It also seems to perpetuate the myth that hair loss is the worst part of treatment. When, in fact, hair loss is probably the easiest. A bald head is pretty easy to deal with. I didn't have any scalp pain. I opted for scarves over itchy wigs, so that was easy. Yeah, sometimes they got hot or annoying. I cut 30 minutes out of getting ready in the morning. I saved hundreds of dollars for not needing cuts and color (oh, yeah, I did spend a bunch on scarves though). Admittedly, it's not fun. I didn't feel pretty. I looked like a patient. What's worst is that it makes others uncomfortable and prompts them to say awkward things or, the absolute worst, compels them to give the pity smile, which is sooooo patronizing. I've always been the contrarian (which I'm sure caused my cancer!), and that's what makes me want to say, \"A real act of solidarity would be if they cut off a good half pound of breast tissue or at least a nipple and then didn't tell anyone except the friend with cancer.\" Tangent alert. Here is a tip FO ANYONE NEEDING SCARF IDEAS. This will sound like a paid endorsement, but it's not. When I lost my hair, I relied almost exclusively on Buff scarves. These are found at REI (www.rei.com/product/691367/buf... and are about $20 each. They are stretchy and cylincrical--about an 18-inch-long tube--that can be worn numerous ways and come in all kinds of fun patterns and colors. They're made for outdoorsy use around necks or under helmets and can be worn about 10 ways. I wore mine like a do-rag or pirate and then when hair started growing back and was all zany, I wore it like a headband or half-head covering. They made me feel like I had a party going on on top of my head instead of like I should try to fly under the radar like a depressed babushka. So, they're all washed and ready to roll for round 2.",

There may have been a hairline that wasn't noticed at first but that kind of split open because of some trauma that I didn't even realize I'd done--like landing too hard on a big step. The orthopedist was recommending a hip replacement, but I that prospect made me anxious. A co-worker was laid up a long time with hers (but because she had a bad fall and it was a mess). They wanted to do a replacement so that it would be controlled and not a shattered mess if I fell. Still, I wanted to delay and stay on the chemo. My cancer was out of control and a hip replacement seemed like buying really sweet wheels for a junker. The ortho gave me a cane at first and then crutches when the fracture appeared, and I was on Zometa all along. I used the crutches constantly and got good cruising up and down stairs even. I did probably cheat too much and put too much weight on that leg when I shouldn't have, like moving from the sink to the fridge and the like, but it did heal. It's not straight though and I don't have perfect range of motion. And that leg is now 1/4 inch shorter. I'm not sure I made the right decision, but I was so new to the diagnosis and the idea of bone mets. The ortho surgeon didn't have a good answer for me when I asked about whether a hip replacment would even work for me since the bone was so compromised. I do advise going to an orthopedic surgeon to discuss it. I realize I'm lucky that I didn't have a fall that shattered the hip, leaving me in really bad shape.  If you gather good info and expert opinions, you'll feel better about your next step. Good luck!",

I have an appointment for next week but haven't understood the need for counseling/advice/consultation in my case, since knowing won't matter to me. But I do have a lot of younger relatives--nieces and nephews--who could have the gene and pass it on. If I do test positive, we will have to think hard about when and how to divulge the info, because I have heard that, despite the law, that insurance companies might deny coverage if an applicant says he or she knows they have the gene. That is where I hope counseling is helpful. ...I also understand that the test can be expensive and might not be covered by insurance. You can also have it done anonymously, I think.",

I am always leery of company-supported offices, like HR, but this has been a life-saver for me. Do you have anything like that where you work? You do need to make sure you have an advocate who knows ADA. Someone higher up here provided a link. I've used that in the past; check it out. People with disabilities are a protected class, but it doesn't mean you can't legally be fired. You still have to perform your duties. If you're being treated unfairly, you need to connect the principal's actions to your circumstances. It's not necessarily easy, but sometimes simple documentation can show a pattern, timing, word choice. And if you can show that if there are others in your workplace who are not targeted for simimlar performance. Lawyering up might mean the point of no return, because if you keep your job it could become an incredibly hostile place, but you might not have other options. You could also go public. Talk to a reporter. Our paper has a \"whistleblower\" column that often shows how companies are screwing customers or employees, and no one likes to be in that column. ",

Yeah, it might be a male thing, though I have a very attentive brother who checks in all the time despite his crazy busy life and flying cross country every other week. But sometimes I feel like I have lived longer than some people's expectations and so am like a guest who has worn out her welcome. There was such a flurry for six months after I was diagnosed and then one acquaintance said, \"Can I take you off my prayer list now?\" While I don't THINK I'm an Eeyore, I suspect that when I cross people's minds, they think things like, \"cancer, sadness, death, deterioriation, she wouldn't have fun here anyway, don't call she's probably sleeping, what would we talk about, it must not be that bad because she's still alive, she'll let us know when it gets bad.\" But I can just move on from these people. If it were family, I would definitely write an e-mail or letter--something short and unemotional (if possible) stating that you were hurt and disappointed, etc. Some people refuse to stop and reflect a moment and try to think about how others might feel.  Here is something Christopher Hitchens wrote in the intro to Hitch-22 when he was sick but his death was not imminent: \u201cAnother element of my memoir \u2014 the stupendous importance of love, friendship and solidarity \u2014 has been made immensely more vivid to me by recent experience. I can\u2019t hope to convey the full effect of the embraces and avowals, but I can perhaps offer a crumb of counsel. If there is anybody known to you who might benefit from a letter or a visit, do not on any account postpone the writing or the making of it. The difference made will almost certainly be more than you have calculated.\u201d ...I think that you need to express your feelings so you can let it go. The pain and sadness comes from still expecting them to do something they've not indicated they are likely to do.  Again, I'm so sorry. Families are tough.",

      "Content": "Sep 8, 2012 09:08AM - edited Sep 8, 2012 09:11AM by Surly Spamgril, thanks for putting those thoughts into words. I have looked at this issue from many angles over the past 2 1/2 years, and there is just no good answer or outcome. When first diagnosed my goal was to live long enough to get affairs in order, debt paid off, etc., so that my husband wouldn't be left in a precarious situation and so our house wouldn't be at risk. He owns his own business, which has never recovered since the economic downturn of 2008. And it had only half recovered from the post 9/11 economic slump. I say I'm not afraid of dying, and I don't think I am, but I don't know how we can truly know that until it is perhaps immiment. And while I don't want to imagine the grief my mother and siblings and other relatives will experience if I die soon, the hardest thing for me is imagining what is in store for my husband. He's more of a survivor than me; he wouldn't become a recluse like I would if he died on me. But we're a team. I ache thinking about his loneliness and him having to be reliant only on himself (we don't have children). He will probably be entering his retirement years alone (I'm 47; he's 57), and that is the time that we had imagined we would spend more time together enjoying life and travels and everything. One part of me wants to die sooner so that he has more time to find someone new. I would be so happy to know that he had found love and companionship again. Another part of me wants research to stay two steps ahead of my disease so that I always can glide into the next best treatment and function just fine. But, meantime, how do I chase away that dark cloud that is always hanging over us so we could imagine 10 or 20 good years together. We don't even realize how polluted that cloud is until the tension builds over something and we have a meltdown over money or pity or housekeeping. I will say that this disease has made us closer and our relationship deeper than it would have been otherwise. I am grateful for that. But there is still the sad reality of our lives and this disease. Other days I imagine I would feel better if my husband unexpectedly died first. It feels fair that he should die and be at peace and that I, whom I blame for the misery caused by my disease, should have to grieve his loss alone until the cancer gets me. This is just foolish imaginings, of course. I don't wish for it and know better than to try to will an outcome. I rarely pray. And when I pray I rarely ask for what I want. I simply ask that I be able to handle with grace whatever comes. A final thought about the word \"fight.\" I know that people take issue with words like \"fight\" and \"battle\" when it comes to dealing with cancer. I don't feel strongly about those terms. But I must say that I really don't feel like I'm fighting cancer. I'm not a competitive person. I played sports for fun, not to win. If a friend and I both had our eye on the same guy, I would always back down. I think I have always hated the resistance and tension of any kind of fight. Instead, I think I deal with cancer by rolling with it. If I envision my life with cancer as a rapid stream, to fight it would be like clinging to a big boulder in the stream, with water smacking against it and me relentlessly. Instead, I feel like I'm on a log and am navigating my way through the rapids, not wasting my energy where I shouldn't but steering around the trouble spots and finding little coves to rest. When people say I'm a fighter because I get up and go to work every day even though I look wiped out, it just doesn't ring true. I go to work because it's better and easier than the alternative right now. It might not be next week. In some ways, I think I am managing this disease by not fighting it. I must say, however, that the emotional/psychological damage of this disease is far more painful than any physical trauma I have experienced.  If you want an answer to your question: I do think the hardships have been worth it for now. And I do think hardships are not for nought. I believe I will know when the hardships are no longer worth it. And I hope I have the courage and capacity to make the right decision when that happens. Meantime, I hope that you find love and peace in each individual moment. ",
