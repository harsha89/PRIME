I used latisse, before, during and after chemo, and unfortunately I too began losing eyelashes after 4th TC, and it continued for 6 weeks after last chemo treatment. I lost all but a few eyelashes. I have continued with the latisse, but my eyelashes are growing in really curly and going in all crazy directions. The tips are especially curly and lighter than the bases. (They were slightly curly before). I don't know if it is just the effect of growing in after chemo or the latisse, or a combo of both. ",

My Onc did not offer me anything in the way of encouragement. Evidentally my tumor markers before chemo and after the first chemo was normal, and he never rechecked until my last (6th TC) and lays this on me now. Thanks DOC. I shoulde be out celebrating, not freaking out. ",
