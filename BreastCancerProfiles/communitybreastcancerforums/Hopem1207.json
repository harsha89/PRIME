It wasn't the cancer holding me down , its was the pneumonia taking over. How long have you been on Halavan? I started in January and so far things are going ok.",

I'm 41 trying to raise a 4 yr.old little girl while fighting stage IV breast cancer. I don't want to seem bitter, but I just look at some people and want to scream \" I'm only 41\" you've raised your kids. I'm mad, sad, and still living in denial. My daughter doesn't understand what's happening to Mommy. Living with cancer at any age is difficult, but before you say you understand how we're feeling \"Do you really\"?      ",
