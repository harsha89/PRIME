      "Content": "Jul 1, 2017 10:21AM TruffleShuffle wrote: Hello all, I do not carry the Brip1 mutation, but I did test positive for the NBN genetic mutation (which is high risk breast cancer, certain types of skin cancers, and possibly ovarian cancer-they're still studying the ovarian part). I also tested positive for the APC vus (variant of unknown significance) that's considered higher risk for some colon cancers and/polyps? Although I don't have the same genetic mutation that you all have, my heart does go out to you with all the uncertainty and anxiety that comes with testing positive for a genetic mutation that isn't as thoroughly studied as the BRCA genes. NeenQueen is absolutely right in that having a genetic counselor, and proper healthcare providers through all of this is key to a better decision making process. My doctor failed to put me in touch with a genetic counselor, so I was left to seek information on my own. I finally did speak to a counselor, but at that point I had all of my information pretty much down, and she is there when I need her. There is a lot to consider with these mutations. I tested positive a little over a year ago, decided to do something about it, slacked off with my decision & tried to put it out of my mind... that is, until my next mammogram. I'm one of those unfortunate ladies who gets the dreaded call backs, and \"diagnostic\" mammograms ordered. The sonograms. The orders for a biopsy, then canceled biopsy orders. Sent on my way with, \"we will keep an eye on these 'spots'\". As for myself and my genetic mutations, I'm going to have to just take a deep breath, sort through my emotions, and try to be as rational as I can about it. I have an extensive family history of breast and other types of cancer (but mostly breast) on my mother's and father's side- I have what doctors have deemed \"problematic breasts\", dense, fibrous, and chronically inflamed in some spots. I'm seriously considering a preventative double mastectomy with reconstruction. Yes, many people will think this is a drastic option. But I know myself, Ihave a decent understanding of my genetic mutation, I understand my own extensive family history of breast and hormonal cancers- I know what I can handle- and what I can not handle is lifelong mammograms, and sonograms, call backs, anxiety, waiting rooms, sleepless nights, biopsies... every six months... forever. You all are in my thoughts. I hope you find answers that give you peace. -C",
