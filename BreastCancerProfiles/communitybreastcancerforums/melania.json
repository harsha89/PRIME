I can walk and sit and read and type and etc  but i cant do things which needs to stretch your hands or ligt anything , i cant open the medicine bottles or water , anyway this too shall pass hopefully !! i was always thinking that i cant wear a bra and i will have big abnadages over my breast and all i need is a bagy shirt with buttons infront ! WRONG , cuz they gave ma a bra which looks like a sport bra but opens and closes in front and is so tight that if i open i can not close it again . The ps told me it should be tight and when u go home u can wear a sport bra. i think my surgeons did a great job, my breasts still look like my breasts ! maybe because i was a small chested girl , i was A cup and i have tissue expanders put at the time of mastectomy and will start the fills after radiation, but even now it looks better than my original breasts , the only thing missing is the nipples , I am happy with the look part so hopefully the path report will come out clear either. I have 2 questions: 1) I was  wondering since when did u start driving after surgery? Is this ok if someone else drives you to the shopping mall and u do some shopping but not for a long time? i need to buy something for my daughter . 2)its the 5th day after surgery and i am still taking vicodin and if i forget to take it on time i feel i'm gonna die , tha pain is killing when will the pain go away? thank you for everything love u all",

The right side which was my cancer and lymphies are more painful than the other side. Ladies can u tell me how many days did it take for pathology results to come back? Although i did chemo and there is no tumor left i am concerned , there might be residual cells or lymph nodes . My skin around the nipple had small frickles and i was worried that it might be skin involvement or mets , the surgeon says she doent think so but if anything shows that the margins are not clean she can take a ittle but more, when we do mastectomy is this still possible not to have clean margins??? May be this is the skin that she was talking about. I am a ittle bit scared!",

I got 2 more opinions and they all agreed by doing chemo before surgery u can see the respond of the tumor by shrinkage and plus u can start the chemo as soon as possible without waiting for recovery after surgery and by doing so u can stop it from spreading ASAP. But again there are cases that they prefer to do the surgery first . And there are lots and lots of survivors who did so .

I know the cancer does not know these things but I am really lost and needed more info to know where I will stand years after all these chemo surgey ras etc...",

Even though my tumor was 2.7 My onc not only ordered a pet scan at Dx but a whole body Cat scan, Bone scan and guess what ??? Brain MRI  to rule out the cancer is no where else . I was scared to death but it all happened in 2 days and i got all the result the same days and they were clear except the pet scan which showed 3 lymph nodes which at that time I jumped from the happiness because i was just praying its nowhere else except that area !!! LOL !",
