Now on my back so I can see what's going on. More uncomfortable than being \"in the hole\" (prone position). It was a loooong first boost. Oh the pain of circulation lost! But it passes, and I'm a litter closer to DONE. They drew all over my chest this time; lovely primitive art :) Fatigue is huge now, but counting my blessings that my skin is doing pretty good. Have bumps like mosquito bites & itching. Can't wait to get these tapes off my skin! But would trade all that for either enough sleep or enough coffee to rise above the fatigue. Soon..... Happy weekend everyone!",

The fatigue got worse to, but I think I am on the mend now. It's a good thing, because life has dealt other issues to deal with. Not much time to celebrate & recover from radiation. Moving on to helping other people with their problems. Gues that is progres.",

Yesterday was tough -- had dry run. Got nauseous all day. I think from the 40 minutes pressing on stenum & vagus nerve with my face stuck in a little hole. The on the belly position is good protection for my lungs, but a little hard to take for long periods. Treatments are much shorter, so today was better. Tomorrow they are going to put a little \"hot flash\" fan in tge hole so there is more air flow.",
