Best of luck, Lynne P.S. My onc said you can receive a higher dose on abraxane than paclitaxol, because abraxane is more tolerable- seems like a big plus when fighting liver mets!",

Had to decrease the dose and then quit because of hand-foot syndrome (which started very early for me,) but it made my liver mets disappear! I also had pretty bad fatigue with xeloda- the only other se I had.  It would get worse 2-3 days into the on cycle, and linger a few days after ending the cycle... still fatigued on the off days, but no where near as bad as during the on days.  So, whether the xeloda has an immune system effect or not, I could see the fatigue (or any other se) making recovering from a cold or infection seem to take longer than normal.  If you do have problems with fatigue, check to see if you can get a rx for a stimulant like ritalin or adderral- I found they helped.  Good luck to you all, Lynne",

I know I read somewhere in all the paperwork (maybe the informed consent?) that the goal of the study is \"treatment,\"and also that I get to continue to receive the drugs until disease progression, unacceptable se, or the drugs are no longer available. I am left wondering, after reading the article you linked to, does the proposed one year limit on testing in women with stage 4 mean I would be kicked out of the study after it had been in place for a year? I seem to remember reading somewhere that in Europe women w/ stage 4 are actively encouraged to do early phase trials, and it seems to help move research and testing along, compared w/ the US, where all sorts of obstacles are put in the way- needing insurance company permission, being disqualified for many studies if \"heavily pre-treated\" (wtf? how many people w/ stage 4 aren't?)  I'd really love to see that requirement thrown out of most clinical trials- it is a slap in the face to anyone stage 4 that makes it obvious that any \"cures\" coming down the line are not specifically intended for people w/ stage 4 bc. Since my last ct showed progression back in my liver after my third try with anti-hormonals, I knew the choice was chemo or nothing (bummer.)  Was set to try abraxane, but when told I qualified for this research study, I felt such hope!  Herceptin, a monoclonal antibody (like the study drug I am taking,) has greatly improved the lives of so many women... and I'm guessing the first women to benefit from it where those in the phase I/II trials.  So, I at least have hope that I might get in at the ground level for a great new treatment, and that means a lot to me... and it helps make up for being used essentially as a human guinea pig... and, someone has to be among the first to try it out!  I am sure my motivation is a lot higher than someone at an earlier stage- I never imagined myself in a phase 1 trial... until the last ct scan. I do agree with your concerns re the Komen foundation and have gotten the impression they do very little for those w/ stage 4... apparently they light luminary candles in our memory... yeah, thanks but no f-ing thanks.  I guess that's about as much in the picture as stage 4 gets w/ Komen (no, wait, I'll be really cynical- I think they also use us as a scare tactic to raise money.) Another complaint- the American Cancer Society's program where newly dx are paired with a \"survivor\" for support.... no, they did not have anyone with stage 4 I could speak with- talk about good intentions paving the road to hell!  Just like with everyone else, we seem to be an uncomfortable after thought. How about Komen taking care of any travel and other expenses associated with participating in a clinical trial?  And providing a real live human being to call persons just dx w/ bc to screen for appropriate trials, explain what is involved, and recommend clinical trials that might be of interest? Maybe they could use some of that money they're spending to sue other non-profits for having the nerve to use the color pink!  (again, wtf?) Clinicaltrials.gov lets you search by study sponsor, here's what I found for Komen: clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results...  Out of 23 studies (but only 10 actively recruiting) it seems a stretch to suggest any are \"cure\" oriented (not in my probable lifetime, anyway.)  On a fun note, I did hear of a group of metsters referring to themselves as \"stage 5- stayin' alive!\"  Wish I could give credit where due, but don't know the names.  Catchy, and oh so true! ",

After one day (two doses), my finger tips and toes became red - I was told I should have called at that point.  Took one more day of the initial dose, then went in later that morning and saw my onc, who said it was hand/foot syndrome and decreased my dosage to 1,500 mg twice daily and prescribed 200mg B6 daily. After one day on the lowered dose, I noticed a 2x3 inch area of small raised red dots (no pain or itching) on my left shin and called my onc's nurse, who said to come in.  A couple hours later, when I saw the nurse practitioner, the dots on my shin were an even brighter red and very visibly raised, the soles of my feet were dark mottled red, with mild edema in fingertips and feet along with sensitivity (but no pain of tingling.) The nurse practitioner, who has worked with bc patients for years, said it was definitely h/f, that she had never seen anything like the h/f reaction on my shin... and that I must be a \"slow metabolizer\" of xeloda.  She took photos of my shin and feet for my file, then brought in another person to confer with.  Both were quite surprised by how quickly this occurred.  After talking with my onc by phone, she told me to discontinue the xeloda for the rest of my \"on\" week, go ahead and take the \"off\" week, and then see my onc at the start of the second \"on\" week, when she would probably put me on a lower dose of xeloda. I was also told to limit my intake of folate, to discontinue my vitamin supplement, and avoid cereal and breads etc. fortified with folic acid... which is surprisingly (and depressingly) hard to do, being a vegetarian. Has anyone else had or heard of a similar experience, or heard anything about \"slow metabolizers\" of xeloda?  I looked at some research that suggests certain genetic variations affect how xeloda is metabolized, but have not yet found anything else.  I have had no other side effects from xeloda so far, and really hope I can tolerate this drug long term... my onc says she has patients who have been on it for years... oh how I hope I will be in that group, too!

There are only signs and trends. Emotionally, it is like riding a roller coaster blind-folded. The shock you are feeling is normal and will fade.  But it can return again in a heartbeat- it did for me when brain mets were accidently found on a ct of my neck. Was scheduled for 14 Tx's of whole brain radiation, at mind-blowing speed. But good news comes again! After my first cycle of abraxane, an enlarged lymph node shrank noticeably! And up into the sky I fly on my cancer rollercoaster!  But for how long....major scanxiety forecast near the end of the month- especially the day before my first ct since starting abraxane. March's ct was a mixed bag of regression and progression (oh, yeah, and brain mets.)  So while I hope both my liver and nodes show regression this time, and I am planning on good news, I know it might not be. Instead of riding higher on that emotional rollercoaster I may come screaming down... there's no way to know in advance. I think part of wanting to know what to expect comes from the intense desire to regain some sense (or illusion) of control-  wanting to \"plan\" your life, thinking we know what to expect... like we all did in our pre-stage 4 life. Maybe finding out I have brain mets just totally blew away any lingering illusions regarding how much \"control\" I have... and how much more dependent on others I am, and will be. I know this, feel this, on a fundamentally deeper level than before. I have tried to use this to deal emotionally with not knowing what to expect by focusing on what I can still do. Cancer is what it is. It will do what it will... and so will I! There's a fairly high statistical probablity this will kill me, sooner than later.  But, I'm used to being statistically abnormal... so, I'm gonna dig my heals in and hang on as long as I want to. And when it's time to go, I am only returning to where I came from. But got no plans for leavin anytime soon!   Too many things to still feel and do, see and hear, listen and say... Sorry if this is rambling... and hope it is some help.  This is my life- stage 5, staying alive  Lynne      ",

There is no indication I will receive the stated reimbursement for completing the survey, and as far as I can tell, the only purpose of the survey (which is solely a marketing survey) is to persuade people- especially those taking the survey- to sell them on pushing to add avastin (bevacizumab) to their treatment. It mentions unnamed studies which supposedly show great benefit from taking avastin... problem is, the \"benefit\" as best I can tell from my own research, is minimal in terms of overall survival; the SE were also very downplayed. And, avastin is very very expensive. My onc has already mentioned to me that although avastin seems to do what it is intended to do, there is no good proof that it offers much in the real world setting- the article below covers this topic: Hurdling the Challenges of Anti-angiogenic Therapy by Caroline Helwick Clinical Oncology News ISSUE: APRIL, 2010 | VOLUME: 05:04 http://www.clinicaloncology.com/index.asp?section_id=148&show=dept&issue_id=625&article_id=15024 I want to make clear, because I know there are people on this forum who have had good results with the chemo/avastin combo, that I don't mean to take anything away from their happiness. I truly and only wish them (and all of us) the best of luck... Oh how we all wish for a cure!   This is all directed solely towards the way in which this marketing \"interview\" is being conducted and promoted, and by what I read in the article below regarding the cost of tx with avastin.  The article is 4 years old, but it appears the only thing that has changed is the level of optimism regarding avastin's efficacy: A Cancer Drug Shows Promise, at a Price That Many Can't Pay New York Times 2/15/06 http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/15/business/15drug.html?_r=1 [Side rant:  especially irritating is that according to the NYT article, the cost of making the drug is a fraction of what Genentech/Roche sells it for; and, that initial pricing was based on the amount of the drug used by weight to treat colon cancer... BUT, the dose by weight used in bc tx is greater, and instead of charging a similar price per tx, the company continues to charge by weight.  Now, I have no problems with companies making a reasonable profit, but I think charging the equivalent of $100,000 per year for a treatment that has little proof it does much for most  people with bc in the real world is obscene!] Until I hear anything different, all I can say is please DON'T TAKE PART IN THIS! P.S. Oh yeah, and to Genentech/Roche (makers of Avastin / bevacizumab) and Synovate... my experience with this has resulted in the exact opposite of the intent of whoever came up with this piece of B.S. I now have absolutely nothing good to say about any of this!!!!! Log in to post a reply",

P.S. No offense to anyone making a different choice, but doesn't it seem that implants or prosthetics ultimately run counter to breast cancer \"awareness?\"",

I'll add just a little more here. I would really question the 2 week on and 1 off schedule- I think the research is pretty strong that the most benefit in terms of anti-tumor activity occurs within the first 7 days of the cycle, the extra days are thought to produce little benefit and make the side effects worse... it worked great for me, but I had to stop because of the hand-foot syndrome (hfs.).  If it works for you, I would view it as a long haul, do everything you can to keep the side effects from developing. HFS can start after your first dose, which happened to me, and it will get worse over time, but also went away quickly once I stopped taking xeloda.  Call your doc asap, you may be told to hold a dose or two, or decrease dosage. I know I felt the same kind of fear when I started that you mentioned, and for the same reason (I think we all go through that... anything that makes it all seem more real, or like another step down a dark and scary path.)  Putting that first pill in my mouth was so hard, but hearing the word \"regression\" for the first time since this all started shot me straight up to cloud nine! Hope all is going well for you! Lynne P.S. Forgot to mention I did also have problems with fatigue, it would start a couple days into the on cycle and last a couple into the off cycle (I was on the 7 day on/7 day off cycle.)  Was already taking ritalin for memory issues, after describing the fatigue to my psych he switched me to a higher dose of adderral for the bad fatigue days, and a smaller dose of adderral for the easier days- helped quite a bit.",

      "Content": "Jun 17, 2011 07:45AM - edited Jun 18, 2011 08:01AM by redskies Dear Deborah, I am so sorry to hear of your stage 4 diagnosis.  You are not over-reacting.  Its a different world, and the journey there is unimaginable by anyone who hasn't experienced it. I see a psychologist through my cancer center who only treats people with cancer, it has helped very much (its a new field called psycho-oncology.) On the good side, as my oncologist would say, you're \"young\" like me (though I understand feeling sooo aged by all of this) and you have what sounds like a \"low disease burden.\" as do I. Have you had a cat scan done since you started the faslodex?  You should probably be getting one cat scan every 2-3 months. You need some idea if the faslodex is working- I am ER+/PR- /her2 neg, and have been on faslodex double shots... slowed the progression but you can only go so long down that road.  Plus, the er/pr/her status can change when it returns as mets, and the only way to know is by biopsy... ask if one can be done (and press hard if the answer is no... unless none of nodes are accessible- and get a second opinion.)  Your treatment options will change if the er/pr/her status has changed, and this is not rare. If at all possible, get a second opinion asap from a different oncologist.  Some are very, very good when talking with their patients, others do a lousy job. Look around- you shouldn't have to pry info out of your oncologist!  Mine has the most wonderful smile, has an awesome nurse coordinator who calls back the same day with answers to questions or concerns I leave on her voice mail, and the  staff are friendly and happy too... and they all leave me feeling better!   I was diagnosed stage 4 based on the level of lymph nodes with cancer after surgery.  Wasted 4 months at the first place I was treated- substandard care in so many ways. Went for a second opinion at a large teaching and research hospital, and was knocked flat by the difference. The Dr. sat at eye level with me, and made me feel he had nothing else in the world to do at that time but talk with me and get to know me and  my story. However long it took.  Explained everything in depth, looked to see I understood, asked for questions from me...WOW! Think about getting SSDI if you can- it is automatic for breast cancer stage 4- the day you are diagnosed is the day you become eligible (for me it was the date of my biopsy.) They back date the 6 month (?) waiting period to that date too. After 2 years on SSDI you are automatically enrolled in Medicare.  You can't work and get SSDI, but you can make your job taking care of yourself (and helping your husband... he'll be in need of some support, understanding, and stress relief, too.) Most important though is to remember that each person's cancer is different and statistics about prognosis only apply at the group level (plus they are only describing the way in which a group responded overall at some time in the past.)  The only thing that matters is how your cancer responds to treatment. Best wishes and hopes for you, Lynne  P.S. It is true, it does get better...",

There is no indication I will receive the stated reimbursement for completing the survey, and as far as I can tell, the only purpose of the survey (which is solely a marketing survey) is to persuade people- especially those taking the survey- to sell them on pushing to add avastin (bevacizumab) to their treatment. It mentions unnamed studies which supposedly show great benefit from taking avastin... problem is, the \"benefit\" as best I can tell from my own research, is minimal in terms of overall survival; the SE were also very downplayed. And, avastin is very very expensive. My onc has already mentioned to me that although avastin seems to do what it is intended to do, there is no good proof that it offers much in the real world setting- the article below covers this topic: Hurdling the Challenges of Anti-angiogenic Therapy by Caroline Helwick Clinical Oncology News ISSUE: APRIL, 2010 | VOLUME: 05:04 http://www.clinicaloncology.com/index.asp?section_id=148&show=dept&issue_id=625&article_id=15024 I want to make clear, because I know there are people on this forum who have had good results with the chemo/avastin combo, that I don't mean to take anything away from their happiness.
