I first started noticing it about 2 years ago because my breast hurt, almost like am ache that spread to my arm pit. My areola was super sensitive to touch in one spot that it felt almost like burning. My breast didn't look any different (it still doesnt) but the only way i can explain the sensation is that I was very aware of my left breast. It no longer just felt like a part of my body, almost like how you don't notice your nose. Anyways, I took this to my gp who sent me to have an ultrasound. It ended up being negative (yay!), so I thought nothing of it. Fast forward to this week. I had to make doctors appointnebt because I havent been feeling well. I also noticed that the discharge is now spontaneous and also has a clear discharge in another duct. My doctor was very nice and want a to examine me more. The reason why I am concerned is because breast cancer runs in my family, and my mum was diagnosed with it 5 years ago. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this? Im looking forwards to your replies! Log in to post a reply",
