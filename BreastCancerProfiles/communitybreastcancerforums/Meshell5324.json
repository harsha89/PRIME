      "Content": "Meshell5324 wrote: Hi, Sorry this is kinda long. I had a painful lump that I thought was a cyst. My regular primary doctor retired 2 yrs ago. I saw her replacement last year but I really wasn't completely happy with her. When I found the lump I just didn't want to see her and decided to try my friends primary doctor who she highly recommended. I really liked her and she was spot on with her concerns regarding my lump. She scheduled a mammogram and ultrasound for Tues the 5th in the morning and an appointment for a BS that same day to do a core needle biopsy. I did look up the BS and his practice specialized in breast care only and he had excellent reviews. I was feeling scared but really comfortable knowing that if/when it came back as cancer I would have a really good surgeon who specialized in breast cancer. Ok here's where it gets weird. I'm at the hospital breast care center, I've had my 3D diagnostic mammogram and I've just finished my ultrasound. The technician leaves to go speak to the radiologist who was reading the test results. When she comes back she brings the radiologist with her. He says \"that really needs a biopsy.\" I explain that I have an appointment that evening with Dr .... and he was going to do the biopsy. His response \"Dr .... is an excellent surgeon but do to unforeseen circumstances his office is closed indefinitely\" OK WHAT! But \"I can do the biopsy right now\" OK ... yes please do. So, Thursday the 7th my new primary Dr calls me with the news that it is Cancer she says, \"I don't know you that well but if it was me I'd want that out \" and \"I was able to find you a new Surgeon who can see you tomorrow.\" Ok, since the original guy is out I met with the new Dr. He is a general surgeon who specializes in vascular surgery. He recommended neoadjunctive chemo because of the tumor size and gave me a referral to an oncologist who I will see Tues. Now I have all this time to think over the weekend and I'm thinking I really need a BS who specializes in breast cancer. I only met with the surgeon for all of 15 mins. He read me my pathology report, double checked my lymph nodes weren't swollen and said shrink the tumor and do a lumpectomy. It sounded good to me at the time. So after all that rambling on ... has anyone not used a BS who specializes in just breast cancer... is the oncologist more important? I have way to much time to think .....

It's a lot to take in but this is a wonderful place to ask questions and read articles. I've learned a lot in less than a week. It does help to bring someone with you to your appointments. They can take notes and provide moral support. Good luck on Friday! Meshell",

It was nice to wake up with both breast there. It doesn\u2019t feel foreign and matches well in shape and size to my non cancer breast. I had full range of arm motion and didn\u2019t loose any arm strength. I was numb on the reconstructed side for about 2 weeks but that has gone away completely (weird sensations while nerves are reconnecting). I agree with MT women, you need to have a consult with a PS. They can give you all kinds of options. Best wishes. ",
