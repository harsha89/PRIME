I didn't really want rads if it wasn't necessary as there are some bad SEs and it does affect they type of recon one can get post rad. I pushed until I had my case heard by the tumor board at the local cancer center. Everyone present felt that rads would definitely increase my lifespan and chances for preventing reoccurance. So, I go on the 23rd of this month for my simulation. I am NOT real happy about this, but I am willing to do it if it will give me many more years of healthy lifespan.  I did specifically ask my med onc about SEs...and how many patients he has seen with 2ndary cancers from rads. He said he has only seen 1 pt develop this type of 2ndary cancer from rads. i guess it's not all that common, but the thought of getting cancer from treating cancer seems a little stupid to me. I've already increased my risk of getting leukemia because I had 4 rounds of Adriamycin....GAWD!!! enough already!!! I will be interested in following this thread to see how many gals chime in on the subject.",

One of my nursing professors at Creighton is a nurse and a lawyer. She also became my advisor at the end of the program and was a wealth of knowledge. Now that I've decided to go on with rads I am ok with it. I will deal with it as well as I  have dealt with all the other crud I have been through since being diagnosed.

Fortunately I tested negative for this genetic disease. Generally there is a strong family history of abdominal cancers that lead you to get tested. Just my 2 cents.. hope it helps someone.",

GET TESTED if you have any family history of abd cancers. I am totally disappointed that mammos don't pick up the lobular ca. I also think that our self breast exam education doesn't really teach how to find the lobular ca. I was always taught to feel for a \"lump\"....not a thicker feeling area. I have since told all my friends what my cancer felt like and they were all shocked to hear it wasn't a lump. I say... tell everyone who will listen!! ",

I am just glad this part of my treatment is over. My surgeon is going to present my case to the Tumor Board....that way we can get a consensus on whether or not I need radiation therapy.

The trouble with ILC is that it doesn't grow as a mass, but rather as thread like projections..single file cells in a line. For this reason, and at the recommendation of my surgical oncologist, I had a mastectomy rather than a lumpectomy. I had an MRI to 'size' my cancer prior to surgery. My original core biopsy showed two tumors less than 1 cm each....the MRI showed a 7 cm tumor!! It also showed smaller areas...that after chemo were unchanged. Turned out they were LCIS...but it wasn't until I had the mastectomy that they discovered the LCIS. To clarify.. I had neoadjuvant chemo. Now, I am comfortable with my decision to have the mastectomy...even though the chemo made my tumor in my breast completely disappear, and I knew this before hand because I had an MRI after finishing my chemo.  Regarding ultrasound.. I had one initially and the tech found an area that the radiologist confirmed was questionable. The US guided biopsy was scheduled, I returned for my appt, the tech could NOT find the questionable area, I was asked to return so the original tech and original radiologist could find the area to biopsy, I did, it was located and biopsied, it was cancer...nuff said. Clearly US depends on the knowledge and expertise of the tech!!  Another issue.. ILC doesn't generally show up on mammogram....go figure! It's the sneaky breast cancer!! Stacy ",

Perhaps a visit to planned parenthood, or a discussion about teen pregnancy might get him thinking. Are these young girls on birth control?? Are they using condoms?? So much he needs to learn. Is he ready to be a father? Could he support a baby for the next 18 years?? All questions he should be thinking about. You could always do what I did to my husband...take him to the doctor for STD testing. The swab up the urethra was quite the incentive to NOT have unprotected sex. Quite painful I hear.  With regards to the girls mothers...remind them that it takes 2. He isn't forcing himself on these girls. They are more than willing.

My PS wanted to install  a set of 900's. I'm thinking they'd be HUGE!! Good that I've decided to wait on the recon or I might have had to quit my job at the hospital and gone to work for Hugh.  LOL I have good news on the dating front....this guy I started seeing says he's an a@@ man, and that he really isn't bothered by the missing girl. PHEW!!!  My not having much hair isn't an issue either...seems the older guys are a bit more mature and less bothered by the 'little things'. Hope everyone's Easter was delicious!! Stacy ",

It has to be so disappointing to go through this after all you have already been through. grrr.  Don't you just wish the sun would shine on you just one day? That's how I feel sometime...just one day of sunshine please!!  Speaking of the uncomfortable hospital bed... you could try complaining about it. I work in a hospital and know that most have several versions of bed available. Some are much more comfortable than others. If your tailbone area is feeling bruised from sitting in that hard bed, make sure you are getting up to the chair several times a day. Also, make sure you are getting enough protein. They should have a medical dietician available to see  you. She can get you some tasty supplements that are rich in healing protein. All you need to do is ask...ask....ask! Stacy ",

I am starting to gently massage lotion in that area while i do that skin/scar massage like my PT/OT taught me to do. It's slow going, but if this is my new normal then I must learn to deal with it.

Nothing funny about it, it's just an amputation I had to have to save my life. ",

I have been unable to work more than an occasional 8 hr shift here or there since the chemo always had my white count in the neutropenic range. Fortunately I have finished chemo and my immune system is fully functioning again!! I had my left mx on feb 25 and hope to go back to work next week...3 shifts, 8 hrs each. Normally we do the 12 hrs shifts on my floor, but since I have to do rads I won't be able to, gotta find time each day to get my daily dose of radiation.. grr.  The biggest problem is that on my floor the RNs do total patient care...we have no CNAs to help out. How is that going to work now that I am not supposed to lift, push, or pull with my left arm? ",

I had AC x 4, weekly taxol x5, then taxotere x 2. I must say that I thought the taxotere was the worst. First of all it's 10 x's the cost of taxol...which seems odd to me. Secondly, it was the only med that i took that caused horrible mouth sores. Luckily you can get \"magic mouthwash\" from your doc that will numb your mouth enough to eat a meal of soft bland food. Ladyjane, make sure to tell your doc about the rashy redness...some people are allergic to the packaging of taxotere and would be better off using taxol. I had a friend who suffered that SE and her doc wouldn't use taxotere anymore. Just remember it will soon be over...you can do it!! You will be surprised how soon after finishing that you start feeling so much better. Stacy ",

So, finished up with 2 large doses of taxotere without too  many awful side effectes. At any rate, My MRI yesterday showed no evidence of cancer in my breast or nodes. Initiallly my tumor showed 7cm x 3 cm with one node enlarged.  I am just thrilled with this news and will be proceeding with a double mast at the end of this month. I am also starting my tamoxifen today! ",

I felt that the AC regime was more do-able because they have meds to alleviate the side effects, mainly nausea. With the taxotere, the only thing they can give  you is a pain pill. That won't stop your nails from hurting, turning black, and falling off. I kept my nails cut very very short so they wouldn't get snagged on stuff. That helped a bunch. It'll be over with before you know it.. and you will feel better.. I promise!!   Stacy ",
