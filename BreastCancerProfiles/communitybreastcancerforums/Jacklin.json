All my shirts hurt when they touch the skin so I'm wearing a very loose cotton shirt and a hat when I go outside.

New-girl, I was told at rads #1 to put cream on that part of my back, multiple times every day so help the skin heal there. I was also told it is the exit area for the sub-clavicular axilla radiation The only cream I'm allowed to use is Lubriderm. If the skin breaks, the centre indicated they'll provide a prescription cream. I have been absolutely wiped out since rads started, right from rads #1 despite being told this wouldn't happen before rads #10. Has anyone else experienced this? I feel like I'm losing my mind....

Carlsoda, not sure I can say surgery was the easy part, I'm still very sore, especially around the outer edges of what used to be my breasts. It almost feels like there's a fire going on in there. There's no signs of infection, and I've just finished 2 weeks of Keflex for an anaerobic skin infection just under the incision site. Like you', I'm tired of going to the hospital and even more tired of being poked. This leads to another question, did you find that you became more sensitive to needles during treatment? Here's hoping everyone has an excellent day today. Stay dry if you're in Ontario!!",

She then re-booked for 2 weeks later and at that time I learned about the breathing technique to use (they first measure my lung volume a few times, then take 80% of that to use for treatment. When I inhale, I can do so to 80% maximum volume and then the machine doesn't allow me to take a deeper breath. Since my nose is plugged, I can't breathe in through my nose either. This process pushes the heart farther away from the radiation beam). Like Ingerp, I was on my back the whole time, the CT scanner was in the same room as where the measurements were taken. The measuring process took about 30 minutes. I also went to 'radiation school' where they make sure I know what to expect, who to call if there are issues, what to use/ not use, etc. I received 4 pinprick tattoos, only the last one, closest to the breastbone hurt the most, but it was only momentary. My kids had fun learning that Mom had 4 tattoos before they had any. The whole appointment took less than 90 minutes.",

I am to continue using saline soaks and then use flammazine of the blistering 3 times a day. I can also use Lubriderm on the other radiated skin (she suggested keeping it in the fridge, the cold cream feels so good) and also Pro Shield Plus when I'm wearing a shirt. Since it's only my hubby and I at home, I spend most of the time after rads without a shirt on, so much easier on the skin and the cool breeze either from the fan or the air outside feels good.

Given that, I can see why your BS is suggesting a SLNB. Once your breast has been removed, if cancer is suspected in the future, they can't do a SLNB anymore, only an ALND which is much more invasive. I don't have the option of a SLNB because the cancer was found in my lymph system already, so it's ALND for me. All the best, Jacklin",

My BMX is almost a week after yours, the 26th, but I like your idea of enjoying a long and healthy future. This surgery, while emotionally difficult, will get the cancer out of your body. Someone mentioned that the difficult part of pre-surgery is the emotional piece and I have also found that. I had a meltdown a few weeks ago, very teary, but now I'm resolved, ready to do it, so let's get it done! You have a great attitude towards it and that encourages me as well, so thank you for that. I won't be able to have reconstruction now, or TE's placed as I still have radiation to go, but that's ok for now. Let's just get it out of my body!! Have a great day, Jacklin",

Now, I know the answer. Thank you for sharing your experience, sorry that you had to experience it in the first place. Wow, 4 EMT's, we only get 2 here. And one of them checking out your guinea pig, seriously! Glad you are ok now.",

Your head is probably spinning now, thinking and fearing the worst. Know that there are many wonderful people here who will support you in any way possible. Can you bring someone with you to the doctor's tomorrow? If not, what about taping the conversation - I found that really useful because I could listen to what the oncologist/doctors say after you leave because you can't possible take it all in. Don't forget to breathe, I know that sounds silly, but honestly, many of us forget to take deep breaths in and out. Know that we're here to support you, ok? All the best tomorrow and if you have any questions, ask them here. Jacklin",

You've had a lot of your plate this last week with your husband breaking his leg. You sound like a loving wife and mother, know that your Mom will do her very best while she's with you - I am so glad that she can be there for you. As many others have said, take those deep breaths, especially when you get the pathology report this afternoon. I'll be thinking of you, lots. Gentle hugs for you.

I also wish you the same, and let us all be done with the cancer treatment soon with NED for everyone, wouldn't that be awesome? I think of you many times every day, we're both waiting for our surgeries and you're right, the waiting game is hard. I try to keep my days filled/busy so that I don't watch the calendar and go \"only x day before my surgery\". I do find myself checking the girls in the mirror, wondering what it's going to look like post-surgery, but rather than get sad, I keep reminding myself that the cancer will be out of my body. Last night I attended a Breast Reconstruction seminar in a city close by and I got to meet the PS's who do the reconstruction surgeries and they were wonderful, so encouraging that it really helped me realize that I can feel more 'normal for me' again after treatment is done. I am not comfortable with the idea of prostheses forever, it's just not me. My husband doesn't understand why I'm thinking of reconstruction but I told him that I'm doing it for me and nobody else. I need to have it done, period. I don't want to look in the mirror every day and be reminded of the BC that is going to be a part of my past, hopefully soon. Sorry for babbling here girls. Have a good night everyone.",

I will be having surgery next week followed by radiation. I won't know the exact result of the chemo until the pathology report is ready. things seem to move much slower here in Canada, I have to wait 2 - 3 weeks to get those results. Waiting is very difficult - get as much information as you can from the right sources, this forum has been wonderfully supportive and a wealth of information. We found it was very helpful to take a tape recorder into our meetings so that we didn't have to take notes and could listen to what was said as many times as we needed to. Wishing you all the best and good for you for finding us and for posting. She is a blessed woman to have you as her husband.",

I also developed blood clots after my port was placed. I was told that chemo 'makes you blood more sticky, so you're more likely to develop blood clots\". I've been on Lovenox daily injections for the last 5 months with 1 more month to go. After 6 months, I stop taking the injections, that will also be 4 months after finishing chemo. Like Angtee says, being on blood thinners is scary (I've learned to give myself the daily belly injections now and it doesn't bother me any more), but having a blood clot move is scarier and can be fatal. While I'm not a doctor, I think that 2 months isn't enough time for the clots to dissolve and so having pain is to be expected, unfortunately. Wishing you all the best.",
