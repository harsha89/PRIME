I have found some similar situations started but never followed up on with the final outcome. I'm assuming that's because it was a positive outcome. I have always had cysts in my right breast but they were all benign and didn't need any follow up. They were only identified by an US and always resolved themselves. The end of July I had my annual mammogram and received a clean bill of health. The beginning of September, Labor Day week-end to be exact, I noticed a lump in my left nipple. The lump was so large that my nipple was tilting towards the left. That night I had a clear watery discharge from the nipple and the size of the lump reduced. Over the next couple of weeks the lump would increase in size but then fluid would discharge (from a single duct) and the lump would go down. After several weeks I finally went to my GP and was sent to a surgeon. The surgeon requested an US. The US report stated: Gray scale sonography of the retroareolar left breast was performed in multiple projections using real time imaging. Located in the area of palpable abnormality, within the nipple, there is an anechoic mass which measures 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. This is connected to a minimally dilated segment of duct. Within the segment of minimally dilated duct, there are intraductal echoes without internal vascularity, possible debris. However, a fixed filling defect obscured by the cannot be entirely excluded on this examination. At the 5 o'clock position, in a periareolar location, there is a well-defined hypoechoic nodule which measures 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. IMPRESSION: 1. There is a 7 mm dilated segment of duct located in the nipple at the site of palpable abnormality, connected to a less dilated segment of duct containing internal echoes. This most likely represents a dilated ampulla or distal segment of duct but this area, including the intraductal echoes, should be reevaluated with repeat ultrasound in 6 months to ensure stability. 2. Probably benign hypoechoic nodule at the 5 o'clock position which also should be further evaluated with repeat ultrasound in 6 months. 3. If there is continuing clinical concern, or if the nipple discharge becomes bloody, further evaluation with MRI would be of benefit. ASSESSMENT: BiRad:3 - Probably Benign Recommendation: Clinical management. Ultrasound of the left breast in 6 months. I meet with the surgeon again a few days later and he recommended a ductal excision. He then proceeded to mention all the risks associated with the surgery. He mentioned that the nipple could die off due to the loss of blood flow. That was enough to scare me to put a hold on everything. I asked him if there was a chance that the discharge would stop on its own and he said probably not but we could wait a few weeks and follow up in November. My question is, has anyone else had a similar situation and did the discharge go away by itself? Thank you in advance for all insight. Sorry for the long story\u2026. Log in to post a reply",

Initially I thought this was just another cyst,but I believed once a cyst is drained it doesn't come back immediately. This lump can be expressed and almost immediately fills back up again. I'm just not sure where all that fluid is coming from. Since they did find a dilated duct with intraductal echoes on the US my doctor doesn't think that it will resolve itself and that's why he recommended the ductal excision. Initially I thought that was a great idea since this would put my mind at ease. I figured if there was anything within the duct that isn't supposed to be there we could have it evaluated and hopefully find it benign. But then he mentioned the risks associated with the surgery. Very scary..... and now I'm questioning whether this may go away or am I just pushing of the inevitable. My other option is waiting six months and getting another US. My fear is that the discharge will continue for the next 6 months. It's been happening on a daily basis since Labor Day :(",
