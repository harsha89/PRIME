All really is very complex and I bow to all who go through the torture (too strong a word?) in the infusion rooms. I found here, a group, \"chatters\" who well understand the details. I hesitate, now, to come down hard on the usually privately-owned infusion centers. Excellent nurses. Question the center owners. Got stuck on this upon learning what the Pres of the ACS reaps each year. Warmest to all. Thank you for the replies, and to those who celebrate, A Happy Easter! Wayne",

Appreciate those who have put up with me and my posts, and have responded accordingly. BTW, a leading oncologist here in Florida acknowledged that targeted chemo - in this case for MBC - will never work 'til the related stem cell is destroyed. Are you prepared to research this statement and pass is on to your followers? Why are so many itching to travel down the yellow brick road? (where the Wizard is pulling the cancer chemo strings).

Since there is zero chemo out there, all targeted, that will kill the tumors, why devasate your bodies and minds? Hopes that one will work? Clinically, none will. Oncologists worth their salt will tell you that until the related stem cell is destroyed, targeting chemos do nothing. I am not against chemo as such, but for MBC patients, yes, you are destroying what there is left. Your call, so to speak. To DarkestB4da, you are not too outspoken.

We planned a long overdue vacation, and had plans/tickets in place to go to costa Rica for two weeks. A quick visit to our respective doctors, a med check, Suzanne quivckly learned that she had breast cancer. Diagnosis said it already was a Stagew IV. Surprise since Suzanne had regular mamograms at site in Princeton, NJ. No trip to CR, rather a modified mastectomy on Thanksgiving Day. Chemo and all of that at hackensack Med Ctr. Then remission for 13 years. Moved to Sarasota, FL June 1998. Blood work said all was fine. . .this went on for a few years. Cut to the chase: found in the bones, on the liver and a lung about 5 years ago. Aggressive chemo, etc. Finally, here is my point: since there is no cure for MBC,why are so many puting up with (useless) chemo? I do not wish/want to sound insensitive; however, with all of the slash 'n burn side effects, all totally, chemo that is totally worthless (know that word will creat havoc), why not enjoy life, what God has given and bypass all the h--- of chemo? I talked to a receptionist and a nurse or two at an infusion center in Florida. \"Most\" of those in what i have come to call drip-by-drip chairs were MBC patients! Why? Given that one, the trade, knows there is no cure, why take on the h--- of chemo side effects? With Respect, Wayne 3-27-13 Sarasota, FL",

The cancer industry - for those diagnosed with MBC - read that again, is running with a wondering ship containing a fruitless cargo. Newly diagnosed - MBC - are in a quandry, face a difficult decision. Chemo WILL do harm to your mind - the art of remembering things, verbalizing thoughts and so forth. Frankly, from what I have read, (some-many?) doctors may be telling the truth; however, patients continue to be in a hope mode. I realize how what I offer above might/will be accepted. For those facing MBC, enjoy what life God offers you. Sans chemo, you will think more clearly. And NO ONE will tell you that you will (might) live longer.
