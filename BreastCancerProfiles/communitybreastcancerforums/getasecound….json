Its just easier for them to use the clips and yes create future surgerys for them.The spot that is getting irritated will never heal properly.I have had 21 lymph nodes removed so I have 21 clips left in.He also did a nonvasive on breast and clips have been left there also.I can not sleep on that side either as well as swelling in arm probably from clips irritating inside causing infection and draining into arm.It hurts like hell I can not sleep at night either.Its been 10 mons already and is getting worse.I had to find my own therapist and he will get me a compression sleeve finaly.I asked doc about getting a mas..just to get rid of this surgeons mess he did...I wish I would have gotten a second opinion first before letting this newbee cut me up :(",
