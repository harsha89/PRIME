What I can tell you is Hair Extensions after Chemo DOES NOT damage your re-growing hair and these extensions can be applied to as little as 1 inch of new growth. Our Hair Recovery Treatment Center is located in Los Angeles and we work exclusively with Pink Lotus, Cedar-Sinai Medical Center and UCLA Cancer Division, and recently have partnered with a Dermatologist who works exclusively with Cancer Skin and Hair Recovery. We are reputable here in California and not only do we \"just\" apply extensions to this new fragile re-growing hair we customize individual treatments plans to help strengthen the hair while monitoring the new growth throughout your time wearing the extensions each session is documented. We offer a 360 doctor supervised hair recovery program with proven results. Be aware of people who just apply extensions with no medial background or aftercare to offer ( unfortunately metoo14 has experience the latter). For more information or if you have any additional questions please visit us at hairwithacause or email us at info at hair with a cause dot com",
