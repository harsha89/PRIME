I had so much joint pain for three days after that it was awful.  And I can only take Tylenol, because I'm on blood thinners for A-fib.  Not much relief there.  Second chemo, my herceptin was cut in half, and I'll know tomorrow after the steroids are out of my system completely, if the pain is back or not.  Discussed with my oncologist yesterday and he thinks it was a combination of the Kytril (which he eliminated) and the herceptin.  I was able to work anyways on Monday (work is a great distraction from discomfort most of the time) so if I can forge ahead, I'm not going to let it slow me down. This whole cancer thing is forcing me to be more aware of how my body reacts to everything.  ",
