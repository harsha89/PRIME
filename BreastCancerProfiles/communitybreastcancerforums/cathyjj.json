I had my excisional biopsie a week ago and mine came out benign......................I had researched the internet on mucin and was terrified with the results I found. So, try not to research it to much because it causes fear. Put your Trust in God and he will help you. Its hard I know I had to wait 5 weeks to get through it all. In my prayers.Â ",
