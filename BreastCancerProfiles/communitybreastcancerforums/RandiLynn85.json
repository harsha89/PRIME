So, my question is first of all, could these be lymph nodes? I know they are everywhere in your body, but can they be palpable in the chest area?  Is there any other type of lumps like I describe that could be found in this area other than lymph nodes? I have read a little about Rotter's nodes, but I see that they are mostly affected when you have recurrent BC, and I have never had BC or cancer of any kind. My next question is, has anyone reading this ever had a large lump in this area and had it not be BC related? Can it be muscle related even if there isn't pain associated in the area?   I do work out, but after I found the lump I stopped working out for a week to see if it was just my muscle, but there was no change.  I do notice that it puffs out more after working out, so I assume it's on my pec muscle, whatever it is. I am a smoker, for the past 11 years :( and I am now in the process of quitting, as I am very scared. Can someone please give me some insight.  Is it normal for lymph nodes to swell this big when you have cancer or do they get bigger or stay relatively small?  I know that everyone is different, but I need some opinions.  I don't want to be worried about nothing or look like an idiot when I see my Dr. in a couple weeks.
