Thank you for your support and I am so glad I had this site to help me through this time. You all are very courageous and I wish you all nothing but the best. I will be thinking of you all and praying for you all as well.",

Both diagnostic mammo and U.S showed normal breast tissue and a total of 3 radiologists reviewed my films to confirm it was done correctly and it's normal tissue. However, I'm paranoid and sought a surgeon for a second opinion since it feels like a marble by my nipple. She was very blunt in saying of course it could be cancer, it may not be but it could be. Which made me sick to my stomach. She advised a FNA which is what I'm doing Friday, she also is not numbing the area since its close to the surface. I have a bad anxiety disorder and I'm terrified, making myself sick. I'm scared that I can feel this lump and what if it is cancer. But how could it be missed on a digital diagnostic mammo and U.S. With three radiologists confirming its normal breast tissue. How would normal tissue feel like a marble??? Please support... I'm a new mom living far from family and I'm scared sick Log in to post a reply",

I've never had fear like this or felt lumps of any kind anywhere. I wasn't expecting the BS to be so blunt and rough about the chance of it being something to worry about I guess! Especially because of my clear films",
