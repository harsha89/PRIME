      "Content": "Apr 22, 2008 10:30AM - edited Apr 26, 2008 02:55PM by Kim32 I have not been diagnosed with cancer.  I have not had a biopsy on the lump yet so that is probably why they aren't doing a SNB, since my lumpectomy is to test the entire lump for cancer.  I don't want to do any needle biopsy since I just want the whole thing removed.   One more thing I have to ask you ladies:  How many of you underwent an MRI prior to having a lumpectomy done?  My surgeon said he would write me an order for one if I wanted one, but he said he felt comfortable doing the lumpectomy without one, and that MRI's can produce a lot of false positives.  My mammogram and ultrasound were both negative and my left breast is a little thicker and more tender than my right and the lump can be clearly felt.  I guess I am just concerned of the possibility that there might be more going on in the breast than that lump, but i'm not sure how common that is.  I am 32 years old, and a little nervous about having an MRI done, but I also want to do what's best for me. ",
