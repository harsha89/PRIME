The ridge also couldn't be felt by my family dr. Or any of the other 4 people who've felt it unless I had my arm raised, but the surgeon could feel it even when I was lying down, which leads me to believe it has grown slightly in the past 3 months. I'm sick of hearing its nothing because I'm not high risk....I want to be given the same care as someone who is and not dismissed because I'm \"too young\", as we all know cancer doesn't discriminate.  Can the surgeon tell just by touch?  I thought any bump/lump/thickening/ridge that was cause enough to be sent for imaging and an appointment with the surgeon should be biopsied?  I could be wrong, but I feel that they would have used more care had I been a bit older and biopsied it.  I'm happy they booked me in for follow up in 3 months time, but concerned as I've already been going through tests, appointments and waits for 3 months already.  I'm stressed and gained 8 lbs since this began (stress eater).  I want to move on.
