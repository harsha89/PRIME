    "Content": "Smilingcrafter wrote: My Mom had a mastectomy in March and a implant placed at the same time.  In July she had to go back in and have the implant pulled out due to infection.  Then in Sept. she had to go back in for the doctor to remove scar tissue that was causing the wound not to close and heal.  Last week the doctor had to place the drain tube back in the breast and place several more stitches in the wound to try to close it.  The doctor says there is just very poor wound healing going on.  The doctor says he feels like the culprit is the lasting effects of the chemo.  Mom finished her chemo around September 4th.  We are at a loss of what we should do and feel helpless.  Has anyone else had the problem of not healing from the surgery?  A problem of a lot of draining?  Mom also complains of a sharp pain where her breast was almost to her back.  The doctor says he could not see anything there that would cause that problem.  Anyone that has had any of these problems I would love for you to share your experience.  Thanks, A very worried daughter Log in to post a reply",
