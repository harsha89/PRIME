My Bilateral Mast was less than 3 mos ago, I'm undergoing chemo currently and won't have any Rads till Nov. No reconstruction plans. I live in the hottest of southern climates and, at least when I had energy, used to exercise in the heat a lot. I'm very familiar with perspiration! I was recently fitted at a mastectomy shop close to me with the Amoena Energy Lite breast forms I LOVE them!!! They are amazing in the way they minimize, or in my case seem to eliminate perspiration in the chest and scar areas. I recently went for a walk where I was just dripping - my face, my neck, head, etc., and the area beneath and around my bra with the Energy Lites was dry. Granted, I use them in an Amoena Performance Mastectomy Bra that wicks away moisture from the body. I think the combination of the Energy Lites and a bra with fabric and pockets that wick away moisture (NOT cotton-that always stays damp with sweat and bacteria) is really important. I also have the TLC size 5 microbead forms and I did an interesting experiment yesterday. I wore the TLC microbead forms in the Amoena Performance Bra for a few hours in the heat and humidity, then I switched to the Amoena Energy Lite size 5s in the same bra. The TLC microbead forms were at least 2X to 3X as hot as the same bra with the silicone Amoena Energy Lites. I was really surprised. It must have to do with the fabric and the hotness of the microbeads next to the skin in the TLC forms. I didn't perspire excessively with the microbeads in the Performance Bra as I think that bra still wicked away the moisture, but I was completely dry with the Amoena Energy Lites in the same bra and it felt so much cooler than the microbead forms.  Now, all isn't perfect yet, but I'm working on it. The Amoena Performance Mastectomy Bra is extremely comfortable and supports the prothesis well, but since I have no more cleavage from the bilateral it has a piece that comes up high in the front that chaffed me a little on my sternum, while exercising, when it was new. I hope I have softened it enough with washings, but I will probably have to find another wicking mastectomy sports bra that is cut different in front? And the Amoena Energy Lites, size 5 have a little weight to them. I haven't found this a problem while exercising or wearing in general, but I have considered going down to the size 4 Energy Lites, the shop is ordering those for me to consider also? Background: I was a 32DD before the bilateral so lots of tissue and weight was removed from my small rib cage frame. At 8oz each I don't find the Amoena Energy Lites size 5s very heavy (compared to where I came from) but, the size 4s will save me roughly 3.4 oz for the pair total (1.7oz ea), so that might be significant for comfort, and it might not? I'm not sure, I'll have to see. The Amoena Energy Lite size 5s are a nice size, much smaller than I was, but nice. The Amoena 4s will be really small, compared to what I'm used to, but might be more comfortable? It doesn't really matter how small I am as all my clothes are hanging off of me from surgery and chemo weight loss anyway, and I wasn't heavy to begin with - aaargh... I will just see which are more comfortable the size 5 Energy Lites (which I have now and I really like) or the size 4s that I will compare soon. Regardless, the Amoena Energy Lites seriously rock! (No, I am not affiliated with Amoena, I just like these prosthetics). Does anyone know of a good sports mastectomy bra with wicking fabric that might be cut differently in front than the Amoena Performance Bra? Maybe it won't contact my sternum as much? I have also been using \"Body Glide\" anti-chafing stick which has helped a lot, but I still think I might need a different mastectomy sports bra. Thx! ",

      "Content": "Aug 3, 2010 08:58PM - edited Aug 3, 2010 09:04PM by watergal Yes, Barbara. The Amoena Performance Sports Mastectomy Bra 2658 totally handles the sweat problem with me. My Amoena Energy Lite forms and the pockets in that bra are always dry, even in our record heat and humidity. It is such a comfortable bra, it is just that one little piece - just the top of if in front - that can contact my sternum. I haven't had problems with chafing lately, so maybe it softened up? If so that will be my bra of choice for the silicone Energy Lites. I tried something else yesterday which will confirm your suspicion that a bra with good wicking properties will take care of sweating with silicone forms. I have a cotton pocketed bra that I got, early on, from The American Cancer Society. I wore it yesterday during 5 hours in 93 degree heat with 90% humidity. The pockets of the cotton bra with the Amoena Energy Lites in them were half damp. Still not bad for 5 hours in the oppressive heat, but I wore the Amoena Performance Bra in the same conditions with the Energy Lites and the pockets were totally dry when I took it off. It was also one of the coolest and driest parts of my body. I think I'm going to try the Anita Care Irina Mastectomy Sports Bra 5321 next and hopefully the top of the front material will be softer of my sternum. By the way, both bras are recommended for lymphedema - which I have the early stage of. I can concur the Amoena Performance Bra doesn't make me swell like some other mastectomy bras do. It is cool, comfortable (except for the top of the sternum piece) and not tight at all. Both these bras are back closing. I too, do not like front closing bras. So from what I've discovered it really depends greatly on the bra worn in the heat and how well it draws perspiration away from the body. Of course, I think the Energy Lite forms help too, because even when I wore then with a cotton-pocketed bra the sweating wasn't bad. I also like that the Amoena Energy Lite forms are so easy to clean, dry instantly with a towel, and are so sanitary. I do not like material or pads of sweaty material against my skin in the heat at all.  Thx! ",

I think it might be of interest to any other gals who used to have a lot of weight on a small rib cage frame, i.e. big boobs, that it is possible to have a bilateral mastectomy w/o reconstruction and find some comfort. I must say though that my posture is so \"humped\" now as my body really seems to \"freak\" at the loss of so much tissue weight off my front. So, for me, one who lived in Bali underwire bras since I was 15, I like the feel of a comfortable bra and the weight of lightweight prothesis - my PT noticed my posture actually improves wearing the Amoenas and the Performance bra vs. being flat... So, finding solutions to the sweating scenario was top of my list too, so I can wear them while exercising in the heat if I like. I learned a lot about sweating and different fabrics that worked from technical divers I knew who taught me how to stay as dry as possible while zipped up for a whole day in my scuba drysuit (that is like a big ziploc baggie). First and foremost rule was no cotton as the base layer!!! Thanks for all your help. BTW, your site helped inspire me in my \"dark days\" near diagnosis that there were workable options for me, besides painful reconstruction. I'm glad I took the path I did. My magnificently wonderful and experienced breast surgeon inspired me too and he and I talked at length about how, with a bilateral, I could get back into scuba and freediving again (probably with foam forms considering depth compression and such) and not have to worry about implants or weighted prothesis problems underwater (if I had kept my healthy breast), etc. I can't wait to be done with chemo/rads and get back to my life! ",

      "Content": "Aug 5, 2010 07:47PM - edited Aug 5, 2010 07:49PM by watergal I second cornelalum's post about the comfort of the Amoena Performance Sports Mastectomy Bra #2654. It works for me and I'm a very small-framed person. Plus, it isn't really a heavily influenced \"sports\" type bra - I think it is more of a \"hybrid\". It's very very comfy, supports well, breathes well and is excellent at wicking away moisture due to sweating. Only thing with me is: I am so thin after the surgery and mid-chemo that the high mid-front piece, that cornellalum notes in her post above, contacted my sternum and chafed a bit, when it was new. I haven't had a problem since I washed it, but I wish Amoena would look into making that middle piece a little softer right at the top edge.  I just noticed when trying to find the link that the size just goes to 42 so it might not work for Faith316? I find this bra runs almost true, but slightly small. Here's the link & I'm happy to hear more colors await!  Amoena Performance #2654",
