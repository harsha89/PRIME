And last week I had my MRI and my 3cm tumor has already shrunk so much they can't detect it on the MRI anymore. Tomorrow I start 4 rounds of FEC and then I'll have my surgery after. I am doing the MD Anderson protocol and I am in Texas. I am Her2+ so taking Herceptin in combo with all this chemo, and it's working. I am glad I did the weekly even though it was longer because the side effects weren't as severe and my counts stayed up.",
