My BS took alot of my axilla nodes, so I have been struggling with the arm rib cage pain. He took so many because they looked abnormal. I had to stay last night, but was discharged around 11 today. I had several doses of dualadid over night. Now it's percocet, flexeril, and ibuprofen. Sending prayers to all those scheduled for upcoming surgeries! Congrats to all that had their drains pulled.

I did find out that he took 31 nodes, so I have a better understanding of my pain. Now we wait for the oncotype results! Glad to see posts about everyones progress!

The nurse told me that he almost always only pulls one drain a week which is crazy! All 3 drains were draining only 5-10cc the last few days. Maybe he will pull both next week?!",

I got a call from the breast center the next day with my appointment. They may want additional mammogram views, ultrasound, and/or MRI. The next step would more than likely be biopsy. I hope you get some answers soon! Most of us would agree that the waiting is the worst part!",

I had to wait 3wks for what I thought would only be a biopsy of a large palpable mass that diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound at my local hospital confirmed as suspicious. When I went for my appt, they reviewed all my old films and wanted additional views of the other breast. I ended up getting 4 regular mammogram views, a 3d mammogram, ultrasound, and an MRI with contrast before they finally did the biopsy on the palpable mass Unfortunately my results showed IDC. I go back this Tuesday for 2 biopsies on the left and an ultrasound/possible biopsy of my right axilla nodes. I am so glad my GYN pushed me to go where I did! I wish you luck!
