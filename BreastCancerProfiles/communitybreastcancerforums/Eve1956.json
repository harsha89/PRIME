I feel alive again because I can bear standing in my kitchen and cooking. This is the first time since being diagnosed, I've felt this good. My wonderful Oncologist days the same. There is no correlation between my Achilles issues and arthritis, and chem, but for me even more so the Aromasin. Bad stuff. Now it's time to read up on Tomoxifen's SEs.",

Began having pain in tendon of rt elbow soon after, went to an Orthopedist who gave me cortisone shots, which didn't help much. I attributed it to carrying my Maltese, using only my rt arm and have learned to live with it. Shortly after that, I began having Achilles' tendon pain on the left foot, which I attributed to walking too much when I wasn't conditioned, having been so sick and out of work for a year. I went to a podiatrist once who prescribed rehab but said we needed to wait for my other foot to heal first(broken toes and twisted ankle from a bad fall down the stairs.) I tried to take it easy and thought over time it would go away but instead it got a lot worse. My rt Achilles' tendon on the back of my heel looked like I had a lime attached to it! Went to the same Orthopedist, who diagnosed Achilles Tendonosis, since there now appeared to be small tears in the tendon! I am in agony! Prescribed rehab, where I have going 2X week for the past 2 weeks. Slightly better but still taking mega Ibuprofin, trying to keep it elevated when I'm home from work, and icing it. The rehab therapist is the first person that told me of the correlation between chemo and Achilles' tendonitis! She suggested I look it up and here I am! I have been taking Aromasin for the past 1.5 yrs and have another 3.5 years to go. Side effect from that is constant aching, flu like, in my legs and arms but now I'm wondering if its contributing to the issues with my tendons Am seeing my Oncologist next week and will be asking him. Thanks for this post and may your bodies all be restored to how they once were!",

I said this is not the answer as I'll grow addicted. They switched me to Aromasin which was much better. Only need to take an occasional Tylenol.  Unfortunately, a bone scan showed marked deterioration in my spine after being on it for less than a year, which really scared me as I've delays had strong bones. He wanted me to take fosomax (sp?) 1x weekly to counteract that but I declined thinking enough already with all these drugs! Was a Tomoxafen for only 3 months and made the decision to stop taking it be sirs it was making me do foggy headed I couldn't do my job or function, overall.  As of this week, I'm back on the Aromasin and taking the 1x week bone fortifier. This decision was based on fear alone since in a recent pet, nodes in my lungs and near my abdomin lit up, so now I'm under going a 2nd biopsy to R/O Lymphoma. If it is lymphoma it's considered an entirely different cancer and one of the risk factors got one of the chemos they gave me.  Damned if you do or don't.  I'm so sorry the surgery didn't help. My orthopedist told me about a treatment they are having a lot of success with called platelet rich plasma therapy, I believe. It's been used for decades in the OR to speed healing, particularly when going back surgery. They have been finding its great at repairing I'm other areas but apparently insurance won't cover it because it's considered off label. Cost was about $2-3k, per ankle.  I was thinking of fighting my insurance company to cover it since the cost is way less than surgery and the recovery period is immediate. Ridiculous and cruel the way they jerk us around.  Praying things turn around for you. ",

No more arthritis in my rt knee either! Read a post that I wrote in 9/2013 where I describe being woken up at night with knee pain of 15, on a scale of 1-10! I had forgotten! I got my mom a bottle too and her arthritis pain is gone! Got mine through Amazon, Eden Gardens I think, the 1 with 5 stars. The reviews were so great, after my cousin told me about it, I had to get it.  A 2 month supply is under $25, based on taking 2000 units a day. Take 2 pills every morning. As it's a natural antiimflamitory, also has helped my mom with sinus congestion and me with the Graves Disease I have in my rt eye. Both my eyes are the same size now!!",

So when they thought they saw something and confirmed it was 1.7 on an ultrasound, sent me for a biopsy and then a MRI, which showed it as 2.2, I was not freaked out. I figured, and said to everyone, I was clear last year so I know we caught it early. I was shocked when it turned out to be 6.2 and they said I'd likely had it for years but it didn't show up on the mamo! Turns out ILC often doesn't show up until it's quite large. 2 months before my mamo, I had even seen my Gyn, who completed a breast exam and found nothing. Turned out, the cancer was against my chest wall, so my breast was covering it. So there was no lump, no pain, no indication. Except I was unusually tired but had chalked it up to working too hard and not getting enough sleep. 4 months before, I was so wiped I cancelled cooking Christmas dinner, something I've never done but now in retrospect that was a sign. I think routine ultrasounds should replace mamos, with a baseline at 35, and yearly starting at age 40. I'm so afraid for my 21 yo daughter now and am going to lobby for her to do this when she is older.  ",

Reading through all the posts I'm freaked out because my BS only did a SNB and when it came back negative, no other nodes were removed. I thought I was in the clear but now I'm not as sure. Particularly because productive coughing issues led to CT scan of my chest, after x-rays were decreed \"dirty\", which led to them seeing a Sc. lesion on my left rib (same side as UMX) and they recommended a bone scan to rule out mets. They also wanted a CT Angio after seeing nodes and areas of concern in my lungs. So 3 days ago I had a bone scan, CT Angio Scan, and an Echocardiogram. Tomorrow I see my Onco to get the resuts of the bone scan, and Friday I see my Pulmonologist to get the results of the CT Angio. Will this ever end? ",

Please keep us posted as we are all so worried about one another. My news, I have never felt so much relief in my life. After so mant tests, they tell me I am still cancer free! The Onco & Pulmo differ on what is wrong with my rib, with 1 saying it's a fracture and another saying it's radiation damage but at this point I don't care. All I know is nothing lit up on my bone scan! Onco wants me to have a bone density soon, to compare to my baseline I had done before chemo.  My cough is still with me but my CT Angio looked OK except for a nodue the Pulmo wants to keep and eye on, and wants to follow-up with a CT Scan in June.  It's amazing the effect this good news has had on me. Now instead of thinking about the end of my life, I'm focused on the menu I'll serve for Super Bowl Sunday and little issues have become menaagable again. I feel very blessed but hate that every little ache gets blown up into \"Has the cancer spread?\" Enjoy the weekend dear ones!   ",

The BS was RUSHING me to schedule surgery and gave me option of a lump or MX but said I was good candidate for a lump. They did blood work right in their office, sent me next door for a chest x-ray and had me scheduled for surgery in another 10 days! Maybe it was the rushing, and so much information being thrown at me, I told her I wanted to get a 2nd opinion and could she recommend a couple people. She gave me the name of the doctor in practice with her and said \"I could also give you the name of a brilliant surgeon down at Yale but she's a cold hearted bitch.\" Then she went on to say, BSs are BSs and this was a pretty straight forward surgery and the time for me to be seeking a 2nd opinion would be when I was deciding on an Oncologist, but not now. I smiled and said I still wanted to get a 2nd opinion and would like the name of the \"cold hearted bitch down at Yale\". She turned beet red and gave it to me. Saw the 2nd BS, found her to be very professional but also warm and forthcoming. First thing she wanted to do was have Yale's Pathologists look at the slides. There report came back that both areas were the same, both ILC! We talked and she said she often finds with ILC, the size turns out bigger than what what the tests reveal and she often sees tumors as big 5cm, even though the tests say otherwise. She too gave me both options, lump or MX but given I had ILC, if it turned out to be large, there would be a lot of breast tissue missing, and with lumpectomies, there is no option for reconstruction. WHAT????  BS1 never mentioned that! That made my decision, and when it was all over and BS2 came in to see me she said I had made the right decision, due to the 6+cm tumor size. So it always pays to get a 2nd opinion and follow your gut! Seems like some doctors are very knowledgeable, while others are still on the learning curve and we're their Guenna pigs! ",
