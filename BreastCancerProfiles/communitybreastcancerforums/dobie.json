I talked to my MO last week and asked him about getting a Oncotype Dx. I did not feel strongly about getting it because the 2 ILC tumors found in my breast were 0.2 cm each so I really don't think that qualifies for chemo no matter what the Oncotype # is. And i just had UmX on previously radiated breast, so won't be getting rads. Agreed to Aromatase inhibitor. But I told him I could not ignore the option of a PMX to manage risk in my left breast especially since this is not easily seen on mamo or MRI. My thinking is that a low Oncotype will be reassuring and a higher one will steer me toward surgery. I know this is not really what this test is designed for. But MO was sympathetic to my dilemma and ordered the test and insurance covers 100% so husband says, why not? Im kinda surprised he went with it , i wasnt realy pushing for it, just wanted to address the issue. Now i am wondering what i am going to do with this information when i get it especially if its high. Anyone have ideas, knowledge, opinion, data on this ? I am ER 100% + PR neg, her2 neg. don't see a ki67 on my report but mitotic score is 1 (low). So I really don't expect a high score but from what I'm reading here, you never know for sure.",

It did not change my survival. That is because, when you have a small relatively nonaggresive tumor which has not gone to lymph nodes your survival rate is very good no matter what you do. And if it does reoccur it will probably be small and non aggressive again. Probably. Like Dianarose said, no one has a crystal ball. I chose not to take medication and just had a reocurrance. Again early detection is my saving grace and this cancer still will not effect my survival rate much, but it cost me my breast this time. I decided to take a aromatase inhibitor this time. Cancer is just no fun, and I don't want to press my luck any further. That's me. Everyone has to decide for themselves taking into consideration their tolerance for risk of disease vs risks associated with medications. No easy choices.",

I wish you had better options for yourself. I wish we all had better options. That's what I mean, no easy decisions. Lisa2012- this is my understanding of survival vs reocurrance: Not everyone who gets BC dies of BC. Those of us who have early, small cancers detected then treated are not very likely to die of the disease even if it reoccurs. Our survival rate is darned near 100%. So taking tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI). Will reduce the risk of reocurrance but it will not change risk of dying of BC because our risk is already very very small. This is the reason that some people will chose not to take the risk of hormonal therapies. Some chose to live with the risk of reocurrance rather than the risks of side effects and change in quality of life from tami and AIs. But there are so many other factors that go into individual decisions, that is why it is so personal. I have been very impressed (for the most part) with the respect posters have for each others decisions. Julz4- I have been a women's health care provider and certified menopause practitioner for many years and have read a lot of studies about hormones and birth control. There is no evidence that hormones cause breast cancer. The combination of estrogen and progestin together may slightly increase risk of BC but does not cause it. In fact the 2002 WHI study that got so much press actually showed that taking estrogen only, decreased risk. Your friend with the hysterectomy, almost certainly got just estrogen since progestins are given with estrogen to protect against uterine cancer which is a SE of unapposed estrogen. Truth is no one knows for sure what causes BC other than the BRCA gene. Yeah, that pretty much causes it, but other than that...We all know people who seemingly have no risk factors and get it and those who took hormones, drink , don't exercise, eat unhealthily who never will get it. Go figure. Irregardless, no one deserves it. Let's hope in our lifetimes we see this puzzle solved. Ok. That's my 2 cents worth. Edited to add: Purple 32- You do know that Tamoxifen actually acts like estrogen on bone and can increase bone mass, don't you?",

Guidelines are just that and not law. Each physician or system can make their own judgements and decisions about testing. Obviously, Mass general has a policy not to order testing in cases like Purple's. But policies can be changed, so I also encourage you to push for it. I got a call from genomics a few days after MO ordered test stating that insurance would cover test and did I want to go ahead with it? The MO ordered it on condition of my final approval, giving me the choice to have it or not after knowing insurance status. I am one of those cases, as voracious stated above, where my score will help me make other treatment decisions besides chemo. Good luck, Purple.",

Lit says this particular beast effects both breasts and is multifocal therefore a logical option is BMX. Geesh! The docs don't know what is best for you. They have all told me that my chances of survival, which is very good BTW wont change no matter what i decide There is no right or wrong.

I did not see the report yet since the surgeon got a verbal report after paging the pathologist since it wasnt posted at my appointment on Friday. It was taking longer 'cause the pathologist was having a 2nd pathologist look at my slides. So I don't have all the details. It was very small. I think he said 2mm with 4 mm clear margin, except for a few cells of LCIS around the edge. After doing some looking I have learned that ILC is relatively rare-10-15% of BC compared with 80% IDC. I have also read that it is more often multifocal and contralateral. It is not easily dx since it often does not show up on mammogram or US. It seems that it was a pure accident that they found this ILC since it was the DCIS that showed up on the mammogram. How can I know there is not more unseen ILC lurking in either breast? I know I need to wait for the rest of the picture ( I will get a copy of my report on Monday) and my case is going to the tumor board next week so I will wait to see what they say but this seems to be a horse of a whole different color.

I came home from hospital with breast wrapped and supported in foam tape like a bra which I slowly peeled off after about a week My drain site was right where the edge of a bra would lie so it has not been comfortable to wear one and PS said no problem. I have taped my nips flat as needed or wore tops which did not show . I do have a couple Genie bras and have worn them a few times. I like them. If you decide on getting then I recommend getting a bigger size than what they say on box so they are not too tight.

Drain not quite ready to come out yet. As anxious as I am to get rid of this annoying contraption, don't want a seroma either so I wil be patient a few more days. She also told me that the tumor board recommends that my nipple come off due to path report indicating LCIS in nipple tissue. Bummer. So much for the nipple sparing part of the NSMX. She wants the mastectomy scar to heal so I will have surgery to remove nipple in 6 months. Maybe I can knit myself just a nipple! Happy Holidays! Best wishes all, hope you are healing or waiting well. Keep,your spirits up. We are all in this together and somehow that makes it easier. http://theknittingexperience.com/knitted_knockers_program/",

And as feared they did find invasive lobular cancer (ILC), 2 very small areas 0.2 cm each. The area of LCIS was >4 cm. 4 nodes negative. The most disappointing finding was LCIS in nipple tissue which means the nip will probably have to go. I am so not surprised about the ILC. That is exactly what happened to me 5 years ago. And now I am seriously rethinking the PMX for my left breast. How can they know what is lurking there? So some good news ( neg nodes, small IBC) and some not so great news ( nipple goes?) They will present my case at tumor board on thurs and make recommendations. Oh BTW, got one drain removed, go back next week.",

Here are my comments: Yes, I have that tight feeling across chest. Usually happens in the evening when I am tired. My impression is that it is a pectoral muscle spasm since implant is stuffed under it stretching it out and it's not happy about it. My PS gave me a muscle relaxer called Soma which seems to help a lot more than a pain pill . And yes, I am numb too. It really bothers me the most. Feels like this part of my body does not belong to me. I bought the Genie bra before surgery and like it as well. According to box I would take a med. but I got a XXL for comfort. Has anyone heard of the group who makes \"knitted knockers\" for those who have not gotten reconstruction. Was that here? Can't remember which forum I heard about this on. Anyway, these would be great to stuff into the genie bra pockets if you need it. If you goggle this should be able to find it. I have been sleeping on a bed wedge covered with pillows since surgery. I am a terrible flip flopper in my sleep and like to sleep on my stomach. I was afraid I would pull the drains out. With the wedge and a pillow under my knees it has kept me on my back and fairly comfortable. Keep healing everyone. Keep your fingers crossed that my drain gives it up so I can get it removed tomorrow. Since it has been hovering at 30 cc for days I have my doubts, but one can hope. Yes, I have acellular dermis matrix ( alloderm generic) .",

Plan nipple nipping in december. Congratulations to all of us in the May mastectomy class of 2012. We made it.

I talked to my MO last week and asked him about getting a Oncotype Dx. I did not feel strongly about it cause the 2 ILC tumors in my breast were 0.2 cm each so I really don't think that qualifies for chemo no matter what the Oncotype # is. But I told him I could not ignore the option of a PMX to manage risk in my left breast especially since this is not easily seen on mamo or MRI. My thinking is that a low Oncotype will be reassuring and a higher one will steer me toward surgery. I know this is not really what this test is designed for. But MO was sympathetic to my dilemma and ordered the test and insurance covers 100% so husband says, why not? Now i am wondering what i am going to do with this information when i get it Anyone have info, knowledge, opinion, data on this ?",

But don't worry about it because they put it in after you are asleep and take it out before you wake up. The only way I knew about this is because I asked. Soyandpepper-I would bet you had one and just didn't know. Can you imagine 7.5 hours with them pumping IV fluid into you?",

The calcium deposits are a byproduct of increased cell growth. Tx depends on the size of the tumor and that may not be determined until surgery. If it looks contained in one area of the breast they may give you the option of a lumpectomy. That is what I had. Outpatient, easy-peasy. If it looks larger they may recommend a mastectomy. When you have surgery they will test your lymph nodes to make sure it hasn't spread. Mine had not spread outside the breast so I had 7 weeks of radiation to that breast with very few side effects. All in all the worse part of my experience was the numbing fear. I always tell people that if I knew then what I know now I would have saved myself a ton of worry. So my advise to you is to try and not get too far ahead of yourself. About 90% of everything we worry about never happens. I wish you a easy and safe journey thru this scary experience.",

Secondly, it has been very interesting to me how sure others ( without BC) are about what they would do if faced with this decision. \"oh I would have them both off\". Or \" why on earth would anyone have a healthy breast removed?\". As those of us who are faced with this dilemma knows, it is not an easy decision. I had hx of ILC 5 yrs ago with lump and rads. Now suspicious mammo and biopsy with pathology of pleomorphic LCIS in same breast. Despite that they gave me the option of just a local excision. BS said there is no evidence of invasive ca at this time, no reason for mx at this time. Except if IBC is found and mx is definitely needed cosmetic option of nip/ skin sparing mx is gone. So my decision is a UMX. Not ready to give up both despite increased risk in other breast. If tests, tami, worry gets too much I will reconsider. But now this feels right for me. I will not regret my decision, I will not look back. Just move forward. Good luck to all in coming to peace in your own heads with your own decision. Amen.",

One thing we looked at was betacarotenes in the fluid and if there was a difference between women who had breast fed or not. Anyway.. the point I want to make is that everyone will get some nipple discharge to some extent with enough stimulation. We had clear, yellow, green maybe it depends on diet too. In general unless the fluid is spontaneous or bloody I don't think it is too worrisome. I do women's health care (nurse midwife) and I have done slides for patients like a PAP smear on breast fluids and send to pathology just to be sure. It may be worth it for peace of mind. Good luck.",

She says not everyone is. But since LCIS is not invasive, as long as it is not close to nipple or skin it can be done safely.  Even my pretty conservative BS has agreed to it  now and 5 years ago he said no way.   I had a lumpectomy at that time.",
