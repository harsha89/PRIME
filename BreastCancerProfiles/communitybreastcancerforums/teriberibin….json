    "Content": "Mar 14, 2016 04:59AM - edited Mar 14, 2016 05:06AM by teriberibin I battled fibroadenomas from the time I was 17. I am now 61. At first, all of my lumps were excised. As time went on, we attempted to just monitor them for growth. If they grew, they were removed. A total of eight were removed bilaterally. One had infiltrated my chest wall. We were erring on the side of caution because my grandmother, her sister, and two second cousins had or died from BC. The problem with removal is the scar tissue. By age 59, after losing my mom to OC, my uncle to prostate cancer, and unable to have an MRI with contrast, I decided it was time to take the BRCA test. I knew in my heart it would positive and I was correct: BRCA 2 positive (my daughter tested negative, thank goodness). I had a double prophylactic mastectomy and oomphectomy/salpingectomy (already had my uterus removed). I finished reconstruction in Oct 2015, with nipple tattoos by Vinnie Meyers. So unless you have a family history of BC or have tested positive for BRCA, I would try to monitor any fibroadenoma, after a confirming core needle biopsy, as the scar tissue from excision can make it difficult to be followed. I had five core needle biopsies in one day because I could not have an MRI and there was so much \"junk\" showing up on the ultrasound and mammogram. So my next step was clear as I was too hard to monitor.",
