After just winning a second-level appeal for medical necessity for a Solaris compression vest where the insurance co needed to be educated on truncal LE and was asking for clinical studies and peer-reviewed articles for the garment, I find this frightening. We need research, but not faulty research that will make it even harder to have our LE validated and treated.",

During the more intensive phase of treatment, my LE therapist cut a medium density orange foam into a panel that ran from the side of my breast area, under my arm and slightly around back and down the side of my chest. The back part went up behind my arm. It was shaped like the side of a vest. Anyway, the foam provided firmer pressure, and I wore a tank a size larger just so I could fit one on each side. It was a PIA, not very comfortable, but it worked. Since the tank was larger, it didn't seem to rise up much, especially if I wore panties on outside. (such an attractive look, not!) Later on I wore the swell spots with a smaller size tank. I wore the orange foam and/or the swell spots with a tank 24/7 for four months, and I think it helped stabilize my LE. This is actually my current get-up for flying, and it does the job. I want to get the kind of vest Binney describes, but I am having to fight with my insurance to approve. The vest sounds ideal, but in the meantime at least you have a viable solution. The torso is such a pain to deal with. The good thing about the swell spots under the tank is that not only does it provide extra pressure, but it can lift the edge of the tank away from the sensitive area while still providing compression. So, it may sound makeshift and hair brained, but my LE therapist is in the Phila area and highly trained. Sometimes a creative idea is what works best! Good luck in your quest to find a nighttime garment.",

He has worked on the intercostal area between the ribs, which also has the effect of stimulating lymphatics in that area. It could be breaking up scars or just working the lymphatics, or a combination, but it definitely worked for me. There have been a couple of times when I had a slight amount of swelling after a session, but with lots of water and MLD, it went away by the next day. Interesting thing about myofascial is that it has the same effect on me as a MLD session, and I have to urinate immediately after. My guy always provides water and encourages it after a session.

Either in bed or when walking, there was much less pulling in the neck and it was easier to do things with my arms and hands without worry of catching the tube on something. I could have handled it a couple more days without a problem. The anesthesiologist definitely has to be comfortable doing a neck IV. When I have discussed having this done for other procedures, some offices and hospitals made it sound like it was dangerous and they could cut your jugular. Apparently there are smaller veins in the neck that are easy to access, so it is more a matter of doctor experience and comfort with doing vs being extremely dangerous. You will need to request a neck IV at the time you schedule your surgery so there are no surprises the day of surgery. Good luck! Don't let them bully you into putting your arm at risk for LE.",

PS and I agreed to give myofascial treatment 2-3 mths, and if there is still problem with implant and pain, then he would do surgery.   ",

She was connected to the hospital where I had my surgeries.  Fast forward to April 09, and I experience a flare up of LE while traveling to Fla.  My implant also begins to distort and shift.   At this point, I educate myself further on truncal LE, visit the Step Up site and locate a LANA-certified therapist in my area.       I return home and see my PS, who looks at my arm and says I don't have LE, it's \"activity swelling\".  I tell him about truncal LE and that I want a script for LE evaluation.  He tells me to see my BS since he's the guy who took out my sentinel node (the only node removed) but that he will write a script if I need it.  About the change in appearance of implant and development of pain, he says I may have early capsular contracture and prescribes Accolate.  I'm supposed to call back in month to report whether Accolate is working.   I then see my BS and he looks at my arm and says I don't have LE. I remind him that my initial PT back in Dec. had diagnosed me as having mild LE.  I insist that I need a prescription to have this new swelling in my chest looked at by a LANA-certified therapist, that LE could impact the quality of my life and I wasn't taking any chances.  He writes me a script.  I see the new LE therapist, and she takes one look at me and says I definitely have truncal LE.  I\u2019ve seen her regularly for MLD sessions over the past few months and just recently have been cut loose since my LE is considered under control and I can manage by myself.  Will follow up in 3-6 months.  I have been referred to a qualified LE massage therapist for monthly massage.     So, now I'm still dealing with the implant and it's poor appearance.  I'm also dealing with increasing back, shoulder and neck pain (knots and spasming) and a lot of tightness across my right implant, which is the one that\u2019s distorted.  That's my LE side, too.  From the beginning, my gut feeling has been that the scarring and tightness is somehow connected to the LE.  I'm thinking the constriction of the muscle and scarring may be preventing the flow of LE fluid.  My LE therapist said she didn't think they were connected, but that they probably didn't help one another.  This is true -- when one issue is exacerbated, the other seems to bother me more as well.   After a month of Accolate and no change, I call and talk with nurse and PS says to continue for second month.  After second month, there is still no change and nurse says he suggests taking for another six months.  I hit the ceiling, and tell her I'm getting a second opinion.  She tells me to keep my follow-up appt. in July and PS will look at implant.  I see 2nd PS first and he confirms Stage 2-3 CC and says massage won't work, Accolate won't work, and that surgery is only answer and he will give me new implant.  I then go back to my PS and he confirms Stage 2 CC but says implant is softer than it usually is for CC.  I tell him I have been doing massage of tissue/muscle and get some relief from that.  We also talk about the Accolate and I decide I will continue and see him in early Nov. and then we will determine what to do.  Beginning of Sept., my Accolate script is done and I still haven't had any pain relief or change in implant.  I decide not to spend another $300 and stop the medication.  Stopping doesn't negatively effect implant or pain.   So, I'm talking with a friend who is a PT (not in my state) and tell him how I've been doing self massage of implant and area around it and getting some kind of relief but can't reach certain areas by myself.  He refers me to a local PT skilled in myofascial release and suggests I try this as a last attempt to avoid surgery.  My whole concern is what is the cause of the problem with my implant?  Is it the capsule itself that is distorting the implant?   Is there scarring in the tissue and muscle outside the capsule that is creating tightness and pain and distorting the implant?  Is there cording?  And does this constriction and/or scarring have any effect on my ability to manage (or resolve) the LE?     If the capsule isn\u2019t the cause of my problem, then I don\u2019t think replacing the implant will correct the pain and tightness in my back, neck and pectoral area.  I am trying to avoid surgery for obvious reasons, but also out of concern for exacerbating the LE.  And it seems that many women who\u2019ve had CC and had their implant replaced often develop CC again.    Just what is the difference between CC, scar tissue in muscle or tissue, and cording?  Are they all one in the same?   I know you gals can\u2019t diagnose my issue, but I hope you can help me sort through all this.   If you\u2019ve stayed with my post to the end, thank you for reading!!   Tina \"Life isn't about finding yourself, life is about creating yourself.\" ~ George Bernard Shaw Dx 11/13/2007, DCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

During the several months of testing prior to my surgery, I heard multiple opinions about MRIs and it being the \"gold standard\", giving false positives, etc. I think what's also important to note is that this phenomenal newer equipment is only as good as those who are administering and reading the test results. For instance, if one feels the need to get an MRI, I would suggest going to a hospital or breast center that has had MRI equipment longer and the most experience with it. Newer breast centers can still be on the learning curve when it comes to being able to diagnose DCIS via MRI. I've also heard there are debates about digital vs. regular mammos and their ability to detect areas of concern in younger and older women, since the quality of breast tissue changes during/after menopause. I don't know the full story on this, as it was related to me by a friend. Perhaps a full menu of diagnostic equipment is more useful at this point than saying one is the \"best\"? I know everyone wants to find the perfect test that will give a definitive diagnosis -- the experience of trying to figure out what to do when faced with cancer is absolutely frightening -- but I just don't believe we are there yet. And, yes, I agree you have to be your own best advocate and go with your gut feeling about the testing you need.",

In Nov. 2007, I had a digital mammo which found two areas of calcifications in my RB, one more suspicious looking than the other. Stereotactic biopsy was planned to examine suspicious area, but by accident the more innocent looking area was biopsied. This area was confirmed as DCIS. My breast surgeon assumed the more suspicious area was also connected and order MRI. MRI showed two additional areas of suspicion, one in RB and another in LB. These new-found areas were biopsied via ultrasound and results were negative. Surgeon then had them biopsied via MRI and results were negative. MRI at that time found additional area that looked suspicious which was then biopsied but turned out negative as well. I asked to have original suspicious area found via mammo to be biopsied before I submitted to surgery and this was done stereotactically. Results were negative, so I was left with the tiny original area found by accident as only area of DCIS. Surgeon recommended lumpectomy, followed by rads and tamox. I went for second op and he concurred with original surgeon's recommendation. I went for third op and he also concurred. It was my family physician that urged me to think of the long-term health of my breasts and health in general and to consider mastectomy. In the end, I new I couldn't live with the anxiety of two mammos a year and annual MRI, knowing I'd most likely have more biopsies. I'd already had six. I opted for bilateral mastectomy with expanders. When pathology analyzed my breast tissue, they found an additional area of DCIS in my RB as well as a small area of microinvasion. They also found two areas of DCIS in my LB. These were not the areas that were biopsied, and had not shown up on digital mammo, ultrasound or MRI tests. There was no lymph involvement. My breast surgeon agreed I had made the right decision. My breast surgeon, oncologist, radiation oncologist now consider me to be \"cured\" and to have no further need for treatment, although I am currently undergoing genetic counseling to determine if there is any risk for ovarian cancer. I am hoping I am all clear and can move on and live life without worry. It was a hard decision to make -- lumpectomy/rads/drugs vs. completely removing my breasts and making the commitment to the long reconstructive process. It is clearly a personal decision, but I am so relieved that I took what seemed to be the more drastic action. In hindsight, it definitely was the right thing to do. After years of the standard being mastectomy, the current trend is breast conserving surgery. This is a wonderful advancement in cancer treatment, but in some cases when there seems to be a lot going on in a woman's breasts or conditions make it difficult to get a good read on what's happening, I agree, sometimes safe is better than sorry. It is your health and life, and nothing is more important than that.",

However, without proper guidance, I'm not sure I feel right about giving her a copy of the protocol and the weights. If there was some way she could come and observe, it would be great. It's just so unfair that she doesn't have access to this because of her insurance. I told my friend that we would hire the trainer to show her the program and how to properly use the weights. When my LE doctor was describing the group program, she explained they were trying to figure out how to take the info they had gathered from the study and get it out to the public in a responsible way. When you think about how the media totally made a mess of reporting on the results of the PAL study, you really can't blame them. So, it would seem at this point that patients need insurance to take the group class, and trainers need to be PT's that can bill for LE treatment. Do I understand that right? That's how it was being offered to me. I suppose with my surgery, last year was extraordinary as far as needing treatment, but I really don't like the idea of \"wasting\" what my insurance provides for an exercise program. As much as I would like to take the group program, I might as well have the one-on-one time in my home. My friend can purchase the weights and then come do it with me. That way it's safe and she has access. I think with all the appeal crap I am dealing with, I would do better to take advantage of my ability to get the training without involving my insurance. My trainer has the protocol for the home version as well, which is what we used in my house, but she is willing to go with me to my gym once I am stronger. I will play the cancer and lymphedema cards to scare off the regular gym trainers so they can't argue about her training me! Carol, congrats on modifying your bike! That's terrific! And I am so excited that once you get your sleeve and gauntlet that you will be starting a weight lifting program. I love your tenacity and motivation to bring the PAL program to your town and help give your trainer and others in the area a chance to get training in how to use the program and work with other women.",

I was surprised at how easy I could use them at home. Also, less expensive than buying a bunch of handweights and easier to store. I waited until the gym equipment shop had a sale and got $50 off. The heavier set is more pricey - I got the ones that go to 30-33 lbs. ",

When I contacted my trainer, it was through her personal number. She explained she did home visits for X amount, but I could also train with her at the YCMA where she had been part of the PAL study - had to get a membership, pay a monthly fee, and then pay extra for trainer appts on top of all that! That's crazy and just wrong for them to charge a cancer survivor with LE those kind of rates so they can learn how exercise safely! Naturally, I decided to have her come to my house. She was excited when she learned I had purchased the PowerBloc weights. She suggested I keep my membership to PF so I have access to aerobic equipment. In the past I belonged to much nicer gyms, back when trainers supervised people working out as part of their job. Now all the \"good\" (and expensive) gyms in my area are totally hands off and you have to pay for a trainer to help you do anything. I understood the basics of good form and movement and finally bailed on the expensive gyms. Since my trainer will eventually help me incorporate some of the machines when my legs are stronger, PF is just fine. I would rather pay for occasional workouts with my trainer as needed than a huge monthly rate. Speaking of modifications to exercises, yes, the planks were ones that we avoided. We did talk about modifying those types of exercises so I may eventually work up to doing. My reconstruction was awful when it came to using chest muscles, and I am hoping that with the implants gone and muscles repaired that I will be able to (slowly) do more. I agree that it's best to avoid using my insurance for workouts. I might as well have one-on-one attention anyway, especially since it can be at home or in the gym. I have to admit I love that I can do a full body workout with weights in my own home. After all those years of mostly using weight machines, I am a free weight convert now that I understand how they also work the stabilizer muscles in addition to the specific muscle being exercised. Most likely, I will probably only use the machines for my legs at some point.",

I have been fortunate to live in the area where the PAL study was conducted, and my LE therapist hooked me up with one of the trainers who participated in the PAL study. She came to my home and ran me through the home version of the PAL study, which uses hand held free weights. I purchased the PowerBloc free weights that can be adjusted in one pound increments. I'd like to point out that while I love the PAL routine, there were a couple of weight exercises that the trainer modified the positions for me, as I felt there was too much pressure on my arm or trunk. I ended up using the bands for my back because I actually had more control that way, and the particular bands I have and used were right for me. Those bands are definitely hard to determine tension, for sure, and one time when I adjusted my distance from the door or even a slight change in angle, sheesh! I had a flare. Same goes for when I thought I could move up to the other bands. All I know is I need to be in a specific position for the exercise to work and not cause a problem (I guess I can never move from this house!) I think all exercise programs must be adjusted to address each person's needs, especially when one already has LE. It is so frustrating that there is no out-of-the-box program that works for a everyone! I haven't tried the Norton exercises, but I have done the Lebed. When I first did the Lebed, I didn't have any issues, but once I started feeling comfortable with the program, I started to push it a little too much. I think this is such a natural response, especially when exercise feels good. I have to really watch that element of self control no matter what form of exercise I'm doing. Who doesn't want to do more when their body seems to be tolerating? Too much is only evident after the fact!",

The one we found was light weight aluminum and had several extension pieces.  DH had to use three times - once after first storm, and then twice during second blizzard.  He was able to clear part of the roof from the ground, but also had to go onto adjacent roof (!) to clear another portion, and then onto a raised bed behind the house to reach the remaining part.  We didn't have any further leaking after first round of raking, and the ice that had been running down the side of the house melted and didn't accumulate after second storm.  By the way, DH wore those slip on traction thingies on his boots, but it was still pretty scary, esp. when the wind got going! ",

I do have a small arm. Just realized I might be wrapped for Dr. Massey's LE conference in DC on the 17th. Hmm, hopefully it will be warm enough that I can wear my down vest. I don't have any jacket with a large sleeve. Guess a men's sweat shirt from Target. So fashionable!",

I started making fun of the DVD, which was kind of fun, so I continued for the rest of the program taunting and making fun of the weird instructions, cheers, and \"dancing!\", etc. It actually made me feel more powerful and in control, and I liked that! \"Life isn't about finding yourself, life is about creating yourself.\" ~ George Bernard Shaw Dx 11/13/2007, DCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Aug 22, 2011 12:27PM Tina337 wrote: The week before last, I flew out of Phila, and for the first time we were in the line for the scanner. My husband and I both opt out but stay in public area. So, husband goes first, and they make sure to take his luggage that's been screened off to the side within his vision. I am told to wait, and I think that was so they could put my luggage aside after it was screened. I asked the TSA person standing with me about my luggage, and was told the person who would be scanning me was getting it right then and taking over to where I would be patted down. She then tells me to go over to the spot where I would be screened. The woman was very nice and described exactly what she was going to do. I then told her that I had had a bilateral mastectomy but was not wearing prosthetics. I also mentioned I had lymphedema on the side of my chest which was sensitive. The whole process was quite respectful and uneventful, and even though she had said what she would do, she said it again each step of the way before she did it. When she got to my chest she said to let her know it I was experiencing discomfort, and I repeated to just be a little careful on the side. As far as my feelings about being patted down and the TSA person able to feel lumps and bumps, I just don't care about that. I have worked so hard to get to a point where I am comfortable with my body, and if I can deal with it, then so can some stranger. I have had a few plastic surgeon exams that made me feel more uncomfortable than this process. Since I had surgery in April to undo my reconstruction and take out my implants, my chest is not smooth and flat. I wear a compression tank to keep my truncal lymphedema in check, so I had that on for the flight. I usually insert \"swell spots\" on the sides of my chest for extra compression, but I waited until after going through security to put those on as well as both of my compression sleeves and gloves. This always requires that I arrive at the airport at least two hours before my flight so I can go through security and then have time to don my swell spots, sleeves and gloves and have them on an hour before takeoff. I could get annoyed by this, but I find going early and preparing this way eliminates this part of the stress of flying. I know this is a personal thing, but I am more freaked out about a potential LE flare that flying could cause than the security aspect of things. (This isn't to say I approve of these security changes.) I find once I am \"suited up\" that this tends to take me emotionally to a different place - reminded of my BC, LE, the feelings of sadness that things are no longer simple and how much my life has changed, the awareness that people can and do notice my sleeves and gloves. Since my deconstruction, I am now wearing sleeves and gloves on both arms, so this makes me a little more self conscious, as does being flat chested. There's also an element of claustrophobia I experience wearing all this armor, not to mentioned getting a little overheated, so flying is no longer a part of the vacation I welcome. In fact, it is a little trauma and anxiety producing. However, when compared to sitting in a car for many hours, which for me usually causes a LE flare, I'll take flying any day!",

Also, yes, your therapist should instruct you and then you do it to show you understand. We need to know how much pressure is right, how quickly to perform the strokes, etc. Once she is satisfied you have an understanding of how to do, you would practice on your own between sessions. When you return she should want to know how you think you are doing, has it been helpful, and watch you do again and provide necessary correction. As far as when to do MLD, I try to do morning and night, but definitely at night since I have more swelling by the end of the day. I may skip mornings. Before exercise I usually stimulate the nodes or do the Lebed opening.",

I got impatient once when I had a small area of tape left and pulled it off carefully. It left a bit of a welt but didn't look raw. I did exactly as you are doing with the neosporin. Didn't cover with a bandage and went without my tank for a day, wore a loose soft cotton shirt. It cleared up in a couple of days.",

I started making fun of the DVD, which was kind of fun, so I continued for the rest of the program taunting and making fun of the weird instructions, cheers, and \"dancing!\", etc. It actually made me feel more powerful and in control, and I liked that! \"Life isn't about finding yourself, life is about creating yourself.\" ~ George Bernard Shaw Dx 11/13/2007, DCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I am going to check how far I am walking in the hilly neighborhood, but my goal for now is to walk for at least 45 min to an hour. MLD or Lebed after. Does anyone have a recommendation on what to look for with a pedometer? Is there something that combines with a stopwatch? Going to the sporting store later to get one and check out UA tops. Washed out half of my stash of tanks, sleeves and gloves and they are hanging. I need to pick up mesh laundry bags for washing bandages, etc. So, today is all about exercise, self care, and organizing system to keep my tool box in top form!",

I had no idea you have a special left-handed keyboard to avoid swelling on right side. The compromises you have made and setbacks you experience without broadcasting amaze me. Makes me feel like I have a glass head! I can't keep quiet about a freakin' hangnail! I just checked your BC.org membership date, and I am shocked to see that it is 2004! Do you mind me asking how long you have had LE? We are so used to looking up to you for info that sometimes I think we forget a little (okay, I will selfishly admit that I do) that you have your own struggles with self care and have had to cope and adapt to accommodate your LE. The fact that we are mostly aware of your activism and incredible kindness and generosity with your time here really overshadows these things. I suppose that is a sign that you work hard to not have LE define who you are in life. You seem to have found a way to thrive in spite of the ups and downs of LE, and that is very much the point of this thread. I really hope this left side hurting while typing is a temporary thing. Yay for walking, dog training AND chocolate covered blueberries!",

Let's see what happens now. Welcome, justmejanis. The gals here are terrific and keep everyone going. Yes, I think basic and no frills is actually a good way to start. It lets you get into the groove at your own pace. There's no pressure, and you can stay aware of how your body is responding to movements and gently urge yourself to do more when it feels right. I believe when it is easy at first, it is actually more motivating, seems less like drudgery. Anything to make it fun or a great experience helps. That's why I love the ball and walking outside. The ball makes me feel like a kid, and blooming flowers, trees, and listening to birds sing make me feel terrific. Music has always been a big deal to me, and having my own private dance party in my living room is more my idea of a good workout vs the Lebed dance routine. Whatever works for You is the most important. Okay, it looks like I am going to be able to post, so I should report in. Yesterday I did trunk MLD in the morning and full routine at bed, wore compression all day. Took tank off for sleeping, as I was feeling claustrophobic big time. 500 steps, bouncing, Hulk breathing and node clearing a few times during day. Staying hydrated. Hand is feeling pretty good, and arm seems to be doing much better. I really think the exercise is helping. Torso is actually starting to feel better, I think it's a little trimmer, as my clothes are feeling more comfy in the waist. This morning I did trunk MLD and I am wearing compression. Lovely outside, and I am definitely going out to take a walk. KIRA - when I used to start working out after a hiatus, I would actually gain weight because I was building muscle. Only after a couple weeks did my clothes fit better. So, you are doing terrific! Don't let the scale get inside your head. I actually weighted almost 10 pounds more when I was at my fittest, but I wore the same size. No one ever believed me when I said what I weighed. Muscle weighs more than fat. By the way, tomorrow will be FOUR WEEKS since I posted this topic and began to exercise! The time has just flown by, and I can hardly believe how much I have stayed consistent with self care, continued to exercise, and gently push myself to do more and more. I couldn't have done it without you guys! Thank you so much for the motivation and keeping me accountable. I can't say that everything is second nature to me yet, but I've noticed I'm spending more time doing MLD than griping about having to do it. And my compliance with compression has changed dramatically.",

Smells nice, not like you've bathed in patchouli. She is particular and checks on things, and I trust her recommendations, and she says it works. Doesn't have deet. I have searched and learned you can buy neem oil and add to other lotions and other body products. It is supposed to be safe and actually healthy to apply to skin. So, this is what I am going to use this summer, but I don't know the precise product. I will ask her. After three years of deet, I am done. Tired of having to shower to get the darn stuff off. Meanwhile, you can google and find out all kinds of things neem is used for. Yes, it can be used for gardening. I need to learn more about how it works and whether it is something BC women need to avoid, but as far as I know, it is not an issue. I am also interested in the anti-inflammatory aspect of if. ",

I should have worn my pedometer today, as I might have worked in more steps than anticipated. All in all, a very productive day. Not so great exercise-wise, but ridding myself of some stressful tasks and worries will have a positive effect on my LE, too.

With my rash waxing and waning on my bad arm, my therapist said not to wear sleeve, but I wondered if wrapping overnight  might be okay. I always lotion up well before wrapping because I know it is drying, but since dry skin is my current issue, do you think I should stay away from wrapping until it settles down? Also, is powder drying? And if so, is it something I would avoid if my rash ultimately cycles into a patch of dry skin?  I had a realization after I stepped out of shower yesterday and noticed MORE splotches of rash popping up in new areas. First of all, I am not showering with real hot water, so I don't think that is the cause. However, it is after each shower that new areas of rash appear. I think before I went to DC I may have opened two new boxes of Dove soap. I usually use the unscented version, but I had purchased the sensitive skin version because they didn't have the other. When I had researched my soap and other personal products on the Environmental Working Group's website, I read the unscented version was safer than the sensitive skin one. I hadn't really thought about that being a possibility because I have used before without issue. Dermatologist told me manufacturers can slightly change ingredients in products without having to mention on label, so maybe that's what happened. I know I've experienced that with shampoo I have used for a while. After I buy a new bottle, I will have pimple breakouts on face or back. After switching brands - which is a process in itself to find a new favorite shampoo - the pimples go a way. If I have been lucky enough to have old bottle to compare to new one, I can usually see where they have indeed changed some of the ingredients. I know lanolin and me don't get along, but I have no idea about others. So, since my rash seems to be shower related, I am going to switch my body soap and see what happens. Fortunately, I have a special bar of olive oil soap that EWG rated #1, so I will use that for a while. Hugz, Vincent is doing well. So hard to decide on favorite, but there were about five or six I had to go back and see again before I left. I spent 2 3/4 hrs in there and could have stayed longer but husband was ready to go. He can't stand quite as long as I can, but most of the time we are similarly paced in museums. Sometimes I catch myself standing in front of a painting feeling drugged, almost as if I could fall into it. Probably a bit of drool on the corner of my mouth . . . I find his use of color and texture mind blowing and exhilarating.   Phila was only place in U.S. for exhibit. Goes to Ottowa and then back to Netherlands. I think you're in Vancouver? Not around the corner, but in case you are travelling this summer, it will be May 25 - Sept 3 at the National Gallery of Canada. www.gallery.ca/en/about/1237.php ",

My hand and arm are still feeling very good. I swear good sleep makes a big difference for me. Husband took a bunch of things out of the house to have listed on eBay. Still focused on out clearing more. I am feeling much lighter without so much stuff, even if it was packed away in closets and drawers.

I know someone who is a member and I have already sent her a message explaining what we want to do and asked a few questions about setting up. Also looked at basic info on Pinterest after I sent request. I know we can all have separate boards with pinned pics and follow each other's, but it looks like there is a way to allow multiple users to pin to same board. Will see what I learn from friend and as I read more. This is a good idea, especially because each pic you pin has an associated link (i.e., UnderArmour site). When you pin pic you can add a brief description and price. When another member repins pic, the original link goes with it. Sounds very useful for our purposes. Pinterest is free and has no advertising as it is still developing. I got involved in researching and didn't respond to your excellent mileage today. Well done! Need to climb in bed so I get that sleep. It is already way too late!",

While it may feel like it has a life of its own at times, a name elevates it to something alien. It is hard to feel connected and at peace with a body that has changed so much because of BC and LE. Continuing to think of it as a whole entity is an affirmative attitude of your body with all its strengths and weaknesses. I understand you probably mean it as a humorous thing, but words are powerful. That arm needs all the love and kindness it can get, so if you do name it something, I hope you make it something encouraging and kind. Hang in there with caring for your father and you - can be difficult to do both at the same time. Train arrived three hours late last night. I crashed practically all the way home, napping throughout the day. In bed early and now off to appts for ME for a change! Be back later.",

Three weeks to see therapist and then time for garment to be altered? . . I think I would opt in favor of what is best for your hand since it has been so stubborn. If you continue to wrap, by the time you see your therapist your measurements will be consistent with the reduction you have attained and the garment can be altered to match appropriately. I would take the conservative route because you are more likely to know where your measurements will be in three weeks if you wrap. Not the easy answer, I know. I'm sure Binney and Kira will have some thoughts on this, and they know much more than I do when it comes to this kind of thing. I'm currently in a holding pattern for ordering my night sleeve because my measurements are up and I am traveling again next week. After I return, we are going to work diligently to get arm and hand where it was and then take measurements. Most likely this means I will have to wrap when I return, but I'll do what I need to do to get the right size garment. I'm so happy with my vest - I want the same experience with the sleeve/hand garment. I had instructional video with me on last trip to practice wrapping, but discovered no DVD player at condo, so I need to try now while I am home for a couple of days. Ideally, I should wrap for car ride vs waiting until I get home.  MLD with therapist Thurs and Fri. Have not hit the aerobic exercise after returning home. Yesterday it was 93, sunny, and humid. I parked my car in far away spots in parking lots while doing errands, but it was miserable walking to car and then getting inside fire-hot interior.  Awful weather, and I was swollen by the end of the day. I am still wearing my night vest. Doing things around house and out to A/C theatre to see movie tonight - nothing outside for now. Goodness, it is 105 in Knoxville today! Why in the world am I going there next week?!! Becky, I'm glad it's cooler where you are in FL!! ",

I discovered the lanolin in the Eucerin was giving me the rash. Duh, I know I used to get bumps from lanolin and avoided lotions, shampoos, etc with it. However, since I was told by my LE therapist to use when I wrap, I never thought to look at ingredients, as it has the right pH, yada, yada. Anyway, the rash appeared on my legs for a while before appearing on my arm, so I didn't connect it. Also, the dermatologist gave me (you got it!) lots of Eucerin samples and told me to moisturize more. I do not know why the shower seemed to intensify or cause further outbreaks, but since I have discontinued Eucerin for over a month I have not had an outbreak. And my other thought that it might be stress related can be dismissed, as I had a pretty stressful past two weeks with no rash. I'm back to using Lymphoderm and Nivea, and I am going to try the Vanicream. Just a little reminder to myself that I always need to be using my noggin!",

Had another day of moving and transporting things, which is good, but then I had to grocery shop to stock up for the approaching storm. That meant canned and jarred goods since our range runs on propane and we can use stove without power. No oven though. Unfortunately (or stupidly), since I was also getting all laundry done today, I did delicates and threw my sleeves and gloves in before I remembered I still needed to shop. So, of course, even with all the canned goods I felt the need to buy two pumpkins! By the time I lugged everything in the house and then threw the wet towels from washer into dryer, I knew I had overdone it. Water, deep breathing, brief MLD and now in bed with night garments. I am frustrated and feel slightly derailed from exercise. I know I will get back to it, as I am really missing the walking. Purple, I hope your knee feels better soon. I totally agree about the shoes being important. My back suffers when my shoes are not right.",

Sounds like work is super busy, but busy is good! Once things are under control, you will be pacing the airports and getting plenty of cardio. I think you mentioned a page or so back about modifying your routine for travel. Will be curious to hear how that works for you. I forget, but did I send you the \"friendly\" home routine I use? That works well for travel. The trainer I had to the house before my surgery set me up with that, and the exercises are slight variations to what I currently do. Let me know if you need/want it. Hope you husband is recovering from surgery and feeling well. It really does feel good to be on the giving end for a change. Our partners have been so kind! As for traveling solo, I am a little more tentative about where I get out to walk. When my husband is with me, we circle around a gas station or fast food joint multiple times if there are no sidewalks. That's fine, and I probably would do by myself, but at night or when I am in a busy area I feel the need to play it safe at times and don't get quite as much walking in. On the other hand, if I had grandbabies waiting to see me I would be inclined to press the pedal to the metal. If we don't cross paths before, I hope you and your family have a wonderful Thanksgiving!",

Ugh, I feel like I haven't been nearly as consistent as I planned. Trying not to berate myself because I know that sometimes life and swelling get in the way of weight training. It's part of living with LE, yes?? Please say yes!  Cindy, perhaps the increased amount of sitting at the hospital is cause of swelling? And STRESS, so if you were worried about your mother that could also be responsible. I try to remind myself to do extra deep breathing exercises during those times, as we tend to breathe more shallowly when stressed. Hope you are doing better today!",

I appreciate your comment, as it comes at a very good time since I've been getting a little lax and skipping my morning MLD. Good reminder - thanks!

I have been diligent with compression, and my new Assets by Spanx tank is really doing an excellent job on the side of my trunk and very comfortable. Internal shelf bra lies flat and elastic does not roll, bind or prevent LE flow. The arm holes are almost a little loose, which is a welcome relief since my other tanks cut just a tad at times. Extra long length doesn't ride up or bunch around tummy. Downside, because it has widely set straps and a slightly higher neckline and back, is that it is visible under certain tops. Could be more noticeable because it's white, and I normally would wear black or nude under tops I tried. I have yet to find a garment that is perfect for every outfit, so for the super comfort, I'll gladly add it to the rotation. I can't wear the same one everyday anyway, as some part will start to rub and bother me even if it's usually fine. On to the accountability part. I haven't done my steps or hilly walking for two days. I guess I should count my walk with my friend on Thurs, but it really wasn't aerobic. Half-ass with MLD, but doing node clearing, deep breathing, fist pumping several times a day. Not feeling like the bug, but things are rather chaotic right now and I haven't made the extra effort to allow time for proper MLD and exercise. I know I will get back on track - definitely still committed to good self care and exercise. I will probably do steps later tonight. Husband is arriving home this evening. Sorry to be popping in and out without commenting much on conversation, but I am glad to hear your procedure went well, Kira.",

Most tanks are like shapewear, some I believe insurance covers (others may weigh in here) but I have used the Maidenform Control-It, which can be purchased at Kohls or Macy's or online. I think Binney likes the Wearease CrissCross Shaper. There are many brands, but the key is what feels comfortable on you. I have been through a few styles and brands as my needs have changed. Many of us with truncal LE struggle to find a tank with an edge that doesn't cut in the wrong place (pressing on your \"bad spot\") which can irritate, make swelling worse, or just plain drive you crazy. However, a tank that fits comfortably will feel good because it provides support and coverage where it is needed. Generally, you will know right away when the fit is really wrong. We have had discussions on this forum about truncal LE and whether tanks might be better for some because there is no band that stops the flow of lymphatic fluid from the underarm area to the inguinal nodes near the groin area. Again, it's very personal, and what works for someone might not be right for another. When I had TEs, I wore tanks because I just couldn't get those things to fit in a bra. I didn't have LE then, but a tank was more comfortable. You mentioned your PS thought you may have LE, but you didn't say whether you were experiencing any symptoms or sensations such as an achey feeling, fullness, stinging, or burning. If you are uncomfortable, there is no harm in trying on a tank yourself. However, since you are just a week post-op, I might wait another week, as these things can be cumbersome to try on. I don't know if you have restrictions on how high you can raise your arms, but I remember I had a two-week period before I could raise my arms above my shoulders to allow the pockets to heal. Some of these tanks are stepped into, but squeezing in and out of these formfitting items might cause you to swell further. Your arms have to pull them up, and the garment can rub against incisions. I'd hang back another week before twisting yourself into a pretzel to test any shapewear!",

I do not know the answer to your question, but I am sure someone will come along and be able to help you. Hugz, where does one get these Nordic poles? Do you need a ski shop or regular sporting goods store? Can you describe the technique further, please? You're saying the elbow is never bent? How long are the poles? I don't know why, but I am picturing them being tall. Does using them put more stress on your trunk? I really like the idea of having a way to rest my hands while walking. I have zilch experience with skiing, so any comparison to ski poles will be over my head. Dawne, I try not to walk with my arms dangling, too, as I feel like it makes my hands swell a little. Sometimes it makes them feel better when I move them but keep them bent, like I am trying to walk fast and elbow someone out of my way. Like usual, there is no consistent behavior to my LE - it has been that way for my trunk, so I guess my arm also.",

Maybe I should say the stupid rash is kicking my butt and the LE is just joining in for fun! I have been able to wear my glove, as my hand still seems to not have rash at this point. Had tiny areas but they are gone. Dermatologist said that she now thinks that I have dry skin/ezema/dermatitis. I can't believe I did all that laundry for nothing!! Well, maybe detergent isn't totally rinsed out of clothing? She told me the only thing to be concerned about is if dry patch gets yellow crusty top. Ya think? She said with dry skin there can be these little micro cuts . . . yada yada yada . . I said I KNOW! That's why I was concerned about cellulitis! You guys understand how it is. She seems genuinely compassionate about my issue, but has no clue that I understand how this could affect my LE arm and increase potential for infection. Lotion, lotion, lotion, benedryl at night and zyrtec during the day, cortizone cream applied 2Xday. It is getting better but new areas popped up. I really find it hard to believe that I suddenly have developed a skin issue?  Well, I have not been able to wear vest and sleeve, no MLD until rash clears therapist said. I have not wrapped and not wearing tank. In spite of all of this, I was thinking earlier today that I feel pretty good. Tonight my arm is slightly aching, doing the barometer activity for rain tomorrow. I was very busy this past weekend, pretty exhausted by preparing and then hosting. I got a lot of sleep the last two evenings, and tonight I plan to get another heavy dose. This does me a world of good as far as swelling. So, while I haven't been doing a lot of physical activity - not sure running up and down the stairs would be good without sleeve or wrapping. Maybe I could get some walking in tomorrow if it doesn't rain all day? What's the worst that can happen - swelling? Whatever. I am just pleased my body has been behaving fairly well even with all the stress. I am in good spirits but taking a back seat right now with posting here. You know I love you guys! I'll be back on track soon and feel like checking in more. ",

      "Content": "Jul 9, 2012 12:24PM - edited Jul 9, 2012 12:39PM by Tina337 My goodness, where the heck is everyone??! Hugz, how are you doing? Carol, it sounds like you are doing great! I totally agree that the purpose of increasing strength through the PAL program is to decrease the likelihood of causing flares when doing everyday activities or moments of exertion. The idea of never lifting anything greater than five lbs is ridiculous. The less you use your muscles, the less it will take for something to cause a flare. I have always been a firm believer of the slow and steady increase in strength and aerobic endurance, which I believe is why I never injured myself in all the years I trained and participated in activities. I just want to reassure you about the chicken arm and muscle issue re proportion of sleeve. If you continue to exercise, I think you will eventually lose the chicken arm as you continue to lose extra fat. My personal experience after periods of inactivity is that I look thinner (scrawny - comparable to the chicken arms you describe). My weight is distributed differently because of the decrease in muscle and increase in fat. When I first start exercising and get to the point where a gain in muscle is visible, my clothes will begin to feel tight. However, once I keep going and the fat evaporates, I'm left with lean muscle which takes up less space. Clothes fit again but differently - in a very nice way! So, I think your arm will return to a greater proportion eventually. Of course, all of us have a unique build, and some will always have more muscle definition than others or tend to become bulkier. Can you recall your earlier years of fitness and shape of your arm then? Oh, and when I talk about proportion of muscle, I mean for those who are of average or high fitness vs body builders. One other thing I know about myself personally when it comes to muscle and fitness, is that I will look small and muscular, but I weigh between 7-10 lbs more than when I am a slug. Muscle weighs more than fat, so that's something else to consider. I always go by how my clothes feel and let the scale be a guide. It may be helpful at this point to keep measurements as well, as they will tell a different story than weight alone. I returned home last night from my TN trip, and I have to say that considering the lack of control I had at my friends' home and the extreme heat, I did very well. Except for one day, which was a decent 7,500 steps, I clocked over 10,000 or 11,000 steps a day the rest of my visit. While we allowed for two travel days going down, we only allowed for one going home. Normally a 10 1/2 hr trip, with seven walking stops it took 12 hrs. Although it was a longer drive time, I actually felt better during trip and upon arriving home than I normally do when we used to stop as little as possible (and I am referring to pre-BC travel as well). By the time we left the second to last stop, I had clocked over 10,000 steps, and just before midnight while unpacking I had 11,458!! That I did that during a 12 hr car trip amazes me. It was a real eye opener for my husband, who has a desk job. It convinced him that getting up every hour and walking for five min can make a big difference. I have to admit my legs and butt feel like I got a little workout yesterday. Even though it was dreadfully hot, we found small shady patches at rest areas. Sometimes I was walking in big circles . . I guess I have no more shame about how I look in public when it comes to my health. A couple of days while visiting with friends, I had to jog or walk inside the house to get my steps in. One night my friend was preparing dinner and since I didn't have any tasks, I stood there walking or jogging in place and talked with her. At first she thought I was a little goofy but soon got over it. By the way, I had such a wonderful time meeting Becky during my trip. We had lunch and got to talk for a long while. It is so nice to have a conversation with someone who speaks LE!!! With others I feel like I am explaining myself, much like a foreign language or culture. In LE, \"How are you?\" translates as \"How is your arm?\", but \"Do you wrap or wear compression?\" is socially acceptable! LOL!",

I find it hard to see others having fun when I can't (if exercise is fun), but it helps remind me there are ups and downs to living with LE and the down part isn't a permanent thing. Instead of thinking about exercise, I visited this thread and focused mainly on the self care part. I need support with consistently wearing my garments and doing MLD just as much as exercise! If you change your goals to reflect what is important to your health right now and check off accomplishments and compliance each day, you will know you are making progress. I think the key is to break things down into doable goals for where you are: post surgery, newly diagnosed LE, a flare, or things like cellulitis, broken bones, sprains, etc. And, yes, these things have happened to a number of us here! Nibbana, I'm sorry about the wrapping and $$ for LE stuff. I noticed on your \"Fine Line\" thread that you were wondering about exercise. I think while you are having active swelling that weight training needs to wait for now. However, cardio is good for helping with swelling, but since it takes less to overtax a lymphatic system that is already struggling, it's best to start out easy. Try a short distance of walking and see if it causes swelling that doesn't go down after MLD and extra hydration. If it doesn't, then you can try adding a little more distance. The key is not getting too gungho when your body is still trying to stabilize. There is a gal here who even walks wrapped or wearing her night garment, so having a flare or swelling doesn't have to mean no activity. But you are right that it is hard to find that fine line between productive exercise and doing too much and causing swelling. I think it's harder to find the balance right after diagnosis because the body hasn't been retrained with consistent MLD to move fluid in new pathways. As time passes, it does get easier, and you will be able to \"read\" where your body is and what's too much and what is right. After things stabilize you can experiment more with pushing that boundary. That's where I am right now, and I am trying to be so careful and not overdo. I keep reminding myself to think long term, and that means small steps vs giant strides of improvement. I can't recall if you have a LE therapist? Here is a link to finding a LANA certified therapist, which is the gold standard for training. It's a good place to start. I have also inserted a link to the StepUp-SpeakOut, a website that has a lot of good info on LE. I found it very helpful when I was first diagnosed. www.clt-lana.org/therapists/de... www.stepup-speakout.org/ Dawne, I am so glad to hear you have made it out the other side. I would love to hear about your training for the 6k and how you left the Land of Flare while still exercising. It's time for me to see if I can walk now or have to wait for the sun to start to set. It has been so humid, but I am resisting going to the gym. Nothing is as good as the hills by my house. They kick my a$$. With the weather this past week, I have dialed down the mileage, but my goal today is to do somewhere between 3.5 - 5 mi without overheating and swelling. Come on, Fall!",

(stirring in the cream on top. . . oh! where was I?) I have Kashi biscuits for breakfast if I am not doing a yogurt and fruit smoothie. I eat the cereal with whole or lowfat organic milk. I will have a couple spoonfuls of yogurt during the day if I feel the need to snack but don't have something handy. I will eat cheese occasionally or with (gasp!) a hamburger or sandwich. I have wondered if this has anything to do with swelling as I thought I noticed a change a couple of times when I didn't eat my regular breakfast a few days in a row. Hmm, maybe this is an experiment I need to try as well, but the idea of giving up my yogurt totally is not appealing. I definitely would be willing to limit my consumption if it makes a difference. Heck, who knows, if it made that big of a difference, I might make a 180 in my dietary habits. Thank you for being the nagging reminder about this!!  Carol, the whole sleeve thing is a freakin' mystery to me. You've seen my little twig arms. How in the world can an off-shelf Jobst sleeve not fit me? Before my arm swelled at all, I considered the sleeves claustrophobic and uncomfortable for flying. Once my forearm swelled, that sleeve became downright painful. However, I never could have worn those sleeves full time even when my arm was fine. I would get to a point where they made me feel crazy even though they fit fine. The custom sleeve definitely feels like a better fit, but it still binds a little in the elbow. If I am walking outside when it is hot, I do not wear my sleeve and glove. I have the okay to do this from my therapist because my arm is considered stable. It's either wear the sleeve and glove, get overheated, swell and spend the night managing the swelling, or I go without and stay cooler while walking and then come home and manage the smaller amount of swelling. I opt for the latter. When I eventually can lift weights, I definitely will wear my sleeve and glove. So, yes, it really is a trial and error thing. The heat messes with the fit, and I guess if you are fighting off any small flare, then your arm could be more sensitive. I am like Dawne in the sense that pre-BC my hands and feet swelled when I got warm or overheated in hot weather. I don't think I swell any more than I did, but if I am flaring, the extra swelling makes that area painful, especially if it is enough to slightly change the fit of the sleeve.",

I attribute part of my successful deconstruction surgery to all the work I had done for a year leading up to it. I went a few times after the implants were gone to make sure everything healed without any adhesions. Funny thing, I had a spot in my back that had \"gone out\" 10 yrs ago when I bent over the tub to dry my leg, and I ended up on the floor and could not get up. That took a while to heal, and I had gone to the chiropractor and had massage. Even years later during a massage, whenever they ran their hands down the length of my spine, when they got to that one area I would almost jump off the table. After the myofascial release I experienced in the process of working on my chest, shoulders and back, that spot on my back is completely gone. Visits to my chiropractor were only a temporary fix, whereas the myofascial has been permanent. I no longer feel the need for an \"adjustment\" because the muscles and tissue supporting my spine are now relaxed. It is such an unusual experience when you first start - you get a real sense of how everything is interconnected. For example, one time the therapist was working on my abdomen just below my ribcage, and I felt sensations in my neck and pectoral area, and sometimes you could even see things twitch. Weird, but wonderful! Sorry I haven't reported in the last few days, but it's not because of slacking. I've actually been good and walked the past four days - three miles, five miles, three miles, and last night two miles. We had a pot luck dinner at friends' house yesterday, arriving around 4pm. I brought my walking clothes because I knew we would be there until about 10pm. I announced early on that I was planning to walk after dinner if anyone wanted to join me, and the husband of the couple, my husband and I took a walk. The dog came along, too. Thank goodness our friends are low key like us and go with the flow. I was pleased I got a walk in for the day. I've also been doing my MLD at least once a day and wearing the night garments when I feel the need. Lots of water, too. I think I am on a roll. My husband complimented me on how I have been more active lately, which I really appreciated hearing. I told him I was very pleased, too, but I worry about getting too excited because I don't want to slip into \"gungho\" mode because that is dangerous territory for me. I am on a slow and deliberate track and it seems to be paying off.",

The application Bob made on my behalf for a second level insurance appeal was so well written and had all kinds of supporting documentation. And, he uses the prosthetic device strategy for insurance appeals as well. We are so lucky that Bob is willing to do this, and we should take advantage. It's free, but as a thank you you can always donate to the NLN and their work for legislative change regarding LE coverage. It can be stressful to appeal insurance or Medicare on your own, but Bob's involvement helps relieve that. If anyone has a chance of winning, it's him, so you can feel you've done all you can to get your garment covered. And you do deserve that coverage.",

I still have my arm and hand wrapped, and I am also wearing my compression tank with round swell spots on each side in the underarm area 24/7 as per my LE therapist's instruction. This afternoon I did the entire Lebed DVD. Woohoo! It's a start. Yes, that DVD is still creepy! I'll have you know I continued with the exercises even when my husband unexpectedly walked into the room. I started making fun of the DVD, which was kind of fun, so I continued for the rest of the program taunting and making fun of the weird instructions, cheers, and \"dancing!\", etc. It actually made me feel more powerful and in control, and I liked that! \"Life isn't about finding yourself, life is about creating yourself.\" ~ George Bernard Shaw Dx 11/13/2007, DCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

In my early 30's after moving to PA, I went back and took friends who had never heard of these places. I later returned with my husband to show him Pt. Pleasant and we spent the day there. I have only seen brief clips of the stupid TV show, and in no way did they capture my experience or memory of the area. I am glad you are safe and have heat and power again. I will be thinking of you and hope the coming storm has minimal impact. Compliance with self care, but no exercise to report. I still am moving things around the house, carrying things out to car and organizing. I hope that counts for something, but I haven't worn my pedometer the last few days.

I found I actually do better exercising when I travel - go figure that!! I clocked some major mileage while in TN. Anyway, I am now home, hanging in there and doing well. One of the things I have been working on is trying to find a balance between regular doses of emotional support from these forums and trying to resume/begin activities in a way that reconnects me to my life before BC. No, the LE symptoms haven't gone totally away, but I have found that with my goal to relax and find balance that I feel less stressed, which helps keep my LE in check. So, it's kind of weird, learning to know when to forget about the elephant in the room and realize I can manage later, or sensing that I need to stop and regroup. It is a delicate, high wire act, my friends. I know this is nothing new for many of you, especially those of you who work multiple jobs or have multiple roles, but it is for me. I had become so worn down by the events of the past few years that it was challenging to meet each day with enthusiasm, let alone accomplish many tasks. I was on survival mode, but I am slowly trying to move back into full-swing. Taking on greater responsibilities around the house, brushing up my resume and preparing to look for a job. It's a big deal, and I am proud of myself. Self care and exercise are critial and will always come first, but with stability I feel the need to try and regain some self reliance. The art therapy group I attended for three years (which helped me cope with chronic pain, the failed implant recon and development of LE) ended back in spring and my schedule has prevented me from attending a local monthly BC support group. So I have been been working without a net lately! Instead, I am immersing myself in old hobbies and art. I have reconnected with photography and plan to purchase a new camera so I can resume challenging and losing myself in this activity again. I have also been contemplating sewing projects and gathering materials, researching the construction of items I plan to create. I haven't drawn much since my arm and hand swelled, but I am hoping to begin this again, too. Finally, I have made serious headway with clearing out my home, which has given me a greater sense of being in control. I have even more bags of clothing and household items to consign, and it feels good to let go of what no longer fits in the house or on my body. While there are definite hands-on and immediate steps to self care, I am currently embracing the kind of self care that nurtures my soul. I miss being in touch with all of you every day, but you are always in my heart!! I think of you when I walk and lift those weights!! ",

I still have my arm and hand wrapped, and I am also wearing my compression tank with round swell spots on each side in the underarm area 24/7 as per my LE therapist's instruction. This afternoon I did the entire Lebed DVD. Woohoo! It's a start. Yes, that DVD is still creepy! I'll have you know I continued with the exercises even when my husband unexpectedly walked into the room. I started making fun of the DVD, which was kind of fun, so I continued for the rest of the program taunting and making fun of the weird instructions, cheers, and \"dancing!\", etc. It actually made me feel more powerful and in control, and I liked that! \"Life isn't about finding yourself, life is about creating yourself.\" ~ George Bernard Shaw Dx 11/13/2007, DCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I liked being shown the equipment, proper seat settings, free weight exercises and good form, and then I would go about it at my own pace. I have increased weights, time on aerobic equipment very slowly, much more slowly than my friends do. And when I have taken a break (ok, fallen off the wagon), I started back very carefully and slowly. I was all about proper form. As a result, after working out at gyms for over 25 yrs, I never had an injury, but I was fit as a fiddle and strong! My husband tried to work out with me as a guest a couple of times and said I was brutal. Well, I had slowly worked up to that level of intensity, and I guess it showed eventually. So now, when I just go out for a walk with friends - those that are out of shape now and have had only a few periods of their life when they were fit - they really push me to go faster and longer than I would do on my own. Their 'come on, Tina,' really annoys me. And the days I have done a too fast and too long a distance with them, my feet will hurt or I will get blisters, or my back might get tight. So, it's no fun for me to exercise with most people. I have always been in touch with my body and known its limits and prefer to stay in my own \"zone\". Right now I have been suffering from a lack of motivation as far as more difficult exercise. I am not quite as sure of my body as I used to be. I have been really baby stepping it - back to my mantra of 'slow and steady wins the race' - and I am doing fine and having only a couple of flares (which I think were more weather related). I will observe thoughts I have while exercising, that I wish I were like I used to be (I am tearing up as I write this), but then I bring myself back to the present and remind myself that I will eventually get there. The goal is health, and that changes as one ages even if you haven't had surgery and LE. It's still frustrating as hell, though, for someone who really loved to be fit, to have these worries and have to learn how my new body responds to what it is asked to do, even in a gentle way. Oh, and with the PAL study workout I do, I increase the weight more slowly than the trainer would have me do. I have all these different parts of my body that are out of shape or not working optimally for different reasons. I see no need to work out my lower body like there's no tomorrow while the core and top are lagging behind. Besides, IMO, just like inflammation from sickness or injury in another part of the body can cause a flare, I think that's true for exercise. So, you could say that I am looking to exercise my whole body in a balanced way. I haven't been doing yoga, but I am listening to and respecting my body as I try to progress.",

Worried it would feel unlevel where it ends when lying on back or side but I don't notice at all. Oh, and much easier to put on instead of fighting with tank and inserts. Check out my avatar! :-)",

Traffic was horrible during the last few hours of the drive, and I napped in the back seat. Back felt a little funky the following two days and I took ibuprofen. Got about 5,000 steps those days. Yesterday I was out all day running errands and wore shoes with heels. Felt okay most of the time, but by evening my back was really unhappy. When I got home, I was ready to put on pjs and stretch. Major spasms continued and I took one of my few remaining pain pills. Hardly touched the pain but helped me get to sleep. Woke up during night and husband had to get ibuprofen and I took some Valium. I slept for almost 12 hours and feel a bit better today. I think walking later will help loosen things. Not going to do anything strenuous, but I feel the need to move. I fear the inactivity will cause me to swell, and I have been doing so well with that. I know when I get 10,000 steps at least several times a week, my hand, arm and chest feel and look great. I am wedded to activity and cardio, as I have witnessed the obvious difference in my body since I began walking regularly this summer. Walking and water are key for me as much as MLD and compression. I am now somewhat off track with the weights and need to chill. That train stops regularly; I know I will get back on soon. :-) It's always something, isn't it?",

Of, course, I'm talking about the more intense levels that you and Becky are doing. A nice walk each day is great - those 10,000 steps. But Nordy put it well in her post about knowing when to take a break if you listen to your body. I can remember that I would lift weights every other day, no matter what day of the week it was. Never missed. I would do cardio at least five days a week. Once in a while I would reach a plateau and wonder why I couldn't seem to push forward. A day off often produced a much more powerful workout, just like Becky's today. I used to freak out when I went away on vacation and didn't have access to a gym, go to all sorts of lengths to find one. If I couldn't, then I would do more cardio. However, there were a few times when my husband and I took some road trips, and it was impossible to plan or even predict where we would be. I thought when I returned home I would be weaker, but, nope, it actually helped, which was probably a sign I pushed myself too much. So, I eventually didn't get freaked out when I took vacations and couldn't do my usual workouts. Finally realized it wasn't often that I got to see amazing cities, museums, parks, and nature, so why was I driving myself nuts about getting in a workout? It was partly fear that I would lose my motivation, especially if I was really in a good spot before I left. All I had to do when I got home was to start again and I was fine. I guess I should mention that I wasn't on a weight loss program, nor did I have body image/health issues. I was just a regular workout junky that loved the feeling (also the meditative quality) and it always kept me mentally and emotionally in a good space.",

Last night I noticed my forearm has swollen more than it had been, my hand as well. New spots on both. Ugh! Should I have NOT exercised yesterday? I thought the breathing aspect of it would be helpful. I was unusually winded and tired more easily, so maybe not.",

So, it's made to handle the dryer, and the tennis balls help puff up the garment. It takes two very long cycles to dry that darn thing! I see major changes in my propane, electric and water bills!

Okay, bikini - are you trying to hurt me?  LOL!! That does sound like a flattering look for a flat chest though. Maybe if it were part of a tankini top or one piece I would wear. Doesn't it hurt if top is tight enough that it won't fall down? I am concerned about my bathing suits cutting in on the truncal area, which is the issue I have with finding shapewear or compression camisoles. I'll let you guys know what works after I finish packing. I am trying to do a little bit at a time.  On the down side, I got the results from my mother's swallowing test. She failed, as anticipated. Interesting info. I spoke quite a while with the speech therapist and then social worker. There will be a care meeting next week while I am there to discuss pros and cons of feeding tube. ",

The train was my favorite part of the trip, gave me time to relax and take my mind off things. My pedometer must be so confused, as I had days with over 11,000 steps, and the last couple were so low. When we got in my friend's car at the station tonight, I looked at my pedometer and burst out laughing because it was a ridiculous number: 697 steps all day. Kind of hard to get those steps in on the train. Tomorrow I will be on target. I have really noticed that cardio, or just not sitting around as much, makes a big difference in swelling.",

I guess she would be considered Americana, but her songs and albums are diverse in style. Her band did a Loretta Lynn tribute album, and she will take on a variety of cover songs and make them her own. However, she is also a terrific songwriter, has a love of honkytonk, rockabilly, and her tunes waft in and out of jazz, blues and country. I just adore her voice and enthusiasm. Her newest album is Queen of the Minor Key. Oh, and she and the members of her band are also part of a larger band, the Sacred Shakers, that performs gospel songs that rock out. My own taste in music is all over the map. I really enjoy an assortment of music styles depending on my mood. I am a rock 'n roll gal at heart but love Americana music and how it melds a variety of styles and creates something new and fun. Becky, it must be very hot and humid by now, even in the early morning. What has allergy season been like this year?",

Everyone's insurance co is different (even if it's the same company but a different state or location in state), but if they pay for any of your compression garments, WELL!!! that may be your case. I ended up with Mr. Bob Weiss as my lymphedema advocate who represented me at a second level appeal with my insurance co. He was awesome!! Does it for free because each case he wins helps set a precedent for legislative changes. My lymphedema therapist had ordered vest and my doctor wrote prescription. Insurance co would not preauthorize, and my doc called and spoke with medical director. He maintained no precert, and she told me to appeal. I did and lost first level appeal. As Mr. Weiss says, you will always lose first level appeal. That's when he's willing to step in, at the second level. He knows his stuff, too. I had to gather a few items for him, but he really did the rest. The appeal was done via conference call since he's in CA and I am in PA, and the committee was in Phila. Even though I could have attended in person, I did not because I don't look like anything is wrong with me. I let Mr. Weiss take care of everything, and the only thing I had to do was describe the kind of makeshift garments I wear to control the truncal LE, and why they are not as effective as the vest would be. And I will tell you that in my experience, they are not as effective as the vest. Let me find the link about the battle to get my vest approved. Here it is: http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/64/topic/774974?page=1 Oh, and for the gals with breasts or implants, the night vests are custom and can be made to accommodate all kinds of bumps in the front. I was going to have one made when I had implants, but once I decided to deconstruct, I held off so I wouldn't have to modify it. Mr. Weiss' basic premise for the purpose of lymphedema garments is that they are the equivalent of a prosthetic device. If you ever need the articles that Binney and Kira mentioned sending for appeal, I have them saved as word docs and can forward to you in email.  For a makeshift garment, I also used large pieces of orange foam my therapist cut that ran from my underarm area and up and behind it. The length was to to bottom of ribcage. I had one for each side and I bought a larger size shapewear tank and would insert those. The orange foam was more aggressive than the swell spots, but slightly less comfortable for sleeping. I have several variations of these getups. I found that even if you only need a swell spot for one side, if you wear one on both sides, it helps to minimize the pressure on the implants/breasts. There's something about the equal pressure that makes for better comfort as well. Even though I didn't need a full length vest for anything except my right side of underarm area (and very occasionally the left), the overall compression is more effective. Less whack-a-mole!!",

Carol, my husband is very good about my LE most of the time, but he did get a little testy yesterday at one point. The main thing I need to do to make the drive/walk thing a success is to be ready to leave earlier in a.m., which is certainly not too much to ask. How long does it take you to get to Columbus from MI?",

We tend to breathe more shallowly when stressed, more from the chest vs belly. I took a 8 wk mindful meditation class after my initial surgeries, and I saw a difference in how I felt. Since then I started using my drawing as a form of meditation. In the beginning I used for pain control, but I noticed it also helped with stress and working through emotional issues/frustrations (like my stupid insurance co appeal!) Dawne, I will second you on the MLD, but I wish I were more consistent. My therapist says that just doing the trunk makes a big difference, but she hates to say that because it's ideal to do the whole routine. Her point is if I am thinking of skipping, doing the trunk is much better than nothing. If you don't mind, can we talk more about your exercise during the flare? Are you saying you limited your exercise to the pool? Totally skipped walking and/or running? If it had been cooler, would you have continued to walk/run at all? I am curious to know how others handle this. The pool is definitely excellent for LE, especially during a flare, and you were really smart to use that as a tool. I am glad to hear you are back on track. I have also found that focusing on loss makes one feel frustrated, so it sounds you have a good mindset about this. Not that you're never frustrated by it, but you try and put it in perspective. Carol, I noticed you had posted somewhere that your arm was aching all day but no swelling. I had planned to ask you if that was your \"normal\" feeling, as I am still trying to know what my \"normal\" feeling is. I consider frequent or constant achiness a sign that I am not completely under control. Well, with the exception of when I walk. I will swell a little, but if I stay hydrated before and after and do MLD later, by bedtime the swelling is usually gone. In the morning I am fine. This is not to say I don't have any swelling. I do occasionally, but if it responds and goes away after MLD and doesn't have that flare feeling, I consider myself \"stable\".",

As far as affecting my sleep, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. I think it's more likely to effect my sleep if I'm already having trouble getting/staying asleep, which I seem to have problems with periodically. I can't say enough good things about these garments. Someone here was wearing her sleeve while walking (KS1?), but I think it would be rather warm. Probably no worse than wrapping. By the way, there are finger spacers inside hand area.

Gathered items, scanned and mailed, typed messages, made phone calls. Another conference call tomorrow morning, but it looks like things are advancing to next step. Anyway, stressed and a little swollen tonight. We know all about that, right Dawne?! I was going nonstop from 7:30am to 6:00pm and my brain and body were fried. I almost bailed on evening walk, but my husband said he had planned that as part of his exercise today and convinced me to go. So glad I did, as it helped provide a much needed break and gave me a little more energy to complete one final task so I could sit down and eat dinner by 8:00. One gripe I have is that I forgot to buy more Zyrtec, and after going without for three days my allergies are crazy. I think it's partly responsible for my swelling. Tomorrow after my conference call I am immediately going to the store to buy more Zyrtec! Took a benedryl and hopefully that will help. Enough complaining and on to my exercise report. Walked 3.5 miles and clocked just under 10,000 steps. Drank water and did several half-hearted sessions of abdominal breathing but I am blowing off the MLD and night garments tonight. Geez, it's almost 2:30, and I desperately need to sleep. Now if I can just stop sneezing!!",

Currently traveling to FL by car. Yesterday was day 1, and my husband and I stopped every hour for a 5-10 min walk. At hotel I walked on treadmill and ended the day with over 12,000 steps on pedometer. Wanted to use the pool but not enough time. On the road again today, arriving in FL tonight. Brief MLD, lots of deep breathing, drinking plenty of water. We brought our own food and snacks and I have a handle on the sodium. Although I did have an omelet at the hotel for breakfast which had some kind of cheese whiz. Yuck! Hope the outdoor pool at condo is open and water warm enough to use. Have my hand weights in trunk of car and ready for PAL routine. Happy exercising and self care, ladies!",

Therapist warned me it would loosen up as day passed, the bandages themselves and the decrease in swelling would tend to make them looser. Happened a couple times today, and I successfully fixed. However, tonight after fixing, palm by wrist started bothering me, and I should have taken bandages off then. A little later palm by fingers felt funny, which was different place than other day. I really wanted to last with bandages until appt tomorrow morning, but I knew something wasn't right and took them off. Looks like fluid had been pushed into hand. Lesson learned, let bandages be or remove when they get too loose - especially since I don't know what I am looking at with all those layers at this point. So, I put my glove and sleeve on for a while, and now I am removing and going to do MLD before going to sleep. Hope I get some wrapping training tomorrow, as it does seem to have helped my arm. Sally, the tank I wear is similar to Binney's, Maidenform's \"Control It\". I looked and couldn't find my round shape on the Swell Spot page, so I pulled it out and looked at the label, and it's a Jovipak. Same concept, different brand. Binney, I just tuck them inside the tank and when I visit the bathroom, I check and adjust as necessary. Mine don't seem to shift around so much.",

I plan to include my BCO name on my name tag in case there are other members attending. I am hoping that once I develop a consistent exercise routine that my LE will subside a bit. I want to be like Becky and reduce mine to stage 0! Speaking of exercise, I intentionally stayed across the river and have to walk about 11/4 miles to the Four Seasons tomorrow, which means I will get in at least 2 1/2 miles tomorrow. Hopefully more since we'll probably walk around Georgetown. Please tell me more about the indoor walking DVD, ladies. MLD in morning and evening with lots of node clearing, deep breathing, fist pumping during car ride. Short break to walk and stretch midway. Lots of water and found fairly decent food without too much salt. Compression all day and tonight. Feel better upon arriving today than I did after packing last night.",

I enjoyed running and hiking, and my husband always would complain that I walked too fast. I went hiking with a boyfriend years ago, and he said to me at one point, \"Do you ever look around while you're hiking?\" I did, but I had a natural rhythm/pace I needed to find to get in the \"zone\" and then I loved seeing what was (zooming) past me. I was fascinated by that feeling of being \"at one\" with my body in motion, if that makes any sense. Now I am out of shape, and I have this inner fear about pushing too much. As much as I do like to move, when I have gone through periods of inactivity I have found it difficult to get myself back into the habit. So, part of my issue in recent time has been lack of motivation, and not knowing how much is the right amount to push myself. One thing I have on my side is that when I had been inactive for a period, I always gradually worked myself back into shape. Never was into forcing my body to do things it wasn't able to do at the time, so as much as I had exercised I never injured myself once. Thank goodness that's the focus of the PAL protocol. For now, I am working on walking and increasing distance, and will then focus on increasing aerobic level. I'm getting my muscles to remember how to move right now! The motivation issue is why I appreciate the company here!",

I had new swelling in that area when my arm was flaring the other week, and it's still is not completely gone. Very uncomfortable. I observed that when I wore one of my more flattering garments (naturally) and did more walking than usual, that the armhole kind of rubbed and irritated the area. I'm back to wearing my tried-and-true garment except for shorter periods where I am less active. Since you've been jogging more lately, which often involves some natural movement in that area even if you're keeping your arms from swinging broadly, have you noticed a certain garment might be rubbing more than others? The fact that I am concave in the breast area from the expanders/implants and have some extra skin and slightly loose muscle above the incision works against the natural flow of the lymphatic pathway. I discovered the other day while doing MLD that I had an area of skin in the concave part that was a tad adhered and did some gentle myofascial release and it let go. The area drained within 10 min. I was shocked and asked my therapist about it. She said that was great. I wondered if chest adhesions like this are something I will always have to watch for, or whether this was still part of my healing from last year's deconstruction surgery. She told me poor posture can cause new adhesions and that I'd always need to watch for that. Ugh. Just another reason to strengthen our back muscles. Hang in there! ((((Binney))))",

My house is old and has low ceilings so no way could I use rebounder. (Did you just get an image of my head going through the ceiling?!) I was so excited when I heard about using the ball because that is perfect for me. I put both of my arms out straight above my head when I do it. I can't say whether it makes a difference or not. It feels good, and I assume you're getting some core exercise since you have to stabilize yourself while bouncing. I wish I could count this as core exercise, but I don't. :-/ I don't have any experience with using the rebounder, but I think it's best on your joints if you bounce without feet actually leaving the ground (the center fabric of small trampoline).",

Note to self: Remove compression tank before wrapping arm! The other thing I wanted to mention is that after wearing the vest last night my chest looked much better this morning. I can't believe I had to fight my insurance co to get a garment that I clearly needed and my policy covered.",

I do think you have the right idea to practice a portion at a time. Less frustrating. My therapist had said I could try that way, but on the other hand, I really needed to have the whole arm wrapped for best results. Kind of forced the issue.

I think I am ready to start again once my compression garments are rewashed. My arm is actually 10% smaller than it had been - it is now 1% smaller than my good arm! Yes, Carol, at its worst, my LE arm had been 9% larger. Then it was down to 6% larger after 2 days of wrapping 24/7 and several MLD appts. Being compliant with regular sleeve/glove and MLD, then custom sleeve/glove, wrapping and vest for a week were what did the rest. However, my hand still had some swelling, and I asked therapist to compare those measurements to last two, and that area is larger. I woke up this morning with that part swollen, and I think it was due to my poor coverage of part of hand when wrapping last night. I took the hand bandage with me and had her bandage my hand over my glove from the angle I would see and do it. I think that clarified everything finally. Reciting these numbers out loud makes it pretty clear that because I am thin, not all LE professionals, even a well respected expert, will be able to recognize a 9% difference in my arm and hand. Thank goodness my LE therapist knows my body well and has the attitude that this difference is huge for me and takes it quite seriously. Ah, good therapists are worth their weight in gold!",

However, I have been moving around, going up and down the stairs all day. I have done a lot and still feel good. Definitely taking breathers, going easy on repetitive movement. I have shredded tons of paper, and I think my house might float away with that gone! I finally got a big chunk of paperwork done for my mother's finances, which is a big relief. One more big hurdle, then two small ones, and I should be home free.  Mom is being quite testy with the PT's, arguing and refusing to do exercises at times. It is unfortunate, and I was feeling if I were there she might be doing better. My husband reminded me she does what she wants to do, and that certainly is true. She runs a good racket, as my aunt visited yesterday and had her convinced she was up and around and running marathons.  Making train reservations this weekend to visit with her. I will be curious to compare this experience with flying and driving. Will take 24 hrs but we will have small private room. I am going to wear my pedometer and see how much I can walk on train! ",

It is calling to me, but without proper compression on my arm, I fear big problems. I don't know, you seem to just do and then deal, and I wouldn't be doing anything near a hundred miles. Maybe a short ride without compression would be better than no ride? I can hear my therapist yelling at me on that thought, as it goes against all exercise instructions with LE! I am leaving for FL, and while there I will have access to my 1968 women's Schwinn, 3 speeds, upright handlebars. Perhaps I can take a little cruise on that? Hugz, hope your mom is feeling better. At least with a cast on her foot she will have to refrain from climbing ladders to dust! Sounds like she has a lot of will, which is great, but knowing when to stop is something she is going to have to consider. My aunt was just telling me she was exhausted from having family visit with her for a couple of weeks. They were going nonstop. Her doc said she needs to understand it takes longer to bounce back, things will tire her more in her mid-80s. Still, it must be hard to hear that or have to scale back expectations. KC, sounds like you had a fun trip. Love the kinesiotape, but haven't used in a while. Glad it worked for you. Still fiddling' with Pinterest. Have to initially hook up account through Facebook of twitter but then can remove connection. Don't want to connect to my personal FB account or use private email, so I am creating another personal account using different address since it is temporary thing. Will keep you posted. Doesn't sound that difficult.",

Heh, heh, Ms. Becky thinks she's going for a fun walk up the monster hill, little does she know she will be pulling me along in the exercise wagon while I hold on for my dear life!! Nordy, thanks for the firm reminder that I need to wear compression when I go biking. Will do. Rash was on my upper arm, and the friction/tightness of sleeve was bothering me. I did wear sleeve the other day and it didn't make it worse. Last night I received my new custom beige sleeve and glove, so I am going to try on today and check fit. So glad it arrived in time for travel!! ",

I will go back in a month because my mother will need to give up her room in assisted living and become permanent resident of health center. Will need to see what gets moved where. We elected to go the no feeding tube route, despite some pressure to do it. Interesting to see how both clinical and personal views played a role in push for tube. Primary reason we decided against was mom said she didn't want it, her advanced directive said no extraordinary measures, and I didn't want her to have it unless she wanted it. I wasn't keen on the tube anyway. Bottom line was it wouldn't work without her cooperation, and I wasn't going to force her. My mother has always enjoyed eating, and I wasn't going to take away the last thing she has that gives her both pleasure and structure to the day. It's been hard enough to get her to cooperate with getting out of bed, doing PT, letting them change her diaper. She was independent with all of these things before hip fracture. She definitely is also declining mentally and seems more confused, less like herself. She is one angry bird and not winning any friends among staff, unfortunately. Her feistiness has always been something that kept her going, but it was mostly in check except for arguing over showers. Now it seems there's not much of a filter. I told her to be nice to staff, listen and follow their instructions. She pretty much agreed so I would shut up, although she did seem to be concerned when I described the kind of skin breakdown and sores she could get from not changing diaper or staying in bed too long. I had some very nice visits and talks with her about friends, family, other random stuff, but after being there a week, she got grouchy with me. Well, not really grouchy, but tired of talking and visiting. I needed a break, too, so I don't blame her. The day we left, she was raising holy hell, and when I came to say goodbye, there were three aides in her room to change her diaper, the bed, and get her into wheelchair. We went out into hall and talked a bit, and I gave her one final reminder about behaving and being careful with feeding herself. When I had said my peace, I told her I was done being bossy because I know she is going to do what she wants. I also said I wasn't going to worry anymore (which I had been saying during my visit). She said \"thank you\" (like she was thinking, thank goodness). This made my husband laugh, and I told her that it takes a lot to make my husband laugh, so she should be pleased with herself. She smiled and acknowledged. We sat quietly, some awkward gaps of no conversation, and I finally said it was probably time for me to be on my way. Well, her whole face lit up with a big smile, and she said that was great. I asked if she was going to head back down the hall, and said, no, she would wheel herself with us to the door. LOL! Talk about glad to see me go!! I just laughed and told my mom she was a piece of work, and she continued to smile. My mom, my husband, and I realized just how funny this was. We said we loved each other and goodbye. I have to tell you, if that was the last time I saw my mother alive, I will be so okay with it. That is my mother in a nutshell!!",

And that is especially true for outdoor exercise during summer. I really need to get myself in bed earlier and refrain from jumping on computer in middle of the night when I wake up. I hate tossing and turning, so I immediately pop open iPad, which is actually more stimulating. I wonder about Hugz, too. Just not the same without our #1 cheerleader.

Did you have to pay out of pocket for your recon/revision surgeries this year because you haven't reached your deductible? Or for any LE treatment sessions? The sleeve is mastectomy/LE related and they can't impose a different deductible or coinsurance on that than anything else. Maybe I am missing something, and I am sure you are familiar with your policy, but it seems to be a standard thing that policies cover a sleeve every six months. You may have a copay though. Yay, for dark chocolate! As long as it doesn't have negative consequences, I am eating it. If it happens to be helpful, then all the better.",

I felt that way with my foot injury, even though I knew it was temporary. Speaking of that foot, I think it is pretty much 100%, and I need to stop worrying and give it a whirl. Does bicycling hurt your hip the same way walking does? The legs are moving, but perhaps it's smoother and less jarring to hip? I know we have mentioned swimming, but bicycling can provide a similar meditative quality as walking. Feel better - hugs to you, Hugz.",

I wonder if being thrown back and forth while walking in the train counts as extra steps??",

I had problems with my back that were chronic, especially one area I turned a certain way to dry my leg after shower. I ended up on floor and couldn't get up. Chiro, massage, both provided a temporary fix. When I started to go to myofascial guy for my recon scars, I was having back, neck and shoulder issues because of the weight of the implants. Anyway, he worked on my back a lot to get my shoulders right, but in the process of doing my whole back, all of my old injuries and pains went away. I couldn't believe if, but they are gone. A fall, trauma or injury, surgical scar can cause problems. I am a total fan, well, at least of my therapist. I don't let him work on LE problem areas without telling me first what he's going to do. That way I feel safe and teach him more about my body and LE. He is gentle and respectful. Wish I could go for several hours and have him work on my legs, lower stomach. I got increased LE flow from scar release on implant//side of chest.",

Suddenly, I had this great thought, \"Hey, I feel pretty strong, I just picked these right up without any difficulty or weird muscle movements in my chest.\" I was all pleased with myself when I realized I had not one garment on, not even my tank. I had done MLD in a.m, so maybe that's why no ill effect. Or at least yet. All this rain is slightly playing games with my LE, but I am just not letting it get to me. I am trying not to freak at every little bit of swelling because I know it's so typical when I am here. This is a different reaction for me, so I am kind of interested by it, observing physical sensations and my emotional/cognitive responses.",

Yes, these changes in life can be difficult. I can relate to watching a parent have to adapt to a greater need for assistance. Can be difficult for parent to handle changes, and for you as well. It is a sense of loss for all. Your attitude with self care for LE can be a model for acceptance. I share with my mom about doing what needs to be done to keep my body healthy given the differences in how it used to be. She responds positively to this. I think it's sort of like our group here, knowing others are stepping up and taking control is encouraging and makes one feel not so alone.",

I had a cocktail, appetizer, flank steak salad, and ginger flan for dessert. On the way home I could already feel the back of my armpit buzzy and burny. Crappity crap. Can't one have a nice fancy pants dinner without being reminded of LE? I'm surprised it didn't come on sooner, actually. If I eat something salty, I feel it within an hour. Things like olives I will feel right away, so I am always guzzling water when I eat out, especially if I have alcohol. That's a double whammy. Oh, and the flank steak had a pretty spicey hot rub that was delicious. Spicey stuff does it, too. I love it, so I find it all very frustrating. Guess I need to get with the Leslie Sansone program. Carol, is there one you recommend trying first? The four in one DVD Ohio mentioned sounds like a bargain. Leaving for home tomorrow so I will have time to catch up on posts.",

I am getting very close to finishing a big chunk of work for her and will soon breathe a big sigh of relief. While doing that, I will try to log a decent amount of steps over the next few days. I can definitely tell the difference in my swelling and how I feel, so I am motivated to stay on track.",

The rest was all Mr. Weiss. It's easy to get through the first level appeal and denial. Anyone can do that.  FYI, here is the link from the StepUp-SpeakOut site to contact the Mr. Weiss. Scroll down to the section about Insurance appeals. He gives a little synopsis of the process. My process to win second level appeal was a one-shot deal and took about a month. Meanwhile, if I had known better, I wouldn't have gotten myself so worked up during the initial denial and first level appeal denial. Some of the women here have been successful at the first level appeal, so it is worth having your doc fax all the info. I was in an unfortunate situation with my doc leaving and her assistant being less than helpful, and I'm sure this didn't help matters.  www.stepup-speakout.org/Appeal...   I will have to take pics of pieces of foam and tank, maybe even model for old times sake. I have truncal LE on the side of my chest below the armpit, not in the breast area, so the foam lays just to the outside of the breast area, below the armpit and extends a little around back behind the armpit. Kind of like the side panel of a garment. They were inserted into a regular shapewear tank.  Meanwhile, here's the latest in my formal evening attire: http://i167.photobucket.com/albums/u145/tinasoldhouse/Whatnot/IMG_3998.jpg",

Someone would have to do the measuring for you, and I do not know if you can order directly from online distributor. You can pay out of pocket for them though. My insurance only covers a portion, and they tried to get out of paying for the night vest. I would have paid for them myself if I had to. They are the most wonderful garments I have and make a bigger difference than wrapping or any custom compression day garments I own. I think it's because they are less restrictive than a a compression sleeve or even a wrap. I think a sleeve/glove is around $500-600? Solaris is the brand I have and their night garments are called Tribute. They are excellent about making sure the garment fits well, and they will do a free modification within a year after purchasing. Jovipak is another brand that has a similar garment. I am wearing the Solaris vest in my avatar, but I think I posted a pic of my sleeve/glove combo on this thread when I received it. It looks like an oven mitt with a sleeve. The base part is comprised of foam chips that are sewn into channels. The channels help promote lymphatic flow in. There is also an outside jacket that can be worn over the base to provide additional compression. I prefer how mine feels with the outer jacket. Here's a link to Solaris' website and their line of Tribute night garments. My garment is the fingertips to axilla: solarismed.com/images/stories/...",

Plan to get completely back on track, as even with slacking a little I notice a difference in how I feel. I have been walking for a long enough time now that it is definitely a habit, so I am not feeling nervous in the service about missing a couple extra days. Will get completely back in line shortly!!

Carol has given you excellent information on how to start slowly and progress with weights and cardio, as either or the combination of both can provide a cartain \"load\" to your lymphatic system. Finding that initial starting point where you are doing some work but not causing swelling is key. After a period of stability in doing that level of execise, increase the weight or distance slowly. Remember to space out chores (such as weeding or scrubbing the tub) to days when you are less active, as these tasks also add to the total load to your system. The great thing about laying around on your sofa with your arms propped up is that it helps avoid swelling. The bad part about laying around too much is that it will eventually take less stress on your arms or trunk to cause swelling. Sort of like a catch-22, yes? So, better to get moving slowly to increase your strength and cardio endurance. Building strength and endurance over time means that your body may be able to withstand greater demands without swelling, and wouldn't that be terrific?! (In my dreams I am mighty!) By the way, this group is all about support vs competition, so anything you can do today is a good thing. Carol, I will PM you tomorrow, as I would like your guidance in forwarding info to others.",

As of this week, I am on the final-final-final leg of legal paperwork stuff for my mother. Whole project will definitely will be done by early next week as far as conference calls, decisions, and signing documents. I feel like I have made these same kinds of reports over and over, but this is THE big final hurdle and then I just need to put things in place as per decisions. I cannot wait to put this issue to bed! Yes, LoveToCook, I am enrolled in the Penn PAL study, but classes are finished and I am now doing the long-term reporting of my exercise. In spite of events over past two weeks, I have been consistent with the PAL program. I am feeling good about that and getting a grasp of organizing time to regularly include. My walking has suffered, as the friend I visited was recovering from surgery and we only did short stints on the beach and in park around corner from his house. I need to get back on track, but I am not beating myself up about that. My time spent with friend was more important. LTC, just adding the weight program to the walking I was doing almost doubles the time I have to commit to exercise. Incorporating all that with working is a challenge. My husband wears a pedometer to work, which has the effect of increasing his awareness of movement during day and motivating him to take stairs, use breaks to get in steps. A desk job can be difficult when it comes to getting in steps, and he really dislikes being sedentary. Becky, I hope whatever you are coping with re your mom is resolved soon. I know how tiring it can be, so it's good to listen to your body and take care of you. Being a caretaker isn't easy. Carol, those kinds of falls are frustrating, and hopefully your ankle and other sore areas are feeling better soon! Dawne, such terrific news! Glad your uncle could join you and make the event extra special.",

Yesterday while going through clothes I can no longer wear since my deconstruction, I opened a drawer and found several Brand New bathing suits that I never got to wear once my LE kicked in. If I can't wear a bra because they always sit on my \"hot spot\" and cause a flare, I doubt a bathing suit would be any kinder. Anyway, so I haven't faced trying on any of those yet, but I'm sure they are too low cut for forms. I can't even stand sitting in the sun, so I don't know why I am concerned. And then there's the fact that I am more out of shape now than in my entire life, and it's a struggle just to look at myself in shorts and a sleeveless top . . . Susie, I'm sorry you had such a rough day. You, too, Kira, and everyone here on this thread. I think this time of year always makes me a little sad and wistful. So many things to remind me of the past and what I now can no longer do. It's always the time that I think back to my carefree days.",

At the same time I was going through my bilateral mastectomy and recon with implants, I was also going through menopause. Combine that with a painful experience which really limited my ability to exercise and it's amazing how your body can change. The implants were supposed to be like some effing \"prize\" I got from having BC. Those bathing suits were purchased to celebrate my new \"boobs\", and I got to wear one Once before the LE kicked in. All the issues with my implants eventually led me to deconstruct, and mostly I've been so happy since I'm now pain free. I was sort of surprised to find myself upset about those stupid suits, but it's related to the loss I feel about the recon. This is my third summer with LE, and I honestly think there will always be some annual grieving that goes along with the season, as one can't help but acknowledge how life has changed. I have made great strides in coming to terms with my (once again) new appearance, but I will always miss the feeling of freedom to go anywhere I pleased with no worries. I think it's normal to experience this seasonal sadness. My best coping thoughts about my summer limitations and no longer being a \"summer girl\" are to think about how many different things there are to do in life. Because I can no longer do X, then I will just have to find new forms of fun and entertainment. Creativity has certainly helped me get through the the BC/recon saga, and I'm sure it will help me figure out new ways to enjoy life. I try to focus on the things I can do, vs. the things I can no longer do. It's the only way I keep my sanity and feel hopeful about my life and the future.",

I absolutely agree with you about taking our own personal histories into consideration when it comes to assessing our level of risk for a limb. I believe my negative experience with tissue expanders and implants placed an extra burden on my non-node side, and I treat it with almost as much care as my node side. I have not given in to IV or electronic BP on that side, but your story will make me reconsider manual BP and blood draws.

I don't feel well, and I am frustrated and angry over my inability to get anywhere. The idea that someone might come here with a made up scenario is too much for me. I ask that you forgive me for being flip after promising to zip it. With that being said, I do believe there are occasional trolls at BCO, and this is exactly the kind of post that is used to spark disagreements within a group. MrJoseph registered the day of his post and has not returned to acknowledge the comments posted by several members. I honestly found the style of his post more odd than his use of the word sphygmomanometer. As a former social worker who has worked in medical settings, in my opinion his post sounds like a medical note from a patient chart.

I hated those drains, and was so lucky to only have them a week. You are a real trooper to hang in there with them for so long, but I guess we just do what we have to do. You will make it and before long it will be only a memory. With the drains in, if it were me, I'd be careful about moving my arms around too much, of course that's easier said than done and coming from someone who didn't have to deal with them as long. I felt like stick woman, walking around and hardly moving my arms at all because it seemed like I always got that uncomfortable pulling feeling if I did much -- don't know if I could have been swinging my arms to music or putting shirts over my head. We are all so different, so it's what feels right for you and your PS's instructions. I've gone back and forth with taking the narcotics. Depends which stage I'm in. The first two days after surgery I took the dilaudid because I absolutely needed it to control the pain. When I developed an allergy and wasn't sure what caused it, I took myself off the dilaudid. Anyway, I was in pain and taking just tylenol until day 7 when I went to the PS and got my drains out. The PS's assistant looked at me like I had two heads when I said I was just taking tylenol. She wrote me a script for valium to relax my chest muscles and reduce pain and help me sleep. She also gave me a script the other day for percocet for the pain after the fills since I had such discomfort. My attitude toward the drugs (and I rarely take anything for headaches, etc.) is that I try and work around them, esp. when I know I need to drive somewhere. In the morning, if I know I have to go out and drive, I'll put off taking meds other than tylenol until I return home to the house. On days after fills I know now not to plan anything special -- I'll want to go home and take the meds and sit in the recliner. DH drives me to fill appts. so I can take the pain med in the car on the way home. I've never noticed mood changes when I stopped the drugs, but I have up an down days in general whether or not I'm taking the meds. At first it was more of a grieving, shock and loss thing, now I find I get more upset and frustrated when I can't do things and have to ask DH to get XYZ from closet cause it's too heavy. Or, I just get plain tired and worn out from things that normally wouldn't phase me. Getting up, showering, dressing and having to be ready for an early appt. can wipe me out. Stamina is low, simple things just seem more difficult, I have a harder time concentrating, too much going on all the time, no wonder I just sometimes break down and have a good cry. Then I feel a lot better. So my attitude is that the pain meds are there for a reason, and as long as I'm experiencing discomfort or pain and don't have to drive or be at peak performance, then I take them. Heck, I thought I was through with the pain meds until I started the fills and PT, but here I am again taking them a couple days at a time to get through. I hate them purely for the constipation factor. I know every day I take even one pill, the next day . . . nothing. So, I try and avoid anything longer than two days in a row. Stool softener helps, but it's not the be all end all.",

I have been thinking about sewing more lately, and making something functional like arm warmers would be great. Don't think you'll want any of my experiments!  Edited to add: Cookie, my first thought about the last fancy sleeve is that it works as an umbrella for our sleeve and glove/gauntlet. For those of us who hate to get caught in the rain because wet compression garments are not a good thing!",

I know we have discussed this before, can even recall Binney's defining how compression is measured and some comparison charts for the different classes in both US and European makers because they have slightly different numbers. Do the sleeve and glove have to be the same compression class? My custom sleeve and glove by Jobst are class I (made in Germany). I am just thinking sometimes it might be nice to have something sleeker than this combo for an evening out. If I get my measurements taken accurately, will a US class I be fine as far as compression (I am compression sensitive, so I think yes). Also, how does one know if the sleeve and glove are okay together? Can you combine brands? Can you combine US and European garments? For example, I am thinking about the restricted arm sleeve Lymphedivas is making, but it comes only in class II. They say they will make sure a larger sizing corrects for the extra compression, but what to do about a glove? I definitely need a glove. There are other sleeves I have looked at online and wondered the same thing, but Purple's question about the glove got me thinking since I noticed it is a class II. Can you size up for gloves that are in a higher compression class in the same way Lymphedivas is mentioning about the sleeve? Sorry, don't want to hijack, Cookie.",

Bermudagem -- I'm sorry your experience with the dye for the SNB was so painful. I remember reading that others here have applied some sort of numbing cream for a few days ahead of time, I think it is a prescription. My breast surgeon hadn't mentioned anything about this, and I decided I'd just go along with his way of doing things (he comes in early and does the dye thing himself), and I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't find it painful one bit. It is unfortunate that so early into your marriage that you have to deal with such tough life decisions, but your husband and his family sound warm and supportive. I hope this will bring you all closer. wahine -- I replastered the walls in one of our bedrooms in the months leading up to my surgery -- ran out of time and wasn't able to finish, but it can wait until I'm strong again. Sometimes it's good to have a focus that is distracting . . or at least lets your mind contemplate things without becoming overwhelmed. I believe I did some of my best thinking about my breast cancer and came to terms with my decision, how I would live life after bilat mast, etc. Busy hands allows the mind to connect with the heart in a good way. One of the best things I did to mentally prepare for my surgery and reconstruction, was to ask my PS to put me in touch with one of their patients who matched my build, type of surgery, etc. She and and I talked on the phone one evening and I found it reassuring to hear what the reconstruction process felt like, how she dealt with it, any pain, etc. I always do much better when I know what to expect. This woman was so nice and thoughtful -- she offered to meet me the next day and show me her new foobs. She had just had the expanders replaced with permanent implants and the incisions were about a week old. I cannot thank her enough for this experience. When I looked down and saw my incisions for the first time in the hospital, they looked just like what I thought they would. I also had a couple of other women who voluntarily showed me their scar (no reconstruction) and one with a 12-yr old reconstructed foob. The generosity these women show was such an inspiration. When I was showering at the hospital for the first time the morning I was leaving, a student nurse was being so very helpful. She was gathering towels, my clean clothes, and surgi-bra, etc. At one point it was clear I couldn't lift my arms to coordinate everything (darn drains!), and I had to ask her to come in and help me while I was standing there completely naked. At that moment, I gave up my need for control and do things myself. She was being so polite, trying to give me privacy, for which I was grateful. Suddenly, I looked at her and asked if she had ever seen a mastectomy -- her response was \"no\". I asked if she wanted to, and she said \"yes\". So, I turned and faced her fully and showed her my chest, explained about the expanders, the filling process, and eventual replacement with implants. And do you know what? It made me feel good, gave me back a feeling of ownership of my body. It is all new and different, but it is the me I'm going to live with and I want to become comfortable with it. This was my first small step in developing pride in my new body. There are a couple of conversations here that are helpful for preparing for hospital stay and getting your bedroom in order for your return. They're the ones titled, \"Is there a packing list for surgery?\" and \"Mastectomy..What to pack?? And what to do when return home?\" Personally, the thing I've found most helpful is the Lazy-boy recliner I borrowed from my sister-in-law. We put it in the living room and I find I tend to fall asleep there early evening, and then later go upstairs to bed. Comfort is a transient thing for me at this point still. For the bedroom, I purchased extra pillows and wedge foam piece. Pillows under the back seem to work best for me. Having pillows at your sides for your arms help those pesky drains from pinching. Sleeping on an incline does help with drainage and pressure. I would have loved to bring home that hospital bed, it made it so much easier to get in and out of bed. Sheila is so right about moving things to counter height -- in the kitchen, in the bedroom, closet, bathroom, etc. Zip and button front tops/jackets/pjs are key so you don't have to raise your arms above your head to dress.

It's been rainy here in PA both days, so I wonder if that has something to do with it. I had been complaining last of feeling kind of fatigued once I'd hit my post-2wk surgery mark, but breast and PS reassured me this was normal so I'd been allowing myself to relax as needed. Otherwise, the swelling had gone down and that had been feeling so much better. So, I'm disappointed to be back to pain mode again -- still taking the valium to relax my chest muscles but doesn't seem to be working as well. The expander on my right feels like it's digging into my rib, and my chest and pec muscles are feeling tight. Originally had a drug allergy in the hospital and upon returning home -- wasn't sure what it was so I stopped the dilaudid and had my antibiotic changed. Antibiotic is done since 4/18, and rash had begun to subside. With this new pain, I decided to take the dilaudid rather than trying to tough it out, and it looks like that I'm starting to feel itchy again! So, looks like I probably need to give that a rest just to make sure I don't become a scaley peeling mess again! Darn! Back to tylenol since I can't do ibuprofen or other nsaids. I have an appt. with the breast surgeon this Wed., so maybe he'll say it's ok to start doing some stretching exercises. My PS wants me to wait until 4 wks to do anything so as to avoid disturbing the pockets he's creating for the implants, so maybe I should call and talk with him tomorrow. My gut feeling is my pecs are starting to atrophy a bit and I might get some relief from this tightness with some simple stretches. Just curious, but those of you with recent bilat mast and expanders, have you been allowed to do some stretching or exercises? I've been told light walking only for 4 weeks and then they would make sure I got some PT at that point. Wahine, I got your PM and will respond soon. Glad to hear you got your surgery date set. Hey, that's the date of my first fill! Tina",

It's those little things that bring joy! As you say, each type of surgery has different requirements as far as type of bra/no bra to wear. As one who has expanders, I've discovered the body shaping tops without a shelf, which are supportive like a sports bra, but thinner and minus the bulky seams. I prefer the tank style for certain dresses and shirts. However, I don't know what these (almost girdle-like) garments are supposed to fit like, but I am usually a size 4, and I am wearing a size large tank and it still has lots of support (and this was with no fill at all). I can't imagine who's wearing the smaller sizes (or even why), unless it's to create a smooth silhouette under a slinky dress. Finally found a front zip bra that I like that's comfy, too, but that took a special trip to a mastectomy shop. It's a whole wardrobe adjustment period, esp. with the recent change from fairly cool to warm weather, but I don't want to go crazy and spend money on stuff that I won't be able to wear later. It's a tough stage, but being able to put things over-the-head increases choices big time. I've made the rounds at Target and K-Mart for a few pieces of cheaper short-term clothes, and Kohl's and Boscov's for undergarments. I started physical therapy last week, went twice. She said I was doing very well, so I'm off the paranoia wagon about being way behind range-of-motion-wise. I've been trying to walk a few times a week, and find this goes a long way for lifting my spirits. The rainy weather had put a slight damper on things for a few days, but now it's just beautiful outside. I've been hanging out over on the Breast Reconstruction thread since I've started my fills. Yesterday was my second one, and, same as the first, left me feeling quite uncomfortable. Less pain than the first time, but I prepared a little better -- hot shower, valium, and pain pill at the ready for the car ride if I sensed a start in pain. I did start to feel it, so I popped the pain med and was able to stay ahead of the pain curve. Today I feel slightly swollen, and I have a PT appt., so we'll see how that goes. I think we'll have to go easy this session. Sheila, it really is hard to not do things we're not allowed to do. Every once in a while I find myself picking up something a little heavy, and think, oh carp!, put that thing down. I hope your PS gives you good news about your flap and that it is healing nicely. Your path is so much tougher than mine, girl, and I have such admiration and respect for your determination. I feel like such a weenie complaining about my much smaller issues. Hugs, Tina",

      "Content": "Apr 11, 2008 05:40PM - edited Apr 11, 2008 05:41PM by Tina337 Hi, April gals. I just returned home today after bilateral mastectomy/expander surgery on Wed. I'm having some pain but trying to pop those pain killers on schedule to keep things under control. Also have a rash that could have been caused by a few things and taking benedryl to calm that. Results: no lymph involvement, so only sentinel node was removed. However, the big news is that I made the absolutely right decision when I went for the bilateral mast even though DCIS had only been found in right breast. Because of the other 5 biopsies (in both breasts), I was concerned that something had gone undetected. My surgeon got the pathology report back last night and stopped by to see me. Besides the diagnosed DCIS in the right breast, there were two additional areas in the R breast (another DCIS and a microinvasion). Two areas of DCIS were found in the left breast as well. Boy, do I feel like I just flew under the radar. My surgeon told me that he'll have me see the oncologist, but he's fairly sure that there will be no additional treatment. Wow, wow, I am so glad I went with my gut instinct about this, even though three surgeons had said a lumpectomy/radiation/tamox would be as effective as a mast. I'm also grateful to my primary physician who urged me to have the bilateral mast. I guess because she wan't the surgeon, she didn't feel she had to be so tight-lipped about my decision. In response to aurabelle and 1965Sally's post above: \"I am getting more and more depressed as I wait for mine on April 30th. I had thought I would be eager to get it over with - that's what I was feeling before it got scheduled. Now I think I'm starting to grieve and worry.\" I know exactly how you feel. When you're in the phase of gathering info, there's an ability to focus a little more abstractly about your condition. Once all the facts are in, decision is made (if choice is possible), and surgery scheduled, it becomes a reality. My doctor gave me a prescription for xanax and urged me to use it in the days leading up to the surgery. I used it daily and when I wasn't tearful, I tried to think positively. You will make it, both of you!!",

They have more structure to hold the pad than the shelf style camis. The brand I bought was Amoena, but there are a couple other brands out there. You could wear the one side with the pad and go without on your braless side. I go without the pads and wear the cami to sleep in or when I'm feeling ultra sensitive and don't want too much pressure. My insurance covered this purchase and the store took care of the paperwork. I would definitely ask the PS about a script for PT. One thing I did at home after I got my script but before I could get on the PT schedule was to put on some music in my living room and dance by myself. Didn't do anything super fast or any jerky movements, but something with a medium beat that made me want to move. I found that I could move my arms in a variety of motions/angles and let my body be my guide. I didn't force anything, just enjoyed the flow/movement that let me stretch slightly. It's also a great substitute for walking on rainy days. I think the key is to go easy and don't do anything that hurts, but I certainly feel a positive light stretch. It never makes me sore afterward, and I think it makes my back feel better as well. I still do it just because I like it. Gotta admit PT pushes me more than I was doing on my own, but it's good because you know you're doing things in the right position, how far to stretch, etc. The second time I went the therapist actually stretched me out as I was lying on a table. I could really feel how tight I am in certain places, esp. in the arm pits. There was some discomfort, but nothing intolerable, and she always made sure she wasn't pushing too much. I think the bottom line is that there is going to be some discomfort in order to get back to your starting point. Not pain, but a little effort over time. The therapist has slowly increased the number of exercises I do there and I am supposed to do them on off days at home as well. I went through PT a while back when I broke my foot, so I know that you have to force yourself to do the exercises if you want the full range of motion back. (The way they tortured me back then doesn't even compare to what I'm doing now, but that was a whole different kind of injury.) Talk about putting stuff over your head -- it's a lot easier to get it over than to get it off. A few weeks ago I had to ask some poor clerk at the Target fitting room to come into my room and help me get a shirt off. It was rather embarrassing, because I had taken off my cami and was totally exposed. She was quite nice and kind about the whole thing though. Taught me a lesson though about not forcing things. I still can't put tight fitting tops/dresses off and on over my head, but I'm almost there. Sheila's method for putting the opening over head first and then one arm at a time works for the bilateral as well, but agree the top has to be looser at first. Kathy, I had no saline placed in my expanders at the time of surgery. My PS said since I am slender, he wants to go slow. First fill was at 4 weeks post surgery and was 60ccs, which is what each fill will be. I go 2-3 weeks between fills and after my final fill will \"rest\" for 4 weeks before exchange surgery. Just got all this info yesterday so I could plan my summer. I have 2 or 3 more fills. Looks like exchange surgery will be Sept. I sure hope you get those final drains removed next week! My goodness, it is the one thing that makes you feel human again!",

I went for MLD with my LE therapist about three times in the two months prior to my surgery. I also became very diligent with doing self MLD and drinking lots of water, and all the positive things that keep my LE stable. For me, low salt in my diet and limited alcohol help keep my LE in check. I also planned to have MLD for a few weeks post surgery to help promote lymphatic flow while things were healing. I did have to wear compression more often for a while.  Because my truncal LE somewhat effects my non-node side, I wanted a neck IV and BP taken in my calf during surgery. I happened to read here about Dr. Marga Massey, a PS who does flap and tissue transfer reconstruction surgeries. She also has trained in LE care and has her LANA certification. She does MLD on her patients prior to surgery and she then wraps their at risk arms to help limit fluid traveling to the arms during surgery. She seemed to be the perfect fit for me as far as LE care even though I was deconstructing and not having any further reconstruction surgery. So, I travelled to Charleston, SC and had my surgery done by her. I do believe my proactive care at home prior to surgery, Dr. Massey's pre-operative care, and the care I received at the hospital immediately after surgery (MLD that night in my hospital room), the MLD I received daily for two weeks following surgery, and then twice a week for a few more weeks all helped minimize the impact of surgery on my truncal LE. I also was diligent with self care in the few weeks after surgery, keeping well hydrated, and all the positives I mentioned doing prior to surgery. I was on an antibiotic for two weeks post surgery. I would suggest taking proactive care prior to and after surgery with MLD and good self care would be of primary importance. Best to make sure ahead of time the surgeon and hospital are aware of your LE and that no IV or BP would be used on that side. I like to think since they are going in for node work on that side that this would be obvious, but I would make sure to discuss and have on record. I'd also mention to staff the day of surgery.",

My face is a big red blotch, my neck, and chest, too. This evening it seems to be finally calming down after getting the new antibiotic from PS last night. Never had any drug allergies before, so this is all new to me. I feel more sore, swollen and uncomfortable today than I did the last two days. I think I must have been running on adrenaline and finally ran out! Visiting nurse came yesterday and said everything looked good -- she reassured me the drainage areas were not infected, rather the area was red from the rash. Tomorrow the OT comes to do some lymph edema education and evaluate ability to do daily tasks. Looks like the drains are coming out Wed., and I absolutely cannot wait!!

It certainly has become a large group for April. gg44, congrats on your results. Glad to hear you are feeling well. Good luck on your exchange today, Dani. I'm glad you mentioned your biography from Jan -- it was reassuring to read. I am at the point where I'm just starting to feel an improvement in ability to reach for and lift objects, but my body is quite adept at telling me when I'm overdoing it. I, too, like to keep the house in good order, but I'm giving myself a break and letting things go a little. inezpa, good luck on your exchange tomorrow. The drains came out yesterday!! That was a completely pain-free experience, as the front and sides of my chest are still totally numb. The sides of my chest feel swollen and this is a little freaky. Without the pinching of the drains it's not so bad. The weirdest thing is that my stomach, mostly in the evenings, has a mushy water-filled spare tire around the waist. Also, I noticed that the right side pops out in front a little. PS reassured me that it was just water that was finding it's way to areas of least resistance and that wasn't a cause for alarm. She said as I become more mobile it should work its way out, but it is quite unsettling for someone who is used to having a fairly slim tummy and waist. There's a small amount of bruising in the upper abdomen just below my chest. The PS also took the tape off the incisions during the visit, so I had the first real look at everything. I'm very pleased with the initial results. I'm still so grateful that I made the right choice with going with the bilateral mast, it's hard for me to imagine being disappointed in how anything looks. Even a flat chest would be fine -- I can look ahead without fear.",

Any and all questions should be welcomed and answered honestly and patiently. My diagnostic process lasted from mid-November through late January 2008. I had DCIS diagnosed immediately in one area, and then had five more biopsies that were spread out until the very end. I was feeling so-so about my breast surgeon, but stuck things out. I always felt like I had to bang on the table to get her attention, get a follow-up appt. in a reasonable time, get her staff to return my calls, etc. When I met with her, I felt like I had her attention, but I just always had this nagging thought about her. Her office was chaotic, so I wondered if she'd be fully attentive during my surgery. It was just my gut instinct. I also didn't care for my primary physician, and at that point I decided to bail out on her, too. So, I found a new primary physician and got a referral for a new surgeon. I took two steps back when I could have been having my surgery within a very short time, but ultimately, I'm so glad I switched. My new breast surgeon is terrific and he hooked me up with a different plastic surgeon, oncologist, radiation oncologist, and I was able to ask all kinds of questions and make an informed decision about the type of surgery and treatment that was best for me. I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders and I knew I was going to be in good hands. After being held at bay by my first surgeon for months, my current breast surgeon's office was able to book an operating room for him and my PS to do my bilat mast and expanders within a week and a half's time. Good docs care for their patients and can make things happen for them in the time it needs to. Having come through surgery, I still feel so pleased with my choices. Both doctors were attentive to me while I was in the hospital post surgery and have been available via phone since I've been home. I know I will be comfortable meeting with them for upcoming follow-up appts. over the next months. I hope you are able to take the time to meet with one or two plastic surgeons. A consultation shouldn't take more than a 1/2 hour. Your breast surgeon and you and your husband can explain your concern about how soon your surgery can be arranged. I hope you are able to work things out. You deserve to have the best care possible and a plastic surgeon that wants to make you happy with your new body. Tina",

Some people struggle more with anxiety than others, but I want you to know you can get through this process. I had six biopsies, two were stereotactic (using digital mammo), two were via ultrasound, and two were via MRI (which is similar to stereotactic, except that it's \"live\" vs. a single snapshot, i.e., you are held in the clamped position for the whole time). I also had to have dye injections in preparation for my bilateral mastectomy, the usual IVs, etc. I am petrified of needles, and I don't consider myself a brave person in general. What I did during these procedures and and the moments leading up to surgery was to practice mindful meditation, choosing something to focus on, most often my breathing. If I kept my eyes open, I would find a neutral point in the room on which to focus while the procedure was occurring. I was able to maintain a single position without moving during regular MRIs, which required about 1/2 hr. of laying completely still, and then during the biopsies via MRI which lasted a bit longer. I suggest you first practice focusing on your breathing during a non-stressful time so that you can become familiar with the concept. I used a couple of books by Jon Kabat-Zinn to learn the practice of mindful meditation, and they helped me throughout my several month diagnostic process, and now it is useful in my healing and expansion process. It is also very helpful in dealing with pain. I did take ativan to calm myself down before each procedure, but the focused breathing is what got me through every process. I asked questions ahead of time to know what to expect, and then told them how I would be working to manage my fear and anxiety during the process. I told them unless anything was wrong, I'd only be answering with simple verbal responses or hand movements. Please don't let your fear prevent you from getting the best possible treatment. We all are scared during this time, but have to find that inner strength to get through. You will find this strength, and we will all be here to support you. Hugs, Tina",

Only in undoing my reconstruction did I realize how much this \"simple\" surgery had altered my body. I don't blame you for being conflicted, as the lat flap recon is even more involved. Are you athletic and very active in certain sports? I would ask the women here whether or how much implant recon and lat flap recon have limited their abilities. What I can say about my own experience with implant recon, is I wish I had never done it. It caused me a lot of pain, and now that I am flat, I feel so much better. I go without prosthetics and I feel good about my self image. In fact, I think I look better flat than I did with the implants. I know there are so many here on these forums who are very happy with their recons though. I am not trying to be negative or anti-implant or recon, it's just that after being on BC.org for four years, I know that implants aren't as easy as they sound. Reoperations, revisions, and fat grafting are common. I don't usually post all this info, but since you said you are worried, I thought you might appreciate. It's a lot different than hearing women two months out from exchange surgery saying how much they love their implants. If you want unbiased info, then read the FDA's info on silicone implants in the documents below. Pages 25-32 in the first document has Mentor's three-year follow up study on recon patients with silicone implants. Tables 1-6 are interesting. www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalD...  And here is Allergan's seven-year followup on recon patients with silicone implants on pages 23-31 of their document. Tables 1-4 and Figures 1-2 are informative. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/BreastImplants/UCM245626.pdf",

Anyway, I appreciate your understanding, and I deleted my comment, too.  The idea of cadaver skin never sat right with me either and I never would have allowed. My myofascial PT said that alloderm is not absorbed by the body and does not go away. I learned more about implant recon in the process of trying to undo mine than I did when it was offered to me prior to my bilateral mast. I think the process is misrepresented as an easy surgery compared to the fat/flap microsurgeries out there.  ",

I've had both, and while the positioning is awkward, in my opinion a general MRI could be done without Ativan or Xanax. Some general breast MRIs have you positioned with your arms at your sides, while others will have your arms raised above your head. The latter is the one I experienced. Because you are faced downward in either case, for me there wasn't any any of that claustrophobic concern. The most uncomfortable part of the experience is the \"thingy\", I have no idea what it's called, that rests between your breasts and left me with a bit of bruising. They will attempt to create more padding with a towel over this piece if you tell them it's bothering you. The only other unusual feeling I had during the process was when the dye was injected, which created a \"cool\" feeling in my arms, but it could also be that by that point my arms were just getting that uncomfortable \"pins and needles\" feelings when you lay in one spot too long. The IV had been put in my arm prior to laying down, so after they take several rounds of photos, they then inject the dye into the IV and then take more rounds with the dye. All in all, not that bad of an experience, and I was told each step of the process before it happened. I would say the regular MRI took about 45 min. The technicians at my center were very sensitive to privacy, had me draped with a gown and my breasts weren't exposed until I leaned downward to get into position. I know there were male staff in the center, but they were doing the computer stuff in the other room, and only women worked with me in the room. May have been a coincidence, but it was the same all three times. The noise during the procedure didn't bother me a bit, and I didn't ask for music, etc. Anyway, the two biopsies I had via MRI were more stressful and uncomfortable for me. They definitely have your arms positioned over your head for this procedure. I would recommend having a Ativan or similar relaxant for this. I don't think I was imagining this, but the procedure seemed to take longer than the regular MRI -- they had to do the dye, see if the same spots enhanced, which required the several rounds of photos, and then proceed with the biopsy. Even when taking the Ativan, I focused on my breathing, which really helped me stay calm, stay in position, and helped me feel the procedure passed more quickly. Sometimes I closed my eyes, other times I found a spot within the tube I would focus on while I was doing my breathing. Tina",

I was flying home the next day, so I waited to have my foot examined and x-rayed locally. When I was on the phone with my primary's nurse to get an x-ray script faxed, she mentioned something about crutches. At that point, I realized this broken foot was going to have an impact on my well-being, and I needed to think about how it might affect my LE. When I met with the orthopedic dr., I reviewed my BC history and current condition. I told him I thought using crutches held the potential to aggravate my truncal LE since they would create pressure on a compromised lymphatic area. After discussing the break, which fortunately wasn't too bad, he fitted me with a walking boot/cast vs. a plaster cast. I had to wear it 24/7 for 4 weeks but was allowed to take off for bathing if I used a shower chair. I pressured him to let me drive when necessary - it was my right foot - which he didn't normally allow. I agreed I wouldn't divert from wearing the boot otherwise and only took the boot off once I was in the car and put it back on before I exited. I can say that except for showering and driving, I wore the boot religiously. I definitely wanted my foot to heal well and not have any lingering pain.  My other concern about having a casted foot was the lack of mobility and whether that might trigger some swelling. I used a large ball to work my abs, back and legs. I didn't stand for any exercises. I also used my bands and did my daily stretches. I really watched my diet and salt intake and drank lots of water. The boot made sleeping difficult, and I had to resort to sleep medication occasionally. The weather prior to my break had been sporadically hot and humid - unusually so for June - but I had continued to be active both inside and out without any issues. However, after the break, I did notice an increase in swelling. While we did have a major heat wave and humidity at that time, I really think my poor sleep and being sedentary was the main cause of the swelling.  Anyway, cast was removed 8am this morning. I'm feeling pretty good, just a little sore and pooped since I was on my feet and walked around until 5pm. No PT required - limited to walking on flat surfaces and bicycling for two weeks. Coincidentally, my cousin broke her foot around the same time, but it was quite serious and she was homebound for 8 wks. Besides crutches, her dr. also prescribed a knee-walker, which allowed her to cook, apply makeup, etc. while standing and gave her armpits a rest. It was a pretty nifty gadget and would be another alternative to crutches for those with LE. \"Life isn't about finding yourself, life is about creating yourself.\" ~ George Bernard Shaw Dx 11/13/2007, DCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

They need support finding garments, prosthetics and have their own issues of coping with being flat. A while back I posted something and one of these gals gently reminded me of that, and she said it was sometimes hard to feel welcome here because many of us seem so anti-reconstruction. This really gave me pause and made me think about how all the forums here on BCO often overlap. Breast cancer is what brings us all together, and we all deserve support in our decisions even when they differ from others. BC diagnoses and treatments overwhelm and make it difficult to know what to choose. Some will be happy with reconstruction; some will regret it; some will be forced to undo their recon when it fails; others choose no recon and don't look back; and yet there are others who live flat by choice for many years and then decide to reconstruct. BC is a wicked ride, and as much as I rant against certain things, I always wish for my sisters to be happy with their bodies once surgeries and treatments are complete.",

I got home on Fri. from my bilateral mast/expanders surgery, and I'm feeling pretty good. I'll feel a lot more human once these drains come out, and that will hopefully be this week. I chose the bilateral mast even though there was only one confirmed area of DCIS in my right breast. I was paranoid after 6 biopsies (areas in both breasts) that something had gone undetected. With a needle biopsy, only samples of the areas were taken -- my concern was about those other cells that weren't tested but were part of what lit up on the MRI. So, I went the conservative route, even though the surgeons considered the lumpectomy to be adequate treatment, as long as I did radiation and tamox. Thurs. night my surgeon gave me the pathology results. He said I had made a wise decision. Turns out that in addition to the known area of DCIS in my right breast, there was a second area of DCIS and a small area of microinvasion. Then, to top it off, they found two areas of DCIS in my left breast as well. I am so glad I trusted my gut instinct. I did not want to be revisiting the biopsies, surgery thing again, and it appears I certainly would have. Now I have the turtle shells, and that's something that's going to take a little getting used to! I think what freaks me out the most at this point are the drains and the numbness. I've been told to expect some more swelling and bruising, but that it would then subside. I hope the numbness thing goes away at some point.",

After having a mastectomy, a recon gone awry (and chronic pain at the time), truncal and arm LE, I feel like I have been fast forwarded to a different decade. Undoing the recon and relief from pain gave me a few years back, but I still feel quite confused about where I am. My body looks a hell of a lot older, I can tell you that. LE is a daily reminder of the things I can no longer do, and I hate it, find it frustrating, and have had to deal with those losses. I try to approach LE as a reminder that there are many things I can do in life. I happened to like certain activities, but maybe this is a wake up to break out of doing old favorite things and try some new ones. Either that or I continue to wish for what was . . . and it's not to say I don't ever go there. Sometime it hits me like a truck out of nowhere and brings me to my knees. ALL of these changes are major life altering experiences, and no one can truly understand unless they've been there or gone through some sort of permanent body disfiguration or malfunction. It takes a while to find your way back from where you've gone. Frankly, I'm still pretty effing lost at times. But I sure am trying, and each day I'm on the lookout for friendly signposts.",

However, would using the rebounder as a substitute for jogging outside (with my feet lightly lifting the ground) be a problem? I figure it's all about the level of exertion your body is able to tolerate without developing swelling -- whether on ground or rebounder?",

I'm the gal Anne is referring to that used Dr. Massey for my implant removal surgery. The ladies here are a wealth of information and so supportive and kind. I think they also moonlight as comediennes, but I digress. Their info helped me find my way in the beginning when my docs denied I had truncal LE, and they will guide you, too! I am home and feeling in a much better place emotionally. Final drain was removed Monday morning by Dr. Massey before I flew home. She came and did it while I was having my MLD session. I've also been off the pain meds, anti-nausea meds and antibiotic for several days. I feel much better without the drugs. My stomach is still flip flopping from the antibiotic - I think that's what caused it. I tried to stay on top of the probiotics on opposite times of the antibiotic so my system didn't get screwed up, but I felt very woozy for days and it really did a number on my appetite and willingness to take anything. I don't have a fever and don't think I have an infection, but I am going to monitor. I got so backed up after this surgery. I really think it's kind of related, as I'm just starting to feel regular again. Ugh, TMI. Anyway, being home and feeling better physically and minus the drain has given me some emotional strength. I feel like I'm through the darkest part, but I know I have more mourning to do. Dr. Massey talked a bit with me at our last appt, and she said this was all normal and to be expected. She said to give myself some time. It definitely took me back to the wounded period of the mastectomy and feelings of loss. I know I will get through this eventually - I do have confidence in myself and know I can process and come to terms with WHAT IS. Then I'll be pleasantly happy with any changes or improvements.  Kira, I really do think you're right about the PTSD. My diagnostic period lasted four months with six biopsies, and they were all over the place about how bad my situation was. Then I had the mastectomy and five months of expansion hell - which I think is really what did me in emotionally. The doctor's office was unsympathetic, so I felt quite isolated during that period. The prolonged pain of living with the implants over the past 2 1/2 years just added insult to injury. So, I am definitely going to be kind to myself and give my body, heart and mind time to heal. I feel so much better without the implants, and that makes me hopeful. I get a little worried about having to do a revision since I want this to be over, but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. I'm feeling 75% better even with the post-surgery soreness, and that's a real positive! Lymphedema is still under control and wasn't affected by the flying. I wore a sleeve and glove on both arms since I have occasional truncal swelling on my non-node side and some post surgery swelling on both. Of course, I also wore my tank with inserts on both sides of my trunk below the underarm area. Thanks again for all your support and brownies! ",

We all know it stinks, but we're doing our best to cope and live healthy and productive lives. Every time someone goes through a flare, expresses concern about infection, or worries about something unusual, it reminds me that when I'm going through a rough time that I have a place where I can \"talk\" and no one will judge me for being negative or whatever. I loved \"Bright-Sided\" by Barbara Ehrenreich - I was grateful to find someone who expressed so many of my thoughts on the BC experience. And I remember reading the Q&A response from Rosalind Kleban that Kira posted above. That really hit home for me, too. My favorite line from her response is: \"A bad attitude will cause only one thing and that is a bad day. The best reason for having a good attitude is that on that day you will enjoy yourself. But neither the good nor the bad attitude will affect the illness. It will affect the quality of the day that you are having.\" I just love that. While I don't want to get sucked into a routine of melancholy, sometimes circumstances are overwhelming and it's helpful to yield to the feelings of sadness, anger or pain you are experiencing that day. It isn't the end of the world. I often find that I truly feel better emotionally and physically (and more positive) once I allow myself to acknowledge and feel whatever it is I'm feeling. It sure beats faking being positive.  When I'm asked if my LE is better yet, I usually take a deep breath, and respond: \"LE is just like heart disease or diabetes. It is a chronic condition that needs to be managed. I can tell you how I'm doing right now, but if you ask me another day, my symptoms could be quite different.\" I don't get nearly as upset as I used to when I have to explain that (again). What makes me crazy is that once my friends and family DO get it about the permanency of LE, they still don't grasp all the things I worry about - bites, cuts, sun, humidity, etc. I'm still working on that. I think people can only retain so much about other's medical conditions.  Kane, I'm right there with you, hibernating inside today with the a/c. I'm near a window, and it looks like a beautiful summer day. Used to be my favorite season, and now it's my least.  Laura! I am SO SO sorry to see you on this forum. I hope you get past the wrapping stage and into the compression garment asap. Man, you have been such a support for so many women, as well as a model of the possibilities of a successful recon with radiation. My heart goes out to you.   ",

She wasn't LANA certified, and while she acknowledged I had slight signs of LE, she never addressed with MLD. Instead, she had me doing a variety of exercises, some of which I probably shouldn't have been doing. I missed that prime window of time for taking care of early LE, and in April I had the major flare. I won't even go into the additional time I spent arguing with my BS and PS that I actually had LE and needed special treatment - NOT from my former PT. So I have this great anger toward my original PT: \"How could you have done this to me!\" Alternately, there's the \"How could you be such an effing idiot!\" and \"You call yourself LE trained?\" In these scenarios when I blame my original PT, the \"what if\" centers on \"What if the PT had properly addressed my original symptoms when they were slight and barely noticeable?\" Would I feel better than I do now? Whew! I can't believe I left that one out! That's directly related to the deep sadness I feel about LE being FOR LIFE. I know it doesn't help to blame another person any more than it does myself at this point, but those thoughts exist occasionally.  Suzy, I'll add another Yeehah!!! to your King Tut unwrapping tonight! Here's a little \"Do as I say, not as I do\" misbehaving from last night. Didn't drink as much water during the day as I usually do . . don't know why, I forgot. Anyway, I leave the house at 4:30 and I'm hit with a wall of heat. Sun blaring down on me, crap! I get in the car, turn on the air, ouch the seats are hot! I have two bottles of water with me. Thanks to Binney's comments, I've been wrapping my foot after it started to swell once my walking cast/boot came off. Sure enough, it has reduced the swelling and remaining pain significantly. I will admit I have been doing this partly in the hope that I'd be able to stand, move around or dance a little at last night's concert. Between 6:30 and 12:30 I ate dinner, had three cocktails, and danced for a good three hrs (threw caution to the wind about vinegar, spices, hydration, overheating, etc.) I had a blast! It was particularly warm at certain points, but I found where the good sources of a/c were and gravitated there as needed. Felt a little swollen in my trunk by the end of the evening, as well as my foot. Wrapped my foot but no MLD before bed. Today, truncal swelling back to norm, but foot still complaining a little. I cannot tell you how much I needed to dance like a wild woman and to just let go! By the way, I knew my top showed hints of my distorted boobies, but was the most comfy thing to wear for the occasion. I stood up straight when I walked into the venue and silently uttered MOTC's rally of Fuck Them! to anyone who might notice or care. ",

I am glad you are asking this question though, because it is exactly what I am wondering myself. I had a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction two years ago and have developed capsular contracture in my right implant. I also have truncal lymphedema in my right side. Both of these problems cause a lot of pain. I am learning to live with and manage the LE, but the CC has got to go.   I have been researching replacing my implants, trying to find statistics on the success of implants and for revisions for capsular contracture. Some of the info I've found makes me think I should just remove them. I am most concerned about my health, and lymphedema care is a priority. The idea of redoing the implants and having them fail and then going through surgery again might be too much for me emotionally. I have been so stuck in limbo and really need to get back to living. My goal is to have surgery in February, whatever I decide. What has me most concerned about the appearance of my chest - whether it is sunken or not - is because I haven't been able to wear a bra due to the lymphedema. The side band sits on my \"hot spots\" under my armpit and around back and causes the area to swell. So, I may have to go formless, and I hope it's not an ugly sight. However, the implants have always seemed too big and part of the problem with getting things to fit, so maybe I'd have better luck without them. I didn't pad during my expansion and never minded my appearance, so if I could, I would actually prefer to go formless unless an outfit/occasion made it necessary.  Susan and Mary Beth, thank you for your posts. They are both encouraging. ",

She has worked with women who have implant problems and want to switch and have breasts constructed from their own tissue and fat. She does amazing work.

Your comments made me think about my friend who is a nurse practitioner for a couple of nursing homes. She sees patients to offset the number of times the doctor has to see them. Anyway, I had quizzed her about how many of her patients had LE and she said none of them. (Yes, she needs to take your course!) I had also asked if any of her patients had compression garments or were wrapped. She said no. She said if they had LE then it was under control. Well, now I am wondering whether Medicare has just not been paying for garments or wrapping, which is why none of them have garments or get wrapped. Goodness knows, she couldn't see that my hand and arm had any swelling, so I wouldn't count on her to recognize LE in any of her patients.",

I had a similar one and have come a long way since April when I deconstructed, having my implants removed and the muscle repaired. I had a rough expansion phase but was reassured the pain would be gone once the permanent implants were in place. I was fine for three months, then I developed mild truncal lymphedema. Didn't receive good care by the first LE therapist, and within six months I had a major flare. I found a new therapist and was treated properly. At the same time, my implant started to distort and poke outward and became quite painful. My PS wasn't very helpful and minimized the issue. Eventually, after getting a second op, my original PS diagnosed capsular contracture. I didn't like the sound of any of his solutions, and by that point I had found a PT, a LE therapist, and LE physiatrist I trusted, as well as having a good friend who is a PT. My lymphedema became the overriding factor in my choice to deconstruct. I initially met with a different PS to consider replacing my implants, and I read a lot about the risks for developing CC again with replacement implants. Any surgery was a risk for exacerbating my truncal LE and causing more scar tissue, which really frightened me. I didn't think I could handle that plus another possible implant failure, which would then require another surgery. So, I opted to quit and get off the pain roller coaster in order to save my sanity. It was a tough decision, and it was definitely like revisiting the bilateral mast three years earlier. At least it brought relief, and I no longer felt imprisoned by silicone objects inside me. My chest is not a pretty sight, and one of my pectoral muscles was permanently damaged and couldn't be completely repaired. My ribs are concave from the expanders/implants, and my PS left some extra skin to minimize the impact of surgery on my LE. It is what it is, and while I had hoped for a tidier chest, I have come to terms with the new me. Because of the truncal LE, I have chosen for now to go form free and have been experimenting with new clothes. I am finally feeling good in my own skin again and confident with how I look. I am glad to be healthy and 99% pain free. Unfortunately, the LE is forever but it is much easier to cope with now. The PS who removed my implants instructed me to give myself time to mourn and get used to my chest. It sure is a tough process, but it can be done. I wish you the best, Jtsig, and hope you feel better as time passes.",

She confirmed the forms were received and Mr. Weiss can call or correspond directly with them on my behalf. She asked questions regarding attendance at the committee meeting, but I said I needed to call her back with that info. She gave me her direct number. I forwarded all info to Mr. Weiss and will see how he wants to handle.  lisa-e, I know the inconsistencies are complete BS, but they claim it all varies according to the policy. They try and make the employer look like the bad guy and that they didn't elect to have this coverage included in their policy. They are so full of it. This really has nothing to do with my husband's employer, rather it relates to the rights provided for women under the Cancer Act, etc.  PinkHeart, I do not believe my doctor's assistant was motivated to do much, even though my doctor had been very caring and compassionate. This was my experience with the assistant before my doctor transferred to a different department, so it was no surprise when she never called me and told me when she faxed things so I could follow up. SHE wouldn't always return my calls or email. Oh, and the kicker (sorry if I am repeating myself) was when Blue Cross called her and said they never received the five articles my doctor sent with her appeal letter. The assistant said she no longer had the articles, but that I did and they should contact me. Well, Kira and Binney had helped me pull those together and I had sent the articles to the assistant as electronic documents that were attached in an email. She had agreed to print them and fax them with my doctor's letter. I believe she printed and faxed them, but unless she had deleted my email (which I would consider part of my medical record), she still had those freakin' electronic documents, and all she had to do was attach in an email and send to Blue Cross. Instead, it looked like those articles came from me, and I was left explaining that the doctor had originally sent these with her letter of appeal. I probably would have been better off handling the appeal myself. Blue Cross' unwillingness to honestly answer questions posed to them on the phone makes me nuts. They deliberately lie or speak in gibberish. For example, Mr. Weiss had asked me to get copies of IBX's (Blue Cross in Phila area) policy bulletins regarding compression garments, looking for info on coverage as a result of lymphedema resulting from a mastectomy. So, I look at IBX's website and cannot seem to find any documents other than basic info about my coverage and how to appeal. My handbook has more info but not what I want. So I am googling and come up with results for medical policies on compression garments for practically every state in the union except PA's or IBX's. I call IBX, tell them what I want, and I am referred to my handbook regarding my coverage or that I can go to their website and look at all the other individual policies to see what their coverage provides for compression garments. I state that I want their general policy on compression garments, and she says she doesn't have that. Oh, and once again I am referred to my husband's employer as to compression garment coverage. Ugh. So I get really pissed off and sit and root around their freakin website for almost and hour, and finally!!! Bingo! Way down I find a page on policy, and when I click on it, a page comes up that urges patients to ask their doctors to review these documents because they have big fancy medical terms that they might not understand. F@$k you. Click. And there they are in their entirety. I print them before they can somehow magically disappear and then scan and send them. I had a giant three-ring binder on my BC testing, six biopsies that took three months before I actually got a final diagnosis and then had surgery. My pathology reports, recovery instructions, etc. went in there. I had a separate binder for my implant reconstruction and stuff from my plastic surgeon. I have a lymphedema file, and I also have a file for my deconstruction (Blue Cross was a nightmare about that), and I guess I need to start a new one for the appeal(s). Files, files, files . . . but they are absolutely necessary because at some point you just can't remember everything.",

Thank you for putting that experience right in my head. Your thoughtful words often touch each of us so deeply, and you are such a kind soul. I'm so glad you are a member of this forum. Friday I found myself bopping up and down the stairs in our house, noticing the lightness without the weight of the implants and pain. I was dressed and had the thought that if I focus on what I am doing rather than how I look, that I can do this, no matter what my final appearance is. Many people have been dealt a crappy hand, and they go on and live happy and productive lives. There's no reason why I can't. I have a husband who loves me and a happy home. Except for some financial woes, which hopefully will be ironed out when I can return to work, my life is everything I have ever wanted. So, I'm looking at the positive and learning to move on while my body, heart and soul heal from this long journey. Last night, out with friends celebrating my husband's birthday, I found myself laughing harder than I have in quite a while. I think that's a very good sign! In some ways, life is good if you say it is . . SleeveNinja - About the compression tank, I have broad shoulders, and even though I am thin, I have found it hard to find garments that don't cut in my back or underarms. For me, Maidenform's \"Control It\" tank is best. With my implants, I wore a large, but I may fit in a medium now. I use the round Swell Spots under my arms that Binney mentioned. They don't always get around back if I have a flare or extra swelling though. I have pieces of orange foam my therapist cut that cover each side of my trunk and extend around back that I use for sleep at those times. I have an X-large tank for that get up. I remember my therapist showing me crescent shaped inserts that I think would have worked well, esp. around in the back, but they didn't extend down the side if my trunk enough. I have noticed that without the implants my compression tanks are much more comfortable and don't cut under my arms or back as much. Naturally, I am thrilled about that.",

Sounds like they are relatively easy to don, but I'm wondering if you need to be able to raise your arms above shoulder height to do it. That will probably be a no-no for me for a couple weeks post surgery when I have my implants removed. I want a matching glove, too, and I'm sure I'll want the tee shirt for truncal LE once I'm flat. I've never been able to find a tank that fits me well. Maybe having no implants will increase my options. Kira, this US/European compression class thing is interesting.

When I recently ordered a new sleeve and glove and had to give the glove sizing info to my dr, I found the packaging difficult to interpret, as it's primarily in German with a few words in English. I believe it's a CCL 1, but three sets of numbers appear in a small space. They are: III / CCL 1 / 724, and then there's another product number below that reads 2011-12. I really dislike the bulkiness of this glove, and the fabric pills so easily. I've only worn a handful of times, so I can only imagine how quickly it would need replacing if worn daily. It doesn't look very nice next to the sleeve either.",

I have wondered why that is so, as I would think it would further help stretch the skin in that node area.

We haven't done any beach stuff - I'll save that for the next trip. Have been wanting to see, but it's actually starting to get HOT here. We have really lucked out with the weather. Our first week here it was in the low 80s, but now it's in the mid-70s. The locals say this kind of weather is rare - it's usually cold and then becomes really hot, so they treasure days in the 70s. If it were more hot and humid, I would be freaking out. After 2pm it starts to get a little too much for me if I can't find some shade. Actually, I'm hoping that some of this swelling I'm having is similar to the humid summer weather at home . .  ah, probably wishful thinking! Tomorrow we are having dinner at Fig. It has received great reviews and the menu looks interesting.  http://www.eatatfig.com/ We had lunch at the Black Bean Co. yesterday, and it was delicious. I asked my LE therapist if she knew of a healthy place, and she recommended this, which was only a few blocks from the hospital. www.blackbeanco.com/store/1/menu  We walked some today, but I am trying to slow down a bit as my drain output was higher after more walking. It was at the level it needed to be for almost two days until I started walking a lot. So, this weekend I am taking it a little easier so it can be pulled Monday morning before I fly home. ",

Well, the implants are out, and it is an immense relief to not have that implant poking through my muscle or my chest muscles pulling and spasming on the outer side of my chest due to the capsular contracture. The PS said both capsules were quite thick. I received the full proactive treatment with Dr. Massey and staff. Both arms were wrapped by Dr. Massey, BP taken on calf, IV in neck. No questions asked. What I found most interesting is how Dr. Massey tailored my surgery so that it would have the least impact on my LE. In order to remove all the extra skin that had been created for the implant, she would have had to create large incisions that ran around the side of my chest. After seeing that the side of my chest is my main LE area, she decided against that kind of incision since it might disrupt the pathway I've been using for MLD. Instead, she cut a two inch incision on each side closer toward the sternum. She also placed the drains below the breast area vs the side since the scar from that might effect the MLD path. She had said I might need a second surgery to make everything tidy, but that she'd be able to do that with only a small incision and wouldn't effect my LE. I wasn't keen on a second surgery but knew she was right about protecting my MLD path. Post surgery, my arms were unwrapped. Dr. Massey reported she was pleased with the results and said I probably wouldn't need a second surgery. Going to see how the skin shrinks and everything heals. I know this seems crazy, but I actually think my chest LE is down even though I had surgery in the immediate area. My arm is fine, and both of my hands feel like my \"old\" hands. It's clear my body didn't want these implants in me and is happy they're gone. haven't felt emotional about the loss of my implants - guess I mourned when I made the decision to deconstruct and in the days leading up to the surgery. I'm just incredibly happy to feel good again. Can't imagine I'm going to feel even better once the incisions heal. Had MLD the day after my surgery and today, and I'm scheduled for MLD every day next week. One drain will probably be removed when I see Dr. Massey on Monday, but I'm hoping the second one cooperates and can go at the same time. Time to take my meds and get some rest. Looking forward to catching up on the discussions here. I've missed you guys! Tina",

I have had such a great experience here. I've been scheduled for daily MLD sessions with the therapist since being released from the hospital. She has been very good. I was so elated by the relief I felt from the removal of my implants, that it took me a while to bottom out. Dr. Massey had warned me I'd probably have some crying spells, but I was still surprised when they came on like a great flood. I was already tired of being a patient, had become cranky and weepy by the time I had my first appt with Dr. Massey after being released from the hospital. After she removed one drain, she explained exactly what she found during surgery and what she had been able to repair. It was clear a lot of damage had occurred during the expansion phase, and it's no wonder since it was painful as hell. Anyway, some of the muscle couldn't be repaired because it was so thin and wispy. As a result, for now I have a little ledge above my incision that may or may not retract and lie flat. We are hoping I don't need to return for a second surgery. Anyway, I think it finally sunk in exactly what I had subjected my body to. I have been having great feelings of regret for what I have done to myself, even though I know I made the best decision I could during a stressful time. I thought I was informed, but obviously not as much as I could have been. It's going to take some time to come to terms with the body I have been left with, and I know I need to be patient and give it six months to allow the skin and muscle time to retract (like a tummy after pregnancy). However, I am going to need to work on trying to forgive myself. I am so upset that I wasn't just grateful enough to beat cancer, but had to have boobs, too. I almost passed on the recon, and it was always my plan to never replace implants when their shelf life expired. I wish I had just known better. So much wasted time and pain. I had one drain removed the day before yesterday, and yesterday morning I woke up with some swelling - bad side of trunk. It was a rainy day, I've been slipping on hydration and it's been difficult to control salt. Anyway, the therapist wrapped my trunk and put yellow foam inserts on the sides below my arm pits. No fun with that remaining drain pinching underneath, as well as the bandaged drain site. Slept very poorly last night. Wore my tank and swell spots to therapy today to show therapist my original compression treatment garment. She liked it and said was okay if I preferred over wrapping. Bad news: four months again with the compression until everything settles down from surgery. Another blow to my fragile emotional state, and I slept poorly with the foam pressing on the edges of my back or firmly against my side. Ah, well. I know I came to the best place possible for LE care and surgery, so even though it's going to be a little while to get back to my pre-surgery state, I know I'm in better shape than if I had stayed local for the surgery.",

I am trying to take it one day at a time and think positively. Some days I'm more successful than others. I think the physical stuff, still feeling somewhat bruised and raw - or having more sensation - combined with antibiotics that never agree with me, make me feel beaten down. Looking at all the extra skin and muscle that was left in order to avoid a longer incision in the LE area of my chest is just difficult to take. In contrast, yesterday I walked five miles with my husband, and today we did almost four. And, this morning at the LE therapist I was back down 2cm to my original post-surgery measurement. I do better when I keep myself busy, and I think when I get back home I'll feel better. Living out of a hotel room without a car and needing a cab to get places makes me feel I don't have much control. The salt factor has been difficult to control, and I am tired of restaurant food. My husband bought me a silver necklace yesterday - he was worried I wouldn't have anything positive to associate with Charleston. It is a stark contrast to our first trip here together 11 years ago. What a difference a decade can make! We were at such a different point in our lives, and we've both gone through so many changes. DH doesn't have to worry; I will always love Charleston. It is such a beautiful city. How can you not love the place Dr. Massey calls home!",

Cancer didn't even teach this lesson. LE imposed limits on what I could do, taking away many of my most favorite activities. I was devastated and mourned these losses. By the time I was 50, I had pretty much settled into enjoying an assortment of things that I knew brought me pleasure. I was very confused during the first year of adapting to LE, repeatedly discovering things I could no longer do. The big things were readily apparent, but the small things took longer to unfold and become obvious. I mourned as each was discovered. By the end of the year, I took an account of the list of activities I could no longer do, and it made me very sad. I remember sitting and thinking and crying. I knew my life had to go on - here I am after cancer and I am alive and healthy. I have a husband who loves me and a great group of friends and family. It suddenly occurred to me that it's a big world out there, and there are millions of things to do and enjoy. I could remain fixed on the things I can no longer do, or I could go out and discover new things that I CAN do. Just what a 50 yr old woman needs after becoming pretty comfortable with particular likes and dislikes - kind of boring, safe, and spoiled. I decided to let the remainder of my life be the time I use to explore new and different things. Either activities I didn't think I would like, or those that I hadn't even thought of or known about. It's been a real eye opener. It's sort of like being a kid again, willing to try and anticipate that I will have fun. And I have found that some of the newest things I've discovered are really wonderful. And I am grateful that I gave myself the chance to experience these things. Life is an adventure again. Also:   I think having LE has made me have to think more creatively. I've learned I have to let my needs be known and allow myself to appear more vulnerable in front of people. I've learned that people only know you as well as you let them. I think that is one of the things that makes our group here so wonderful. I've never met any of you in person, but I feel very close to all of you because you have so personally revealed yourselves. You are beautiful, and it is truly a privilege to know you. I have never met such compassionate and thoughtful women.",

Advocate reviewed info he sent to committee and did a great job. I did a quick summary of the makeshift getup I currently wear at night and why it's not very effective. The only questions they asked were: 1) the advocate's relationship to me, whether he received payment; 2) info on clinical trials about the vest; and 3) info on peer reviewed journal articles. Little info on clinical trials or published peer articles exist, so we will be surprised if they approve. Will go to next level, if necessary.

I wasn't sure how much relief I'd experience after the implants were removed, as a couple of PS's I consulted warned I may have post-mastectomy pain syndrome. Well, it was all implant pain, and now that they are gone, the scar tissue removed, and muscle repaired as much as possible on both sides, I am 100% pain free! Upon awaking from surgery, I could tell right away that much of the pain was gone. The post-surgery pain wasn't much worse than the implants! I am almost 10 weeks post surgery, and I feel like a new woman. There's no pain in my chest, and my back, neck and shoulder muscles are no longer tight. I have started to slowly exercise, and it feels good. I do have concavity in both sides of my chest where the expanders pressed on my ribcage. It's not quite the smooth and flat results I had hoped for, but I have adjusted to my appearance. I have't been wearing a prosthetic and I am happy with how I look in clothes.",

I remember thinking before my surgery that if I felt 75% or even 50% better, then I would be happy with the results. Never in a million years did I think I would feel as good as I do. I believe there are people who have pain and problems that are completely implant related. Unfortunately, there's no way to know for sure unless you remove them. I had a gut feeling that all the chest muscle spasming and stabbing pain where I could feel the implant, and the tightness in my back, neck and shoulders were from the implants. The implants were noticeably misshapen, which was another indication. I consulted with two PTs and a physiatrist, who evaluated my body, and they thought I was right. I knew the implants were at least part of the problem, and because I wasn't willing to live with the pain anymore, any improvement would be a positive. My LE is easier to manage. I thought everything going on on the side of my trunk was LE related, but it turns out that half of the numb-y feeling I had was due to the implant. I can feel more and focus more accurately on the areas that need the most attention. There's no way to know exactly what's causing all of your pain, but please don't give up or think that you will never feel better. It is possible for your whole body, mind and soul to heal - I am living proof of that, and I hope you will soon have the chance to recover, too.",

I had one for a week, and the other for almost two weeks. I probably would have had the second one removed a little earlier, but I got all gung ho and walked 5 miles two days in a row and that increased the output. The trick is to get some exercise every day, but not so much that it raises the output. Same thing as after the mastectomy - output has to be under 30cc for at least 3 days in a row before drain can be removed.  Laura, I think you're right about steering away from multiple surgeries when you have LE. That advice was given to me by a few professionals. More surgeries equal more scar tissue, which is definitely not good with LE. Did you see my thread on the LE forum that I started when I had my surgery? I must have mentioned Dr. Massey removed my implants - I feel like a broken record singing her praises. She was so careful about my LE. I will bump up my thread (\"Surgery finally happening\") in case you haven't seen. I also posted on the Charleston Bound 2 thread. While you may feel stuck because you have limited choices where you are located, maybe your insurance will grant an exception if you need to travel out of network to have surgery done by someone who can provide the best care for your LE . ",

I hope your bruising and swelling goes down.   I've been a member of the photo forum since 2008 when I had my BM, expansion and permanent implants. It's been such a wonderful place for support. I just visited the forum and had another look at the \"Au Naturel\" board since I hadn't been there for a while and wondered if there were any new pictures. That board doesn't get nearly as much action as the recon one. It got me thinking that if any of the women here who have deconstructed were interested, it would be so helpful and reassuring to see pictures of your results. Or you could feel free to PM me a pic if you didn't want to post. Just a thought, but I appreciate everyone's comments. Hipchick, I have been thinking about the drs. in New Orleans. Their results are amazing. One of the women from the lymphedema forum just had surgery there and she talked about how they took such excellent care of her pre, during, and post surgery. It made me think that might be the best place for me to go as far as best results for deconstructing and LE care. Wonder if my insurance will cover it.",

The clothing thing, ugh! Right there with you on that. I am a member of the photo forum, and I just couldn't spend any time there for quite a while. It was too depressing with pics of all the wonderful results. On the reconstruction threads, I no longer had anything to contribute and didn't want to sound like a \"downer\". I, too, wondered how I got here and sometimes regretted my decision. The drs. made it sound so easy . . . Sure, I read the risks, but I've always been fit and healthy and assumed I would be fine. I think having immediate recon is somewhat like having a safety net as far as emotionally dealing with the loss of your breasts. The loss is there, but recon gives us something to focus on, to look forward to. And it's marketed as a prize - like a boob job or once again having the boobs from your youth. Well, when the safety net is drawn away, the emotional pain of losing our breasts surfaces again. We also worry about what we will look like if we deconstruct - worse than if we never had recon? Well, I've been living for two years with pain, disfigured implants and lymphedema. Perhaps a long, drawn out process is worse than just a quick \"off with their heads\". I mourned when I finally decided to deconstruct - worries about my appearance, as well as concern over whether surgery would make my lymphedema worse. Well, they have to come out sometime, so they might as well be now. At this point, the process has become debilitating for me, and I need to get back with living and thinking about other things. So, I am finally ready to go - let the chips fall where they may.  Anne, I wish I could help take away that ashamed feeling. The problems of the recon are not your fault. Someone on another thread likened recon to a crap shoot. There is a percentage of people who will develop problems after recon - it's just a fact. WE are not failures. Our bodies didn't take to the process, and we don't need to blame ourselves. I know my PS wouldn't say it was HIS failure, so why should I? And you don't need to shoulder any blame for what happened to you, either. I know you will come to decide what's right for you with this process, Anne. I wish you peace and clarity, and freedom from the physical part of this. The women on this forum are quite helpful with info about prosthetics, dressing, and have a great attitude about living breast free. If having breasts is important to you, then please know there are many other procedures out there besides implants. I don't have experience or detailed knowledge of them, but the women on the recon forum will gladly help provide info on these other techniques.  Tina ",

I will make sure to watch for cellulitis. I do have a few capsules of clindamycin on hand for dental and GI procedures since I have implants, mitral valve prolapse and I'm allergic to Keflex. I happen to have my annual appt. with my gynecologist tomorrow morning, so if there is an antibiotic that is best for fending off cellulitis, I would have the opportunity to ask her for a script while I'm there. It really makes sense to have that on hand in case of an emergency. What you're saying about the inflammatory response being in high gear makes sense. I usually limit the amount of ibuprofen I take after developing an NSAID induced ulcer a few years ago. Naproxen is out because that definitely tears up my stomach, but a little bit of ibuprofen carefully spaced out seems to be okay. I haven't had the need to take more than my itty bitty doses occasionally so I never noticed whether it increased swelling for me. I hadn't even heard about its possible effect on LE until recently.  Sounds like the benedryl, sudafed or mucinex are okay as long as I stay hydrated. I've been taking the benedryl at night since it helps me sleep and taking the sudafed during the day since it keeps me awake. Both drugs taken at the same time make me feel like a wacko, which is sort of where I am at this point after taking both several days in a row. I will have to check my drug cabinet to see what I have on hand - I may have a bottle of some allergy med I decided was the least offensive as far as side effects. I do so poorly with drugs, so I usually save old prescription bottles so I can remember what is actually okay for me to take. Fortunately, the benedryl isn't an issue since I'm not taking tamoxifen. I'm also going to pick up a neti pot at the drug store tomorrow after my appt.  Kira, thank you again for your help.

Well, after using it, I felt out of sorts so I compared the label against my empty can of Simply Saline. I noticed the benzo-stuff you mentioned and figured that must be the cause. Sometimes I really hate having a body that is so sensitive to drugs, but I guess that can be a good thing.  I think having BC makes us all a bit crazy when it comes to tests and being in the role of the patient. I don't trust my body, and I don't always trust my drs. It all makes for a little insanity now and then - just to keep life interesting! Thanks for the well wishes! Tina ",

      "Content": "Nov 6, 2011 11:20AM - edited Nov 6, 2011 11:21AM by Tina337 I would be interested to know if in general I should refrain from doing that, as I sometimes feel the need to stretch my chest and neck because of the scarring I developed from the reconstruction. When I had my implants, it pulled my shoulders and everything forward and down due to their weight, capsular contracture and scar tissue. When I had the implants removed and the muscles put back in their normal position and tacked to the chest wall, my chest felt so much more \"open\" and I could breathe more easily. I have been to my myofascial release therapist and he has worked on my chest twice since the surgery. First time was about 10 wks after, and then again this past week. I had definitely tightened up somewhat, but nothing like when I had the implants. Anyway, toward the end of the session, he worked on the area just above the breast area, and I could feel the tightness all the way into my neck. Obviously, this is all connected. So, I want to go back again and have him work some more on this area. Then I probably wouldn't feel the need to lean my head back to stretch my neck and upper chest. I am now wondering if there are stretches that safely address the neck and upper chest. For me, this is just another example of how implant recon really messes with the structure of your body and is not the simple surgery that plastic surgeons suggest it is.",

Boy, this sure wasn't what we had in mind after going through that grueling process, was it? I will have to forego the nipple recon and 3D tattoos, as it's too much of a risk with my truncal LE. I have CC in my right implant, but I'm trying to avoid surgery to replace. Have been doing myofascial therapy, which has helped a lot with the pain and appearance of the implant. So for now, that's the track I'm on. I still struggle a little emotionally with my results since I no longer can wear a bra. My LE physiatrist and LE therapist actually agreed that I do better without anything at this point, so I really shouldn't complain. The bun shape implants and the CC in the right side have made dressing tricky. After having meltdown after meltdown when I tried to get dressed, I finally went through my closets and drawers and threw out anything that made me cry. I don't look or feel like I thought I would at the end of all this, but, hey, I'm here. I think the first summer with LE is the worst. I was in the middle of the intensive treatment phase last July and August, and flaring big time. To top it off, I was really uncomfortable and hot with the compression garments and phasing into menopause. Relatively speaking, this summer seems much better. I'm not flaring as much, but it's probably because I have the tools for self care and have had a good amount of time to determine things that help and things to avoid. I think emotionally, last summer was awful because everything was such a big unknown, and I had had to fight my drs. to get the right treatment. I hadn't even fully gotten used to having new boobs, and then wham! it was LE and CC time. Thanks to all the wonderful women on this forum, I was pointed in the right direction and gained insight into what the future might be and became hopeful that I, too, could learn to manage chronic LE. I still hate it - even fear it - but I've come just a little closer to accepting what I have been through and where I am.",

I don't seem to have the mental energy to find the info about medications that may increase LE. I need your help because I can barely see through my blurry eyes and runny nose. For my foot, I have been wrapping with an ace bandage, but I will need to call the dr. tomorrow. It doesn't feel right and is still swelling. I resorted to ibuprofen a few times to reduce inflamation and pain. Also, with these allergies that hit me out of nowhere this week - DH and others are complaining - I ended up taking some benedryl and sudafed (original formula). I have problems with allergy meds and they make me feel weird so I am limited in what I can take - no prescription stuff. The other option I have is mucinex instead of sudafel. I realized I probably needed to drink a lot more water than I have been because all these drugs are dehydrating. Have been doing that all day today. Anyway, the important point, is that coinciding with my foot and these extreme allergies, I have also flared big time in the side of my chest. Have resorted to wearing my compression camisole and soft spot inserts. Doing MLD 2xday.  Someone please help me figure out if the medications I've been taking are on that list of drugs that may cause an increase in LE for some folks.  Any other insight would be appreciated. I do not feel this swelling is unusually hot, nor does it look red or splotchy, so I am not thinking cellulitis. I am bummed because I have gone all summer with no major flare, and yet, here it is.

By the way, I believe you are correct in understanding that at this point Dr. Massey is only taking on extreme cases of LE for this kind of surgery. Will you be part of Dr. Vasile's clinical trial? Also, would Dr. Becker or another surgeon be performing the surgery in tandem with Dr. Vasile? One surgeon works on preparing the axillary area (removing scar tissue) that will receive the node, while another surgeon is removing node from inguinal nodes on opposite side of body.

I've ended up doing better without anything, but sometimes I need some compression. Ultimately, I'd like to get a custom Solaris vest to wear at night. I've taken a couple of my Maidenform Control-it tanks and cut them off to create a bralette, but the bottom curls after wearing a few times. Unfortunately, that ends up making it feel kind of binding. If I could find some kind of band to sew to the bottom that's not tight and would lie flat, I'd be golden. The fabric doesn't run when you cut it. I'm just not that good of a seamstress to figure out how to work with this super stretchy material. I wear the tank that has the shirring in the center and wide straps. It's not perfect for me as far as fit in the underarm area, but it's been better than anything else I've tried. Isn't there some kind of adhesive that women use at the top of their sleeves that might help something like this stay flat? It might be a good temporary fix since the fabric doesn't roll right away. Thanks for the info on Memoi. Waiting for this downpour to end so I can head out on my expedition! ",

Because of my truncal LE, I won't know if I'll be able to wear prosthetics until after the surgery. I'm trying not to think too much about it right now since it's something I don't have any control over and will just deal with when the time comes. I wouldn't mind being able to wear a small prosthetic under dressier things or if I need to conceal a concave area. It's really interesting what you bring up about tossing all the old clothes that no longer work and the contrast of looking in the mirror and sometimes seeing yourself with boobs and at other times flat. I really get what you're saying with regard to both. Besides the physical pain with which I've been living, I've found it so frustrating and depressing to go through so many wardrobe changes in the past two years. When I first had my bilateral mast and had to go a month with empty expanders, I just adapted and found clothes that worked. I never stuffed, not even to balance the two sides as they expanded over five months. I got to be pretty good at \"smoke and mirrors\" dressing. I actually was so happy to be cancer-free that I didn't feel too bad about losing my breasts - but, of course, I had that safety net of the \"boobs\" that were yet to come. After my exchange surgery, the shirts I wore prior to my BM no longer fit! The PS made me slightly larger than I was prior, so I had to throw away clothes that were too small. It took me a few months to find a few bras that actually fit and then new tops that fit. Within six months I developed lymphedema and was put in a compression tank 24/7 for seven months. I was told I could not wear the bras I had purchased. It was back to smoke and mirrors dressing because the tank did nothing for my implants or new tops. Fast forward to the end of LE treatment, the tank was driving me nuts and the therapist told me to wear nothing. Well, going braless was certainly a relief, but my implants have a bun shape and don't look great without a bra. So now I'm into another wardrobe change and finally kind of have an idea of what works - more smoke and mirrors. I have found this need to modify my wardrobe and undergarments numerous times over the past two years utterly exhausting!! It's also been heartbreaking to watch my implants become distorted. I just need to know what body I'm going to see when I look in the mirror. And I need to know when I look in my closet that I can wear my clothes and feel good in them. I want to throw out more clothes, but I'm waiting until I know whether or not I can wear prosthetics. If I end up going formless anyway, then I'll have an idea of what works and what doesn't. I'm still waiting for the \"new normal\". Whew! Thanks for letting me vent! Tina ",

Perhaps because I have some loose skin and muscle, maybe I don't see this? Perhaps it's different for those who are deconstructing. The plastic surgeon who removed my implants said that my pectoral muscle had been \"released\" by the inframammary fold. While she permanently tacked my muscle down to my chest wall similarly to how it was before the recon, there is some extra or a little bit of slack muscle near my inframammary fold. There's more on the left side because I always had more skin there and the implant was larger on that side to correct what my original PS said was an imbalance in my chest. Anyway, my right side had muscle damage and it couldn't be tacked down in quite the same way as the left, so there is a little less slack on that side. If I didn't have some concavity in the middle from the stupid expanders, I might look like I had mini boobs! In either event, I have always had a slight pectoral excavatum that I hated, but now it actually works to my advantage because it gives the impression of some cleavage. What was once seen as a negative is now a positive! Funny, huh?",

I'm sure you don't look like a man. I have had guys look at my flat chest if I'm wearing a tee to a baseball game or other times when I'm dressed down. It's not the same as being called sir, but I know they know I don't have any breasts and it sometimes makes me feel uncomfortable. I remind myself that people generally don't mean to be rude and stare. However, I think it's the same thing that you and Lilylady have pointed out about how much effort you want to put into how you look at times. When I wear more feminine tops that distract from my flatness, I rarely get the stare. I just know that when I wear certain tops, I have to be prepared for some extended looks. I really am okay with my flat chest, especially since it was such a hard road to get here. I think it's when something like that catches me off guard, it can cause a mix of emotions. It's been easier as time passes though. When I head out into the world with my flat chest shirt, I often give myself a little \"I am woman, hear me roar\" pep talk. Here's something kind of funny. I have a man's tee I bought for myself right before my deconstruction surgery to help me feel positive. The design on the front of it: a large Superman emblem. :-)",

You may be surprised at what works without and with forms. I'd even give it a good six weeks before pitching anything, as you may still have swelling for a while. You may find that things that don't look good at first are fine later. In general, I discovered that dresses and blouses that have darts were the worst without forms. I'm sure those styles will work with a prosthetic though. I have lymphedema issues and probably will only wear a small form if that's possible. My old dresses would be a little too big in the bust, so that's why I consigned them. However, I tried everything on first, and I was glad I did since my favorite vintage dress actually still looks great. I didn't expect that at all. Most of my new things have shirring, details near the neckline, ruffles, pattern, or are worn in layers. However, that doesn't mean if one looks at me closely that they can't tell I am flat. Some things make me look small busted, and with others I just throw caution to the wind and put my flat chest out there. I still look nice in what I am wearing, but I don't have breasts. Just as you did pre-mast and then with implants, you learn to find clothes that flatter your body type and highlight your best features. I'm sure others will chime in on how to work with the camis and prosthetics",

My surgeon told me to expect to \"crash and burn\" and that I needed to allow myself to take the time to grieve. She was right, and I did go through a mourning process very much like the mastectomy. It definitely is a period of adjustment, but I think after a couple more weeks as you start to feel even better and become accustomed to your new chest, you will feel more at peace. If you ever need to talk, please feel free to PM me. Let me tell you, out of all the summers to be without boobs, this is it when it comes to clothes! NJVictoria mentioned ruffled blouses, and yes, they are everywhere. Also, lots of tops with shirring, smocking, patterns, etc. It's a flat chest bonanza out there right now! I went on a buying spree when some stores had sales and also had luck at TJ Maxx. And there are light, soft and swingy things to wear over the shirred tanks. Short sleeved sweaters work well, too. Layering helps soften and detract from the flatness. I made myself try on all sorts of tops, even things I normally wouldn't wear. I was surprised that things I thought would look bad actually were great. In general, things with darts don't work as well. There are a couple of threads on this forum that discuss tips for dressing form-free. They are helpful and inspiring. Shippy, during this adjustment while you are processing things emotionally and getting used to finding clothes that work, remind yourself that you have just been through a really big surgery and change. You had BC and then had to deconstruct. Pat yourself on the back and give yourself credit for making it through all this. You are strong and amazing. And to answer your question, yes, I still see boobs everywhere! I will have twinges of wishing I had my old pre-cancer body, but then I take a deep breath and remind myself I am still alive, healthy and a strong woman. More importantly, I tell myself I am not my breasts or implants. I stand up straight and walk with pride, as this is still my life and I am going to live it! My PS said it was fine to get the drain sites wet while showering but to keep them covered with a bandage until they closed. It seems like PSs have their own methods and instructions - I would follow the instructions you were given since your PS knows what he did to you during surgery.",

I had a closet full of dresses from my pre-BM days, along with three I purchased post-BM when I was in the early expansion phase of my recon. Two were purchased for a wedding and the other for a family event. I can still wear those three dresses today after having my implants removed and going flat. The rest of my dresses no longer worked, and I had to let them go. I spent one morning trying on everything and ended up in a puddle of tears. You just have to try on a lot of things and see what works. For me, a dress that has a less fitted top with some kind of distracting detail and a fitted waist works best. I have found that a variety of styles can work, as long as the fit and proportions are right. When I had breasts, not every dress I tried fit well, regardless of the style. Same thing is true being flat. Three dresses in the same style may not have the same proportions, so it pays to at least try a couple in each style so you get a sense of whether the fit is off or if the style itself doesn't work. We've all had to dress to play up our good features and minimize others. It's the same game with an additional factor. I promised myself that if I couldn't find clothes I love on my own, that I would take advantage of a personal shopper. Macy's and other dept stores will provide assistance if you make an appt. I know I'm definitely going to use this for winter clothes and when I need to revamp my work wardrobe.",

Mine is more in the center of where the implants used to be, with extra muscle above and below. I still think the muscle will retract further and lie flatter once I exercise those muscles more. Sometimes I wonder if that stuff might be fat or extra skin, but when I give it a little pinch, it definitely feels like muscle. Or, when I flex my pectoral muscles, it retracts more. I'm only three months post deconstruction, and my PS said to give it six months for the muscle to retract.  I can't help with the forms, because I don't have any yet. I'm really groovin' on going flat right now. I feel so free after all that implant and muscle pain. I am starting to forget about my flatness at times, which I think is a good sign!

Finally decided on the surgeon, and I am scheduled to have my implants removed April 5. Such a relief to be finished with the info gathering process. Not looking forward to another surgery, but sure looking forward to feeling better. One of the PS's noted that not only do I have capsular contracture, but the part of the implant that's been killing me and feels like it's poking and migrating toward the center of my chest has actually pushed through part of the muscle. Apparently something that can happen to anyone. Lucky me. At least I know why it hurts like hell! Rosemary, I can relate to everything you're saying. Once I decided I needed to have my implants removed, it was like revisiting the mastectomy all over. I went through a mourning process for about two weeks. I'm sure I'll be there again once they are actually removed. It definitely is an adjustment, but it sounds like you have a good attitude and supportive husband. Being able to get back to doing and enjoying the things you love is really what it's all about. I hope everything heals well and you are feeling great soon! Thanks for sharing your experience.  Laura, my myofascial therapist says that it's not unusual for women who have reconstruction or augmentation to experience back, neck and shoulder pain after the process. The additional weight changes your body's center of gravity and the way it's used to carrying itself. My implants are similar in size to my original breasts, but they are much heavier. One of the PS's I interviewed said that removing the implants may not eliminate the pain and mentioned post-mastectomy pain syndrome. I know women can have that, but there's a difference between that kind of pain and pressure/pain from implants. I, too, agree that it's really unnatural to have these things forced under the chest muscle. I don't know why it didn't seem so apparent when I was making that decision. I try to remember that the BC diagnosis was a whirlwind of activity - we made a decision that seemed best during this stressful time.  Linda, I'm glad to hear you look so good after your surgery. I cannot believe you endured all those procedures! I'm sure it's great to finally be done with all that and pain free. Sofiajane, I don't know where you are in the process or what you've decided, but I hope you are doing well. I want to thank you for starting this thread so that the women here who have chosen to remove their implants and go flat have a place to share their experiences. ",

It's a shame my original PS and BS were of little help with regard to LE care or diagnosing my implant issue. Thinking about this reminds me of a discussion I need to have with my BS when I see him next. My unaddressed problem needs to come full circle as a learning experience for him and his team. Knowing what I now know, I am glad I didn't opt for revisions suggested by local PS's, and instead had an excellent surgeon perform a deconstruction. It cost me pain, time, and a lot of money, but at least I avoided further disaster. I have been bitter about my local care, but being where I am physically today makes me grateful for the way things played out. So, no more bitterness, but feedback so another patient doesn't have this experience.",

I know some of us tend to scar more than others, but I'm curious about where it is, how it feels, looks, etc.  I didn't have rads or chemo, so I'm hoping my body is just rejecting the implants. The strange thing about the CC, is that my mastectomy scars have practically disappeared! My scarring is the capsule itself, or perhaps the capsule has adhered to the pectoral or serratus muscle or to the chest wall. I have had myofascial release therapy and found it helped break down the scarring quite a bit. It didn't work as well on the capsule itself, but it did on the areas surrounding the implant, and esp. my back, neck and shoulders. I'm hoping I won't need it any more after the implants are gone. However, I've talked with my therapist, and I definitely would have to wait at least six weeks if I did want him to work on me post surgery.  Thanks again for sharing, as it continues to buoy my spirits and makes me eager to have this over with. Now if it weren't for this damn lymphedema, I'd probably have the surgery scheduled already. Need to interview PS's first and then I can get going. ",

It is my understanding that compression garments help prevent further swelling, while the drainage exercises are necessary to reduce swelling, especially in the initial stages of treatment. If you pop on over to the lymphdema forum, there are knowledgeable women there who can answer many of your questions.

I thought about it occasionally from November through March - the months I endured a protracted diagnostic process. Yes, I found out I had DCIS in November and it took four more months to determine what else I might have and where - a total of 5 more biopsies scheduled between Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, etc. What a nightmare time that was. Anyway, this past April I noticed was feeling kind of crappy emotionally, and it suddenly dawned on me I had missed my anniversary. While I was pleased I had been focused on living that day, not what the date had meant in the past, I knew my body remembered and it had played a role in my having a low week. Faith, I lost my breath when I read your post about \"So what did you do to yourself?\" You know, I've said that to myself periodically over the last two years. I will go in and out of blaming myself for having LE. Intellectually, logically, I know there's no way to know whether I would have had LE without it, but there's a chance my reconstruction was responsible. I had a very hard time with the expansion - in comparison to the fact that I felt pretty darn wonderful right after the BM and healed quickly. By the 3rd expansion, however, I was in a lot of pain, and by the 5th, I was out of my mind until the exchange surgery. Did this process interfere with the lymphatics in my trunk? I will never know. Maybe it was the sentinel node biopsy. Maybe it was all the other freakin' biopsies leading up the BM. There's no way to ever know the cause, but sometimes I wonder if I had \"just left well enough alone\" I might have been fine. If I'm being particularly cruel to myself, I'll think about \"How selfish and vain I was to not just go flat\" or \"Why couldn't I just be content with being healthy and alive?\" I've learned to quickly divert thoughts like these because nothing good can come of them. I remind myself I made an amazing choice. After 4 mths of testing, I was told I didn't need a BM, just a lumpectomy in one breast. However, I had been brave and done what I thought was the right thing for my long-term health. And you know what? The pathologist found two areas of DCIS (one in each breast) that hadn't shown up on any of the tests. And about the recon? Well, I am still relatively young and deserve to feel good about my body (in clothes and in the bedroom), and I made the choice that felt right at the time. I don't regret that. Yes, Faith, you are so right. We didn't do anything to ourselves. Thank you for saying that loud and clear for all of us to hear. Laura, I think most all of us can relate to your \"Do as I say, not as I do\". I still have a very hard time staying proactive and practicing self MLD exercises. I guess it is somewhat of a maturing process to come to grips with being handed a lifelong medical condition after we have just made it through a life threatening one. I am still in my infancy!    This is why I try and equate in my mind that having LE is like having heart disease or diabetes. If was told I had one of these conditions and instructed to take a medication, follow a certain diet and/or exercise regimen, it might take me a while to come to terms with it, but I would probably comply because I know it's good for my health. I do my best. Sometimes it's not what I \"should\" be doing ideally, but I know that I am the one who will suffer the consequences. It really is an ongoing mourning process, but at some point I had to pick myself up and decide to parent myself responsibly. I still have meltdowns, forget or neglect to do the right things, but I am trying, and I will continue to try. That is why I am so grateful to this forum - because you all help keep me on track.  Kane, I'm still basically on house arrest, too. I let myself go to the supermarket this w/e and it was relatively cool enough for a short walk in the shade on Sat. I did have some swelling afterward, but so be it. And tonight, well, tonight I am letting myself out to go to a concert. And I am hoping that my recently healed foot will allow me to dance just a little bit and enjoy myself! ",

      "Content": "Jun 5, 2011 10:02AM - edited Jun 5, 2011 10:31AM by Tina337 Shippy, you actually have already begun the process of adjusting to becoming flat even though you haven't had surgery. For me, once I decided I needed to deconstruct, I felt quite sad for two weeks. I mourned the failure of my reconstruction, the time lost by the experience and the pain it had caused me. I was fearful of the unknown, what I would look like and how would I handle it. It is very unsettling. My advice during this time is to allow yourself to feel however you do, and at the same time try to continue the positive things you are doing, such as research about forms, bras, etc. There is a great thread here about dressing without forms, and I found that very reassuring. In my mind, there are two dimensions to this adjustment of deconstruction, just as in a mastectomy. The first is how you feel about how you look naked, and the second is how you feel about how you look dressed. The naked part also involves intimacy issues and can take a little while to adjust, but the dressing part can provide a tremendous boost in your mood. Since you walk around clothed most of the time and that affects how you feel about yourself and how you perceive others see you, I think dealing with this part is an important one. At least it was for me. Now that I am close to pulling together a new wardrobe that supports my new body (includes some old stuff), I am feeling much better. With all the things I could no longer wear removed from my closet, psychologically I feel much better when I wake and decide what to wear for the day. It's fun to get dressed and put together an outfit again. The PS who removed my implants and couldn't make me as neat and tidy as I had wanted because of my lymphedema issues, gently warned me I would go through a mourning process post surgery and to allow myself the time to grieve and just feel how I felt. She said it was normal. I would have to agree this is very much how I felt post surgery - not at first because I was so happy to be pain free, but once the reality of how I looked really hit me and I learned why I had been in so much pain (implant poking through muscle, muscle severely damaged and not totally repairable, extent of capsular contracture, and how the recon had permanently changed my musculature and ribcage). I still have some loose skin and muscle - PS wanted to be careful about incisions near my LE area, which was very wise - and I have concave areas in my ribcage from the expanders. As far as how it felt phyically post surgery to have the implants removed, it was much easier than the mastectomy with expanders placed, and it was also easier than my exchange surgery. I felt the best I had prior to any surgery, and that was with the post surgery pain. I could breathe more fully, my muscle over my chest felt normal again, and my implant pain was completely gone. I have continued to feel better and better as the weeks go by. Week six I noticed an improvement in some of the loose muscle and skin and even more lung expansion. It was the turning point for me, and at eight weeks post op I feel so incredibly well. For me, this overrides any disappointment about my appearance. I am trying to be patient and realistic at the same time, but I am hoping that over the next four months things will continue to improve. Everyone - even strangers - have noted how happy I look. You bet I am! Such a relief to be free of pain and worry. Just as it takes some time to adjust to seeing yourself minus your breasts and then with your implants, it takes some time to adjust to seeing yourself with nothing. It's not an overnight process, but it does happen.",

I ended up between two women and proceeded to talk with one almost the entire flight. She was friendly and nice. Talked about all kinds of stuff, but at one point she mentioned her sister had had breast cancer and that she had helped care for her after surgery. Sister had had implant recon. I inquired about her health and congratulated her on her sister's recovery. Because I had my sleeve and glove on, I said I had had BC and developed lymphedema. Also told her about my failed implant recon and how I had had my implants removed and was now going flat. Not that I needed comforting, but she didn't acknowledge my experience, but instead said that her sister is fine and happy with implants and recon. I'm sure it was one of those \"you can't cure stupid\" moments and she didn't mean anything insensitive by it. So I told her it's just a fact that implant recon doesn't always work out for everyone, and I'm grateful to finally be out of pain and okay without fake boobs. I am pretty tired of the denial of all things negative that accompany BC - by friends, relatives, strangers, and even fellow women who have had BC. Lymphedema happens, but we don't have the plague. Reconstruction fails and for some women the best choice is to let go of that and move on. Likewise, some women never want reconstruction, and there is certainly nothing odd or wrong with that. I'm okay with recon - obviously, because I chose it - but since when is it strange to not want recon, or to actually be okay with your body when things fail? And when it comes to acknowledging LE, I've had the experience of Komen volunteers at a local park look at me, eye my flat chest, then look at my sleeve and glove and look away. Yeah, they're all about the cure, but you can't cure LE, so they can't bear to acknowledge. Crystalphm - Yes, you've got that right! We didn't get to keep our breasts, but we got to keep our life. I feel that I still have a miraculous body that is capable of bringing me joy, pleasure, and the ability to take me places, because I certainly am not done living just because I don't have breasts or fake breasts. LE is a PIA and it sucks, but I'm not giving up living because of that either.",

There were gnats, but I didn't feel like I was bit by anything. Husband got NO bites and wore no bug spray. The next day I discover I have about seven bites on my legs, two on my \"good\" arm, but none on my node side. I should have known better than to stay as long as we did. I was having a good time visiting with folks I hadn't seen in a while. I don't like getting bites on my good side because even though I didn't have nodes removed, I do have some truncal LE in that side. All bites were washed and neosporin applied. Later, I applied benedryl lotion. I am not scratching! I need to find something more powerful. Off topic, but can anyone recommend a deodorant that works well that isn't all chemically?",

How wonderful to be done and free of all that worry!  I'm actually quite happy and relieved to see your post, because after the new year I am planning on having my implants removed and going flat. I had bilateral mast with expanders in April 2008, and exchanged to silicone implants in Sept. 2008. Within 6 mths, I developed capsular contracture in the right side, and now have the beginning of CC in the left. I also developed truncal lymphedema in the right side around the time the CC started. I have done myofascial therapy for over a year in an attempt to reduce the scarring and get relief from the pain it has caused. My neck, back, shoulders, and esp. the pectoral area are tight, and I cannot ever get comfortable and forget about these damn implants. Because of my lymphedema, I will be removing the implants without replacing. It's really the best thing for my health, so it's kind of a no brainer. I did do some research, but it confirmed that those who develop CC are likely to get it again with new implants. And with the lymphedema, I'm just not willing to involve any other body parts since I need to keep all the healthy nodes I can! I really don't care enough about having breasts to cut other parts of my body, which I happen to think is just fine the way it is. Right now I'm researching who I want to do my surgery and hope to make that decision some time in January. February is my goal for surgery. I cannot wait to get rid of these things and hope to finally have the mental energy to move on and think about something else!!! I feel like I've been held hostage by these implants for over two years. I am so done. It's not to say I didn't go through a little grieving process - I had a meltdown for a couple weeks once I realized what I needed to do. Sort of took me back to when I first had my BC diagnosis. But I feel good about my decision and can't wait to be done, just like you. I'm also curious to know what you look like now. If you had implants, is your muscle stretched? Did they remove the extra skin? I'll admit I'm a little worried about what I will look like - just want to be as neat and tidy and flat as possible. If you don't mind, I would really like to hear about it.",

For me, the recon was like a safety net, and having my implants removed felt like I was revisiting the mastectomy. My surgeon warned me I might go through an emotional period and to let myself have that time to mourn. It's normal to want to look as good as possible and to worry about the unknown. Boobsinabox, I am now six weeks post deconstruction surgery and getting used to my new look. With my lymphedema, it's doubtful I'll be able to wear a bra, since I couldn't with my implants. The side bands pressed on the wrong areas under my arm or around back, even the highest cut ones. Maybe without the implants I'll have more options - they made me wider than I had been prior to BC and even clothing no longer fit me well. Now my body feels more like it did pre-BC and clothes fit me better being flat than with implants! That makes me really happy. I've decided that if by some chance I am able to wear a bra, I'm going to go with a small prosthetic, just something to fill out any concave areas and smooth out the lumps. So, my plan is to go form-free the majority of the time, with the option to wear the same clothes with a prosthetic. I still have five more months to go to see how the stretched muscle and skin will shrink and retract. I have already noticed small changes. So, I've started shopping for clothes and trying on a variety of things, even stuff I'd never consider before. I've had some success and I'm feeling pretty good. The other day I finally went through all the dresses and tops in my closet and tried everything on. I ended up being able to keep about four dresses, two of which I had purchased for a wedding I attended not long after my BM. All the dresses with darts looked awful, just as you said. I have a collection of dresses, some of which are vintage and have been with me for quite a while. Fortunately, my favorite vintage dress miraculously still looks great - hadn't been able to wear with implants, so a nice bonus - but everything else has to go. I had a mini-meltdown at the point when I recognized this, as these things are associated with great memories and my sense of body image pre BC. So, I just had that moment and then pulled myself together and promised myself I would find new clothes that I will feel good wearing now. It's definitely a time of adjustment, but I think I'm handling things well and feeling positive the majority of the time. Being released from the intense pain that I lived with for over two years is such a relief, it's hard to be too upset or focused on the appearance of my chest. It has brought me full circle to the time after my BM when I was grateful to be cancer free and healthy, and that is a good place to be.",

I also know for sure that at the time of my deconstruction, my latest PS didn't do any lipo upon removing the implants. I have truncal lymphedema and the priority was minimal disruption of the chest area.  Maybe it's related to one's original breast size, weight, and body structure. Some women have larger or more pronounced ribcages, too, and we all hold fat in different places. Anyway, it sure is interesting how we all come out looking different with the same procedure!!   However, as I mentioned, I just deconstructed, and that can leave things looking quite a bit different than if there has been no screwing around with the muscle.",

PS's do things differently, so it's hard for me to give advice because I worry I will give you the wrong info. Please ask your PS or his nurse. Don't be afraid to call his office - I'm sure he wants you to have the best outcome and will welcome any questions. As far as the swelling, I would avoid using extremes of temperatures. I hope this is just post-surgical swelling, but if it persists or you are concerned, check out the lymphedema forum. Those chicks know their stuff. I have lymphedema in my trunk, actually the side of my chest below my armpit. I had it before I had my implants removed, and the surgery did cause it to flare. I am still working on getting it to go down. Sometimes bra bands (even sports bras) can restrict lymphatic flow down the chest/trunk, and a compression tank or tee can be helpful. Many bra companies make shapewear garments that work very well. Maidenform makes a Control-It tank, and also a line called Flexees. I wore these after my mastectomy before I had any fills, and it felt good to have something on my chest. Now I have to wear a compression tank to keep the swelling down. Oh, and a good thing about these shapewear garments is that you can step into them vs putting on over your head.",

Once the drains were removed, I felt much better, but I was still a little sore from the pocket work. I did end up feeling pretty good before the expansions started, no feeling of a tight band. I had a very painful expansion, and after the exchange surgery I had that tight band feeling. Not until I had my reconstruction undone (implants and capsules removed and muscle tacked back to the chest wall) in April this year, did I get relief from the tight band feeling. Even much of the numbness on the sides of the chest went away. I know this kind of thing varies from person to person, but I went from having chronic pain for two years to 99% pain free. My body did not like the expanders or implants from day one. I still wish I had never opted for the surgery, but I made a decision I thought was right at the time. It would have been a good choice if I had listened to my body and stopped the expansion when it was so painful. Good for you for listening to your body and doing what you feel is right for you. I wish you the best with your treatments. jblcsw - I'm sorry you had such problems trying to reconstruct. It really is a tough road, and it's hard to know when to call it a day. I'm glad you feel at peace with your decision. Once I decided to deconstruct, it was such a relief. It takes such mental and emotional energy to keep in that fighting mode to make things work. At least after the 2nd expander is removed, you won't have to face any further surgeries, and you can take that fighting energy and put it toward moving on with your life. Good luck with your next surgery, and I hope all heals well and you can be on your way!",

Hope it's just another adjustment. From what I have read, the one step recon uses a \"sling\" to hold the implant. The sling is usually created using some form of dermal matrix, such as alloderm. This helps avoid the expansion phase, but I believe that smaller implants are used with this process. Each type of implant recon has its own issues, pros and cons.",

Likewise, the extra tubing can be hidden under a flowy skirt with an elastic band. As long as the waistband or fabric below doesn't cut off the flow/suction of the drains, you should be fine.

If you can walk around the block or just up and down your street a few times a day, you will probably feel much better.

I think you are now four or five days post surgery? The first week is definitely the hardest, and you should be feeling much better soon.",

I hope you don't have LE, but if you do, the best results for controlling are when it's addressed early. Don't let anyone minimize a small amount of swelling, either. The goal is to prevent further swelling and not have to wait until the condition is extreme to get proper care.

Glad he doesn't think it's LE, but I would definitely keep an eye on it if the swelling doesn't go down. Oh, and about getting LE? You do not need to have radiation to get it. In fact, you don't even have to have any nodes taken to get it. I had one sentinel node taken on my \"bad\" LE side and no nodes taken on my \"good\" LE side (as if there's anything such as \"good\" LE!). No radiation or chemo. There are several women on the LE forum that developed LE without any nodes taken or radiation. Not questioning your PS, but just know that most doctors and surgeons know very little about LE since they only receive 15 min - 2 hrs education on the lymphatic system in medical school. I certainly hope you don't have LE, though. Just urging you to be attentive. :-) I am glad you have felt well since your decon and were up for kayaking! So good to hear. Hugs, Tina",

First, the patient thinks they are working with a knowledgeable therapist and will be less likely to question exercises/instructions. Second, the therapist thinks they know what they are doing. My first therapist had me doing pushups not long after surgery, and she had me continue with them and other equally bad exercises even after she diagnosed me with truncal LE. Exercise was her method of therapy for LE and she didn't do any manual lymphatic drainage. Manual lymphatic drainage is definitely part of the intensive phase to reduce swelling, along with wrapping and other forms of compression. Your therapist should teach you how to perform on yourself so that after treatment ends it is one of the skills you have in your toolbox to manage swelling. mamabee - If I could go back in time, I would get measurements of both arms taken by a qualified LE therapist prior to surgery. This way you have good baseline measurements, and if you develop any unusual sensations in your arms you can stay on top of the LE while it is still in the pre-clinical stage. It can be reversible or much more easily managed when addressed earlier.",

I asked her to tell me about the abdominal work and after she explained, she made a photocopy of a page from the Zuther book so I could refer. There's actually a sequence of nine breaths and the hands are placed in the approximate locations for each breath : 1) belly button, 2) 2:00, 3) 4:00, 4) 2:00, 5) belly button, 6) 10:00, 7) 8:00, 8) 10:00, 9) belly button. The clock reference is mine and not exact, perhaps should be more on the half hour mid-point, but I think that gives you an idea.

He used this argument in my case regarding a request for a night vest and won my second level appeal. He said the night vest was a prosthetic device that compensated for my compromised lymphatic system. I was case #30 in his win column, back in January of this year. To quote from Bob's notice to Binney, \"The coverage requirements described below are, in this layman's opinion, derived from coverage criteria applicable to items used in the treatment of open wounds, and are not applicable to members of other benefit categories like durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics or prosthetic devices, all of which have their individual coverage criteria unique to their medical use or function. It is therefore erroneous to deny coverage to an item before determining in which benefit category it may belong based on its medical function. And yet this is exactly what is done when a lymphedema compression bandage system, a lymphedema compression garment or a lymphedema device is denied because it does not meet the coverage criteria required for a surgical dressing.\" I believe the point he is making is that Medicare has various benefit categories - such as wound care, DME, and prosthetic devices - each with their own criteria for coverage. Medicare has been denying LE garments because they don't meet the criteria for wound care, which is a category that covers dressings for open wounds. This is not the purpose of LE garments. Bob's argument is LE garments fall under the category of a prosthetic or prosthethic device and DO meet the criteria for coverage when submitted as such. The issue is that Medicare routinely denies coverage for a submission because it places it under the wrong benefit category of wound care. Bob's approach is to make sure reimbursements are submitted under the correct benefit category related to prosthetics or prosthetic devices. Bob is not a politician, rather an advocate who tirelessly wades through piles of health coverage regulations, insurance policies, and Medicare coverage, all in the hope of getting better care for lymphedema patients. I am no dummy, but I got the runaround from my insurance co regarding coverage until I was ready to poke my eyes out. Bob handled my appeal, and he examined my policy and pulled together an appeal submission that would make anyone's head spin. His presentation to the appeals committee via phone conference was equally amazing. This man is bright, dedicated, and compassionate and cares about getting coverage for patients.",

He and his wife kind of laughed, as I guess they just couldn't imagine what it would be like. I squashed the laughing immediately and said it wasn't funny at all and that there wouldn't be holes, rather the muscle and skin would still be there. My husband was present, and when I asked him later if he had heard what they said and the laughing, he said he had. He said I handled it well and that he hadn't wanted to get anywhere near that conversation! He said they were wrong to say that and laugh, but we both acknowledged they truly didn't understand anything about reconstruction, implants, or deconstruction. People that love us don't have the immediate education on all things BC, treatments, surgeries and recon that we do, but they try to support us. They can't help but stick their foot in their mouths every now and then.

What is the difference between the collagen related to scar tissue that myofascial release helps resolve and the kind caused by LE? It's my understanding that fibrosis is the ultimate enemy for those with LE and the best reason for regular MLD and wearing compression garments as directed. My therapist has said I have minimal swelling and pretty much within the normal range. I now can \"test\" what I can get away with. I watched the JoAnn Rovig DVD again, which is what got me to thinking about fibrosis since I used to regularly go for myofascial release for scar tissue around my chest/ implants. At that time I only had truncal LE, but the swelling often went down after a session. I have gone few times since my last surgery - to help my back adjust to removal of implants, and to make sure my incision scars and chest skin and muscle didn't have any adhesions. He was careful about my LE even though he worked within that quadrant. I can't help wonder if it's likely I'll develop fibrosis in my trunk or of I already have it. I have always been careful about pressing too deeply in my LE areas, but I question if I should be looking for fibrotic areas in my trunk so I could break that down. The myofascial release may have helped me stay on top of this. Is it possible to develop arm LE because the trunk has a lot of scarring? The Rovig DVD uses a different technique for MLD than what I have been taught. It seems to take half the time. It is also slightly different as far as pathway for drainage as I have been shown. It looks easier to do the arm, which I find cumbersome. Does doing two different techniques create a problem? \"Life isn't about finding yourself, life is about creating yourself.\" ~ George Bernard Shaw Dx 11/13/2007, DCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Makes me rethink about trying. Kira, I'm curious, but where does neurontin fall in the category of drugs?  Suzy, I can relate to your LE emotional timeline. I was fried from two months of expander pain during the summer of 2008, so I do think that sapped a lot of the original positive attitude I had about surviving BC. The permanent implants in Sept. felt much better, however, that reprieve was short-lived. I had a full-blown LE flare in April of 2009, floundered until I found info here about finding a good LE therapist. Anyway, from early June through September I went to the LE therapist until it was under control. I was cut loose and on my own doing MLD, trying to come to terms with the whole permanence of LE. My implant was warping and also causing pain. Even though I had started treatment for the scar tissue, the relief it provided just didn't come soon enough. I could feel myself mentally \"going down\" because of the daily pain. Finally, in October, I called my primary and asked for an antidepressant. I didn't want to do it, and I didn't even think it would help with the pain, I just wanted help with my ability to deal with it. Lo and behold, along with an improvement in my attitude and mood, my pain lessened as well. And, I think feeling better allowed me to do more and be more active than I had been in a while. Increased motivation gave me back a sense of hopefulness - I still feel LE sucks, but I can function more fully. So, I really don't think anyone who has LE or a chronic issue with pain should have to feel bad about needing medication. We know studies have shown that chronic pain can lead to depression. Oh, and I also take a valium in the evening and occasionally will take an ambien if I haven't been sleeping well because I'm too wired about something and need to catch up. That's just the way it is now. Tina ",

I was asked to take a deep breath in, then breathe out slowly through my mouth and whoosk! they were gone. I could feel a slight pulling, but no sensation. One side was 12\" and the other 10\". What a relief!!",

Notice the article was written by someone with LE credentials. I am not sure where the author gets the 70% figure (FDA?) and whether the statistic combines both augmentation and reconstruction patients. My other complaint is the use of a pump is included as one of the methods of LE management without indicating it should be used as a last resort. Still, it seems like a well balanced and very informative piece on the risk and issues of LE for those considering breast augmentation or breast reconstruction.

Post surgery, she had me taking them at the midpoint between antibiotic doses. I was to continue with doses for a couple of weeks after the round of antibiotics was complete. She had me taking iFlora (professional use line), and I still purchase from her office. It is a broad spectrum probiotic with a variety of strains of good bacteria, has a coating that delays release of bacteria to when it reaches intestines, and is shelf stable. I still take one or two daily, as it really helps with regularity and g - a - s . . . . plus I have some food allergies which it seems to tame somewhat.",

I'd consider protection and prevention, as well as addressing any swelling or early LE symptoms a cornerstone of post-BC self care.  ",

Binney, I know the funding isn't there for specific studies about recon and LE, but I couldn't help but think that while ALFP has been so carefully rooting through previous studies that it's too bad to not have included any info about recon if it was mentioned. Going forward, any study that is reviewed or funded could identify whether a patient had already opted for recon and what type. And for the length of time of the study, if a patient undergoes recon, it could be noted. I guess I think any info should be gathered about recon when possible. It's a lot easier to determine whether a patient has had recon (yes, no, what kind) than it will be for all these LE professionals and DME folks to agree on standardized ways to measure LE across studies, as well as establish good practices of care.",
