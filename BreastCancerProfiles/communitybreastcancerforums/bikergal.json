Can your wife hang on until summer vacation, or go out on short term leave, so as to get paid during the summer months? Good luck! BG    ",

Many women in my support group see Dr. Smith, and they all love him.  He is from all accounts very compassionate and caring.  However, I personally have not been impressed by some of his treatment recommendations (for others), which did not seem consistent with evidence-based medicine.  Second opinions also have disagreed with his recommendations.  If you have other choices with respect to doctors that will administer intreathecal Herceptin, I would choose someone else, if you can get into see that person in a timely maner.  You should know that Dr. Slamon, who was the force behind Herceptin is at UCLA.  Although it is almost impossible to see him, his protegee, Dr. Hurvitz (spelling?) is more available.  The medical oncologists at UCSF, where I am treated, are excellent.  Getting in to see them, however, may be difficult.   ",

It can be extremely frustrating.  I think UCSF needs to be made aware of what is going on.  That said, I think you are in very good hands.  She is extremely smart and knowledgeable.     ",

Now I am just on Herceptin, so there is no excuse not to exercise.  I hope to hike up a 14,000 foot peak in a couple of weeks.  (Although I have not had much time to recover from my mastectomy.)    As for the gym, I am terrible about going, since I don't enjoy working out at a gym.  But it sounds like you enjoy it.   And this isn't trivial.  I know that once my nurse practitioner asked me if I had been riding or running recently, and I said \"no.\"  She looked very concerned, until I explained that it had rained the last few weekends in a row.  But she knows that exercise is important to me, and really encourages it.   I have been very fortunate to be NED for the last three years.  But I think it is important to try to limit what cancer takes from you.  And if going to the gym is something you enjoy, you should make up your mind that you will keep going, even if it ends up that you have to reduce your workout somewhat.  ",
