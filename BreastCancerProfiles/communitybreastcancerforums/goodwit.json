I stayed in the hospital one night and then was discharged the next morning. The BS originally offered the mastectomy as an out patient surgery but I opted to stay the night. After 20 years, I was recently diagnosed with a IDC in my remaining breast and will have a mastectomy on July 31. As I remember it the surgery was not really that bad, that's a clinical term for lay people. If you can I would prep some meals ahead of time, or have lots of frozen dinners that can be microwaved; laundry I think will be questionable for the 2 weeks. 20 years has erased a lot of the memory of the original mastectomy. The 6 months of chemo, and the tissue expander surgery and inflation when I decided 5 years later to get reconstruction are much more vivid in my memory for the pain and impact on daily living. Best of luck, I am hoping your brothers will come through as needed once the time comes,",

I was working part time and continued working through the chemo. I also showed horses, with a lot of help from friends while on chemo. I worked MTW, stopped on my way home from work on Wednesday for infusion then rested through the weekend unless I went to a horse show. I did have bloodwork before the two week treatment and when my white cell count was too low I did end up having to give myself neupogen shots. I am distressed that I ended up with another round of BC in the remaining breast but this one is ER/PR+ the first was not. Scheduled for a mastectomy on the 31 and hoping my oncotype is low enough that I don't have to do chemo, but if I do, I will do it again gladly since I credit CMF for 20 cancer free years. Best wishes to all of you during your treatment.",

My first round was 20 years ago and I have very little info about the type of tumor. I only know it was ER-. After the 1998 mastectomy, I had 6 months of CMF chemo, with two weeks on and two weeks off. I continued to work part time and even showed horses through the chemo. I did sleep more than usual, was never nauseous, and for the last 2 months had to give myself neupogen? injections due to chronically low white cell counts. I thought my 20 years meant I was home free, but surprise, here I go again. This time have much more info about tumor and am 67 instead of 48, following a mastectomy of my remaining breast I only am taking anastrozole with no side effects so far. Only posting to encourage those taking CMF, it worked for me!",
