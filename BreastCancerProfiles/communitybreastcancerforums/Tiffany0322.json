I'd also like to note that I have some significant family history of reproductive disease/cancer diagnosis./ I'm a 34yr old mom, and a few years ago I found a lump in my left breast. It was small, hard and painful when I examined to find it, and occasionally in relation to my cycle. I saw a GP for a basic exam by hand and was told it's not cancer, nothing to worry about. (No actual testing done, just the touch exam). Fast forward to now, several years later and the same lump is still present, although now I'm experiencing sore/tenderness without provocation and have noticed a pronounced spot of dimpling when I lift my arm. I will be scheduling an appt tomorrow hopefully, to have this looked at by a professional. I'm just wondering if anyone here has had similar symptoms? Thanks in advance!! Log in to post a reply",
