      "Content": "Hi, My name is Dave, will be 62 next month. Sept. 10 went to my primary Dr. for annual check up. Also, told me about a prostate test. I said yes as I don't think I've ever had one (my wife said I had one several years ago). The Dr. office call me the next day, PSA was 126. They had already made me an appointment for the next day (Wed., Sept 12th) to see an Urologist. 9-12-2012; While at the urologist office, they drew blood, Dr. did the prostate DRE test. He said my prostate was enlarged 4X the normal size. While in the office, he scheduled me for a biopsy for the following Wed. 9-19-2012. He called me the next day (Thursday, 9-13-2012) told me my psa level was now up to 128. Next Wed. (10-03-2012), I go see him for the lab results. I'm a very patient person and my wife and I have been through a lot in our 42 years of marriage (All we can say is: God has been so good to us). The pass few weeks, been having sore lower back, right hip\\butt\\upper leg and ribs have been sore at times. Getting up at least once a night, frequent need to urinate and at times, painful or burning sensation during urination. I've been on this site the past couple days and really like it. So tired of the wait. Any information or advice would sure be helpful. Thanks, Dave",

They had already made me an appointment for the next day (Wed., Sept 12th) to see an Urologist. 9-12-2012; While at the urologist office, they drew blood, Dr. did the prostate DRE test. He said my prostate was enlarged 4X the normal size. While in the office, he scheduled me for a biopsy for the following Wed. 9-19-2012. He called me the next day (Thursday, 9-13-2012) told me my psa level was now up to 128. Next Wed. (10-03-2012), I go see him for the lab results. I'm a very patient person and my wife and I have been through a lot in our 42 years of marriage (All we can say is: God has been so good to us). The pass few weeks, been having sore lower back, right hip\\butt\\upper leg and ribs have been sore at times. Getting up at least once a night, frequent need to urinate and at times, painful or burning sensation during urination. I've been on this site the past couple days and really like it. So tired of the wait. Any information or advice would sure be helpful. Thanks, Dave",

      "Content": "Hi, My name is Dave, will be 62 next month. Sept. 10 went to my primary Dr. for annual check up. Also, told me about a prostate test. I said yes as I don't think I've ever had one (my wife said I had one several years ago). The Dr. office call me the next day, PSA was 126. They had already made me an appointment for the next day (Wed., Sept 12th) to see an Urologist. 9-12-2012; While at the urologist office, they drew blood, Dr. did the prostate DRE test. He said my prostate was enlarged 4X the normal size. While in the office, he scheduled me for a biopsy for the following Wed. 9-19-2012. He called me the next day (Thursday, 9-13-2012) told me my psa level was now up to 128. Next Wed. (10-03-2012), I go see him for the lab results. I'm a very patient person and my wife and I have been through a lot in our 42 years of marriage (All we can say is: God has been so good to us). The pass few weeks, been having sore lower back, right hip\\butt\\upper leg and ribs have been sore at times. Getting up at least once a night, frequent need to urinate and at times, painful or burning sensation during urination. I've been on this site the past couple days and really like it. So tired of the wait. Any information or advice would sure be helpful. Thanks, Dave",

      "Content": "Hello Lee, So sorry you have to be here, but you're among great knowledgeable friends! I see you're in the Memphis area! My wife and I have lived in the Bartlett area since 1982 (love Bartlett)! Since your status has changed, it's a good idea that your seeing a medical oncologists. Starting out, I was sent to a urologists from my primary doctor (PD) in Sept. of 2012. Jan. of 2014, I switch to my current medical oncologist at West Cancer Clinic (Dr. Sylvia Richey). October 1, 2012, I was diagnosis with Advance Prostate Cancer (Adenocarcinoma) high volume, very VERY aggressive metastatic (in my bones), Stage 4! My PSA was 130 and Gleason score 9. Numerous skull lesion most prominently on my right occipital lobe (skull); cervical spine particularly and thoracic spine, multiple ribs; fourth vertebral and my T12 vertebral was eaten up with cancer and I had to have 10 rounds of radiation and surgery (11-6-2012) to rebuild my T12 vertebral. My urologist told me that I had four to five years at best! 10-1-12, I started hormone therapy: I started Bicalutamide (Casodex) 50 mg daily and on 10-3-12, had my first monthly injection of Firmagon and Xgeva. Per my urologist, first told me the first line of defense of hormone therapy would only last 6-18 months before having to go to something stronger! MY WIFE, FAMILY AND I, WERE DEVASTATED to say the least!! As of today, I\u2019m still on my first line of defense and my PSA is <0.064!! Having several bulged disc, my pain doctor has found the right combination of medicine to allow the pain in my lower back, right hip/butt to be manageable! During my journey with PCa, I've put my faith in God, a positive attitude, my doctors and medicine. Maybe we can meet soon! I'll keep you and your family in my thoughts and prayers!
