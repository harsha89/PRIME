It is very stressful. But looking at the numbers of your husband, I would say the bone scan and CT scan are very necessary. If I were in those same shoes and my numbers were like that I would have no choice but to go thru with those additional tests just so you can be very sure it hasn't spread. I don't know how long you have been married or your ages, but I was 49 when diagnosed last year and will be married 30 years this June. I didn't want to get surgery and though about the seeds. But my wife wanted me here with her and I wanted to be here and if the seeds didn't work, then no surgery could be performed. So I had my surgery last February and I have had a few PSA tests since and it was undetectable. My numbers were not as bad as your husbands but it was to a point where we didn't want it spread. The doctor also played a part in my decision and what made me prolong mine was the two previous doctors that I didn't want to perform surgery on me. They seemed too impatient and this was a big decision. By all means get those tests done. I pray that everything goes well. You can see my numbers on my profile.",

      "Content": "Hi, I am very sorry to hear of the diagnosis. I had been dealing with that since I was diagnosed in 2015 but had been trying to prolong it by doing various things. It is very stressful. But looking at the numbers of your husband, I would say the bone scan and CT scan are very necessary. If I were in those same shoes and my numbers were like that I would have no choice but to go thru with those additional tests just so you can be very sure it hasn't spread. I don't know how long you have been married or your ages, but I was 49 when diagnosed last year and will be married 30 years this June. I didn't want to get surgery and though about the seeds. But my wife wanted me here with her and I wanted to be here and if the seeds didn't work, then no surgery could be performed. So I had my surgery last February and I have had a few PSA tests since and it was undetectable. My numbers were not as bad as your husbands but it was to a point where we didn't want it spread. The doctor also played a part in my decision and what made me prolong mine was the two previous doctors that I didn't want to perform surgery on me. They seemed too impatient and this was a big decision. By all means get those tests done. I pray that everything goes well. You can see my numbers on my profile.",
