      "Content": "To answer a couple questions, I have remained in touch with especially my urologist, Misop Han, at Brady Clinic, Johns Hopkins. His advice in Dec 14 when PSA went to 0.3 was to get another reading in a month. When that was 0.2 his advice was to keep watching and said that there can be variation in PSA. This view was coroberated by my radiation oncologist. Also, the medical oncologist had advised in July of 2014 to keep watching and decide when you want to start hormone therapy. He advised that the statistics indicate a perhaps 6 month addition to life expectancy, but that my LE given where I was following the Salvage Radiation was likely in the 10+ year range so waiting to start would not have serious effect. He suggested deciding at what level PSA I wanted to start hormones and suggest 1.0 would be reasonable. All of this advice seemed consistent with possible post radiation bounce in PSA. The following 6 months at 0.2 seemed to confirm. When PSA reached 0.4 in Sept, it was clear further follow up would be needed, but also clear that another PSA would be needed and to wait for a confirming reading. Unfortunately the confirming reading in double. I expect to have a phone call with Dr Han not later than 12/9/15 and have an office appointment with the medical oncologist on 12/10. I have seen some reports of research indicating that combining hormones with chemo can be effective for rapidly doubling PSA. Any thoughts? OldCH4",
