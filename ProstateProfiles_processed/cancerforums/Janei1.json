My question is he has developed what we believe to be a Hernia where the laparoscopic hole is where the take out the prostate. We see our surgeon in two we but have been told to see a general surgeon. Can these hernias be repaired laparoscopically or do they do an open surgery. Does anyone know the medical term for this particular hernia. Thank.",

He had Davinci, 1 night in the hospital. 1 week with catheter and drain. Almost continent except for dribbles when straining. His pathology came back lower than original numbers. I do agree with the other post about your surgeon being very experienced. Our surgeon had done around 1200 so we were very comfortable . The thing we liked about the surgery for us was we felt we had a more accurate diagnoses and it was gone. Good luck. My friend.",
