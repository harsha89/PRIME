However, after reading and researching so many aspects of this disease, I am getting less optimistic. Initially, I thought that my young age, suggeted gleason 6 report and low psa of 4.71 was a good sign. But after really reading up on things, my age, size of my prostate (20 grams), high core count (5 of 6 on right lobe), seem to be painting a different more bleak prognosis as it currently stands. The doctor never mentioned any of that. I have also found throughout my reafings that young men with large volume, despite lower initial grades do not fair as well as thought, due to increasing high accounts of non confinement. Thoughts?",

I am grateful because just last night my buddy and PC warrior has had a recurrence after 3 years and it's vicious. His PSA skyrocketed from 1.84 in late December to over 60 in April. He has had surgery, radiation and 18 months of HT. He is only 53.....He was told he had Gleason 6, prior to surgery, and found put it was 10 afterwards. It had grown outside and into his seminal vesicles. Please pray for him as he is going back on HT and having at least one lymph node removed/radiated.",

All he could tell me about the diagnosis was that 4 of 10 cores were positive and it appeared contained. Anyhow, he had open RP, as robotic was not an option. Afterwards, he had a year and a half of undetectable readings. Then a rise started. 37 radiation treatments followed. Back to zero for another year and a half. Then the rise again started and has done so for the past 15 years! The weird part is that it goes up and down and up and down. It's been as high as 8.9 and back down to 5 and so on and so on. He has had no othet treatments in the 18 years since diagnosis and the Doc says that until it gets to 10, if ever, they aren't doing anything. Can anybody explain to me what the hell is going on with this situation lol? I couldn't hardly believe the story, and it makes no sense to me at all. Thanks!",

      "Content": "Sorry upfront gents, but I have yet to update my sig. Just to update some things, my cancer post pathology was all confirmed to be Gleason 6, however the biopsy did miss a tumor on the left side. With that said, the pathology also showed 2 small positive margins, Apex and Base and what was described as some microscopic cells at the bladder neck, which all sucks. However after a long talk with my surgeon, he explained that my prostate actually came out in two pieces (tore), and that he had to sew it all back together to give to pathology. The positive margins and bladder neck cells reported in his opinion were most likely just the result of the pathologist doing the best observation he could do with a distorted prostate, sewn back together and that the margins along with the bladder neck were never positive at all. He felt quite confident that he \"got it all\". I guess time will tell, as I have heard mention that Gleason 6 cells cant live outside the prostate, but I am really unsure that science can actually prove that hypothesis.",

      "Content": "Well, not to beat up on my Doc too bad, but he did tell me about two of the three margins and final Gleason score of 6. However, he did not mention that my prostate was actually torn bad, potentially causing the margins after it was sewed back together and given to the path lab. Also, while going over the report did not mention that the pathologist upgraded me to stage 3 because of the margin he told me about at the bladder neck. Again, something he was sure he may have caused, not on purpose with the removal. He said that he incinerated the entire area anyhow. He is a very accomplished surgeon that I researched heavily prior to letting him cut on me, and I told him that. In only a way that a confident surgeon could say it, he said his only concerns with my case was the final gleason score, and negative seminal vesicle, lymph vascular and lymph node invasion. He maintained that pathology reports are difficult to analyze, especially in my case, and are often misleading in regards to margins. He said the true tale of the tape that will never lie going forward is the PSA reading, which is undetectable and should remain that way. If it trends upward in the future, he said we would radiate the area and be done with it. He is a very optimistic and slightly arrogant guy. I kinda like that.",

Said my prostate came out in 2 pieces during surgery and that all of my margins are probably false, especially given my undetectable PSA prior to the 3 month standard. He is a super confident surgeon, but I did tell him two things : 1) He needs to explain shit better, especially to a COP. 2) I asked him if he knew the difference between God and surgeons? He said \"no\". I said God doesn't think he is a surgeon! Best wishes to all you guys on this forum, your support and encouragement has been so helpful. Godspeed!",

Although my Gleason grades are said to be 3+3's, I do have 5 cores positive on one side of my prostate, which clearly is alot.

Any ideas why that would not continue to occur once the tumors have effectively been removed, leaving behind only small amounts of cancer cells?",

      "Content": "Hello all, well I had an 8 week post surgery meeting and blood draw today. Wife and I met with surgeon and went over path report in detail etc. Well, all the cancer was in fact gleason 6, but was found on both sides, not just the right as the biopsy showed. Also, I thought the report was actually not as specific as some I have heard about. Anyhow, no lymph vascular invasion, no seminal vesicle invasion or lymph node invasion. However, small margins at apex, left base and bladder neck. Doc explained that the bladder neck and base were essentially the same and he felt the complete burning of that area destroyed anything there. As far as the other margin, he says during surgery those can appear positive but may not be. My path report shows me as a pt3a, which I didn't like.the sound of, but because of the microscopic bladder neck cells, it is what it is. He said there was bo extraprostatic extension however. My surgeon was quite honestly pretty excited about the outcome, me.....not sure yet. He was more excited about the gleason grade than anything. I said well thats great as long as we did get ALL of it and if not, it didn't decide to mutate into gleason 7,8,9 or 10 and metastasize. He also felt if we even had the future need, radiation would kill anything left behind. Hope he is right!",
