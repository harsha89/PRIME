    "Content": "Please recommend urologist you are satisfied for postatectomy. Does he also perform the MRI-guided biopsy? We will go anywhere in the United States for a good urologist (Anyone knows someone good in Cleveland? We have family near San Francisco. But any other place/urologist which you may recommend would be helpful) In our case it is almost certain it is cancer, but the biopsy is required to identify the specific cancer and for staging.",
