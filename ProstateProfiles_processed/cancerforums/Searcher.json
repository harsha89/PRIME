I am so thankful that because I have a low grade, enclosed in the prostate, etc. ... that all treatment options are open, but deciding on what is best for me is exhausting. The bottom line is that I want to LIVE, but I would like to not deal with incontinence or significant ED. Hope some of you can help with your experiences and input. I take Viagra now in order to get Super Hard, but the little fellow does OK without on some days. Does this impact my odds of having ED after treatment? I am torn between Brachytherapy and having the Surgery. I am willing to do whatever is necessary to live!!! But it appears that Brachytherapy as a stand alone treatment would have the least side effects, do the least damage, be less painful, less down time, increased odd of not having ED, increased odds of not being incontinent long term. Again, I welcome any and all experiences and input! THANKS GUYS!",
