    "Content": "My Husband has recently been diagnosed with Prostate cancer, his PSA level was 116, Gleeson score is 9, what I don\u0092t understand from reading various articles is the other stage the doctor has wrote down T3b N1 M1. The cancer has spread to his lymph nodes in the pelvic area and his hip and pelvis but nowhere else, can it be T3 when the bones and lymph nodes are affected? He is on Hormone therapy only at the moment, he is 57 years old. Any advice would be welcome . Thank you",
