A little more history about myself is my father and uncle have both had PC and had theirs removed about 20 years ago. I've worked at a chemical plant for almost 30 years and we get a physical once a year and blood work twice a year my PSA looks like this over the last 10 years 07-.8 08-.9 09-1.1 10-1.3 11-1.0 12-1.2 13-1.4 14-1.7 15-1.7 16-2.1 I had just had my yearly physical in Aug. and the plants doctor did not feel anything. I was having some discomfort in my scrotum and he suggested that I see my urologist. He did a DRE also and found the nodule. Still not sure what was causing the discomfort but it has pretty much went away for the most part. He also found blood in my urine which didn't surprise me because I have a past history of kidney stones and was thinking that might be what was causing the discomfort. He order a CT scan which came back neg. but did find some stones in both kidneys but nothing that should cause me any pain right now. Then me did the biopsy after that he scoped my bladder and said it looked fine. That's pretty much how I've got to this point. I appreciate any advice or guidance I can get.",

      "Content": "Thanks everybody for the Good advice. As you probably know it's kind of sets you back when hear the word \"CANCER\". I'm anxious to hear what my urologist has to say Thursday. A little more history about myself is my father and uncle have both had PC and had theirs removed about 20 years ago. I've worked at a chemical plant for almost 30 years and we get a physical once a year and blood work twice a year my PSA looks like this over the last 10 years 07-.8 08-.9 09-1.1 10-1.3 11-1.0 12-1.2 13-1.4 14-1.7 15-1.7 16-2.1 I had just had my yearly physical in Aug. and the plants doctor did not feel anything. I was having some discomfort in my scrotum and he suggested that I see my urologist. He did a DRE also and found the nodule. Still not sure what was causing the discomfort but it has pretty much went away for the most part. He also found blood in my urine which didn't surprise me because I have a past history of kidney stones and was thinking that might be what was causing the discomfort. He order a CT scan which came back neg. but did find some stones in both kidneys but nothing that should cause me any pain right now. Then me did the biopsy after that he scoped my bladder and said it looked fine. That's pretty much how I've got to this point. I appreciate any advice or guidance I can get.",
