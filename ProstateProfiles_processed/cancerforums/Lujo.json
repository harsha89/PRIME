      "Content": "Thank you to everyone for your kind replies and understanding. I was quite hesitant to post initially because my Dad has gone and I can see that wanting to know x, y and z about his treatment or medical history is academic and won't bring him back. However, I do feel like I want to know. My Dad was 76, nearly 77, so not young by any standard but before his symptoms was enjoying life. He wasn't the most active of men but he had started walking into town (a two mile round trip) about once a week and he had hobbies to fill his time. He should have had much longer to live. The post mortem was on Tuesday and we had a phone call from the coroners office Tuesday afternoon to tell us that the cause of death was metastatic carcinoma of the prostate. I haven't phoned up to ask for the full report. I will do that. As to the Gleason score I will check the report (once I have it) but I very much doubt they will have reported that. I believe that they only look for a cause of death. I don't think they would have taken any tissue samples to examine. They told me that when they do a post mortem once they find a cause of death they stop the post mortem. As to the examinations my Dad underwent for his prostate during his life. I believe he probably had a rectal exam and the PSA test. Certainly my Mum talks about the blood test. I don't think he had any biopsy. I think from the results of those two tests he was probably told it was benign, simply due to ageing. I think I'll apply to see his medical records. I'm not sure how to go about this. My Dad was quite a private man and he certainly didn't talk much about his prostate with me, spoke about it more with Mum. According to cancer research UK, the 5 year survival rates are 81.4%. For the US the 5 year survival rate is >99% (cancer.org) so there is a massive difference. It is very disheartening that whilst 81.4% of UK men survive at least 5 years my Dad died before he was even diagnosed.",

      "Content": "My Dad recently passed away after a short illness. His symptoms started just seven weeks before he died and he really went downhill in the last two weeks of his life. We had no idea he was so ill. By the time my Dad got a referral and eventual admittance to the hospital he was very poorly. He was transferred to ITU the same day he was admitted. His liver and kidneys had failed. He was awake and aware. They did a CT scan of his liver which showed it to be completely covered in tumours and he had no liver function. He was too ill to even do a biopsy. They told us and Dad that he could not be cured and Dad opted for palliative pain relief and sedation. They stopped his medication and unhooked him from the dialysis machine. We told him how much we loved him and held his hand whilst he slipped away. The doctors involved in his care told us that a post mortem would have to be carried out to establish the cause of his death. I was thinking it must have been one of the silent cancers e.g. liver cancer because Dad only became symptomatic just weeks before he died. However, we have been informed that Dad died from metastatic carcinoma of the prostate. This has come as a bit of a shock to me because although Dad has had prostate symptoms for years (frequency of urination) he had it checked out. I remember asking him years ago whether he had it checked out and he said yes and my Mum remembers that he had it checked out. After he had it checked out he just assumed that the frequency was due to ageing. He didn't have any further symptoms prostate or otherwise until the last few weeks of his life. My Mum told me when he got ill that he wanted to get his prostate checked out again because he was having some trouble passing urine. I have not read of anyone who died from prostate cancer prior to a diagnosis and as far as I know it had not spread to the bones which I thought was much more common than spread to the liver and gastrointestinal lymph nodes alone. I guess my questions to anyone who might know are: 1) Has anyone heard of someone dying from prostate cancer before being diagnosed? 2) After my Dad had his prostate checked out initially should he have gone back to have it re-checked? I don't believe he was told to come back and get it rechecked. There is no screening protocol in the UK. Thanks in advance (Just in case my signature confuses people I normally post in the lymphoma forum as I'm in remission from Hodgkin's lymphoma).",
