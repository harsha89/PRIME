      "Content": "Had my prostatectomy 5.4.18. Gleason 6 became Gleason 7 (3+4). All margins, nodes etc were negative. Had my psa 6 weeks after surgery result was <.03. The one resident on hospital said there may be some residual psa for 6 to 8 weeks then go to zero. surgeon expected a zero today. Is there normally a residual psa? should I be concerned about <.03? some websites considered this non-dectable others said it was detectable. I don't believe it was the ultra sensitive psa test. Any ideas appreciated. Thanks. As a footnote I was the person with the surgeon that suggested a partial prostatectomy since it was an anterior tumor. I had the complete prostatectomy not partial. Turns our there were 4 or 5 areas of cancer in my prostate. It comprised about 10% of prostate and grade 4 was 1 to 10%. glad I didn't get the partial. Makes me question the radiation seeds etc if you can have multiple areas that don't show up on an MRI. Treat one area and the rest grow. Thanks again",

Also, I know of several people that have been diagnosed with different types of cancer from prostate, throat lung etc. Really great people.

      "Content": "Is it right for me. Yes I think so. My concern is the possibility of permanent incontinence. Radiation carries the same risks. If my prostate was small,normal size, I would probalby go with radiation. My prostate being large causes some dribbling, stress incontinence etc now that has gotten worse as I age. I am hopeful that the surgery will remove the cancer but also some of the incontinence issues I have currently. Only scary part is if the incontinence becomes worse and stays that way. I don't think there are other options unless I am missing something.",

      "Content": "My prostate is large, about 100cc, and over the years has caused the normal incontinence issues. Dribbling after urination, stress incontinence, multiple trips to the bathroom at night etc. I am overweight also which I know does not help. After several years of going to a urologist who monitors his patient with a DRE and psa test. Psa had been rising and his response had always been \"you have a large prostate but there are no areas that are suspect\". Psa gradually increased to 8 or 9. He did a biopsy and found only some ASAP cells which he felt were nothing. Then Psa spike to 15 for unknown reason that forced him into order an MRI which showed a suspect area. Having my fill of this doctor I went to a highly rated large hospital and got a urology surgeon that specializes in robotic surgery. Seems very competent and expierenced. Did a psa there and it was 9.66. He did a mri fusion biopsy and took several cores from the tumor which is anterior rather than posterior(which is why the first doctor could not find it with a DRE). Gleason 6 although the cores were 70 to 80% cancer. But if you consider is was fusion guided and several cores were done there I feel pretty confident it is gleason 6. Tried AS for 6 months. Latest psa 11.5. Have at this point decided on surgery. They are doing a new type of surgery called a partial prostatectomy. Only used on those with anterior tumors. They remove the front of the prostate and recconect the bladder. Idea behind this surgery is he does not go any where near the nerves so there should not be any damage to them. Has anyone heard of this type of surgery good or bad? I am really tired of the current frequency and incontinence from the large prostate I am willing to try anything. I am hoping the surgery will help with the current incontinence. Opinions for or against. Do most people gain control after surgery after a period of time? Dont know whether to opt for traditional remove it all surgery or try this new type. Any help or comments appreciated.",

      "Content": "Is it right for me. Yes I think so. My concern is the possibility of permanent incontinence. Radiation carries the same risks. If my prostate was small,normal size, I would probalby go with radiation. My prostate being large causes some dribbling, stress incontinence etc now that has gotten worse as I age. I am hopeful that the surgery will remove the cancer but also some of the incontinence issues I have currently. Only scary part is if the incontinence becomes worse and stays that way. I don't think there are other options unless I am missing something.",

      "Content": "My prostate is large, about 100cc, and over the years has caused the normal incontinence issues. Dribbling after urination, stress incontinence, multiple trips to the bathroom at night etc. I am overweight also which I know does not help. After several years of going to a urologist who monitors his patient with a DRE and psa test. Psa had been rising and his response had always been \"you have a large prostate but there are no areas that are suspect\". Psa gradually increased to 8 or 9. He did a biopsy and found only some ASAP cells which he felt were nothing. Then Psa spike to 15 for unknown reason that forced him into order an MRI which showed a suspect area. Having my fill of this doctor I went to a highly rated large hospital and got a urology surgeon that specializes in robotic surgery. Seems very competent and expierenced. Did a psa there and it was 9.66. He did a mri fusion biopsy and took several cores from the tumor which is anterior rather than posterior(which is why the first doctor could not find it with a DRE). Gleason 6 although the cores were 70 to 80% cancer. But if you consider is was fusion guided and several cores were done there I feel pretty confident it is gleason 6. Tried AS for 6 months. Latest psa 11.5. Have at this point decided on surgery. They are doing a new type of surgery called a partial prostatectomy. Only used on those with anterior tumors. They remove the front of the prostate and recconect the bladder. Idea behind this surgery is he does not go any where near the nerves so there should not be any damage to them. Has anyone heard of this type of surgery good or bad? I am really tired of the current frequency and incontinence from the large prostate I am willing to try anything. I am hoping the surgery will help with the current incontinence. Opinions for or against. Do most people gain control after surgery after a period of time? Dont know whether to opt for traditional remove it all surgery or try this new type. Any help or comments appreciated.",

Do any of them take into account lab errors, calibration , dehydration etc into their statistical models? It seems like maybe they don't think they exist of perhaps they muddy the data and they are omitted? Or perhaps >0.03 is bad no matter what even if psa results goes down on the next test?",
