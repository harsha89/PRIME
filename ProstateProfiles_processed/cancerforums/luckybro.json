    "Content": "Every recovery is unique. There are those who have better recoveries than others. I an told that the best recovery starts with being in better shape. My Urologist recommended that I get fit and trim before the procedure, which I did. It has helped greatly. Its been 2 months since my op and feel great. The occasional dribble after 6 weeks has now become nothing. The Pelvic floor exercises are a great help. The doc gave me a script for the little blue pill, but this has not been required. I'm told that Pelvic Floor exercises are good for that as well. I was also a bit apprehensive about the Catheter removal, but it turned out I shouldn't have been. It is a painless procedure, but listen to what the medical specialist tells you to do. A long exhale works wonders! I had to stay for a while afterwards as they want you to pass urine a couple of times to make sure things are flowing. The first time I would recommend sitting down. Things have a tendency to not go where they are aimed the first time. Hindsight is 20/20 they tell me.....",
