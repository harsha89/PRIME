Having a big problem to gaining bladder control! He is saying that the doctor is saying that the cancer is rapidly spreading (how would the doctor know this?) he's had no further test etc I am questioning some things because unfortunately my dad is not hearing what is said such as my dad is telling everyone it has metastasized when I point blank asked the doctor if this is true he said no everything is clear! So I think my dad is so scarred he is embellishing what he is hearing or hearing something totally different then what is said! I can give other examples of this too He is also mentioning the doctor wants to do another surgery because he should have gained bladder control by now and he hasn't and he needs to start radiation ASAP and can't because of this, and the cancer is spreading as we speak! I guess what I am asking is I know his cancer Gleason 7 (4+3) is aggressive but it is spreading as we sit here??? And doesn't the PSA mean anything also positive surgical. Margins don't always mean it is spreading does it? Sorry this is a little jumbled junta little flustered right now any insight would be more than appreciated!!!",

      "Content": "They put him on hormone therapy after the undetectable PSA I had asked the doctor myself why radiation and hormone therapy and he said that is his practice just to make sure nothing spreads! He had contacted a doctor at Johns Hopkins a month or so ago about the incontience I forgot his name and he said nothing to worry about for at least 6-9 months but his doctor is saying his \"type\" of incontience is bad I think he is referring to him occasionally going through 6-8 diapers a day although that is not the norm! I am told and it is common knowledge in the area that his dr is extremely aggressive even his own partners state that. I told my dad that everything was a success and just get rid of the margins and he is good to go he said to me no I am still full of cancer and its spreading!!! I think he seriously may need to go eat a little therapy, because I think this threw him for a loop!!! Thanks so much once again for all the insight!!!",

All pathology came back negative no lymph node or other organ invasion but came back with positive surgical margins and T2C. Does this mean it metastasized? His first post op PSA came back less than 0.01. His doctor is not all the concerned , he will start radiation as soon as he gains control of his bladder, he has started hormone therapy though. My question is about whether it has metastasized or not and if that PSA post op means anything Thanks for any insight!",

      "Content": "***Updated*****in post #6 My dad was diagnosed last Monday with prostate cancer. He had a gleason of 7 and his psa was a 7.9. They did a cat scan/bone scan on Friday, they found some hot spots in his hip, groin. This is what is terrifying me. I can deal with the prostate cancer, but the spreading is what is freaking me out. For about 6 months or so he has been having bad back pain, he was diagnosed with degenerative (?) disc disorder. But now with the hot spots showing on the bone scan, I am worried that the cancer has spread to the bones. and he was originally misdiagnosed with the disc disorder. He has been going to acupuncture and that has been helping with the back pain. Is there any other reasons for a scan to show hot spots and what are the chances with a gleason and psa rating that he has that it spread? I have looked for statistics everywhere and cannot find them. Any insight would be more than greatly appreciated. We go Friday for the bone/cat scan results. Thanks!!!",
