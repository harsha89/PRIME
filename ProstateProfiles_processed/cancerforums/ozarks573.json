      "Content": "Received my second 45 gm (six month) Lupron injection today in hip. Side effects so far are similar to what others have experienced: hot flashes, low energy, weight gain, loss of libido, and brain fog. The brain fog thing bothers both me and my wife more than the other things. It remains to be seen if my A1C and lipids have changed since being on Lupron. I have a primary care physician appointment next month and will see how my regular blood work turns out. I'm diabetic, have high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. My oncologist suggested stopping the Lupron after the first six months, the urologist wants me to go at least 18 months and preferably 36 months. I kicked the can down the road today and went ahead with another injection.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by OneOfMany Dear ozarks573; We're all hoping you will have a tolerable course of treatment and a favorable long-term result. About a year and a half ago I picked a similar course of therapy as did you. I did so after spending quite a bit of time researching the outcomes on PubMed. I was offered robotic surgery, open surgery, EBRT or high-dose brachytherapy with EBRT boost. (I picked the last one but I don't think there's clear evidence that it's better, although it does involve fewer visits.) What I could find as far as randomized comparisons led me to believe the radiation modalities were equivalent to the surgical modalities in terms of mortality or recurrence probabilities and I preferred the side-effects profiles of the radiation choice. To the moderators that removed my earlier replies: can you tell me where they ended up? I cannot find them. I reached a similar conclusion regarding the 10 year outcomes of surgery versus EBRT with ADT. The reality of my situation is that I have poor health to begin with, so what the heck, lets go with the route that has the fewer potential side affects for my particular case.",

Let's see what the others have to say as I also wish you the very best! Chuck Thanks for the encouragement and questions. My uro only performs open surgery. With my additional health risks factors, he said that he would not perform open surgery as he felt that it would be very difficult to perform successfully. He said that he would refer me to surgeons who perform robotic surgery, but in his opinion, they would likely not perform surgery either. I had already researched this myself and was prepared for this direction, so I was not surprised. I have diabetes, sleep apnea, an enlarged heart, degenerative bone disease that has affected my joints and vertebrae, kidney cysts, atrophied pancreas, and am obese at 6'0\" and 325#. The uro said that he felt that it would be extremely difficult to ensure removal of all the cancer through surgery.",

In any case, you would still appear to have a curable case, so hang in there. I looked online and the \"focal increased uptake\" in the bone scan can be caused by other things, such as: infection, fractures or synovitis. Let's see what the others have to say as I also wish you the very best! Chuck Thanks for the encouragement and questions. My uro only performs open surgery. With my additional health risks factors, he said that he would not perform open surgery as he felt that it would be very difficult to perform successfully. He said that he would refer me to surgeons who perform robotic surgery, but in his opinion, they would likely not perform surgery either. I had already researched this myself and was prepared for this direction, so I was not surprised. I have diabetes, sleep apnea, an enlarged heart, degenerative bone disease that has affected my joints and vertebrae, kidney cysts, atrophied pancreas, and am obese at 6'0\" and 325#. The uro said that he felt that it would be extremely difficult to ensure removal of all the cancer through surgery.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by OneOfMany Dear ozarks573; We're all hoping you will have a tolerable course of treatment and a favorable long-term result. About a year and a half ago I picked a similar course of therapy as did you. I did so after spending quite a bit of time researching the outcomes on PubMed. I was offered robotic surgery, open surgery, EBRT or high-dose brachytherapy with EBRT boost. (I picked the last one but I don't think there's clear evidence that it's better, although it does involve fewer visits.) What I could find as far as randomized comparisons led me to believe the radiation modalities were equivalent to the surgical modalities in terms of mortality or recurrence probabilities and I preferred the side-effects profiles of the radiation choice. To the moderators that removed my earlier replies: can you tell me where they ended up? I cannot find them. I reached a similar conclusion regarding the 10 year outcomes of surgery versus EBRT with ADT. The reality of my situation is that I have poor health to begin with, so what the heck, lets go with the route that has the fewer potential side affects for my particular case.",

Absolutely, great question, and I fully understand the difficult process of deciding which way to go. I researched online, read books, and talked face-to-face with four persons I know what have had prostate cancer....Originally Posted by OldTiredSailor Guess I have to jump in here having just gone thru the agony of deciding surgery or radiation in August of this year. The FIRST question that came to mind when I read the OP was \"I wonder why he chose RT rather than RP?\" His choice was also my initial chose but not my final choice....",
