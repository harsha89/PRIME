      "Content": "I had rp in Jan 2013. Three month later psa was 0.60. I decided to participate in a 2 year trial, Casodex for four weeks then zoladex followed by RT with continuation of zoladex for two years. My question is, has anyone had this kind of reading so soon after post opp. And if so what was your treatment course. Iam thinking or wounding what if I only had RT how long would I have before recurrence. Verses having some quality life before starting zoladex is really interfering with quality of life especially work physically and cognativly. Feel free to jump in Thanks Pathology adenocarcinoma.

Just my own experance some how stepped on the hose with the other foot and out it came ,(SON OF A B%&$H) that hurt, fortunately it was about two days before I had to have it removed. I work at my local hospital so I quickly drove down and had one of the nurses I know put a new one back in. I must have lucked out big time because there was no bleeding and the new one slipped right in. Man was i freaking worried . But over all from day one it was like Highlander mentioned it was kind of handy I could drink all coffee I wanted and didn't have to worry about getting up to use the john. Oh one little thing put a small dab of ointment on the end where it enters penis just to avoid irritation, and also its a good idea to wash the tube from where it enters about sis inches down to avoid any possible infection every day once a day . Good luck and best wishes for a speedy recovery.",

Just my own experance some how stepped on the hose with the other foot and out it came ,(SON OF A B%&$H) that hurt, fortunately it was about two days before I had to have it removed. I work at my local hospital so I quickly drove down and had one of the nurses I know put a new one back in. I must have lucked out big time because there was no bleeding and the new one slipped right in. Man was i freaking worried . But over all from day one it was like Highlander mentioned it was kind of handy I could drink all coffee I wanted and didn't have to worry about getting up to use the john. Oh one little thing put a small dab of ointment on the end where it enters penis just to avoid irritation, and also its a good idea to wash the tube from where it enters about sis inches down to avoid any possible infection every day once a day . Good luck and best wishes for a speedy recovery.",

Oh, and memory loss. I often find myself staring at the taps in the kitchen and bathroom and not remembering which way to turn them for hot or cold water. I never was any good at remembering people's names and I suspect it won't be long before I forget my own. I put my wallet in a safe place and it took me three months to find it again. When I did find it, I had no recollection of putting it there in the first place; and it was empty. I just can't remember all the things I've forgotten, so I'd better stop now. Hey fishy nice to see your out trolling, how's the clean up going. Look if you forget your name you can be a whole new person every day. Yeah I just had my third zoladex happy shot this week yee haa can't imagine what comes next. Oh almost forgot sticky notes everywhere buy lots of em. Of all the things I have lost I miss my mind the most. Don't know wrote that but it perfect",

      "Content": "Just had my third zoladex shot today, must say its been an interesting ride so far. When I first started six months ago, about three weeks in to it the flashes started ,not to bad at first one here and there rather mild. Month two they began intensifying, internal thermostat definitely being messed with. I can picture this little gremlin having a good time flipping the switch up and down laughing himself silly as I spaz out. Month three he must of gotten bored and decided to set it on high , programed to come on every time I started to feel comfortable. Next that nasty little bugger started playing with my internal clock, setting it back four or five hours so I would go to sleep when I was supposed to wake up. Trying to out wit this little demon is becoming a real challenge. I thought I could out smart him by changing from day shift to evening. It seemed to work, we'll for a little while. Sneaky little shit counter acted by going out and finding the highest energy consuming appliances he could get his ugly hands on, and started running them twenty four seven. Clever little minion, generators maxing out, backup systems failing on a regular basis, constantly rebooting do to system wide crashes, memory banks degrading. Time to find an expert bio maintenance engineer. I know what the?*#+ is this, my brain does the strangest things. Anyway at present the latest problem I'm experiencing is the constant short term memory loss. My long term is what it has always been ,short. I have to laugh at my self quit often because of the inability to remember the what heck I was looking for. Example: yesterday I was changing the rotors on my truck realized I needed my torque wrench which was only twenty feet from from my truck, but by the time I got to my tool box, totally forgot what I was looking for. Trying to carry on a conversation is a very lengthy ordeal ,every time I go to say something its like theres a traffic jam between my brain and my mouth, totally forgot what I was going to say. While driving on my way to an appointment, i find myself going some where else because I just drift of into space. Man this HT thing really messes with you brain. Trying to remember people's names......well good luck on that one. Any one else care to share their experiences on HT, or am I just going nuts.",

Ok so for the the last year my PSA has been holding steady at 0.0 1 and the occasional <0.01 infact this was where it was on match 20th. I just got back a test I had done four days ago because I have a meeting with my oncologist on Fri. My T went down to 0.6 from 2.5 And my PSA doubled to 0.02 , iam hoping this a minor hicup or mabye a small flair as result of The RT .Needless to say my anxiety levels are having a good time right now. Speculation any one. Oh I am still on zoladex which why this un nerves me even more this can't be good.",

      "Content": "Back in July and Aug I did the 33 IGRT adjavent treatments. Initial SEs were proctitis diarrhea and rectal bleeding. All but resolved. Now four months later I'm experiencing this pain in my left hip that comes and goes.I say comes and goes because when i sit for a short time and goto stand up I get this searing hot pain the shoots down my leg into my knee and lower leg some times its so bad I loose my balance,and almost fall to the floor. The other problem I'm experiencing is this nasty itching and burning on my Perineum Please forgive spelling. And my scrotum feels likes a peace of raw meat. Lotion helps to calm it down but it is relentless. Every week it seems to get a little worse ,including the hip pain . Currently I taking zoladex and psa is 0.01 has been there since May when I started. No difference since RT. So does anyone have any words of wisdom to convey. Or similar SEs .it's a five hundred km trip one way if I want to see oncologist and it's not an easy drive this time of year, so I booked an appointment with urologist in Jan that's only a hundred klics. Also booked appt with GP for Money.Would like to have a good arsenal of questions to ask when see him. In turn he will forward concerns to onc. Thanks for your time",

      "Content": "It's been almost eight months since I started Zoladex, experiencing the usual SEs \u0085flashes joint pain,cognitive issues . It's the fatigue iam having that hardest part to deal With. Met with my GP to day my blood work is all good, I asked what if anything can help with the constant fatigue. He prescribed a script for modafinil. Here's a paragraph on it , from pubmed A pilot study evaluating the safety and efficacy of modafinal for cancer-related fatigue. BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common symptom that lowers the quality of life of patients with cancer, affecting between 60% and 90% of patients. Relatively few options are available for the treatment of this debilitating condition. Modafinal, a psychostimulant developed for the treatment of narcolepsy, has been used to treat fatigue in other diseases such as multiple sclerosis, but little data support its use in cancer patients. OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: The primary objective of this open-label pilot study was to evaluate the safety, and efficacy of modafinil in improving cancer-related fatigue (CRF) as measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). The effect of this agent on depression, quality of life, functional status, and cognitive function was also assessed. Modafinal was self-administered at a dose of 100 mg/d during weeks 1-2, and 200 mg during weeks 3-4. Assessments were performed at baseline, 2, and 4 weeks. RESULTS: BFI score was improved in 46% of patients at 2 weeks and 75% at 4 weeks (p = 0.025). Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores declined at 2 and 4 weeks (p < 0.001). Most scales for neurocognitive function were unchanged. Score for all Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-BR) subscales (measuring quality of life), except social/family well-being, were improved (p < 0.05) at 2 and 4 weeks. Significant changes in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status were noted, with 40% of patients improving at least one level. Modafinil was well-tolerated with only one patient discontinuing treatment due to drug-related toxicity. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study modafinil was well-tolerated and effective for fatigue in patients with cancer. Improvements were also seen in mood, quality of life, and functional status. Has anyone tried this and what your experience with it. I try to exercise but its a catch 22 feel to tired to start and feel more burnt when I stop. No matter how much I sleep, still feel wasted. Any other suggestions? Thanks",

I just took my first dose on the 23 WOW body felt lighter in the sense the fatigue lifted and my cognitive fog eased up. This lasted for a good twelve hours, it started working really quickly like with in an hour or two, I had this really intense burst of energy .It felt really great. Of course I have been accused at times of not thinking before I act and this was a perfect example ,I immediately went out side and shoveled the snow off my drive way which is a 100 ft long . That was a mistake, totally wasted my self mussel wise every mussel in my body felt like a limp noodle. But my mind still felt really alert. The next day I was still feeling the affects as far the wakefulness. . Because this is a stimulate I decided to check my blood pressure because with the zoladex my bp was.. Or is running on the high side 150/85 well I was shocked 200/101. As much as I was impressed with the way this drug made me feel I decided not to take it for a few days and see if my bp regulates its self back down. The recommend dose was 200mg. I think I will drop it down too a 100mg and see if works and give my body time to adjust to it. .. See how it goes Another thing I noticed after taking this my flashes intensified x2 hell I could probably lay naked in a snow bank an think I was in Hawaii )",

      "Content": "Hi everyone after viewing everyone's. Stories on here I decided to join the group. A little about my self regarding my PCa. Back in Jan 2009 I went for my first physical in years, all test came back good..? My Doc calls me in because my PSA was at 4 he said it's probably nothing but I would to book your to see a Urologist . A week later iam liying on a table with with the hacker from hell ,this man had no idea this was a person lying in front him. I my self had no real idea what a biopsy procedure was going to n tale. My urologist give a general idea, but he could have went a bit more detail. Whooooo big fellow what do you think you going to with that, he had in his hands this object the resembled a native war club, a 12'' handle with a large ball on the end ..At that point the thoughts going through I my head was where's the closes door. He even promptly assured me it was nothing to worry about. Riiiiiight. With no pre warning he shoves this foot ball...that's what felf like anyway. Up my but with no lube and instantly fires of this needle that felt it was going to come out my belly button ,whew ok that's done....what do mean there's 11 more When I complained about the new anus he just gave me he said nothing and kept on firiing away. Two days later while dealing with the new hemorrhoids I just acquired .my doc calls, says he wants to see me . You have Prostate cancer, your Gleason score is 3+3=6. Ok what's. A Gleason. After explaining ev erything to me he recommended I do bachial therapy. Ooook what's a brachial. He explained every thing to me and I actually understood what is was talking about. So after taking all this info I decided to go home and ponder my situation. According to dr. A Gleason 6 was very slow growing cancer. I had three months to think it over because my next appointment.to have my PSA checked is in March. In these months I read everything I could find on prostate cancer. Well that time of the month came up pretty quick. I decided I would do watch full waiting. For the first two years my PSA would jump back forth between 4 and5.?..I was siting in my Dr. Office reading a mag about prostate. Cancer when I came across an article. About New research regarding how Avodart was showing promise in in preventing cancer.,so I asked doc to write me a script so I could try it.Well dam after the first three months my PSA droped from 5 Down to 3.7 so we decided to continue with it longer next visit psa down to 3 wow this is to cool. I did this protocol for a year. Jan 2013 decided it was time to have another biopsy. Ohhhhhh Crap although my PSA was hovering around 3.5 my Gleason score came back at 4+4=8. One thing we noticed my prostate had shrunk to half its size. Avodart stops your body from producing the hormone DHT which is highly potent form of testosterone,it also helps in shrinking enlarged prostate. So our thinking was when I had my first biopsy it was larger so the needles didn't get an exact reading. So much for watchful waiting lets get this $?/+!(; out now. Jan 4 2013 had a RP done. Everything went smoothly spared vascular bundle. Catheter in for 10 days.minor incontinence for a week got better over time.Post surgical follow up psa. 60 not good.. For got to mention cancer had escaped the prostate, seminal vesicles involved. . Immediately started Casodex three weeks then Zoladex followed up with 33 RT. Is now Oct 12,2013. PSA 0.01 will continue on Zoladex for two years. Side effects of Zoladex. No libido, importance, fatigue, joint pain,muscle weakness,insomnia, confusion, head aches, HOT FLASHES!!!!! Side effects from RT proctitis, diarrhea, rectal bleeding fatigue. Did I say iam having fun yet oh yeaaa.",

For the first two years my PSA would jump back forth between 4 and5.?..I was siting in my Dr. Office reading a mag about prostate. Cancer when I came across an article. About New research regarding how Avodart was showing promise in in preventing cancer.,so I asked doc to write me a script so I could try it.Well dam after the first three months my PSA droped from 5 Down to 3.7 so we decided to continue with it longer next visit psa down to 3 wow this is to cool. I did this protocol for a year. Jan 2013 decided it was time to have another biopsy. Ohhhhhh Crap although my PSA was hovering around 3.5 my Gleason score came back at 4+4=8. One thing we noticed my prostate had shrunk to half its size. Avodart stops your body from producing the hormone DHT which is highly potent form of testosterone,it also helps in shrinking enlarged prostate. So our thinking was when I had my first biopsy it was larger so the needles didn't get an exact reading. So much for watchful waiting lets get this $?/+!(; out now. Jan 4 2013 had a RP done. Everything went smoothly spared vascular bundle. Catheter in for 10 days.minor incontinence for a week got better over time.Post surgical follow up psa. 60 not good.. For got to mention cancer had escaped the prostate, seminal vesicles involved. . Immediately started Casodex three weeks then Zoladex followed up with 33 RT. Is now Oct 12,2013. PSA 0.01 will continue on Zoladex for two years. Side effects of Zoladex. No libido, importance, fatigue, joint pain,muscle weakness,insomnia, confusion, head aches, HOT FLASHES!!!!! Side effects from RT proctitis, diarrhea, rectal bleeding fatigue. Did I say iam having fun yet oh yeaaa.",

Towards the end there a possibility of developing diarrhea some proctitis and rectal bleeding. Depending on his current health and physical health he should do just fine. Other SEs is fatigue but normally clears up in a few weeks to a month. G9 is not a good score hopfuly it was contained to the prostate. Pat report would give every one a better idea of his condition and better enable them to respond What are possible side effects? Ed, bladder urgency , Rectal incontinence, diarrhea, rectal bleeding Where could it have spread to? Lymphnodes, bones, can be controlled with Ht for x amount of time Will he be able to drive to treatments or will it tire him out? Yes depending on his current health. What is life expectancy post radiology? Sorry only God knows that answer Can he be around his grand children during 7 weeks of radiology? My RT onc. Told me yes as long as they don't sit on my lapp What did you find useful being done for you by your family? Normal rutune do not stress accept things for what they are and be informed. Statments above from my own experience, every one is different. Hope this helps. I'm sure others will chime in. Best wishes",

      "Content": "Hi Friendly Iam having the same type of problem, it started about two months after RT, it's gotten so bad I have have to be careful how I step because with out notice my leg will give out. Tought it might be bursitis at first but now i think it's related to possible nerve damage from the RT, can't be sure. Been on zoladex almost a year, it has really affected my arthritis . GP is at a lost, psa is 0.01 so I dout its cancer related .Tylanol and naproxen have been come part of my regular diet. Had BMD scan and xrays aside from Arthritis everything looks ok. I don't see my oncologist until late may. Would like to know what's going on. If your RO comes up with anything i would like to hear it. Is your pain getting worse over time, with me every month it gets a little more difficult. Hoping for a solution good luck.",

Guessing it was: \"0.06\" Sorry about the result of your Watchful Waiting (aka Wishful Waiting ) leading to more advanced disease than preferable. Hope that everything is now in the past you are doing perfectly well! Your case provides good reason for clinicians to \"reassess\" Watchful Waiting in patients whose PSA continues to rise without explanation. If we could jump back in time, I'm certain you would have taken action by the time your PSA doubled from 4 to 8 as opposed to waiting for it to hit 17. The husband of \"Now What?\" appears to be in a similar situation with his PSA going from 15 to 22. Hopefully the cause of his rise is not advancing PC and hopefully they have not \"Watchfully Waited\" too long to take action to eradicate PC in the early stages. Good luck & Best Wishes! MF Hi Michael sorry for typo post psa was. (0.60 ) its been almost ten months since my last zoladex three month depo. My last test was up from 0.01 to 0.04, energy level is still low, haven\u0092t had my T checked yet,I assume it's still fairly low based on the way I feel. Two years on ADT was hell. My PSA is going to have too rise quick before I go back on ADT. The three point rise doesn't bother me at this point,I'm concentrating on trying to get my health back in shape plus regaining the muscle I lost due to HT. Over all i feeling pretty good compared to what I felt like six months ago.I do hope your life partner is do well and you two aren't stressing to much. Take care",

Guessing it was: \"0.06\" Sorry about the result of your Watchful Waiting (aka Wishful Waiting ) leading to more advanced disease than preferable. Hope that everything is now in the past you are doing perfectly well! Your case provides good reason for clinicians to \"reassess\" Watchful Waiting in patients whose PSA continues to rise without explanation. If we could jump back in time, I'm certain you would have taken action by the time your PSA doubled from 4 to 8 as opposed to waiting for it to hit 17. The husband of \"Now What?\" appears to be in a similar situation with his PSA going from 15 to 22. Hopefully the cause of his rise is not advancing PC and hopefully they have not \"Watchfully Waited\" too long to take action to eradicate PC in the early stages. Good luck & Best Wishes! MF Hi Michael sorry for typo post psa was. (0.60 ) its been almost ten months since my last zoladex three month depo. My last test was up from 0.01 to 0.04, energy level is still low, haven\u0092t had my T checked yet,I assume it's still fairly low based on the way I feel. Two years on ADT was hell. My PSA is going to have too rise quick before I go back on ADT. The three point rise doesn't bother me at this point,I'm concentrating on trying to get my health back in shape plus regaining the muscle I lost due to HT. Over all i feeling pretty good compared to what I felt like six months ago.I do hope your life partner is do well and you two aren't stressing to much. Take care",

Now experiencing some cystitis, plus a nagging pain in my left hip that radiates down my leg and across my lower back.Also bowl movements are a guessing game they work but never know how much I passed until I look in the bowl.

He explained to me that even though he didn't cut any nerves the imflammation caused by the surgery is quite extensive and the imflammation from it puts alot of pressure on the nerves..Also take into account when the prostate is removed there is a good size gap left between the bladder And urethra....Ilance Iam 10 months post opp still experiencing the same type of pains not as often but every once and a while there they are . When I had my surgery my doc said he had a tough time of it because of past hernia repairs I had done, had to move a lot stuff around....",
