      "Content": "Hi all. I knew this was gonna be so confusing. I would appreciate advice from you pros. 57 years old, good health. My Prostate has always been enlarged. I\u0092ve always had frequent urination. I remember road trips in my late 20s early 30s where I had difficulty holding it for 2 hours. First PSA test was 10 years ago age 47, 3.2. Nobody seemed concerned. It\u0092s always been 3.2 - 3.6. A year ago it was 4.4 right after monumental stress after my Mom passed away. DRE normal but enlarged, GP said prostatitis - antibiotics then retest was 3.9. September 2018 it was 3.8. Massive stress again since then, including an ER visit for diverticulitis mid February. Serious antibiotics cleared that up, but my next PSA test was mid march, and I had only felt over the diverticulitis for a week prior. Two days before PSA I was peeing like crazy, much more than usual. PSA came back 5.2 and that has me spooked. I also lost 20 lbs since September PSA, so perhaps September PSA was higher than it seemed due to increased weight hiding it. I know at this point it can be anything. Stress, prostatitis, PCa, UTI, etc. I still felt pretty inflamed from the diverticulitis just a week before the test. I also had an infected tooth at the time. Had a root canal today. Who knows how much inflammation I\u0092ve had in my body from those two things at the time of the test. And yet I know, I shouldn\u0092t be ignoring those numbers. I don\u0092t think my GP will know what to do. How do I find a great urologist? I didn\u0092t even get free PSA on this last test but in September it was 27%. I\u0092m scared of a biopsy just because I\u0092ve been reading that infections, while not common, can get quite serious. I read somewhere that on an individual basis the risk is as high as 14%. Plus they\u0092re only 70% accurate, is that correct? If it\u0092s urologist time how do I find a good one? What about this 4Kscore test? I\u0092m confused and scared and feel I need to learn a lot rather than rely on my GP. Any pointers would be appreciated. Thanks. Man you guys are troopers.",

      "Content": "Hi all. I knew this was gonna be so confusing. I would appreciate advice from you pros. 57 years old, good health. My Prostate has always been enlarged. I\u0092ve always had frequent urination. I remember road trips in my late 20s early 30s where I had difficulty holding it for 2 hours. First PSA test was 10 years ago age 47, 3.2. Nobody seemed concerned. It\u0092s always been 3.2 - 3.6. A year ago it was 4.4 right after monumental stress after my Mom passed away. DRE normal but enlarged, GP said prostatitis - antibiotics then retest was 3.9. September 2018 it was 3.8. Massive stress again since then, including an ER visit for diverticulitis mid February. Serious antibiotics cleared that up, but my next PSA test was mid march, and I had only felt over the diverticulitis for a week prior. Two days before PSA I was peeing like crazy, much more than usual. PSA came back 5.2 and that has me spooked. I also lost 20 lbs since September PSA, so perhaps September PSA was higher than it seemed due to increased weight hiding it. I know at this point it can be anything. Stress, prostatitis, PCa, UTI, etc. I still felt pretty inflamed from the diverticulitis just a week before the test. I also had an infected tooth at the time. Had a root canal today. Who knows how much inflammation I\u0092ve had in my body from those two things at the time of the test. And yet I know, I shouldn\u0092t be ignoring those numbers. I don\u0092t think my GP will know what to do. How do I find a great urologist? I didn\u0092t even get free PSA on this last test but in September it was 27%. I\u0092m scared of a biopsy just because I\u0092ve been reading that infections, while not common, can get quite serious. I read somewhere that on an individual basis the risk is as high as 14%. Plus they\u0092re only 70% accurate, is that correct? If it\u0092s urologist time how do I find a good one? What about this 4Kscore test? I\u0092m confused and scared and feel I need to learn a lot rather than rely on my GP. Any pointers would be appreciated. Thanks. Man you guys are troopers.",
