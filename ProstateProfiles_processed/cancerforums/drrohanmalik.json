      "Content": "hi. my dad is 61 and was diagnosed with prostate cancer. he underwent surgery but since the seminal vesicles were involved he was also put on radiation and hormone therapy. after 1 year of hormone therapy his PSA is still undetectable but he has developed swelling on his fingers in both hands. his thyroid is normal and a bone scan is not showing any arthritis or metastasis. it looks like fluid accumulation and it causes him stiffness and pain. i was wondering if any others have experienced such a symptom and if any therapy worked. he cant take NSAIDS because he has intermittent bleeding due to radiation cystitis. thanks",
