      "Content": "I am 63-years old and, strangely, had my first, raging prostate infection when I was only 22-years old. I was a professional musician, from a very young age, and I've always wondered if sitting on a hard piano bench was the catalyst for that original issue. I was playing a gig one night, and had to quit early - my wife drove me to the hospital and I presumed I had a bad kidney infection. When the docs said something like, \"Wow - you've got a prostate infection\" my reaction was along the lines of, \"What the hell is a 'prostate'???\". I was sick for a week with fever, a discharge, etc. Anyway, now pushing 64 (in February), I've done alright with that deal. I have a had a couple bouts of epididymitis, but it's always gone away with Cipro and some time. Then, about 3 months ago, I started waking up at night because my testicles hurt. I would get up, move around, and the pain would go away. Then, for about the last 4 weeks, my testicles hurt - pretty much - all the time. I also have some discomfort above the groin. I have no problems with urination. I have has some mild discomfort with ejaculation, but I chalked that up to a \"funky\" prostate - not cancer. I've been gutting and remodeling a house, and this has put a stop to everything. This has gotten bad enough that I went to Aftercare about 2 weeks ago. The doc, there, suspected epididymitis but wanted me to come in for an testicular ultra-sound. You could only go on Tuesdays, it was the holidays, and I am going next Tuesday. Then, I broke down and went to my own doc - he seemed really concerned about prostate cancer and drew blood to check my PSA (which was very low, about 3 years ago). I am kind of a nervous wreck, waiting for these results. I've done a bunch of reading and I don't find much that lists testicular pain as a symptom of prostate cancer. Of course, it could be testicular cancer. I hope that I haven't breached any etiquette by posting, here, as I have no idea whether or not I have prostate cancer. Something is definitely not right, though. Is testicular pain, of this kind, commonly associated with prostate cancer? I figured that folks here would have the most insight. Thanks for reading, and, I'd appreciate any input.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 ^^^^^^What Michael said!! A doc-in-a-box and a general practitioner are fine if you have a boo-boo and need a Band-Aid on your knee. With ongoing pain, you need a specialist. Yep - it's very apparent that I need to see a specialist. My doc began processing the paperwork a few nights ago. And, as someone said, waiting for the results is the worst part. I woke up, today, and the old testicles were killin' me. Such an odd topic for public discussion but, as the saying goes, \"it is what it is\" - and, whatever it is, I need to get it fixed. Thanks, again, for the input (to all). I will post more when I get some results. And yes, Wade, at this point in my life I would rather be without a prostate than have all the problems........ugh.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 ^^^^^^What Michael said!! A doc-in-a-box and a general practitioner are fine if you have a boo-boo and need a Band-Aid on your knee. With ongoing pain, you need a specialist. Yep - it's very apparent that I need to see a specialist. My doc began processing the paperwork a few nights ago. And, as someone said, waiting for the results is the worst part. I woke up, today, and the old testicles were killin' me. Such an odd topic for public discussion but, as the saying goes, \"it is what it is\" - and, whatever it is, I need to get it fixed. Thanks, again, for the input (to all). I will post more when I get some results. And yes, Wade, at this point in my life I would rather be without a prostate than have all the problems........ugh.",

I couldn't really find anything that said this kind of pain was associated with cancer - but my doc seemed kinda nervous about it..... if it's epididymitis I'm havin' a helluva time gettin' rid of it - but I've read that it can be chronic. I guess I just need to wait and see about the PSA - I should get it mid-week. Thanks again for everyone's input. Good luck to everyone, here.",
