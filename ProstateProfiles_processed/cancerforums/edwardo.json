After 1.5 weeks I quit using pads; I'd say I'm 99% continent now; just a drop or two a few times a week. Pathology report: Gleason 7 (4+3); T3a I will have my first PSA test in mid Oct One concern right now is that my left testicle is still sore to the touch after 2 months; no swelling. The tumor was on the left side of prostate. Anyone have testicular pain at 2 months? Otherwise, no pain of any kind after about a month. Thanks, Eddie",

      "Content": "Update. I posted back in May that my PSA had risen from 0.03 to 0.05 and the surgeon rescheduled my next test for 3 instead of 6 months. Well, I had the test done last Wednesday and learned Friday that my PSA has risen again to 0.1; so doubled in the last 3 months. He says I have recurrence and should start salvage radiation therapy but said hormone therapy is not indicated. So, I have a consult with the radiation oncologist at my surgeon's urology group in Birmingham, AL (Urology Centers of Alabama) on Sept. 2. The problem is Birmingham is 2 hours away making it necessary to spend weekdays there. That's not such a problem in that I'm retired and they offer free lodging (I also have a travel trailer and a nice state park is about 15 minutes away). But, I'd rather have it done locally at the East AL Medical Center in Opelika, AL if the equipment/personnel are equal. From what I can tell on their websites, both use IMRT/IGRT equipment. My questions to you: 1. What are the questions to ask each center to determine who has the latest/best equipment and experience? 2. While I don't want HT and the surgeon says its not indicated, should I be concerned NOT to have it? 3. Should I ask for bone/abdominal scans or are my numbers too low to pick up? 3. Any other questions that I should ask? I must say I have had a variety of emotions since Friday; not many of which are pleasant; add to that, my mother has moderate Alzheimer's and is driving me nuts. Thank you all for any assistance. This is a great forum.",

      "Content": "Update on the update!!! After talking to the RO's at the local hospital and Urology Centers of Alabama in B'ham, I've decided to go with Urology Centers. Both use the same Varian Clinac machine. What swayed my decision: 1) UCA focuses primarily on prostate cases and the local hospital does all kinds of cancer, 2) UCA uses fiducials versus lining up on bone structure, 3) I just feel more comfortable at UCA since they did my RP. Both recommended around 68 Gy in 39 fractions; both RO's said HT is not indicated. So, next Tuesday I get fiducials implanted and the following Tuesday I get a CT scan and simulation. It will be sometime in October before I can get worked into the rotation for actual treatments. A huge burden has been lifted off my shoulders by just making this decision and getting a plan to follow. I also just became a grandfather for the first time on Sept. 6. The little fellow was 4 weeks premature; my daughter had to be induced early because of very high blood pressure. He spent a week in NICU due to respiratory problems, but came home this past Monday. Mom and son are doing very well. I'm one happy grandpa!!!",

      "Content": "Update. I posted back in May that my PSA had risen from 0.03 to 0.05 and the surgeon rescheduled my next test for 3 instead of 6 months. Well, I had the test done last Wednesday and learned Friday that my PSA has risen again to 0.1; so doubled in the last 3 months. He says I have recurrence and should start salvage radiation therapy but said hormone therapy is not indicated. So, I have a consult with the radiation oncologist at my surgeon's urology group in Birmingham, AL (Urology Centers of Alabama) on Sept. 2. The problem is Birmingham is 2 hours away making it necessary to spend weekdays there. That's not such a problem in that I'm retired and they offer free lodging (I also have a travel trailer and a nice state park is about 15 minutes away). But, I'd rather have it done locally at the East AL Medical Center in Opelika, AL if the equipment/personnel are equal. From what I can tell on their websites, both use IMRT/IGRT equipment. My questions to you: 1. What are the questions to ask each center to determine who has the latest/best equipment and experience? 2. While I don't want HT and the surgeon says its not indicated, should I be concerned NOT to have it? 3. Should I ask for bone/abdominal scans or are my numbers too low to pick up? 3. Any other questions that I should ask? I must say I have had a variety of emotions since Friday; not many of which are pleasant; add to that, my mother has moderate Alzheimer's and is driving me nuts. Thank you all for any assistance. This is a great forum.",

      "Content": "Update on the update!!! After talking to the RO's at the local hospital and Urology Centers of Alabama in B'ham, I've decided to go with Urology Centers. Both use the same Varian Clinac machine. What swayed my decision: 1) UCA focuses primarily on prostate cases and the local hospital does all kinds of cancer, 2) UCA uses fiducials versus lining up on bone structure, 3) I just feel more comfortable at UCA since they did my RP. Both recommended around 68 Gy in 39 fractions; both RO's said HT is not indicated. So, next Tuesday I get fiducials implanted and the following Tuesday I get a CT scan and simulation. It will be sometime in October before I can get worked into the rotation for actual treatments. A huge burden has been lifted off my shoulders by just making this decision and getting a plan to follow. I also just became a grandfather for the first time on Sept. 6. The little fellow was 4 weeks premature; my daughter had to be induced early because of very high blood pressure. He spent a week in NICU due to respiratory problems, but came home this past Monday. Mom and son are doing very well. I'm one happy grandpa!!!",
