Doctor wants me to stay on Lupron for another year, then we'll ween me and see what happens. I know Lupron can drive PSA numbers down but can Lupron alone make the PSA too low to measure?",

      "Content": "RobLee My PSA post op plus 3 months was 0.6. My latest PSA test that I referred to was done as part of my annual physical at my local clinic. They apparently didn't do the more accurate test my RO does. So \"undetectable\" was my term, not their's for <0.1 total and <0.02 free PSA. Now my question, if Lupron by itself is able to drive the PSA to at or near zero, does that mean the Cancer, if any remaining after my RT, is inactive or just it's ability to produce measurable PSA numbers? In other words, in the presence of Lupron, is PSA still a good proxy for Cancer cell activity?",

      "Content": "RobLee My PSA post op plus 3 months was 0.6. My latest PSA test that I referred to was done as part of my annual physical at my local clinic. They apparently didn't do the more accurate test my RO does. So \"undetectable\" was my term, not their's for <0.1 total and <0.02 free PSA. Now my question, if Lupron by itself is able to drive the PSA to at or near zero, does that mean the Cancer, if any remaining after my RT, is inactive or just it's ability to produce measurable PSA numbers? In other words, in the presence of Lupron, is PSA still a good proxy for Cancer cell activity?",

Still measurable PSA afterwards which led me to salvage radiation in the fall of 2017 along with starting hormonal treatment. Had my 7th lupron injection yesterday. I still can't believe how painless they are. One more to go in April. My PSA has been undetectable for over a year and a half and my Oncologist tells me I have a 50-60% chance of having been cured. If not then it is still very unlikely it will ever kill me. My experience on Lupron has been fatigue, lack of energy, loss of most body hair, zero libido, loss of muscle tone etc etc. Not too big a price to pay and I am assured the effects will reverse once the treatments ends. My care has been managed by the Banner Cancer Health Care Center which is an offshoot of the University of Arizona Medical Center in Tucson. My Oncologist is an MD, PHD and the Director of the Radiation Oncology Department. I feel truly blessed for the care I have received. My hope is that others here will fare as well as I have.",

T is now <12. While a 50-60% chance of a cure isn't 100%, it's certainly better than the 0% chance I had post surgery, and the low chance of it ever killing me is probably more important than anything else. What I'm curious about is why they gave me these encouraging statistics now and not 6 months or so ago? Perhaps it was necessary to confirm the unmeasurable PSA and be sure I could tolerate Lupron. Wish I had remembered to ask but I was a bit discombobulated by encouraging news and their general upbeat tone. I felt like I was no longer just a victim but closer to a survivor. Sure looking forward to getting off this Lupron but with one more shot in April I guess it will be still quite a while before the boys get back to work producing T. Wishing all the best. Nick",

T is now <12. While a 50-60% chance of a cure isn't 100%, it's certainly better than the 0% chance I had post surgery, and the low chance of it ever killing me is probably more important than anything else. What I'm curious about is why they gave me these encouraging statistics now and not 6 months or so ago? Perhaps it was necessary to confirm the unmeasurable PSA and be sure I could tolerate Lupron. Wish I had remembered to ask but I was a bit discombobulated by encouraging news and their general upbeat tone. I felt like I was no longer just a victim but closer to a survivor. Sure looking forward to getting off this Lupron but with one more shot in April I guess it will be still quite a while before the boys get back to work producing T. Wishing all the best. Nick",

Out of the hospital after 24 hours. No followup chemo or radiation required. My PSA was 38 and my Gleason score was 8 at biopsy and downgraded to 7 post op. 7 days since the catheter was taken out after 10 days (and not a moment too soon) and I wouldn't say I have any bladder control yet but I have some influence... Hoping for return of full control but I know it takes patience. Happy to be alive. Nick P.",

Correct, it was actually a couple of months before the surgery, so I don't really know what it was at surgery but I'm sure it didn't go down. The 1/2 Life of circulating PSA is approx 2-3 days so by 30 days, it should be approaching it's lowest level First time anyone's told me this. Thanks. Did you have a standard or ultrasensitive PSA (uPSA) test? If uPSA, (the result will be out to 3 decimal points), be sure to go to The Same Lab and get The Exact Same PSA test next time. Only then can you compare your first 2 post op PSA values It's the same lab but I don't know if it's ultra sensitive or not. I'll ask. Your final path report downgraded you from G8 to G7. Congrats! This still places you in an intermediate risk category. Yes, that was good to hear and my Urologist/Surgeon said that based on the pathology report follow on treatment in the form of Radiation/Chemo was not indicated, at least not at this time. I'm sure hoping for a PSA of zero but the 4 week interval had me worried.",

Correct, it was actually a couple of months before the surgery, so I don't really know what it was at surgery but I'm sure it didn't go down....My concern is that after only 4 weeks since surgery, has my PSA (38 at surgery) had time to settle out by now? Will I show a misleadingly high score now due to the closeness to my surgery?...Will I show a misleadingly high score now due to the closeness to my surgery? Nick...Correct, it was actually a couple of months before the surgery, so I don't really know what it was at surgery but I'm sure it didn't go down. The 1/2 Life of circulating PSA is approx 2-3 days so by 30 days, it should be approaching it's lowest level First time anyone's told me this....Glad I chose to have it removed. 3 weeks post op today and feeling good....The Surgeon requested a PSA test one week before the appointment but for a variety or reasons, my long distance from Tucson requires I have the test done locally, Thanksgiving next week, etc, I had it done today. My concern is that after only 4 weeks since surgery, has my PSA (38 at surgery) had time to settle out by now?...MM My surgery in 9/16 left me with measurable PSA so we decided to go the radiation route in 9-10/17 with the hope of affecting a cure.
