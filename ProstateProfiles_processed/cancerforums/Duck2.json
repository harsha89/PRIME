      "Content": "Originally Posted by daddypix I ve gotten screened over the last few years and everything was fine.I ve developed urinary symptoms over the past year and last year had blood in my semen that went away so i didnt think much about it since my DRE/psa test were normal the previous 3 years.Now every since my exam ive had pain in that area between my anus n scrutum with an increase in symptoms, im hoping its psychosomatic. Im scheduled to see a urologist may 8.Dr google claims that its a 50% chance that its cancer.Has anyone had the new biomarker test using urine before getting a biopsy.or mri any suggestions on my approach or just follow dr. s protocol. im worried stiff that i ve had for 2 or 3 years and it just wasnt showing up on screening. I am not an MD, but my advice is to get a 3T MRI and a biopsy. If the URO you see has a let\u0092s watch this attitude, get a new URO.",

The PSA dates were wrong - here's the list with the accurate years: 12/2017= 2.01 06/18/2018 = 2.62 09/05/2018 = 2.28 01/03/2019 = 3.12 01/07/2019 - 3.23 For what it is worth, the PSA tests were completed after the digital exams except for the 06/18 and 09/05 readings - I read that could add some to the total yet the trend certainly is upward here unfortunately. I feel decent about my urologist - he's out of Northwestern Hospital in Chicago. Also relieved that I was able to get in to see him next Wednesday to discuss the next steps. Notwithstanding the general unpleasantness of what I would expect from a biopsy and the risks of infection, I am leaning towards it especially if I can get the fusion guided one or under some sort of general sedation. I've got a lot of time on my hands now courtesy some recent job cuts at Xerox that trickled down to their subsidiaries where I worked (yea, it's been a GREAT 30 days here) so I suppose it makes sense to knock this out now. We'll see what he says next week and move ahead. Thanks again for all of the guidance guys. Just my experiance on the biopsy. Sedation is not needed. The procedure was totally painless, although I had a lot of anxiety. After the local wears off, I did have about 30 minutes were I felt ill and had local rental pain. Suggest you take a lidocaine product for you rear and some Aleve with you.",

Today is the 11th day since my biopsy and I noticed I\u2019m still shooting out small clots and brownish blood in the urine, which I\u2019m not alarmed about. However the BM seem to be putting out a decent amount of bright red blood this morning. The toilet paper was basically bright red across the width and breadth of it. I got caught in traffic yesterday and really had to have a BM so I\u2019m not sure If that extended pressure might have reopened the wounds from the biopsy. No temperature and I\u2019m definitely not hemorrhaging or anything like that, just blood coming out as the bowels move. Problem to worry about or \u201cmeh, suck it up buttercup\u201d I did not get brown blood until day 12 post biopsy. Blood from the other end I suspected were Hemmeroids. Treated with some AD ointment and it ended.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi there, gopher, Welcome to the forum. About half of prostatectomy patients have this problem after surgery, including myself. But it is usually only temporary as part of the healing process and goes away. I would think that yours should be cleared up by now, although I also wonder how many kegel exercises you are doing? My instructions from Mayo Clinic were to just do a total of SEVEN REPS per day -- and that too many reps can actually weaken the muscles. Let's see what others say..... What Kegels were they having you do? The instructions I have a a basic keakel 3 times a day from CC, but I saw a 7 position Kegel excercise in line that made a lot of sense. Standing, siting, rolling out of bed, ect.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wtdedula Thanks or both of your advice, garyi, and Djin and the other folks who offered suggestions too. Yes, garyi - CC is supposed to be #1 in urology, and #5 in cancer. I think my surgeon did pretty good since there were no complications of the actual surgery and he can't see microscopic cancer cells that could escape. Based upon my extensive research and reading some folks BCR even from hospitals more respected than the Cleveland Clinic and even without positive margins. Well I made an appointment with a RO for early in March at a Cleveland Clinic facility near me. I'll see what he suggests. I think I'll ask for monthly ultra sensitive PSA tests just to keep tabs on what my PSA is doing more closely. I am nervous because I want to knock out any remaining cancer cells before they get out of hand. I probably should get a second opinion too from another RO too, perhaps not from the Cleveland Clinic. There are several other pretty good hospitals near me. I see some folks pulling the trigger on SRT at ridiculously low PSA values like .018 providing they see a trend upward. While I've passed .02, I'm willing to pull the trigger too if I see a clear trend upward too after beginning monthly PSA tests. But I'm also anxious to hear what the RO thinks too. I was hoping to delay SRT until I retire next year but that may not be possible to wait that long. Tim Unless you are considering OSU, I would not be getting a second opinion here in Ohio. Not that our hospitals here are bad, but they are not top tier cancer centers.",

It appears from your sig that the cause of your PSA is your positive margin and lymphoascular invasion. So there is likely some cancerous tissue remaining local to your prostate bed. My non-professional recommendation would be to treat it NOW before it leaves the pelvic area and moves on to other parts of your body. At that point it would become incurable, and you would be destined for lifelong HT, or a slow painful death. You are much too young for that. Hit this thing with everything available NOW to knock it out before it takes over. Good luck! You make some valid points and I do not advocate no treatment, but with the LVI is there is a reasonable possibility that things are not still regional. Going through RT with possible zero benefit will likely be the recommended treatment.",

I am nervous because I want to knock out any remaining cancer cells before they get out of hand. I probably should get a second opinion too from another RO too, perhaps not from the Cleveland Clinic. There are several other pretty good hospitals near me. I see some folks pulling the trigger on SRT at ridiculously low PSA values like .018 providing they see a trend upward. While I've passed .02, I'm willing to pull the trigger too if I see a clear trend upward too after beginning monthly PSA tests. But I'm also anxious to hear what the RO thinks too. I was hoping to delay SRT until I retire next year but that may not be possible to wait that long. Tim Unless you are considering OSU, I would not be getting a second opinion here in Ohio.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wtdedula Thanks or both of your advice, garyi, and Djin and the other folks who offered suggestions too. Yes, garyi - CC is supposed to be #1 in urology, and #5 in cancer. I think my surgeon did pretty good since there were no complications of the actual surgery and he can't see microscopic cancer cells that could escape. Based upon my extensive research and reading some folks BCR even from hospitals more respected than the Cleveland Clinic and even without positive margins. Well I made an appointment with a RO for early in March at a Cleveland Clinic facility near me. I'll see what he suggests. I think I'll ask for monthly ultra sensitive PSA tests just to keep tabs on what my PSA is doing more closely. I am nervous because I want to knock out any remaining cancer cells before they get out of hand. I probably should get a second opinion too from another RO too, perhaps not from the Cleveland Clinic. There are several other pretty good hospitals near me. I see some folks pulling the trigger on SRT at ridiculously low PSA values like .018 providing they see a trend upward. While I've passed .02, I'm willing to pull the trigger too if I see a clear trend upward too after beginning monthly PSA tests. But I'm also anxious to hear what the RO thinks too. I was hoping to delay SRT until I retire next year but that may not be possible to wait that long. Tim Unless you are considering OSU, I would not be getting a second opinion here in Ohio. Not that our hospitals here are bad, but they are not top tier cancer centers.",

With your promising negative bone scan and CTs, I hope your PCa proves to be prostate-confined. Djin Three points, with one 100% core I do not have much confidence in the PCa being confined. Within a 300 mi radius Cleveland runs ads, but that has no effect on my decision to go there. Cancer Centers still send me personalized emails marketing me to go there.",

URO says things will be slow to improve first 6 weeks.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee Busby, you are a young man and your pathology was not that bad. It appears from your sig that the cause of your PSA is your positive margin and lymphoascular invasion. So there is likely some cancerous tissue remaining local to your prostate bed. My non-professional recommendation would be to treat it NOW before it leaves the pelvic area and moves on to other parts of your body. At that point it would become incurable, and you would be destined for lifelong HT, or a slow painful death. You are much too young for that. Hit this thing with everything available NOW to knock it out before it takes over. Good luck! You make some valid points and I do not advocate no treatment, but with the LVI is there is a reasonable possibility that things are not still regional. Going through RT with possible zero benefit will likely be the recommended treatment.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Trex Dino Quick introduction: Biopsy week ago, results 24 hours ago. Everything is a bit of a blur and working on getting a handle of things today. Researching, ordering books, making doc appointments, scheduling bone and CT scans as well as adding my five-year colonoscopy follow-up. Found this forum today and just signed up. Biopsy diagnosis: 13 samples, (6) Gleason score 7, (2) Gleason score 8, (4) Gleason score 9 and (1) suspicious. Staging is 3. CT in 2016 (little blood and stones due to dehydration working outside in extreme heat) and MRI Dec 2018 show prostate normal size with no enlargement (comparing the 2016 CT to the 2018 MRI). PSA Nov 2018 7.1 Prescribed Proscar and Flomax PSA Dec 2018 4.1 (PSA drop due to Proscar ?) Yesterday, off of Proscar and Flomax. Age 63. Still coming to terms with all this. Sorry about your DX. I joined here a few weeks ago. Be patient as best you can the medical wheels move very slowly and the answers you want people will not be able to answer. The more you search the internet the more contradictory data may become. As I am not far in front of you in this process, eating and hydrating properly can be a challange and an afternoon nap helps a lot with the emotional anxiety. I have also noticed that minor aches and pains I used to ignor emotionally drag me down. Ibuprofen is a big help. If they have not told you, you are High risk. Now is a good time to decide if you are going to a cancer center of excellence or staying with who you have. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Hi Mags, While the second PSA reading is a big jump, make certain you get at least one, if not two, confirmatory readings. Did you doc suggest a repeat PSA in 30 days? That is often done because it is fairly soon after the troubling report, but long enough that, if the PSA is indeed rising, it may come back even a bit higher than the last. Or it might shed light on an erroneous reading. While the main negative finding was EPE, it was focal and not extensive; and there was also LVI+. By themselves I think you could safely wait to see if the PSA plateaus at a non-threatening value. But coupled with a high Decipher score, I can see the reason for concern. The Decipher test itself is being used as one factor in decision-making. Studies have validated it. But do note that it provides two risks/probabilities, not guarantees of anything. Note that the Average risk range is 0.45--6.0, so your husband's score is just high enough to put him in the High-Risk group. In other words, your husband's risk for metastases might be just a faction higher than someone with a Decipher score at the top of the Average-risk category. You may want to discuss that point at your next visit. You should note that the GRID report is provided to doctors for \"research purposes\" and it is stated by GenomeDx that it is not for clinical decision-making. In my GRID, it said my cancer's theoretical response to ADT is a terrible 1 on a scale of 0 to 100, 100 being best. When I pointed this out to my uro/surgeon, he said, that while he was told and reads that about 10% of men have no initial response to HT, he has never had a patient that didn't have some response, at least initially. And he, too, pointed out that the GRID has not been clinically validated like the Decipher has been. That said, I'm not understanding fully why a post-op radiation response would be that low. We know that some men have recurrence after RT as their primary treatment. It's possible that this is what the low score is reflecting, but I don't know for certain. Have you discussed the possibility of a RT+ADT combo? A suggestion: call GenomeDx and say you are possibly facing post-RP treatment and ask to speak to someone about the Decipher and GRID results you received. The company was good about answering my email questions. My take-away is use Decipher as an additional factor; but I would rely on my doc's experience over the GRID report. I don't know if the GRID report is provided unless it is requested. I was under the impression that most men didn't see theirs. I hope that helps, Djin One element I see folks fixed on is a rise in PSA is likely from PCa in the prostate bed. The D report could be reflecting systemic spread that radiation isn\u2019t going to touch.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the encouragement. The reason for the early test is I have been experiencing hip pain for about 2 years prior to DX and always believed it was arthritis, but now not so sure. .3 the maximum value stated by my URO for 30 days so I was hoping for a lower value. Keep in mind my PCa was a low PSA producer from the beginning. Will have another test in 30 days. Decipher test was ordered and will be doing ART in 5 months. Decision on ADT to be made based on D-score. Honestly believe the chance a cure is rather slim at this point.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by IceStationZebra I have a coworker...staff member actually. We talked about prostate issues previously and he said he had issues and was taking flowmax. So I figured he was in good care. He told me two days ago that his GP had told him his prostate had grown since the last exam. He apparently wasn\u0092t regularly seeing the urologist. I asked what the GP said or did, he doubled his flowmax. What the heck? The GP has watched his PSA in the high 3\u0092s for years and said nothing. So I asked him what his urologist said at the last visit and he said \u0093he told me you don\u0092t have prostate cancer, don\u0092t worry\u0094. So he stopped going. That might not sound that terribly bad until you realize the poor guy is 42 or 43 years old. African American. His PSA has been in the upper 3\u0092s for years. It was 3.7 at last year\u0092s check. Oh yeah and no family history unless you count both his dad and his uncle on his father\u0092s side who had prostate cancer. Oh and the urologist proclaimed he didn\u0092t have cancer without doing free PSA, pca3, 4K, an MRI or a BIOPSY. For the love of all that\u0092s good and holy...he\u0092s been failed by both doctors in a very bad way. How can that urologist even make that comment with no factual testing basis? I sat him down and explained the things I could and gave him a roadmap of what I\u0092ve done and been through. I tried to impart the gravity of what he could be facing without terrifying him, but he\u0092s motivated now. I gave him my doctor\u0092s name but warned him about the office staff. He needs some immediate help and a biopsy. What is wrong with these doctors? While I agree your co-worker needs a Uro, assuming the PSA is or is not cancer with values in the 3s is not a valid. Heck, I have a PSA of 5.11 and I know a high number of people my age with higher values seeing their URO with no biopsy. 90% of the biopsies come back negative. Because there is no cancer, BPH,and the needles missing the lesions when there is. That is what ISO PSA test is supposed to due - eliminate unneeded biopsies.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by KarlEmagne That's the problem. They wouldn't be scheduling me for anything at this point. They told me there's no evidence of robotic surgery any better than laparoscopic, there's equally no evidence of any positive effects of biopsy results earlier than those 6 weeks because I cannot be operated any sooner, and why would you expose clueless patients to biopsy results sheets anyway. And no, my uro claims to not have those results, aside of being reluctant to give them to me without appointment. IMHO a lot of evidence Santé Québec have serious attitude problems. Quebec or not, I still have to believe if you had an very advanced PCa they would be fitting you in and scheduling additional tests very quickly.",

Is it possible to get a decipher score with a low value with that pathology? Seems this test for grades 4 and 5 would not be a game changer for anyone.",
