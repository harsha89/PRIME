At this with confirmation from my surgeon i have started the process of moving forward with having the AUS installed. Earlier this week i had a urodynamic test done not to sure what that will show but one thing is after my bladder was filled i could not stop the release.

There are 2 cuts one about 4 inches below belly button and one between the scrotum and anus. There is also a release device in your scotum. Very little pain involved but do have some discomfort at the base of scrotum. I think this is from wearing pads and they apply pressure. As far as keeping away infection i shower about 3times a day and have had no problems.. since is not turned on yet don't know how effective it is. Hopefully,works as advertised",
