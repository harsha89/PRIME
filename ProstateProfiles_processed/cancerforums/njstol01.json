      "Content": "Originally Posted by JustBrandon Hello again, you may recall me posting in january that my dad's psa had risen to 0.13 and i had expressed concern over it. Well they did a re test today and the doctorbsaid \"Mr Otinger, i Have good news, your PSA has fallen to <0.1, which is essentially ZERO. The ultrasensative assay we use can sometimes glitch and overestimate values, and that is what happened with your January test. You are good to go, and continue to enjoy being free of prostate cancer. ☺☺☺☺ BIG sigh of relief there. So i can happily say he is still in \"Club Zero\" Perhaps I'm missing something...have all these PSAs been done using the same tests? While the 0.13 may have been erroneous, <0.1 is nowhere as near zero as << 0.04 as in the earlier tests. Obviously, something to keep an eye on!",

      "Content": "Hi Dan, I look at your latest post with keen interest as I appear to very similar to you- RALP on 3/8/17, Final biopsy data G4+3, 4mm margin, pT2c, nodes and tissues negative. The possibility of salvage radiation was mentioned, however this would hinge on PSA #, which of course have not been done yet. So I see it somewhat alarming (to me being so close to in your shoes) that you are already considering radiation even before your first PSA result. Are you and your doc being too aggressive, or is my uro being too conservative and missing something?",

      "Content": "Hi Dan, I look at your latest post with keen interest as I appear to very similar to you- RALP on 3/8/17, Final biopsy data G4+3, 4mm margin, pT2c, nodes and tissues negative. The possibility of salvage radiation was mentioned, however this would hinge on PSA #, which of course have not been done yet. So I see it somewhat alarming (to me being so close to in your shoes) that you are already considering radiation even before your first PSA result. Are you and your doc being too aggressive, or is my uro being too conservative and missing something?",

I had never had free PSA analyzed in my case, so I was wondering what it was about and after reading a little bit last night I see having a low % free PSA may be an indication of cancer. Couldn't find an explanation why. Intuitively I would think if you had a tumor actively secreting PSA at a higher level then the normal prostate tissue would that it would likely lead to higher free PSA %, but I guess it must become protein bound more quickly then normal PSA?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by toloh For me, the sensations of the urge to urinate did not return until about 6 weeks after the cath was removed. Other than leaking around the catheter, I had no physical problems with it. funny you should mention \"leaking around the catheter\".....I was just logging on to ask that question! Just a short while ago as I was getting ready to take a shower, that urge to pee came back and for a few moments I did not fight to see what would happen and I am pretty sure that I began passing a dribble of urine at my tip around the outside of the catheter. Naively, I would guess that could be possible if somehow urine slipped around the catheter inside the bladder, could it escape down the inside of ureter on the outside of the catheter?",

And at least it didn't come back with a less accurate test result of < 0.1 , which I had some initial concern of how low their test result could go. (the doc said he was \"pretty sure\" it read to two decimal places). So I guess I qualify for a beer in the zero club?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by toloh For me, the sensations of the urge to urinate did not return until about 6 weeks after the cath was removed. Other than leaking around the catheter, I had no physical problems with it. funny you should mention \"leaking around the catheter\".....I was just logging on to ask that question! Just a short while ago as I was getting ready to take a shower, that urge to pee came back and for a few moments I did not fight to see what would happen and I am pretty sure that I began passing a dribble of urine at my tip around the outside of the catheter. Naively, I would guess that could be possible if somehow urine slipped around the catheter inside the bladder, could it escape down the inside of ureter on the outside of the catheter?",

At the 5 miles mark, it was time to get back on the bike. I worked my way from barely being able to do 10 miles to now capably handling longer outings such a 20 and 30 milers with no problems. Bottom line.. listen to your body and adjust accordingly. We're all in various states of fitness and recovery. Hey Frenchy, how many weeks post surgery did you wait to get back in the saddle? I've been doing some recumbent type cycling in the gym for a while now, but have been cleared to hit the roads - which I may do this Saturday.",

Anything I should or should not eat, drink, take or do leading up to the test? Thank you. To answer your question- it is what it is. Obviously you don't want to do anything to mask or attempt to manipulate your psa level- the numbers are what they are and you need to know them! On further pondering, if you are really asking should you avoid doing something that could increase your psa, then yes- as stated above \"your prostate has left the building\" and can no longer be influenced by diet, infection, exercise, etc. So don't worry. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Frenchy Congrats... I worked my way back up from 2 blocks to over 5 miles a day. It was not easy in the beginning. At the 5 miles mark, it was time to get back on the bike. I worked my way from barely being able to do 10 miles to now capably handling longer outings such a 20 and 30 milers with no problems. Bottom line.. listen to your body and adjust accordingly. We're all in various states of fitness and recovery. Hey Frenchy, how many weeks post surgery did you wait to get back in the saddle? I've been doing some recumbent type cycling in the gym for a while now, but have been cleared to hit the roads - which I may do this Saturday.",

Even getting use to catheter however.... Called my urologist office today to check to see when my post op appointment was scheduled for, figuring this Thursday (usual office day for him). Needless to say I was FLOORED when I was told my appt was Thursday.... 3/30!!! 22 DAYS with a bag strapped to my leg?? This seems highly unusual and pretty sure he said preop it would be 7-10 days if tests okay. Surgery and prostate removal went real well I was told, and indeed have absolutely no discomfort down there. Maybe its a scheduling mistake? Any one had a catheter in longer then 2 weeks? Thanks!

      "Content": "Hi guys, its been awhile. Had my 2 year checkup last week (my does time go quickly) and happy to report PSA was 0.00 - certainly more pleasing then the 0.01 which was 6 months ago! Overall, not much change in the last year. Still have the occasional (monthly) seepage - which is never more then a couple drops, or just the feeling that I might have a whoopsy that doesn't even make it to my underwear. One time moving around on a barstool caused it, but usually its just in the morning on a relatively empty bladder, and probably because of coffee drinking. So overall, very pleased with that. As far as erections go, not too bad. Won't ever be the way it was presurgery, but certainly well enough to keep me interested on a daily basis. The days of spontaneous \"pitching a tent\" in the morning are gone, but have noticed in the last year an occassional swelling in the morning. One thing I did note only a few weeks back was a little bit of curvature that I hadn't notice before, and my doc said that could be some mild Peyronie's happening. As long as it didn't interfere with function or was painful, I should not worry about it. So very pleased so far on the RALP outcome. Hope all is well with the rest of you!",
