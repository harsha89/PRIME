      "Content": "Hello. I\u0092m new to the site here. I\u0092ll be 66 in April and I\u0092ve been pretty healthy until my recent prostate cancer diagnosis. I take no medication. I am retired. I hike about 8 miles a couple of times a week and do a lot of shorter walk/hikes between those longer ones. I have been good about having annual physicals and the PSA score was never an issue until about a year ago. It went up to <5 in December 2013, then up to <9 in December 2014. The latter score resulted in me seeing a urologist, who took 6 biopsies and they revealed cancer on both sides of the prostate, with a Gleason level of 7 on each side. His estimation of my staging was between 2 and 3. Although I don\u0092t have the details of what the sublevels were that resulted in the 7 score, he told me it did not appear to be aggressive. Last week I had both a lower abdomen scan and a complete bone scan done. Neither of those showed any evidence that the cancer has spread from the prostate. My prostate is a little swollen but I have little to no issues with getting up at night to urinate, etc. A small issue here or there with semi-frequent urination during the day or slightly weak flow rate, but that\u0092s about it. I already visited with one radiation oncologist and I\u0092m scheduled to have a consult with a surgeon tomorrow. I have asked to speak with a different radiation oncologist tomorrow as well, only because the treatment facility is much better than that of the first radiation oncologist I saw. I got divorced a couple of years ago and I\u0092m not crazy about entering into another marriage or live-in situation with anyone else. I live alone and the bathroom and bedroom are both on the 2nd floor. There really isn\u0092t anyone available to care for me, such like a live-in partner or wife would. The ability or inability about future sexual function is not important to me. I go into this boring detail because they are the kinds of things I consider in determining how to choose which treatment option I go with. The medical facility I will be using is a drive of about an hour from home. I don\u0092t really mind having to do that daily for a couple of months, if I go with the external radiation beam treatment. I have read through many posts here and they\u0092ve been quite informative. But it\u0092s decision time for me in choosing a treatment option. Obviously, I would like to be cancer free. My longer hiking activity is usually with a small group of people. Thus, long-term incontinence would be a concern for me and something I would really like to avoid. Today, I\u0092m leaning toward external radiation beam therapy but I\u0092ll probably learn a lot more tomorrow when at the Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, PA. Any input would be appreciated. Cheers.",
