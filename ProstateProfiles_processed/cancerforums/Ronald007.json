      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Ronald, I also was a stage T2C. This means that the cancer, based on your biopsy report, is believed to still be confined to the prostate. Keep in mind that even the most aggressive prostate cancer is curable if treated in time. It is good news that there seems to be no extraprostatic spread. Hopefully the same goes for the seminal vesicles and nearby lymph nodes. If this all should be true, you would very possibly be looking at a cure. Also keep in mind that they usually do not recommend surgery unless they believe a cure is very possible. If you go through with surgery as your preferred treatment, it is extremely important that your surgeon will have previously performed at least 500-600 of whichever type of surgery you opt for (open method or robotic). Could be that some follow-up radiation treatments could be necessary after the surgery, depending on what the pathologist finds in his post-op exam of the prostate and other tissues. If weight is a major concern, it is also possible that external beam radiation, or radioactive seeding, might be a better course of action for you. It probably would be a good idea to speak with both a surgeon and a radiation oncologist to get the pros and cons from both sides. In any event, I can see lots of hope for you to have a successful treatment in whatever course you choose. Good luck! Chuck Hi Chuck, Thanks for the words of encouragement. You said that even the most aggresive cancer can be cured if treated in time. Theres my problem. I cannot find anything to back up waiting this length of time with a Gleason 8 cancer. By reading all the posts here, it would seem that the vast majority go from diagnosis to treatment in 60 to 90 days. I am now approaching 250 days. Can cancer stay confined for that length of time without becoming worse? Wondering if I had another biopsy, PCA test, CT scan, bone scan, if I would receive the same prognosis that I received last spring? I had originally asked back last spring to have radioactive seeding. I was told that wasn't an option due to the severity of the cancer. Later in the summer I asked that I have external beam radiation. That was denied as well. I was told that the long term side effects were to bad for my age. We don't have much of an option to get different opinions around here. There is only 1 CancerCare Centre which deals with everyone who gets cancer.",

Left lateral mid; Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+4=8/10, involves 15% of the core, in two foci. Left lateral apex; Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+4=8/10, involves 75% of the core, 10mm. Right medial base; Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+4=8/10, involves 5% of the core. Left medial base; Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+4=8/10, involves 40% of the core, 6mm.

There was no evidence of extra prostatic spread. I am a Gleason 8, Stage T2C. Diagnosed in April, currently waiting for surgery date!!! (In Canada) Very worried that after waiting 8 months that surgery will fail. Also, has anyone heard of anyone having to have a tummy tuck or panniculectomy along with the pc surgery? My cancer surgeon is having a plastic surgeon perform this along with him. Says this will allow him better access, as I am a big guy Thanks, Ronald",
