      "Content": "Hi Guys, PSA has gone from 11.42 Jan. 2017 to what it is now 132.02 June 2017. Was on Xtandi for a few years, went to Zytiga which did absolutely nothing. Have been on double Degarelix shots to get Testosterone down. Which it did get it down into 20's but seems too little too late on that. Started Xofigo in March. Have done 4 shots of that...no real problems. Anyway, my oncologist would like me to stop the Xofigo, and start Taxotere immediately. I'm inclined to do the 2 more shots of Xofigo, and see where we are at that point. I didn't expect the Xofigo to drop my PSA (of course I was hoping), but I did expect it to control it somewhat. I just don't like the idea of stopping in mid stream. I have been able to keep my prostate cancer known to only my close friends & family. My physical appearance has not changed in 5 1/2 years of some form of ADT. I never wanted to be defined by my illness. Of course, once I start Taxotere and my hair falls away.....the cat is out of the bag. I know it's in my future, but would like to stay away from it as long as possible. My Onc has no other options according to her. Any input would be welcome..... Thanks guys",

So, that done I know I have no excuse of not enough sleep. I still work...although part-time now, but it gives me something to do. I am needed also on my job..which motivates me. I exercise, walk alot, and basically curl 10lb weights until my arms hurt. I was on Lupron/Casodex, so I can't speak for the drugs your dad is taking. Also, I noticed a big difference in what I could do between my 60-65th birthdays, before I even had PCa....so I think age does have to be a bit of a factor. I KNOW i'm not 50 anymore! And your dad has been on a long road....I would imagine how mentally tiring that can be. All the best.. Rob",
