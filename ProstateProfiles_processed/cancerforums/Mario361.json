      "Content": "Thanks for the feedback. It's very much appreciated. I know docs will tell you not to go on Google because you'll drive yourself crazy, but of course that's exactly what I'm doing. Everything I've read says that although 2.5 is considered the upper limit for 40-49 yr olds, anything above 0.7 is suspicious. I'm no expert, so I don't know how accurate that information is. It's also difficult getting any info regarding having a low free PSA ratio when your total is under 2.5. Another concern is that if the higher PSA was due to BPH, shouldn't my free ratio be much higher? I did have sex the day before, and sit at my desk 8 hours a day. That said, it seems that those have a minimal impact on the PSA number. Do these tests vary often, and are the results occasionally inaccurate depending on the lab? I guess these are questions the urologist will answer, but I'm just concerned. Thanks again.",

I'm a hypochondriac so it's been difficult to sleep after getting my latest blood test back. My PSA was 0.8 in 2012, but has jumped to up to 2. Not only that but my Free PSA ratio was only 10.15. I read that the Free ratio only applies of your PSA is at least 4 but this is concerning. My doctor didn't seem concerned at all and said it could be from sex the day before, sitting at my desk all day, lab error, BPH, etc.. I have had odd symptoms for the last couple years on and off. Increased urgency to urinate, dribbling, increased frequency at times. I was wondering if anyone could help shed light on this for me as I'm a wreck. Made an appt to see urologist next week.",
