      "Content": "Hello, Good evening. Thanks for a very informative forum. I have been on Trimix for about 5 years, and started experiencing diminishing returns since January this year. My uro has increased my dose from standard all the way to Trimix 50... I met my Uro yesterday and it looks as if I am gearing towards the final frontier (implants). But before the final decision on this, we agreed that we give the injections a try - along with rings. We are considering a Quad-Mix strength of: QuadMix:[/b] Papaverine=30mg/mL; Phentolamine Mesylate=2mg/mL; Prostoglandin E1=20mcg/mL; Forskolin=100mcg/mL But given that I have already been on a stronger version of TriMix ( Papaverine = 30mg/mL; Phentolamine Mesylate = 1mg/mL; Prostoglandin E1 = 50mcg/mL), consisting of a PGE1 of 50mcg/ml, my question is: 1. Would the Quad-Mix be of any help since it contains a weaker Prostaglandin ingredient (of 20mcg)? 2. Would it be better to move to one more stronger version of Trimix - the one containing 80mcg of PGE1? Thanks - PS",

      "Content": "Thanks very much for your responses. I am 50 yrs. Cialis and Viagra no longer works, but Levitra works. And I do get about 70% erection response - this helps get the injection hit the target. But then the Trimix seems to flush out immediately. So before going under the knife, I want to d the following: 1. increase my cardio (i remember when the Trimix used to work well, I used to be more active -- at least exercising about three times per week) - hopefully this will help increase blood flow. 2. try adjustable rings after the injection to help retain the mix before it flushes out.... Any experience with any of these approaches ? Thanks - PS",
