      "Content": "My understanding is that they can't detect microscopic levels that MAY have escaped the prostate. I asked my Dr. this exact question. By taking the PSA post surgery, if the cancer is completely gone, your PSA will remain undetectable. If by some chance, a microscopic amount had escaped and or wasn't removed, and it adhered and started to grow in some other tissue, then gradually, your PSA would rise (very slowly) and secondary treatment would be necessary. I'm in the same boat. My 6-week post was \"undetectable\". My next is December 1st with the results on the 8th. Here's to undetectable!",

      "Content": "I just want to take a moment and thank each of you. As a stage III melanoma survivor and now a prostate cancer survivor, I often take a moment and read some of the other cancer forums. Tonight, I read through the melanoma and pancreatic cancer forums and it made me very sad. I had the fear 8 years ago when my nodular melanoma prognosis wasn't too pretty. It was re-staged on second opinion and I opted out of any further treatment other than a nice 10\" scar from the WAE and SNB. It'll be 9 years NED in May. Just taking some time and reading makes me realize how very fortunate and thankful I am. I'd rather not be here but I know it could be so much worse. Thank you all for the community, support, and advise. God bless you all. Fred",

In 2009, my PSA was described as normal but they never gave me a number. The DRE was considered normal for my age then. This past December, my PSA was 4.34 and my DRE was still considered normal. The urologist asked me to come back in March. I've just received my latest PSA, 4.32. The urologist recommended that I have a biopsy. I am scheduled for another Dr appointment in June and I thought I'd wait till then for yet another PSA. I have no adverse symptoms. My wife-unit is all over me to get the biopsy as I am a melanoma survivor (8 years post) and she wants me to be tested. As I'm sure most of you know, us 'new' guys aren't real keen to the tests. So, am I being stupid to want to wait a little longer for a biopsy? Even if the next one is within normal range, should I have one anyway? Damn it there is just so much conflicting information.

      "Content": "Well boys, I'm home. The surgery went well as far as I know. The wife-unit talked to the doctor and he said it was text book. The nerves easily came loose from the prostate. He took 4 lymph nodes and said they look normal but of course, they won't know until the lab reports come in. He said he'd call me today sometime. I did stay the night in the hospital and at first, I didn't want to. Out of surgery, of course, I was in a pretty good fog and relatively pain free. I normally come out of general anesthesia pretty good and yesterday was no different. However about 6 hours post-op, I began to feel nauseated; just slightly. They gave my IV something for that and I was fine. I didn't drink much at first and they told me they wanted clear urine before they'd let me go. I remember the Dr. saying that it would be different shades of red for up to three weeks so I thought the staff was encouraging me to drink. So I did. I did find out that it was best to sip it rather than gulp it. I tried just drinking it normally and it didn't sit too well on my stomach; but I could lay back and and feel normal after a 10 minutes or so. The pain from the 5 incisions aren't too bad. I'd say on a scale of 1 to 10 would be around a 3. Feels like the day after doing too many sit-ups. Not too bad. I'm not taking any pain meds however I do have them just in case. As an Air Traffic Controller, I don't take anything without seeing the flight surgeon so just not in the habit. This way too, I'll be better tuned to how I feel. I hadn't had anything to eat the day before except for clear liquids. I think 30 hours later with no solid food may have been part of the reason I felt nauseated. I ate a little and let it settle and gradually began feeling normal. I looked at the catheter and it was MUCH bigger than I expected. Really odd looking at it coming out of Mr. Johnson; so I didn't look. As for any pain or discomfort, none. I can sit or lie and not even notice. An added benefit is that I don't have to get up to pee. So here I am sitting in my home with the lovely wife-unit. I've been here about 30 minutes, pet the cats, and I'm at the kitchen table typing to you boys. Later today, when the doctor calls with the lab report, I'll fill y'all in. Thats about it. Thanks for this site and your support. Fred",

      "Content": "Well boys, I'm home. The surgery went well as far as I know. The wife-unit talked to the doctor and he said it was text book. The nerves easily came loose from the prostate. He took 4 lymph nodes and said they look normal but of course, they won't know until the lab reports come in. He said he'd call me today sometime. I did stay the night in the hospital and at first, I didn't want to. Out of surgery, of course, I was in a pretty good fog and relatively pain free. I normally come out of general anesthesia pretty good and yesterday was no different. However about 6 hours post-op, I began to feel nauseated; just slightly. They gave my IV something for that and I was fine. I didn't drink much at first and they told me they wanted clear urine before they'd let me go. I remember the Dr. saying that it would be different shades of red for up to three weeks so I thought the staff was encouraging me to drink. So I did. I did find out that it was best to sip it rather than gulp it. I tried just drinking it normally and it didn't sit too well on my stomach; but I could lay back and and feel normal after a 10 minutes or so. The pain from the 5 incisions aren't too bad. I'd say on a scale of 1 to 10 would be around a 3. Feels like the day after doing too many sit-ups. Not too bad. I'm not taking any pain meds however I do have them just in case. As an Air Traffic Controller, I don't take anything without seeing the flight surgeon so just not in the habit. This way too, I'll be better tuned to how I feel. I hadn't had anything to eat the day before except for clear liquids. I think 30 hours later with no solid food may have been part of the reason I felt nauseated. I ate a little and let it settle and gradually began feeling normal. I looked at the catheter and it was MUCH bigger than I expected. Really odd looking at it coming out of Mr. Johnson; so I didn't look. As for any pain or discomfort, none. I can sit or lie and not even notice. An added benefit is that I don't have to get up to pee. So here I am sitting in my home with the lovely wife-unit. I've been here about 30 minutes, pet the cats, and I'm at the kitchen table typing to you boys. Later today, when the doctor calls with the lab report, I'll fill y'all in. Thats about it.

      "Content": "Well, I posted this morning (or at least I thought I did) and it's not here. Maybe I hit cancel instead of post... anyway... I got home this morning about 10am. The surgery went smooth at 720am yesterday. I was intent on going home yesterday but was a little woozy and nauseated yesterday afternoon. The wife-unit decided for me that I would spend the night. All-in-all, I feel pretty good. I have a catheter in and it MUCH larger than I expected but not as uncomfortable as I thought it would be. My stomach is sore like I did too many sit-ups yesterday. I am able to get up and walk around without much discomfort. I've only taken ibuprofen (800mg) and then only once. I'd put the pain level about a 3 out of 10. The doctor told my wife-unit that the surgery was 'textbook'; which I guess is good. The nerves separated from the prostate easily and there didn't seem to be anything out of what he expected. I'm supposed to get a phone call this evening with the final results of the lab work so I'll let you all know what they are. Thanks again for your support. The journey continues.",

I did leak some at first but I was always near the bathroom and able to pee but always tried to hold as much as possible. I was pad free in two weeks during the day and Depends free 90 days out from surgery at night. Never looked back. I don't ever remember the doctor telling me anything about not drinking coffee.",

My thinking was that I wanted my bladder to feel as full as possible and get those signals re-fireing so-to-speak to the brain telling me to hold it. I did leak some at first but I was always near the bathroom and able to pee but always tried to hold as much as possible. I was pad free in two weeks during the day and Depends free 90 days out from surgery at night. Never looked back. I don't ever remember the doctor telling me anything about not drinking coffee.",

Everything works, nothing leaks, and my PSA yesterday was < .01. My Dr. said we go to every 6 months now to check PSA and I couldn't be happier. I don't even give it a thought anymore. Funny thing though, I do have dreams that I'm peeing occasionally. I wake up and am dry as a bone (no pun intended) and I get up and pee. This may happen once a month or so. That too will probably fade as time presses on. Good luck to everyone starting their journey. God speed. Fred",

      "Content": "First of all, thanks to all of you who recommended a biopsy. The wife-unit was on my ass to not mess around. Short history... Previous physical at 49 (9-2013) and DRE 'normal for my age' and PSA normal. (no number given) Wife had to hammer me to even get a physical; I'm a guy right? Fast forward to my next physical at 53 (12-2013): Normal DRE and PSA 4.34. Doc said it was a little high and wanted me to go to a urologist. Crap. Went to Urologist in Jan 2014 and doctor wanted to see me in March for another PSA and explained numerous reasons it could be high. Good I thought. It must be one of those. March 2014, PSA 4.32 and doctor said he wanted me to have a biopsy. Well that crap wasn't gonna fly with me. I mean nobody was gonna shove that thing up there and poke me with... well you know... So.... I found y'all... and wrote for information. Thanks to all who responded and encouraged me. I got the biopsy... but.... THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GONNA BE ANYWHERE NEAR LUCID for that test! So I found a surgeon who had over 1000 Da Vinci surgeries and got rave reviews here in my town (Knoxville, TN) who was willing to give me something similar to the colonoscopy meds for my biopsy. May 23rd. It was cool. Today I got my results. I have prostate cancer. There, I said it. But on the bright side, he said we caught it very early. Since my Dr. put me out, he told me he took advantage of me by taking 27 cores! He explained them to me and I have a little chart but not too sure what it all means; but he said it's the best possible bad news. Here it is.. Site, Length, Diagnosis, Score, % Left Lateral Base: 1.6 x 2 Andenocarcinoma 3+3=6 10% Left Base 1.5 x 2 Benign Right Base 1.7, 1.4 High Grade PIN Right Lateral Base 1.3, 1.2 Andenocarcinoma 3+3=6 5% Left Lateral Mid 1.6,1.5 Benign Left Mid 2.0, 1.2 Andenocarcinoma 3+3=6 10% Right Mid 2.0, 1.2 Benign Right Lateral Mid 1.7, 1.4 Andenocarcinoma 3+3=6 2% Left Lateral Apex 1.6, 1.4 Benign Left Apex 1.7, 1.5, 0.7 Benign Right Apex 1.6, 1.5 Benign Right Lateral Apex 1.6, 1.3 Benign Transition Zone 1.7, 1.3 Benign So he kinda explained what it all meant but I was a little numb. He said we caught it early and I should have a 90% chance of living a real long time. My surgery will be scheduled next week. The Doc wanted to wait 6 weeks for the prostate to calm down after the biopsy. I did bleed for about 8 days. I should be having my surgery in the second or third week in July. Any thoughts? Fred",

A little sore (3 out of 10). I too read that study about the vasectomy leading to higher chance and severity of PC and I asked my surgeon about it.

      "Content": "First of all, thanks to all of you who recommended a biopsy. The wife-unit was on my ass to not mess around. Short history... Previous physical at 49 (9-2013) and DRE 'normal for my age' and PSA normal. (no number given) Wife had to hammer me to even get a physical; I'm a guy right? Fast forward to my next physical at 53 (12-2013): Normal DRE and PSA 4.34. Doc said it was a little high and wanted me to go to a urologist. Crap. Went to Urologist in Jan 2014 and doctor wanted to see me in March for another PSA and explained numerous reasons it could be high. Good I thought. It must be one of those. March 2014, PSA 4.32 and doctor said he wanted me to have a biopsy. Well that crap wasn't gonna fly with me. I mean nobody was gonna shove that thing up there and poke me with... well you know... So.... I found y'all... and wrote for information. Thanks to all who responded and encouraged me. I got the biopsy... but.... THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GONNA BE ANYWHERE NEAR LUCID for that test! So I found a surgeon who had over 1000 Da Vinci surgeries and got rave reviews here in my town (Knoxville, TN) who was willing to give me something similar to the colonoscopy meds for my biopsy. May 23rd. It was cool. Today I got my results. I have prostate cancer. There, I said it. But on the bright side, he said we caught it very early. Since my Dr. put me out, he told me he took advantage of me by taking 27 cores! He explained them to me and I have a little chart but not too sure what it all means; but he said it's the best possible bad news. Here it is.. Site, Length, Diagnosis, Score, % Left Lateral Base: 1.6 x 2 Andenocarcinoma 3+3=6 10% Left Base 1.5 x 2 Benign Right Base 1.7, 1.4 High Grade PIN Right Lateral Base 1.3, 1.2 Andenocarcinoma 3+3=6 5% Left Lateral Mid 1.6,1.5 Benign Left Mid 2.0, 1.2 Andenocarcinoma 3+3=6 10% Right Mid 2.0, 1.2 Benign Right Lateral Mid 1.7, 1.4 Andenocarcinoma 3+3=6 2% Left Lateral Apex 1.6, 1.4 Benign Left Apex 1.7, 1.5, 0.7 Benign Right Apex 1.6, 1.5 Benign Right Lateral Apex 1.6, 1.3 Benign Transition Zone 1.7, 1.3 Benign So he kinda explained what it all meant but I was a little numb. He said we caught it early and I should have a 90% chance of living a real long time. My surgery will be scheduled next week. The Doc wanted to wait 6 weeks for the prostate to calm down after the biopsy. I did bleed for about 8 days. I should be having my surgery in the second or third week in July. Any thoughts? Fred",

      "Content": "First of all, thanks to all of you who recommended a biopsy. The wife-unit was on my ass to not mess around. Short history... Previous physical at 49 (9-2013) and DRE 'normal for my age' and PSA normal. (no number given) Wife had to hammer me to even get a physical; I'm a guy right? Fast forward to my next physical at 53 (12-2013): Normal DRE and PSA 4.34. Doc said it was a little high and wanted me to go to a urologist. Crap. Went to Urologist in Jan 2014 and doctor wanted to see me in March for another PSA and explained numerous reasons it could be high. Good I thought. It must be one of those. March 2014, PSA 4.32 and doctor said he wanted me to have a biopsy. Well that crap wasn't gonna fly with me. I mean nobody was gonna shove that thing up there and poke me with... well you know... So.... I found y'all... and wrote for information. Thanks to all who responded and encouraged me. I got the biopsy... but.... THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GONNA BE ANYWHERE NEAR LUCID for that test! So I found a surgeon who had over 1000 Da Vinci surgeries and got rave reviews here in my town (Knoxville, TN) who was willing to give me something similar to the colonoscopy meds for my biopsy. May 23rd. It was cool. Today I got my results. I have prostate cancer. There, I said it. But on the bright side, he said we caught it very early. Since my Dr. put me out, he told me he took advantage of me by taking 27 cores! He explained them to me and I have a little chart but not too sure what it all means; but he said it's the best possible bad news. Here it is.. Site, Length, Diagnosis, Score, % Left Lateral Base: 1.6 x 2 Andenocarcinoma 3+3=6 10% Left Base 1.5 x 2 Benign Right Base 1.7, 1.4 High Grade PIN Right Lateral Base 1.3, 1.2 Andenocarcinoma 3+3=6 5% Left Lateral Mid 1.6,1.5 Benign Left Mid 2.0, 1.2 Andenocarcinoma 3+3=6 10% Right Mid 2.0, 1.2 Benign Right Lateral Mid 1.7, 1.4 Andenocarcinoma 3+3=6 2% Left Lateral Apex 1.6, 1.4 Benign Left Apex 1.7, 1.5, 0.7 Benign Right Apex 1.6, 1.5 Benign Right Lateral Apex 1.6, 1.3 Benign Transition Zone 1.7, 1.3 Benign So he kinda explained what it all meant but I was a little numb. He said we caught it early and I should have a 90% chance of living a real long time. My surgery will be scheduled next week. The Doc wanted to wait 6 weeks for the prostate to calm down after the biopsy. I did bleed for about 8 days. I should be having my surgery in the second or third week in July. Any thoughts? Fred",

      "Content": "Thanks Guys for all the comments and advice. As a melanoma survivor (WAE and 5 lymph nodes removed, all clear, 8 years NED) I had mentally prepared myself for the diagnosis and have been researching the alternatives. Fortunately for me, I have a very supportive wife-unit who is in the medical field and is all over this. She's found the best surgeons from all her doctor circles and what have you. I have been left to research her findings. I don't have any children so she is my life and I intend on being around a long time to spend it with her. My father was the first male in 5 generations that lived past 56 and he died in 2003 from what I called body cancer. Something, metastasized everywhere else and eventually, sadly too early, got him. I swear I'm gonna break this pattern. I just want it out and get on with living life. I understand there may be a new normal; so are aches and pains. I have always been in good shape, I run 4x a week and eat healthy. Hopefully, I'll be some sort of inspiration to anyone else starting their journey. I, with your help, will beat this. Again, thanks for your support. Fred",

You'll need someone to be able to drive you as you'll not be able to drive for the first week while you have the catheter.

Everything works as it should with no incontinence. Do as everyone previously advises and you will be fine. As far as taking care of yourself, I think that's certainly doable. My wife was here for moral support for the first two days but I was solo after that. I actually didn't mind much the catheter. It was odd of course but not nearly as bad as I initially thought. I was able to shower, dress, walk, eat, take a crap () and anything else. Just couldn't lift anything that could cause any abdominal strain.

You'll need someone to be able to drive you as you'll not be able to drive for the first week while you have the catheter. I was able to return to work in 10 days but no physical activity for 6 weeks. After that, no restrictions. My outcome was very superior and I have no regrets. Everything works as it should with no incontinence. Do as everyone previously advises and you will be fine. As far as taking care of yourself, I think that's certainly doable. My wife was here for moral support for the first two days but I was solo after that. I actually didn't mind much the catheter. It was odd of course but not nearly as bad as I initially thought. I was able to shower, dress, walk, eat, take a crap () and anything else. Just couldn't lift anything that could cause any abdominal strain. I sat and played PS4 and killed a few kids in Call of Duty. You'll have to have someone drive you to take the cath out as well. Here's to a good result. Fred",
