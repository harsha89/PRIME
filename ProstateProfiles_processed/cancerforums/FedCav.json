Which of my vehicle choices would be the easiest for me to come home in? 2015 Mazda 3 This is my wife's car and the one she'd prefer to drive. I have to sit low and back in, then swing my legs around to get in. 2005 Ford F250 Lariat Diesel My truck. I would have to step up on the running board then another step up to get into the cab. My wife hasn't driven it and it intimidates her but it has adjustable peddles and seats so she could drive it. 2006 PT Cruiser My son's car. Similar to my wife's car, but not as low to get into. So would it be easier to squat or step up after surgery? Thanks in advance- Gary",

The other side has 4 cores, some at 95%, which I assumed was why he didn't want to spare those. I've been reading that a few guys here had nerve sparing surgeries with all 12 cores showing positive, which now makes me question what the criteria might be in determining whether to remove or leave a nerve bundle behind. Can anyone weigh in on this? Thanks, Gary",

      "Content": "So we met with Dr. Hettinger, our first possible surgeon yesterday. He is the younger and less experienced of the two that we decided to meet, having done \"hundreds\" as opposed to Dr. Emmott that is my age (61) and has done over 1000. Both happen to be with the same urology group as Dr. Bock, the urologist that did my biopsies. Besides age and experience, they seem to disagree on the use of the Rocco stitch on the bladder. Dr. Hettinger said he doesn't think it's necessary as he has had the same continence success without it and avoids stitching into healthy tissue or organs whenever possible. He said that there is a remote chance the bladder could actually rupture which really sounds no bueno. We meet with Dr. Emmott tomorrow and we'll go over why he uses it, but I would love to hear input from you guys first, if possible. Meanwhile- My beautiful and incredibly supportive wife (52) now has to have her uterus biopsied next week because of some raised suspicions and just to keep things interesting, we learned this morning that her mammogram shows calcium grains which could possibly be yet another early warning sign of cancer. I beginning to wonder if our house was built over native burial grounds or a toxic dump. God, if you really feel the need to smack someone, please consider ISIS. They like martyrdom. Gary",

      "Content": "Thank you guys. Knowledge is power. My wife has already printed out the \"Questions to Ask My Doctor\" form from the American Cancer Society website and has networked the name of a recommended oncologist for another opinion. My urologist did a good job on my vasectomy 5 years ago but I know this is a different ball game (rimshot!). I'm not far from the University of Kansas (KU) Medical Center. I'll have to check them out as well. I read on another thread where someone recommended getting a second pathology opinion from John Hopkins. Would my lab have kept the 12 samples to be able to do this? Is it even necessary given my lab results? Wilde- You had your surgery rather quickly, with what seems to me a better lab result than I got. How did that go? Our appointment is for 11:15 this morning. We'll see what he says. Gary",

      "Content": "Hello from Kansas City. Wow. I am still in a bit of shock and my brain is trying to process everything I've been reading since being diagnosed with PC last Thursday. It's an unwanted early birthday present as I will turn 61 on 1/31. I'm sure I'll have questions to post later, but first I wanted to introduce myself and post what I know as of now. There has been no known history of prostate cancer in my family. That could be because most died young (under 70) of other cancers, mostly lung. My dad was 59. I grew up athletic and I've stayed pretty active. I do reenacting as a captain of a Union civil war cavalry company hence the \"FedCav\". My DRE was normal but my PSA came back 4.1 last November. Two weeks later it was 4.8 so to \"play it safe\" a biopsy was scheduled for 1/16. it came back as 4+3=7 with cancer in both halves of the prostate and a perineural invasion present. My wife (together since 1984 and still going strong) and I are having our first \"treatment options\" meeting with my urologist tomorrow. Here are my lab results: Right medial base: ￼￼￼- Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+3=6 involving 75% of core. 2. Right medial mid: - Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+3=6 involving 95% of core. 3. Right medial apex - Focal atypical small acinar proliferation. 4. Right lateral base: - Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+4=7 involving 95% of core. - Perineural invasion present. 5. Right lateral mid: - Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+3=6 involving 20% of core. 6. Right lateral apex: - Benign prostate tissue 7. Left medial base: - Benign prostate tissue. 8. Left medial mid: - Benign prostate tissue. 9. Left medial apex: - Benign prostate tissue. 10. Left lateral base: - High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. 11. Left lateral mid: - High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. 12. Left lateral apex: - Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+3=7 involving 10% of core. Well, here I am. I'll report back after our meeting tomorrow. Thanks for being here. Gary",

      "Content": "We met with the radiologist today and she too recommends surgery, because of my age (61) and general good health. Should the surgery not get it all, which is unlikely, then we can do radiation. Although I am a good candidate for either, they say surgery after radiation is very difficult and not too many doctors attempt it. Kind of a no brainer, then. We are going with Dr. David F. Emmott. He is the older surgeon (61) of the two we met, with the thousand plus daVinci surgeries under his belt. His explanation of why he does the Rocco stitch made sense. He said I was the first patient to ever ask him about the Rocco stitch, which is a credit to the information available on this site. He only schedules himself for one surgery a day, which is great. He was very sincere, pleasant and brutally honest about my somewhat slim chances of getting natural erections. He will not spare the nerves on the right side as he feels there is too much risk in leaving some cancer behind. He will try to spare the left side nerves, however. Better limp in life than stiff in death, right? For those who are following along, my wife is getting her uterus biopsied on Monday and her breasts biopsied on Tuesday. Positive thoughts that both her pathology reports come back negative are appreciated. Hell of a week we've had. Gary",

      "Content": "We met with the radiologist today and she too recommends surgery, because of my age (61) and general good health. Should the surgery not get it all, which is unlikely, then we can do radiation. Although I am a good candidate for either, they say surgery after radiation is very difficult and not too many doctors attempt it. Kind of a no brainer, then. We are going with Dr. David F. Emmott. He is the older surgeon (61) of the two we met, with the thousand plus daVinci surgeries under his belt. His explanation of why he does the Rocco stitch made sense. He said I was the first patient to ever ask him about the Rocco stitch, which is a credit to the information available on this site. He only schedules himself for one surgery a day, which is great. He was very sincere, pleasant and brutally honest about my somewhat slim chances of getting natural erections. He will not spare the nerves on the right side as he feels there is too much risk in leaving some cancer behind. He will try to spare the left side nerves, however. Better limp in life than stiff in death, right? For those who are following along, my wife is getting her uterus biopsied on Monday and her breasts biopsied on Tuesday. Positive thoughts that both her pathology reports come back negative are appreciated. Hell of a week we've had. Gary",
