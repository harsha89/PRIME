      "Content": "I am a 47 year old man with a strong family history of prostate cancer. I have been getting yearly exams at a urologist with PSA. PSA 2011 0.8, 2014 1.1, 2015 1.25. Last week he said he felt a soft nodule on my prostate and I am having a biopsy tomorrow. He told me that a soft nodule was good and my PSA was low so he optimistic. I've done nothing but cry for 4 days. Every time I shoot basketball with my kids or even in the same room I leave and go to my shop and cry. Is it possible that the soft nodule is just the start of BPH and maybe nothing serious? Thanks",

My father and two uncles had PC so it makes me very nervous. It is good advice to take one step at a time. I hope I can sleep tonight. I believe the urologist said he is taking 6 samples tomorrow. If it is nothing what would cause a soft nodule? Thanks for listening",
