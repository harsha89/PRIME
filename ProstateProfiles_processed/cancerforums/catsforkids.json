We are set to see an oncologist and radiation oncologist after a PSA redraw in 3 weeks. Casodex was stopped. Has anyone been in a similar situation and the withdrawal of Casodex helped lower the PSA? How bad are the side effects with radiation? I would sure appreciate any thoughts or comments on the position my dad is in. And if anyone has been \"here\" and can give insights as to what to expect. Thanks so much. We are in unchartered territory now.",
