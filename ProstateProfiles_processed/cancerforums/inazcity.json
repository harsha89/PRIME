      "Content": "Thank you for your help. The Urologist that I am using is the head of the urological dept at University of Arizona. Along the way I had a PCA3 test and was told that it was OK. If it were an infection, I do not understand how it could possibly be ever increasing. Immediate family history includes a father that died of colon/rectal cancer, Mother and 2 uncles Pancreatic cancer and my older brother had his prostate removed due to cancer. Since I have never been 57 before I do not know what symptoms are age related and which are not. I have a small amount of leakage after urination -3 drops? No problem or pain urinating, sexually everything works when it should maybe not with the stiff upper lip of my younger days. That is about all the info I have. I was looking for any stats on what % of people with PSAof 21 actually have cancer but of course no info that I could find. If anyone knows where to find the stats I would appreciate it (maybe) Again, Thank You all",

      "Content": "Trying to find out if others have experienced this. 4 years ago I had a PSA of 3 and had a biopsy with all 32 samples clean. After a year I had another PSA done and was at 6. No Biopsy done since 1st one was clean. 3rd year PSA of 13 another biopsy again 32 samples and all clean. Just got this years results of a whopping 21. Does anyone have any idea of what could possibly cause this. Prostate has been slightly enlarged since the first time and have done the antibiotic regiment to no avail. Just looking for answers. Any help or ideas will be appreciated",
