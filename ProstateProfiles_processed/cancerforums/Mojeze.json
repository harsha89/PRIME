He has been seeing an oncologist at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and they are recommending SHARP (Stereotactic Hypofractionated Accelerated Radiation Therapy). It sounds good with only 5 radiation treatments instead of the 40-45 with other treatments. His appointment to have the markers inserted is in November and I was looking for anyone who has gone through this before. I can't find much info on it searching the internet. I would like to hear experiences from other people.",
