      "Content": "Yes - sorry, I have it all here to post again - not sure what happened there! Hi I'm new here, this is my first post, and wondering if anyone can offer any support/advice/own experiences? I have quite a lot to write but will try not to bore and keep to the facts. My Dad was diagnosed with PC early in 2004 at 52 years old. He had been suffering with what his GP thought was a UTi for 6 months when his PSA was taken and came back at 22ng. All 8 biopsies of the prostate were cancerous and scans showed that the cancer had broken out of the capsule but not yet reached the lymph or bone. He was Gleason 7, and his Urologist thinks the cancer had probably been growing for around 15 years (so since his late 30's). He had 6 weeks of radiotherapy and then put onto Casodex. For sometime this drug worked well alone, but after around 7 years he was put onto a monthly Zolodex implant also. His monthly PSA levels were around and average of 0.04ng for sometime. Late in 2013, his PSA started rising very slowly again and his Urologist referred him to an Oncologist as he felt that they were starting to lose control of the cancer, and he himself had done his part so the next step was for Oncology to make. His oncologist re-scanned him, there was no changes, so took him off of Casodex and told him to continue with Zolodex only as the cancer had become resistant to the Casodex. Slowly, but from this point on, he started having urinary symptoms, needing to urinate constantly but virtually nothing coming out when he did. I think I recall one bladder flow test showing that only 18% of the bladder was being emptied each time. He saw his urologist again and eventually had a TURP in June 2014. His Urologist said it was actually 'touch and go' as to whether he needed to open him up as he could barely get his instruments through the uretha due to being nearly at the point of retention. From June to Sept he regained most of the control of the bladder that the surgery had disrupted, and other than needing to wee a bit more often than a normal person, he was much better than pre-TURP. He did bleed a lot when urinating though, and if he strained his bowel he would then end up with a blood clot in the bladder that stopped the urine flow until it passed. He also started having sharp pains at the end of urination. Eventually I told him to see the GP as he felt something wasn't right - since Sept he has had 20 lots of antibiotics for UTI's. At one point, in Dec, he had to take himself off to A&E in the early hours as he couldn't wee at all, and he was fitted with a temporary catheter. A huge blood clot, the size of a small piece of liver, was blocking the exit which was causing retention. It came away by itself but his urologist scheduled him in for another small op on 23rd Dec as he said it was the tumour that was bleeding and needed to be cauterised. It was at this pre-op check that the nurses noted he had lost 1 stone (14lbs) in weight since his pre-op in June. Unusual, for a guy that hasn't lost weight in over 20 years, and no chance since starting HT. Myself, husband and 4 kids had taken Mum and Dad on a big all inclusive cruise in late August for a fortnight, and my Mum had to buy new larger size clothes for him then (where he ate and drank as one would), so the weight loss had to have been from Sept onwards. The op on 23rd Dec was successful, tumour was cauterised, all looked fine in there, and since then no more bleeding, however......... His appetite is poor and has been for a couple of months now, he gets full quickly. He no longer enjoys alcohol. He's very tired, he's very pale, he's lost more weight, he's now anaemic - he looks like a very poorly man but is putting on an exceptionally brave face. Last week he visited his Oncologist, the first time since ceasing Casodex in late 2013. He had kept in contact with him via telephone an email, but as the oncologist had said, there was no point in keep seeing each other when there was nothing to treat - PSA had been low, he had no other symptoms or problems, so they kept in touch remotely. I went with him to the appointment, I've never been before, and Dad told him about the TURP/bleeding issues which had now been resolved, but more importantly, how he hadn't been feeling too well. We were in there a while, but In a nutshell, his oncologist asked him to get a whole host of bloods done, has organised a bone and CT scan, and basically said that he thinks the cancer is now active and that he needs to 're-stage' him. Dad had the bloods done the following morning (23rd) and got the results on 28th (my birthday). He scanned a copy to me before sending to his oncologist. His PSA is 123ng - it wasn't even a quarter of this when diagnosed and pre-HT. Not only that, he is even more aneamic, even though on iron for 8+ weeks, his CRP (inflammation marker) is really high, and his Liver Function Tests are very abnormal. So, from what I can see from researching, it seems he would maybe now have 'hormone refractory PC', unless there are many other Hormone Therapy drugs to try? Does anyone know or have experience of what the next treatment may be? When the Oncologist said 'active' (which looks like be was spot on due to the PSA) does this mean the cancer has spread or not necessarily? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",
