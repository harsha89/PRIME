      "Content": "During a turp operation in February 2011 the doctor took 13 biopsies, one of which turned out to be malignant. On the advice of an Oncologist I adopted a wait and watch plan. The 2011 PSA in May was 2.4, August 3.4, November 4.8. February 2012 my PSA was 4.7, April 4.9, August 7.7, September 6.4. February 2013 PSA was 5.5 and in August 2013 it was 6.1. February 2014 the PSA was 8.0, September 10.5, October 12.5 and November 15.5. Pet scan in September showed radiotracer uptake in the right ischial tuberosity posteriorly which is a new 6 mm sclerotic lesion, likely an early osseous metastasis. Urologist wants to start hormone treatment with two shots of firmagon then lupron. Oncologist at Mayo wants to do C11 Choline scan, local Oncologist wants to wait until January 2015 then repeat the pet scan. I have read several articles about the C11, most of which say it was designed for those who have had treatment and the cancer has come back. I have received no treatment or medication for the prostate cancer. I am concerned about the C11 and if it is beneficial in my case. Would appreciate your comments and suggestions.",

      "Content": "There were 13 samples submitted for pathology. The 12 from the Base, Mid, and Apex were all benign. The prostatic adenocarcinoma was detected in 3 of the 25 prostatic chips from prostate tissue. I am now working with a cancer specialist Oncologist. While my PSA is going up he thinks Active Survieillance is still the best approach. The size of the lesion (6 mm) and the pathologist statement that it is \"LIKELY an early osseous metastasis\" are factors in this decision. We should know more after the January Pet scan plus what we will learn from the scan at Mayo.",

      "Content": "Thanks Highlander for the response. The Gleason score for the one biopsy from the Turp was 3 + 3 = 6. The Oncologist that I saw after the Turp said it was of the very slow growing type and he stressed wait and watch. He was a radiation specialist and recommended observation rather than radiation. Between my primary physcian and urologist the PSA has been checked quite frequently. I have a lot of faith in Mayo also, just not sure about this scan.",
