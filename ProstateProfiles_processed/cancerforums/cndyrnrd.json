      "Content": "Hello all. My 74 year old dad has just been diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastasized Prostate Cancer. He was always anti-doctors in the past, so he never went to get regular checkups or get a colonoscopy. My parents went to Mexico and when he came back, he got strep throat. My mom took him to the doc to get meds and the doc noticed his ankles were swollen. Doc ordered blood work - this was a Tuesday. By Friday that same week, the doc called my dad and told him his red blood count was at 5 - so low that he could risk a heart attack. He was told to go in ASAP to get a blood transfusion. By the next week we found out his PSA was over 500 - yes, 500. A CAT was done and a prostate biopsy was on the calendar for the next week. A bone marrow biopsy was ordered as well before the prostate biopsy. 2 days after the marrow biopsy, the prostate biopsy was cancelled. No radiation or chemo or surgery at this point. The doc has started him on some hormone therapy. Shots into his stomach area once a month, as well as a \"bone\" shot. The doc has given him 3-5 years. Gleason score is 10. Just because my parents dont ask alot of things that I think are necessary, my dad is letting me come to his next appointment with him on May 30th. Are the hormone shots supposed to help the cancer growth? Or is this something to just make him more comfortable. What questions should I ask the doc when I go? He complains of bad leg pain - says its his sciatic nerve. Or is it really his bones deteriorating? I dont think he tells me everything so I dont worry more - but I cant help but worry - he is my dad. Thank you to everyone in advance - you all seem to have alot of knowledge of cancer so any information is helpful to me.",
