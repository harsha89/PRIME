Pre-op CT abdo/pelvis = negative for metastasis Pre-op Bone scan twice = negative for bony metastasis He underwent open radical prostatectomy with sentinel lymph node removal urgently in Jan 2015. No adjuvant radiation as his pathology looked relatively encouraging. On prostate biopsy, his cancer was upgraded to T3a with extraprostatic invasion in right lobe with low tumor volume <10%, negative surgical margins, negative seminal vesicle involvement, negative bladder neck involvement, 1 right pelvic lymph node negative for malignancy, 3 left pelvic lymph node negative for malignancy. His post-op PSAs were: April 2015 PSA = 0.003 August 2015 PSA = 0.005 Oct 2015 PSA = 0.007 Jan 2016 PSA = 0.16 (done in middle east at a different lab from his usual labs) His most recent PSA has got me all panicked. I am in shock mode right now. My dad's PSA has jumped 23 times in 3 months only. I seek your experiences. Do you think it is remotely possible that this is lab error or poor lab test kit? According to Memorial Sloan Kettering nomogram, my dad had a 97% of recurrence free 2 years after surgery. This most recent PSA defies all that hope. It shatters all that hope I had slowly built after getting the diagnosis. Any thoughts? Depressed physician.",
