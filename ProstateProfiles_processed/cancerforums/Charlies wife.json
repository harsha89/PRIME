      "Content": "John 4803, hubby doing good. It was 3 weeks this past Tuesday since his surgery. He had his catheter removed a week after the surgery. He still has some swelling in the abdomen but it has went down considerably. His scrotum and penis are still swollen. They both go down some at night but go back up after he gets up. He reclines most of the time which helps some but according to him not enough! He did finally put some jeans on this week which he said did help as far as support but he still is in the waddling state when he walks. He has been outside walking more this week which I think helped some. After reading about everyone else having the same problems it helps relieve the anxiety which also helps. He said it it wasn\u2019t for the boys being three times their size he would be in great shape considering. He is also a pT3b, GS 9 with one positive lymph node. Incontinence is not bad. Dry at night and mostly during the day except when getting up, sneezing etc. Has already switched from wearing the guard pads to the lighter pad which I feel is pretty good. Go back for his first PSA and follow up since surgery on 1-3-18. Hoping for a good read but prepared for probable radiation treatments. How long did you have to have the catheter. How are you doing with treatments?",
