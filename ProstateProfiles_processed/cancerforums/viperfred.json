      "Content": "Originally Posted by RW744 I would greatly appreciate hearing about your experience with CyberKnife vs robotic surgery. I would like to go with CyberKnife but can't find much information about its long term curative rate, side effects and toxicity. I am 67, have a PSA of 5.58, clear bone and CT scans, an MRI showing four \"suspected tumors\" ranging from .4 to 1.3 cm with two of them in broad capsular contact but with no bulging, Gleason scores of three 6's and one 7 (3+4) and my father had pc. Have any of you used CyberKnife? Or is robotic surgery the way to go? If I do that procedure, my surgeon is one of the very best. What is your evaluation of CyberKnife? Thanks for sharing any of your experience or advice? The Cyberknife is the best treatment option for locxalized prostate cancer in my opinion. I was treated in May 2008 with the cyberknife and have Zero side effects and my PSA is 0.3 ng/ml. (before treatment it was 5.0 ng/ml). There are many woh are criticial of the Cyberknife. However look at the published peer reviewed studies now with five year published data. There is no recovery time, on surgical risk, no other treatment has a higher cure rate and no other treatment offers a better quality of life. The Cyberknife treatment is 4 or 5 sessions depending on the protocol. It is a form of external beam radiation. The radiation energy is photons, the dose per session is extreme hypo fractionation similiar to the dose from HDR Brachytherapy. This is a proven therapy, approved by the FDA in 2001. What makes the Cyberknife exceptional is delivery of radiation beams from three planes (x,y,z), gold fiducial targets are placed in the prostate for real time (target volume, prostate, is located before the beam is delivered) tracking. These two features allow sub mm accuracy of delivery of prescribed dose to the target volume. No ohter treatment can delivery the same accuracy. Read the published literature for each option and make an informed choice. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lancepeace No experience with either. Even with the best surgeon, ED and some degree of incontinence are possible with robotic surgery. The hospital stay is short followed by a week with a catheter. side effects vary. The pathologist can look at whole prostate. No symptoms of enlarged prostate afterward. Surgeon can examine area and margins. With CyberKnife more appointments. Small possible risk of radiation burns maybe. I'm guessing the surgery would risk more side effects. Good luck. Hi Lancepeace, Your comments of risk from surgery are general however published studies for open and robotic surgery show the risk which are high when compared to the risk from the Cyberknife or other modern radio therapy treatments. The comment about radiation burn risk from the Cyberknife is misinformation and without any factual basis. Read the published clinical studies regarding the Cyberknife and prostate cancer. Fred",

RW744, Reading your biopsy and diagnostic reports again, I see your cancer seemed to be pushing the edge (capsule), I would consult your doctor to see if that could be a risk factor for Cyberknife. A very precise beam is both good and bad. If the cancer is pushing the edge, there may be potential misses or damaging adjacent tissues (if the doctor is too aggressive with the beam coverage). Again, just a layperson's opinion which may or may not be correct. RWt44 is correct to ask doctors any and all questions that your have. Ask the Cyberknife RO questions about the CK and ask the surgeon surgical questions. CK Radiation is delivered by hundreds of beams from x,y, and z planes.
