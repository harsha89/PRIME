      "Content": "Finishing up 8 weeks of daily radition treatments for the metastized prostate cancer after haveing the prostate removed last Oct (2011). After two hormone shots (leuprolide acetate) and the 40 treatments the PSA is down to 0.02. Not zero yet. Scheule calls for another PSA in three months. Hormone shots caused hot flashes just line women, and they can be bad in the summer in Florida. Lost 22lbs during treatments and have no Appetite, require a nap every day for 45mins. Other wise feeling not bad. Information from DR. is wait and see if PSA goes to ZERO (0) or rises again. All are Optimistic as am I. Thanks to all who have replyed in the past.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter Bruce, Very encouraging results and hope your PSA stays down for a long time. For most of us, PSA came back <.1 or <.0x are considered undetectable and zero. Are you using an ultra sensitive test? The Dr have never said anthing about the sensitivity... I will ask next visit Monday. Local results from 'SunCoast Med' & St Anthony's Hospital have been consistant with readings to the 1/100 Thank you for the feed back8",
