I have to tighten up when standing from a sitting position, when sneezing, etc. or I will leak slightly. I usually walk 1-2 miles per day which seems to help. I usually drink 1 soda, 1 cup decaf coffee, 2 cups decaf green tea and several glasses of water every day.

      "Content": "My surgeon trained at the Vattikuti Institute and uses the double layer Rocco. At 6 weeks post op the stitching started disintegrating and coming out in the urine in very small specs. Initially this worried me however after a call to the doc and his explanation I understood. It took about 4 weeks for all of the double layer stitching to decay and come out. His explanation for using this stitch was it is the most \"fluid tight\". At 66 years of age, I've had very good success in regaining my continence. At 3 months post op my only problem is an occasional very small leak. If the stitching contributed to my regaining continence more quickly, thats great.",
