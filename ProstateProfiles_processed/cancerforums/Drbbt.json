      "Content": "Wanted to update you guys. Had RRP on Sep 14 and doing well. Post-op pathology indicated that tumor was confined to prostate, but it was upgraded to 3+4=7 and it was bilateral. I really wavered on surgery, but I'm glad it's gone. Catheter was tough on a big baby like me, but I'm doing very well with continence...far beyond my best expectations. The other department is Rip Van Winkle, unfortunately. Ironically, I have a strong desire to go after my wife of 20 years as if I were a teenager. I know it's (very) early, but I hope old Rip starts to wake up soon. I am fortunate to have a good support group around me, my workplace has been great, and I have been very pleased with my urologist and his staff. Real pros. I thank all of you vets here on this site also. I haven't posted a lot since discovering this forum, but I've read and learned a lot. God bless.",

In addition, Mr. Happy is beginning to cooperate with me, which is a relief. However, the little guy has a noticeable bend now (maybe 20°). I know this can sometimes be a side effect of injections, but (so far) I\u2019ve only used the little pill. My question is, has anyone experienced this and does it eventually get better?

      "Content": "Hello everyone. I'd like to say that I am happy to be here, but I will say that I am happy that this forum is here. This is my first post, but I've been helped immensely by what I have found here already. I found out that I have PCa on July 22nd, just 4 days before my 48th birthday. I was not new to urology as I began having occasional bouts of prostatitis back in my early 30s. My PSA had fluctuated a bit over the past 5 years, but had never gone above 2.5 and had always settled back down. Couple of years ago it climbed to 2.6 and created some anxiety for me. We retested and it dropped to 1.7. For the next year, I forgot that I even had a prostate. Then it shot up to 4.2 (!!!) a year later. Based my history of chronic prostatitis and years of fluctuations, my doctor recommended a round of antibiotics and a retest. 2 months later it was down to 3.2. He told me to come back in four months, but it was basically the same at 3.1. He recommended the biopsy (which was slightly uncomfortably in one lobe, but hurt like a mug in the other!). Results revealed 3/12 cores positive (all Gleason 6) with up to 30% of volume in the three cores. No evidence of PIN. I took the news like a champ, but slowly unraveled over the next few days. My uro has done hundreds of open prostatectomies and recommended surgery, although he took a couple of hours to explain all of my options to me and did not push anything. He said that I had some time and that I should carefully weigh my options. I have done my research and talked to other doctors, but believe surgery is my best course of action. I have been fortunate to have never had surgery in my life and I have some apprehension, but I also have a young family and I want the best shot that I can get. I am leaning on God and my always supportive wife and I am very grateful to have found this forum.",

My uro has done hundreds of open prostatectomies and recommended surgery, although he took a couple of hours to explain all of my options to me and did not push anything. He said that I had some time and that I should carefully weigh my options. I have done my research and talked to other doctors, but believe surgery is my best course of action. I have been fortunate to have never had surgery in my life and I have some apprehension, but I also have a young family and I want the best shot that I can get. I am leaning on God and my always supportive wife and I am very grateful to have found this forum.",

      "Content": "First PSA after RP today and it was <0.1. Man, that's a great looking number! Seven weeks out of surgery and peeing with a very good stream when I have a full bladder. Sometimes, however, I have an urge to pee when I'm not full and the stream is weak with dribbles. I also seem to want to pee a lot, although it has lessened over the past couple of weeks. I was getting up to pee 6 times a night and now it's down to three. Has anyone had a similar experience? I see my uro in a couple of days, but it's good to know what others have experienced. Thanks!",
