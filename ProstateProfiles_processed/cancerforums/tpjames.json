      "Content": "user326, welcome. I concur with Highlander . Unfortunately, like probably all or at least most of us here, your biopsy is POSITIVE. It's time for action with the appropriate oncologist . A Gleason score of 3+4=7 is demanding action, Gleason 3+3=6 may result in active surveillance but you have two reported 3+4=7 , action is required. I would waste no more time thinking about it but rather get to the urologist or oncologist to discuss and begin a course of treatment. I am somewhat surprised that your URO hasn't already recommended a course of treatment. Two Gleason 7 cores are not a wait and see scenario. The good news is they are treatable , should you look backwards at many of our profiles you will see that most of us have been there done that with even higher Gleason scores. You have many good options but do not delay in a discussion for treatment . Best to you.",

      "Signature": "DOB 1948 good overall health, non smoker, non drinker. Active with physicals, colonoscopy's and PSA testing ( urologist).

The list of questions is excellent but I do feel the Surgeon can answer many of them before you even ask them . Has he entered your specific data into the Sloan Kettering website ? A ton of fairly accurate % answers come out of that. No Surgeon can give you a 100% answer . Incontinence %, ED %,..will the cancer return % etc...I suspect once you choose a surgeon he will indeed do this. Do ask him to him show the surgical path and why , in detail, it will also prompt several questions and answers. Another valid question is, what is primary ? attacking and eliminating the possibility of cancer at the apex vs nerve sparing. The one question I did not ask, as the Surgeon addressed it before I asked , what is my life expectancy. An excellent reply would be 15 years or greater. I believe thats the extreme window for the data right now. This is the question we are all afraid to ask, he was not afraid to address it . A good surgeon will also request that you be in the best physical shape and weight that you can be at the time of Surgery . This can easily lead to a life changing diet and daily habits. As stated above, many of us have been thru this and came thru it with excellent results and recovery. It appears that you are going to be in excellent hands, trust the surgeon.

      "Content": "user326, welcome. I concur with Highlander . Unfortunately, like probably all or at least most of us here, your biopsy is POSITIVE. It's time for action with the appropriate oncologist . A Gleason score of 3+4=7 is demanding action, Gleason 3+3=6 may result in active surveillance but you have two reported 3+4=7 , action is required. I would waste no more time thinking about it but rather get to the urologist or oncologist to discuss and begin a course of treatment. I am somewhat surprised that your URO hasn't already recommended a course of treatment. Two Gleason 7 cores are not a wait and see scenario. The good news is they are treatable , should you look backwards at many of our profiles you will see that most of us have been there done that with even higher Gleason scores. You have many good options but do not delay in a discussion for treatment . Best to you.",

The list of questions is excellent but I do feel the Surgeon can answer many of them before you even ask them . Has he entered your specific data into the Sloan Kettering website ? A ton of fairly accurate % answers come out of that. No Surgeon can give you a 100% answer . Incontinence %, ED %,..will the cancer return % etc...I suspect once you choose a surgeon he will indeed do this. Do ask him to him show the surgical path and why , in detail, it will also prompt several questions and answers. Another valid question is, what is primary ? attacking and eliminating the possibility of cancer at the apex vs nerve sparing. The one question I did not ask, as the Surgeon addressed it before I asked , what is my life expectancy. An excellent reply would be 15 years or greater. I believe thats the extreme window for the data right now. This is the question we are all afraid to ask, he was not afraid to address it . A good surgeon will also request that you be in the best physical shape and weight that you can be at the time of Surgery . This can easily lead to a life changing diet and daily habits. As stated above, many of us have been thru this and came thru it with excellent results and recovery. It appears that you are going to be in excellent hands, trust the surgeon. In my particular case, everything that the Doc( Surgeon ) said was going to happen along with post pathology results, is exactly what happened. I happened to have good news all the way around but he was not surprised, pleased, but not surprised, it's what he expected. Stay the course wishing you the best t",

      "Content": "Winglets, When you say DR, do you mean GP or Urologist ? If it were me I would go see a Urologist where they may request an MRI. It may very well be related to other things like meds. A URO appt should take moments , not years . Typically you don't really need a referral, find out who a leading URO is in your area, call and make an appt. just make sure they are on your INS plan. Regarding prostate issues early, it's not uncommon, and for someone to say it's not a prostate issue in my mind is irresponsible. How do they know ? Remember , we are not Dr's here, unless someone says they are, we are just sharing experiences. I'm back to go see a Urologist, this is what they do. Best to you, let us know how things are going. t",

The Dr's Nurse told me that the bladder is going to take some time to get back to normal, it is now resting on the rectum rather than the prostate so it knows something is different plus it just had a catheter stuck in it that it had to adjust to , now it's gone and has to adjust again.

This journey started well over a year ago when the very stable PSA rose from the hi 2's to the 3's then into the 4's then over 6 this past July. It was not a shock. Quite frankly I was expecting it. The Urologist who I have been seeing for a decade was never shy about using the C word over the last decade. July came , the biopsy was scheduled 5 weeks later, good grief the wait was near impossible . Then post biopsy, the call came , 2 positive spots out of 12. Certainly didn't want to hear this but it was not a shock. The conversations with the Urologist over the last couple of years prepared me for the worst case scenario. He did his job. And very well. Post Biopsy, scheduled appointment with the Surgeon, ( same office ) very detailed, very experienced, very positive , but yet held nothing back. To me this is critical , the flow of information and conversation with regard to whats ahead. No stone unturned. The doc went thru the entire procedure even showed us ( wife and I ) the surgical path, what he is going to do, where he is cutting, where he is not. Also plugged my numbers into the Sloan Kettering data base and showed us where we stand POST surgery. He answered questions I didn't even know to ask. Even those I didn't ask but wanted answers to. Life expectancy greater than 15 years better than 99% ( from this ) Cancer return possible after 10 years under 40 % from this , he believes it will be a lower % because the data base doesn't ask for the surgical path, it's just numbers. 10% incontinence possible 50% impotency possible One thing he made clear, his goal is NO CANCER, he does not spare muscle at the risk of any cancer remaining. He has done over 3000 RALP's and over 1000 non RALP. that in itself is amazing, the amount of men that go thru this. He did laugh and advised us that in 15 years I will bee seeing another Dr as he is retiring in 2 years. 15 years is a long time . I'll be right near 85, he will be 88. He did a Cystoscope during that pre-op visit, , it's terrible, 2 min of pure \" I hate this\". If someone says they are not that bad, they are indeed altering the truth Then the 6 week wait until surgery. just before I left the office he says..oh yeh, no more bread, pasta, potatoes, rice etc...until surgery. Drop 10 pounds please. And walk a mile a day. I'm about 15 or 20 pounds over where I should really be. So for 6 weeks, while waiting , no more of the good food I love, and yes, it looks like I dropped the 10 pounds or very close.

      "Content": "It's a good question but it would be near impossible to seek an accurate answer. Every person that goes thru this does not participate on a forum for various reasons. It's kinda like asking why everyone does not have a Facebook page or why everyone does not Tweet. It does appear that the statistics on this site suggest there are more surgery members rather than radiation treatment members, but that can easily be defined as people who selected surgery are seeking information or answers. I'm one of them . There is no magic wand, but I do know that today, surgery is much more accepted than it was even 10 years ago. The procedure is now considered, as awful as this sounds, common. The idea of having cancer in our body is a tuff one to accept and my take is that if given a choice to get rid of it and deal with the after effects, far outweighs still having it in our body and trying to beat it to death over a long period of time. Another major factor to consider is, it is widely understood that once radiation treatments are selected and begin, surgery is no longer an option should things don't improve. That can be a deal killer for many people, it was for me. OF my few close friends who have had to deal with this nasty beast, the ones who selected surgery, even 10 years ago, far exceed the \"cure time curve \" over those who had radiation treatments. Thats not to say that everyone is equal, we are not. A very close friend who uses the same Dr's as I, it took 10 years of radiation treatments to get him to the point of \"cure\" . In all fairness though, he did not qualify for surgery at the time of diagnosis, his PSA was off the charts and the multiple bad cells had already left the prostate. He recently told me that if he had qualified for surgery he would have selected surgery in a NY minute. Here is the only stat I know, the surgeon that performed my operation, very well known and respected in this region, has performed approx 3000 of these operations over the last 10 years. One thing he did tell me early on, if my spots were G6, I would not have qualified for surgery. His diagnosis for my 1/G8 on the apex, was that we can kill the beast and get it out of your body before it decides to take on another path. We talked about radiation, and we could have gone that direction but once I heard what I had to do over the next several years as well as knowing that we may not beat it, the choice became obvious for both me and my wife. Especially knowing that surgery would no longer be an option. Most likely in the next 10 years PC patients will have yet another option to select, things are improving all the time. maybe in 20 years, RALP will be a thing of the past , who knows... best to you t",

Highlander, maybe \" would not not have qualified\" is the wrong choice of words, The Dr, (Surgeon) , said G6 was a better candidate for AS or perhaps radiation. In his experience , many times G6 never got beyond the G6 stage, while G7 and above had already crossed the chasm. Also consider, he may have been speaking directly about my circumstance, I had two spots, 1/G6 and 1/G8. both around 10/15%. I asked, what if they were both G6. I suspect his answer was directly related to my question and circumstances. I'll see him on Monday, I'll pose the question again. t",

It's kinda like asking why everyone does not have a Facebook page or why everyone does not Tweet. It does appear that the statistics on this site suggest there are more surgery members rather than radiation treatment members, but that can easily be defined as people who selected surgery are seeking information or answers. I'm one of them . There is no magic wand, but I do know that today, surgery is much more accepted than it was even 10 years ago. The procedure is now considered, as awful as this sounds, common. The idea of having cancer in our body is a tuff one to accept and my take is that if given a choice to get rid of it and deal with the after effects, far outweighs still having it in our body and trying to beat it to death over a long period of time. Another major factor to consider is, it is widely understood that once radiation treatments are selected and begin, surgery is no longer an option should things don't improve. That can be a deal killer for many people, it was for me. OF my few close friends who have had to deal with this nasty beast, the ones who selected surgery, even 10 years ago, far exceed the \"cure time curve \" over those who had radiation treatments. Thats not to say that everyone is equal, we are not. A very close friend who uses the same Dr's as I, it took 10 years of radiation treatments to get him to the point of \"cure\" . In all fairness though, he did not qualify for surgery at the time of diagnosis, his PSA was off the charts and the multiple bad cells had already left the prostate. He recently told me that if he had qualified for surgery he would have selected surgery in a NY minute. Here is the only stat I know, the surgeon that performed my operation, very well known and respected in this region, has performed approx 3000 of these operations over the last 10 years. One thing he did tell me early on, if my spots were G6, I would not have qualified for surgery. His diagnosis for my 1/G8 on the apex, was that we can kill the beast and get it out of your body before it decides to take on another path. We talked about radiation, and we could have gone that direction but once I heard what I had to do over the next several years as well as knowing that we may not beat it, the choice became obvious for both me and my wife. Especially knowing that surgery would no longer be an option. Most likely in the next 10 years PC patients will have yet another option to select, things are improving all the time. maybe in 20 years, RALP will be a thing of the past , who knows... best to you t",

      "Content": "7 more days, it felt like an eternity. But I'm ready, relaxed, stressed a bit, but relaxed. ready to move on. I know for me it's the right decision. This journey started well over a year ago when the very stable PSA rose from the hi 2's to the 3's then into the 4's then over 6 this past July. It was not a shock. Quite frankly I was expecting it. The Urologist who I have been seeing for a decade was never shy about using the C word over the last decade. July came , the biopsy was scheduled 5 weeks later, good grief the wait was near impossible . Then post biopsy, the call came , 2 positive spots out of 12. Certainly didn't want to hear this but it was not a shock. The conversations with the Urologist over the last couple of years prepared me for the worst case scenario. He did his job. And very well. Post Biopsy, scheduled appointment with the Surgeon, ( same office ) very detailed, very experienced, very positive , but yet held nothing back. To me this is critical , the flow of information and conversation with regard to whats ahead. No stone unturned. The doc went thru the entire procedure even showed us ( wife and I ) the surgical path, what he is going to do, where he is cutting, where he is not. Also plugged my numbers into the Sloan Kettering data base and showed us where we stand POST surgery. He answered questions I didn't even know to ask. Even those I didn't ask but wanted answers to. Life expectancy greater than 15 years better than 99% ( from this ) Cancer return possible after 10 years under 40 % from this , he believes it will be a lower % because the data base doesn't ask for the surgical path, it's just numbers. 10% incontinence possible 50% impotency possible One thing he made clear, his goal is NO CANCER, he does not spare muscle at the risk of any cancer remaining. He has done over 3000 RALP's and over 1000 non RALP. that in itself is amazing, the amount of men that go thru this. He did laugh and advised us that in 15 years I will bee seeing another Dr as he is retiring in 2 years. 15 years is a long time . I'll be right near 85, he will be 88. He did a Cystoscope during that pre-op visit, , it's terrible, 2 min of pure \" I hate this\". If someone says they are not that bad, they are indeed altering the truth Then the 6 week wait until surgery. just before I left the office he says..oh yeh, no more bread, pasta, potatoes, rice etc...until surgery. Drop 10 pounds please. And walk a mile a day. I'm about 15 or 20 pounds over where I should really be. So for 6 weeks, while waiting , no more of the good food I love, and yes, it looks like I dropped the 10 pounds or very close. I have been in constant communication with 2 or 3 friends who have been thru the same thing, I also stopped all Google searches as well. There is no point anymore. Other than a few visits to this forum now and then, I stay away. The folks on this forum are very positive and informative. people tell me I am very positive, I guess I am but treatment , surgery or chemo, is not a choice, it's mandatory. You can't dwell on it. We made the decision best for us, the Doc agrees and now the 6 weeks is just about here. I have 3 PRE Surgery appts today, Kegel exercises at the Hospital, then the final pre-surgery with the surgeons office, then back to the Hospital PRE OP for \" how ya gonna pay for all this\" . Long day, but the end is near. The only thing I want to know about now is the post surgery report. Thats where my mind is now, I'm beyond the surgery. 7 days to go.... I am still very nervous and have high anxiety. When I wake up after it's done, life will be somewhat different but my wife and I both agree that we will finally be on the other side of all of this.",

      "Content": "Like many, I started kegels before surgery, maybe 1 week. 3 or 4 times a day. I visited the kegel rehab gal only once before surgery. She ran a butt muscle test on me, like an EKG but on my butt. I had to hold the muscles firm for 10 seconds maybe 5 times in a row and she graphed it. I didn't even know there was a such thing. regardless, she said my butt muscles were reporting the proper strength which was measured as a 4 or 5 on the graph scale. She told me the reason for this test was that the surgeon wanted to know how my muscles worked BEFORE the surgery as a ref. Well, they work. I was told I would not be back to see her unless I had total incontinence for a couple of months post surgery. She told me to do kegels several times a day which I do. Also of note, I weighed 187 when all this started, my target weight is probably 170, the Dr asked me to drop 10 pounds and walk at least 1 mile a day, he said I would thank him during post surgery recovery. I went with basically no carbs for 6 weeks and walked the 1 mile a day. At surgery I weighed in at 175 . Post surgery, yes, I am thanking him. My gut is much smaller and the incisions are really healing well. Getting up and down , sitting to standing, is obviously 13 pounds for the better. Standing from sitting or lying down is the #1 incontinence issue. Currently, I am 17 days post surgery, I have not soaked any pads, any depends or the bed . There is leakage, not a ton, mostly when standing up from sitting or lying down. I find I can hold it until I get to the bathroom, probably not a lot farther but I can hold it. I can also stop the stream if I try. So things are working . I have regular BM's every morning now as I did before the surgery. It took a few days after coming home from the Hosp for those to start and when they did, they became more regular each day. I find that I have the urge to pee , or at least it feels like it, to go to the bathroom every couple of hours. It seems that for first couple of weeks post surgery this is fairly common , as the bladder is also trying to recover. I don't fight it. If I feel like I gotta go, I'm going. I also try to hold it at this time, and find I can, at least briefly. One thing I know, I am not 100% incontinent, probably not even 50% . I think I am somewhere in the 25% window. I can hold it and I am not really wetting anything but I don't really know how long I can hold it yet. In one more week I am changing from Depends to regular underwear with a pad, You can't go to a urinal with the Depends, there is not 'SLOT' in the front. When I make the change I feel like I will be able to petty much go anywhere , no restrictions. I may use the Depends at night for another period of time just in case. Do know that when standing from sitting or when coughing or sneezing, there will be leakage, maybe a very large drop. How is that measured in incontinence % ? I don't know. But it is not a full emptying of the bladder. In comparison, whenever my wife laughs big time, coughs or sneezes, she gives up a drop, always has. I am doing kegels several times a day although If I exert too much holding pressure, 1 or 2 of my incisions tells me to lighten up ! Reflecting back, dropping that 13 pounds pre surgery , at the time I didn't understand the significance, now I do. Hope all this helps best to you t",

      "Content": "Like many, I started kegels before surgery, maybe 1 week. 3 or 4 times a day. I visited the kegel rehab gal only once before surgery. She ran a butt muscle test on me, like an EKG but on my butt. I had to hold the muscles firm for 10 seconds maybe 5 times in a row and she graphed it. I didn't even know there was a such thing. regardless, she said my butt muscles were reporting the proper strength which was measured as a 4 or 5 on the graph scale. She told me the reason for this test was that the surgeon wanted to know how my muscles worked BEFORE the surgery as a ref. Well, they work. I was told I would not be back to see her unless I had total incontinence for a couple of months post surgery. She told me to do kegels several times a day which I do. Also of note, I weighed 187 when all this started, my target weight is probably 170, the Dr asked me to drop 10 pounds and walk at least 1 mile a day, he said I would thank him during post surgery recovery. I went with basically no carbs for 6 weeks and walked the 1 mile a day. At surgery I weighed in at 175 . Post surgery, yes, I am thanking him. My gut is much smaller and the incisions are really healing well. Getting up and down , sitting to standing, is obviously 13 pounds for the better. Standing from sitting or lying down is the #1 incontinence issue. Currently, I am 17 days post surgery, I have not soaked any pads, any depends or the bed . There is leakage, not a ton, mostly when standing up from sitting or lying down. I find I can hold it until I get to the bathroom, probably not a lot farther but I can hold it. I can also stop the stream if I try. So things are working . I have regular BM's every morning now as I did before the surgery. It took a few days after coming home from the Hosp for those to start and when they did, they became more regular each day. I find that I have the urge to pee , or at least it feels like it, to go to the bathroom every couple of hours. It seems that for first couple of weeks post surgery this is fairly common , as the bladder is also trying to recover. I don't fight it. If I feel like I gotta go, I'm going. I also try to hold it at this time, and find I can, at least briefly. One thing I know, I am not 100% incontinent, probably not even 50% . I think I am somewhere in the 25% window. I can hold it and I am not really wetting anything but I don't really know how long I can hold it yet. In one more week I am changing from Depends to regular underwear with a pad, You can't go to a urinal with the Depends, there is not 'SLOT' in the front. When I make the change I feel like I will be able to petty much go anywhere , no restrictions. I may use the Depends at night for another period of time just in case. Do know that when standing from sitting or when coughing or sneezing, there will be leakage, maybe a very large drop. How is that measured in incontinence % ? I don't know. But it is not a full emptying of the bladder. In comparison, whenever my wife laughs big time, coughs or sneezes, she gives up a drop, always has. I am doing kegels several times a day although If I exert too much holding pressure, 1 or 2 of my incisions tells me to lighten up ! Reflecting back, dropping that 13 pounds pre surgery , at the time I didn't understand the significance, now I do. Hope all this helps best to you t",

      "Content": "welcome and thanks for posting. Sorry to learn of this situation for your your dad. There is no harm in seeking guidance from the cardiologist and following his orders. This is indeed a major surgery. I am certainly no Dr but will offer an opinion regarding the other concerns. Gleason 7 is a serious concern and needs to be treated soon, but, . if your Urologist said waiting another 6 months is acceptable, thats his call and his alone. Surgery is certainly a viable option and I can say from my own experience , while others here are very similar, they put you out, you wake up 5 or 6 hours later with a Catheter and spend one or two nights in the Hospital. I had minimal pains and required no medications. We are not allowed to do anything really physical for 6 weeks so activity is really at a low. Basically we are sitting around , watching TV and taking short walks and taking naps. Doing very little. The healing time was very painless and easy. I think our hearts are getting a good long rest ! There is no oral medication that I am aware of that we can take during the waiting period PRE Surgery, to fight the cancer cells. The good news is Prostate Cancer is a very slow growing entity, I have a few friends who have taken easily 6 months to make a decision from the time of diagnosis to treatment so that \"time\" window appears to be not an issue. We all also know others who have had the C cells for years undetected even though they had multiple biopsy's. One friend went just shy of two years before it was even discovered, even though his PSA tests were coming back very high time and time again. I think he had 3 biopsy's and then two MRI's before discovering the bad cells. Post Surgery he is doing just fine, cancer free. Wishing you the best, keep us updated. t",

      "Content": "welcome and thanks for posting. Sorry to learn of this situation for your your dad. There is no harm in seeking guidance from the cardiologist and following his orders. This is indeed a major surgery. I am certainly no Dr but will offer an opinion regarding the other concerns. Gleason 7 is a serious concern and needs to be treated soon, but, . if your Urologist said waiting another 6 months is acceptable, thats his call and his alone. Surgery is certainly a viable option and I can say from my own experience , while others here are very similar, they put you out, you wake up 5 or 6 hours later with a Catheter and spend one or two nights in the Hospital. I had minimal pains and required no medications. We are not allowed to do anything really physical for 6 weeks so activity is really at a low. Basically we are sitting around , watching TV and taking short walks and taking naps. Doing very little. The healing time was very painless and easy. I think our hearts are getting a good long rest ! There is no oral medication that I am aware of that we can take during the waiting period PRE Surgery, to fight the cancer cells. The good news is Prostate Cancer is a very slow growing entity, I have a few friends who have taken easily 6 months to make a decision from the time of diagnosis to treatment so that \"time\" window appears to be not an issue. We all also know others who have had the C cells for years undetected even though they had multiple biopsy's. One friend went just shy of two years before it was even discovered, even though his PSA tests were coming back very high time and time again. I think he had 3 biopsy's and then two MRI's before discovering the bad cells. Post Surgery he is doing just fine, cancer free. Wishing you the best, keep us updated. t",

      "Content": "Surgery scheduled for Nov 21. Had the cystoscope yesterday, the surgeon does this with every patient pre-surgery. It's not that it is a pain thing but rather really uncomfortable. More in the 'good grief\" category. Thank god it only lasts 1 min or 2. It's very quick. My bladder and all area's were clear. no surprises. The surgeon has performed 3400 RARP procedures and over 1000 pre- RARP procedures, he is very complete, very detailed, very positive. He also had my wife and I watch a video of the RARP so we knew what to expect and how it is performed. It's pretty amazing. All this being said, it's never a good situation to have these bad cells in us but at least knowing you are in the right place and in the right hands takes the edge off, somewhat. The Doc feels he is probably going to downgrade my Gleason 8 to a 7 based on the lab results and other criteria. He spent a great deal of time talking about POST surgery, what to expect , lab results, then on to life style . He has me starting on \"sildenafil\" ( 20mg) right now.( Viagra) Pre surgery , he wants to insure that I don't have any side effects . This script is not for recreation but rather 'blood flow\" for the muscle bundles. He recommends I take it every day for 1 year. I can deal with it, it's $ 1/ pill. He has already advised me on the surgical path to remove the prostate, one muscle bundle will be near 100 % spared but the opposite side he is taking 50% of the bundle. One of my bad cells is near the edge and he wants it gone so he is stepping over the line as the preemptive measure. He told us that the rate of returning bad cells post surgery is under 5% with all of his patients, no return for everyone is the ultimate goal. This is why he is not going to try to spare the 2nd muscle bundle 100%. My wife and I know what to expect from this going forward. No secrets. No cancer is the goal. He ran my numbers thru the Sloan Kettering website calculator and the long term numbers are in my favor over the long haul. Survival rate ( from this) past 15 years better than 99%. Then there are several other factor rates in the 10 year period such as likely hood of cells popping up in the same area, whereas those are in the under 40 % category, but even he commented that there are things that are not factored in, such as the surgical path. he feels that the 10 year possible return factor will be much lower in my situation. Each case is different. In 15 years I will be near 85, in 10 near 80 , I feel I can be comfortable with these stats. All of the pre-surgery procedures are completed, now it's on to Nov 21, and then what follows. The most important thing we are looking for is a negative lab report following surgery, he feels I am in the under 5% category for a positive ( bad) report. He reminded us that there is no such thing as a 100% guarantee of a negative report and that an under 5% chance of seeing bad cells on the post surgery report is quite good.

He just said, no more bread, no more potatoes, no more rice, no more Ice Cream, no more pasta..etc..all the good stuff, and walk 1 mile a day. I can do this. Actually I have been wanting to do this . Staying positive Best to all of you tony",

      "Content": "Justin, welcome and thx for your post. Do realize that many of us here have been thru a similar circumstance. You are not alone and this is not uncommon. My take would be , (I'm not a Dr), is that the the Sloan Kettering 3+4=7 is more likely to be the case . What you didn't mention is the % of the grade 7 which may imply low risk. Regardless, I agree with Highlander above, with your very young age and high PSA numbers , the red flag is waving, and has been for a pretty long time. The good news is , whatever grade you have , 6 or 7, you now know it, that beats not knowing every day of the week. I suggest getting to an oncologist for treatment discussions without anymore delay. Prostate cancer is slow moving but it's still moving. Also keep in mind that when we go for biopsy's , the dreaded news is that sometimes it can take several biopsy's to report back the findings . If the sample size is small and the % is small, it can be easily undetected. The core sample could have missed it. A very close friend had 4 biopsy's over a two year period with a very HI PSA, they all came back negative. Fortunately the Uro wasn't convinced and ordered some sort of special MRI which finally discovered positive cells in a very small confined area of the prostate which a biopsy would never have found. A year now, post surgery he is doing fine and is cancer free. As crazy as this seems, learning that we have prostate cancer is a really bad day, no doubt, but look at it as a positive. Having it and not knowing it is FAR worse and can even be life threatening. You are on the right road , we all hate to hear it but it is what it is, we can't change it, but we can treat it with incredible success. When I was diagnosed last Sept, it was like a dark cloud was glued to my head.

      "Content": "Rick, not to worry. I am now just over 5 months post surgery. Typically a Doc may recommend taking 20 MG/ Day of Sildenafil, which I have been taking since early Nov last year. I am still taking it. ED is a very common \"AFTER Surgery\" thing. For SEX, typically 100 MG is the recommended dosage, so 4 or 5 pills is appropriate. Now, on the other side is \"other methods\" . I just recently began injection therapy as the 100 MG dosage had minimal effect, even with sensations. Some say it is too early to begin therapy but others say if it feels right, get it started. We are all different and we all react differently. The point is to wake it up. I am having reasonable success with the injection therapy, both the Pharmacist and Doc want to know all the details . So far ( a few trial injections) I have no bad issues or side effects related to the trimix injections. 3 Months may be a bit premature but really your Doc is the one who gets to decide that based on your healing progress. Wishing you the best for a fast recovery, don't rush it though. We feel good on the outside but inside our body is still angry at us for the surgery ! t",

      "Content": "Lots of variations it seems. Post Surgery, My Dr. told me to drop 10 pounds before surgery. I was only about 20 over. I had 6 weeks to do it. I basically cut out all extra carbs, no pasta, no rice, no potatoes, no bread , no snacks. I thought it would be difficult, it was not at all. I ate cold cuts, cheese, my wife cooked her typical meals, chicken, beef, pork without the carb sides . We sub'd with veggies which I am not a big fan of. I still had Ice Cream, drank my coffee and lots of water, got rid of Gatorade and soda. I ate more Banana's than a monkey and cans of Tuna in water, which surprisingly I always liked. I was not hungry. I didn't really miss the big carb dishes. The day before surgery, no solid food and only back coffee or water up to midnight. I drank that Magnesium Citrate stuff the day before. The day of surgery, nothing , no food no drink. I weighed in down 10 pounds at surgery. i started at 187. I was 177 at surgery. Post Surgery. Liquid diet until passing gas and first BM. From there they said eat away. No restrictions. My wife and I both changed our eating habits over that 6 week pre period, I dropped 10, I think she dropped 8 or so, she eats less than me. we have no plans to go full hog back to what we were doing so post surgery we indeed changed our eating habits. When I weighed in at the catheter removal last week I was down another 3 pounds, not surprised, I basically didn't eat any food of substance for 2 days before and 2 days following surgery. Even at that, once home my appetite was very small. I like that I dropped 13 pounds and would like to maintain most if the weight loss, which was mostly from no carbs . So with moderation I think all will be well. Post surgery, my feeling is it is best to eat lite, stay away from heavy foods , starches, spices, sauces etc,until the body has regained normalcy, this can probably take a few weeks. Go easy, use stool softeners, don't over eat, the body will like us ! I also think avoiding any alcohol is probably best for several weeks post. best to you t",

      "Content": "all, thx so much for the replies. I am now 15 days post surgery and 5 days post catheter removal. Like stated above, it seems that I am getting the urges every 2 or 3 hours, so I go. I find I can HOLD it until I get to the toilet but I still have some leakage. I'm hoping that the urges get farther apart but I'm not waiting, if I feel pressure, I'm going. At night though, It's very uncomfortable, early night I have lots of pressure , swelling and throbbing , I can't find a comfortable position to sleep. I get up every couple of hours to pee, I'm not wetting the pads or anything like that though. Later in the night it appears to get better but I am still working in a 2 to 3 hour pee widow. Thats where I was PRE surgery with BPH. the difference now though is I know ( feel) I am emptying the bladder unlike before. There is a steam , not a dribble. I have to remind myself that I am still just 5 days post catheter removal and 15 days post surgery. I'm pretty certain that my body is not near where it should be. best to all t",

      "Content": "I'm two weeks post surgery now and 4 days post catheter removal. Incisions healing very well, now black and blue though. My gut Looks like I was in a fight with a very short person who had good aim at my gut with his or her fists. regarding the catheter though, it was removed 4 days ago, it's still very strange. I \"leak\" , not when sitting or laying down, but when standing. I really can't tell if I have an urge to go or not, it's a strange sensation, it's more like pressure. yesterday and this morning, as I stood, I was able to squeeze and hold it for a short run to the toilet then release without leaking. I find I can stop the \"stream\" while it's in progress so I am assuming that this is good news on the way to \" holding \" it. I do get up to go to the toilet a few times at night just because I really can't say for certain what the urge feels like yet. I can't really tell whats going on yet. I feel some pressure thats about it. I am able to empty my bladder and for the most part the pads are either dry or just slightly wet, not soaked. I think I was expecting much worse, or maybe I don't really know what to expect. This is all new to me. Currently the biggest issue is when standing, I can hold it if I concentrate and try hard, but I still expect leakage. Before I shower, I empty my bladder , it seems I have a few minutes before it may decide to leak again so there is not much time to waste . It appears I am able to \"hold\" it for a brief time. If I cough or sneeze, I do have leakage, I can feel it happening. . I am on the last day of antibiotic meds and I do still have the spasm med ( oxybutynin 10 mg/) which I do take now and then, not everyday. Last night it was like I had big time pressure on my penis, but it passed after a few hours.I did take one of those spasm pills. I'll continue kegels several times a day but if I do them hard and firm, my incisions know it. best to all... t",

Surprised they never advised you. I have 7 more days with the catheter , so we'll see. I also was recommended to just use the ONE Foley bag, which is what we will do, they gave me a smaller one but I have no plans to use it. The Dr told me that the bag and catheter was what he termed, my life line to the surgery , treat it all with the utmost care. best to you, hope you fell better real soon. t",

      "Content": "Anthony, so very sorry to hear of your dads diagnosis, but if there is any good news, it is that he learned of it now. Learning of it is far better than not knowing. The other good news is there are treatments which can either cure and/ or allow him to have a long productive life. Early detection and treatment is the key. It's very difficult to learn that we have cancer, the dreaded disease that we all hope and pray we can avoid in our lifetime. But on the flip side is knowing we have it and treating it is 100% better than having it and NOT knowing, which allows it to run whatever path it happens to take. I suspect the Dr has the full report and has just not shared it yet , or maybe he did and it was not understood. They do not keep this a secret. This is the entire point of the biopsy. A PSA of 8 is an indicator , lower than some, higher that others. At his age of 62 it is generally accepted as being too high. The 5 positive spots are the true indicator but you really need to know the specific details for each spot, as mentioned above. That is the determining factor. What are the Gleason scores and what are the percentages for each positive core. For ex ; Gleason 6 is understood to perhaps only require \"active surveillance \" , while Geason 7 and above will suggest some form of treatment. Gleason 10 being the worst case which requires treatment, be it surgery or radiation. Before you can go forward this has to be known. Any treatment, any path forward , will be based on the identified positive cores and cancer percentages of the individual cores , then your dad along with the oncologist can make the best decision on which treatment to proceed with. The other good news is this is a slow moving entity, many of us here went several months from diagnosis to treatment and we all had the same anxiety's, what should I do, whats best for me. Your dad is not alone here . He is in remarkable company. Obtain the full report and add it to your forum signature , you do that by going to settings, edit signature. In this manner, those who comment can see the report details and comment accordingly. Maybe this will help ease the anxiety, I have friends ( we all do ) who have had either surgery or treatments, well over 10 years ago. All are still around living a good life. It seems that men our age, 60+, wherever we go, we hear, \"yeh I had that done a few years ago\" . We don't want to hear this stuff about ourselves obviously, and when when we do the anxiety runs high. But do know that it is very common and the cure rates are extremely high. Again, early detection and treatments are the key here. It sounds like you are very early in the process. If you can find a Dr closer to home, that is also a benefit and will not pose any issue for any current Dr you may have. best to you and your dad. Stay the course, stay positive. t",

      "Content": "I'm two weeks post surgery now and 4 days post catheter removal. Incisions healing very well, now black and blue though. My gut Looks like I was in a fight with a very short person who had good aim at my gut with his or her fists. regarding the catheter though, it was removed 4 days ago, it's still very strange. I \"leak\" , not when sitting or laying down, but when standing. I really can't tell if I have an urge to go or not, it's a strange sensation, it's more like pressure. yesterday and this morning, as I stood, I was able to squeeze and hold it for a short run to the toilet then release without leaking. I find I can stop the \"stream\" while it's in progress so I am assuming that this is good news on the way to \" holding \" it. I do get up to go to the toilet a few times at night just because I really can't say for certain what the urge feels like yet. I can't really tell whats going on yet. I feel some pressure thats about it. I am able to empty my bladder and for the most part the pads are either dry or just slightly wet, not soaked. I think I was expecting much worse, or maybe I don't really know what to expect. This is all new to me. Currently the biggest issue is when standing, I can hold it if I concentrate and try hard, but I still expect leakage. Before I shower, I empty my bladder , it seems I have a few minutes before it may decide to leak again so there is not much time to waste . It appears I am able to \"hold\" it for a brief time. If I cough or sneeze, I do have leakage, I can feel it happening. . I am on the last day of antibiotic meds and I do still have the spasm med ( oxybutynin 10 mg/) which I do take now and then, not everyday. Last night it was like I had big time pressure on my penis, but it passed after a few hours.I did take one of those spasm pills. I'll continue kegels several times a day but if I do them hard and firm, my incisions know it. best to all... t",

      "Content": "all, thx so much for the replies. I am now 15 days post surgery and 5 days post catheter removal. Like stated above, it seems that I am getting the urges every 2 or 3 hours, so I go. I find I can HOLD it until I get to the toilet but I still have some leakage. I'm hoping that the urges get farther apart but I'm not waiting, if I feel pressure, I'm going. At night though, It's very uncomfortable, early night I have lots of pressure , swelling and throbbing , I can't find a comfortable position to sleep. I get up every couple of hours to pee, I'm not wetting the pads or anything like that though. Later in the night it appears to get better but I am still working in a 2 to 3 hour pee widow. Thats where I was PRE surgery with BPH. the difference now though is I know ( feel) I am emptying the bladder unlike before. There is a steam , not a dribble. I have to remind myself that I am still just 5 days post catheter removal and 15 days post surgery. I'm pretty certain that my body is not near where it should be. best to all t",

Many of us have been through it, probably all had the exact same emotions. Me included. I personally stayed really busy right up to the day before, knowing I had a 6 week wait before resuming physical activity. I did things around the yard, house etc well in advance. Once we, wife and I, made the decision for surgery our minds both raced way past the surgery to the pathology report following surgery, that became our focus . I hate to say that the surgery was a piece of cake , but it was a like piece of cake . No pains, no meds, couple of nights stay in the Hosp where they treated me like a king, then home for a 10 day relationship with Mr Catheter. Once the Catheter was removed the healing began and life was returning to somewhat normal rather rapidly. For sure it can be a battle of nerves but you will be on the other side soon.

      "Content": "lexpar. wishing you the best, do remember though that the entire purpose of the surgery is to rid you of the nasty entity. Many of us have been through it, probably all had the exact same emotions. Me included. I personally stayed really busy right up to the day before, knowing I had a 6 week wait before resuming physical activity. I did things around the yard, house etc well in advance. Once we, wife and I, made the decision for surgery our minds both raced way past the surgery to the pathology report following surgery, that became our focus . I hate to say that the surgery was a piece of cake , but it was a like piece of cake . No pains, no meds, couple of nights stay in the Hosp where they treated me like a king, then home for a 10 day relationship with Mr Catheter. Once the Catheter was removed the healing began and life was returning to somewhat normal rather rapidly. For sure it can be a battle of nerves but you will be on the other side soon.

      "Content": "Mandy, I'm not a Dr but to me this may be typical and normal. There are many reasons for a slight PSA rise , Cancer is only one. At age 57, PSA 2.6 does not appear to be out of control or a sharp increase. As we get older our numbers rise, it's just what they do. He does however need to keep being tested yearly, this is how we , as we get older, stay informed. This is not a fight he wants to lose. Don't mean to embarrass you, but SEX before the PSA test can reveal a higher number. Many of us have experienced very similar PSA increases , of which they are just signs or a flag to have another test done . What the Docs are looking for are sharp INCREASES over a 1 year or so period, sometimes even less. By comparison, I am now 69, 10 years ago my numbers were hovering around 2, then gradually increased into the high 2's, then into the 3's . Over the last 24 months my numbers went from the 3's into the 4's then into the 6's. Thats a FLAG for a biopsy. You are very smart in asking these questions and then insisting on the yearly tests. If the numbers begin to rise you can even revert to 6 month testing. it is said that once we get into our late 60's going into our 70's, a PSA over 4 is not uncommon. But exceeding 4's can be a flag to an issue. My take on this is that every man over 55 should know what his PSA number is. Last year, this year , going into next year. It's a blood test, not an operation. It's tracking a trend. Don't take it for granted because all of a sudden it can be 15 or 20, or higher. Prostate Cancer is one that is treatable but you gotta know you have it to treat it. If we do not take action, Prostate Cancer can turn into something much worse which will require different treatments. Early detection is mandatory. best to you and your husband. t",

Silly question, did you have sex shortly before the last PSA ? ( actually not so silly) You do not have to wait 1 year, get the PSA every 6 months if it gives you peace of mind. I did.

One thing though, don't miss a year.

      "Content": "While I read the document above , and I am not arguing with it, but it appears to imply that there are many men with REGRET over choosing RALP for localized treatment. I'm not sure I buy that. There are way too many factors as to why one man would choose a specific treatment over another man. I would agree however that EMOTIONS is huge. When we hear the words, \" YOU HAVE CANCER\" , we check out of the universe we are living in and begin a new life in an alternative universe, one where we are seeking the answers to \"how do I get this stuff out of me\" and \"How long do I have\" ? I suspect that once we hear a reasonable answer to question # 1, we make a decision . We now also have the ability to learn what other men have experienced, with similar but not exact circumstances. Regarding question #2, a seasoned Dr will answer it before we even ask it. It appears that most use the Sloan Kettering 15 year window of survival percentages. 15 years is a long time. My Mother had colon cancer, she passed 12 or 13 years later from heart disease. My father passed from a heart attack at 75, I'm 69, if I meet or exceed the 15 year window I will have lived 9 years longer than my father and he didn't even have cancer. I certainly am one for analyzing and reading stats , but somehow I think thats just what they are. An avenue for someone who is flat out scarred to find some emotional relief. Do these stats mean I am going to survive ? Am I going to live another 15 years or longer ? Good question. The stats do place us in a survival window but even at that, it's a percentage. The initial topic is posed as \"localized\" , when I was diagnosed it was expected and understood to be localized, they used 95% as the %, the Doc could never use 100% as the Prostate was inside of me, he couldn't look at it. All he could do was go by the MRI scans etc... I would be a bad stat to the above as I have no regrets. Question # 1 was still of primary importance, and as the various treatments were explained to me, I selected surgery ,as it was the best opportunity to get the dang cancer out of me, at this specific time, EARLY Detection. Had I waited another 6 months or a year, who can say. I can tell ya this, had I waited another year and then learned it was no longer localized, then I would have had regret. I indeed had that option. I had some time, but with a G8, I didn't have extended time. I realize that many men decide on other treatments which is excellent, thank god we have options, but we are each emotionally different , At that moment when we hear \" you have cancer\" , everything else just doesn't seem so important anymore. As stated earlier, many men , if it's possible, just want the cancer gone from our body . If the best opportunity to get the cancer out of our body is surgery, and it is indeed reported as localized with the post op path report, I don't see REGRET as even being part of the equation. I have no regrets , regardless of what the future offers. I can only speak for me though. t",

At your young age, it is really best to go over the treatments that best fit you and your family's concerns with your urologist/oncologist . We can each share what was good for us but at the end of the day, although we may have similar circumstances, we are each very different and will respond to treatments differently. I have posted my post surgery experiences threads ( 7 days now ) ( tpjames ) for others to review and maybe gain some information. My recovery is going well and progress is tracking as expected and similar to others. I have learned tons from others before me and it has really helped me personally pre surgery as well as post surgery.

      "Content": "While I read the document above , and I am not arguing with it, but it appears to imply that there are many men with REGRET over choosing RALP for localized treatment. I'm not sure I buy that. There are way too many factors as to why one man would choose a specific treatment over another man. I would agree however that EMOTIONS is huge. When we hear the words, \" YOU HAVE CANCER\" , we check out of the universe we are living in and begin a new life in an alternative universe, one where we are seeking the answers to \"how do I get this stuff out of me\" and \"How long do I have\" ? I suspect that once we hear a reasonable answer to question # 1, we make a decision . We now also have the ability to learn what other men have experienced, with similar but not exact circumstances. Regarding question #2, a seasoned Dr will answer it before we even ask it. It appears that most use the Sloan Kettering 15 year window of survival percentages. 15 years is a long time. My Mother had colon cancer, she passed 12 or 13 years later from heart disease. My father passed from a heart attack at 75, I'm 69, if I meet or exceed the 15 year window I will have lived 9 years longer than my father and he didn't even have cancer. I certainly am one for analyzing and reading stats , but somehow I think thats just what they are. An avenue for someone who is flat out scarred to find some emotional relief. Do these stats mean I am going to survive ? Am I going to live another 15 years or longer ? Good question. The stats do place us in a survival window but even at that, it's a percentage. The initial topic is posed as \"localized\" , when I was diagnosed it was expected and understood to be localized, they used 95% as the %, the Doc could never use 100% as the Prostate was inside of me, he couldn't look at it. All he could do was go by the MRI scans etc... I would be a bad stat to the above as I have no regrets. Question # 1 was still of primary importance, and as the various treatments were explained to me, I selected surgery ,as it was the best opportunity to get the dang cancer out of me, at this specific time, EARLY Detection. Had I waited another 6 months or a year, who can say. I can tell ya this, had I waited another year and then learned it was no longer localized, then I would have had regret. I indeed had that option. I had some time, but with a G8, I didn't have extended time. I realize that many men decide on other treatments which is excellent, thank god we have options, but we are each emotionally different , At that moment when we hear \" you have cancer\" , everything else just doesn't seem so important anymore. As stated earlier, many men , if it's possible, just want the cancer gone from our body . If the best opportunity to get the cancer out of our body is surgery, and it is indeed reported as localized with the post op path report, I don't see REGRET as even being part of the equation. I have no regrets , regardless of what the future offers. I can only speak for me though. t",

While the Doc was concerned about the 6.5 he was more concerned with what I think he referred to as the free PSA level which which typically was in the high teens and now was around 7 or 8. So Biopsy ordered and done, . Urologist, not GP. Been going to the Urologist for 10 years now. This is their skill set . He said my numbers on the big scale shows 25% no chance of C, 50% a possibility of C and 25% a probability of C. But he reminded me that it's numbers . The biopsy itself was not near the worst case procedure I thought it would be, the initial WAND or whatever we wanna call it, to me, was more uncomfortable that then actual 12 snips. I didn't find it to be painful but rather uncomfortable. The whole procedure took at best 10 or 12 minutes. Certainly we need to be on antibiotics for a day before , the day of and the day after. They also give an antibiotic injection just before the procedure. I had been given some relaxers, probably a Valium of sorts but decided to not take them, I have a pretty high threshold. The Doc told me he would call in a few days with the results and we would take it from there. Am I worried ? Sure, but not to the point of going crazy, gotta deal with it. If the snips are positive I have already decided to yank the prostate. If they are not, well, we'll just carry on . After conversations with several friends my age, who had the Prostate removed, they are enjoying life , sure with a few modifications of lifestyle, but otherwise carrying on. I also know a few who did NOT remove the Prostate and went with treatments. They are NOT doing well, it seems they are constantly dealing with the same issue, over and over again along with continued treatments. I'll report back in a few days. t",

      "Content": "thank you all for the comments. Obviously concerned . I have been with McKay Urology in the Charlotte NC area for 8 or so years. Very well known and respected. The last 3 years I have been on a 6 month PSA, my choice. Only the last 3 periods did the rise get sharp and the last one had a very low Free PSA # as well. Not knowing all the lab results details at this time, I do have a scheduled appt. for Monday morning ( 4 days from now) which will hopefully reveal what should be done going forward. I will post all of the details of the lab results when I get them, they are not yet posted on my account on-line profile. If there is any good news ,( not actually good) it is that the first biopsy revealed 2 positive cores rather than having to repeat the biopsy several times which seems that at the end of the day they end up positive at some point. I am thinking this gets the whole process moving forward sooner rather than later. I am definitely a get it done now kind of person , waiting has never been a strong point for me. If I had to repeat the biopsy several times over a year or more I would have been stressed just from that alone. At least now I know whats going on. I am not shocked, disappointed yes, shocked, no. Thank you all, I wish none of us had to be on this board. Staying the course tony",

I didn't find it to be painful but rather uncomfortable. The whole procedure took at best 10 or 12 minutes. Certainly we need to be on antibiotics for a day before , the day of and the day after. They also give an antibiotic injection just before the procedure. I had been given some relaxers, probably a Valium of sorts but decided to not take them, I have a pretty high threshold. The Doc told me he would call in a few days with the results and we would take it from there. Am I worried ? Sure, but not to the point of going crazy, gotta deal with it. If the snips are positive I have already decided to yank the prostate. If they are not, well, we'll just carry on . After conversations with several friends my age, who had the Prostate removed, they are enjoying life , sure with a few modifications of lifestyle, but otherwise carrying on. I also know a few who did NOT remove the Prostate and went with treatments. They are NOT doing well, it seems they are constantly dealing with the same issue, over and over again along with continued treatments. I'll report back in a few days. t",

      "Content": "thank you all for the comments. Obviously concerned . I have been with McKay Urology in the Charlotte NC area for 8 or so years. Very well known and respected. The last 3 years I have been on a 6 month PSA, my choice. Only the last 3 periods did the rise get sharp and the last one had a very low Free PSA # as well. Not knowing all the lab results details at this time, I do have a scheduled appt. for Monday morning ( 4 days from now) which will hopefully reveal what should be done going forward. I will post all of the details of the lab results when I get them, they are not yet posted on my account on-line profile. If there is any good news ,( not actually good) it is that the first biopsy revealed 2 positive cores rather than having to repeat the biopsy several times which seems that at the end of the day they end up positive at some point. I am thinking this gets the whole process moving forward sooner rather than later. I am definitely a get it done now kind of person , waiting has never been a strong point for me. If I had to repeat the biopsy several times over a year or more I would have been stressed just from that alone. At least now I know whats going on. I am not shocked, disappointed yes, shocked, no. Thank you all, I wish none of us had to be on this board. Staying the course tony",

      "Content": "iicec, thanks for posting and sharing. Indeed thats a lot of positive spots. Even at G6. For my worries the %'s are very high which is an indicator of future concerns. At your young age, it is really best to go over the treatments that best fit you and your family's concerns with your urologist/oncologist . We can each share what was good for us but at the end of the day, although we may have similar circumstances, we are each very different and will respond to treatments differently. I have posted my post surgery experiences threads ( 7 days now ) ( tpjames ) for others to review and maybe gain some information. My recovery is going well and progress is tracking as expected and similar to others. I have learned tons from others before me and it has really helped me personally pre surgery as well as post surgery. Under your forum \"settings\" , edit your signature to include your stats, as this is helpful for others to offer insight as well. stay positive , as awful as it seems , the good news is you know what you have to deal with and that beats not knowing any day of the week. best to you t",

During the day, all bets are off, it could be an hour , 2 hours , maybe 3, depends on activity. am I standing, walking, sitting...How much coffee did I drink, all that. I asked the Doc about this and he didn't seem concerned he was more concerned about being dry and being able to stay dry. Can I hold it \" ? If I feel the urge, I' m going next opportunity. I don't care if it's 45 min, but I can hold it if I need to. IF I understood the conversation correctly, my bladder after many years of BPH may not bounce back so maybe 3, 3 1/2 hours, maybe I can get to 4, will be the new reference , of which I am fine with. I am cutting back on drinks that are diuretics, such as coffee and Ice Tea. Not cutting them out, cutting them back. Regardless though, I have improved over the last few weeks to the point where I really don't need a pad other than a false sense of dependence. Last week I just stopped using them. Yeah a small spot now and then but nothing overwhelming. Wishing you the best. t",

Then, if all is well, once a year. I was told that anything reported .2 or above may require attention. We talked about many things, incontinence being one. I have never had an issue of WET at night and the stress incontinence during the day is less and less each week. Several weeks back I stopped using any pads at night and this week I have started with NO pads during the day. A very minimal drop now and then. I do understand that if I am doing any assertive work it would be good to use a thin pad. Regarding ED, still not woke up but sensations are there , something is going on, I can feel it waking up. I am now cleared to use 100 MG of Viagra (Sildenafil) , lets see what happens. Even though I was expecting to be a member of Club Zero, it is still a relief to hear the words and learn the results.

I recall I had one incision that was a pain, somewhat, and it took easily 6 weeks for it to diminish. Wile I am not a Dr, how we move around during the day, how much activity, the kind of activity etc all matters. Sleeping positions etc...As long as you are reporting this to the Doc and he or she is not concerned right now, just take it slow. Your recover may just take longer than others. there are no hard and fast rules here. Just take it easy. G O S L O W best to you t",

      "Content": "Hi Owen, being in a very similar situation right now, I am going forward with surgery. I had two early detection positive cores out of 12, Gleason 3+3=6 ( 10%) and Gleason 4+4=8 (15%). it's the Gleason 8 that is the defining factor . Is surgery the only option ? No of course not. At age 69 my wife and I are in 100% agreement that the best solution for me, is indeed surgery. We can live with the outcome and lifestyle changes, whatever they may be. The decision for which treatment you select needs to fit your plans for life going forward. Can we be ok with cells still in our body or can we feel more relieved with them gone and deal with some other things ? It's not an easy decision. One thing is for certain, Gleason 7 is right on the cusp, Gleason 6 is below the cusp , a treatment decision is required. For me it was personally not a hard decision , surgery scheduled for Nov 21 . Learning and knowing what the effects and schedule of radiation treatments are from the your Doc vs the removal and it's effects are paramount. Which treatment better serves your life style ? The good news is both can be very successful going forward. Each of us are different and each treatment will effect each of us differently. I have a handful of very close friends who opted for surgery and all are doing just fine, two of them are over 10 years now and adjusted well. One friend who opted for radiation is still dealing with some on going issues, but he as well is over 10 years. Two friends had the treatments at age 55, they are both closer to my age now, over 10 years. The one thing we all must keep in mind is with radiation treatment we know we still have cells inside us that we are hopeful to eliminate over time, with the surgery we are hopeful that after surgery our bad cells are in the trash can. We pray for an excellent post surgery NEGATIVE lab report. Then we live with the post surgery circumstances. You have excellent options available, regardless if it is Radiation or Surgery. The option that best fits your life style going forward , what to expect, whats involved, will be the determining factor. wishing you the absolute best tony",

The bad news and the good news is you have learned you have the C, so now all you have to do is select a treatment that best suits you lifestyle going forward. While it is certainly true that many select surgery, it is also true that a seasoned DOC is what you want. One with hundreds if not thousands of surgery's under his or her belt. Should you select surgery. One of the main items often not mentioned with regard to surgery is the % of patients that come out with \"CONFINED TO THE PROSTATE\" results, which means no more C breeding inside. That doesn't suggest that surgery is the better treatment but it may suggest that removing it from our body and not requiring further treatments or meds, is a welcomed relief, regardless of the AFTER effects. The emotions associated with \"C\" being gone cannot be overlooked. Learning that you have a single G7 has a great deal to do with the type of treatment you select, especially at your age. It suggests CONFINED which is also a primary reason why many URO's would recommend surgery. The ultimate goal is Cancer free. That is first and foremost. Dealing with after effects is not the same as dealing with a Cancer treatment. What I do feel all URO'S will agree with ,or at least should, is that your G7 will will indeed turn into a G8 or worse. Right now, a quality URO is looking at treating a single G7 with the best possible outcome . THAT IS THEIR CHARGE. Thats what is in front of them right now. Nothing else.

Thats not a bad thing. Surviving and treating Prostate Cancer is GOOD thing and never lose sight of that. Peeing into a Depends is nothing in the scheme of things if C is eliminated and removed from your body. I am an advocate of any treatment that fits a persons desires, I don't say select one over another, I do say select one and don't look back.

      "Content": "I thought I would offer an update for those that are in the post surgery healing process. A reference so to speak. I am now 10 weeks post , I feel great, no physical issues what-so-ever. The incisions are totally healed it seems, they are small scars now. I got rid of Depends about 2 or 3 weeks ago and am back to Haynes briefs, but still use a pad. Although there really is not overwhelming activity on the pad, minimal. The leaking during the day is still there, minimal, but still there. Mostly when standing from a sitting position or from excessive activity. Compared to 3,4 , 5 weeks ago it's like night and day. Plus I refuse to give up my two cups of coffee each morning which I am sure is contributing. My night time is 100% dry and has been since the surgery. The amount of time I get up to go to the bathroom has increased from about every two hours to just about 4 hours. This is huge for me. I have not slept 4 hours straight for the last 7 or 8 years due to BPH. Maybe I can get to 5 hours.... I walk at least 1/2 mile each day doing kegels as a I walk. My diet is still lean on carbs although I cheat. I lost 13 pounds pre-surgery and would like to keep that weight off. I was 20 pounds overweight at 188 now I am in the 175 range. regarding ED, still not active but things are happening. I am on 20 MG sildenafil daily, I expect that to be raised to 50 soon. I have sensation. I can feel it waking up. I am still 4 weeks away from my first post op PSA. We are all expecting zero, thats the plan. My daily routines are back 100% but I am aware that I have a pad in the Haynes. I am not afraid to use the restrooms wherever I may be. The stream is excellent , unlike the last 7 or 8 years of inconsistent weak stream due to BPH . It's a relief. If I was arrogant I would say the surgery was worth this alone, but I'm trying not to be arrogant anymore. Life on the other side of cancer surgery is different than the life PRE Surgery. I take nothing for granted, The things that bothered me in life before have zero significance in the scheme of things. The things I took for granted now have 100% significance. To be told that we have cancer is a tuff deal, a hard pill to swallow. But with the proper Dr's , treatments and support , it becomes like a fresh start, a reset so to speak. I clearly am not afraid of tomorrow. If my proposed time here on earth is 15 more years then it will be filled with 15 years of positive days with appreciation for my family ,friends and surroundings. best to all, stay the course, stay positive. t",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another I'd wait on the injections. I had adverse effects. Erection recovered on its own in 12 to 18 months. Cialis had an effect when sildenafil did not. While I have read many instances where this has occurred , after visiting with two PRE Injection therapists, it is not uncommon but not very common either. It can be corrected. There are a few factors to take into consideration, one being the actual injection and injection site, the other is the TRI MIX. I have been advised by both PRE visits that the TRI MIX blend itself can cause some issues and can easily be corrected. One mix is not the same for each person. One dose is not the same for each person, thats why it is a compound blend , it is specific to the person. The starting point of the blend may be the same but the final blend will vary. I don't start until next week after I see the PA. The Compound Pharmacist is also involved, they want to know how it all went down, was there pain, was there sensation ,was there no response, too much response , many questions. It's not just inject and go. Where the injection takes place is also critical, not difficult but must be in the right \"zone\". I was told that approx 20% of men have a reasonably good reaction with the initial mix at .2 Inj , but 80% need a higher Inj volume or re-mix to zero it in. There is indeed one element of the compound which can cause some pain and maybe a reaction, that ingredient goes down while one of the others goes up. The Pharmacist Consult told me the plan is to adjust the mix so the Inj volume can remain low. It's a balance thing , he works with the DOC , he is part of the team. He is not working the counter at Walgreens, he is specific. Every script they fill is based on each individual , consult is part of their charge. In our home, we know about these Compound Pharmacy folks and blends really well, my wife has been on hormone blends for a few years now. It took a few months for it all to work out but after that it was like taking an aspirin. While it is true that some men don't respond to injections it is also true that many do. There are way too many factors to state that it doesn't work or why it doesn't work. Health, physical cond, age etc... I asked the Doc about Sildenafil vs Cialis, actually two Docs, both said the same thing, they are basically one and the same, one has a higher dosage than the other. They both have the exact same purpose, blood flow. Again, it's back to each person is different , each of us respond differently to different meds. Health, physical cond, age etc... What may work for person A may have zero effect for person B. Regarding long term, I was told that near half the men who take injections, it's possible that over a year or so period, ED will cure on it's own. But no guarantees. It's worth the effort to try. I certainly have read the accounts where it was painful and didn't work, but I have also read the accounts that were just the opposite. Will it work for me ? Will I have reactions ? Can't say, but it's sure worth a try.",

Yes, my wife and I are trying hard not to dwell on the procedures and are already focused on AFTER, I already have my two post op dates which is good, it allows looking past the procedure. I know this, I am better off knowing it was detected and knowing I have it rather than walking around undetected and not knowing I have it, thinking everything is fine. I feel I have a very high threshold for pain and procedures, I'm now looking forward to Nov 17, which is the day after . thx all tony",

      "Content": "I thought I would offer an update for those that are in the post surgery healing process. A reference so to speak. I am now 10 weeks post , I feel great, no physical issues what-so-ever. The incisions are totally healed it seems, they are small scars now. I got rid of Depends about 2 or 3 weeks ago and am back to Haynes briefs, but still use a pad. Although there really is not overwhelming activity on the pad, minimal. The leaking during the day is still there, minimal, but still there. Mostly when standing from a sitting position or from excessive activity. Compared to 3,4 , 5 weeks ago it's like night and day. Plus I refuse to give up my two cups of coffee each morning which I am sure is contributing. My night time is 100% dry and has been since the surgery. The amount of time I get up to go to the bathroom has increased from about every two hours to just about 4 hours. This is huge for me. I have not slept 4 hours straight for the last 7 or 8 years due to BPH. Maybe I can get to 5 hours.... I walk at least 1/2 mile each day doing kegels as a I walk. My diet is still lean on carbs although I cheat. I lost 13 pounds pre-surgery and would like to keep that weight off. I was 20 pounds overweight at 188 now I am in the 175 range. regarding ED, still not active but things are happening. I am on 20 MG sildenafil daily, I expect that to be raised to 50 soon. I have sensation. I can feel it waking up. I am still 4 weeks away from my first post op PSA. We are all expecting zero, thats the plan. My daily routines are back 100% but I am aware that I have a pad in the Haynes. I am not afraid to use the restrooms wherever I may be. The stream is excellent , unlike the last 7 or 8 years of inconsistent weak stream due to BPH . It's a relief. If I was arrogant I would say the surgery was worth this alone, but I'm trying not to be arrogant anymore. Life on the other side of cancer surgery is different than the life PRE Surgery. I take nothing for granted, The things that bothered me in life before have zero significance in the scheme of things. The things I took for granted now have 100% significance. To be told that we have cancer is a tuff deal, a hard pill to swallow. But with the proper Dr's , treatments and support , it becomes like a fresh start, a reset so to speak. I clearly am not afraid of tomorrow. If my proposed time here on earth is 15 more years then it will be filled with 15 years of positive days with appreciation for my family ,friends and surroundings. best to all, stay the course, stay positive. t",

The Surgeon, is very well known, very detailed, he does this with each and every patient . It's not based on lab tests or anything else rather than he is very complete. Learn whats going on before, rather than later . The nurse told me the whole thing takes about 5 min . The thought of it is , well, I can't actually think about it.

When the Nurse told me she was pulling the Catheter out , she said it will be on 3...I counted, 1,2 she had already pulled it out before I got to 3. No pain just a weird sensation for 2 or 3 seconds. I didn't drop much urine, a very small amount . Don't worry they got you covered, they are prepared and will give you what you need. I put on the Depends with an extra pad and went home, maybe a 45 min drive. I never had an issues with pee'ing, I always felt the urge and was able to get to the toilet in time. It was the leaking that was the most annoying. As stated above, don't judge control by days, judge it by weeks. I am now 6 months post and the leaking is pretty much totally gone. I do drop a spot now and then with physical activity but even that is getting less and less. Just give it all time, don't try to rush things. At home you need a pack or two of Depends and maybe the extra heavy pads. We bought too many and returned them. By 3 months I went to Haynes Briefs with a lite-duty pad. t",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another I'd wait on the injections. I had adverse effects. Erection recovered on its own in 12 to 18 months. Cialis had an effect when sildenafil did not. While I have read many instances where this has occurred , after visiting with two PRE Injection therapists, it is not uncommon but not very common either. It can be corrected. There are a few factors to take into consideration, one being the actual injection and injection site, the other is the TRI MIX. I have been advised by both PRE visits that the TRI MIX blend itself can cause some issues and can easily be corrected. One mix is not the same for each person. One dose is not the same for each person, thats why it is a compound blend , it is specific to the person. The starting point of the blend may be the same but the final blend will vary. I don't start until next week after I see the PA. The Compound Pharmacist is also involved, they want to know how it all went down, was there pain, was there sensation ,was there no response, too much response , many questions. It's not just inject and go. Where the injection takes place is also critical, not difficult but must be in the right \"zone\". I was told that approx 20% of men have a reasonably good reaction with the initial mix at .2 Inj , but 80% need a higher Inj volume or re-mix to zero it in. There is indeed one element of the compound which can cause some pain and maybe a reaction, that ingredient goes down while one of the others goes up. The Pharmacist Consult told me the plan is to adjust the mix so the Inj volume can remain low. It's a balance thing , he works with the DOC , he is part of the team. He is not working the counter at Walgreens, he is specific. Every script they fill is based on each individual , consult is part of their charge. In our home, we know about these Compound Pharmacy folks and blends really well, my wife has been on hormone blends for a few years now. It took a few months for it all to work out but after that it was like taking an aspirin. While it is true that some men don't respond to injections it is also true that many do. There are way too many factors to state that it doesn't work or why it doesn't work. Health, physical cond, age etc... I asked the Doc about Sildenafil vs Cialis, actually two Docs, both said the same thing, they are basically one and the same, one has a higher dosage than the other. They both have the exact same purpose, blood flow. Again, it's back to each person is different , each of us respond differently to different meds. Health, physical cond, age etc... What may work for person A may have zero effect for person B. Regarding long term, I was told that near half the men who take injections, it's possible that over a year or so period, ED will cure on it's own. But no guarantees. It's worth the effort to try. I certainly have read the accounts where it was painful and didn't work, but I have also read the accounts that were just the opposite. Will it work for me ? Will I have reactions ? Can't say, but it's sure worth a try.",

This forum has been a real inspiration and help to both my husband and I over the past 10 weeks and I know will continue to do so. I hope this update will be of similar assistance to you and your loved ones during your journey. We were blessed to have a great team who were very detailed before the operation. My husband was the third surgery for his surgeon for the day so, the actual surgery began at approx. 1:00 in the afternoon. The surgeon greeted me at 5:10 pm and told me that my husband tolerated the surgery very well and while the final pathology report (due out on Monday) should confirm his diagnosis he saw nothing that would suggest that the cancer spread outside of the prostate and feels good that it remained contained. He also downgraded one of his positive cancer spots from an 8 to a 7. My husband was moved from recovery to his room within 2 hours. Within an 1-1/2 hours they let me sit with him. Do take note not to be alarmed at the very short term swelling to the face that occurs immediately after surgery. That is due to your head being tilted back during surgery which causes fluids to settle in the head and face. This is normal and within a few hours goes away. There is also a small balloon type drain attached to the his side which drains the blood that has collected where the operated. The belly is also very swollen immediately after surgery (but again - nothing to be alarmed about) simply a heads up to your wife/family to be aware of. My husband was coming in and out of the sedation and by 11:00 Pm was very aware. It is now 7:00 am (next day) and I am heading back to the hospital to be with the greatest husband in the world (had to come home last night to let Homer the cat in the house). I would be lying to you to say that I am not dog tired - so loved ones due rest up before the surgery. I think it is the body finally relaxing after 10 long weeks of wait. Spoke with my husband this morning - yes he called me at 5:45 am and he sounds very alert and while his IV is still pushing a very mild pain med. He said he is not in any pain. The only complaint right after surgery he had and I think you can guess what it is was the catheter. It was not painful - just uncomfortable and making him feel like he had to go. Well, I'm off to the hospital. My thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you about to take this journey.

      "Content": "Interesting read, here is my point of view. I was diagnosed back in Sept, I was not shocked, but certainly alarmed. I had been seeing the urologist for near a decade with BPH, watching my PSA for years, then it decided to rise maybe 24 or 18 months ago. The biopsy revealed the nasty C word but the urologist has been preparing me for the C word and the possibilities for years. Certainly hearing the word then learning you have it are two different things, but it should not be a shock if we have been seeing a Doc for the last many years for testing. A huge disappointment ? sure... I opted for surgery, I'm 69, not 49 , not 59. Age is a major factor. I, like mentioned above , wanted it OUT of me. there is only one way to do that. Additionally, once radiation treatments are selected and begin, we cannot go back to surgery should the need arise. I am not PRO surgery, I am not PRO Robot technology, I am PRO getting rid of Cancer. My decision came from multiple facets, including a couple of friends who had surgery and some who did not have surgery.The ones who did had rather fast recoveries and the ones who didn't had continued visits to the Dr over a few years, one close to 10 years of treatments . He did not qualify for surgery but wished he did. I selected surgery well before I even knew of this forum. This is not a PRO surgery site, not by any stretch, it's an ANTI Cancer site. Each of us are different, we are different ages, we have different life styles, we have different bodies and we have different desires long term, shy of we all wanna live another 10 , 15 years or longer. The first question I asked my urologist before I even talked to a surgeon was , what would you do ? He said, I'm 70, I'de get the dang thing out of me into a trash bucket. We talked several options but for me and my wife, at my age, my health, getting it out of my body was first and foremost if I could somehow make that happen. When we met with the surgeon we discussed several options, he didn't push surgery , he's also an oncologist, he gave me the options and stats which best fit my desire. When I learned that surgery was no longer an option should treatments not be fully successful, thats where my wife and I both said at the same time, Surgery, remove the prostate, remove the cancer if it's possible. Of course many people decide on treatments for various reasons , I seriously doubt anyone chooses surgery because theres a robot guiding the hand of the surgeon. We each have prostate cancer, something we never asked for , it's a very scary time. We make a decision and we go with it. We want it out, gone, cured, call it whatever you want. We need to trust the Dr's 100% and then not second guess. Radiation or surgery may very well be 100% great for one person, but 100% wrong for another. We are all different, we will each heal differently, we will each react to treatments differently. We become stats. Whatever treatment anyone decides to select, I support them 100% . Don't select surgery because I did, select the treatment that best fits your desires and life style over the next many years. best to all t",

      "Content": "Jake, glad to hear you made it thru and the catheter is out. By the way , I am not a DR , I just have an opinion here and there. We all react differently and heal differently, so don't be alarmed, you just had major invasive surgery even if we describe it as 'it was nuthin\" ! The leaking will be with you for a bit, directly after surgery I had leaking when standing or excessive movement during the day. I was fortunate as I was 100 % dry at night and I was able to start regular peeing soon after surgery but the leaking still occurred. It gradually got better over time, not days but rather weeks. I feel we have to train ourselves with this new phenomenon , sudden movements, getting up from sitting etc... we need to be aware. I believe after maybe 2 months things were noticeably improved. Daily walking with Kegel exercise was a big help. In addition, our daily eating and drinking habits must also change, limited fluids , the type of fluids we take in etc, late in the day and evenings can go a long way towards night time continence. At 6 months now, my daily schedule for peeing is \"known\". I am at about 3 hours between pee session unless I am drinking coffee ( 2-3 cups each AM) which I am not giving up. I'll learn to deal with it. The leaking is really down to minimal now , even over the last month or two there has been improvement, even with lots of physical activity. I am very lite on fluids though, I drink water but not the whole bottle, I nurse it. I believe after a period of healing ( probably 4,5 or even 6 months) we can self regulate how things go. We can't rush this. We feel great on the outside but our bladder and surrounding area knows something big happened. Just give it time, settle in on what your body is doing, it will get better. Learn how much fluids and what types of fluids you can take without consequence. My first PSA was 3 months post, < 0.1 undetectable, my 2nd PSA is in 2 weeks. regarding ED, same as above, give it time, you had nerves cut on both sides, this may take a while for them to heal and respond. I had nerve sparring on one side and nerves cut on the other side. Currently I have feelings and sensations but nothing to write hoe about,. Viagra ( 100 MG ) is not working for me at this time. I recently had injection therapy with mild success and will continue with this going forward, but it is a long process. Patience is required. A good friend of mine why is also cured of Prostate cancer puts all of this stuff another way...the side effects are what they are and known, but they sure beat the \"OTHER SIDE EFFECT\" which we can't ever return from, and thats the entire point of Prostate Cancer treatments, get rid of the cancer so we can carry on for another decade or two...or longer. Wishing you the best , rest up, enjoy your life ! t",

      "Content": "ANWANK , you are both very fortunate to have each other. That in itself is a blessing. I am now 3 months POST surgery . My wife has been with me every step of the way, it's like we both had PC but only one of us needed the surgery. It will take about 6 to 8 weeks of CURE time to get back to normal physical activity, do not let him begin activities too early. The time up to that point is healing and is really required . Don't push it. He may feel like doing workouts but his body will be saying otherwise. I had zero issues with incontinence , but as you know, there is what they call stress incontinence, he will have to learn how to deal with it . It's like a woman sneezing or coughing and they spot their underwear. It is annoying but it can be overcome with time and patience. For someone who is very active it's going to be a learning process and it may take a few months. ED is another thing, just be patient , things should get back to normal in time. Your husband , like most of us here , will notice improvements weekly once the catheter is removed post surgery. I could have easily began some normal activities 3 or 4 weeks out, I had no pains , I felt great, but my body was not ready for activities quite yet. At 10 weeks out I was doing everything I did PRE surgery , but with the activity will come the stress incontinence. At 12 weeks even that is winding down and getting less and less. But you have to be conscious of it . My wife is loving and caring, as you are . I am blessed to have her at my side . No different than you and your husband. We have been together 35 years. two words....patience and time. Just be there for him , stay positive. If you notice improvements, say so. wishing you the best t",

And yes, my wife has been with me every step of the way , I think she is more tired than I am. The amount of information we have taken away from this forum from others personal experiences, far exceeds anything I can give back. As we head towards surgery our minds can easily wander aimlessly and then after surgery the same thing. But reading the shared experiences puts much of that in check. Not that we are all going to react and recover the same, but knowing what others experienced and comparing to whats going on with me took a lot of guess work out of the equation during the Post Op recovery. Sure , my post op numbers look good, and that is a welcome relief, but the road ahead still has some obstacles that we will address. I am very grateful to all of those that shared experiences ahead of me as well as the positive support and I will continue to share \"my journey\" with others behind me. The #1 take away, we are not alone. We are in a common group, one we never expected or wanted to become part of. But yet, here we are.

      "Content": "DJIN, 10% of the tumor...(sample) not 10% of the prostate, but it was near the apex. The surgical path on the left side was 100% muscle sparring but on the right he cut wide. We knew this was going to be the case well ahead of surgery. In our discussion yesterday, the Surgeon commented that he personally downgraded the G8 to G7 at surgery but the post op path report left it at G8. I asked if this can be opinion based, he said yes, both ways. He also said that Lab reports can many times be very conservative . So G8 it remained. Also discussed was continence vs incontinence, probably the first question from the Doc was, \" are you dry at night \" answer is yes. I also reported that I can stop the stream and if I think about it before I stand up, I may be able to stop that really annoying leakage. I do kegels every day when I remember, a few times a day. The Doc also wanted to know about BM's, am I regular ? Answer is yes , every morning now just like pre surgery, and I am still taking two Stool Softeners each day and have no plans to stop. The BM thing in his opinion was really quite important for recovery. The Nurse told me that it's not uncommon for some men to have BM difficulty for many weeks post surgery, which presents additional problems. He looked at my incisions, then gently poked the one on the far right side and said, \"this one still hurts a little doesn't it \" , I said yeah ..when you poke it ! Otherwise the incisions are right on the healing schedule. My wife, ( big mouth) told them I was doing some very mild yard work, we are talking very mild, they told me to stop and wait another 2 or 3 weeks before doing any physical activity at all. Give it the full 6 or 7 weeks. I am on about a 2 hour pee window at night and that was a concern as I am not getting much sleep. This is how I lived for the last 8 years with BPH. He commented that my bladder has shrunk and that in time it will regain some additional size but it will never be like it was when I was 20. He reminded me that I am 69. The good news is that I am feeling the urge and able to get up and get over to the bathroom, I am not wetting and my pads at night are basically dry. During the day, standing is a bit different, I need to learn how to control the leaking which the Doc stated will improve everyday. He had my incontinence predicted at 10% post surgery , he thinks I am less than that and well on my way to near 100% control. . He calls the leakage a different deal, more related to healing post surgery. The body is trying to figure out what to do when I stand up. The kegels are very important with this , the stronger the muscle gets the better leakage control we will have. regarding ED, way too early to tell. Then as stated above, in 3 months we look at the PSA and should expect 0. At the next visit he said we will also review continence and ED for progress. If my progress is good and the PSA is zero, I most likely will not see him for a year , unless I call with concerns. I am still down about 13 pounds from ( Dr requested) when all this started several months back. The good news here is our eating habits have changed significantly, we have added some carbs back to the diet but limited and not everyday. One thing I shared with a friend yesterday, never take a BM or clear urine for granted. Following the appt I actually read the urine sample report, it was good reading, everything negative. Who woulda thought that reading a urine sample report would ever be of interest. So far so good, except for the annoying leaking.... best to all t",

      "Content": "So I am now 4 weeks post surgery and 18 days post catheter. My post op labs were all negative, the doc said I won the lottery with the \"fully contained in the Prostate\" report. I was never in any substantial pain and I never really needed any meds. I am doing pretty well with the continence, I was never 100% incontinent,I have never let it all go uncontrollable. I am still leaking a bit when standing but if I think about it I may be able to stop it before standing. At night, I get up every couple of hours with the urge and have no problem getting to the bathroom. I can now shower and dry off without leaking, I can hold it. I hate the leaking, it's a major annoyance. Kegels help. I wasn't expecting anything other than a Q+A and that is what we did, he went over the surgery, the post op lab report and we talked about the future. I have to return in 12 weeks for my first \"post non prostate\" PSA test, which he firmly believes will be 0. He asked me if I had an erection yet, I said no, but interestingly, I have some weird feelings down there, but I'm not sure what they mean. But then again, he said that if I answered YES he would have been very surprised as this is very early in the recovery process. He was very pleased with the progress as am I. I'm now on the 12 week countdown to hopefully 0 PSA. t",

This is one of the advantages of surgery because the surgeon/patient then know EXACTLY what was going on within the prostate as compared to the ESTIMATE offered by the clinical report (meaning the biopsy report). yes of course and I didn't mean to imply otherwise . And you are correct, this is one of the major benefits of surgery, we learn EXACTLY where we stand, first hand.",

      "Content": "All, I know my wife posted a message but I thought I would add some update. this morning is the 3rd morning Post Surgery , which was Tuesday at 1 PM. 2 nights in Hospital , not 1. Home yesterday around 3 pm. Feeling more alert this morning. Drinking a cup of my coffee. Wife is a real trooper,she is as tired as I am. No real pain, no meds needed, just some discomfort on one incision, the larger one on my right side. Its just tight. Taking Tylenol . First night home was awkward because we have the bag to deal with. Other than that not over whelming. Catheter stays in until next Fri, 7 more days. Going into Surgery ( Tues around 1 PM) was very strange, surreal, I was rolled in, I saw what I thought was the robot, I asked a question about it I think someone said yes, then I woke up in recovery. I asked how long I was there and they said a little over an hour. got to room around 7 PM, wife stayed until around 9 ish I think. First night , no issues, slept most of it I think. No pain, just a soar throat from the breathing tube. I do remember telling them in recovery that I had to pee, it just all didn't feel right, they kept telling me that I was peeing, it was the pressure from the catheter in the bladder.Felt very odd at the time but it went away shortly, maybe an hour or two. I remember I told them it felt like I needed to go stand by a tree and pee, it was urgent. 1st morning post, Wed am, they brought me liquid breakfast. I have not had real food now since Sun night. This is now wed AM. No solid food day before. Lots of IV's , I had real bad nausea for most of the day , then it went away. From the anesthesia they said, that stuff easily takes a day or more to exit our body. Started to have gas pains around this same time. They said I can go home once I pass gas and have a BM , for some odd reason I thought I would do that in this same 1st day, not gonna happen. Liquid lunch and liquid dinner. Nasty broth but no appetite anyway. Didn't start to pass gas until very late in the night into the early Am, had a liquid BM around 5 AM. Still no pains. I've been up and walking around the surgical recovery wing since the early afternoon, just real tired. I can get in and out of bed myself just trying to avoid disturbing the right side incision. The soar throat went away by the end of the day. 2nd morning Thanksgiving morning. Brought me real food, make that real fake food . Some sort of imitation pancakes with some other stuff. I ate a bit, drank some bad coffee and now was just pondering the day. Because I passed gas and had the BM they were saying I would go home . No pain, took out one of the IV's ,no meds. Did some walking around, watched some bad TV, waiting on staff Dr to come in which he did around 10 ish, checked my incisions, said they all looked good, answered a few questions, like 6 weeks to full physical recovery, Q and A about the catheter , showers and stuff. released me around 1, left around 2, home by 3. No word on post op labs yet, that will be early next week, Dr said all went well, expecting a good outcome. No pains this morning just trying to seek a routine , was able to lay on my side in bed , cat kept jumping on me. I doubt I will need those pain meds which I have as they told me everyday should get better, not worse. Just the one incision on the right side is stiff, tight, makes ya grimace if you tug it. I'm now counting the night's until next Fri for the Catheter removal 7 more nights. The nursing staff was amazing for my stay, just excellent and very caring, terrific people, I couldn't do what they do. They are a real blessing. So as of right now, I am 65 hours post surgery and I gotta say, you really need 48 hours in the Surgical rehab wing post surgery, if that means 2 nights or even more, fight the boredom , just do it. One extra night in Hospital will be a welcomed relief. I will report my post op labs as soon as I know them, Dr said he did have a slight issue reconnecting my bladder, his issue not mine, thats why 10 total days on catheter. He also said he down graded my G8 to G7 , but I was half out of it when he was talking to me. He did say he had to cut wide on the right, but we knew that going in. The left side was what he termed full sparing. So we'll see. Thx to all. this forum is a very positive place. t",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Actually, the removed prostate is taken to the lab where a pathologist sections it up and pretty much gives an EXACT pathology report (not a mild one) and sends it to the surgeon. This is one of the advantages of surgery because the surgeon/patient then know EXACTLY what was going on within the prostate as compared to the ESTIMATE offered by the clinical report (meaning the biopsy report). yes of course and I didn't mean to imply otherwise . And you are correct, this is one of the major benefits of surgery, we learn EXACTLY where we stand, first hand.",

      "Content": "welcome ! I can only add that it's better to learn early ( now ) if it is indeed PC , a high PSA is not an indicator of PC it is a flag to be checked for PC . We are assuming there is no PSA history over perhaps the last 5 or 6 years ? Even from a GP for a routine physical ? It would certainly be worthwhile to go back and request the records. These are not things we want to guess at, we want to know exactly what the numbers are. As stated, the URO is looking for an identified trend, not necessarily a high number. That being said, those of us who have experienced and been treated for PC, are somewhat familiar with the stats and reported stats. Just for comparison, At our age, 70 ish , the stats say a normal guy may be in the 4 to 4.5 range which can be an increase form 65 or 66 years old. That 4 to 4.5 may stick around for a few years. If there is no history then indeed the biopsy is required. I feel that any URO worth his or her salt would perform a bio regardless with a 9 + PSA. Its twice what the commonly accepted stat is for 70 years old. IF it's UCLA then great, but don't delay, the sooner the better. The great news is regardless, the treatments available or excellent , maybe some daily life altering habits but nonetheless , treatments are excellent with excellent results. early detection with a proactive attitude and plan is the key. Let us know best to you and you husband t",

No. What did it do for me ? I really don't know other than there is some sort of claim that it helps with BPH. My BPH symptoms remained steady for the last 6 or 7 years, weak stream, urge to go every couple of hours, or less. Did Saw Palmetto help with this ? (I'm sitting here shrugging my shoulders) My urologist said \"If you think it's helping then by all means keep taking it \" , so I did. I did not take the prescribed BPH meds, too many weird side effects for me. That all changed with an increased PSA and a positive biopsy. I am no longer a Saw Palmetto participant.",

Go to where you need to be as thats where you are going to end up anyway. I am puzzled a tad by a positive biopsy in Feb of this year and why you have not been to SEE a Urologist. Who did the biopsy ? This is now Nov. You don't need to communicate with a Urologist you need to be in the care of a Urologist. A PSA rising is not a sign of Cancer, it is a sign to be tested for Cancer. Your PSA is still rising, and you have other symptoms, your body is talking to you. STOP whatever you are doing with your family Dr. and get to a seasoned Urologist now. No disrespect implied. Then you can talk treatments that best fit you and your life style. You should address this now. It's not something that should scare you but it should concern you, take the proper action with the proper Dr and things can go very smoothly. I suspect another biopsy is in order to learn whats going on now, a year later, maybe even a cystoscope to check the bladder again. best to you t",

      "Content": "J... Thx for posting and I too am you wishing the best . Yes, evil side effects , but none that can't be overcome with patience and perseverance. I feel I was very much like you pre-surgery, I was not looking forward to it but I didn't dwell on it, all of a sudden 11/21 came and went. Like you and your wife, my wife and I just wanted it behind us , we both remained positive. Still are. We didn't tell many people that I had the dreaded C, just a few here and there. Even now, many don't know whats been going on over the last 3 or 4 months. Maybe I'll tell them, maybe I won't. If your Surgeon has prepared you and given you all the necessary up front info, there is no reason to NOT expect your recovery and post stats to be just as predicted. For us, the upcoming surgery was no longer the main event, our minds flew right past the surgery to the post op lab report. That was our focus, the post op path report . Fortunately for me, it was all negative. Even though that was expected and predicted, we still wanted to hear the words and read the report. For us, this was huge. Wearing a Depends for a few months now seemed insignificant in the scheme of things. Before you know it, it will be the 30th and it will be like the whole thing didn't take more than 5 or 10 seconds and you will be on the other side of the slope. I do pray that you have as good a Hospital staff that I did for my two night stay, they were just flat out awesome. We'll talk to you on the other side T",

      "Content": "murphyj, welcome , sorry to learn of your situation and I totally concur with what Highlander has stated. Biopsy is the only test to confirm PC, as it is the only LAB result based test. MRI, as stated ,can only identify locations to \"look and see\" , it is not a confirmation. G6 3+3 is known to be an AS monitoring situation especially with only 2 cores positive out of 12. For me personally as a REF point, I had a PSA rise from the 3's to the 4's to 6.5 in 18 months , at age 67. The first biopsy , once I exceeded a PSA of 5, came back two cores positive, G6 3+3 and G8 4+4. both less than 15%. I lost the lottery with that G8. The URO told me that I probably had G6 activity when my PSA was rising and one of them kept growing. Once I moved into the G8 category, treatment of some sort was required. I am now 6 months POST surgery which we opted for. For me, the best opportunity to rid my body of this nasty PC was surgery, so far so good. Remember though, for me, I am not advising anyone to follow my path. If there is any good news at all, it is that the PC has been identified by the biopsy . Many here have gone thru multiple biopsy's with no confirmation, even with a high/rising PSA . While of course this is not actually good news to learn that you have PC , but it is much better to know that it has been detected rather than NOT to have been detected. I personally know a few where it took near two years of testing to confirm PC with both MRI and multiple biopsy's. The earlier we know the better off we are. We have many excellent treatments available for a full cure, once detected early. I suspect that in your situation AS will be the course of action. Stay the course let us know how things are going for you. Wishing you the best t",

      "Content": "welcome ! I can only add that it's better to learn early ( now ) if it is indeed PC , a high PSA is not an indicator of PC it is a flag to be checked for PC . We are assuming there is no PSA history over perhaps the last 5 or 6 years ? Even from a GP for a routine physical ? It would certainly be worthwhile to go back and request the records. These are not things we want to guess at, we want to know exactly what the numbers are. As stated, the URO is looking for an identified trend, not necessarily a high number. That being said, those of us who have experienced and been treated for PC, are somewhat familiar with the stats and reported stats. Just for comparison, At our age, 70 ish , the stats say a normal guy may be in the 4 to 4.5 range which can be an increase form 65 or 66 years old. That 4 to 4.5 may stick around for a few years. If there is no history then indeed the biopsy is required. I feel that any URO worth his or her salt would perform a bio regardless with a 9 + PSA. Its twice what the commonly accepted stat is for 70 years old. IF it's UCLA then great, but don't delay, the sooner the better. The great news is regardless, the treatments available or excellent , maybe some daily life altering habits but nonetheless , treatments are excellent with excellent results. early detection with a proactive attitude and plan is the key. Let us know best to you and you husband t",

      "Content": "Interesting read, here is my point of view. I was diagnosed back in Sept, I was not shocked, but certainly alarmed. I had been seeing the urologist for near a decade with BPH, watching my PSA for years, then it decided to rise maybe 24 or 18 months ago. The biopsy revealed the nasty C word but the urologist has been preparing me for the C word and the possibilities for years. Certainly hearing the word then learning you have it are two different things, but it should not be a shock if we have been seeing a Doc for the last many years for testing. A huge disappointment ? sure... I opted for surgery, I'm 69, not 49 , not 59. Age is a major factor. I, like mentioned above , wanted it OUT of me. there is only one way to do that. Additionally, once radiation treatments are selected and begin, we cannot go back to surgery should the need arise. I am not PRO surgery, I am not PRO Robot technology, I am PRO getting rid of Cancer. My decision came from multiple facets, including a couple of friends who had surgery and some who did not have surgery.The ones who did had rather fast recoveries and the ones who didn't had continued visits to the Dr over a few years, one close to 10 years of treatments . He did not qualify for surgery but wished he did. I selected surgery well before I even knew of this forum. This is not a PRO surgery site, not by any stretch, it's an ANTI Cancer site. Each of us are different, we are different ages, we have different life styles, we have different bodies and we have different desires long term, shy of we all wanna live another 10 , 15 years or longer. The first question I asked my urologist before I even talked to a surgeon was , what would you do ? He said, I'm 70, I'de get the dang thing out of me into a trash bucket. We talked several options but for me and my wife, at my age, my health, getting it out of my body was first and foremost if I could somehow make that happen. When we met with the surgeon we discussed several options, he didn't push surgery , he's also an oncologist, he gave me the options and stats which best fit my desire. When I learned that surgery was no longer an option should treatments not be fully successful, thats where my wife and I both said at the same time, Surgery, remove the prostate, remove the cancer if it's possible. Of course many people decide on treatments for various reasons , I seriously doubt anyone chooses surgery because theres a robot guiding the hand of the surgeon. We each have prostate cancer, something we never asked for , it's a very scary time. We make a decision and we go with it. We want it out, gone, cured, call it whatever you want. We need to trust the Dr's 100% and then not second guess. Radiation or surgery may very well be 100% great for one person, but 100% wrong for another. We are all different, we will each heal differently, we will each react to treatments differently. We become stats. Whatever treatment anyone decides to select, I support them 100% . Don't select surgery because I did, select the treatment that best fits your desires and life style over the next many years. best to all t",

The Dr called this morning with excellent news, all clear, no evidence of cancer escaping the prostate. Everything is clear including all lymph nodes. Although I don't have a full detailed list of stats to share , the news itself is what we wanted to hear and what the Dr was expecting. He did tell me that the one G8 cell was still being assessed as G8 , so no downgrade. I asked about the PT score, he said PT2 which means the cells were contained in the prostate, organ confined. regarding recovery, all is well, almost feels to well. No pains, no meds, BM's approaching regular, appetite growing , incisions starting to itch. Catheter will be removed Fri, ( 2 days from now) which would be 10 days total. Urine is clear.

      "Content": "All, I know my wife posted a message but I thought I would add some update. this morning is the 3rd morning Post Surgery , which was Tuesday at 1 PM. 2 nights in Hospital , not 1. Home yesterday around 3 pm. Feeling more alert this morning. Drinking a cup of my coffee. Wife is a real trooper,she is as tired as I am. No real pain, no meds needed, just some discomfort on one incision, the larger one on my right side. Its just tight. Taking Tylenol . First night home was awkward because we have the bag to deal with. Other than that not over whelming. Catheter stays in until next Fri, 7 more days. Going into Surgery ( Tues around 1 PM) was very strange, surreal, I was rolled in, I saw what I thought was the robot, I asked a question about it I think someone said yes, then I woke up in recovery. I asked how long I was there and they said a little over an hour. got to room around 7 PM, wife stayed until around 9 ish I think. First night , no issues, slept most of it I think. No pain, just a soar throat from the breathing tube. I do remember telling them in recovery that I had to pee, it just all didn't feel right, they kept telling me that I was peeing, it was the pressure from the catheter in the bladder.Felt very odd at the time but it went away shortly, maybe an hour or two. I remember I told them it felt like I needed to go stand by a tree and pee, it was urgent. 1st morning post, Wed am, they brought me liquid breakfast. I have not had real food now since Sun night. This is now wed AM. No solid food day before. Lots of IV's , I had real bad nausea for most of the day , then it went away. From the anesthesia they said, that stuff easily takes a day or more to exit our body. Started to have gas pains around this same time. They said I can go home once I pass gas and have a BM , for some odd reason I thought I would do that in this same 1st day, not gonna happen. Liquid lunch and liquid dinner. Nasty broth but no appetite anyway. Didn't start to pass gas until very late in the night into the early Am, had a liquid BM around 5 AM. Still no pains. I've been up and walking around the surgical recovery wing since the early afternoon, just real tired. I can get in and out of bed myself just trying to avoid disturbing the right side incision. The soar throat went away by the end of the day. 2nd morning Thanksgiving morning. Brought me real food, make that real fake food . Some sort of imitation pancakes with some other stuff. I ate a bit, drank some bad coffee and now was just pondering the day. Because I passed gas and had the BM they were saying I would go home . No pain, took out one of the IV's ,no meds. Did some walking around, watched some bad TV, waiting on staff Dr to come in which he did around 10 ish, checked my incisions, said they all looked good, answered a few questions, like 6 weeks to full physical recovery, Q and A about the catheter , showers and stuff. released me around 1, left around 2, home by 3. No word on post op labs yet, that will be early next week, Dr said all went well, expecting a good outcome. No pains this morning just trying to seek a routine , was able to lay on my side in bed , cat kept jumping on me. I doubt I will need those pain meds which I have as they told me everyday should get better, not worse. Just the one incision on the right side is stiff, tight, makes ya grimace if you tug it. I'm now counting the night's until next Fri for the Catheter removal 7 more nights. The nursing staff was amazing for my stay, just excellent and very caring, terrific people, I couldn't do what they do. They are a real blessing. So as of right now, I am 65 hours post surgery and I gotta say, you really need 48 hours in the Surgical rehab wing post surgery, if that means 2 nights or even more, fight the boredom , just do it. One extra night in Hospital will be a welcomed relief. I will report my post op labs as soon as I know them, Dr said he did have a slight issue reconnecting my bladder, his issue not mine, thats why 10 total days on catheter. He also said he down graded my G8 to G7 , but I was half out of it when he was talking to me. He did say he had to cut wide on the right, but we knew that going in. The left side was what he termed full sparing. So we'll see. Thx to all. this forum is a very positive place. t",

      "Content": "DJIN, 10% of the tumor...(sample) not 10% of the prostate, but it was near the apex. The surgical path on the left side was 100% muscle sparring but on the right he cut wide. We knew this was going to be the case well ahead of surgery. In our discussion yesterday, the Surgeon commented that he personally downgraded the G8 to G7 at surgery but the post op path report left it at G8. I asked if this can be opinion based, he said yes, both ways. He also said that Lab reports can many times be very conservative . So G8 it remained. Also discussed was continence vs incontinence, probably the first question from the Doc was, \" are you dry at night \" answer is yes. I also reported that I can stop the stream and if I think about it before I stand up, I may be able to stop that really annoying leakage. I do kegels every day when I remember, a few times a day. The Doc also wanted to know about BM's, am I regular ? Answer is yes , every morning now just like pre surgery, and I am still taking two Stool Softeners each day and have no plans to stop. The BM thing in his opinion was really quite important for recovery. The Nurse told me that it's not uncommon for some men to have BM difficulty for many weeks post surgery, which presents additional problems. He looked at my incisions, then gently poked the one on the far right side and said, \"this one still hurts a little doesn't it \" , I said yeah ..when you poke it ! Otherwise the incisions are right on the healing schedule. My wife, ( big mouth) told them I was doing some very mild yard work, we are talking very mild, they told me to stop and wait another 2 or 3 weeks before doing any physical activity at all. Give it the full 6 or 7 weeks. I am on about a 2 hour pee window at night and that was a concern as I am not getting much sleep. This is how I lived for the last 8 years with BPH. He commented that my bladder has shrunk and that in time it will regain some additional size but it will never be like it was when I was 20. He reminded me that I am 69. The good news is that I am feeling the urge and able to get up and get over to the bathroom, I am not wetting and my pads at night are basically dry. During the day, standing is a bit different, I need to learn how to control the leaking which the Doc stated will improve everyday. He had my incontinence predicted at 10% post surgery , he thinks I am less than that and well on my way to near 100% control. . He calls the leakage a different deal, more related to healing post surgery. The body is trying to figure out what to do when I stand up. The kegels are very important with this , the stronger the muscle gets the better leakage control we will have. regarding ED, way too early to tell. Then as stated above, in 3 months we look at the PSA and should expect 0. At the next visit he said we will also review continence and ED for progress. If my progress is good and the PSA is zero, I most likely will not see him for a year , unless I call with concerns. I am still down about 13 pounds from ( Dr requested) when all this started several months back. The good news here is our eating habits have changed significantly, we have added some carbs back to the diet but limited and not everyday. One thing I shared with a friend yesterday, never take a BM or clear urine for granted. Following the appt I actually read the urine sample report, it was good reading, everything negative. Who woulda thought that reading a urine sample report would ever be of interest. So far so good, except for the annoying leaking.... best to all t",

The family Doc told him that with that low PSA he will never get Prostate cancer.

      "Content": "So I am now 4 weeks post surgery and 18 days post catheter. My post op labs were all negative, the doc said I won the lottery with the \"fully contained in the Prostate\" report. I was never in any substantial pain and I never really needed any meds. I am doing pretty well with the continence, I was never 100% incontinent,I have never let it all go uncontrollable. I am still leaking a bit when standing but if I think about it I may be able to stop it before standing. At night, I get up every couple of hours with the urge and have no problem getting to the bathroom. I can now shower and dry off without leaking, I can hold it. I hate the leaking, it's a major annoyance. Kegels help. I wasn't expecting anything other than a Q+A and that is what we did, he went over the surgery, the post op lab report and we talked about the future. I have to return in 12 weeks for my first \"post non prostate\" PSA test, which he firmly believes will be 0. He asked me if I had an erection yet, I said no, but interestingly, I have some weird feelings down there, but I'm not sure what they mean. But then again, he said that if I answered YES he would have been very surprised as this is very early in the recovery process. He was very pleased with the progress as am I. I'm now on the 12 week countdown to hopefully 0 PSA. t",

And yes, my wife has been with me every step of the way , I think she is more tired than I am. The amount of information we have taken away from this forum from others personal experiences, far exceeds anything I can give back. As we head towards surgery our minds can easily wander aimlessly and then after surgery the same thing. But reading the shared experiences puts much of that in check. Not that we are all going to react and recover the same, but knowing what others experienced and comparing to whats going on with me took a lot of guess work out of the equation during the Post Op recovery. Sure , my post op numbers look good, and that is a welcome relief, but the road ahead still has some obstacles that we will address. I am very grateful to all of those that shared experiences ahead of me as well as the positive support and I will continue to share \"my journey\" with others behind me. The #1 take away, we are not alone. We are in a common group, one we never expected or wanted to become part of. But yet, here we are.

      "Content": "Surgery was Nov 21, I have a thread running with my updates as well. Today is 8 days since. The Dr called this morning with excellent news, all clear, no evidence of cancer escaping the prostate. Everything is clear including all lymph nodes. Although I don't have a full detailed list of stats to share , the news itself is what we wanted to hear and what the Dr was expecting. He did tell me that the one G8 cell was still being assessed as G8 , so no downgrade. I asked about the PT score, he said PT2 which means the cells were contained in the prostate, organ confined. regarding recovery, all is well, almost feels to well. No pains, no meds, BM's approaching regular, appetite growing , incisions starting to itch. Catheter will be removed Fri, ( 2 days from now) which would be 10 days total. Urine is clear. OF course there are still a few common factors post surgery to deal with , but one step at a time is ok with me. previous post surgery thread https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...t-RALP-surgery best to all t",

      "Content": "murphyj, welcome , sorry to learn of your situation and I totally concur with what Highlander has stated. Biopsy is the only test to confirm PC, as it is the only LAB result based test. MRI, as stated ,can only identify locations to \"look and see\" , it is not a confirmation. G6 3+3 is known to be an AS monitoring situation especially with only 2 cores positive out of 12. For me personally as a REF point, I had a PSA rise from the 3's to the 4's to 6.5 in 18 months , at age 67. The first biopsy , once I exceeded a PSA of 5, came back two cores positive, G6 3+3 and G8 4+4. both less than 15%. I lost the lottery with that G8. The URO told me that I probably had G6 activity when my PSA was rising and one of them kept growing. Once I moved into the G8 category, treatment of some sort was required. I am now 6 months POST surgery which we opted for. For me, the best opportunity to rid my body of this nasty PC was surgery, so far so good. Remember though, for me, I am not advising anyone to follow my path. If there is any good news at all, it is that the PC has been identified by the biopsy . Many here have gone thru multiple biopsy's with no confirmation, even with a high/rising PSA . While of course this is not actually good news to learn that you have PC , but it is much better to know that it has been detected rather than NOT to have been detected. I personally know a few where it took near two years of testing to confirm PC with both MRI and multiple biopsy's. The earlier we know the better off we are.

      "Content": "Darius, interesting and excellent questions. First I would go to a Urologist who is also an Oncologist. Time to exit the family doc. if you haven't already. Go to where you need to be as thats where you are going to end up anyway. I am puzzled a tad by a positive biopsy in Feb of this year and why you have not been to SEE a Urologist. Who did the biopsy ? This is now Nov. You don't need to communicate with a Urologist you need to be in the care of a Urologist. A PSA rising is not a sign of Cancer, it is a sign to be tested for Cancer. Your PSA is still rising, and you have other symptoms, your body is talking to you. STOP whatever you are doing with your family Dr. and get to a seasoned Urologist now. No disrespect implied. Then you can talk treatments that best fit you and your life style. You should address this now. It's not something that should scare you but it should concern you, take the proper action with the proper Dr and things can go very smoothly. I suspect another biopsy is in order to learn whats going on now, a year later, maybe even a cystoscope to check the bladder again. best to you t",

      "Content": "J... Thx for posting and I too am you wishing the best . Yes, evil side effects , but none that can't be overcome with patience and perseverance. I feel I was very much like you pre-surgery, I was not looking forward to it but I didn't dwell on it, all of a sudden 11/21 came and went. Like you and your wife, my wife and I just wanted it behind us , we both remained positive. Still are. We didn't tell many people that I had the dreaded C, just a few here and there. Even now, many don't know whats been going on over the last 3 or 4 months. Maybe I'll tell them, maybe I won't. If your Surgeon has prepared you and given you all the necessary up front info, there is no reason to NOT expect your recovery and post stats to be just as predicted. For us, the upcoming surgery was no longer the main event, our minds flew right past the surgery to the post op lab report. That was our focus, the post op path report . Fortunately for me, it was all negative. Even though that was expected and predicted, we still wanted to hear the words and read the report. For us, this was huge. Wearing a Depends for a few months now seemed insignificant in the scheme of things. Before you know it, it will be the 30th and it will be like the whole thing didn't take more than 5 or 10 seconds and you will be on the other side of the slope. I do pray that you have as good a Hospital staff that I did for my two night stay, they were just flat out awesome. We'll talk to you on the other side T",

      "Content": "murphyj, welcome , sorry to learn of your situation and I totally concur with what Highlander has stated. Biopsy is the only test to confirm PC, as it is the only LAB result based test. MRI, as stated ,can only identify locations to \"look and see\" , it is not a confirmation. G6 3+3 is known to be an AS monitoring situation especially with only 2 cores positive out of 12. For me personally as a REF point, I had a PSA rise from the 3's to the 4's to 6.5 in 18 months , at age 67. The first biopsy , once I exceeded a PSA of 5, came back two cores positive, G6 3+3 and G8 4+4. both less than 15%. I lost the lottery with that G8. The URO told me that I probably had G6 activity when my PSA was rising and one of them kept growing. Once I moved into the G8 category, treatment of some sort was required. I am now 6 months POST surgery which we opted for. For me, the best opportunity to rid my body of this nasty PC was surgery, so far so good. Remember though, for me, I am not advising anyone to follow my path. If there is any good news at all, it is that the PC has been identified by the biopsy . Many here have gone thru multiple biopsy's with no confirmation, even with a high/rising PSA . While of course this is not actually good news to learn that you have PC , but it is much better to know that it has been detected rather than NOT to have been detected. I personally know a few where it took near two years of testing to confirm PC with both MRI and multiple biopsy's. The earlier we know the better off we are. We have many excellent treatments available for a full cure, once detected early. I suspect that in your situation AS will be the course of action. Stay the course let us know how things are going for you. Wishing you the best t",

      "Content": "Tim, thx for the report. Sounds like you are improving nicely ! The wetting at night is indeed incontinence but the leaking during the day while walking or coughing etc may not be considered incontinent. As it was explained to me it is more related to physical muscle control which we never had to do before. This is typical and normal following surgery and from what I am learning may last as long as a year to some degree. Regarding your night time control, thats great news as that is really what the Dr's are looking for, control at night while sleeping, not emptying the bladder uncontrolled. DRY at night. Perhaps the medical term is still incontinence but what your are experiencing is very common and part of our internal healing process as well as our \"new\" awareness control. Our wives cough and sneeze, and drop a spot of pee...thats what woman do . Now, we as men following surgery may do the same thing as we now use the same muscles that our wives do. Now this sounds nasty, but my wife reminded me that she sometimes changes underwear a couple of times a day and has for her entire life. Coughing, sneezing, laughing....I don't know what to call that. I am now 6 weeks post surgery, for me the good news is I never wet at night or emptied my bladder uncontrolled. In the early days following catheter removal when I had the urge , I only had moments to get to the bathroom or I would not be able to maintain control. Now 6 weeks later this is not an issue. Regarding leaking or small drips. YES , if I stand quickly or do something strenuous , I will leak. It's getting better but it's still an annoyance. If I think about it before I make a \"move\" I may be able to prevent it. Now I'm not a Dr but this , according to those who I have asked , they say this is not incontinence but rather weak muscles and awareness. It's very common and can last a good while, maybe a year. Regular Kegels do indeed help with this. My last visit to the Dr two weeks ago he really only cared about being dry at night, the slight leaking/dripping was an artifact of learning how to control with just our rear muscles. He expects it to diminish over the following months as I learn how to use my muscles. KEGELS is the key here. If you are not fully emptying your bladder uncontrolled, you are not incontinent. If you can stop the stream, hold it and get to the bathroom, you are on the other side of the curve. That annoying leaking thing, well, we have to learn how to work around it . Some of us will gain control of it earlier than others. We now have to be aware, something we never had to do before. My wife and I had lunch with a good friend and his wife yesterday, he had surgery 1 year ago. We talked a little about the leaking and dripping . His wife put it into perspective in a very short sentence. \"We as woman have been doing that our whole lives\" ! Kinda put it into perspective. My friend , over a year now, does have a drip or two if he does something strenuous or physical . It's not an everyday occurrence but it is still on the radar.",

While I didn't have any total wetting issues ( unloading the bladder) I had leakage and still do. This is 7 weeks now. The leakage is still more of an annoyance than anything. Not at night in bed and not while sitting , but rather when I stand up or start to move around. But It's getting better each week . I can tell the difference. I would say it's too early to gauge your \"system performance\" , especially so close to the catheter being removed. Give it a few weeks before you start to take notes, Mr Catheter and Mr Bladder are not friends and MR Bladder may take some time to get over the invasion. I believe the first reference we are looking for is how we are doing at night ? Are you getting the urge and attempt to get to the bathroom in time or does the bladder just empty itself with no warning , no feeling, it just happens. ? One is incontinence the other is just really weak muscle control. We know we gotta hold it but can't, YET. Kegels really do help with this, don't ignore them. You could not do them with a catheter. Now you can. Personally I have found for me ,that when I walk ( at least 1/2 to 1 mile a day ) doing the kegels at this time is the best. I can concentrate on the squeeze and hold . This is real world . Getting up and moving around is really the only time I have any undesired annoying leakage. Although I am 7 weeks post surgery I am 6 weeks post catheter. It just takes time and understanding how to deal with our new circumstances. Our new life, it seems we have to plan our moves and prepare for them. I have also come to learn that while wearing either the Depends or Briefs ( with a pad) I try to keep the little fella pointed UP , this helps immensely. This week I graduated from Depends to Haynes Briefs. I still use the pads and my wife gave me some of her thin pads to use as a side shield , as a precaution. It's all a learning and experimenting game until I can gain full control of the annoying leaking thing. Learn what works best. My wife reminds me that she \"spots\" everyday and has for her entire life. All woman do. They learn to live with it, now we have to as well. Of course I am not talking about excessive leakage but the occasional spotting. Give it some time, things will improve, we can't rush this stuff. Wish we could.

      "Content": "garrjim, welcome. I am one of your local friends and glad to be of support in any way that I can . Regardless of which treatment you select, the good news is you will begin a treatment plan and the cure. As you know, my situation was PSA rising over an 18 month period, 3.4 > 4.4 > 6.4. My first biopsy showed 2 spots out of 12, but there were probably more , 1/Gleason 6 and 1/ Gleason 8. The G8 was the deal killer in my case. My stats are listed below in my signature. I opted for surgery , no regrets. YES some side effects which are now going away quickly. I had no incontinence to speak of and the ED thing is being addressed now, 3 months post surgery. My physical recovery (incisions) was really right at 6 weeks but I felt like I could have gone back to regular physical activities earlier, I had no pains whatsoever. I was told 6 weeks, NOT LESS ! I had the catheter for 10 days so I limited myself to the house for those 10 days. Once the catheter was removed I started getting back to regular life, even went back to the first gig 4 weeks post surgery. We have the same Dr so I can say, based on my experiences, he was spot on every step of the way. Before surgery and after. He can be a tad dry and very direct, but we are not looking for a social director, we are wanting a Dr who is 100% focused on the task at hand. IF you can, go up to SETTINGS at the top right, edit your signature with your stats so that those replying can do an apples to apples comparison. We have tons of experience here and we are now part of an elite group, even though we didn't plan it. stay the course, stay in touch , you know where I am. t",

I am 7 weeks post catheter, zero incontinence . I even fired Mr Depends two weeks ago and invited My Haynes into my life ( with a day and night pad ). The leaking thing is getting less and less each day but still with me. I understand this can take 12 to 16 weeks to get back to a more normal process, remember we are still healing from a major invasive surgery inside, no matter how good we feel on the outside. Additionally, we have to LEARN how to control this , as before it was automatic, we didn't have to think about it. best to you t",

      "Content": "Surgery Nov 21, 2017. Just had the 2nd post surgery PSA, came back undetectable. Next PSA Sept /Oct. Never really had an issue with incontinence from the get go, lucky I guess . Day time stress leakage is really at a minimum, not zero but dang close, and thats with activity. A small spot now and then. I don't actually worry about what I eat or drink , I don't even think about it. I am a 2 to 3 cups of coffee each morning person so perhaps thats a contributing factor. ED , still in repair. We are trying a few different things to wake it up, the injections indeed work but I would prefer other methods, such as the troche viagra tabs. It's what we all call \"trial\" phase. All under Docs approvals of course. It may very well take another few moths or so, but it's a process. One thing I have learned from all players is we don't want to let it sit idle for a year or two without trying some form of treatments, even if they re not successful at first. It's a process. No surgery regrets whatsoever, my life is literally back on track . I now have 3 close friends going thru this madness since my surgery last Nov , one has chosen HIFU and the other two radiation. I pray they all have the same zero C results that I have. best to all t",

      "Content": "mikesimm, good news, go forward as the Doc says. Always good to receive good news ! I would like to know how things went after the catheter was removed if you don't mind sharing. Did you have low bladder volume due to slight constant dripping or did you have a full bladder fairly soon and have the urge to release ? How have you been progressing with incontinence , if any ? I ask as I am 3 weeks behind you, surgery was Nov 21, catheter out yesterday, 1st full followup in 3 weeks. I had an excellent clear post op lab report which was also very good to hear. The catheter has been out 1 full day, I am experiencing low volume draining which I read is pretty common, my bladder is not filling all the way, as it is draining, you can't have both. I was told to expect this for a few weeks before I can start to gain some relevance of control . I am able to stop the leakage if I know I'm leaking but heck, this is just day 1. How are you progressing with this if I may ask ? many thanks tpjames",

My first night home post catheter I thought something was wrong , but of course it was not. I was expecting my bladder to fill and I would have the urge to \"go\", but that never happened. It wasn't until the morning that I realized that I really had been \"going\" pretty much all the time by leaking small amounts throughout the afternoon and evening. My bladder was empty. I called the night support team early in the evening and they told me to drink more fluids and If I had the urge to go and couldn't , get over to the ER right away for a bladder scan. I think that both that support Dr and I missed that I had been passing urine all afternoon and that my bladder was indeed empty. I probably didn't give them the proper details. I am now just 2 days post catheter and it appears that while laying down in bed or sitting , there is a small amount of \"going\" , not much, minimal. But when I stand and go to the toilet, I am emptying the bladder. It will empty on its own so I better be prepared . The first night home I was pretty concerned, I thought I would fill the bladder and feel the urge to go, that didn't happen. It's still not happening but I can tell something is going on. I feel some pressure. Last night my wife asked me why I am getting up a few times, I just told her that I am trying to learn what the heck is going on. I'm trying to get a reference. I don't have any pains , it's more discomfort, some burning sensation. I am taking the meds for the spasms, heck why not. At this point, I am not even trying to stop the stream , but I think I can, to some degree. If I try a firm kegel squeeze my incisions pull so it's way too early to start that stuff with the tightest squeeze . I am starting mild squeezes though just to get into the routine. First things first, my follow up is in 3 weeks so we'll see if there is any progress by that time. This whole ordeal really is a take it slow, one thing at a time process that cannot be rushed along. It's so darn foreign , how would we know how to react to this stuff without others sharing ? We wouldn't. I was a baby and pee'd my pants, then went the next 65 years without peeing my pants, now I'm peeing my pants again. Hopefully it won't be long term. Best to you in your recovery, very grateful for your sharing and I expect many others are as well. t",

No incontinence but the slight leaking is still there with activity, long standing or walking. Night time is bone dry. I graduated to Haynes briefs with a kinda heavy pad and will soon go to my wifes thin pads. ED is much slower, things are happening, there is sensation, but I am only on 25 MG Sildenafil, I believe they will double it in 4 weeks when I do my first POST PSA.

      "Content": "This coming Tuesday will be 6 weeks post surgery. So far everything is going as expected and as discussed with the Doc pre surgery. I'm taking 1 Sildenafil 20 mg daily and 2 stool softeners daily. No other meds. Incontinence I guess really never occurred but I didn't know what to expect or how to define it. I have been 100 % dry at night since catheter removal, which is now just shy of 5 weeks. Thats the question the Doc and Nurses asked. Not about the leaking. Am I dry at night. I am not certain if leaking is called incontinence, maybe it is. I have a small amount of leaking when up and around but even thats getting better with more control each day. The kegels really help with this, it's like I have to retrain myself when getting up from sitting or walking around etc. I was hopeful that this week I would give up the Depends but I think I'll go another week, I know I'm close. I also don't want to get in the habit of depending on DEPENDS . They serve their purpose though. I would like to gain just a bit more walking around leaking control. I'm very close to briefs with a pad. I'm told that this can take a few months to really improve. My incisions for all practical purposes are healed. I'm cleared for physical activities but also told to be cautious. No pains , no tugging or pulling of the incisions. If I didn't know any better it's like the surgery never happened. BM's are 100% regular and I am on a 2 to 3 hour window of pee'ing. I can hold it no problem . I wish the 2 or 3 hours was 4 or 5 hours, I am told that this will take time. ED, I have not addressed this yet but I do know something is happening down there, I feel things happening . Not sure what, but something . Before the Surgery the Doc advised us of what to expect POST surgery for me, my circumstances. So far it's pretty much exactly what he said. I am still walking 1/2 to 1 mile each day and we have indeed changed our daily eating habits at home, very limited snacks and very limited carb side dishes, some meals no carb sides at all. I'm drinking water near 95% of the time now,extremely limited soft drinks and only two cups of coffee each morning. I dropped 13 lbs before the surgery , I wasn't more than 15 or 20 lbs overweight anyway, but dropping the weight I can say i really feel much better overall. Maybe another 5 pounds will be the goal. When all this began I weighed 188 , I'm 5'8\". I would like to see 170 as my normal weight. My next update will not be until beginning of March when I get my 1st PSA post surgery results. Until then, everyone be safe, stay calm, stay the course . Follow the Docs orders, select a treatment that best fits your life, don't look back , don't second guess. The entire point of each of the treatments is exactly the same. I am a part time musician and last week I resumed my regular gig schedule, I had no issues going to the gig, handling my gear or during the gig. I went to the restroom before and after the gig as I typically would do and all was well. I had no \"Uh Oh\" moments during the show. Post OP Life has returned. It's good to be back. Happy New year ! t",
