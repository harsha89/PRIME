      "Content": "Hello: I have always had health anxiety issues, and my doctor thinks I am worrying prematurely, but I need some broader perspective. I am 56 years old, and generally in excellent health. I have been a vegetarian since I was 13, and I exercise every day. In my most recent annual physical, my PSA came back at 3.8. It was 2.3 in my previous exam (which was actually 13 months ago, not 12). Over the previous few years, it had bobbled up and down, ranging from 2.1 to 2.8. My DRE is normal. There is no known history of PC in my family. Although my doctor did not comment on prostate size, I remember during an ER visit for a kidney stone a couple of years ago the ER doctor saying that my prostate looked \"really big\" on the CT scan, but I have never had any significant symptoms of BPH. Knowing that I am a worry-wart, my doctor ordered an immediate redo of the PSA, and it came back as 3.3--good news, seemingly, since that was a .5 drop in just one week. However, he also did a free PSA test, which came back at 15.5%. This was a new thing to me, so I started doing substantial research, and have ended up more confused and alarmed than before. There are many sites that indicate the risk of cancer at 20% or less for a free PSA percentage between 15 and 20. I know that means there is an 80% chance or more that it's NOT cancer at that level, but being me, I am focused on the 1-in-5 chance that it is cancer. Meanwhile, I have found many seemingly reputable sites that suggest a biopsy be performed if the %-free PSA is below 20, or even below 25. Here's my question: Does anybody have a sense of whether these figures (PSA 3.3, down from 3.8 a week ago, plus free PSA at 15.5%) would warrant a biopsy? Candidly, I have always enjoyed a vigorous sex life, and I am quite active. I must admit I am less scared of cancer than of the possible side effects of its treatment. Thanks.",
