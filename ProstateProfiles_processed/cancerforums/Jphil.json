      "Content": "Mrs. GG I am sorry you have to go through this, but it is good you are preparing and remaining positive. You will feel much better when surgery is over and you will find you don't think about it all the time like we tend to do leading up to treatment. It is great to get final pathology and know where he stands so the what-ifs don't take over. My husband had surgery the end of March, and I really believe we (as wives) can help them through this time and cheer them on. Being by his side will benefit him quite a bit. There are others here that definitely know a lot more than me about your husband's biopsy results. As far as PNI. My husband had a core that identified PNI and that was located in his Right Lat Base that had 80% involvement and one core in his Right Base that had 70% involvement. Both were 3+4=7 with gleason pattern 4 involving 10% of the specimens. He also had 3 other positive cores with less involvement that were gleason 6. Because the positive cores were on both sides and some had more involvement, I too was worried what final pathology would show. Fortunately, it was never upgraded and the tumor involved 7% and had not escaped. PNI was not mentioned on final pathology. His final results were better than we expected. As far as pads and guards, my husband only needed the Depend Maximum Absorbency Guards during his recovery at home. It was a waste to purchase the underwear because he only wore one home from the catheter removal appointment. He did fine with boxer briefs and the pads after that. When he went back to work he switched to the Tena Moderate because he said the Depend Maximum were way too bulky under his pants and he didn't need that much protection. He tried to move to the Depend Lighter Absorbency Shield, but they caused him irritation so he is still using the Tena Moderate. One Tena Moderate in the morning will last all day and is not very wet when he gets home. At night he can now go with no pads. They easily fit in his pocket if he had to change on during the day at work. While he was home recovering with the catheter in place, he just wore a pajama top and loose-fitting boxers (not boxer briefs till he went to pads). The baggy boxers had an open fly so he could check on catheter position easily and apply Vaseline or Neosporin at the catheter entry site. Check with your doctor. Some people think it is better to use something other than Neosporin. Everybody is different, and you will develop a routine for what works best for him. My husband slept in a recliner at night with the night bag next to him on the floor. During the day, he used the leg back and kept his feet elevated on a box because the recliner kept it too high and it should be below bladder level. It may help if you can assist him with the catheter bag emptying. An extra set of hands helps out with the bags, legs bands, etc. My husband is doing great. The only issue he had was a stricture, but he was treated and can do at home treatment, so we are hoping that will soon pass. Fortunately, I don't think strictures happen very often. Most of all, be there for support and encouragement. He will have up and down days. It is good you are dealing with this early.",

      "Content": "My husband had a stricture form about 4-5 weeks after surgery. He had developed a very thin stream for about a week with some spraying and dribbling at the end of urination and had noticed his stream had been gradually diminishing. He went to the doctor because he could not urinate. They dilated him at the office and sent him home with a catheter for one day. He was instructed to use a Urethral Meatal Dilator with Surgi-lube every other day for 1st month and then 2x a week until his follow-up PSA appointment (about 3 1/2 months post surgery). My husband wasn't sure if the stricture had formed again or not. He was urinating OK and the stream was not as thin as the first stricture, but he had to force the urine out when he was done because he felt there was some pressure. He just went to his follow-up appointment last week and the doctor said the stricture was still there, but not as bad as the first one, so he needed to be dilated in the office again. Doc said the pressure prevents the bladder from healing as it should. Now he has been instructed to use the self dilator every day for one month and then every other day for another month, and then 2x a week until next appointment. The doctor said it was likely caused by the catheter. After some searches this morning, I read that you should not use Neosporin after surgery at the catheter entry site because of a concern it could cause strictures. This was on a forum website, but I wondered if it is true. Has anyone heard this before? We had a couple sets of instructions from the hospital and one said Neosporin and one said Vaseline. In most cases my husband was using Neosporin several times a day. Now I am concerned that this may have had something to do with the formation of the stricture. What instructions were others given for catheter care after surgery to protect the meatus? I am hoping there is some consistent information so that others don't experience an issue. He was urinating well after catheter removal for about 2 weeks and was not using Neosporin or anything else, so possibly it had nothing to do with it. It also could have been just having the catheter in general because I did read on medical websites about strictures forming from the larger diameter catheters, and another factor, \"trauma\". I do recall the nurse telling me when I met them in my husband's hospital room after surgery that all went well, but he protested a lot about the catheter and let her know he didn't like it. He doesn't recall any of that and he is not a complainer, so I am thinking it must not have been very pleasant for him. I also remember when the catheter was in, it did appear that it pulled slightly to the side and didn't look like it was straight up and down. Maybe that had something to do with it too. Fortunately, from what I've read, strictures are supposedly rare occurrences. In any case, we are hoping he will not need another in-office dilation in the future and hoping that there is a way for others to avoid strictures. On a positive note, his follow-up PSA is zero and he is glad to have the surgery in the past!",

I didn't find much information about any, but went to the Da Vinci Surgeon Locator and found a Dr. John Burgers in Columbus, Ohio listed and he had good ratings on ratemds, vitals, and healthgrades. Does anyone think those site are valuable in helping to evaluate a surgeon other than also finding out how many surgeries he has done? Has anyone heard of Dr. Burgers?",

      "Content": "I had hoped my husband was a candidate for AS...in reality, he was not. My husband chose surgery, which he had done about 2 1/2 weeks ago and he is doing great. It was the best decision for him, and we are relieved it was caught early and had not spread. Many internet articles and much of the media love to say men will die of something else and that prostate cancer kills only older men. That is not true. I did some research about famous people dying of prostate cancer and some we've all heard of died young (50s and 60s). While the \"odds\" may say one thing, it is not a chance we wanted to take. We have so much peace of mind having this behind us and moving on. The time leading up to the surgery was stressful at times. We had a lot of confusion in deciding between radiation and surgery until we talked to our surgeon and some nurses and other people who knew of his experience and track record. That gave us quite a bit of encouragement. My husband's nurse on the first night in the hospital, told us her husband had surgery one week earlier by the same surgeon. He came highly recommended. Don't rush until you are confident with your choice of treatment and the performer of treatment. Make sure you research all your options until you can feel you've made the best decision. While there is no great treatment for prostate cancer, you need to pick the option that you are most comfortable with. As for your wife, I am sure she means well, but even as a Christian, she cannot assume you are healed...especially if the biopsy shows cancer. As a Christian, I would hope that she would also believe that maybe God has a purpose for you in this and perhaps you will be able to encourage others that will be traveling the same path you are. If she is a devout believer, ask her to pray that God would direct your decisions in your choice of treatment in whatever option you choose to deal with this cancer diagnosis. Talk to as many people as you can and do your research. I am sure you will come to the best decision.",

      "Content": "Wayne, You said your wife is a devout Christian and believes trusting in man instead of God is anti-biblical and would doom you. She insists on natural medicine and prayer. Forgive me, but seeking treatment and making intelligent, informed decisions is NOT anti-biblical and is not dishonoring God. How is seeking treatment trusting in man and not God? You can still seek treatment, find the best medical provider you can trust and trust the results to God and pray for a positive outcome and strength for your ordeal. I am a Christian wife and I don't believe there is anything wrong with seeking treatment. God gave us highly-skilled medical professionals and it is our responsibility to use their gifts to help us. The best thing your wife can do for you is help you make good, informed decisions that have YOUR best interest in mind. There will be good days and bad days during your recovery, but together you can get through them and she can do alot to help you recover. As a believer, she should know that God does not always bring a healing, but can use your experience to help others, make you stronger, or for other purposes you may not now discern. I am not discrediting healing, but your wife cannot presume that is what will happen in all cases. Maybe you could have another PSA test in the very near future for your wife's peace of mind before making a decision about how to proceed. Yes, there are risks with any treatment, but doing nothing also carries risk. I think your outlook can help with dealing with whatever you may face, and no two people are the same. My husband had surgery almost 5 weeks ago. He is not really having any ED issues, but is still dealing with some incontinence and challenges with changing and variable urinary frequency/urgency and stream, but it has not been anything horrible. Mainly, we just want to be sure we know if he has issues that require medical attention. He can still go to work in his office and no one knows he wears a pad. One will usually last all day. He is looking forward to the day he doesn't need them. The most important thing you need right now is your wife's support. I hope she will accept your decision and not brow beat or guilt you over whatever you choose. You ultimately have to make the decision that you feel is best for you. Once you make your decision and move ahead, don't look back and second guess. If you carefully plan and analyze all options, you should be comfortable with your choice. Good luck!",

      "Content": "We met with the doctor regarding radiation. My husband has a bone scan Friday and a meeting with a surgeon next week. My husband was told about the seeds and external beam, and with his work schedule and work-related travel, he does not want to commit to 8 weeks of daily radiation. The seeds sounded appealing to him, but the doctor said he would first have a hormone shot and then seeds done 3 months later (if he chose this option over surgery). We asked why the shot first and he said it gives it an extra one/two punch. This is sort of confusing since the shot is not required for external beam, and they supposedly have the same cure rate. Has anyone heard of doing this? Thanks! My husband is 56 years old with a normal DRE and prostate of normal size, and no symptoms. His PSA was 4.3. The results show 5 out of 12 positive with the following: Right Apex 3 + 3 = 6 involving 10% of specimen, cancer length 0.15cm Right Base 3 + 4 = 7 involving 70% of specimen, gleason pattern 4 comprises 10% of the cancer - cancer length 1.12 cm Right Lat Mid 3 + 3 = 6 involving 5% of specimen - cancer length 0.08 cm Right Lat Base 3 + 4 = 7 involving 80% of specimen, gleason pattern 4 comprises 10% of the cancer - cancer length 1.12 cm, perineural invasion Left Lat Apex 3 + 3 = 6 involving 20% of specimen, cancer length 0.28 cm",

      "Content": "Wayne, You said your wife is a devout Christian and believes trusting in man instead of God is anti-biblical and would doom you. She insists on natural medicine and prayer. Forgive me, but seeking treatment and making intelligent, informed decisions is NOT anti-biblical and is not dishonoring God. How is seeking treatment trusting in man and not God? You can still seek treatment, find the best medical provider you can trust and trust the results to God and pray for a positive outcome and strength for your ordeal. I am a Christian wife and I don't believe there is anything wrong with seeking treatment. God gave us highly-skilled medical professionals and it is our responsibility to use their gifts to help us. The best thing your wife can do for you is help you make good, informed decisions that have YOUR best interest in mind. There will be good days and bad days during your recovery, but together you can get through them and she can do alot to help you recover. As a believer, she should know that God does not always bring a healing, but can use your experience to help others, make you stronger, or for other purposes you may not now discern. I am not discrediting healing, but your wife cannot presume that is what will happen in all cases. Maybe you could have another PSA test in the very near future for your wife's peace of mind before making a decision about how to proceed. Yes, there are risks with any treatment, but doing nothing also carries risk. I think your outlook can help with dealing with whatever you may face, and no two people are the same. My husband had surgery almost 5 weeks ago. He is not really having any ED issues, but is still dealing with some incontinence and challenges with changing and variable urinary frequency/urgency and stream, but it has not been anything horrible. Mainly, we just want to be sure we know if he has issues that require medical attention. He can still go to work in his office and no one knows he wears a pad. One will usually last all day. He is looking forward to the day he doesn't need them. The most important thing you need right now is your wife's support. I hope she will accept your decision and not brow beat or guilt you over whatever you choose. You ultimately have to make the decision that you feel is best for you. Once you make your decision and move ahead, don't look back and second guess. If you carefully plan and analyze all options, you should be comfortable with your choice. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Still trying to figure out the difference between these two. Viagra comes in 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg strengths and Revatio only comes in 20 mg strength. Both say they are phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors. Both are sildenafil citrate from Pfizer. The only difference I could find was Viagra is indicated for ED, and Revatio is indicated for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Maybe the difference is only how they are marketing the two products. The other difference is that there appears to be a generic for Revatio, but not Viagra. Anyone have experience with Revatio? Thanks!",

      "Content": "My husband is scheduled for a biopsy next week. This is all very confusing. He is 56 years old and had a PSA reading of 4.3. His previous PSA was 4 years earlier at age 52, and it was 2.5. The only other PSA was 6 years before that in 2004 when he was 46 years old, and it was .71. His primary care referred him to a urologist and the urologist wants to do the biopsy. He has no symptoms of any kind and had a normal DRE. They did no other testing before ordering a biopsy such as urine tests, repeat PSA, etc. Doctors also say you could have PC with a low PSA. It seems as if everyone is a candidate for a biopsy in that case. I am not downplaying the importance of getting a biopsy, but worry about over diagnosis and over treatment. I am very concerned for men that are struggling with making these decisions. There needs to be better testing, or eventually all men will be getting biopsies as a screening tool. I know it is important to be caught early, as my father is currently 76 years, and was diagnosed at age 74 with prostate cancer. My father has always been a very active, athletic man that has eaten healthy, never used tobacco or alcohol, and has maintained a healthy weight, has low cholesterol and normal blood pressure. The only issue he has ever had was arthritis (lots of sports) and was never on any type of prescription meds, but has taken joint supplements and OTC pain killers for the arthritis. He had a knee replaced 4 years ago, and just had a hip replaced. He has always worked outdoors doing physical labor, which he continued until age 70. He did not have regular PSA tests, but saw a doctor a few years ago because of urinary problems, where it was revealed he had a PSA of 26. He had taken many supplements over the years (at least 15 years) for \"prostate health\", such as saw palmetto and super beta prostate before his diagnosis. He now has to catheterize himself daily and is currently on hormone therapy, which has kept his PSA levels down. My mom wanted him on AS, but the doctor said hormone therapy is the only option to keep it from spreading to his bones. They said he is not a candidate for surgery or radiation either. He is still taking various supplements such as tumeric and cranberry. My mom is always reading and trying new things on him. He had a few suspicious areas on a bone scan, but they came back negative, and were possibly due to sports injuries. He refuses to have any more scans. I have several questions related to the above. 1. If hormone therapy blocks testosterone, is a man that is very muscular, or naturally produces more testosterone at a higher risk of prostate cancer? 2. Does a man with more testosterone have a larger prostate volume? 3. If ejaculating near the time of a PSA test raises PSA, does not ejaculating raise it as well? For example, if you become aroused and do not ejaculate, does that affect the prostate too? What happens to the retained fluid? In both cases, how much of an increase would that be? 4. Does a family history of other cancers raise the risk for prostate cancer? My dad's mother died of uterine cancer at 57 and my dad's grandfather died of leukemia at age 59. 5. Do those prostate supplements harm or help prostates? If they help with BPH, does it just mask or delay underlying issues? 6. Do other high dose supplements affect prostate? I worry that even something considered healthy, can be harmful if too much is taken. 7. Do biopsies increase cancer risk? Can they cause or spread cancer? 8. Do surgical procedures or dental work affect PSA level? 9. Do any meds, such as statins affect PSA, and does cholesterol level affect PSA? 10. Does a slow growing cancer look any different to a pathologist than an aggressive one? 11. Does prolonged driving of a vehicle and sitting for long periods of time affect PSA? 12. Does delaying urination or infrequent urination affect prostate? Thank you for your help.",

      "Content": "Is your PSA checked again right before the biopsy? I have heard the biopsy raises the PSA, but did not know how long after the biopsy it remains elevated until you can get a more accurate reading. Another reason I ask how long it takes is because when I had a breast biopsy with only 4 cores a few years ago, I developed a hematoma and it took almost 2 months to disappear even though they told me it would only take up to a couple weeks to resolve. Of course prostate tissue is different, and maybe not subject to the same swelling???",
