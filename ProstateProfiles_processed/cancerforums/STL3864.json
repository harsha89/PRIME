      "Content": "Has anyone else been frustrated with the term PSA doubling? I would think going from 0.04 to 0.08 is not the same as going from 4.0 to 8.0, yet all the references caution patients to monitor the PSA velocity. My PSA has been steady at 0.1 for six months after being non-detectable (<0.03) for the first 3 years following surgery. Had positive margins but the prostate gland is completely gone. And is there any benefit in seeing a medical oncologist instead of a radiology oncologist (already consulted and raring to go with radiation therapy) about this? Thank you.",

      "Content": "Thanks to you both, Fairwind and Highlander. Did consult with a hemo/onco specialist (referred by my PCP) who said every patient/cancer/treatment case is unique. He offered no more helpful advice beyond very close monitoring, then directly billed me an outrageous sum for an initial consultation. It was my costly mistake as I found this doctor did not accept any insurance plan even though the receptionist copies your insurance card. Got so mad that I returned directly to \"GO\" and started all over. Found another book that identified a website for a San Diego-based Informed Prostate Cancer Support Group (ipcsg.org) that taught me many things that I have not read before anywhere. For example: when did radiation get started; why did surgery become more prominent, when did nerve-sparing surgery start; why surgery patients have urinary and sexual side effects; why do radiation patients have rectal side-effects; and most importantly, what improvements have been made in recent years to diminish these side effects. Includes videos from Dr. Snuffy Myers that offers helpful critiques of therapy, studies, etc. It's a shame that the news media doesn't have the time or the expertise to do a better job of objectively reporting on cancer treatments. The lack of really good information fuels the quack medicine fads.",
