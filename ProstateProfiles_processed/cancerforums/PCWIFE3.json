      "Content": "Hello: back again with another question. My husband had Davinci surgery 3 weeks ago today. He had his catheter removed last Friday. While he had the catheter, there was ALWAYS blood in his urine. The doctor took a look and said that this was likely due to the catheter rubbing against the bladder and should go away within a few days of removing it. Since he had the catheter removed, he's had no problems with incontinence (thus far), but every time he urinates, he has a spasm and then a drop of fresh blood comes out. He said he has a really strong stream and just before he is done, it automatically stops with a sharp spasm and new blood. I called the nurses and they said that this could be normal and to follow up with his doctor. We don't see him until the 16th of November so just wondering if anyone else has had a similar issue? Again thanks to all of you who post here....you've really put my mind at ease about so much.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your response Ron_G and for posting the link from JH. I did try to post the pathology report (tried to add it to my signature) but i guess it didn't work. I'll give you a condensed version here: - Robotic assisted prostatectomy performed September 23rd. Gleason scored upgraded to G7 (3+4). - Right nerve sparing procedure 90-95% spared - Left nerve sparing - 70% spared - Proportion (percent) of prostate involved by tumor = 20% - no lymph nodes present (no nodes sumbitted or found) - positive margins found (bladder neck and posterior margins) - adenocarcinoma - perineural invasion present - pT3a (extraprostatic extension or microscopic invasion of bladder neck) not sure what else is relevant or what this all means. Trying to do as much research as i can. My husband is only 47 so this is all a bit of a shock for us. He had a high psa for his age (6) at the beginning of the year. Doctor was confident it was just an enlarged prostate. Had a biopsy in May and found what was thought to be a G6 tumor (later upgraded to G7). Decided to have surgery. Again doctor was confident that this would \"solve\" the issue. Now we're hearing that radiation is likely going to happen down the line. Trying to remain positive but feeling so overwhelmed by it all",

      "Content": "Thanks Fairwind. I'm not sure how many positive margins there are or how large an area it was (don't see that on the pathology report). I will be sure to ask the doctor next time we see him. The doctor also stressed that now is the time to focus on healing and not think about radiation. He said he should concentrate on improving incontinence and ED but as my husband said, he would rather LIVE with those issues than face the alternative (i.e. die from this disease). Doctor seems to think that waiting three months will not change anything. He wants to get a second opinion which can't hurt. Thanks again to all of you who share your stories on here and take the time to answer all these questions. It really helps to hear encouraging stories from all of you....especially when dealing with findings that are less than ideal. Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Hello all: Just had our follow up appointment after Robot Assisted Prostatectomy. I'm at a loss and looking for some insight (positivity?). I'll start with a bit of background info. Husband had high PSA at 47 years old (it was around 6). Had a biopsy back in May and was diagnosed with Gleason 6 PC. Doctor gave us our options...said the risk was low, but my husband wanted to have the surgery and just remove it anyway. He had surgery on September 23rd. Today was our first follow up appointment to get the pathology report as well as the first PSA level. Turns out that his gleason score was upgraded to G7 (3+4). His new PSA was <0.01 but there were positive margins. The doctor mentioned that this will likely mean radiation is in his future but that he wanted to wait three months or so before addressing this (he said he needed time to heal first). I'm trying to decipher the pathology report and am still a bit confused. Does \"positive margins\" mean he still has cancer or that the tumor was just touching other margins?! Why would he want to do radiation if his PSA is undetectable? Is this a preventative measure? If he has to start radiation treatments, should he not start them sooner rather than later? Doctor mentioned that it hadn't gone into his lymph nodes but my husband is concerned that maybe he just didn't see it and should he have had his lymph nodes removed as well? As you can see, we are full of doubts and questions. The appointment was all so overwhelming and i'm sure i missed some info along the way so i thought i'd reach out to you guys that have been through this before. Does this seem normal? Is there anything we should be asking the doctor? Any input is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

Why would he want to do radiation if his PSA is undetectable? Is this a preventative measure? If he has to start radiation treatments, should he not start them sooner rather than later? Doctor mentioned that it hadn't gone into his lymph nodes but my husband is concerned that maybe he just didn't see it and should he have had his lymph nodes removed as well? As you can see, we are full of doubts and questions. The appointment was all so overwhelming and i'm sure i missed some info along the way so i thought i'd reach out to you guys that have been through this before. Does this seem normal? Is there anything we should be asking the doctor? Any input is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

      "Content": "Thanks for your response Ron_G and for posting the link from JH. I did try to post the pathology report (tried to add it to my signature) but i guess it didn't work. I'll give you a condensed version here: - Robotic assisted prostatectomy performed September 23rd. Gleason scored upgraded to G7 (3+4). - Right nerve sparing procedure 90-95% spared - Left nerve sparing - 70% spared - Proportion (percent) of prostate involved by tumor = 20% - no lymph nodes present (no nodes sumbitted or found) - positive margins found (bladder neck and posterior margins) - adenocarcinoma - perineural invasion present - pT3a (extraprostatic extension or microscopic invasion of bladder neck) not sure what else is relevant or what this all means. Trying to do as much research as i can. My husband is only 47 so this is all a bit of a shock for us. He had a high psa for his age (6) at the beginning of the year. Doctor was confident it was just an enlarged prostate. Had a biopsy in May and found what was thought to be a G6 tumor (later upgraded to G7). Decided to have surgery. Again doctor was confident that this would \"solve\" the issue. Now we're hearing that radiation is likely going to happen down the line. Trying to remain positive but feeling so overwhelmed by it all",

      "Content": "Thanks Fairwind. I'm not sure how many positive margins there are or how large an area it was (don't see that on the pathology report). I will be sure to ask the doctor next time we see him. The doctor also stressed that now is the time to focus on healing and not think about radiation. He said he should concentrate on improving incontinence and ED but as my husband said, he would rather LIVE with those issues than face the alternative (i.e. die from this disease). Doctor seems to think that waiting three months will not change anything. He wants to get a second opinion which can't hurt. Thanks again to all of you who share your stories on here and take the time to answer all these questions. It really helps to hear encouraging stories from all of you....especially when dealing with findings that are less than ideal. Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Hello: First i wanted to thank all of you who take the time to post here. I've been lurking for the past few months and have found the information invaluable. My husband was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer at 47 years old (Gleason 6). He had Devinci surgery last wedneday and is now at home recovering. I've told him about this Forum, but sadly he doesn't want to read up on anything! When it was time for him to be discharged from the hospital, he was in such a rush to get out that he was waiting for me outside of the hospital. This means i didn't have a chance to talk with the nurses about what to expect next. I've put a call in but while i'm waiting for an answer, thought i'd post a few questions here. - is it normal to wait 6 weeks before retesting the psa? My husband is a pretty anxious person and i know that waiting this long is not going to be easy for him. I spoke with the surgeon about this and he said PSA stays in the blood for some time after (even after the prostate has been removed) and this is the reason for the long wait. Is this common? - Do the staples get removed when the catheter is removed? We have an appointment to remove the Catheter on the 9th....is it normal to have a catheter in for so long (it will be in for over 2 weeks)? - He still has a bit of blood in his urine....how long does this last? He also notices a bit of blood at the tip of the catheter when sitting to go to the bathroom....again, how long should this last? - He is feeling pretty well physically...walking and eating normally. He never filled the prescription for oxy-codone and has been managing the pain with tylenol extra strength (2 pills every 6 hours). The nurse said to take it regularly so that it keeps the pain under control. When should he start to see if he can go longer? - Is there anything else i should be aware of? Any other tips? Thanks again for all your contributions to this site....it really has been great to read about others that have gone through (or are currently going through) the same experiences.",

      "Content": "Hello.... as I mentioned in a previous thread, my husband had DaVinci last Wednesday. He was doing great after the surgery... Eating, walking, manageable pain, etc until last night. He developed a fever, chills, sweat, and severe abdominal pain. I called the triage nurses and they said it was likely a bladder spasm. They suggested taking the spasms medication which he hasn't had to take up until now. This morning he still has a low grade fever and said he just feels off. My question is, is it normal to develop the symptoms after 6 days? Is this something we should be concerned about or just part of the healing process? Has anyone else had similar experiences?",

They just gave him an IV drip for dehydration and took a urine sample as well as blood tests. They said they had to wait to get the results to see what type of infection it was and if they found anything concerning, they would let us know. I looked at the values on the report from the blood cells....his lymphocyte values were quite high and rising but still within the normal range. Doctor seemed to think it was a urinary tract infection and this is possibly what caused the bladder spasms and dark coloured urine (think dark ale). Seemed to be a bit better last night before he went to bed, but woke up this morning with a lot of blood in the catheter bag!!!! Again, not sure if this is normal?!?! It's all so frustrating as we won't see a doctor for a while (don't get the catheter removed until the 9th)!!!",
