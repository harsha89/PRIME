      "Content": "Hey guys I am sad to be posting here but thankful there seems to be a nice community here. I went to the doctor to get my testosterone levels checked. They came back very low for my age at 320. In the process of doing all the tests associated with testosterone replacement therapy my doctor ran a PSA test and it came back at 5.0. I was back in today to speak with a urologist and he seemed suprised and confused. He said that it was extremely rare for someone my age to have a PSA that high or Testosterone that low- let alone both. He said there was probably a 30% chance that I have prostate cancer. I am taking anti-biotics for a few weeks then going to get retested. If the numbers don't change I will be having a biopsy. My doctor was at least a very positive person. He told me that even if it was cancer I should consider myself lucky as they never could have caught it that early without the test done for the testosterone. This would mean I likely caught it very early as I don't have any symptoms. I see his point but I can't help but worry. I am a worrier by nature and this has sent me into overdrive- not to insensitive because I know there are many on here who are in a way worse spot. Anyway I haven't been able to find much if anything on PC or elevated PSA in younger men. The stats I see say 99% of all PC is in men over 50. Is anyone going through anything similar? Anyone have any advice?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago I'd say that borders on malpractice. To immediately run you through a series of anti-biotics and then retest in what sounds like it may only be a few weeks is just plain nuts. A reasonable urologist would allow some significant time to elapse between testing. Not just a few weeks. The antibiotics are probably a waste of time as most prostatitis is not bacterial in origin. At any rate, if he retests you in a couple week (which is poor practice)... and your psa is still 4.0 or higher... then do NOT allow a biopsy to be taken. Instead wait at least another month or two and retest your psa. It is very very common for inflammations of the prostate to take simple plain old time to calm down. Not from antibiotics... not from early testing... just simple time. To rush ahead with a biopsy in only a few weeks is insane. As pratoman suggested below my doctor thinks it might have been lab error. I got my original work done at a \"mens clinic\" and my urologist seemed extremely unimpressed by them. I think he would have ordered a retest regardless because the men's clinic runs the labs in house.",

      "Content": "Hey everyone. In early 2016 I went to get my testosterone checked and during the process it was discovered that my psa was around 5.0. During the last 18 months I've been having it checked every three months and it's hovered between 3.8-5.3. We ran a few courses of antibiotics- including one that lasted a month. My doctor has now recommended a biopsy. His initial recommendation was a MRI- but my insurance won't cover it and it would be 3500$. I have it scheduled for august 2nd. It's under local anesthesia. My concern is that even if it shows nothing that doesn't mean there is nothing there right? Is there anyway to know for sure that there's nothing there? What else could be causing my psa to be so consistently high for such a long time. My doctor said he didn't know.",

Painful and long lasting damage. From my experience, I would recommend that you insist on having some of the tests mentioned above, before taking the risk of a biopsy. My free PSA was 10%. It's the only other test I've had. The doctor did a DRE and said it felt normal- but no ultrasound. What complications did you have if you don't mind me asking. I am a little hesitant to wait as I have insurance through the ACA and I'm uncertain if it will be available nest year.",

      "Content": "Hey everyone. In early 2016 I went to get my testosterone checked and during the process it was discovered that my psa was around 5.0. During the last 18 months I've been having it checked every three months and it's hovered between 3.8-5.3. We ran a few courses of antibiotics- including one that lasted a month. My doctor has now recommended a biopsy. His initial recommendation was a MRI- but my insurance won't cover it and it would be 3500$. I have it scheduled for august 2nd. It's under local anesthesia. My concern is that even if it shows nothing that doesn't mean there is nothing there right? Is there anyway to know for sure that there's nothing there? What else could be causing my psa to be so consistently high for such a long time. My doctor said he didn't know.",

      "Content": "Hey guys I posted a few times about having a high PSA at a young age. Well I did end up getting a biopsy and it showed no signs of cancer(great news). But it did show atrophy in 8 cores and chronic inflammation in 4. My doctor said it was pretty certain that is what was causing the high PSA and that I was fine. In the excitement I didn't really ask any questions but I was wondering if there is anything to be worried about with that much inflammation and damage to the prostrate? Or what could be causing this?",
