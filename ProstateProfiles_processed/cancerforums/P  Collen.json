      "Content": "I'm 69 y.o. this June. In 2010 my PCP noticed my PSA was at 3.5 and recommended I see a Urologist. I did, and agreed to a biopsy, which detected an extremely small 0.8mm cancerous tissue in one one of the 12 biopsy samples. I decided on \"watchful waiting\" . I had another biopsy in 2012 which detected NOTHING, and a third in 2015 which again detected NOTHING. My PSA had increased to 5.5 as of Jan 2017, but I had a mild heart attack 4/02/17 and had a stent put in and started taking statin, blood thinner, and beta-blocker drugs. My next PSA test in July 2017 indicated PSA level at 3.5 and as of yesterday it is 3.8. So my Urologist wants to do another biopsy; he thinks one every 2-3 years is necessary. My heart doctor, and my regular PCP recommend not doing another biopsy unless my PSA increases dramatically to 8-10, given the negative findings the last two times. I tend to agree. Would you have a 4th biopsy given a >4 and holding PSA level, most recent 2 out of 3 biopsy's NEGATIVE, and 69 y.o. ? Is it simply a matter of how much uncertainty can you live with comfortably.",
