      "Content": "I have recurrent prostate cancer. In 1999 I had a radical prostatectomy but shortly after that, my PSA began to rise. By late 2005 it had reached 15 and was doubling in less than a year. After two months of four capsules of Prostasol per day, my PSA had dropped to 0.3. Two months later at two capsules per day it was still 0.3. Two months later at one capsule per day it was 0.1. I am now taking one capsule every other day and will have another PSA test in about a month. It does work and it is easier for me to live with than Lupron which I was on for three months in 2001. I don't know how long this will continue to hold my PSA down but it works for me now and the side effects are relatively mild at my current dosage. It is certainly cheap enough to try for two months.",
