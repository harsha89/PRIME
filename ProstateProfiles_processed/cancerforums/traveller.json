      "Content": "Hi, I was dx 5 years ago, had surgery, pt3b, gl 8 tertiary 5. Had adjuvant IMRT. PSA recurrence 1 year ago, Psa increased from 0 to 0.8. MO started casodex 150 mg, psa dropped to <0.1 in one montrh. Dose reduced to 50 mg at the end of first month. PSA is undetectable since then. my question: Routine therapy for a high risk patient with PSA relapse is to start Lupron (or similar) with or w/o casodex. MY MO prescribed casodex only and I'm happy with the better quality of life and lesser side effects. However, I don't know if there are risks associated with casodex monotherapy. Is it possible that cancer cells become hormone resistant faster? Will Lupron still work when casodex stops working? Why is the casodex monotherapy not the primary treatment option? Thanks for your input",

      "Content": "Thanks Bigbrad, I know that ultrasensitive test results may create unneeded anxiety. PSA increase from 0.003 to 0.007 and then to 0.01 does not indicate recurrence but it does not eliminate the risk of recurrence as well. Looking at these numbers, I think there is some activity going on; it may or may not stabilize at a value below the detectable level (0.1) in the coming months. We just don't know yet. Even if we know that there is recurrence, there are no treatments available at this point, nor any screening or other tests to detect where the cancer is. So the only option is to wait... Any comments?",

      "Content": "Hi Bigbrad, My PSA post op was 0.02 then 0.03. I started adjuvant HT and then adjuvant RT. After starting Lupron, my PSA dropped to 0.003 and stayed there throughout the hormone and radiation therapies. I had my last Lupron shot (3 months) in June 2012, my PSA continued to be at 0.003 until July 2013 when it slightly increased to 0.007. T level was 6 during hormone therapy and then rose to 486 in April 2013. Recently in September this year, PSA was 0.01, still undetectable, but there may be an upward trend. T level dropped to 350. I think T level will stabilize at a lower level, I feel there is decrease in my libido, and am curious if the relatively lower T level has any effect on PSA level and velocity",

My question is does it matter to have high or low T levels on PSA? In other words, if there is residual cancer cells and PSA increases due to increase in testosterone, will PSA increase higher and faster if T level is higher (i.e. T level being 500ng/ml vs 200ng/ml).",

      "Content": "Hi, this is my first post in this forum. Summary of my prostate ca is below. It has been almost 2.5 years since diagnosis of my disease. I am doing well, retired from my job following my surgery and enjoying life ) My PSA results are good, been at 0.003 ng/ml throughout the ADT and RT. My last Lupron shot was in June 2012 and all 3 PSA test results after that was also same, 0.003 ng/ml. My question is how low can the PSA test be, can it be 0.000? Obviously I was under ADT and the low PSA readings are attributable to the ADT. Since I had my last 3 months Lupron injection in June 2012, its protection effect will disappear after stopping the therapy. Does anyone know how long is the carryover effect of the hormone therapy? In other words, how long will it take for the PSA to start increasing, if it will increase at all? My last question would be dose anyone recommend taking aspirin daily as an aid for recovery from agressive prostate ca as in my case Appreciate your input, thanks a lot.
