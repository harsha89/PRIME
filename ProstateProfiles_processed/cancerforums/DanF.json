      "Content": "I am 60 years old. At age 51 I had a PSA of 4.1, DRE was normal. Three years later it rose to 6.7 and the DRE was normal. At that time my Doctor put me on 2 weeks of Cypro and after the Cypro my PSA dropped to 5.6. I also had a Present of free PSA test done and the results showed .65 ng/ml of free PSA, a percentage of 11%. Four months later my PSA was back up to 6.2. Four more months and my PSA was still only at 6.0 however in six more months it rose to 7.4. Now nine months later it is up to 8.5. I am seeing a different doctor and he says he can feel an abnormal prostate. He says it is very slightly asymmetrical (slightly larger on one side) otherwise normal. He says my PSA is way to high for my age and wants to do a biopsy. Of course I am not too keen on the idea of going through the pain, possibility of complications, and cost since I am not insured, however I am concerned as to why my PSA is so high. Should I go ahead with the biopsy?",

Not good odds. He says he now gives a antibiotic 1 hour before plus an injection and follow up antibiotics after. I will ask about the numbing. I asked the front desk about cost and was told he charges about $500 and then there is the pathologist, which is about $90 per sample. Then the doctor said since I am not insured he will charge the same as the lowest insurance will pay which is Medicare (don\u2019t know that cost). I\u2019m thinking about $1500 to $2000. It\u2019s the cost of what they find that scares me. I just hate to go through all this and find out it is probably not cancer and just an infection (maybe that\u2019s a good thing) but I guess the biopsy will tell that.",
