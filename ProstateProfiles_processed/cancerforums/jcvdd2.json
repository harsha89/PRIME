Since I have had two negative biopsies over the past three years, my Urologist suggested that I have a MRI scan of my prostate which I just had yesterday. The written results of the MRI scan were given to me by the radiologist and I am seeking any advice / suggestions based upon the reading of the scan until I see my Urologist next week. [url]http:// -- LINK TO IMAGE REMOVED BY MODERATOR] Final Report- Discussion- The prostate gland measures 5.5 x 6.1 x 5.c cm in size, correlating with a volume of 91cc. No significant pregadolinium T1 signal abnormality is seen in the peripheral zones. There is a T2 hypointense nodule in the right posterior lateral peripheral zone of the apex of the gland measuring .6 x .7 cm in size with early asymmetric enhancement, relatively rapid washout, and restricted diffusion. No discrete extracapsular extension is present. Nodular enlargement of the central gland with mild compression of the peripheral zone is identified. 6 x 7 mm T2 hypointense nodule in the right posterior lateral peripheral zone of the inferior gland with early enhancement and restricted diffusion; PI-RADS 4.

As you had suggested, my Urologist has scheduled me for a Fusion Biopsy within the next several weeks. My Urologist advised me that he is one of a handful of Urologist that Are qualified to perform, interpret and implement at his own practice a Prostate Fusion Biopsy. (Apparently my Urologist shares a Prostate Fusion Biopsy Machine with several other physicians in the area). If you would be so kind and within the limits of this message board, would you please answer a question that I asked my Urologist but he was reticent in responding to me. Based solely on a steady PSA reading of approximately 10.5 & a PI-RAD\u2019s reading of 4, what Is the APPROXIMATE percentage of finding a significant cancer within the prostate? As a reference, according to \u201cDr. Google\u201d, the percentage was 61%. Thanks once again\u2026. Joe, Miami",
