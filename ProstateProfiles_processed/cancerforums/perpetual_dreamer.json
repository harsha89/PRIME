    "Content": "Hello Everyone, Nice to have come across this active forum while scouring online for information on prostate cancer/treatments. Its always more personal communicating with real people online. Each of you who've been through this journey or currently going through it display much courage and strength. Hats off to you all and my sincerest of best wishes for those currently going through treatment. Even though its my 66 year old dad who is dealing with prostate cancer and will be going through treatment, I am terrified with stress levels through the roof. I will be grateful for any advice and suggestions you can give my dad before he starts with his treatment. We are located in Toronto, Canada. My dad has pretty much decided to go for surgery as he feels there is the option of radiation in the future if needed. He is willing to put up with temporary side effects although I'm not too sure he fully understand all the risks. Health wise he is fairly active, walks and jogs almost daily. I would appreciate any of your advice or suggestions regarding what treatment would be best for him and anything that will help us better understand the options, risks, treatment types, etc. At the moment, my only concern is the surgery doctor he has been referred to seems fairly young. He was a replacement for an older doctor who either retired or got transferred. From looking up online, the doctor was a 5th year Urology resident in surgery during 2008. Does that time give a doctor enough experience in surgery? I've looked up his name online but there are only 5 reviews of him, although all are positive. https://www.ratemds.com/doctor-ratin...orough-ON.html Thank you. Also, I was wondering how soon should he get his treatment? Below are some stats for my dad: Age: 66 Gleason Score: 7 (3+4) PSA numbers are: PSA 4.0 ug/L (on March 08, 2017) PSA 3.55 ug/L (on Nov 29, 2016) PSA 3.67 ug/L (on June 15,2016) Total number of Cores: 15 Number of Cores Positive: 2 Part A - Prostate biopsy target apex 1: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 6/10 (3+3) Part B - Prostate biopsy target apex 2,3: Negative for Malignancy Part C - Prostate biopsy RAL: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 7/10 (3+4) Part D - Prostate biopsy RMM - Negative for Malignancy Part E - Prostate biopsy RAM - Negative for Malignancy Part F - Prostate biopsy RML - Negative for Malignancy Part G - Prostate biopsy RBL - Negative for Malignancy Part H - Prostate biopsy RBM - Negative for Malignancy Part I - Prostate biopsy LAL - Negative for Malignancy Part J - Prostate biopsy LMM - Focal prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, high grade Part K - Prostate biopsy LAM - Negative for Malignancy Part L - Prostate biopsy LML - Negative for Malignancy Part M - Prostate biopsy LBL - Negative for Malignancy Part N - Prostate biopsy LML - Negative for Malignancy",
