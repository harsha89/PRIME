      "Content": "I'm young (Under 21), and my father, who is in his 50's, was recently having trouble using the bathroom. He went to see a doctor and has PSA levels in the 40s. He goes in this week to find out if it's cancer. I'm at a loss for words, I realize it could be bad but I'm not sure of the scope of it. Any advice? Update (3/29): Results came back, and they were able to rule out prostate cancer. They're going to do further tests to check on everything else, but other than that it appears he is in the clear. Thanks to everyone who replied.",

      "Content": "I don't have a ton of details, he hasn't said too much because, as you said, it might not be a huge concern and doesn't want anyone to get too worried. His trouble urinating only started not that long ago and he went to a doctor almost immediately. I believe he has had a few tests to confirm the PSA levels, and I believe the biopsy is what he is having this week. As far as I'm aware, my family doesn't have a history of PC. Thank's for the reassurance.",
