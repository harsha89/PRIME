    "Content": "So my stepdad just found out that he has an aggressive form of cancer (10 on Gleason score) and his PSA level was 400. Yes I typed that correctly...4-0-0. His doctor also stated that it has spread to his bones but gave him a life expectancy estimate of 3 years. If you have any knowledge of this cancer or what these scores mean for his diagnosis, please let us know. He also does not have life insurance and unsure if he will even be approved now. So also, any advice on insurance companies? I personally feel that his time is much shorter and we have a lot of questions...thank you....",
