He is in catheter right now and I don't know if he can urinate whe it will be removed. I'm so worried for him and i hope and pray that inspite to all of these he can recover. I have not told my dad yet as I was the only one who went to the doctor to have the biopsy read. I don't know, maybe I need somebody who can comfort and advise me on what will be my next steps. I'm so confused right now. We were advised by the euro to have a bone scan.",

I try to be but sometimes when i am not with my dad i cry. But i dont him to see that. Tomorrow we will have the bone scan. I will update here once i have the result. I appreciate all your words it uplift me somehow. Also i would like to ask. Is there a chance for my dad to be able to pee again? What did you do or what medicines did you take. I know that i will have to ask the doctor regarding this but i want to know other people's experience. Again thank you guys and God bless us all.
