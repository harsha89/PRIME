      "Content": "This is a repost from the General Cancer area. Sorry I initially posted to the wrong forum !!! Here's the quick story. I'm a retired Airline Pilot, Age 65 years. Regular old Caucasian Guy, no history of Prostate Cancer in the Family. Visit the Family Doctor every 3 months for Diabetes follow up. Not well controlled but that's my doing (Snack and cheat too much). Any way, that's not my question of the day. For years, my PSA has been a 2 - 2.2 up until Nov. 2017. Family Doctor recorded a 4.6 from LABCORP (9 month interval from the last test, again Nov. 2017 at this time). I requested we retest the PSA, but he said time to see a Urologist. Went to the Urologist, did the interview, DRE test, and mentioned I'd like another PSA test. He said the next step is to do a Prostate Biopsy, which I wasn't convinced I needed ??? Also, as I walked out the door he said \"You have nothing to worry about, you're going to be just fine\". I have no idea what the comment was in regard too, but as I settled down about a day later, I got to thinking that he pretty well knows from the DRE Exam, that I'm probably OK, but there are no facts to support this right now, and to stay out of court possibly, he wants the test. A week later, I figured out how to pay cash on line, and get my own PSA Test at QUEST. This test was performed about 2 weeks from the last one and was a 2.9 reading again from Quest this time. I then decided I would wait a bit and retest which I have done now 5 weeks later at QUEST again. This time the result was 2.9 again from Quest, and I got the PSA Free added this time which was 0.4, and the PSA % Free of 14. That last value flags me as a 24% chance of Prostate Cancer for my situation. This is based on a footnote at the bottom of the QUEST Blood lab results. Not sure what the next plan should be. I like my Family Doctor and will be seeing him in 4 weeks. I even liked the Urologist, but the Office Staff didn't want to let me cancel the Prostate Biopsy when I did, based on my 2.9 numbers. The Head Nurse (that's as far as I could get up the food chain), was telling me all kinds of stories of people with 2.0 and 1.5 readings, that get the biopsy. I just didn't want to buy off on that story because I'm assuming she was not discussing other relevant details of those patients. I'm not sure where my 4.6 came from, but now I have two 2.9 readings, which is below the red flag score of 4.0 or greater. I will be taking one more test at LABCORP this time late next week, to have 2 readings from each lab at different times. I'm assuming the number will be in the 2.9 range again, but still learning about this free PSA stuff. Any thoughts on what I might do different, before another discussion with the Family Doctor in 4 weeks. Concerned he might send me back to the Urologist again for the Biopsy, and I don't want any unnecessary testing like that, if I don't need it. I guess my big question is, should I submit to the Prostate Biopsy, based on Doctors that seemed more concerned about possible legal action, versus my additional testing that seems to put me sort of in the clear ???? Thanks for any input you can offer in advance. jabr800",

      "Content": "Hello Chuck and thanks for the quick reply, The lab tests at both LabCorp (One test of 4.6 and one to happen in about a week) and Quest (Two separate tests 5 weeks apart both reading identical 2.9) were a blood draw at their offices, sample sent to a nearby lab, then results sent to me (via email) about 24 hours later. My big concern was the old 2.2 readings (9 months ago and always in the past), then 4.6 (not sure I want to accept this one), then a DOUBLE 2.9. I felt like switching labs might help me identify which place might be giving out erroneous info. That's why my plan for my 4th PSA test will take place at LabCorp in a week or so, which will result in 2 tests from each place. Probably an overkill on my part, but I fell like this could tell me which place to believe in !!! That's where I am at so far, and I appreciate your thoughts and comments.
