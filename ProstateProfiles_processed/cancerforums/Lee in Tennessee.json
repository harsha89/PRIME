I began my process on Monday April 10th with infusions of my cells on Thursdays of each week. April 27th was my last day and I was able to complete the process in 3 straight weeks. Reason being, my veins were not good enough to handle the process so they put in a temporary port which allowed me to go each week instead of every other week. My only side affects was being very tired and fatigued after having the white cells removed and also on the days I received my infusions. Removing the port was somewhat strange. I chose not to receive anything to take off the edge. They put a lot of pressure in the area the port, pulled really hard, heard a pop and out it came. They also took blood for a PSA which they called this morning and said it was 4.54. I was expecting much higher if you read my stats and also many patients have much higher PSA with Provenge. Have an appointment the end of May which they may prescribe additional meds. I have a lot of hope the Provenge will work for me and others who decide upon this treatment.

      "Content": "Just a quick update. I was approved for the Provenge therapy which I will start in a couple of weeks. It appears my veins can't support the procedure so they must connect a apheresis catheter in my chest. When I read about Provenge, you really get a mixed bag of comments. In turn, you begin to question whether this treatment is right for your situation. It reminds me of movie Forrest Gump and his quote of \"Mama always said life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\" In my case and others like myself, we have to hope we made the right choice. After reading Todd Seals blog, \"Living with Prostate Cancer\", I decided I wanted to use every bullet in my arsenal to defeat this disease that we all hate. If you haven't read his blog, I urge everyone to do so. Lee",
