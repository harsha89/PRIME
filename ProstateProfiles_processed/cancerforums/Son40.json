      "Content": "Originally Posted by Son40 Hi all, This is my first post here and I have a question that I hope someone can help me with. History- my dad was diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer ( psa 890 and widespread bone involvement). He enjoyed a nine month remission with an initial androgen blockade, 3 months of remission on Zytiga and a slow increase in psa with mdv 3100. Fast forward to now and a recent ct has shown liver metastatses, which are an unusual involvement. My mother emailed me liver panel results that make absolutely no sense to me and I was hoping that someone might be able to shed some light on them. Alkaline phosphatase - 11.87. Ref range - 40-120 Sgot - 2.43 - ref range 10-42 Sgpt - 1.08. Ref range 10 -60 There results are super low and I'm wondering if my mother misplaced the decimals!! I'm going to call his doc on Monday but can anyone shed light on why these results would be so low? He is not on any therapy at the moment, although the doc really wants to start chemo ASAP. Last psa draw measured at 1259. I thought that these liver function results would measure in the elevated range given liver metastases, rather than low. So it seems that my mother decided to put decimals in. This makes the results actually make sense. Does anyone know about the prognosis when the liver is the secondary metastasis site?",
