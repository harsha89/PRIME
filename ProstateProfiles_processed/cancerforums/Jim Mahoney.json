      "Content": "Kozmic got a referral from my Urologist, his nurses made contact and the Physical Therapy receptionist contacted me. Thanks Steve, Glad I decided to seek help with a professional Therapist. Since my 1st session I've adjusted my urinating pattern, spacing out amount of time in between voids. Instead of going frequently, try to avoid emptying small amounts. So 3 to 4hr period between urinating, I read a post on here about this. Kegel exercises instructions were exactly what was instructed by Urologist. Contractions of 5sec. with 5sec. rest periods 10x 3x a day, Quick contractions 2sec. 10x 3x a day Office kegel exercises consist of inserting a probe which is hooked up to a computer where the contractions intensity is measured . My physical therapist does explain before the insertion of the device but she clearly caught me off guard wasn't expecting this, my Medical Insurance doesn't cover the cost of $47 for the stimulation probe sensor, told the wife now I own my very first butt probe lol, man what next. Well at least my Insurance pays for 6 sessions",

Of course I questioned it, being confused and thinking why would they need to give me a digital rectal exsam? So I approached the secretary and told her, look the only person doing any inserting is my Urologist. Okay Mr.Mahoney I'll have the Therapist explain this latter. lol word of advice do your homework before you going to PT. Therapist and I died laughing in the exam room. Research is helpful people.",

My Dad had prostate cancer back in the day, sorry don't know the date, my Dad and I have the same Urologist, my Dad has a hard time remembering of all his prostate procedures due to memory loss, he helps me with whatever he can remember if I have questions. I'll try to jump in on here has much as I need to, you know it does help me release some of stress and just having somewhere to say what's on my mind during this stressful time of my life. JM",
