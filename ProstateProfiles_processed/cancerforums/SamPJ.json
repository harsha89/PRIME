However based on the initial findings from biopsy, doctors (haematologist) are pretty sure that it is Defused Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). They would like to start treatment with low intensity steroids right away as they they think it\u0092s of aggressive kind. (I could not catch the name of the drug). Other things to note about Dad\u0092s health is he had renal failure with only right kidney functional, his both legs are still swollen (edema), his heart rate is high and he is very fatigued and nauseated.",

      "Content": "My father who is 72 in otherwise good health condition, recently complained about swelling in both the legs. Based on the doctor requested ultrasound which indicates \u0093probably prostate malignancy\u0094 and subsequently requested plain CT scan. CT scan revealed that ill-defined mass legion involving the prostate and posterior inferior wall of urinary bladder. The approximate measure 10.4 x 11.3 x 8.3 cm in size. Both UV junction appeared involved. Multiple enlarged lymph node seen in pre and para aortic, pre and paracaval, left and right common iliac, left and right internal iliac and pre sacral region. Mild to moderate dilatation of both pelvi-calyceal system and utheter. We have PSA test tomorrow. Is this stage IV? Is it curable? What are the next steps for us?",
