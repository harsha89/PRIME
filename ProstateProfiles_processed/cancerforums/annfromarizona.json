Two weeks later, he began experiencing a burning pain in the left side of his groin. It is intermittent but has become more severe and it's happening more often. We finally reached his RO who said she would confer with his surgeon and call back. Yesterday we received a call from her office saying the surgeon wants to see Frank.

Hang in there and let's see if some comments come in over the next few days from someone with a similar situation. As the others have said, this does sound unusual. Any side effects from radiation usually happen a year or longer after the treatment, although this case could be different since your husband's radiation was a follow-up from surgery instead of the primary treatment. The hernia idea suggested by one of the others sounds like it could be a possible answer. Please let us know what the doctor says. Good luck!
