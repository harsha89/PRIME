      "Content": "nysupraman; Good timing. I haven't looked at this site for over a week. I had surgery at Cleveland Clinic 3 weeks ago. I decided surgery was the way to go and to keep me positive wanted to know I had the best going in. Cleveland Clinic is rated #1 Urology Hospital by US News. I had my consultation and surgery with Dr. Eric Klein who is also the Chairman of Urology and Professor of Surgery. He does the open surgery and has preformed over 3,000 procedures. His positive margins are less than 2% which is by far the lowest I have heard. Open is said to have more bleeding and slower recovery which is really not important when you consider they recycle the blood and I returned to work 2 weeks after surgery (I'm not overweight and in good health). I also can say I was 100% continent when the catheter was removed and remain so. I've talked to two people who had the robotic surgery at Cleveland and while they had good results were not 100% continent like me. This could be due to the individual and some I think is the surgeon. I went in Gleason 3+3 and the pathology showed negative margins but a Gleason 4+3 which is a fair amount more aggressive. The point here is not to delay the surgery potentially allowing the cancer to spread outside the prostate. You will be in good hands at Cleveland and especially Dr Klein if you chose to go with him. Let me know if you have any questions. Greg",

      "Content": "Chuck; First; I noticed we are located not too far apart with my location in the Chicago western suburbs. Since Friday have have accomplished quite a bit. I have contacted Cleveland Clinic and will be doing a consultation with Dr. Eric klein. His assistant has requested all my doctor notes, bone scan, pathology report and the biopsy slides sent to him. Eric did my brother-in-law's prostactomy 12 years ago and as you may know is highly regarded. I will be meeting with him in the next few weeks. I was leaning to the surgery and then this morning came back on the fence after a meeting with Chicago Prostate a clinic which only does brachytherapy. Dr. Brian Moran, who I hear is also highly regarded showed me some studies and comparisons with the Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Moran does 30 brachytherapies per week and has done thousands including some from with people from other countries. He said my status is very early and projected 98% probable cure rate. He said they have no bowel issues and in the worst case a catheter for 1-2weeks. He did a DRE in the office and doesn't think my prostate is 122 grams. My report also showed 70 grams and thinks this might be close to actual. He said if I want to consider brachytherapy they would first do an ultrasound of my prostate to see if I'm a good candidate. Moran also gave me 3-4 names of excellant surgeons in the Chicago area in case I wanted to stay locally. Your suggestion rearding timing is hitting home and I will check out both treatments more throughly.",
