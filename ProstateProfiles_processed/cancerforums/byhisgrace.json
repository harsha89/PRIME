      "Content": "Thank you so much for that information. Supposedly when your prostate shrinks, it's easier to see and find prostate cancer if there is any....which makes sense. If you don't mind letting me know how your 3T MRI turns out, I would appreciate it. It would be helpful to know if the shrinking of your prostate makes it easier for doctors to see your prostate. Have you ever had a biopsy or a 3T MRI before? How long will you be on Finasteride? I'm glad that your PSA dropped by more than half, which means you probably don't have prostate cancer.....and thanks again for your help...",

      "Content": "Hi, The doctor wants to put him on finasteride. He says that if my husband does NOT have prostate cancer, his PSA should go down by about half. However, if he has prostate cancer then his PSA won't go down as much. A prior study indicated that finasteride induces aggressive prostate cancer. Doctor says a new study says it's just that finasteride shrunk the prostate and made finding prostate cancer easier, not that it caused aggressive prostate cancer. However, some websites still are skeptical about new research. Has anyone taken finasteride for this purpose?.....to try to determine if you had cancer? ....did it worK?....do you regret taking it? Did it induce aggressive prostate cancer? Please help with your advice. I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much",
