      "Content": "Hi, I have a bunch of questions about the radical prostatectomy. Some quick facts: 45 years old, PSA: 5.89, Gleason: 3+4=7, 6 of 12 cores positive (all left side), T2A I have spoken with several urologists sharing the quick data above and all have said radical is the route given my age - makes sense. My questions are about which procedure and finding the right surgeon. I am in the Chicago area but will travel to make sure I get the best outcome. Can y'all (I am originally from Texas - so I am qualified to use y'all) share your thoughts or direct me to some threads on the following questions: - open vs. robotic - how hard is it to have the procedure away from home both from the immediate time of the procedure as well as post-op follow ups? - For the Chicago area, which surgeon have you had good experience with? Thanks in advance!",
