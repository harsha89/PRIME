Because of this condition, one of the surgeons I consulted, recommended that I avoid radiation. He stated that radiation can impact the rectum, and I should avoid such with UC. 2. I also take Propecia for the treatment of male pattern hair loss. The uro that performed my biopsy told me that my \"true\" PSA reading was actually around 9.6. 3. Prostate cancer runs in my family on my father's side. My grandfather and several of his siblings had PC. My father has BPH, and keeps an active check on his prostate.
