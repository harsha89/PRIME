The Viagra does make may head feel a little funny, but that is about it as far as undesired side effects. Like anything, everyone has his own tolerance level. Did my head feel extra funny with the CLA + Viagra....maybe a little worse, but if that is what it takes to get a hard on....I can take it! lol Before the prostate cancer I used to take Cialis with no side effects, but at a low dosage. My quest is to find something, other than a giant needle stuck into my penis, that can get me laid again, so any boost to the Viagra (which works marginally in me) is welcome",
