      "Content": "Fortunately, this is my bi-weekly mowing season, my buddy took care of my business while I was recovering for the last 5 weeks. This week is my first week back, next week I will be relaxing again. So far so good (45 lawns done over the last few days) no problems, so far, just a little slower, but I put that down to my caring customers coming out to see me and ask how I am. They are ace to be honest During the 5 weeks downtime, I was very persistent in walking 3 miles daily, which I'm glad I did because i feel its helped in getting back to work this quick Next, check up Dec 19 with PSA test done just prior fingers crossed",

      "Content": "Hi all Just an update Surgery was October 27, 2017. Quarterly Uro visits thereafter. So far so good. Most recent visit was October 11, 2018... Lab work performed October 1 by Quest diagnostics locally. PSA Total <0.1. Completely dry after around 3 weeks post-op. ED still battling, but getting better. Thank, goodness for Sams club where I get the generic sildenafil Uro told me after surgery I had a very slight perineural invasion, but that hasn't raised its head to date. Also told me I had a hernia, but said not to worry about that until it becomes a distinct problem. Which now the dull constant ache in my right side groin has become very annoying, going to look to see a doc about that early new year Everything else is fine. I'm glad I ultimately chose De Vinci surgery Good look and god bless to this forum and members you are the best. XXXXX",

I was having Nocturnal Erections and thought YEEEESS he's coming back to life sadly they diminished quickly. Viagara, Cialis they really haven't done anything other than give me a thumping headache or heartburn Without being too crude...There's only so many things you can can perform sexually without the aid of an erection before it becomes boring or \"im too tired tonight babe\". I appreciate its a healing process and im probably trying to run before i can walk but it is becoming an ongoing concern in my mind daily Thanks PS got my first major review post op on Friday with PSA test results.. I'm going to mention it to the doc",

      "Content": "First post guys. I'm a 49 year old male looking down the barrel of the dreaded 50 in October this year. Anyway last November my wife and i were on a cruise with our best friends that flew over to FL from UK. I noticed halfway in to it that i was peeing excessively i asked my buddy if he was experiencing similar and he said yes so i put it down to partying hard lol. So it carried on after and it became a concern to me as back when i was 14 i had a kidney removed due to a defect in the tube from birth so im thinking whats going on So i went to my docs who performed blood tests urine tests ultrasound etc, results back were Micro blood in urine, enlarged prostate, kidney and bladder. PSA was at 4.5. So they put me on flowmax went for follow with still same symptoms, then they ordered a blood work full prostate diagnosis. Results came back so in a approx a month my PSA had risen to 5.9, same symptoms etc etc. So doc referred me to urologist. Went to see him last wednesday, did a prostate exam ( most painful experience ive ever had) . So he ordered another ultrasound then a camera thingy up my ding dong and biopsies. Today went for ultra sound, tomorrow camera and next week biopsie Can anyone give me solace because im so worried about the biopsies...is it painful etc ...recoup time...what should i expect or ask Thanks for you advice in advance",

Anyway last November my wife and i were on a cruise with our best friends that flew over to FL from UK. I noticed halfway in to it that i was peeing excessively i asked my buddy if he was experiencing similar and he said yes so i put it down to partying hard lol. So it carried on after and it became a concern to me as back when i was 14 i had a kidney removed due to a defect in the tube from birth so im thinking whats going on So i went to my docs who performed blood tests urine tests ultrasound etc, results back were Micro blood in urine, enlarged prostate, kidney and bladder. PSA was at 4.5. So they put me on flowmax went for follow with still same symptoms, then they ordered a blood work full prostate diagnosis. Results came back so in a approx a month my PSA had risen to 5.9, same symptoms etc etc. So doc referred me to urologist. Went to see him last wednesday, did a prostate exam ( most painful experience ive ever had) . So he ordered another ultrasound then a camera thingy up my ding dong and biopsies. Today went for ultra sound, tomorrow camera and next week biopsie Can anyone give me solace because im so worried about the biopsies...is it painful etc ...recoup time...what should i expect or ask Thanks for you advice in advance",

      "Content": "First post guys. I'm a 49 year old male looking down the barrel of the dreaded 50 in October this year. Anyway last November my wife and i were on a cruise with our best friends that flew over to FL from UK. I noticed halfway in to it that i was peeing excessively i asked my buddy if he was experiencing similar and he said yes so i put it down to partying hard lol. So it carried on after and it became a concern to me as back when i was 14 i had a kidney removed due to a defect in the tube from birth so im thinking whats going on So i went to my docs who performed blood tests urine tests ultrasound etc, results back were Micro blood in urine, enlarged prostate, kidney and bladder. PSA was at 4.5. So they put me on flowmax went for follow with still same symptoms, then they ordered a blood work full prostate diagnosis. Results came back so in a approx a month my PSA had risen to 5.9, same symptoms etc etc. So doc referred me to urologist. Went to see him last wednesday, did a prostate exam ( most painful experience ive ever had) . So he ordered another ultrasound then a camera thingy up my ding dong and biopsies. Today went for ultra sound, tomorrow camera and next week biopsie Can anyone give me solace because im so worried about the biopsies...is it painful etc ...recoup time...what should i expect or ask Thanks for you advice in advance",

      "Content": "First post guys. I'm a 49 year old male looking down the barrel of the dreaded 50 in October this year. Anyway last November my wife and i were on a cruise with our best friends that flew over to FL from UK. I noticed halfway in to it that i was peeing excessively i asked my buddy if he was experiencing similar and he said yes so i put it down to partying hard lol. So it carried on after and it became a concern to me as back when i was 14 i had a kidney removed due to a defect in the tube from birth so im thinking whats going on So i went to my docs who performed blood tests urine tests ultrasound etc, results back were Micro blood in urine, enlarged prostate, kidney and bladder. PSA was at 4.5. So they put me on flowmax went for follow with still same symptoms, then they ordered a blood work full prostate diagnosis. Results came back so in a approx a month my PSA had risen to 5.9, same symptoms etc etc. So doc referred me to urologist. Went to see him last wednesday, did a prostate exam ( most painful experience ive ever had) . So he ordered another ultrasound then a camera thingy up my ding dong and biopsies. Today went for ultra sound, tomorrow camera and next week biopsie Can anyone give me solace because im so worried about the biopsies...is it painful etc ...recoup time...what should i expect or ask Thanks for you advice in advance",

      "Content": "First post guys. I'm a 49 year old male looking down the barrel of the dreaded 50 in October this year. Anyway last November my wife and i were on a cruise with our best friends that flew over to FL from UK. I noticed halfway in to it that i was peeing excessively i asked my buddy if he was experiencing similar and he said yes so i put it down to partying hard lol. So it carried on after and it became a concern to me as back when i was 14 i had a kidney removed due to a defect in the tube from birth so im thinking whats going on So i went to my docs who performed blood tests urine tests ultrasound etc, results back were Micro blood in urine, enlarged prostate, kidney and bladder. PSA was at 4.5. So they put me on flowmax went for follow with still same symptoms, then they ordered a blood work full prostate diagnosis. Results came back so in a approx a month my PSA had risen to 5.9, same symptoms etc etc. So doc referred me to urologist. Went to see him last wednesday, did a prostate exam ( most painful experience ive ever had) . So he ordered another ultrasound then a camera thingy up my ding dong and biopsies. Today went for ultra sound, tomorrow camera and next week biopsie Can anyone give me solace because im so worried about the biopsies...is it painful etc ...recoup time...what should i expect or ask Thanks for you advice in advance",
