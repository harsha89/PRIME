      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Usually, when you are on HT, the effects of testosterone depletion far overshadow any side-effects caused by the drugs themselves...The fact that your PSA dropped to undetectable at 12 weeks is a very good sign. Your doctors may take a wait and see approach before moving on to RT & HT...... Zero at 12 weeks (before ADT) was indeed good news when you got a path report like mine. However, according to the Han tables and other predictors its not likely to stay at zero without treatment. The radiation onco wants to do 37 treatments (7 to the prostate fossa) and the regular onco wants to keep me on Lurpon for 2 years. I am, obviously, very concerned about the permanent side effects of this course of treatment. Early intervention with Lupron is a no brainer. Not sure if I should wait until something shows up on a scan before doing radiation. The radiation onco does not want to wait for that. But I want to give myself more time to heal up and everything down there IS healing, slowly but surely --so far. What would you do?",
