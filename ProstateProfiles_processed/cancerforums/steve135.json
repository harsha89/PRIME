Just good to know I have support. steve Originally Posted by Michael F Welcome Steve! The Auxumin Trial resulted in it being cleared by the FDA to identify/locate recurrent PC. If you are in fact being offered enrollment into a continuing investgative trial keep in mind that you may be randomized and thus will only have a 50% chance of being in the Auxumin wing of the trial. 5 years ago, I was \"worked up\" at Emory to enroll in an Auxumin trial. Since my PSA was < 0.05ng/ml I did not qualify. Chuck & Jim: The Auxumin wing includes a PET scan to detect areas of recurrence. Only those areas get \"focally\" radiated. The non Auxumin wing receives the standard radiation protocol for recurrent PC (the entire prostate bed). Thus Steve will likely receive radiation fairly soon. A \"silent\" Forum Brother experienced a rising PSA and had the Auxumin PET scan. It found an inconclusive lymph node that the MDs deemed suspicious. This led to a CT guided Bx of the node last Monday. If (+) he will receive 40 treatments that focus on the node (and likely some neighboring geography) Steve: I can put you in touch with him. Good luck. Hope they pinpoint locate the culprit & then pinpoint destroy it! MF",

      "Content": "Sorry for not explaining completely the requirements to get in the trial are medical, such as PSA levels at time recurrence,age, not having treatments is one also. The delay in treatment will be about 11 days. This trial has resulted in finding the cancer recurrence many times is NOT in the prostate bed. Which salvage Radiation to the bed would have cause a 2 month delay. I met with the oncologist and she felt the short delay wasn't a big issue. The trial is two visits once on Friday the 17th and then 6 months later to see the results. On Monday the 19th I start the radiation therapy. If its found not to be in the Bed then they will need to change the plans. If it is in the Bed they will have a visual of the actual site with a size and shape. I am comfortable with the delay. The doctors feelings are its recurred very aggressive like the first and if we miss it by point and hope we hit something, the trial was a good idea in my case. one of the his trials candidate found the spot just outside the bed area and may not have had good results without first seeing. steve",

      "Content": "Hi Throwaway, Sorry to hear you dad's story, just wait and see the results of biopsy. It could be a simple as he had sex the day of or before the PSA test. I hear these type results so often in the last year. I am beginning to believe that they don't tell men not to have sex so they can either get a another test done or biopsy. Hence another co-pay and charge to insurance and only than do they say oh by the way don't have sex before your test or it might spike. Several of my co workers have had this happen only to have no PC issues. steve",

      "Content": "Little background is in order. RALP Oct. 2015 Oct. 2016 PSA started to rise to .2 Three months later PSA .4 I know what your all thinking,something should have been done at .2 I believe my Urologist had a plan all along. He was the one of two trial studies at the time for a new drug that claimed to find PC in tissue and organs long before it showed as pain. They knew it was successful above 1.0 Half of the 330 positions had been used with men at .2 .3 and the results weren't showing promising. At .4 I enter the trial and by the time I got on the PET Scanner and had the drug trial I had reached .6 in a couple of weeks. The trial showed a 17.5 mm tumor being the most likely cause of the PSA This most likely from Perineural invasion. I then started 42 sessions of SR treatments with special attention to that spot in the rt. semi vascular bed ending in June of 2017 Today I received my first PSA results since ending SRT PSA .01 Which I'm told is zero. I'm so happy with my and doctors choices thus far in my treatment. Just waiting to get off the ADT treatment its really messing up sleep and my muscles feel like they aren't connected to my bones. I find it difficult at my work delivering mail,packages getting in and out of the truck going up stairs, 9/10 hours a day! Thanks for all who have helped me through my journey reading many of your post have kept me going. Hoping my good news gives other hope! Steve",

Taken 12 years to get up to .2 is what I've seen to be a normal progression after removal, if it going to show its ugly face again. SRT wasn't a big deal just a daily annoyance. I didn't see any mention of ADT/HT which has been an annoyance with me. Good luck and keep us all posted every bodies post keeps us well informed and helps us make our own decisions. steve",

I followed a similar path very aggressive PC. Recurrence only one year out from removal. I did a trial study to find the recurrence area and was glad I did as it wasn't located in the normal location, (prostate bed). I am quite sure the Axumin pet scan is now coded in most insurances. Its quite costly otherwise! It was able to locate my PC and hence Radiation followed. My first PSA 3 months since radiation was undetectable. I just did the second 6 month awaiting results, Dec.1 It may be worth asking your doctor about Axumin Pet Scanning. LINK DELETED BY MODERATOR BECAUSE IT LINKS TO A PRODUCT. PLEASE SEE BELOW -- CHUCK Good luck steve MODERATOR'S NOTE: While it is against forum rules to link to a product, I believe Steve's intention was to offer info on it. So I will copy-paste the text down below without exposing the contact info: INDICATION Axumin® (fluciclovine F 1 injection is indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in men with suspected prostate cancer recurrence based on elevated blood prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels following prior treatment. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Image interpretation errors can occur with Axumin PET imaging. A negative image does not rule out recurrent prostate cancer and a positive image does not confirm its presence. The performance of Axumin seems to be affected by PSA levels. Axumin uptake may occur with other cancers and benign prostatic hypertrophy in primary prostate cancer. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation, is recommended. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur in patients who receive Axumin. Emergency resuscitation equipment and personnel should be immediately available. Axumin use contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure, which is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Safe handling practices should be used to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and health care providers. Adverse reactions were reported in ≤1% of subjects during clinical studies with Axumin. The most common adverse reactions were injection site pain, injection site erythema and dysgeusia.",

Many men have a very low PSA reading and they still find cancer? In my case moving from 1.5 to 2.0 then 2.4 they biopsy 5 out of 10 for cancer. I have a family history of PC so each of us is a different case.

But in the two plus years he takes the time with me because I understand way too much more than,oh I have PC. It will both cause anxiety and relief knowing what's coming. Your able to say no or request different test if your able to show a reason, this can be good and bad. My Radiation Oncologist advised me not to waste time on the trial study about (3 weeks) since my PSA was raising about every 10 days by .1 In the end the location of my recurrence wasn't in the Prostate Bed as it often is and SRT is done, believe me I pointed this out to her on my pre-mapping day. I didn't get a response... Good Luck with the testing steve Side note: My PSA test came back .1 undetectable uPSA .006",

No telling if you elected not to have the treatments how you'll feel or if you be feeling anything 10 years down the road. There is no hard and fast rules on PCa. Patients surprise doctors by exceeding there life expectancy on some chart, just as patients never reach there life expectancy on that same chart!

      "Content": "From previous thread \"16 Month Recurrence from 0 to .4 \" I delayed SRT by about 14 days waiting for Axumin trial. Good news bad news... The results showed the location of the recurrence just outside the prostate bed they would have radiated. At the distal rectosigmoid, a suspected malignant nodule on the right 17.5mm in size demonstrates intense uptake likely source of patients rising PSA. This is situated roughly in the right seminal vesicle bed, right seminal vesicle removed during prostatectomy. The way it was explained was while in the area of prostate bed it would have mostly been missed with standard SRT as its located tucked up under bladder! While I have not seen the oncologist since report the UR says it may require radiation through bladder and hitting rectum which is never good. Maybe she has better plan? UR said new study using injections that move bladder out of the way have been tried? Other previous area's from two pet scans are deemed no abnormalities whatsoever, no obvious malignancy. So I feel I made the right call at this point in my treatment options. For those who might want to used this new type source to locate PC recurrence here is what I know. You may be able to pay your own way. Most insurance won't pay at this writing. You'll have to foot the bill, the injection of drug is just under 4k, then the cost of pet scan, which I think was 6k on my insurance forms? There still may be openings in the trial I was in but only doing 330 test I think I was 0117. And your insurance can/may be canceled if you enter this trial study, I had to sign I agreed to knowing this. I had thought I heard Medicare will pay sometimes. I heard they were trying to get Axumin its own insurance code in hopes of more companies adding it on? Only 10 states doing trial.

I was in a trial group no cost to me or my insurance. My insurance has not balked at any request yet. I have had no treatments since removal I am going to check about surgery before SRT as an option. I know after SRT removal isn't an option. steve",

      "Content": "\"Thanks, Steve. Was your constant result 0.006 or <0.006, as is in your signature? The less-than sign means that the uPSA used cannot accurately distinguish quantities below 0.006. So your numbers may actually not be constant, but rather fluctuating at values below 0.006.\" Yes I omitted < in my previous post. There may be fluctuation below .006 but it clearly shows no rise. One is to then ask can they read a number below <.006 Lab test vary simply by who\"s doing the testing! I myself am quite happy if its moving around below <.006 at this time!",

For me, I am planning to go Houston MD Anderson Cancer Center to seek the best treatment. I did have very low pressure while peeing. I had a very week erection getting worse. I had spend a couple of years doing a flow rate test, had a sigmoidoscopy determined nothing wrong with bladder or obstruction . It was about then the first rise in PSA occurred I had never had movement in PSA. My dad and grandfather both had PC another reason for the concern. steve",

In other countries its as high as 10.0. There are also other factors, like how fast it went from one test to another, if it keeps rising. DRE. Each person is different as is each doctor. Also its about insurance companies, they just won't pay for test till numbers are reached. With me going from 1.5 to 2.0 was odd 2.0 to 2.4 was odder. The doctor said insurance won't pay for biopsy till it goes higher. I told him but I will pay. Biopsy showed cancer. Submitted to insurance they paid.
