      "Content": "Well, first post surgery post, had the catheter removed today which is nice, on the other hand, the pathology report has me at stage p3ta pN0. I'd be very interested in any input. I have a great doctor I think, but he is very abrupt and we were sort of left wondering what all this means. I can find online where this staging means the cancer is? was ? outside the prostate, but what does that mean, did he get it all? The report mentions angiolymphatic invasion, but not sure what that means or is indicative of. Finally, the report mentions that the extraprostatic extension was present along the right lobe along the lateral and posterior aspect. The doctor started out with \"I got all the cancer\" so that, negative margins and the Gleason staying at 3=4+7 seems good. My wife and are are at square one again and pretty pessimistic, this seems like not so good news.",

I have a great doctor I think, but he is very abrupt and we were sort of left wondering what all this means. I can find online where this staging means the cancer is? was ? outside the prostate, but what does that mean, did he get it all? The report mentions angiolymphatic invasion, but not sure what that means or is indicative of. Finally, the report mentions that the extraprostatic extension was present along the right lobe along the lateral and posterior aspect. The doctor started out with \"I got all the cancer\" so that, negative margins and the Gleason staying at 3=4+7 seems good. My wife and are are at square one again and pretty pessimistic, this seems like not so good news.",

I posted earlier on about my pathology report, and now that I've had some time to get my head around it, at least a little bit, the only part that truly has me concerned is the \"Angiolymhatic invasion present\" part of the report. After much googling, I just can't come up with a lot of information. Is it the same thing as Lymphovascular Invasion or LVI? It's a little confusing as the lymph nodes that they took were apparently clear. Anyone had any experience with this? It's got me pretty worried? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

      "Content": "Creekrat, I've probably read all this advice or similar 100 times in the last 5 months & it's all very true & correct. But somehow, I, and I sense a lot of others, don't \"get it till you live it\" It is a slooooooooow process (and I'm nowhere near the end). Just keep telling your brother to keep with the patience when he gets frustrated with the inevitable spills drips & runs. And, at least for me, when I think I've got it, it jumps up and gets me when I least expect it. I've also tried to make the worry about my future with PC somewhat constructive, and every time I find myself worrying about the future, recurrence, or peeing my pants, I do kegals. At least I get something out of the anxiety! Working on that too. My timeline, 3 months, I could pretty much strain IF I thought about it in advance without incident, now at 5 months, dry at night, and mostly in the day, except a lot of \"mystery spots\" where I never knew when it happened, but I suspect it's mostly from impatience before stepping away from the toilet. I also saw some useful posts on here on getting all the urine out when using the bathroom, still working on that and maybe one of the more experienced guys on here can post links to that? I seem to remember the phrase \"milking\" perhaps you can search this forum on that, it seemed like pretty good advice. Also, for me personally, I'm fighting the battle between staying hydrated enough (never enough according to my doctor) and peeing every 5 minutes, but I suspect that's pretty normal too.",
