      "Content": "Thanks Bernard Started trying to get an appointment with a different urologist today. Hopefully one with fewer PA's. I seem to have spent most of the last 6 weeks arguing with semi-qualified people that I have a problem. The pain is really starting to get me down. Nothing prescribed even puts a dent in it. Including some extra label experiments with Percocet, which while it will put you to sleep won't stop the burning pain. The procedure earlier this week (Urethrostomy I think) just made the urinating pain more acute not to mention the self-cath which I must be doing wrong as other posts talk about being not too bad, is breathtaking in the extreme. thanks again for a great forum and sharing your thoughts and ideas. Misery shared is misery halved?",

      "Content": "Wondering if anyone can share experiences. I had DaVinci on July 6th, by all accounts surgery went extremely well, only real pain was from the Foley catheter. Became inflamed and extremely painful. Foley was removed on July 11th. Pain at urination was immediately extreme and hasn't really gotten any better. Initially treatment was given for bladder spasms and was told the pain was \"radiating\" from that. Over the next 5 weeks flow was reduced more and more until it would take 20 minutes to empty bladder. On the 15th my Urologist tried to use dilators to increase opening (and yes that is as much fun as it sounds) with no success, was immediately scheduled for surgery to open the stricture the next day at 7 under general anaesthetic with a follow up visit at 3pm later that same day. During the follow up visit the Foley catheter(silicon this time) was removed and I was \"Taught\" how to self-cath to keep the stricture open. Asked the PA how long I would have to do this and was looked at like it was a stupid question and informed permanently. To say that this was a surprise to my wife and I would be the understatement of the year. Reading some of the posts on hear I feel I should be grateful for the result, No incontinence, Mr. Ed is working at about 80% but struggling to be excited about and erection that is too painful to do anything with. But after 6 weeks of eye watering pain every time I urinate and now being told will have to poke a 5.3 mm piece of plastic into my oldest and dearest friend in the eye for the remainder of my time on this planet I've reached breaking point. I haven't been able to find anyone with similar experiences, the Urologist said that in his 1700+ prostatectomy he has never come across this problem. Has anyone had a similar problem thanks for reading my vent.",

      "Content": "Hi Rich This is also my first post although I have been following the forums with interest since diagnosed with PC in late April. I had just turned 50 when a DRE revealed a suspicious nodule in April PSA was only 2.7. Subsequent biopsy results 3 of 12 cores positive. 2 were 3+3 both less than 10% one core 3+4 75%. Had Robotic Radical prostatectomy on the 7th of July. Subsequent pathology after surgery downgraded Gleason to 3+3. The decision on treatment is a personal choice that you have to make, I would only urge you to think long and hard. The knee jerk reaction when we hear the \"C\" word is to get it out at all costs. But there is no going back once it is done. You now know the disease is present, it is a slow developing disease, there seems to be an attitude that because you are \"young\" you will get over the surgery well. This may be true but life WILL NOT be the same after surgery. Everyone's recovery is different, but the ones who say it was nothing, who say life is the same, are the very small minority. I had decided not to have surgery but finally agreed after pressure from Family, Friends and the Urologist. Three painful, miserable and uncomfortable weeks on I now feel I have made the biggest mistake of my life. Get as many opinions as you can, but ultimately the decision has to be yours.

      "Content": "Hi Drbbt, Welcome to the forum and sorry for your diagnosis. I'm just a couple years older than you and about 4 months further down the PC journey than you. You have a very difficult decision to make. Opinions are like asses, everyone has one, but just a few thoughts. PC is in the vast majority of cases is not the rapid silent killer that our human conditioning leads us to fear every time we hear the C word. Urologists love doing RRP, some of them are very good at it with fantastic results, they will push you to have a surgery. The medical profession has made huge leaps and I am sure will continue to do so in treating all kinds of diseases, but RP will change your life forever. If you believe in statistics the benefit of RRP can be fairly obscure, A trial in Sweden that tracked 347 men diagnosed with PC for 15 years with or without RP showed only a 6% difference in mortality at 15 years. If your go to www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate, Sloan Kettering has a prediction tool that allows you to put in your own information and diagnosis to see the survivability of 100 men with your diagnosis who elected not to have surgery at 5 and 15 years. I had a great surgeon, was dry from catheter removal, had some signs of life from my best friend within days of surgery, was able to have chemically assisted relations with my wife 3 weeks after surgery, the only persistent problem was extremely painful urination. Now 7 weeks after surgery have had a second surgery to try to remove scar tissue in Urethra and am self-catheterizing twice a day to try to prevent scar tissue blocking again (and no, that is definitely not fun). Have been told by the same great surgeon that I may have to do this for the rest of my life (Talking to a different Urologist now). The side effects can REALLY suck! UF did a study on 1400 RRP survivors and a scary 72% said the side effects were worse than expected, now I'm sure some of this is because many don't take the important steps of looking at options and researching that you obviously are. But 72% is a big number. Good luck making the best decision for you.",

      "Content": "Hi Matt Sorry to hear you have joined the club, but welcome anyway. I'm about 3 months further down the path than you. Good to see you're doing plenty of research, now the hard part will be winnowing the wheat from the chaff. Just a few thoughts. The ED figures you are quoting are definitely chemically enhanced. Resist the urge to panic, in the vast majority of cases Prostate cancer is slow developing. A useful tool which I unfortunately only found after I was convinced to undergo RRP can be found at Memorial Sloan Kettering's website. They have a series of prediction tools that I'm sure an engineer should be able to appreciate. www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate. You can put your own numbers into the tools and see how things look. I'm fairly sure with your numbers that even 15 years out if left untreated you would be 5 to 10 times more likely to be dead from some other cause. Good luck with your decision process.",

      "Content": "Hi Matt Sorry to hear you have joined the club, but welcome anyway. I'm about 3 months further down the path than you. Good to see you're doing plenty of research, now the hard part will be winnowing the wheat from the chaff. Just a few thoughts. The ED figures you are quoting are definitely chemically enhanced. Resist the urge to panic, in the vast majority of cases Prostate cancer is slow developing. A useful tool which I unfortunately only found after I was convinced to undergo RRP can be found at Memorial Sloan Kettering's website. They have a series of prediction tools that I'm sure an engineer should be able to appreciate. www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate. You can put your own numbers into the tools and see how things look. I'm fairly sure with your numbers that even 15 years out if left untreated you would be 5 to 10 times more likely to be dead from some other cause. Good luck with your decision process.",

This may be true but life WILL NOT be the same after surgery....Everyone's recovery is different, but the ones who say it was nothing, who say life is the same, are the very small minority. I had decided not to have surgery but finally agreed after pressure from Family, Friends and the Urologist....I had decided not to have surgery but finally agreed after pressure from Family, Friends and the Urologist. Three painful, miserable and uncomfortable weeks on I now feel I have made the biggest mistake of my life....UF did a study on 1400 RRP survivors and a scary 72% said the side effects were worse than expected, now I'm sure some of this is because many don't take the important steps of looking at options and researching that you obviously are. But 72% is a big number....Sloan Kettering has a prediction tool that allows you to put in your own information and diagnosis to see the survivability of 100 men with your diagnosis who elected not to have surgery at 5 and 15 years. I had a great surgeon, was dry from catheter removal, had some signs of life from my best friend within days of surgery, was able to have chemically assisted relations with my wife 3 weeks after surgery, the only persistent problem was extremely painful urination....",
