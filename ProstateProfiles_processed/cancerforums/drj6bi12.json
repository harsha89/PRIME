    "Content": "This will be my first post to anything such as this. I will not waste time and get right to the point of things. I am 61 years old and always had a check up as directed by my doctor. I was seeing this lady and she( being a nurse), wanted me to get checked one more time before we proceeded into our marriage. Understandable so I went. On Christmas eave 2015 the doctor called me and said i had cancer. Merry Christmas right. I proceeded to go through test as we all have done and when he came back and explained to me my P.S.A. scores were 20+. I new it was over for me. After the radical prostatectomy and no radiation treatment I am up and going. This within itself sounds good right? Well this is where we all have been and we all get hopes of a brighter future. One year later after we got married and we are doing well erections are not there at all, and bladder leakage is very bad and not getting much better at this time. The problems of intimacy with leakage is at best embarrassing and hard to deal with. Lets turn the clock forward for six months for the sake of details. Leakage is still bad and having to wear pads are very uncomfortable and embarrassing at times when they leak. Intimacy is not going to happen and I am finding myself loosing the desire to try anything because of the fear of not being able to perform. Psychologically I am a basket case and do not know how to handle the rejection my own body is placing on me. I am trying to write this in a way that I can relate to many men who are going from a viral sex life to a dead stop mental disconnect from our physical bodies. Fast forward to almost a two year period now. Leakage is still bad when I get up or set just right and all through the day when I am not constantly trying to control it. Sex is better but after two years you would think it would be more then that. Erections are not there like we had before even after Viagra, Cialis, Penal injections, and anything we can try naturally. The want to is there but the connection is not and is really getting to be a problem with both of us. She is starting to take it personal and so am I. we are both willing to try anything to help this feeling of emptiness and the void of this part of us that was removed. Erections are at best 45-50% of what they were before and this is with lots of effort and stimulation. We have found other ways to be satisfied but that still leaves a dark blank empty spot in your life. I am finding myself feeling like why even try any more as it will not work as before. These feelings are feelings that most guys will not admit or even think about posting on a sight like this. Depression is very prevalent and always popping its head up and mix this with the everyday problems you may have it is hard at best to manage your relationship with your souse. If it were as easy as taking a pill it would be a solved problem but its not. With that said at eight hundred to a thousand dollars a month for pills who can afford that. I hope to have a better report at the end of another six month period and still pray that things will turn around soon. Thanks for taking the time to read this and God Bless",
