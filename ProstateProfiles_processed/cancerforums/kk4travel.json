      "Content": "My Dad diagnosed with Prostate Cancer-so many questions-any advice, info, help? My Dad is 62 and was diagnosed with prostate cancer. His PSA is 14 and his Gleason is 7 (4+3). Cones were removed...on one side 3 were 100% and 2 were 90%. On the other side they were 0%, so, it appears it is all on the right side. He has scheduled surgery, but, is torn between that and radiation and hormone treatment. What option have others gone with? How are the side effects? He is especially worried about incontinence and impotence. He is in great shape and is very active. All information and experiences with the above options would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
