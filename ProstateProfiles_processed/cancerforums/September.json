      "Content": "Hubby has been seeing the oncologist at UofM. He has been monitoring him over the last year. PSA is on a steady rise. Two scans later bone and abdominal (February and September) we have located where it has spread. Small spot lit up, lower back, in the sacrum. While at last appointment, hubby was asked if he would be interested in doing a clinical research trial. It could help him (or so he said) to locate any other areas of concern. The trial is called PyL. There are a few articles on the net that we have been reading about. It involves them injecting, and doing a different kind of scan. Also a bone biopsy to study. Although it may be beneficial, hubby is leaning towards NOT being in this trial. I didn't think a bone biopsy sounded like fun. Anyone else do one of these? If only one spot shows up, doctor said they could radiate it. We are very doubtful that there is only one. We return to UofM next week, with a decision. Looks like hormones are next.",

      "Content": "Hubby saw uroligist for his 6 mt check up., and his psa has risen. Every time we went it was good news, until NOW. Doctor said we could do one of two things. Check it again in 2 mts just to see if it continues to rise, or start hormone therapy. Hubby right then and there said hormone therapy. I came home and read the chapter in Walsh book, and he doesn't lean towards hormone therapy at this time even when psa rises. Later yes, when things really RISE. We were very hopeful that perhaps the surgery and radiation had killed the beast. So much for our positive thinking. Any insight? Hubby read the part about 'man boobs' so he is going for radiation on his chest. (need to change the info at the bottom after I remember how. Hubby did radiation 6 mts after surgery.",
