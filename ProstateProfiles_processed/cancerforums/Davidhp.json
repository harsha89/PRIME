      "Content": "I just had the open surgery to remove my prostate and four lymph nodes on August 21st, my gleason was a 3+3 = 6. I had a postive biopsy for one core. I got the post surgery pathology report today and there were no indications that the cancer spread out of my prostate so it looks like the surgeon got all the cancer. I don't have the experience of many of the posters here, but I know I am happy that I had the surgery as prostate cancer took my father and both my first cousins. It is too early for me to tell if I have the negative side effects possible with the surgery, but I can tell you this, getting rid of the cancer was my priority and I will be alive to deal with any consequences and I will deal with those if necessary, but I will be alive.",
