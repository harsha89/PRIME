      "Content": "I was going over my pathology report before my meeting with doc tomorrow. My report states: The tumor infiltrates as discrete, infiltrative, compressed, irregular glands as well as cribriforming sheets and glomeruloid structures and involves the prostate bilaterally from apex to mid-base. I have been researching cribriforming cancer and found the following studies and info: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25189638 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4656017/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5861292/ https://www.archivesofpathology.org/...a.2018-0005-RA https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4779761/ The first article states: In conclusion, cribriform growth in Gleason grade 4 is a strong prognostic marker for distant metastasis and disease-specific death in patients with Gleason score 7 prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy. It seems that fairly recently, the staging and reporting of prostate cancer has changed and it has been recommended that cribriforming patterns be reported on biopsy and pathology reports (as gleason 4). I'm certainly going to go over this with my doc and maybe get some more info from the pathologist. One of the articles linked above states that in the study, they measured the area of cribriforming cancer and found that when the sample had greater than or equal to 25 square mm of cribriforming pattern, all subjects (100%) had verified metastasis. Not looking good for me. I find it interesting to see how the diagnosing, reporting and grading of prostate cancer is changing. I also researched glomeruloid structures but there is no conclusive data on prognosis other than it's associated with more aggressive forms of cancer. I find this fascinating.",

He noted that during nerve sparing, the nerves peeled right off with zero problems. Today is six weeks post RP. The instructions from the hospital said my first PSA will be at three months. I guess if I want, I could have my family doc order a uPSA test and I could check it on my own. After reading all the literature on cribriform growth patterns, my expectations are that my PSA will not be zero. If it is zero, that will be icing on the cake. I hate icing.

      "Content": "I was going over my pathology report before my meeting with doc tomorrow. My report states: The tumor infiltrates as discrete, infiltrative, compressed, irregular glands as well as cribriforming sheets and glomeruloid structures and involves the prostate bilaterally from apex to mid-base. I have been researching cribriforming cancer and found the following studies and info: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25189638 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4656017/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5861292/ https://www.archivesofpathology.org/...a.2018-0005-RA https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4779761/ The first article states: In conclusion, cribriform growth in Gleason grade 4 is a strong prognostic marker for distant metastasis and disease-specific death in patients with Gleason score 7 prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy. It seems that fairly recently, the staging and reporting of prostate cancer has changed and it has been recommended that cribriforming patterns be reported on biopsy and pathology reports (as gleason 4). I'm certainly going to go over this with my doc and maybe get some more info from the pathologist. One of the articles linked above states that in the study, they measured the area of cribriforming cancer and found that when the sample had greater than or equal to 25 square mm of cribriforming pattern, all subjects (100%) had verified metastasis. Not looking good for me. I find it interesting to see how the diagnosing, reporting and grading of prostate cancer is changing. I also researched glomeruloid structures but there is no conclusive data on prognosis other than it's associated with more aggressive forms of cancer. I find this fascinating.",

He noted that during nerve sparing, the nerves peeled right off with zero problems. Today is six weeks post RP. The instructions from the hospital said my first PSA will be at three months. I guess if I want, I could have my family doc order a uPSA test and I could check it on my own. After reading all the literature on cribriform growth patterns, my expectations are that my PSA will not be zero. If it is zero, that will be icing on the cake. I hate icing. Maybe ice cream on the cake. I have been wrestling with what to do if I have metastasis.",

      "Content": "da Vinci scheduled for January 9. I've settled on Dr. Michael Mangelson because he did his residency at Mayo Clinic and he helped pioneer a new way of doing the operation that produces a better outcome for continence. I even asked him about doing kegel exercises in prep for surgery and he said don't bother. I've been doing them anyway. I've been through multiple hernia surgeries, both laparoscopic and open, and I know all about having a sore abdomen for several weeks. Back then the nurses instructed me on how to get up and down without using my abs which really helped. I just hope the da Vinci prostatectomy is not as bad as my hernia surgeries. I can't go through that again. I checked with my hernia surgeon and he told me not to worry about the previous surgeries and the mesh. He said the prostatectomy is on a completely different plane than the hernia surgeries. I have read a LOT of threads on the da Vinci prostatectomy on this forum and about what to expect. I have two concerns: 1) I don't own a recliner and 2) I'm going to have to take care of myself most of the time. I have some friends coming to stay with me but I am on my own when it comes to managing the catheter and bag. This concerns me. From what I have read here, I need to keep the catheter clean and keep an antibacterial and/or numbing (lidocaine) ointment on the catheter at the tip of the penis. That's my biggest fear, keeping things clean and lubricated without passing out at the sight of blood. One thing confuses me. In all that I have read on this forum I see a lot of comments saying the surgery did not cause a lot of pain and many people just used over the counter pain relievers. But some of those same people talked about how sore their abs were and it made it difficult to get up and down. So I'm wondering if I use the heavy duty pain pills, can I alleviate the abdominal soreness? I'm a wimp when it comes to pain.",

I can make it to the toilet but this is going to make for some long nights. I can't hold much fluid before the urge hits. I'm assuming this is fairly normal. Can you folks talk about how long this frequent urination lasts? I may just set my timer to wake me up every hour to go. I'm not complaining. The urge feeling is a little painful but not a 10/10 on the pain scale. I can deal with this.",

I only have two minor complaints now and they are minor. A) When sitting or laying on back, the area where the prostate was is really sore. Can't sit or lay on back for long periods. B) The urethra exit point is sore and stings due to catheter contact. This has happened to me every time I have ever had a cath.

It doesn't hurt much but it sure feels weird. The assistant said if it keeps getting bigger they might have to take it out. It just keeps growing. I told her if it gets to the size of ping pong ball I'm calling to make an immediate appointment. It's supposed to be 72 degrees in a few days. I was going to break out the road bike and see how it goes. I can tell already this third testicle is going to be a problem.",

Today was the first time post RP (seven weeks) I have thought about it. I was shocked to find a raised area about 2mm high x 10mm long on the surface of one testicle. This is not normal at all. I can even see the outline of it through the skin. It's not a hard lump. It almost appears to be a plugged up, inflated channel of some sort. I realize the prostatectomy procedure seals off the Vas deferens. Maybe there is fluid backed up because everything is sealed up now. Don't know for sure. It's a 2 on the pain scale. Maybe time to alert the doc? Not sure if this is a normal post RP finding.",

      "Content": "Today marks three weeks post RALP. Although I had a rough start, things are getting better every day. Pain - No more severe retention pain. That stopped after the second cath removed. I still have some stinging sensation at the end of the urethra when I urinate but that seems to be getting better as of today. I feel sore when I try to contract my PC muscle so I don't do it. My entire urethra feels sore still. I did not think I would still be sore after three weeks. Lower abs are no longer sore. Sitting upright in a chair is still painful on the bladder area. Continence - I'm about 99% continent without doing anything. I have not been doing PC contractions like the doc said. Since I'm 99% continent I figured I'd wait until the soreness goes away. I've had enough pain to last me for a long time and I'm not going to add any extra at this point. Sexual function - Since last cath removal I've had multiple spontaneous erections flare up. I use the words \"flare up\" because they feel very uncomfortable. A little painful and very strange feeling. I try to put a stop to it ASAP. I guess the nerve sparing procedure worked so I should be happy about that. I think it's a testament to my surgeon's skill. At this point I will avoid erections as much as possible. I believe this is the opposite to what I'm supposed to be doing but again, my goal is to minimize pain and discomfort. Urinary frequency - I started out urinating on average about every 90 minutes for the first four days after cath removal. I started tracking it in an excel spreadsheet. After four days my average time between toilet breaks is has increased to 2.25 hours. If I drink a lot of water I can bump back down to every 90 minutes. Sleep - My sleep patterns are still bad right now. I tend to urinate more frequently at night and I can't seem to sleep more than two hours without waking up to go. For the past three weeks I have not have a good night's sleep. It's starting to affect me mentally. Now I know what parent's of newborn babies must feel like. Work - I will return to work soon. I have an IT job (computers) and I sit at my desk most of the day. I can alternate between sitting and standing but I also need to recline occasionally. I don't have a recliner at work. I tried a donut pillow made for people who had surgery but it doesn't help. The sitting issue is the only thing preventing me from going back to work. I did not think my bladder would still be this sore. Three weeks post RALP and things are getting better every day. This forum has helped me to get through the tough times post surgery so thank you to all who contribute to the forums.",

      "Content": "I had one question I forgot to ask the doc so I thought I'd ask it here. During the prostatectomy procedure, after the prostate is removed from the body, is there a pathologist standing by to perform a quick check to make sure the surgeon has clear margins? I was thinking I read some post on this forum where the surgeon had to wait to hear back from the pathologist before closing up. I was very curious about this because I'd hate for the surgeon to remove the prostate and not be sure he took a wide enough swath of tissue. I don't know how they know they got it or even if they can tell it's organ confined. I would feel better if I knew there was a pathologist standing by to check before I get closed up.",

      "Content": "I'm five weeks post RP and I've had some spontaneous semi-erections that hurt pretty bad. I do everything I can to put a stop to it. The pain centers around the shaft and base of the penis. It almost looks like there is a \"blowout\" trying to happen halfway down the shaft, like a weak spot in a balloon. Next week I have my six week checkup so I'll discuss it with the doc at that time. Not too worried about it right now as it's still early in the recovery. At least the good news is that erections are trying to happen without any input from me. I don't dare try to intentionally create an erection for fear of the pain.",

      "Content": "I'm 55 and for the last two years my PSA has been as high as 8.0. I live in Salt Lake City, Utah. My urologist wants me to have a random needle biopsy. While researching the subject I found the Prostate Cancer Research Institute's (pcri.org) youtube videos. Several of the videos highly recommend forgoing the random needle biopsy in favor of a multiparametric MRI on a 3-tesla scanner. The videos also say that it may be difficult to find a doctor who will do this. They also suggest you should find a new doctor if your current doc won't order the MRI. They have their reasons and they state them in the videos. I agree with the information presented in the videos so I set out to find a doc who will order a mp MRI on a 3-tesla scanner. Problem is I can't find one! One reason why is that not every healthcare facility has access to a 3-tesla MRI scanner. There are only three of them in the entire state where I live and the docs I have spoken with either 1) do not have the ability to order tests from them or 2) won't do it. Now I'm calling docs in other states where they have 3-tesla scanners. I'll have to fly to some other state any pay out of pocket. I'm really frustrated with this whole experience. I'm still looking. For those of you who had a 3t MRI for diagnosis, how did you find a doc that would order the test? You may be wondering, why did I have a PSA as high as 8 and wait two years to get serious about doing something. It's because my PSA has been bouncing around between 5 and 8. My doc said when you have prostate cancer, your PSA goes up, not up and down. I asked him if supplements can affect the PSA level and he said NO! I stopped taking the lycopene supplement and assumed I didn't have prostate cancer. After researching this on my own I think he was incorrect. Whenever I take lycopene consistently for several months, my PSA drops like a rock. When I stop, it shoots back up to as high as 8.0. I've done this twice over two years and this happened both times. It's possible this is all coincidence but the start and stop dates correlate the the PSA spikes and dips. I google searched prostate cancer and lycopene and found lycopene studies that fall into four categories: 1) lycopene did not affect PSA. 2) inconclusive 3) lycopene did have a statistically significant affect on PSA and 4) lycopene had a significant affect on PSA and the rate of decrease was accelerated the longer you took the supplement. So I don't know what to think. There is so much conflicting information out there. For now I'll keep taking the supplement. I'm just curious if any of you have had a conversation with your doctor about supplements and what did your doc say about it? In the mean time, I'm still calling out of state urology docs.",

      "Content": "I am collecting information on post-prostatectomy treatment options. My first PSA after surgery was 0.10 and I had a follow up PSA test three weeks later to verify. The second was 0.133. The second one I specifically asked for the actual lab report so there were no transcription errors. So I may have to make some decisions soon. There is one option that I have not read anything about at all. That option is to allow the disease process to follow its natural course. In other words, do nothing at all, seek no further treatment. I'm trying to find out if there are any general guidelines as to how long it would take before someone (post prostatectomy) started to present with symptoms of metastatic prostate cancer. I'm assuming the symptoms would be pain. There are so many variables that I don't think this question can be answered. It would depend on the grade/genetics of the cancer and where it metastasized among other things. In general, do people with BCR start having symptoms while the PSA is still low? I've heard of people being diagnosed with PSA scores in the hundreds because they had no symptoms. I'm trying to figure out if I can use PSA velocity and PSA doubling time to predict when symptoms will start showing up. My goal is to figure out if there is a way to predict how long I will have a good quality of life if I decline further treatment. If people say \"You won't notice anything until your PSA gets above 10\" then I can track my PSA results and predict how long it will take to get to 10. But then, I know there are too many variables in each individual case to make blanket statements like that. I'm just thinking out loud trying to figure out how to process the information. It's 1:45 AM so I don't know how coherent this post will be.",

      "Content": "I am collecting information on post-prostatectomy treatment options. My first PSA after surgery was 0.10 and I had a follow up PSA test three weeks later to verify. The second was 0.133. The second one I specifically asked for the actual lab report so there were no transcription errors. So I may have to make some decisions soon. There is one option that I have not read anything about at all. That option is to allow the disease process to follow its natural course. In other words, do nothing at all, seek no further treatment. I'm trying to find out if there are any general guidelines as to how long it would take before someone (post prostatectomy) started to present with symptoms of metastatic prostate cancer. I'm assuming the symptoms would be pain. There are so many variables that I don't think this question can be answered. It would depend on the grade/genetics of the cancer and where it metastasized among other things. In general, do people with BCR start having symptoms while the PSA is still low? I've heard of people being diagnosed with PSA scores in the hundreds because they had no symptoms. I'm trying to figure out if I can use PSA velocity and PSA doubling time to predict when symptoms will start showing up. My goal is to figure out if there is a way to predict how long I will have a good quality of life if I decline further treatment. If people say \"You won't notice anything until your PSA gets above 10\" then I can track my PSA results and predict how long it will take to get to 10. But then, I know there are too many variables in each individual case to make blanket statements like that. I'm just thinking out loud trying to figure out how to process the information. It's 1:45 AM so I don't know how coherent this post will be.",

      "Content": "I'm 55 and for the last two years my PSA has been as high as 8.0. I live in Salt Lake City, Utah. My urologist wants me to have a random needle biopsy. While researching the subject I found the Prostate Cancer Research Institute's (pcri.org) youtube videos. Several of the videos highly recommend forgoing the random needle biopsy in favor of a multiparametric MRI on a 3-tesla scanner. The videos also say that it may be difficult to find a doctor who will do this. They also suggest you should find a new doctor if your current doc won't order the MRI. They have their reasons and they state them in the videos. I agree with the information presented in the videos so I set out to find a doc who will order a mp MRI on a 3-tesla scanner. Problem is I can't find one! One reason why is that not every healthcare facility has access to a 3-tesla MRI scanner. There are only three of them in the entire state where I live and the docs I have spoken with either 1) do not have the ability to order tests from them or 2) won't do it. Now I'm calling docs in other states where they have 3-tesla scanners. I'll have to fly to some other state any pay out of pocket. I'm really frustrated with this whole experience. I'm still looking. For those of you who had a 3t MRI for diagnosis, how did you find a doc that would order the test? You may be wondering, why did I have a PSA as high as 8 and wait two years to get serious about doing something. It's because my PSA has been bouncing around between 5 and 8. My doc said when you have prostate cancer, your PSA goes up, not up and down. I asked him if supplements can affect the PSA level and he said NO! I stopped taking the lycopene supplement and assumed I didn't have prostate cancer. After researching this on my own I think he was incorrect. Whenever I take lycopene consistently for several months, my PSA drops like a rock. When I stop, it shoots back up to as high as 8.0. I've done this twice over two years and this happened both times. It's possible this is all coincidence but the start and stop dates correlate the the PSA spikes and dips. I google searched prostate cancer and lycopene and found lycopene studies that fall into four categories: 1) lycopene did not affect PSA. 2) inconclusive 3) lycopene did have a statistically significant affect on PSA and 4) lycopene had a significant affect on PSA and the rate of decrease was accelerated the longer you took the supplement. So I don't know what to think. There is so much conflicting information out there. For now I'll keep taking the supplement. I'm just curious if any of you have had a conversation with your doctor about supplements and what did your doc say about it? In the mean time, I'm still calling out of state urology docs.",

      "Content": "I am collecting information on post-prostatectomy treatment options. My first PSA after surgery was 0.10 and I had a follow up PSA test three weeks later to verify. The second was 0.133. The second one I specifically asked for the actual lab report so there were no transcription errors. So I may have to make some decisions soon. There is one option that I have not read anything about at all. That option is to allow the disease process to follow its natural course. In other words, do nothing at all, seek no further treatment. I'm trying to find out if there are any general guidelines as to how long it would take before someone (post prostatectomy) started to present with symptoms of metastatic prostate cancer. I'm assuming the symptoms would be pain. There are so many variables that I don't think this question can be answered. It would depend on the grade/genetics of the cancer and where it metastasized among other things. In general, do people with BCR start having symptoms while the PSA is still low? I've heard of people being diagnosed with PSA scores in the hundreds because they had no symptoms. I'm trying to figure out if I can use PSA velocity and PSA doubling time to predict when symptoms will start showing up. My goal is to figure out if there is a way to predict how long I will have a good quality of life if I decline further treatment. If people say \"You won't notice anything until your PSA gets above 10\" then I can track my PSA results and predict how long it will take to get to 10. But then, I know there are too many variables in each individual case to make blanket statements like that. I'm just thinking out loud trying to figure out how to process the information. It's 1:45 AM so I don't know how coherent this post will be.",

The following article doesn't paint a good picture: https://medivizor.com/blog/SampleLib...ular-invasion/ I meet with the doc next month to go over these details. I've read many posts on this forum that said not to wait on additional treatment. After surgery the doc said the procedure could not have gone any better. Everything peeled off the prostate nicely meaning there was no \"sticky\" cancer outside the capsule. He thinks I'm cured. However, the pathology report notes PNI and LVI as stated above. I'm looking into what options are next so I will be prepared and ready to go. Is there anybody on this forum that had both PNI and LVI and did NOT have metastasis?",

As soon as I'm empty I get severe pain quickly ramping up to a 10. I can hardly breathe and tense up. I feel like if this gets any worse I'm going to pass out. The intense pain lasts about five minutes and then diminishes to about a 7 for another five minutes. Then down to a 4 for five minutes. After about 20 minutes I'm completely back to normal. I'm going to contact doctor about this. The pain really is a 10. It's terrible. I can't handle this every three hours.",

      "Content": "I had my catheter removed today. The dye test showed no leaking. I have some issues I wanted to ask about. 1) After urinating, my bladder and urethra got very painful for about 20 minutes. I don't know if this is normal or not. This may be due to bladder spasms but not sure. I never took the spasm meds but I still have the full bottle. Should I take some? 2) The tip where the catheter entered the urethra stings like the dickens when the urine hits it. In a way this may be good because I get instant feedback when I'm leaking. I hope this clears up soon. 3) I found that I am compensating for the fact that I am expecting to leak. As as result, I am clenching my PC muscle all the time expecting to hold back a leak. My PC muscle is fatiguing because of this. This is causing discomfort. Should I just chill out and relax it and let the leaks happen? I will create my profile line later this week when I get to feeling better.",

I just wish the catheters were not uncomfortable. Not sleeping well. I'll be glad when this is over.",

      "Content": "OK, I have had to urinate three times since having the catheter removed. The same pattern happens every time. I relax the PC muscle completely and urine starts to flow. As soon as I'm empty I get severe pain quickly ramping up to a 10. I can hardly breathe and tense up. I feel like if this gets any worse I'm going to pass out. The intense pain lasts about five minutes and then diminishes to about a 7 for another five minutes. Then down to a 4 for five minutes. After about 20 minutes I'm completely back to normal. I'm going to contact doctor about this. The pain really is a 10. It's terrible. I can't handle this every three hours.",

      "Content": "I had my catheter removed today. The dye test showed no leaking. I have some issues I wanted to ask about. 1) After urinating, my bladder and urethra got very painful for about 20 minutes. I don't know if this is normal or not. This may be due to bladder spasms but not sure. I never took the spasm meds but I still have the full bottle. Should I take some? 2) The tip where the catheter entered the urethra stings like the dickens when the urine hits it. In a way this may be good because I get instant feedback when I'm leaking. I hope this clears up soon. 3) I found that I am compensating for the fact that I am expecting to leak. As as result, I am clenching my PC muscle all the time expecting to hold back a leak. My PC muscle is fatiguing because of this. This is causing discomfort. Should I just chill out and relax it and let the leaks happen? I will create my profile line later this week when I get to feeling better.",
