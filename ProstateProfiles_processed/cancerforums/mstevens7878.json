      "Content": "I've had 2 prostatectomies, the last about a year ago. I am 64, and after the second one really had to rely on ED drugs completely. I did experience negative side effects at first (flushed face, back/leg soreness, headaches, dry mouth, stuffy nose) but most of the time even a half dose would seem as effective and really cut down on the side effects. I'm not making alot of money right now, so I have been ordering generic versions from this site http://goo.gl/oNqHkh, my insurance that covers everything else will not cover ED meds at all (I am prescribed to both Cialis & Viagra) and this pharmacy ships to me, and is way cheaper. The drugs are in the same amounts and seem to work exactly the same. Has anyone here had any experience with the \"generic\" versions that are available?",
