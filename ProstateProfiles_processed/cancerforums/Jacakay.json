      "Content": "My husband just turned 58 a week ago! Happy birthday.. Surprise! You have prostate cancer! His blood pressure has always been on the lower side of normal range. When he laid down, it dropped. Not to sure to what, but I think first number was in the low 90 range. From experience, urologist says its not uncommon for pressure to drop about 20 points from the biopsy itself.. He just didn't want to risk anything ba happening to husband. He will not continue with out medical clearance. Fortunately we see regular doctor in Monday for clearance. I should mention that hubby takes lots of meds for his other issues.. I wouldn't be surprised of one or more is contributing to low blood pressure. He restarted lithium, (because of suicidal thoughts) and he's been dizzy since starting it. Of course, he never said anything to me about being dizzy, so I had no clue. one more thing.. In January I went with him to psych dr. Insisted he get him off some of the meds he was on. It was making him sedated and foggy, and probably contributing to thr dementia issues. Since then... He has lost almost 40 pounds. Size 32 pants are too big for him! I thought it was medication related, but now, I wonder I the sudden weight loss was not the cancer.",

But are scheduled for Friday at 9 am! As for the depression... He's been on every medication you can think of, and then some. Six years ago he had ECT treatments to help. It didn't. It hasn't gotten better in 8-9 years.. I don't think it's gonna get better now that he has PCa. But again, I am curious how you relied the pressure.. He had a small amount of leakage recently.. Not good..",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply. I should mention that as of now, there is no pain associated with the cancer. My question about the metastasis was how does the amount of suspected metastasis compare relatively to others. Is the amount of suspected metastasis a lot, or are we at the beginning, mid phases of it. You also seem to think that his depression is the result of cancer. It is not. He has battled major depression for years. Debilitating depression. As I mentioned, he was suicidal before he received the news that he might have cancer or it had spread. My point is, I don't think his outlook on life will improve with this diagnosis. His days consists of sleeping very late, smoking outside during the day, and watching tv until past midnight. THI IS NOT GOOD, and I have been unable to get him to change his lifestyle. He refuses to go to most family outings, so he stays indoors, save dr appointments an visits to his mother. I will talk to dr about biopsy. He was concerned that his pressure would get so low he would need to call an ambulance. He need to get clearance from general doctor before he will continue. I am sorry you are in a lot of pain. Tha k you for sharing your experience with me. It gives me information on what is to come. I do not wish that on anyone. Interestingly, he went to ER in December for rib pain. Symptoms similar to pulmonary embolism. They rules that out and sent him home. Now I wonder if it was related. His \"pain\" do far is akin to non-specific back aches.. Three my back out kinda pain. Never bad. I thought he'd thrown his back out.. If only I knew.",

      "Content": "About 2 months ago, husband went to see primary doctor due to frequent urination, etc. PSA came back at 44 and he saw a urologist the next day. Repeat PSA was 56. I'm guessing lab variations, as I cannot think it would increase 12 points in 3 days. Dr. started antibiotics, repeat PSA, still 56. Sent on for bone scan and it is \"suggestive\" of metastasis on L3-L4, as well as ribs 9-11 on left. Scan showed bright spots on ribs 6, both sides. Radiologist indicated possible trauma, urologist thinks cancer. Free PSA is 8%. Biopsy scheduled for this past Friday,but his blood preassure was to low and doctor was concerned about continuing. He needs pre-op clearance before continuing. Right now everything is pointing to prostate cancer, but no proof, via biopsy.. So we're looking at about 2 months from original concern, to possible treatment. Urologist says in the grand scheme of things 2 months won't matter. He doesn't seem to concerned, but I think it's just that he has \"great\" bedside manner. I absolutely love him! A little more history on husband. Bi-polar and has not done well with treatments. Continual state of depression. Suicidal 3 weeks ago, (before we second visit with urologist suspecting cancer) He was diagnosis with frontal temporal dementia (FTD) in November, but second and third opinion disagreed. Seems like its bi-polar related dementia. Pulimanary embolism 5 years ago, due to bi-polar meds. Bottom like is this. He is not a happy camper, chipper Kipper. He's gloom, down depressed. He has two moods.. Sad and sadder. And it's been like this for years. I've continued to take care of him and all the household responsibilities. I know it's only about to get worse. Spinal fusion years ago from L-3 down.. Everything under L-3 to tailbone. I know your mental attitude can affect treatment.. And having cancer itself, increases your chances of depression. So how will having really bad depression affect life expectancy. Should I be concerned in the delay in getting a real diagnosis, as he cannot begin treatment until biopsy is done. I know cancer in bones is bad. But how \"bad\" is it, given that there are 2 vertebrae, an 3, possibly 5 ribs infected. There are over 200 bones in the human body.. Is 7 bones really a lot? On a metastasis scale, what are we looking at? I will also mention he has expressed that when he urinates, he has a sensation to deficate at the same time. Had not happened, but just a new weird feeling of peeing and pooping at the same time. Dr. thought it might be something to do with spinal compressing the nerves that control elimination.",

But are scheduled for Friday at 9 am! As for the depression... He's been on every medication you can think of, and then some. Six years ago he had ECT treatments to help. It didn't. It hasn't gotten better in 8-9 years.. I don't think it's gonna get better now that he has PCa. But again, I am curious how you relied the pressure.. He had a small amount of leakage recently.. Not good..",

We already STRONGLY suspect hubby has cancer, being that PSA was 56, even after antibiotics, bone scan showed metastasis on L3-4 and ribs, and free PSA 8%. Biopsy finally done last Friday, and we go in tomorrow for the dreaded results. Needless to say, it's been a long, long week. Besides getting a copy of the pathology report, WHAT QUETIONS SHOULD WE HAVE FOR UROLOGIST? He has already mentioned the name of the oncologist as a Dr. Reddy in Allen, TX..

      "Content": "So, as suspected, he does have cancer. I guess having all these signs helped minimize the blow. We knew what we were going in for. I swear... It was like walking the green mile. Felt like we were going into the executioner's chamber.. Anyway.. Results are as follows.. 12 cores tested 10 positive 1 inconclusive (really... You couldn't tell?? That's your only job!) Total Gleason score 7 (3+4) 2 cores came back 4+3 2 cores came back 3+3 6 cores came back 3+3 Going to radiology oncologist next week. I thought the Gleason score would be the highest number.. Most cores are 3+4, but with 2 being 4+3, wouldn't that be the official score? I've for it in my head that most gleasone scores are upgraded anyway, so I'm thinking it's really an 8 :\\ But that's just me. Also, I guess I fully expected a larger number, given the high PSA and bone mets. Is it strange that no tumors can be felt on the prostate and it's not very enlarged?? Also, we know there is cancer on the bones.. How likely is it that it's spread to some of the soft tissue, and how will that affect treatment?? This has been a stressful last couple of months, but I keep putting one foot in front of the other. He, understandably, is having a harder time with his depression. He doesn't want to get out of bed, and will not participate in family activities. He's not eating well, but that's not much different than before. He generally eats only one meal a day, but will drink 2-3 24 oz beers daily. He will not stop drinking. I don't think he can, or wants to. Just in November we were told he had a brain disease that would kill him in 5-8 years.. Then in April we are told he's ok. Got over that hurdle.. And now this. I feel so bad for him. If he could get out of this funk, I know he'd have a fighting chance. As he stands now, I'm afraid he won't be here next year! Thanks for letting me vent..",

      "Content": "This is a 2 part question.. So for the men who have had incontinence issues, my husband is almost 3 months post surgery (10/2/13). He is still going thru 6-9 pads a day and briefs. I am considering ordering him a penis clamp. Some have great reviews, but they all look like a midevil torture device. Pads and underwear is not working.. Have any of you tried them? Is there a preference? Or a better alternative? I also saw a catheter bag with a condom type thing you put on the penis and a bag that attached to the leg just like after surgery, but the one I saw had awful reviews. And for the wives (and I know there are a few here): I am having a really hard time coping with the urine. He leaks from his pads constently. He leaks on our bed. We have washable mattress pads (a lot) but he just leaks off them. He puts them in the bathroom to dry, and them the bathroom smells, and the bedroom smells. His robe smells. I should mention that he has issues unrelated to the prostate cancer (like depression and possible dementia) so hygiene is minimal at best. I rarely wear shoes at home and I can't tell you how many times I have stepped in pee because he leaked on the way to the bathroom and didn't clean it. He has no problem with walking out of the bathroom with a urine soaked pad while we have company to throw them away. I was mortified. After I complained of the smell in the kitchen, He confessed to peeing in the trash can because he wouldn't make it to te bathroom. Who does that? I keep telling him that his output is related to his input, but he still has several cups of coffee and 2 large (32 oz) beers a day, plus water. Unfortunately, he will not stop drinking. Is there even one person who can relate. I feel that this situation is unique given his mental issues and the fact that we have younger children at home, and now prostate cancer. We're barely 6 months into this diagnosis and I don't think I can handle 10 years of this! ( his cancer has spread to lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, and possible bladder neck. Doctor says a \"good\" prognosis a is 10 years; starting hormone shots in January, then radiation after)",

      "Content": "I apologize for the errors I made! I did mean to say his Gleason was (3+4) 7. His first PSA was 44, followed by 56,56, and 44 again. His biopsy showed 10 positive cores, 1 negative and 1 inconclusive. 2 of those cores were Gleason 8. Free PSA was 8%. He is 58. He is experiencing some back pain but more like a back ache. And most recently, he had an incident of involuntary bowel movement, followed by almost daily leakage. The dr. at md Anderson did not think it was related to the prostate cancer. I will mention he has not undergone any treatment, except taking rapiflo for urinary urgency, which has helped. Not sure what his prostate size is.. I just know its not very big. I think they said 60, but I don't remember the unit of measurement they used.. He also had a spinal fusion 20+years ago, which the doctor at MDA thinks may be causing bowel issues. Drs here think its related to spine metastasis. I realize the importance of getting the best treatment. Just trying to figure out the logistics. Twin 10 year olds in school, and a baby under 1. He has not been well for a long time, and I have taken care of him for the last 7 years. I'm trying to balance caring for him and the kids as well as manage expenses. We live soley on his disability income. Oh, to win the lottery! The idea of a third opinion.. I hadn't thought of that and will discuss this with him!",

      "Content": "I apologize for the errors I made! I did mean to say his Gleason was (3+4) 7. His first PSA was 44, followed by 56,56, and 44 again. His biopsy showed 10 positive cores, 1 negative and 1 inconclusive. 2 of those cores were Gleason 8. Free PSA was 8%. He is 58. He is experiencing some back pain but more like a back ache. And most recently, he had an incident of involuntary bowel movement, followed by almost daily leakage. The dr. at md Anderson did not think it was related to the prostate cancer. I will mention he has not undergone any treatment, except taking rapiflo for urinary urgency, which has helped. Not sure what his prostate size is.. I just know its not very big. I think they said 60, but I don't remember the unit of measurement they used.. He also had a spinal fusion 20+years ago, which the doctor at MDA thinks may be causing bowel issues. Drs here think its related to spine metastasis. I realize the importance of getting the best treatment. Just trying to figure out the logistics. Twin 10 year olds in school, and a baby under 1. He has not been well for a long time, and I have taken care of him for the last 7 years. I'm trying to balance caring for him and the kids as well as manage expenses. We live soley on his disability income. Oh, to win the lottery! The idea of a third opinion.. I hadn't thought of that and will discuss this with him!",

      "Content": "Two months ago we has a bone scan and were told there was spinal metastasis and possible rib lesions as well. Follow up X-rays and ct were inconclusive, but it was assumed by our local treatment team that've had metastatic prostate cancer. PSA consistently over 40.. Different labs have come up with a PSA as high as 56. Both places came back with a Gleason (3+7) Went for a second opinion at MD Anderson and just got a call that their radiologist looked at all the scans and saw no metastasis. For 2 months we have believed that cancer had spread to the spine, and now they are saying no.. That's awesome news. I do wonder why we were til it was in spine. Also, has anyone else has a PSA in the 40-50 range where there was no metastasis? Now that his cancer does not seem as serious, should we consider local treatment. MD Anderson is nice, but it's a 4 1/2 hour drive.. With a baby. Not to mention the wait there is awful. They were 4 1/2 hours late on our first appointment.. Each trip will cost us 120 dollars minimum.. Not to mention, I'm the only one who's driving, as husband has poor vision. Thoughts?",
