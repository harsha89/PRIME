That's a procedure where they put you under full anaesthetic and take 30 or more samples from your prostate. It's not too bad a procedure. That biopsy did find two positive cores with very small amounts of Gleason 6 cancer, so at least now we know what we're dealing with.",

I'm on AS, and my current doctor believes in a annual biopsy no matter what, and for that reason I am switching doctors. I got a second opinion from a very qualified doc and he said, in my case, biopsies should be every 2-4 years, depending upon other factors. There is no \"official\" position on how often to do biopsies under an AS protocol, so I'd recommend getting a few opinions from different doctors on what they would do in your case, and going with the one who you click with.",

      "Content": "I have several of those biopsies. Seems like everyone reacts a bit differently. My doc doesn't sedate me, but he does inject lidocaine to numb the place where the samples are taken. For me the worst part is simply the presence of a probe where I don't particularly want a probe. To me it's quite uncomfortable and it stays there for the 15 or 20 minutes the procedure lasts. Note I didn't say painful; just quite uncomfortable. When the needle actually takes the samples you hear the machine snap, but it's not particularly painful. It's icky hearing the snap and waiting for it to happen, but as I said, it's not actually painful. About an hour after the procedure is over, when the lidocaine wears off, I feel considerable pain for a couple of hours. Then, by the evening, I'm good to go do anything I want. I'd recommend having whatever painkiller they allow with you at the procedure so you can take it, after it's over, as soon as you begin to feel some pain. Hope this helps.",

I realize that a rising PSA is a sign to check in again for a patient on AS, but, the question is, is there any reason to do a biopsy if the MRI is negative.

      "Content": "I'm on AS because several biopsies have either been negative or shown a very small amount of G6 cancer. Here's my question: I just had an MRI which does not show any suspicious spots. Is there any reason to do a biopsy in this case? My PSA continues to rise and may be as high as 11 (it is more likely around 9). I realize that a rising PSA is a sign to check in again for a patient on AS, but, the question is, is there any reason to do a biopsy if the MRI is negative. I'm at a major academic medical center and my doc has pretty good confidence in the radiologists. Thanks,",

      "Content": "Folks, thanks for the responses, but perhaps my brief question didn't adequately convey my situation (and the fact I've been too lazy to put together one of the signature lines. Just so you won't worry about me: 1. I have already been diagnosed with prostate cancer; that's why I'm on AS. 2. I'm in a protocol with a doctor at Northwestern here in Chicago, and get second opinions from a doctor at the University of Chicago. So I'm under very good care. 3. I've had multiple biopsies including a saturation biopsy and several of the genetic tests. 4. I've had every test possible, so I'm not using an 8-ball! So I'm covered. To expand a bit, my question really arises from this. My doc is a very cautious fellow and wants me to have annual biopsies. Indeed. the last two were only 10 months apart because of a rising PSA. However, Dr. Eggener at the University of Chicago thinks my doc is WAY over testing me; that I only need a biopsy every 2-3 years years. So I'm caught not knowing what to do. Two docs recommending different AS protocols. In this context, my question arises, and I know there is no easy answer. If your MRI is negative, of course I know I have cancer, but is there a possibility that a new Gleason 7 or greater cancer has developed, or my Gleason 6 cancer has increased in volume (two triggers for treatment) when the MRI is negative? That's why I posed the question of whether yet another biopsy is useful if the MRI is negative. Final note: My doc hasn't made a recommendation yet. I pose questions here, however, so I can have a more educated conversation with my doc!",
