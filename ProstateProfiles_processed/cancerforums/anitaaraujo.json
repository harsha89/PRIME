    "Content": "HI Everyone, I am new to the group...not really a group I want to be a part of considering the circumstances...but glad it exists for opinions, resources and support.. I would like to start by saying I'm sorry that you all are in this group also, and hope and wish health and happiness to everyone. I joined this group in hopes that I could get some insight and opinions regarding my Dad's somewhat recent diagnosis of stage 4 prostate cancer. Ironically, last November my dad was diagnosed at 64 with Stage 4 Prostate Cancer, his PSA levels were almost 6,000. The doctors couldnt believe the cancer was so advanced considering he was having very little pain and they hadn't ever checked his PSA levels until this test. After his diagnosis he started seeing an oncologist in Hamilton, and also a Naturopath here in Kitchener. The oncologist told our family that he didn't want to proceed with Chemo at this time, it was advanced too much for Radiation, but that they could start him on hormone therapy (which is currently fermagon). They had said hopefully this will work for 2-3 years, eventually, it stops, but hopefully it would work for some time. At the naturopath he started taking several types of vitamins and pills and also started the Vitamin C IV weekly. He felt stronger and his PSA levels went down as low as 16, at his apt a month ago, his levels had started to rise again being 67, and they had said they will check again at his apt this month to see if they have continued and discuss further treatment options. His PSA has gone up to 108. Therefore stating, the hormone therapy just isn't doing what it should anymore. The Oncologist has recommended Chemo (we asked if there were any other options) and he said there is a pill that he can take (not sure exactly what they mean) but it's $4000 a month, however, we could apply to health canada for funding. again, asking anything else, the doctor said and possibly a different hormone therapy. The Naturopath said that he wouldn't recommend chemo; but that he could start a different IV 3x a week which would be approx $600 a month. Our family is very confused as to what we should do; and with all these different options what would be the best choice. We have tried some research regarding different hormone therapy, Lupron, being one. Does anyone have any experience with these hormone therapy's and have gone through a similar situation, either yourself or a family member? We aren't extremely concerned regarding $$, but want to be sure we are putting the $$ in the right treatment to help prolong his life. Please Help..any info helps.",
