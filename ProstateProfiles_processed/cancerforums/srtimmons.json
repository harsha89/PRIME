      "Content": "Had my 6-week post surgery appointment yesterday. My doctor, Dr. Slawin of Houston, uses the ultra-sensitive PSA test. He looks for anything under 0.03 as good whereas the other threshhold in use today by Waslh, et al is 0.1. I asked him about the controversy and he has done significant research about PSA testing and feels the ultra-sensitive test gives a better chance to detect PCa recurrence sooner and then to treat it effective with salvage methods. As a layperson, beats me as to which is best. I just happen to be in the ultra-sensitve camps right now. Intuitively, since PSA should be 0.0 with no prostate cells, any level of PSA, if accurate, would mean cells are still out there making PSA and should be dealt with.
