      "Content": "Eligard and Lupron are the same drug and they induce chemical castration and all the wonderful things that implies...The longer you are on it, the more profound the reaction is....One year is not too bad, most men recover quickly from that. Two years treatment, the recovery is slower and not as certain..After 3 years, there is little chance of the comeback, the effect becomes pretty permanent. Much depends on your age..Younger men recover better than older men..Hot flashes day and night. They slowly taper off..Loss of sexual desire and ability..You become impotent but you don't care..Loss of most of your body hair. Slow breast development. Testicles shrink to half their former size..Slow loss of muscle mass replaced with fat (if you are not very careful). But. controlling the cancer now (it does that very nicely) will give your body a chance to fully heal from the surgery before you begin the Radiation Treatment..The radiation will stop the healing process right where it is... In the past, it was thought that 40 fractions was the correct dose rate for radiation. But with todays expanded knowledge and vastly improved equipment, many RO's are finding that a shorter treatment of around 25 fractions work just as well if not better with no increase in toxicity..A side benefit to this is that it's much cheaper and you are done quicker. I would talk to your RO about it. Best of luck to you...",

That stuff can be hard to find once you leave the hospital...If your appetite is zero, some \"liquid Diet\" stuff like \"Ensure\" and Canada Dry Ginger Ale will usually go down and stay down until you can eat again...Best of luck to you !",

It is usually combined with Lupron and the two drugs work in concert..Surgeons however prefer that heavy HT not be used because it makes the prostate gland \"sticky\" and difficult to work with...I'm just guessing, but perhaps they put you on Casodex as a holding action to limit your cancer growth while not creating more problems for the surgeon..Read Walsh's book..... I too have underwent all three treatments, surgery, radiation and (currently) HT..and my doctors all agreed (after the surgery alone had failed) that it was NOT a waste of time and by removing all the cancer they could by surgery, the radiation and HT had much less cancer to deal with and my life would be prolonged as a result.. On your next blood draw, you might ask that your testosterone level be checked also..With hormone therapy, you need to keep an eye on both sides of the coin....",

Also 1000mg/day calcium and Vit-D to combat bone loss that can accompany HT.. Should you also undergo surgery as your primary treatment you should know that radiation treatment will stop the recovery process from the surgery..So you want to be fully continent or as continent as possible before you start the radiation..If you are lucky, your first PSA test at 5 weeks after surgery will be zero and that will give you some breathing room to fully recover from the surgery before they start the radiation..I was lucky in that I was dry from day one, but most guys go through a period of incontinence after surgery..",

In the States you would be offered surgery (to remove the prostate gland) or maybe radiation to kill the cancer in the gland..Hormone therapy (Zoladex and Casodex) would only be used if the surgery or radiation did not cure it...Hormone therapy is not curative..It will control your cancer for a period of time then the cancer will progress.. Gleason 6 is not aggressive cancer and it seldom if ever metastasizes outside the prostate gland. The trouble is you can never be SURE there is no higher grade cancer lurking that the biopsy missed....The only way to know for sure is to remove the gland and do a complete pathology examination on it....",

      "Content": "After 18 months on HT and an undetectable PSA, my R.O. relented and allowed me to stop the HT. But 6 months later my PSA was no longer undetectable..I went back on Eligard (same as Lupron) but PSA did not return to zero..Medical Oncologist added Casodex (50mg/day) and in October I'll have another check-up and see where I stand..On my own, I'm also doing pomegranate, IP-6, Turmeric as diet supplements. Also 1000mg/day calcium and Vit-D to combat bone loss that can accompany HT.. Should you also undergo surgery as your primary treatment you should know that radiation treatment will stop the recovery process from the surgery..So you want to be fully continent or as continent as possible before you start the radiation..If you are lucky, your first PSA test at 5 weeks after surgery will be zero and that will give you some breathing room to fully recover from the surgery before they start the radiation..I was lucky in that I was dry from day one, but most guys go through a period of incontinence after surgery..",

      "Content": "With your G-6 and low PSA, either treatment gives you a 95% chance for a full cure....So it becomes a choice of side-effect risk.... Surgery allows for a detailed pathology report of your cancer, which can differ from the limited biopsy report..And, should it fail, you get a second chance for a cure with salvage radiation...But you face a higher risk of impotence and incontinence.. With radiation, the side-effect risk is lower, but there is no second chance should it fail to cure you..Some radiation oncologists combine both seeds and beam radiation to achieve a better success than even surgery provides while still maintaining lower side-effects... You can take your time with this, do your research, investigate the treatment centers that specialize in performing these treatments and have perfected them..At 53, your insurance company (if you have insurance) will have a say in what treatments they are willing to pay for.. You should ask that the treatment provider get pre-approval to avoid any unpleasant surprises.. Best of luck to you and welcome to The Club......",

It is usually combined with Lupron and the two drugs work in concert..Surgeons however prefer that heavy HT not be used because it makes the prostate gland \"sticky\" and difficult to work with...I'm just guessing, but perhaps they put you on Casodex as a holding action to limit your cancer growth while not creating more problems for the surgeon..Read Walsh's book..... I too have underwent all three treatments, surgery, radiation and (currently) HT..and my doctors all agreed (after the surgery alone had failed) that it was NOT a waste of time and by removing all the cancer they could by surgery, the radiation and HT had much less cancer to deal with and my life would be prolonged as a result.. On your next blood draw, you might ask that your testosterone level be checked also..With hormone therapy, you need to keep an eye on both sides of the coin....",

Removing testosterone from PC victims bodies is a proven, effective treatment..For a period of time at least, the cancer can be controlled by using \"hormone therapy\", adding years to patients lives...To move in the opposite direction, intentionally increasing the \"T\" level in men diagnosed with PC, that would be classified as malpractice...But in the 85% of men who do not have PC or BPH, then boosting \"T\" levels is harmless at least from the prostates standpoint...

In the States you would be offered surgery (to remove the prostate gland) or maybe radiation to kill the cancer in the gland..Hormone therapy (Zoladex and Casodex) would only be used if the surgery or radiation did not cure it...Hormone therapy is not curative..It will control your cancer for a period of time then the cancer will progress.. Gleason 6 is not aggressive cancer and it seldom if ever metastasizes outside the prostate gland. The trouble is you can never be SURE there is no higher grade cancer lurking that the biopsy missed....The only way to know for sure is to remove the gland and do a complete pathology examination on it....",

      "Content": "After 18 months on HT and an undetectable PSA, my R.O. relented and allowed me to stop the HT. But 6 months later my PSA was no longer undetectable..I went back on Eligard (same as Lupron) but PSA did not return to zero..Medical Oncologist added Casodex (50mg/day) and in October I'll have another check-up and see where I stand..On my own, I'm also doing pomegranate, IP-6, Turmeric as diet supplements. Also 1000mg/day calcium and Vit-D to combat bone loss that can accompany HT.. Should you also undergo surgery as your primary treatment you should know that radiation treatment will stop the recovery process from the surgery..So you want to be fully continent or as continent as possible before you start the radiation..If you are lucky, your first PSA test at 5 weeks after surgery will be zero and that will give you some breathing room to fully recover from the surgery before they start the radiation..I was lucky in that I was dry from day one, but most guys go through a period of incontinence after surgery..",

Two years treatment, the recovery is slower and not as certain..After 3 years, there is little chance of the comeback, the effect becomes pretty permanent. Much depends on your age..Younger men recover better than older men..Hot flashes day and night. They slowly taper off..Loss of sexual desire and ability..You become impotent but you don't care..Loss of most of your body hair. Slow breast development. Testicles shrink to half their former size..Slow loss of muscle mass replaced with fat (if you are not very careful). But. controlling the cancer now (it does that very nicely) will give your body a chance to fully heal from the surgery before you begin the Radiation Treatment..The radiation will stop the healing process right where it is... In the past, it was thought that 40 fractions was the correct dose rate for radiation. But with todays expanded knowledge and vastly improved equipment, many RO's are finding that a shorter treatment of around 25 fractions work just as well if not better with no increase in toxicity..A side benefit to this is that it's much cheaper and you are done quicker. I would talk to your RO about it. Best of luck to you...",

      "Content": "Casodex is an older HT drug and is, today, seldom used by itself. It is usually combined with Lupron and the two drugs work in concert..Surgeons however prefer that heavy HT not be used because it makes the prostate gland \"sticky\" and difficult to work with...I'm just guessing, but perhaps they put you on Casodex as a holding action to limit your cancer growth while not creating more problems for the surgeon..Read Walsh's book..... I too have underwent all three treatments, surgery, radiation and (currently) HT..and my doctors all agreed (after the surgery alone had failed) that it was NOT a waste of time and by removing all the cancer they could by surgery, the radiation and HT had much less cancer to deal with and my life would be prolonged as a result.. On your next blood draw, you might ask that your testosterone level be checked also..With hormone therapy, you need to keep an eye on both sides of the coin....",

      "Content": "After 18 months on HT and an undetectable PSA, my R.O. relented and allowed me to stop the HT. But 6 months later my PSA was no longer undetectable..I went back on Eligard (same as Lupron) but PSA did not return to zero..Medical Oncologist added Casodex (50mg/day) and in October I'll have another check-up and see where I stand..On my own, I'm also doing pomegranate, IP-6, Turmeric as diet supplements. Also 1000mg/day calcium and Vit-D to combat bone loss that can accompany HT.. Should you also undergo surgery as your primary treatment you should know that radiation treatment will stop the recovery process from the surgery..So you want to be fully continent or as continent as possible before you start the radiation..If you are lucky, your first PSA test at 5 weeks after surgery will be zero and that will give you some breathing room to fully recover from the surgery before they start the radiation..I was lucky in that I was dry from day one, but most guys go through a period of incontinence after surgery..",

It is usually combined with Lupron and the two drugs work in concert..Surgeons however prefer that heavy HT not be used because it makes the prostate gland \"sticky\" and difficult to work with...I'm just guessing, but perhaps they put you on Casodex as a holding action to limit your cancer growth while not creating more problems for the surgeon..Read Walsh's book..... I too have underwent all three treatments, surgery, radiation and (currently) HT..and my doctors all agreed (after the surgery alone had failed) that it was NOT a waste of time and by removing all the cancer they could by surgery, the radiation and HT had much less cancer to deal with and my life would be prolonged as a result.. On your next blood draw, you might ask that your testosterone level be checked also..With hormone therapy, you need to keep an eye on both sides of the coin....",

Quality of life and long-term survival are sometimes at odds with each other....Only you and your husband can chart your journey..It might be worth traveling to a major cancer treatment center and get a second opinion on a course of treatment that offers the best possible outcome..You only get one chance at this...Best of luck to you both..",

Surgery allows for a detailed pathology report of your cancer, which can differ from the limited biopsy report..And, should it fail, you get a second chance for a cure with salvage radiation...But you face a higher risk of impotence and incontinence.. With radiation, the side-effect risk is lower, but there is no second chance should it fail to cure you..Some radiation oncologists combine both seeds and beam radiation to achieve a better success than even surgery provides while still maintaining lower side-effects... You can take your time with this, do your research, investigate the treatment centers that specialize in performing these treatments and have perfected them..At 53, your insurance company (if you have insurance) will have a say in what treatments they are willing to pay for.. You should ask that the treatment provider get pre-approval to avoid any unpleasant surprises.. Best of luck to you and welcome to The Club......",

He says if you let your cancer progress unchecked even for a short period, it can be very difficult to get it under control again..Looks like you have modified your diet and are taking a few supplements..You might check out one called Pomi-T. it can't hurt.. At age 48, I would be looking at the most aggressive treatment available including any clinical trials that offer the latest drugs and treatment techniques...It might be worth traveling to one of the big cancer research and treatment centers where the latest scans and diagnostic tools are available.. Best of luck to you.. The reason surgery or radiation was not offered to you is because the scans showed the cancer has metastasized, spread beyond the primary tumor. But if your scans are now clean, no detectable spread, then IGRT, beam radiation, might be worthwhile and available to you...Talk to a Radiation Oncologist about it..",

My surgeon did no more than 3 a week...So maybe in the real world, there are 1000 surgeons doing these operations... So when a surgeon begins his career doing robotic surgeries, some poor bugger has to be #1, # 2 and number 3...and number 100...These poor guys are lucky just to come out of the operating room alive..Expecting to be cured of their cancers, expecting to remain continent and potent, that would be like depending on miracles..I guess we should just be happy we live in a place where articles like this get published and patients can do a little research before they let the smiling anesthesiologist stick that needle in their arm...",

So waiting until October to start that is not unreasonable..if your PSA continues to rise, they can clamp it and prepare you for radiation treatment by starting adjunct ADT now..At some point you need to consult with a Radiation Oncologist and get his thoughts....",

Any DRE performed by a \"she\" internist has little value..If the URO feels a biopsy is called for, DO IT ! If you are scared to death about what a biopsy might find, you will REALLY be scared when your PSA is over 30 and the URO tells you a biopsy is no longer necessary and he refers you to a Medical Oncologist...You can go to any number of walk-in labs and get a PSA test without a prescription. You will have the results in a few hours..",

Then maybe read Dr. Chodaks book, shorter and to the point, it goes over the treatment options with a fine tooth comb. \"Winning the battle Against Prostate Cancer\" something like that..Also, most Urologists are also surgeons, Dr. Walsh is one of the best, so these specialists naturally favor surgery..It was once the Gold Standard for treating prostate cancer. But that is no longer true, radiation in its many forms has made great advances over the past 10 or 15 years to where now it equals or exceeds surgery in effectiveness..Talk to a Medical Oncologist, they have seen it all and they get to treat those for whom surgery and radiation have failed. They can offer worthwhile insights you won't get from Urologists, surgeons, Radiation Oncologists.. best of luck to you !",

      "Content": "Three years is a long time for adjunct hormone treatment...You are correct in that you won't know if the SRT worked until you stop taking the hormone drugs..The ultra-sensitive PSA test you are using tends to bounce around so you can view 0.02-0.05 as undetectable. The standard test is close enough at this point and >0.1 is also viewed as undetectable without all the drama..After 18 months on HT and undetectable PSA, I persuaded my R.O. to take me off the shots a little early..I stayed undetectable for 6 months but then a 0.3 PSA....I'm back on HT for the duration....The problem with 3 years on the HT drugs, after that long, the effect of the drugs becomes more or less permanent. Your testicles atrophy and that's that....Also, you only get so much effectiveness out of HT..After a while you become \"Hormone Refractory\", your cancer progresses.. There is plenty of debate about how long \"adjunct HT\" needs to be administered to get the added benefit from the RT / HT package...The quality of life problems caused by 3 years of HT may be too high a price to pay for the benefit achieved...Many R.O.'s feel 18 months to 2 years works almost as good as 3 years. Some only use 1 year to limit quality of life problems..",

Be sure you were reading the 3rd edition of his book..There is debate as to when to start HT after curative measures have failed..Every case is different..Every case responds differently to treatment. Some men get a nice, long remission on HT while in others the disease progresses rapidly regardless of treatment..Some men can go on prolonged HT \"vacations\" and their PSA behaves or advances slowly..In others, as soon as testosterone levels begin to climb, the PSA levels increase rapidly and can be very hard to get back under control.... Dr Walsh is a master surgeon and Urologist. He also knows much about Oncology as it relates to prostate cancer..But he is NOT a Medical Oncologist and he seldom treats PC patients once metastasis is detected..The exact methods and timetables used in the palliative treatment of terminal cancer patients is not his area of expertise. But you can be sure whatever appears in his book has the full approval of the Oncology department at Johns-Hopkins..His book is considered \"The Bible\" for good reason... http://urology.jhu.edu/patrickwalsh/",

      "Content": "Hormone therapy is used in one of two ways..First as an adjunct to some other form of primary treatment be it surgery or radiation. Studies have shown it can increase the effectiveness of SRT, salvage radiation treatment, and it can also be used to augment any radiation treatment. Radiation Oncologists love it because it makes them look good both in the short term and hopefully in the long term.. In the past, HT was used as a primary treatment for late-stage PC discovered before the age of the PSA test. Physical castration was the method employed. This never CURED anyone of Prostate Cancer, but it gave them several years of survival improvement. Today, it still offers no cure, it's a palliative treatment, and drugs are used instead of castration. Since it's effective and relatively inexpensive, it's still used before the newer, far more expensive therapies that are now available..When the HT stops working and the patients PSA continues to rise, it's referred to as becoming \"hormone refractory\".. The downside of HT are the side-effects...They begin with hot flashes which can be severe, many men feel fatigued and listless, some suffer emotional upsets, all sex drive and ability quickly evaporates, breast development begins, body hair disappears, ones personality becomes a lot more \"mellow\"... Not everyone suffers all these things at the same time, but as the duration of treatment grows longer, the side-effects become more prominent..The unspoken truth is that few men have to endure HT for prolonged periods of time....Another unspoken truth, the longer you are on HT, the longer it takes to recover from it and after 3 years or so, the effect of the drugs becomes permanent in most men... Men without health insurance might wish to consider physical castration as the long-term cost of the drugs used can be quite high. Castration is the least expensive form of HT and it's thought to be the most effective as it lowers testosterone levels to almost nothing...",

Both work equally well, so comes down to a choice of side-effect risk..In my opinion, the most effective radiation treatment is Brachy (seeds) plus IGRT used in combination. You can add a year of hormone therapy to that mix, but that increases the side-effects considerably... Regardless of what you do, it's worth the effort to find the best surgeon or radiation oncologist available to you to perform these treatments...But in the end, YOU will have to make the choice of what treatment is best for YOU.",

If you choose surgery (you have other choices) know that the skill of the surgeon is all-important..The BEST surgeons get considerably better results than the not so good ones...So do your homework when choosing your surgeon..There are two types of surgery, open or robotic. They both work equally well, again, success depends on the skill of the surgeon...Best of luck to both you and your Dad...",

Recent studies have shown it's more effective if used first instead of last...It has also been discovered that bringing Zytiga (abiraterone) in sooner also works better... Other things to consider, get pre-approval from your insurance company before starting Zytiga, it's very expensive.. At some point Dad should have some scans (MRI, bone scan) to check if the cancer has spread and if so, how badly...His treatment will be based on the results of these scans... How long the Zytiga will be effective varies with every patient..2 to 5 years is a pretty good ball-park estimate.. There is another drug, Xtandi that can be tried if and when the Zytiga fails..",

Most aspects of cancer treatment are very profitable for the people delivering the treatment...The drugs used are usually expensive in the extreme....Surgery can easily top $70,000. Radiation treatment, the 40 fraction IMRT / IGRT variety can go $150,000..So it's to be expected that the people (doctors) who provide these treatments all claim that the treatment they are providing is best....The FDA tries to keep a lid on the situation but since all these treatments and drugs have demonstrated that they work and in the case of surgery and radiation they seem to work equally well..So it is left to the patient to separate the wheat from the chaff and choose a treatment protocol that suits their needs best..None of the treatments are without risks, many present major quality of life issues....I have found consulting with my family doctor can be helpful..He has no financial interest in your cancer treatment and he has seen it all when it comes to both positive and negative results of cancer treatment...",

      "Content": "Yes, the next step in your treatment is called hormone therapy..Since there are major quality of life issues associated with this treatment, your doctors may wish to wait as long as possible before starting it..They don't inject you with hormones..They inject you with Lupron or a similar drug which stops the production of testosterone in your body. Most forms of PC require testosterone to grow and spread..Unfortunately, this treatment does not work forever..The length of time it's effective is different in every case so it's very hard to predict but for the majority of cases, the time period is 2 to 5 years. When you get your second opinions, one of the specialists you talk to should be a medical oncologist who is up to date on treating prostate patients..This is no longer a Urology issue.....Best of luck to you !",

There will be side-effects from that... Mortality prognosis is difficult to predict until metastasis to the bones is confirmed..Then that 5 year average is correct. At tens years, 90% have died..But these figures are before all the new treatments available today..Provenge is just one of them.. How prostate cancer behaves can be very hard to predict..Some men respond well to treatment and live a long time. Others do not respond so well and their prognosis is not as good.....If you and your dad have not yet read Dr. Walsh's book, now would be a good time to do so..It will answer many of your questions...See Dr. Walsh at the top of the forum page...

The two books I mentioned will help you make your treatment decision..And of course there is a wealth of information stored in this forum, the good, the bad and the ugly, it's all here....You should know your G-7, PSA 4.8 cancer has a very high cure rate no matter what treatment path you choose...It's the skill of your doctors not the treatment method that determines success or failure on this journey....Do your homework, make your decision and don't look back....",

      "Content": "If the doctor that is treating him is a Urologist, it's time to consult with a Medical Oncologist...Also, there is such a thing as PSA Bounce, a temporary spike in PSA that can occur after radiation treatment. A visit with his Radiation Oncologist might be in order to see if that's a possibility..The \"shot\" he was given was probably Lupron or a Lupron type drug that amounts to chemical castration. There will be side-effects from that... Mortality prognosis is difficult to predict until metastasis to the bones is confirmed..Then that 5 year average is correct. At tens years, 90% have died..But these figures are before all the new treatments available today..Provenge is just one of them.. How prostate cancer behaves can be very hard to predict..Some men respond well to treatment and live a long time. Others do not respond so well and their prognosis is not as good.....If you and your dad have not yet read Dr. Walsh's book, now would be a good time to do so..It will answer many of your questions...See Dr. Walsh at the top of the forum page... Best of luck to your Dad....",

A drug called bicalutimide can sometimes help to achieve this..This treatment is usually effective for 3 to 5 years before he becomes hormone refractory, the lack of testosterone stops working, and other drugs can be used to further extend his life..A new study has shown the Docetaxel chemo, started early, can extend patients lives longer than otherwise expected...However, the side-effects from this treatment can degrade quality of life to the point the benefit obtained is not worth the suffering caused by the drug..Some men tolerate it better than others..His Indian Oncologist seems to be offering state of the art treatment, all things considered..",

The two books I mentioned will help you make your treatment decision..And of course there is a wealth of information stored in this forum, the good, the bad and the ugly, it's all here....You should know your G-7, PSA 4.8 cancer has a very high cure rate no matter what treatment path you choose...It's the skill of your doctors not the treatment method that determines success or failure on this journey....Do your homework, make your decision and don't look back....",

      "Content": "Dr Walsh's book, mentioned in the sticky threads, covers advanced disease in the last few chapters..It's comprehensive and worth reading..Usually, the hormone treatment or ADT will control the cancer for two or three years, giving you time to investigate the new drugs and treatments just coming into use, some of which are very effective..Clinical trials give you a shot at the very latest treatments..You may have to travel to one of the big cancer research centers to take advantage of these...If your husband is still being treated by a urologist, it's time to consult with a Medical Oncologist, preferably one who specializes in prostate cancer..Have his testosterone level checked also when they do the next PSA test. Sometimes the drugs don't work as advertized. It's important the \"T\" level is reduced to castrate level..You might ask about the \"triple blockade\", a combination of 3 hormonal drugs, which deprive the cancer of what it needs from three different directions.. Best of luck to both you and your husband..",

      "Content": "Hello... Sorry you are here...When your Dad was diagnosed, did they do a biopsy of his prostate gland ? If so, there would be a Gleason score which can be important in selecting treatment and predicting the future..At 65, he should be on Medicare and it sounds like he can get the \"Extra Help\" option which eliminates most if not all the co-pays....So the financial side should not be that big a problem... As for treatment, most men get a big response to ADT (Lupron) and that scary PSA number will hopefully collapse to almost nothing..The ADT by itself usually produces a 2 -3 year remission. Yes, the ADT has some unpleasant side-effects but not as bad as the alternative. Starting chemo sooner rather than later has also proved to be effective.. If your dad is still being treated by a Urologist, it's time to visit with a Medical Oncologist. Their training and knowledge is focused on treating cancer which is what you need right now... With PC, every case is different, every case responds differently to treatment so making predictions about mortality is impossible..But rest assured, most of us, even the stage 4, Gleason 9 guys can and do survive for many years. Everyday, new, advanced drugs and treatments are coming online. Many of us live to die from something other than Prostate Cancer..",

But every case is different so it's hard to predict..You can chart his PSA doubling time and get a pretty good idea of how quickly the cancer is spreading....",

      "Content": "Surgery, once called the \"Gold Standard\" has not changed much in 10 or 15 years..Radiation treatment on the other hand has been making great strides in how it is performed, the equipment that is used and the techniques involved..It's ability to produce a cure is much improved over what it was just a few years ago... As for your second opinion, I would consult a Medical Oncologist referred by your primary care doctor, not your Urologist. Then have that MO recommend an radiation oncologist to consult with. Most of the books dealing with prostate cancer, including Dr. Walsh's have become obsolete over the past few years, that's how fast things are changing..Much of the information you will find that's written about PC is aimed at the 65% who are diagnosed as being Gleason 6. But you are a Gleason 8 which puts you in a completely different category. The treatment recommended for you will be much more aggressive than those with G-6 and G-7 prostate cancer...The latest thinking seems to be that radiation, especially the combination of Brachytherapy and beam radiation is more effective at curing high-risk prostate cancer than surgery is...So do your homework and don't be rushed into making a treatment decision..",

That's one of it's benefits..Casodex is low cost but it is not the most effective form of hormone treatment. If the pain is being caused by bone mets (metastasis to the bones, common with PC) this can sometimes be treated effectively with spot radiation treatment..If that is not an option, then opiate pain killers can at least control the pain so he is comfortable.. How old is Dad? There are two food supplements that have been shown to slow down progression of prostate cancer. Pomegranate juice or extract and something called IP-6..These don't offer dramatic improvements but it's better than nothing... Best of luck to you and your Dad, we are all here to help you....",

      "Content": "Dr Walsh's book, mentioned in the sticky threads, covers advanced disease in the last few chapters..It's comprehensive and worth reading..Usually, the hormone treatment or ADT will control the cancer for two or three years, giving you time to investigate the new drugs and treatments just coming into use, some of which are very effective..Clinical trials give you a shot at the very latest treatments..You may have to travel to one of the big cancer research centers to take advantage of these...If your husband is still being treated by a urologist, it's time to consult with a Medical Oncologist, preferably one who specializes in prostate cancer..Have his testosterone level checked also when they do the next PSA test. Sometimes the drugs don't work as advertized. It's important the \"T\" level is reduced to castrate level..You might ask about the \"triple blockade\", a combination of 3 hormonal drugs, which deprive the cancer of what it needs from three different directions.. Best of luck to both you and your husband..",

As for your second opinion, I would consult a Medical Oncologist referred by your primary care doctor, not your Urologist. Then have that MO recommend an radiation oncologist to consult with. Most of the books dealing with prostate cancer, including Dr. Walsh's have become obsolete over the past few years, that's how fast things are changing..Much of the information you will find that's written about PC is aimed at the 65% who are diagnosed as being Gleason 6. But you are a Gleason 8 which puts you in a completely different category. The treatment recommended for you will be much more aggressive than those with G-6 and G-7 prostate cancer...The latest thinking seems to be that radiation, especially the combination of Brachytherapy and beam radiation is more effective at curing high-risk prostate cancer than surgery is...So do your homework and don't be rushed into making a treatment decision..",

The big name doctor you talked to might be in the room with his student closely watching and directing him but the guy actually operating the robot might be a complete newbee....Everybody tells you be sure your surgeon has at least 300 procedures..Some say 400..One guy here says 1000 is needed..But how do these surgeons build up their numbers count ?? Many, many men get successfully operated on by surgeons with far fewer than 300 robotic surgeries under their belt..So be sure to verify exactly WHO will be in the daVinci robot's drivers seat....The Master or his Student..",

Nothing to do now but wait, get healed up, and study up on all your options. The Urologists job is pretty much done. It's time to visit with a Medical Oncologist and get his viewpoints on how to proceed...have your PCP refer you to one, not your urologist. Try to find an MO who specializes in PC or at least find one who treats a lot of PC patients..Next step may be a couple of scans to see if your cancer has spread anywhere else..Todays scanning technology has made huge advances, makes deciding on a treatment path much easier and more productive... Best of luck to you....",

Perhaps a full body scan using one of the newer scan techniques (F-18 Choline comes to mind) that can spot the location of any metastasis at an early stage and make treatment more focused..But yes, ADT will indeed be the next treatment approach and it can be very effective. Unfortunately, the side-effects can be difficult to manage for some men..The man-boob thing is the least of it..That's two or three years down the road, he can wait on that for awhile..",

Hormone treatment can take the form of injections, pills or surgical castration.. When HT quits working, either chemo or Provenge are the next things that are tried. Then Xtandi maybe..Zytiga is another drug that sometimes delivers good results..But NONE of these drugs or treatments offer a cure...They just slow down the progression of the cancer for a while..Even in the States, you must have good insurance or be wealthy to afford these advanced drugs.... Many of us being treated for PC take a supplement or two, Pomegranate being the most popular.. By the way, how old are you?",

      "Content": "I'm 73 and on ADT..Are you seeing a Medical Oncologist? He should be directing the hormone treatment, not your urologist..The surgical procedure is probably the best if you can deal with it..It's the cheapest and most effective.. Yes, ADT increases heart attack risk but so what? The increased risk is manageable..You must be careful to avoid weight gain.. It's hard to predict how effective ADT will be for you. Everyone responds a little differently. Many men get a nice long remission, 5 years or more..Some men do not..... Now or later, good question...You could wait a few months and get a better idea of your PSA doubling time. This is a gauge of how fast your cancer is growing..If the doubling time is short, then starting treatment is more urgent..A drug called Casodex might be useful to you. G-9 prostate cancer (me too) is a whole different ball game..There are other, newer drugs and treatments for advanced prostate cancer. Provenge, Zytiga, Xtandi are effective but not curative..Insurance generally will not pay for them (they are VERY expensive) until the ADT stops working.. They are hoping you will die before they have to pay for those drugs...One thing that has proven effective, doing Docetaxel (Chemo) now instead of later. Your overall condition may or may not allow doing chemo...the side effects can be rough...Best of luck to you...!",

Radiation treatments including \"seeds\" work well too but your husband is young and radiations worst side effects tend to happen many years after the treatment has been performed, when your husband can be expected to still be alive..So don't be rushed into anything, investigate all your options, make your decision and don't look back...

They may recommend HT, hormone treatment, which will control the cancer as long as it needs to be controlled. Then again, they just as likely will just let it ride and not subject him to the HT side effects...There are a couple of drugs that may be useful, Avodart and Proscar which carry a minimal side effect load...

      "Content": "Lumps and bumps are not good...In the States, there are a few Urologists that use a more advanced ultrasound probe to examine the prostate and guide biopsy needles..It's called a Color Doppler Ultrasound...In expert hands, it can help the Urologist determine whether a \"nodule\" is dangerous or not and whether a biopsy is warranted..An even more advanced test called \"CTC\" stands for circulating tumor cells can find cancer cells, any cancer cells, circulating freely in your blood. Unfortunately, this test is very expensive and has not been approved as a part of routine PC screening....So Urologists still rely on the PSA & DRE to guide them when making biopsy recommendations..Best of luck to you..",

The biopsy itself is nothing to fear, takes about 15 minutes, uncomfortable but painless if properly done. Some blood in the urine and semen for a few days afterwards..But now, you know where you stand, there is no guesswork...But from now on, biopsy or no, you need to have your PSA checked every 6 months.

      "Content": "You said his PSA has risen....What's the number? At this point, it's time to consider passing on his care to a Medical Oncologist. The Urologist can do little more for him. Perhaps a full body scan using one of the newer scan techniques (F-18 Choline comes to mind) that can spot the location of any metastasis at an early stage and make treatment more focused..But yes, ADT will indeed be the next treatment approach and it can be very effective. Unfortunately, the side-effects can be difficult to manage for some men..The man-boob thing is the least of it..That's two or three years down the road, he can wait on that for awhile..",

If you are terrified by the thought of having a biopsy, see if you can arrange having a T-3 MRI scan of your prostate.

Then again, they just as likely will just let it ride and not subject him to the HT side effects...There are a couple of drugs that may be useful, Avodart and Proscar which carry a minimal side effect load... Best of luck to you both!",

Your primary care doctor can perform these tests for you..Surgery is not usually recommended in advanced cases, it can't cure you if the horse has left the barn..But it CAN remove 98% or more of the cancer and that leaves just 2% (or whatever) to deal with and not 100%..Radiation might be a better choice as they can focus the beam on a wider area..Lots of things happen back stage, between the doctors and the insurance companies..(radiation costs about 4 times as much as surgery) In this business, nothing happens until it's decided who is going to pay for it..",

      "Content": "For an informed answer, we need more information...His age, PSA before surgery, the results of the post surgery pathology report, (Gleason score, positive margins?) These are the things that will determine the need for salvage or adjunct radiation.. But generally, you want his recovery from the surgery to be complete before radiation is begun. You want to see his PSA at 8-12 weeks post surgery..Any ED or incontinence problems will be locked into place by the radiation, no more improvement after that... Also, it is becoming standard to include HT, hormone therapy for at least a year, more often 2 years, before, during and after radiation as it has been shown to make the radiation more effective..He can start that anytime, the sooner the better. of course, that will lock in the ED for as long as he is on it... The doctors can recommend and offer treatments but YOU decide which ones you wish to pursue..Always get a second opinion before you commit to treatments that come with serious side-effects. One of the doctors you talk to should be a Medical Oncologist, not a Urologist or Radiation Oncologist..These people all have different viewpoints and sometimes they conflict. Only YOU can decide what's best for YOU....Best of luck on this sometimes rough journey... Okay, I checked back and see he is 51 and a G-7..That being the case, if it were me, I would wait until the next PSA test at 8-12 weeks. If it's UNDETECTABLE, that's the goal of surgery, then there is no rush to begin the radiation...Unless of course the post-op pathology report was really ugly..",

      "Content": "For an informed answer, we need more information...His age, PSA before surgery, the results of the post surgery pathology report, (Gleason score, positive margins?) These are the things that will determine the need for salvage or adjunct radiation.. But generally, you want his recovery from the surgery to be complete before radiation is begun. You want to see his PSA at 8-12 weeks post surgery..Any ED or incontinence problems will be locked into place by the radiation, no more improvement after that... Also, it is becoming standard to include HT, hormone therapy for at least a year, more often 2 years, before, during and after radiation as it has been shown to make the radiation more effective..He can start that anytime, the sooner the better. of course, that will lock in the ED for as long as he is on it... The doctors can recommend and offer treatments but YOU decide which ones you wish to pursue..Always get a second opinion before you commit to treatments that come with serious side-effects. One of the doctors you talk to should be a Medical Oncologist, not a Urologist or Radiation Oncologist..These people all have different viewpoints and sometimes they conflict. Only YOU can decide what's best for YOU....Best of luck on this sometimes rough journey... Okay, I checked back and see he is 51 and a G-7..That being the case, if it were me, I would wait until the next PSA test at 8-12 weeks. If it's UNDETECTABLE, that's the goal of surgery, then there is no rush to begin the radiation...Unless of course the post-op pathology report was really ugly..",

      "Content": "You should both read Dr. Pat Walsh's book, \"Guide to surviving Prostate cancer, third edition\" The chances of the 3+4=7 and 4+3=7 Gleason scores being inaccurate are pretty slim..Any competent Pathologist can spot and identify grade 4 prostate cancer..And it's the grade 4 component that you need to worry about... The success of the surgery depends largely on the skill of the surgeon, it's as simple as that. Your surgeon should have done AT LEAST 300 robotic prostate removals to be considered an expert....Side-effect results can vary widely..Incontinence occurs about 20% of time..And some degree of impotence occurs 50% of the time, nerve-sparing procedure or not....Again, the skill of the surgeon is all-important...Usually, both the incontinence and the impotence can be treated successfully. Radiation treatment (there are several forms) offers good results and fewer immediate side-effects..But in a 39 year old man who can be expected to live another 40 years or more, the long-term side-effects of heavy-dose radiation treatment can weigh heavy on your treatment decision... Don't rush into ANY treatment until you understand all the options and are comfortable with your choice...You only get one shot at this....",

      "Content": "One thing to keep in mind. Prostate cancer tends to be multi-focal. You can not depend on the 12 shot needle biopsy to have found every tumor. There is still a possibility that a more aggressive tumor escaped detection by the biopsy procedure. The chance of this occurring is in the 20-30% range...Where does that number come from? When men choose surgery and the entire gland is removed and biopsied, about 30 percent of the time the original Gleason score is updated to a higher number than the needle biopsy revealed..So if you choose AS as your treatment choice, you need to do everything possible to rule out the possibility that a more aggressive form of cancer might be undiscovered....Your G-6 diagnosis is a great place to start and gives you plenty of time to consider all your treatment options...Best of luck to you...",

      "Content": "We are both in the same boat, along with many others..At this point, as Newporter suggested, it's time to find a Medical Oncologist who tends to specialize in prostate cancer..Urologists don't have the specialized cancer training that oncologists do..Hormone therapy is definitely the next step..It comes with a big side-effect load but it's very effective for most men and it can hold the cancer in check for many years. The AVERAGE effective period is about 3 years before the cancer becomes refractory, which means the cancer has developed the ability to grow without any testosterone support..Today, drugs are used (Lupron) to stop testosterone production. In the past it was castration, which is still the most effective form of ADT..Pomegranate juice or extract has been proven to slow PSA doubling time. So has aspirin, but aspirin can cause nasty stomach and intestinal problems so don't take it without a doctors advise.. When to start hormone therapy...There are two schools of thought..One is to wait until your PSA reaches some predetermined level, anywhere from 10 to 50 or higher before starting HT. This gives you some time without suffering the HT side-effects but it allows the cancer to progress unchecked, perhaps to the point where bone metastases are detected which is not a good thing. Then the HT is begun with the hope that it will completely suppress and control the cancer.. The other school of thought is to start the ADT right away so it can suppress the cancer while it's still very small and prevent mets to the bones for as long as possible. Studies have shown that there is little if any difference in survival time between the two methods..Some doctors use intermittent HT, giving their patients a break from the drugs until the PSA begins to rise again..This method offers no survival advantage. Fortunately, there are several new drugs and treatments coming online or already approved that have shown great promise in trials.. While none of them offer a cure, they all offer a considerable increase in survival times... While nobody can accurately predict prostate cancer survival time, and new cancer treatment discoveries are coming quickly now, you and I should be good for another 6 to 10 years if you stay on top of it and use all the tools available..",

      "Content": "The BEST surgeons can achieve a high cure rate and minimize the chances of serious side-effects, which are different than \"complications\" but again, the good doctors don't have too many complications either..With the impotence thing, much depends on how potent you are now...If you need \"a little help\" now, then you will probably need a lot of help after the surgery and radiation offers no free lunch in that regard..It just takes longer to manifest itself.. I chose surgery because if it fails, you get a second chance at a cure with radiation..If you choose radiation as your primary treatment and it fails, you get no second shot at a cure...In my case, G-9, both the surgery and radiation failed and I'm completely impotent.. \"with a pathology report saying the gleason was 6- Is that possible with 2 of them 6 and 2 of them 7?. Psa had climbed to 5.9, still under 6.\" No, not possible..If just one sample had any Grade 4 cancer in it, you are Gleason 7 and that's that. It's the highest grade found that counts, not the lowest.. You should be aware that biopsies are often upgraded to a higher score after surgery when the entire prostate gland can be examined..Needle Biopsies only sample a tiny percentage of the total tissue volume..",

To give yourself the best shot, in my opinion, you hit it as hard as you can with everything you can as soon as you can...The best outcomes <SEEM> to be achieved when all 3 treatments are used. Surgery to remove most of the cancer and if you get lucky, all of it. Radiation combined with a year or two of hormone therapy to clean up anything that's left. That was the plan I followed and so far it has worked for me. Yes, this will also subject you to the full range of side-effects associated with these treatments. Every case is different and we all make our own treatment choices based on many different things..Most men with PC have Gleason 6 cancer, 45-50% can get by with much less aggressive treatment. Much of what you will read online is aimed at those men..But men in the Gleason 9 situation, we need to follow a different path if we expect to die from something other than prostate cancer...I hope my views do not offend you or anyone else who may read this..You should read Dr. Walsh's book and consult with several doctors who are PC experts before you make your treatment decision...

Radiation has come a long way...The latest generation of LINACS (the machines that deliver the radiation) are light-years ahead of the older equipment in their ability to deliver the radiation where it's needed and to avoid damaging nearby healthy tissue. If you go with SRT, ask for a Varian RapidArc or better. It costs no more...Near-term, side-effects are minimal..A little fatigue and a feeling of urinary urgency near the end of the treatment cycle..Long term maybe a secondary cancer caused by the radiation but you will be in your 80's....",

Explained my quandary..He gave it some thought and then told me \"I would try the surgery first, and move on to radiation if that fails\"....I took his advise..The surgery DID fail, my PSA hung at 0.9..Not only that, I developed a hospital acquired staff infection that put me back in the hospital for a week and I.V. antibiotics for a month..My only lingering side-effect is 100% impotence..The hot flashes have stopped now that I'm off the HT but I've lost some muscle mass.

The reason many RO's recommend 24 months is because that's the time period the clinical trial used that discovered that ADT could boost the effectiveness of radiation by 50%..Recently, there has been a tendency to use shorter time periods because it has been found that 1 year works ALMOST as good as 2 years...But with high risk guys, 2 years is pretty much standard...Oh, don't ask a urologist about radiation doses or hormone therapy.

I read that blog...The writer should have read Dr. Walsh's book a long time ago..Urologists and surgeons don't have the training to treat cancer..Once the primary treatment fails, it's time to let a Medical Oncologist who specializes in prostate cancer direct any further treatment...Maybe they can extend your life until you die from something else and maybe they can't..Some forms of Prostate Cancer can't be cured no matter how early they are found...They metastasize before they are detected..The Gleason grade is a fairly good predictor of this... Only the patient can decide whether the cost and side-effects of the treatment is worth any possible benefit that might be obtained...Some of the old, forgotten, off patent treatments like estrogen patches or pills work just as good as the new $10,000 a month therapies..The Hemlock Society offers another path but I'll probably get my wrist slapped just for mentioning those two words...",

At some point, it will start to rise. Then the rate of rise becomes important, called PSA doubling time..Slower is better. In the U.S. there are several drugs and treatments that can be given and these can extend patients lives considerably. They are expensive. Things like Xtandi and Provenge.. There are a few food supplements that have been shown to slow down the progression of PC. Pomegranate, IP-6, Turmeric, Broccoli have all been used with success..

Also, just because the samples provided to the pathologist return a low volume Gleason 6 report, you can't be SURE there is not some more aggressive cancer lurking undiscovered..The ONLY way to determine that is to remove the entire gland and examine it..In about 30% of PC cases, when surgery is chosen and the gland removed, the final pathology report reveals more aggressive cancer undiscovered by the original biopsy....",

If the prostate cancer has metastasized, it's still prostate cancer, not \"bone cancer\"..When the ADT (hormone therapy, Lupron & Casodex) fail to control the cancer, it's called \"Hormone Refractory\" and that makes him eligible for several newer treatments including Xtandi & Zitiga.

I think you could go another 2 or 3 months, have another PSA test and make your biopsy decision at that point...If the upward trend continues, it's time for a biopsy....Much of your increased PSA is most likely due to the enlarged prostate..You might ask your Uro about going on Avodart for a couple of months and see how your PSA responds to that...In most healthy men, it will cut your PSA in half. If PC is present, the drop in PSA will not be so dramatic..",

      "Content": "First, you want to be completely continent (if possible) before you start any radiation treatment. Radiation will freeze your recovery from the surgery right where it is..At this point in your treatment, the HT is used to increase the effectiveness of the radiation..Recent studies have shown radiation is twice as effective when HT is in place during and after the radiation treatment. While HT by itself might have some post-surgical benefit, that has not been demonstrated.. With the positive node and Gleason 9, doing adjunct radiation and hormone treatment is pretty much the standard treatment. I too am a G-9 and have undergone all three treatments..My post surgery PSA never dropped below 0.9 but it has been undetectable since the end of my RT...My radiation oncologist at first wanted me on HT for 2 years but relented and stopped the Eligard (Lupron clone) after 14 months on the strength of my undetectable PSA and my complaints about the side-effects..The latest studies show that 12 months of HT is almost as effective as 24 or 36 when used as a adjunct to radiation..Many doctors will still press for 24 or even 36 months which can bring on some pretty heavy side-effects and make recovery from HT slow and difficult, if you recover at all.. Before you jump on the treatment table under a LINAC, try and find the most up to date machine you can..Many treatment centers are still using 10 and 15 year old equipment which is at a disadvantage when compared to the newest machines which can be aimed more accurately and deliver a higher dose while doing less damage to surrounding healthy tissue...Ask your R.O. this question: \"Do you have access to a Varian RapidArc ?\" and see what he has to say....Like surgeons, all R.O.'s are not the same..Find the best one you can, one that has treated hundreds of prostate patients..They will write the computer program that controls the LINAC during your treatment... I had 40 \"fractions\" 72 Gray, full pelvic, and like you, the last 7 were called \"Boost\" and tightly aimed at the prostate bed. Best of luck to you....",

Not that long ago, they reserved chemo until the last resort but they have found that by starting it sooner it seems to work much better ..The chemo drugs they use against PC are not as nasty as those used against other types of cancers..Most men get through it okay...Another thing.. With PC, it's almost impossible to give an accurate prognosis...Every man, every case, responds differently. In some men, the ADT will provide a solid 5 year remission with Dad leading a pretty normal life..In others, the ADT will stop working in a year or less and nobody knows exactly why...You just have to play the cards you are dealt, be your own advocate, learn everything you can and never look back. Encourage Dad to exercise as much as he can. He will feel better and live longer for it. YES the ADT does cause fatigue and a lack of enthusiasm for things he once enjoyed..Don't let him slip into the recliner and just drift away...Get him to agree to an exercise plan and help him to stick to it. It will make a big difference..So who is this guy Fairwind giving all this advise? I'm someone just like your Dad, 75 years old, terminal prostate cancer, been through the meat grinder, but I try to enjoy every day that's given to me and I still have some good time left. When I was a teenager, I never thought I'd make it this far so no regrets, it's all bonus time now.....enjoy every minute of it. Best of luck to you and your Dad.....",

      "Content": "Before the drugs like Lupron were discovered, orchiectomy, surgical castration, was the standard treatment..For men likely to need hormone treatment for the duration, it's still a viable option. It lowers testosterone to the lowest level possible and it works very quickly. Typical cost is less than half of one Lupron shot so for men without medical insurance, it offers effective, low cost treatment...There are other drugs more expensive than Lupron that claim to work better but insurance companies will seldom approve them... If drugs like Lupron are to be used, the \"T\" level needs to be monitored closely to make sure the drug is working well enough to be effective. Some oncologists will prescribe 3 different drugs, \"The Triple Blockade\", to get the maximum cancer fighting effect.",

      "Content": "When prostate cancer is diagnosed, in about 65% of the cases, the Gleason grade is Gleason 6. Now the standard 12 core needle biopsy sometimes misses higher grade cancer that is only found if and when the prostate is surgically removed and the entire gland biopsied..But that leaves the MAJORITY of PC cases in the G-6 catagory which it is believed virtually never metastasizes of spreads beyond the prostate gland. This makes 'Doing Nothing\" a good plan for the majority of PC patients..But what about the 40-45% who's Gleason score is something other than Gleason 6? For them \"Doing Nothing\" can be a death sentence. Lets not forget that 35,000 men will DIE from prostate cancer this year.. So when you see these studies that claim treating prostate cancer is a waste of time because treatment apparently has no effect on the mortality rate, I must take these studies with a grain of salt....Today's mortality rate from prostate cancer is much, much lower than it was 30 years ago, before the PSA test and effective treatments.....The G-6 guys never knew they had cancer and the G-8, 9 and 10 guys were dead in two or three years....",

      "Content": "We Boomers have a tough time facing our mortality....Nobody gets out alive, that's all there is to it...Yes, I know it's a big shock when the Reaper suddenly moves into sharper focus but your Dad still has quite a few years of \"Quality Time\" left to be with you and the rest of his family..Enjoy every minute of it...As time goes by, the ADT will deliver it's load of depressing side-effects but they are all manageable and a lot better than the alternative...As MM-16 pointed out, there are many advanced treatments available and more on the way. Not that long ago, they reserved chemo until the last resort but they have found that by starting it sooner it seems to work much better ..The chemo drugs they use against PC are not as nasty as those used against other types of cancers..Most men get through it okay...Another thing.. With PC, it's almost impossible to give an accurate prognosis...Every man, every case, responds differently. In some men, the ADT will provide a solid 5 year remission with Dad leading a pretty normal life..In others, the ADT will stop working in a year or less and nobody knows exactly why...You just have to play the cards you are dealt, be your own advocate, learn everything you can and never look back. Encourage Dad to exercise as much as he can. He will feel better and live longer for it. YES the ADT does cause fatigue and a lack of enthusiasm for things he once enjoyed..Don't let him slip into the recliner and just drift away...Get him to agree to an exercise plan and help him to stick to it. It will make a big difference..So who is this guy Fairwind giving all this advise? I'm someone just like your Dad, 75 years old, terminal prostate cancer, been through the meat grinder, but I try to enjoy every day that's given to me and I still have some good time left. When I was a teenager, I never thought I'd make it this far so no regrets, it's all bonus time now.....enjoy every minute of it. Best of luck to you and your Dad.....",

      "Content": "I suspect there might be some insurance issues going on backstage as Radiation Treatment is VERY expensive..So waiting until October to begin treatment would be understandable...Putting you on HT now will make the radiation more effective, 50% more effective than it otherwise would be..Three years was the old \"standard\" for adjunct hormone treatment but it has been found that two years and even one year delivers almost the same benefit..Your Radiation Oncologist will discuss this with you..It's a quality of life thing..Three years on HT can be rough and recovering from it at that point is very difficult if not impossible. The changes and damage become permanent...It takes a year before the full effects of the ADT are felt..Start taking your calcium pills to protect your bones and adjust your diet to control the weight gain..Don't let that get away from you...The hot flashes peak at about 6 months then slowly subside....The ED becomes profound but the good news is you will no longer care about it..You sex partner may have a slightly different viewpoint...So when you meet your Radiation Oncologist, you will want to discuss in detail the treatment benefit as opposed to the quality of life impact that Hormone Treatment involves..",

When used for treating prostate cancer, no advantage has been demonstrated either in the success rate or the side-effect risk. One thing for certain, it costs MUCH more than traditional photon (X-ray) treatment which is expensive enough already. Most insurance companies will deny proton treatment for prostate cancer because equally effective but much cheaper photon treatment is available... One thing to investigate, it has been demonstrated that the usual 40 fraction treatments can safely be reduced to 25 or so greatly reducing the cost and the stress endured by the patient..If you do your homework you can find the studies and clinical trials that support having fewer treatments...As you might expect, many Radiation Oncologists will resist this change...",

PSA is NOT a marker for cancer, BUT, it does not move from 5.5 to 9.0 for no reason...Urologists get paid a lot of money to discover accurately what that reason is....",

You need a to find a way to bridge that gap..Casodex has a generic counterpart, Bicalutamide, which is not very expensive. This Foundation will provide FREE Lupron if you meet certain terms..Usually these terms are quite liberal. There are more organizations out there that can and will help.. https://www.pparx.org/prescription_a..._lupaneta_pack Typically, they will see how Lupron alone works..Most men get a good response..When it starts to fail they will add the bicalutamide and the combined drugs usually result in another remission..Hopefully, you will now be covered under Medicare when you become \"hormone refractory\" (the drugs stop working) and you can move on to Zytiga or Xtandi which can produce a dramatic responce and another prolonged remission... So make a few phone calls and you will get what you need....",

PSA is NOT a marker for cancer, BUT, it does not move from 5.5 to 9.0 for no reason...Urologists get paid a lot of money to discover accurately what that reason is....",

      "Content": "You might be jumping the gun on the Zytiga..There are rules that must be followed before your insurance will pay for it..Generally speaking, the Lupron and Casodex combination must stop working before your doctor can prescribe it..Your PSA is virtually undetectable, I would wait for a couple of increases before I started salvage radiation...But the Lupron will mask that, your PSA will probably drop to zero (undetectable) so the need for radiation will be impossible to determine.. It is impossible to predict your mortality..It will be at least 2 years before it can be determined if you are cured or not..With prostate cancer, every case is different. Every case responds differently to treatment. New drugs, treatments and techniques are coming online rapidly making the future impossible to predict.",

It is impossible to predict your mortality..It will be at least 2 years before it can be determined if you are cured or not..With prostate cancer, every case is different. Every case responds differently to treatment. New drugs, treatments and techniques are coming online rapidly making the future impossible to predict.",

With a PSA of 5, your scans will probably be clean..That means your treatment team can go for a CURE..That's right, CURE..At 71, surgery is pretty risky so that leaves some form of radiation treatment, which is just as effective but with fewer potential side-effects..The Gleason 9 puts you the high-risk group so you can expect aggressive treatment to be recommended..Is the Grim Reaper just a step behind you ?? NO !! With today's treatments and drugs with more coming soon, they can CURE you or worst case, keep you going for another 8 or 10 years...So enjoy the weekend and stop worrying about things you can't do anything about..

Minor differences between labs will not alter your treatment one way or the other..Same goes for a negative finding..If your report comes back clean, the chances of an expert lab contradicting that are very small...Best of luck on your upcoming report!",

Unfortunately, the answer to this is probably not. Once PC has metastasized to the bones, going back and removing the primary tumor has not proven to be effective treatment..Another factor, because this would be considered high-risk surgery (because of his age and the extent of his cancer) few surgeons would be willing participants as the risks involved outweigh any possible benefits delivered....You can also expect your insurance company to balk (yes, even Medicare) because they would judge it to be inappropriate treatment.... You might have a better chance of getting radiation treatment (consult with a Radiation Oncologist) approved because it's less risky and it MIGHT provide a worthwhile extension of his survival, especially if you could convince the providers and the insurance company that you wanted to work outside the box and try a combination of the newer treatments available. Treating the bone mets with Xofigo might be worth a try... Xtandi is another new drug that in some men has had spectacular results...Don't overlook clinical trials as a way to receive advanced treatment at no cost....It all depends on how hard you and Dad want to fight this thing...But Stage 4 terminal cancer is what it is....At some point you must face this and deal with it..

Once PC has metastasized to the bones, going back and removing the primary tumor has not proven to be effective treatment..Another factor, because this would be considered high-risk surgery (because of his age and the extent of his cancer) few surgeons would be willing participants as the risks involved outweigh any possible benefits delivered....You can also expect your insurance company to balk (yes, even Medicare) because they would judge it to be inappropriate treatment.... You might have a better chance of getting radiation treatment (consult with a Radiation Oncologist) approved because it's less risky and it MIGHT provide a worthwhile extension of his survival, especially if you could convince the providers and the insurance company that you wanted to work outside the box and try a combination of the newer treatments available. Treating the bone mets with Xofigo might be worth a try... Xtandi is another new drug that in some men has had spectacular results...Don't overlook clinical trials as a way to receive advanced treatment at no cost....It all depends on how hard you and Dad want to fight this thing...But Stage 4 terminal cancer is what it is....At some point you must face this and deal with it.. Best of luck to you both.....",

Do you remember his Gleason score when he was diagnosed? It is normal for HT to stop working after a period of time..Traditional Chemo has not proven to be very effective against PC, especially when you consider it's side-effects. At age 79, side-effects can be just as fatal as the cancer. There are some new drugs that have just been approved and are fairly effective.

When cancer is found and the gland surgically removed, a close examination of those needle tracks never finds any cancer in them..The needles come out clean. The same holds true for the numerous other types of cancer that needle biopsies are used to detect and verify..Cancer spreads to other parts of the body when metastasis occurs, not from needle biopsies..",

If so, one of the new sensitive scans might be able to spot the exact location of your cancer so the R.O. can target it..From here on I would let your Oncologist take over the roll of directing your treatment..You will discover that Urologists and Oncologists compete with each other when it comes to treating prostate cancer patients but since your surgery failed to cure you, your urologist is working outside his area of expertise. By professional courtesy, he may continue to administer your Lupron shots which are very profitable and easy money....But I would let the Oncologist call the shots....I am not a doctor and this is just my opinion....",

At age 50 surgery will probably be the favored treatment, but not always. Radiation has made great improvements lately..Also, investigate how much of this your health insurance is going to cover..Better to know these things beforehand and not get blindsided with a huge bill...Best of luck to you...And yes, read Dr. Walsh's book...",

At age 50 surgery will probably be the favored treatment, but not always. Radiation has made great improvements lately..Also, investigate how much of this your health insurance is going to cover..Better to know these things beforehand and not get blindsided with a huge bill...Best of luck to you...And yes, read Dr. Walsh's book...",

      "Content": "\"show that the aggressiveness of a prostate tumor could be established at the time of tumor formation.\" This is not exactly a new discovery..Dr. Walsh, in his popular book, has suspected this for a long time..When a cancerous prostate gland is removed and biopsied, on average, there are 7 distinct and separate tumors..They can be grade 3, 4 or 5 or a mix of the three grades all in the same gland..Many feel it is rare for a Gleason 6 (3+3) to mutate into a more aggressive grade tumor. What is more likely, there was an undiscovered tumor of higher grade hidden in the prostate all along... If a cancer is not discovered very early, the more aggressive tumors can spread and overwhelm the less aggressive cells, merging into one mass of high-grade tumor cells....This does not mean the Gleason 6 cancer turned into a Gleason 9 cancer..It means the G-9 tumor, undetected at first, overwhelmed the nearby G-6 tumor.... Those on AS, Active Surveillance, should have annual biopsies to be sure this progression is not occurring....When G-6 patients choose to have surgery, 30% of the time when the pathology report comes back, more aggressive cancer is found that the original biopsy missed...",

      "Content": "Gleason 9 puts you in the high risk group....Studies have shown that when RT is combined with a 2 or 3 year period of hormone treatment the cure rate is considerably better..Even just 1 year on HT results in improved outcomes...At the moment, the Lupron has reduced your PSA to undetectable. I have gone through the same thing thing you are going through, only I had surgery (failed) before the radiation and HT. After 18 months on HT I said no more.....I was in the zero club (undetectable PSA) and thought I was cured. Six months later my zero club membership was revoked and it was back on Lupron and Casodex, probably for the rest of my life... Your \"T\" level is still 23.7 which is not ideal for fighting PC..It should be below 20 and below 10 is even better. If you choose to stop HT then it's not an issue but if you continue, you might ask about a different drug which might give better testosterone suppression.. Your case is different because you still have a prostate gland. So you can expect your PSA to become measurable when you stop the HT. If your RT was successful, your PSA should level off at some low figure called \"nadir\". But if your PSA resumes a steady climb then it's back on HT forever..",

      "Content": "Remember this..All the specialists will recommend whatever treatment they perform...Business is business..To me, and I could be wrong, when they need to implant the gold markets, they are using an older LINAC (the machine that administers the radiation). The newest equipment no longer needs the markers to accurately aim the beam....Also, today, brachytherapy, seeds, have made big improvements especially when combined with beam radiation. The two used in conjunction can deliver the highest overall dose while maintaining lower side-effect risk..If your RO is shy about Brachytherapy, it's probably because he does not perform the procedure..I would locate and consult with an RO who does perform it AND IS EXPERT AT IT.... One more thing to investigate..Radiation treatment is very expensive. Always get preapprovals from your insurance company. Find out what your payment responsibility will be before you agree to any treatment.....Best of luck to you !",

Have you had a long talk with a Radiation Oncologist?? If surgery only gives you a 50% chance of a cure, why mess with it? Demand your surgeon talk straight with you..You DO have other options...Brachytherapy (seeds) combined with IGRT is an option you should consider...Gleason 9 means you are in a fight for your life and you have to get it right the first time...Do your homework... Having said that, I will also say this: By removing (surgery) the cancerous prostate gland, you will be removing a large, perhaps 100%, of the cancer in your body. You will have a complete pathology of the gland. Any necessary followup treatment will be dealing with a greatly reduced tumor burden as the main tumor is GONE...There are lots of things to consider....",

      "Content": "Just a few years ago, there were only 4 or 5 Proton Machines in the country and they were not used for prostate cancer salvage treatments. The facilities that owned these machines started promoting them (you witnessed some of that) as being suitable for a much wider range of cancer treatment in order to keep the machines busy in order to defray the extremely high cost of building one.. Recently, many more large hospitals and treatment centers have jumped on the bandwagon and \"invested\" in a Proton treatment machine. These Cyclotrons cost over $150 million to build....So keeping them busy 12 to 18 hours a day is important..The advantage in using one of these machines for prostate cancer salvage radiation has yet to be demonstrated. The latest generation of LIMACS, Linear Accelerators, the machines that administer IGRT and IMRT are MUCH improved over those in use just a few years ago so the radiation horror stories are not heard much anymore..They are more suitable in administering radiation over a wider area (prostate bed) than the \"pencil beam\" proton machines are... You need to be careful when navigating in these waters as SERIOUS money is on the table here. $130,000 for IMRT and $200K and up for a series of proton treatments..Do your homework...",

Very, very few of us can travel around the country visiting with world renowned doctors and institutions before we make our treatment decisions..We find out what our insurance will pay for, who is on the approved list, do a little research and choose a local surgeon or oncologist to treat us..Even a Cow Town like Denver where I live offers some truly outstanding treatment choices...They may not publish books or research papers but they get the job done... In your first post, you used the term \"Successful Surgery\" when you are 2 weeks post surgery..And with your G-6 cancer, you like 90% of the men with similar numbers as yours enjoy \"Successful Surgery\", their PC cured never to return..There are three key milestones you must pass first..The 8 week PSA test comes back undetectable, the two year test comes back the same way as does the five year test....THEN you can break out the Champagne and we will all drink a rousing toast to your good fortune..But until then, sure, ride along with us and help the new guys, terrified and afraid, unsure what awaits them on this unsure journey...",

The newest equipment no longer needs the markers to accurately aim the beam....Also, today, brachytherapy, seeds, have made big improvements especially when combined with beam radiation. The two used in conjunction can deliver the highest overall dose while maintaining lower side-effect risk..If your RO is shy about Brachytherapy, it's probably because he does not perform the procedure..I would locate and consult with an RO who does perform it AND IS EXPERT AT IT.... One more thing to investigate..Radiation treatment is very expensive. Always get preapprovals from your insurance company. Find out what your payment responsibility will be before you agree to any treatment.....Best of luck to you !",

So now, with the entire gland biopsied, was there any more aggressive cancer found? G-8 or G-9? Or did the original G-7 hold up? Did the pathologist find any positive margins in the tissue sample delivered to him? I hate to say this, but when all 12 biopsy cores are positive, it's very difficult for a surgeon to achieve clean margins....But it is possible so lets hope that's the case !!

      "Content": "NJS, your posts carry much useful information for the new guys..A wake-up call as to how important having an expert surgeon is..I hope everyone takes the time to read your entire series of posts and look up what \"PSM rate\" means... Surgeons who limit (or try to limit) there practices to G6 and low-risk G7 patients while turning away G8, 9 & 10 patients are certain to have fewer Positive Surgical Margins than surgeons who are willing to take a shot at curing those in the high-risk group....So by cherry-picking the customer base they can make themselves look very good indeed..Being a G9, my surgeon let me know my chances for success (surgical cure) were only 50-50 and that I would probably need follow-up radiation..But I figured 50-50 was better than nothing so I opted for the surgery (after doing a considerable amount of research). As it has turned out, my surgeon was correct and I messed up his PSM rate a little...",

      "Content": "Scan technology is advancing very rapidly..The one used to check prostates is called mpMRI and it's being used to avoid multiple biopsies on guys doing AS..Once you have had 2 or 3 annual biopsies as part of your AS check-ups it is now felt that a mpMRI can replace more biopsies as long as the PSA remains reasonably stable...But the mpMRI is NOT accurate enough to replace biopsies completely, especially the first 2 or 3 ...To answer your question, yes, there is a 30% chance if you have only had one biopsy..But as the number of repeat biopsies grows, that 30% figure diminishes rapidly..The more biopsies you have, the more confident your doctors become that there is no higher grade cancer lurking. Some guys REALLY hate biopsies (you can't blame them) and they want to depend 100% on the mpMRI to spot any high-grade tumors...Because of that 30% figure, that is a high risk option.....",

      "Content": "Here is how I see it..In most countries, if all prostate cancers are detected and treated, the costs of providing this treatment soon get out of hand..By withholding PSA testing, a huge cost savings is realized... They justify this by saying: \"Even if millions of prostate cancers are allowed to run their course undetected and untreated, the overall mortality rate of males, statistically, does not change at all. Overall, it makes no difference in males lifespans whether these cancers are detected and treated or not detected and treated....\" My reply is, well, it may not make any difference to the male population as a whole, but as an individual who is but a tiny, insignificant part of that population, PSA testing can make a HUGE difference in how long you live and in how well you live...If cost control is a must, that can be accomplished without denial of service..",

The insurance companies won't pay for any of this stuff unless it's done in the proper order..Each step in the process justifies the next step..First, comes the biopsy..If it's negative, you will be told to come back in 6 months for another PSA test and DRE.. If it's positive, then some more extensive scans can be justified and prescribed..You did not mention your PSA level, but if it's under 10 or 15, metastasis to your neck glands is unlikely..if it's under 10, the scans are unlikely to show anything at all..Most Urologists will try a run of antibiotics before they perform a biopsy just to see how the PSA responds to that... The waiting is the worst part, try to put it on the back burner and not worry about it..Best of luck to you..",

This may be your only chance! You want a large \"overnight\" bag and a strap-on leg bag for moving around..A couple of velcro straps to secure the catheter up high on your thigh and the bag (leg bag) those extra straps are important..You don't want the catheter supported by your Johnson..You want a strap for that... A pair of baggy \"sweat pants\" to go home in..Elastic waist, no belt.. You will meet your anesthesiologist just before the surgery..Ask him to be careful of your vocal cords when he inserts the breathing tube..I talked like Donald Duck for two weeks.. Your appetite may be lacking for a while..",

But at 52, the side-effects of radiation have a lot of time to manifest themselves and can be VERY hard to treat... It's a tough choice and we all have to face it and deal with it. Here is a good book, up to date..Gerald Chodaks's \"Winning the battle against prostate cancer\"...Dr. Partick Walsh's book, a few years older but he covers everything in fine detail..\"Guide to surviving prostate cancer..\" The information in these books will give you a good foundation to base your decisions on...",

Be sure the RO you choose has plenty of experience with prostate patients and has access to the latest equipment (LINACS) used to administer the radiation treatment.. If you have not yet consulted with a Medical Oncologist now might be a good time to do so, even if your urologist / surgeon disagrees. Ask HIM (the MO) who might be the best R.O. around...Don't be surprised if these actions puts you into a certain degree of conflict with the urologist surgeon as these three specialists compete with each other for patients...A good Urologist will welcome your desire to seek other opinions...",

      "Content": "HHhhmmmmm.. It seems to me they are trying to do two things at once....Narrow the radiation beam a little to limit unwanted tissue and organ damage. And shorten the ADT time to reduce the unpleasant side-effects...But since they are doing two things at once, how do they tell which treatment change produced the favorable or unfavorable result ?? If the trial fails, do they blame it on the radiation part or the ADT part? Another consideration, these trials are usually performed free to the patient..So depending on your health insurance, there may be a huge difference in your overall expense for being treated...Personally, I don't think there will be a big difference in the outcomes between the standard treatment and the trial treatment..One thing we all have learned here, every case is different so it's very hard to accurately predict outcomes...",

      "Content": "John's advise was excellent as usual...One SLOW DOWN...With Gleason 6, there is no hurry. Pick up a copy of Patrick Walsh's book (Guide to surviving prostate cancer, 3rd edition) and read it. With surgery, it all depends on the skill of the surgeon (and luck) as to the results achieved and side-effects endured. Same with radiation, really...Today, many Radiation Oncologists are combining seed implants along with beam radiation, a one-two punch that is VERY effective. Some doctors are adding Hormone Therapy to the radiation and getting even better results... So you have lots of options to sort out. Surgery might be one of them but don't rush into it before you have a complete understanding about what is going on. Read the book I recommended to get a solid background about what your are facing before you make a treatment decision..Be warned, the doctors will all push the product they are selling... I have used alldaychemist for various drugs including Cialis without any problems. But others have had problems. You might want to pay using a pre-paid, disposable credit card..Most of the problems occurred earlier before they switched to secure servers.. There is always a chance that Customs will seize your order..If that happens, ADC will usually replace the \"lost\" shipment..",

The Radiation Oncologists will tell you since the surgery is likely to fail, why even bother with it.. Why expose yourself to the complications and side-effects of surgery? The surgeons will reply \"PC is a lot easier for radiation to cure if we remove 98% of it first..Some experts agree with that, some don't.. I'm a G-9 and I have had the Full Monty, surgery, hormones, radiation..My surgery had complications, major infection, back in the hospital for a week. I'm now 2 years past diagnosis, PSA undetectable, (cancer free) and impotent. I'm 100% continent. No treatment at present time...

      "Content": "First, you should know that very few men ever die from Gleason 6 prostate cancer..That grade of tumor very seldom if ever metastasizes and spreads to other organs or bones. BUT, you can never be sure, from a 12 core biopsy, that all of your cancer is Gleason 6. The biopsy performed after a prostatectomy when the entire organ is examined 30% of the time will be upgraded to a higher Gleason score. Your biopsy, with cancer found in 8 of the 12 cores points to fairly extensive (but low risk) cancer. You have probably had it for quite a while...So waiting another 6 months before treatment is not that big a deal but it does add to the risks involved... Having a consultation with a Medical Oncologist (ask your primary care physician for a referral) can be enlightening. They work with both surgeons (Urologists) and Radiation Oncologists and they have seen it all. Their insights can be very helpful..... Urologists can also be surgeons. Radiation Oncologists are a different specialty. They frequently work with Urologists, sometimes in the same treatment center. Medical Oncologists take over when the other two have failed to provide a cure.. While Hormone Therapy is very effective at suppressing prostate cancer, it comes with a heavy side-effect load...Many doctors will shy away from it except as a last resort because of quality of life issues..It also makes treatment more difficult because it masks whether the primary (curative) treatment is working or not... How dangerous is your cancer? That's hard to say without more information..Have you had previous PSA tests before the 5.6 one? If so what are those numbers and when were they done? PSA velocity is important. As a general rule, the quicker your PSA rises, the more aggressive your cancer...Have you read Dr. Walsh's book? It's the best money you will ever spend...",

Had he had clean margins and a recurrence, then the cancer could be anywhere and much more difficult to treat..Nothing (yet) knocks out distant mets permanently. Once PC has metastasized, you are just fighting for as much time as possible...The purpose of Adjunct HT combined with RT is because several good studies have shown that the addition of HT increases the effectiveness of the RT by a considerable amount...The argument against it is the quality of life loss (from the HT) is not worth the benefit it provides.

      "Content": "\"A higher voltage of electroporation was found in pigs to irreversibly destroy target cells within a narrow range while leaving neighboring cells unaffected, and thus represents a promising new treatment for cancer, heart disease and other disease states that require removal of tissue.[5] Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has since proven effective in treating human cancer, with surgeons at Johns Hopkins and other institutions now using the technology to treat pancreatic cancer previously thought to be unresectable.[6] A recent technique called non-thermal irreversible electroporation (N-TIRE) has proven successful in treating many different types of tumors and other unwanted tissue. This procedure is done using small electrodes (about 1mm in diameter), placed either inside or surrounding the target tissue to apply short, repetitive bursts of electricity at a predetermined voltage and frequency. These bursts of electricity increase the resting transmembrane potential (TMP), so that nanopores form in the plasma membrane. When the electricity applied to the tissue is above the electric field threshold of the target tissue, the cells become permanently permeable from the formation of nanopores. As a result, the cells are unable to repair the damage and die due to a loss of homeostasis.[7] N-TIRE is unique to other tumor ablation techniques in that it does not create thermal damage to the tissue around it.\"................WIKIpedia",

ARMOR3-SV is the first pivotal trial in prostate cancer to employ a precision medicine approach for patient selection. We are focusing our late-stage development of galeterone on AR-V7 positive metastatic CRPC patients because it represents an unmet need in prostate cancer and an efficient development path for galeterone.

      "Content": "It IS possible to have a very high PSA number and not have prostate cancer..My urologist has two patients with PSA readings in the hundreds, multiple biopsies including saturation biopsies and no cancer found. So it IS possible..But their prostates are much larger than 70cc...In most cases with a PSA that high, the cause is prostate cancer. In it's early stages it causes no symptoms. You will just have to sweat it out until all the tests come back. There will be a bone scan, some X-rays, maybe a MRI and CAT scan. These tests will look for signs that the cancer may have spread beyond the prostate. The results of the biopsy, the Gleason score it reveals, and the results of the other tests I mentioned will allow his doctors to recommend a treatment program that will be the most effective for him...Do not jump to conclusions that this is a death sentence. It is not. This cancer is very treatable, generally slow-growing, most men live with it for many years..

You can put together a \"signature\" , brief case history of your journey that will be included in your posts. How to do this is spelled out in one of the \"stickies\" at the beginning of the forum.. Back to your question, if surgery has failed to cure you, then the Urologists job is pretty much done...Visit with a Medical Oncologist if you wish to continue fighting your cancer....He has the expertise to extend your life as long as possible....If possible, find an oncologist who specializes in prostate cancer or has much experience treating it...",

However, some recent trials have shown that when Zytiga is substituted for Casodex during salvage radiation treatment, the cure rate improves. This fact is probably how your RO got the drug approved...Good for you and Good Luck !",

I started drinking pomegranate juice and just ordered several antioxidants (Lycopene and Resveratrol Defense + Vitamin C). I also increased my Omega-3 fish oil to 1000 mg daily. My urologist isn't into supplements and I just want to do everything I can to slow the cancer down before radiation is recommended. Let me know your views and anything else I might try. Thanks. \" It was the OP who brought the subject up.. I agree with Mikla that dropping the US-PSA test would be a good first step in relieving his anxiety..Doing full pelvic radiation with any cancers actual location based on guesswork is not very effective treatment IMHO......With the standard PSA test, the need for further treatment will be known soon enough and at this point it might be possible to localize the location of the problem and focus treatment on that area....In the OP's case, a very localized G-6 cancer removed with 100% clean margins, perhaps moving on to SRT sooner rather than later is justified as any cancer is probably located in the pelvic area..",

      "Content": "Most journeys have a beginning, a middle part and an end...I'm writing this down while I still can remember the details with some degree of accuracy...At age 55, my health insurance family plan (I was self employed), always expensive, doubled in price, making it unaffordable for my wife and I to maintain. That was 20 years ago....I had a complete physical as a precaution before I canceled the insurance, everything was fine but my doctor voiced some concern over my PSA number which was 3.5, something like that..The DRE was fine....So over the next 9 years I did get the occasional PSA test, usually at a free screening or health fair...The number went up very slowly, not enough to trigger any concern. Then, at age 64.5, at another free prostate cancer screening the Uro listed my DRE as \"abnormal\" and the PSA came back 6.8.. He said I should \"see my doctor\" about further investigation..I had spent a lot of time investigating what form of Medicare to choose, so many choices, finally I chose one recommended by my family doctor, a Medicare Advantage Plan run by United Health care and accepted by my family doctor..The day my membership card arrived I made an appointment to see him, he referred me to a Urology clinic where they quickly scheduled me for a biopsy. It came back negative ! I was off the hook ! But the urologist cautioned me, something is going on, we need to watch it. I also had a mild case of BPE so he put me on Finasteride which, as expected, lowered my PSA by half, down to 4.5 or so. A year went by, PSA started moving up a little, another biopsy, again no cancer but there was some high-grade PIN..Nine more months pass, more concern, the Uro wanted a third biopsy, I resisted but finally agreed, this time he really was aggressive with the wand and the results came back positive in 4 cores, two were G-6, one G-7 and one G-9... This was nine years ago, going on ten....Back then, in Denver, I had 2 choices, surgery or radiation..One of the partners at the Urology clinic was a top notch surgeon with a good reputation who actually taught other urologists how to perform the surgery using the then fairly new da Vinci surgical robot . He tried to talk me out of having surgery, saying that G-9 cases like mine could only expect a 50-50 chance of a cure. At that time radiation offered about the same odds.. I chose surgery anyway, 50% being better than nothing and I always could fall back on radiation if necessary...The actual surgery went well, although it resulted in a nasty staph infection that put me back in the hospital for a week, then a month of IV antibiotics at home..First post surgery PSA came back 0.9 Ouch ! Nine months passed while I healed/ recovered from the surgery while I searched for the best R.O. I could find. I found one who was the director of radiology at a big local hospital that had just installed the latest Varian LINAC Rapid Arc I did 40 fractions SRT + ADT He wanted 2 years ADT but after 18 months of undetectable PSA checks he relented and my active treatment ended. Two more years went by with undetectable PSA tests, things were looking good.....Then the monster came back....Back on ADT, Lupron only, PSA went undetectable again for almost 2 years. When PSA again was detected, Casodex was added, and PSA again dropped to undetectable.. A single bone met was found in a neck vertebra, my R.O. gave it 5 shots of SBRT and it disappeared..PSA back to undetectable (all PSA's using the standard assay). About a year later, PSA returned and Zytiga replaced the Casodex. At this point I was no longer seeing any urologists, relying on a young, aggressive M.O. instead. I had a nice remission with the Zytiga, almost two years undetectable or at least less than 1.0.. Late last year the Zytiga stopped working, switched to Xtandi, got a fair but short-lived response. PSA moving up rapidly now..It was 54 two weeks ago... Two years ago, I was seen by a VA oncologist. I needed to do this in order to have the VA supply the Zytiga and Xtandi which even with Part D Medicare I could not afford those co-pays and doughnut holes..I got to like and trust the VA doctor. Both my Medicare oncologist and my VA oncologist agree chemo (Docetaxel) is my next step. Since Quality of Life takes a huge step backwards with this, I have been resisting implementing it, hoping one of the new immunotherapy treatments became available. Yes, I know about Provenge but it's not available through the VA and my Medicare doctor has little faith in it, especially considering its cost. It's very hard to walk into the Chemo Lounge when you have no symptoms and let them push a bag of poison into your veins knowing it will make you sick as hell.. So that's pretty much my journey so far..I just thought I would share it with everyone..I have learned so much from the guys who are on the same journey, thank you all.... Fairwind...",

      "Content": "Gleason 9 prostate cancer is a 50-50 bet when it comes to using the word \"cure\"..Your partner's biopsy results showed that a cure was highly unlikely, the cancer was just too far along..The surgery was in fact a debulking procedure which is worthwhile but was unlikely to be curative.. In the States, if the person had adequate insurance, an aggressive treatment would be mounted aimed at preventing or slowing metastasis to the bones..While castration is still the most effective hormone treatment, chemical castration in the form of ADT-3 is widely used to extend the survival time as long as possible..ADT-3 uses three drugs to achieve the same result as surgical castration..Lupron, Casodex and Finasteride are typically used.. Dr. Patrick Walsh's book, \"Guide to surviving prostate cancer\" will provide both you and your partner with the necessary knowledge to help you guide your doctors into providing the treatment that's best for you..The later chapters in the book deal with how advanced prostate is treated..",

      "Content": "The Book is \"Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Dr. Pat Walsh.. They may want to do a bone scan and a full-body MRI to see if any metastasis (spread) shows up. Just a CYA procedure in your case...Then you will have to decide what form of treatment you will undergo..Assuming you have decent medical insurance, your choices will be surgery to remove your prostate and hopefully all the cancer, resulting in a cure..Or radiation..Works as well as surgery but is more expensive, takes longer and has a different side-effect profile. There are other types of radiation, Brachytherapy or \"seeds\". Fast and effective. Radiation seems to be even more effective when used in conjunction with \"Hormone Therapy\", which comes with major side-effects..If you start with surgery and it fails to deliver a cure, you can move on to \"Salvage Radiation\" and see if that works for you..But if you begin with radiation, surgery generally can't be used as a backup..Your Urologist may or may not want to perform the surgery himself. Most urologists are also surgeons. But you want an EXPERT surgeon, so do a little research before you commit to a surgeon or Radiation Oncologist..Today, 80% of the Prostatectomies are performed with a DaVinci Surgical Robot..But there are those who feel the old \"open\" technique produces better results..Again, do your homework.. When you get done with Walsh's book, you might want to read Dr. Gerald Chodaks, \"Winning the battle against prostate cancer\". He concentrates on ALL the treatment options, their effectiveness, side-effects, in a completely unbiased way.. With a PSA under 6 and only 2 cores malignant, you cancer sounds to be very curable..But PC is tricky..No two men respond exactly the same..Outcomes can be very hard to predict...One benefit with surgery, the entire gland is removed and can be biopsied in detail..Then you know for sure just how dangerous your cancer was or was not...Best of luck to you!",

      "Content": "Our cases are similar...All (3) of my doctors prefer the standard test. For the reasons your Uro-surgeon mentioned..If your standard test comes back <0.1 (undetectable) that means you are cured or at least in remission. Enjoy that state of being and move away from worrying about PC until you have something to worry about...The ultra-sensitive test may indeed show something...Oh My God, what am I going to do now??? Months of useless, needless worry, THAT'S all you get with the ultra-sensitive test...Instead of enjoying life, you spend 24 hours a day worrying about when you should get yet another test.. The chances of any further treatment starting before the PSA level climbs above 0.2 are very slim..So watching it slowly (or quickly) move to that level just robs your good time and sends you spinning into the black hole of PSA anxiety..Take \"undetectable\" for what it is and enjoy it for as long as you can... I don't blame you for wanting to get off HT as quickly as possible, but 6 months may not be as effective as a year or 18 months..If you think your testosterone is going to come roaring back in a couple of weeks, that's not how it works..It will take two or three months before it returns to normal levels..So you might as well do 6 more months and get maximum benefit from it..",

One point to consider...The needle biopsy found some cancer in your prostate gland...But needle biopsies can not be counted on to have discovered ALL the cancer that may be present..Prostate cancer tends to be multi-focal, there is usually more than one tumor developing at any given time....While your biopsy points to a very early stage there is a 30% chance of more advanced disease..Further testing can narrow this down before you submit to a radical prostatectomy.. No one has yet mentioned the the need for a second opinion on your biopsy slides...Most of the time, the findings are strong enough so this step is not necessary but when a small amount of Gleason 6 is the basis for a cancer diagnosis, you want to be SURE the pathology report is accurate because you and your doctors will be basing your treatment on what the biopsy revealed. So it's very important these findings are correct..There are two \"expert\" pathology labs that specialize in analyzing prostate biopsies. Epstien at Johns-Hopkins and Bostwick Labs. Ask your urologist to arrange for the second opinion at one of these labs...",

      "Content": "Not all surgeons are created equal...If you choose surgery, and can get your insurance company to agree, I would seek out a recognized expert to perform the surgery..This is easier said than done..Another form of radiation treatment, Brachytherapy, and brachy combined with external beam can deliver results equal or better than surgery with less side-effect risk..Again, seek out the best doctors you can find and can afford... One other thing to consider..Your G-6 biopsy puts you in low risk, few men ever die from this category..But unless the prostate is removed and the entire gland biopsied, you can't be SURE there is not some higher grade cancer lurking..It is not unusual for pathology reports to be changed to a more threatening form of PC when the organ is removed and examined closely. With radiation, you have to take that needle biopsy at face value and hope for the best and the majority of the time, that's fine... Winning the battle against prostate cancer by Dr. G. Chodak is an up to date book that explains all the treatment options and favors none. Just the facts.....Dr. Walsh's book is more detailed but he is a surgeon so it slants that way a little...Making this decision is the toughest part. Best of luck to you.",

      "Content": "Not all surgeons are created equal...If you choose surgery, and can get your insurance company to agree, I would seek out a recognized expert to perform the surgery..This is easier said than done..Another form of radiation treatment, Brachytherapy, and brachy combined with external beam can deliver results equal or better than surgery with less side-effect risk..Again, seek out the best doctors you can find and can afford... One other thing to consider..Your G-6 biopsy puts you in low risk, few men ever die from this category..But unless the prostate is removed and the entire gland biopsied, you can't be SURE there is not some higher grade cancer lurking..It is not unusual for pathology reports to be changed to a more threatening form of PC when the organ is removed and examined closely. With radiation, you have to take that needle biopsy at face value and hope for the best and the majority of the time, that's fine... Winning the battle against prostate cancer by Dr. G. Chodak is an up to date book that explains all the treatment options and favors none. Just the facts.....Dr. Walsh's book is more detailed but he is a surgeon so it slants that way a little...Making this decision is the toughest part. Best of luck to you.",

Alas, my PSA also moved off the undetectable peg also so I'm back on HT..But figure 3 or 4 months after the shot wears off before your \"T\" will recover..You should check your \"T\" level along with your PSA...The longer you were on HT, the longer it takes to recover..After 3 years, few men ever recover, the effect becomes permanent.. Since you have had radiation treatment, you need to be careful with anything that can lead to bleeding, aspirin, fish oil..A condition called \"Radiation Cystitis\" is common and may be aggravated by aspirin..Symptoms include blood in your urine, hematuria...I would talk with my RO & Uro both about doing an aspirin regimen..",

      "Content": "Radiation \"works\" by damaging the DNA in the cancer cells so they can't reproduce..It does not kill all the cancer cells instantly. So PSA seldom plummets after R/T. Rather, there is a slow, steady decline to \"nadir\", some low point that remains stable for years...When R/T is used as a primary treatment, the prostate gland is still able to produce some small amount of PSA and this is what shows up on subsequent PSA tests. If it's used as salvage (trying to salvage a failed surgery) the prostate gland has (hopefully) been completely removed so there is no source of residual PSA..In other words, PSA should drop to zero or very near zero and stay there..When HT is added as an adjunct to radiation, PSA usually drops to a very low number very quickly and will stay there as long as the HT continues. This effect masks whether or not the R/T was effective..You don't really know until you are taken off the HT and the results of the radiation must then stand on their own..... One way to judge whether radiation worked or not, PSA should never rise above what it was before treatment started....If it does, the cancer is still active and further treatment may be necessary....",

Researchers are not exactly sure what the mechanism is, but it is felt that the HT weakens the cancer cells and makes them more susceptible to the radiation, improving results..

They should know that when radiation is the primary treatment, some residual PSA is quite normal as you still have a prostate gland... I would certainly get a second opinion on the appropriateness of going back on HT at this time..It is my understanding that it takes at least 2 years for PSA to stabilize after radiation treatment...This fact might have something to do with why the insurance company balked at re-starting the HT...Again, get a second opinion from a Radiation Oncologist.....",

You paid for it, It's yours..Your Urologist should have no qualms about giving you a copy.

This is repeated 12 times, taking 12 sample cores.

      "Content": "KLA, before we can offer advise and help, you need to clarify your Gleason score.. Gleason 5 (3+2=5 or 2+3=5) is seldom if ever reported as being positive for cancer. Few if any urologists would recommend surgery...But if ONE of the grades in your Gleason score is a 5, (4+5=9) then that is serious. You can get a copy of your biopsy report from your doctor simply by asking for one. If you have indeed tested positive for PC, now would be a good time to read \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Patrick Walsh. Try and get the newest (third) edition..",

Some guys REALLY hate biopsies (you can't blame them) and they want to depend 100% on the mpMRI to spot any high-grade tumors...Because of that 30% figure, that is a high risk option.....",

Had he had clean margins and a recurrence, then the cancer could be anywhere and much more difficult to treat..Nothing (yet) knocks out distant mets permanently. Once PC has metastasized, you are just fighting for as much time as possible...The purpose of Adjunct HT combined with RT is because several good studies have shown that the addition of HT increases the effectiveness of the RT by a considerable amount...The argument against it is the quality of life loss (from the HT) is not worth the benefit it provides.

      "Content": "You may indeed be able to obtain insurance sooner than your 65th birthday under Obamacare . When you turn 65, the provisions of your policy may change as Medicare takes over.. $2000 for your TRUP biopsy sounds about double what it should have been..In my case, 4 years ago, the total charge covered by Medicare and accepted by my Urologist was $750..Plus my $30 copay..So $780. The pathology labs bill was paid by Medicare and I never saw it..I believe the split was $400 for the Urologist services and $350 for the lab that performed the pathology. In my case, the pathologist was an employee of the lab and he did not bill separately. Today, many medical specialists like Pathologists, Urologists, Radiation Oncologists, Medical Oncologists et.al. refuse to become \"employees\" of hospitals or large treatment centers where they are expected to work for a fixed salary. Instead they become \"private contractors\", self-employed free-lancers that can charge whatever they want for their services. Many of these people will refuse Medicare patients period. Some are willing to accept Medicare Advantage patients because their insurance is administered by private insurance companies that pay quicker and in some cases pay more than regular Medicare does....Since your biopsy was not covered by insurance, there was no one involved who could bundle the various charges and submit them for insurance payment so you wound up taking the full hit... Most medical practices have a \"Billing Clerk\" as part of their staff, a trained and well-paid person who knows all the ins and outs of medical billing. This person can help you determine who is going to pay for what and how much..Before I was to undergo a major medical procedure, I always asked for \"pre-approval\" so there were no surprises..",

      "Content": "\"A higher voltage of electroporation was found in pigs to irreversibly destroy target cells within a narrow range while leaving neighboring cells unaffected, and thus represents a promising new treatment for cancer, heart disease and other disease states that require removal of tissue.[5] Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has since proven effective in treating human cancer, with surgeons at Johns Hopkins and other institutions now using the technology to treat pancreatic cancer previously thought to be unresectable.[6] A recent technique called non-thermal irreversible electroporation (N-TIRE) has proven successful in treating many different types of tumors and other unwanted tissue. This procedure is done using small electrodes (about 1mm in diameter), placed either inside or surrounding the target tissue to apply short, repetitive bursts of electricity at a predetermined voltage and frequency. These bursts of electricity increase the resting transmembrane potential (TMP), so that nanopores form in the plasma membrane. When the electricity applied to the tissue is above the electric field threshold of the target tissue, the cells become permanently permeable from the formation of nanopores. As a result, the cells are unable to repair the damage and die due to a loss of homeostasis.[7] N-TIRE is unique to other tumor ablation techniques in that it does not create thermal damage to the tissue around it.\"................WIKIpedia",

That's why PSA screening every year or two is so important, so you find it at the very beginning when it's much more treatable..Every male should get a PSA test at the age of 45 or 50 to establish a base line, a reading that is \"normal\" for him. Then as the years go by, a PSA velocity can be established, the rate at which the level is increasing. This way, any suspicious changes are very easy to spot before things get out of hand..",

      "Content": "It IS possible to have a very high PSA number and not have prostate cancer..My urologist has two patients with PSA readings in the hundreds, multiple biopsies including saturation biopsies and no cancer found. So it IS possible..But their prostates are much larger than 70cc...In most cases with a PSA that high, the cause is prostate cancer. In it's early stages it causes no symptoms. You will just have to sweat it out until all the tests come back. There will be a bone scan, some X-rays, maybe a MRI and CAT scan. These tests will look for signs that the cancer may have spread beyond the prostate. The results of the biopsy, the Gleason score it reveals, and the results of the other tests I mentioned will allow his doctors to recommend a treatment program that will be the most effective for him...Do not jump to conclusions that this is a death sentence. It is not. This cancer is very treatable, generally slow-growing, most men live with it for many years.. A good book on the subject is \"Guide to surviving prostate cancer\" by Dr. Patrick Walsh..Any library or book store or eBay/Amazon..",

      "Content": "Here is how I see it..In most countries, if all prostate cancers are detected and treated, the costs of providing this treatment soon get out of hand..By withholding PSA testing, a huge cost savings is realized... They justify this by saying: \"Even if millions of prostate cancers are allowed to run their course undetected and untreated, the overall mortality rate of males, statistically, does not change at all. Overall, it makes no difference in males lifespans whether these cancers are detected and treated or not detected and treated....\" My reply is, well, it may not make any difference to the male population as a whole, but as an individual who is but a tiny, insignificant part of that population, PSA testing can make a HUGE difference in how long you live and in how well you live...If cost control is a must, that can be accomplished without denial of service..",

That's why PSA screening every year or two is so important, so you find it at the very beginning when it's much more treatable..Every male should get a PSA test at the age of 45 or 50 to establish a base line, a reading that is \"normal\" for him. Then as the years go by, a PSA velocity can be established, the rate at which the level is increasing. This way, any suspicious changes are very easy to spot before things get out of hand..",

      "Content": "It IS possible to have a very high PSA number and not have prostate cancer..My urologist has two patients with PSA readings in the hundreds, multiple biopsies including saturation biopsies and no cancer found. So it IS possible..But their prostates are much larger than 70cc...In most cases with a PSA that high, the cause is prostate cancer. In it's early stages it causes no symptoms. You will just have to sweat it out until all the tests come back. There will be a bone scan, some X-rays, maybe a MRI and CAT scan. These tests will look for signs that the cancer may have spread beyond the prostate. The results of the biopsy, the Gleason score it reveals, and the results of the other tests I mentioned will allow his doctors to recommend a treatment program that will be the most effective for him...Do not jump to conclusions that this is a death sentence. It is not. This cancer is very treatable, generally slow-growing, most men live with it for many years.. A good book on the subject is \"Guide to surviving prostate cancer\" by Dr. Patrick Walsh..Any library or book store or eBay/Amazon..",

With radiation, the side effects tend to come on slowly several years after treatment..Regardless of what form of treatment you choose, find the best doctors you can to carry it out..Their skills can vary considerably.. You might consult with a Medical Oncologist..They have seen it all and they know who the good guys are. Their opinions can be VERY helpful...",

      "Content": "One, you have plenty of time to consider ALL your options..Don't let anyone rush you into anything... One point to consider...The needle biopsy found some cancer in your prostate gland...But needle biopsies can not be counted on to have discovered ALL the cancer that may be present..Prostate cancer tends to be multi-focal, there is usually more than one tumor developing at any given time....While your biopsy points to a very early stage there is a 30% chance of more advanced disease..Further testing can narrow this down before you submit to a radical prostatectomy.. No one has yet mentioned the the need for a second opinion on your biopsy slides...Most of the time, the findings are strong enough so this step is not necessary but when a small amount of Gleason 6 is the basis for a cancer diagnosis, you want to be SURE the pathology report is accurate because you and your doctors will be basing your treatment on what the biopsy revealed. So it's very important these findings are correct..There are two \"expert\" pathology labs that specialize in analyzing prostate biopsies. Epstien at Johns-Hopkins and Bostwick Labs. Ask your urologist to arrange for the second opinion at one of these labs...",

      "Content": "\" I'm not there yet, but is there anything I can be doing to slow down the PSA doubling time? I started drinking pomegranate juice and just ordered several antioxidants (Lycopene and Resveratrol Defense + Vitamin C). I also increased my Omega-3 fish oil to 1000 mg daily. My urologist isn't into supplements and I just want to do everything I can to slow the cancer down before radiation is recommended. Let me know your views and anything else I might try. Thanks. \" It was the OP who brought the subject up.. I agree with Mikla that dropping the US-PSA test would be a good first step in relieving his anxiety..Doing full pelvic radiation with any cancers actual location based on guesswork is not very effective treatment IMHO......With the standard PSA test, the need for further treatment will be known soon enough and at this point it might be possible to localize the location of the problem and focus treatment on that area....In the OP's case, a very localized G-6 cancer removed with 100% clean margins, perhaps moving on to SRT sooner rather than later is justified as any cancer is probably located in the pelvic area..",

The thinking is that even after you become refractory, the cancer progressing, it will progress much slower if ADT is maintained..Besides, administering ADT is a profit center for the Docs..When you become refractory, they may try one of the newer drugs, Xtandi or Zytiga, which can produce a nice remission even at this late stage...Now, they are doing chemo first (instead of last) after trials have shown chemo is more effective if used earlier..Sadly, even with all this, there is no cure once the horse leaves the barn...",

      "Content": "Most journeys have a beginning, a middle part and an end...I'm writing this down while I still can remember the details with some degree of accuracy...At age 55, my health insurance family plan (I was self employed), always expensive, doubled in price, making it unaffordable for my wife and I to maintain. That was 20 years ago....I had a complete physical as a precaution before I canceled the insurance, everything was fine but my doctor voiced some concern over my PSA number which was 3.5, something like that..The DRE was fine....So over the next 9 years I did get the occasional PSA test, usually at a free screening or health fair...The number went up very slowly, not enough to trigger any concern. Then, at age 64.5, at another free prostate cancer screening the Uro listed my DRE as \"abnormal\" and the PSA came back 6.8.. He said I should \"see my doctor\" about further investigation..I had spent a lot of time investigating what form of Medicare to choose, so many choices, finally I chose one recommended by my family doctor, a Medicare Advantage Plan run by United Health care and accepted by my family doctor..The day my membership card arrived I made an appointment to see him, he referred me to a Urology clinic where they quickly scheduled me for a biopsy. It came back negative ! I was off the hook ! But the urologist cautioned me, something is going on, we need to watch it. I also had a mild case of BPE so he put me on Finasteride which, as expected, lowered my PSA by half, down to 4.5 or so. A year went by, PSA started moving up a little, another biopsy, again no cancer but there was some high-grade PIN..Nine more months pass, more concern, the Uro wanted a third biopsy, I resisted but finally agreed, this time he really was aggressive with the wand and the results came back positive in 4 cores, two were G-6, one G-7 and one G-9... This was nine years ago, going on ten....Back then, in Denver, I had 2 choices, surgery or radiation..One of the partners at the Urology clinic was a top notch surgeon with a good reputation who actually taught other urologists how to perform the surgery using the then fairly new da Vinci surgical robot . He tried to talk me out of having surgery, saying that G-9 cases like mine could only expect a 50-50 chance of a cure. At that time radiation offered about the same odds.. I chose surgery anyway, 50% being better than nothing and I always could fall back on radiation if necessary...The actual surgery went well, although it resulted in a nasty staph infection that put me back in the hospital for a week, then a month of IV antibiotics at home..First post surgery PSA came back 0.9 Ouch ! Nine months passed while I healed/ recovered from the surgery while I searched for the best R.O. I could find. I found one who was the director of radiology at a big local hospital that had just installed the latest Varian LINAC Rapid Arc I did 40 fractions SRT + ADT He wanted 2 years ADT but after 18 months of undetectable PSA checks he relented and my active treatment ended. Two more years went by with undetectable PSA tests, things were looking good.....Then the monster came back....Back on ADT, Lupron only, PSA went undetectable again for almost 2 years. When PSA again was detected, Casodex was added, and PSA again dropped to undetectable.. A single bone met was found in a neck vertebra, my R.O. gave it 5 shots of SBRT and it disappeared..PSA back to undetectable (all PSA's using the standard assay). About a year later, PSA returned and Zytiga replaced the Casodex. At this point I was no longer seeing any urologists, relying on a young, aggressive M.O. instead. I had a nice remission with the Zytiga, almost two years undetectable or at least less than 1.0.. Late last year the Zytiga stopped working, switched to Xtandi, got a fair but short-lived response. PSA moving up rapidly now..It was 54 two weeks ago... Two years ago, I was seen by a VA oncologist. I needed to do this in order to have the VA supply the Zytiga and Xtandi which even with Part D Medicare I could not afford those co-pays and doughnut holes..I got to like and trust the VA doctor. Both my Medicare oncologist and my VA oncologist agree chemo (Docetaxel) is my next step. Since Quality of Life takes a huge step backwards with this, I have been resisting implementing it, hoping one of the new immunotherapy treatments became available. Yes, I know about Provenge but it's not available through the VA and my Medicare doctor has little faith in it, especially considering its cost. It's very hard to walk into the Chemo Lounge when you have no symptoms and let them push a bag of poison into your veins knowing it will make you sick as hell.. So that's pretty much my journey so far..I just thought I would share it with everyone..I have learned so much from the guys who are on the same journey, thank you all.... Fairwind...",

Also know that the 3 medical specialists involved here (Urologist, Oncologist and Radiation Oncologist) will all favor their own form of treatment...It will be up to YOU to separate the wheat from the chaff....The PSA38 usually means surgery can no longer cure your cancer no matter what the scans reveal...But it CAN remove 95-98% of it thus making the sure to follow radiation treatment much more likely to produce a cure...Many will argue this point, saying surgery would be a waste of time and will expose you to needless risks and side-effects..It will up to you to decide that. Your Radiation Oncologist (you will meet him soon enough) may feel his treatment is all you need, that surgery first would be a waste of time and money...But your Urologist who is also likely a surgeon may have a different outlook.....So read the book (Walsh is a surgeon) research the 'Net and do what you feel is right for you...While your cancer is somewhat advanced it's by no means hopeless. You will learn more as the test results come in and you make your treatment choices..You CAN beat this. You make up your mind based on facts and knowledge and do it. And you never look back.....Again, welcome to the club and the best of luck to you...",

But if THEY had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, I bet they would not be so quick to reject natural or off-patent treatments and drugs...The drug industry is not interested in anything they can not get a patent on and proclaim to their stock-holders they have discovered a new billion dollar a year drug... So does Pomegranate and IP-6 extend the life of prostate cancer patients? The Brits seem to think so with their Pomi-T formulation..But in this country, unless it costs $100,000 a pop, it can't possibly work.... http://www.pomi-t.com/asco-pomi-t-study-summary/",

      "Content": "Not all surgeons are created equal...If you choose surgery, and can get your insurance company to agree, I would seek out a recognized expert to perform the surgery..This is easier said than done..Another form of radiation treatment, Brachytherapy, and brachy combined with external beam can deliver results equal or better than surgery with less side-effect risk..Again, seek out the best doctors you can find and can afford... One other thing to consider..Your G-6 biopsy puts you in low risk, few men ever die from this category..But unless the prostate is removed and the entire gland biopsied, you can't be SURE there is not some higher grade cancer lurking..It is not unusual for pathology reports to be changed to a more threatening form of PC when the organ is removed and examined closely. With radiation, you have to take that needle biopsy at face value and hope for the best and the majority of the time, that's fine... Winning the battle against prostate cancer by Dr. G. Chodak is an up to date book that explains all the treatment options and favors none. Just the facts.....Dr. Walsh's book is more detailed but he is a surgeon so it slants that way a little...Making this decision is the toughest part. Best of luck to you.",

      "Content": "EBRT treatment for PC is changing rapidly. The X-ray machine (LINAC) that delivers the radiation are today greatly improved over what was in use just a few years ago..The need to use 40 fractions to safely deliver an effective dose of radiation has in most cases been reduced to around 20 fractions. Most of the newer LINAC's can be set up to deliver SBRT which requires even fewer fractions to deliver an effective dose. Treatment protocols and techniques are changing rapidly, resulting in more effective treatments and fewer side effects and far less damage to surrounding healthy tissue..So choose a RO who has been trained in the new procedures and has access to up to date equipment..While proton radiation is sometimes used to treat prostate cancer, after several studies could not find any real benefit to using this form of radiation to treat PC, and insurance balked about paying for it, most PC is treated with photon (X-ray) beam radiation. So choose your Radiation Oncologist with the same care you would use to choose a surgeon....",

      "Content": "I have never heard it claimed that the PSA test could diagnose prostate cancer..No matter how high your PSA reading, that does not automatically mean you have Prostate Cancer...All it does is it gives an indication that you are at MUCH higher risk of having prostate cancer and that further testing would be advisable if you wish to find this cancer while it is still curable..Or, just as likely, rule out the possibility you have PC... Dr. Albin states the PSA test has a 80% false positive rate, making it useless for detecting prostate cancer..But the PSA test SHOULD NEVER BE USED FOR DETECTING PROSTATE CANCER so it can't possibly have an 80% false positive rate. Only a BIOPSY can detect prostate cancer with 100% accuracy.. A PSA test is just a tool that points out a biopsy might be a good idea...In the past, men had to wait until a abnormal DRE triggered a biopsy..For many, that was too late...",

In any case, you don't want to bet your life on the results of a single needle biopsy..When patients choose surgery and the entire prostate is removed and biopsied, 30% of the time the pathology is changed to a higher grade of cancer..The TRUS biopsy can easily miss a high-grade tumor giving a false sense of security..",

      "Content": "Radiation and surgery have very similar \"cure\" rates...Much depends on the skill and experience of those providing the treatment...Brachy is a VERY specialized skill, sometimes you must travel to find an expert in this field...Not all RO's feel comfortable doing brachy and therefore they do not recommend it.. The machines that deliver the radiation are called LINAC's, linear accelerators. Over the last few years, great improvements have been made in these machines but a large number of the older ones are still in use... One of the up to date machines is called a Varian RapidArc. You should at least be aware of the age of the machine you will be treated on...The new ones can hit their intended target with great accuracy while limiting the dose delivered to healthy tissue..This can allow a higher (more effective) dose to be delivered to the tumor.. High-dose radiation treatment is NOT without its risks and side-effects..Some occur fairly soon, during and shortly after treatment..Urinary frequency, urgency, bowel problems, fatigue all may appear during treatment...Three years out, impotency becomes an issue for 50% of those treated, same as surgery...Should you be \"cured\", 10-15 years out, secondary cancers and other problems caused by tissue damage may surface..by this time you are 70-75 years old and treatment becomes difficult. Different forms of radiation treatment, proton for instance, claim to deliver effective treatment while greatly limiting side-effects..But again, at the 3 year milepost, they have great difficulty in backing up those claims.. The good news is very few men ever die from Gleason 6 prostate cancer..Whatever treatment you choose will work equally well..Having your \"T\" drop to 16 is a benefit as it will make the radiation work better..It will take your testicles a couple of months to \"get back on the job\" after the 12 year vacation they have had. That's something you might want to monitor closely for a while..You don't need a big \"T\" bounce right now... Your RO might want to put you on a different kind of hormone therapy for a while to keep the \"T\" level low.. Best of luck to you and Merry Christmas!",

      "Content": "I have never heard it claimed that the PSA test could diagnose prostate cancer..No matter how high your PSA reading, that does not automatically mean you have Prostate Cancer...All it does is it gives an indication that you are at MUCH higher risk of having prostate cancer and that further testing would be advisable if you wish to find this cancer while it is still curable..Or, just as likely, rule out the possibility you have PC... Dr. Albin states the PSA test has a 80% false positive rate, making it useless for detecting prostate cancer..But the PSA test SHOULD NEVER BE USED FOR DETECTING PROSTATE CANCER so it can't possibly have an 80% false positive rate. Only a BIOPSY can detect prostate cancer with 100% accuracy.. A PSA test is just a tool that points out a biopsy might be a good idea...In the past, men had to wait until a abnormal DRE triggered a biopsy..For many, that was too late...",

But education never hurts so pick up a copy of Dr Walsh's book \"How to survive prostate cancer\" and learn what you might be facing..Since virtually all men get prostate cancer sooner or later, learning about it now will keep you a step ahead of it....",

Get pre-approvals for any treatment. In making the choice of what treatment to pursue, another book, \"Winning the Battle against Prostate Cancer\" by Dr. Gerald Chodak presents all the treatments in an unbiased manner and is up to date.. A typical treatment plan, you do surgery (pick the best surgeon you can find) and if the margins are clear and his PSA drops to undetectable after 6 weeks, chances are you beat it and you are done..If the cancer has spread to the surgical margin, you are not done. Radiation can be used to clean up after the surgeon. This is called \"salvage radiation\"..It succeeds (produces a cure) about 50% of the time...The radiation can be combined with Hormone Therapy, HT, increasing it's effectiveness substantially but subjecting your husband to heavy side-effects.. That's enough for one night, read the books and talk it over and make your choices...",

      "Content": "EBRT treatment for PC is changing rapidly. The X-ray machine (LINAC) that delivers the radiation are today greatly improved over what was in use just a few years ago..The need to use 40 fractions to safely deliver an effective dose of radiation has in most cases been reduced to around 20 fractions. Most of the newer LINAC's can be set up to deliver SBRT which requires even fewer fractions to deliver an effective dose. Treatment protocols and techniques are changing rapidly, resulting in more effective treatments and fewer side effects and far less damage to surrounding healthy tissue..So choose a RO who has been trained in the new procedures and has access to up to date equipment..While proton radiation is sometimes used to treat prostate cancer, after several studies could not find any real benefit to using this form of radiation to treat PC, and insurance balked about paying for it, most PC is treated with photon (X-ray) beam radiation. So choose your Radiation Oncologist with the same care you would use to choose a surgeon....",

Few if any urologists would recommend surgery...But if ONE of the grades in your Gleason score is a 5, (4+5=9) then that is serious. You can get a copy of your biopsy report from your doctor simply by asking for one. If you have indeed tested positive for PC, now would be a good time to read \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Patrick Walsh. Try and get the newest (third) edition..",

But Medical Oncologists, whose specialty is treating cancer with drugs, are seldom invited to join in these activities...Call it friendly competition for the patients dollar. But they have insights you will not hear from the other two...The gold markers are one way to position you for the R/T but the latest LINAC's (radiation machines) no longer need them...For the $100,000 Medicare will be billed, you might as well be treated on the latest equipment..Am I a little cynical? Yes indeed....But I'm 3 years further along on this journey than you are... It's very important to establish good rapport and trust with your doctors..But if they balk at you getting second opinions (your life is on the line here) then they are not the wonderful people you think they are...The best doctors will welcome second opinions. It protects them and enhances their reputations if the second opinion agrees with them.. Do you have your own copy of your biopsy report? If not, ask for one. You paid for it, It's yours..Your Urologist should have no qualms about giving you a copy. Should you decide to get a second opinion from another doctor, bring that report with you as the doctor will need it...Best of luck to you and please let us know how your journey progresses..",

They should know that when radiation is the primary treatment, some residual PSA is quite normal as you still have a prostate gland... I would certainly get a second opinion on the appropriateness of going back on HT at this time..It is my understanding that it takes at least 2 years for PSA to stabilize after radiation treatment...This fact might have something to do with why the insurance company balked at re-starting the HT...Again, get a second opinion from a Radiation Oncologist.....",

      "Content": "Radiation \"works\" by damaging the DNA in the cancer cells so they can't reproduce..It does not kill all the cancer cells instantly. So PSA seldom plummets after R/T. Rather, there is a slow, steady decline to \"nadir\", some low point that remains stable for years...When R/T is used as a primary treatment, the prostate gland is still able to produce some small amount of PSA and this is what shows up on subsequent PSA tests. If it's used as salvage (trying to salvage a failed surgery) the prostate gland has (hopefully) been completely removed so there is no source of residual PSA..In other words, PSA should drop to zero or very near zero and stay there..When HT is added as an adjunct to radiation, PSA usually drops to a very low number very quickly and will stay there as long as the HT continues. This effect masks whether or not the R/T was effective..You don't really know until you are taken off the HT and the results of the radiation must then stand on their own..... One way to judge whether radiation worked or not, PSA should never rise above what it was before treatment started....If it does, the cancer is still active and further treatment may be necessary....",

The radiation never \"wears off\" If it fails, it's because a few stray cancer cells escaped the treatment..It would take many doubling's before any tiny micro-mets make themselves known....Some men and their Oncologists choose the untra-sensitive PSA test which is 100 times as sensitive as the standard test but that last digit tends to bounce around causing a lot of stress and unnecessary anxiety..",

Get pre-approvals for any treatment. In making the choice of what treatment to pursue, another book, \"Winning the Battle against Prostate Cancer\" by Dr. Gerald Chodak presents all the treatments in an unbiased manner and is up to date.. A typical treatment plan, you do surgery (pick the best surgeon you can find) and if the margins are clear and his PSA drops to undetectable after 6 weeks, chances are you beat it and you are done..If the cancer has spread to the surgical margin, you are not done. Radiation can be used to clean up after the surgeon. This is called \"salvage radiation\"..It succeeds (produces a cure) about 50% of the time...The radiation can be combined with Hormone Therapy, HT, increasing it's effectiveness substantially but subjecting your husband to heavy side-effects.. That's enough for one night, read the books and talk it over and make your choices...",

That procedure combined with IMRT (beam) radiation has demonstrated it can achieve the highest cure rates when performed by experts...Remember that all the doctors you visit with will have a product or procedure he will want to sell you..

Find a Medical Oncologist you like , one that specializes in treating prostate cancer maybe, or at least has many prostate patients, and work out a treatment plan..Hormone therapy or ADT is not fun, the side effects are bad, but it's usually very effective at putting you back in the zero club for a good long while..First, they might like to do a couple of scans to see if they can spot the exact location of the source of the PSA..Sometimes they can still zap it with radiation....Then you decide on whether you will start the ADT immediately or postpone that until your PSA rises to an agreed on level. This approach preserves your quality of life as long as possible...There are good arguments for starting ADT both sooner or later... In the meantime, there is a supplement, Pomi-T, that the Brits have had good success with, what the heck, it can't hurt anything.. http://www.pomi-t.com/asco-pomi-t-study-summary/",

Get pre-approvals for any treatment. In making the choice of what treatment to pursue, another book, \"Winning the Battle against Prostate Cancer\" by Dr. Gerald Chodak presents all the treatments in an unbiased manner and is up to date.. A typical treatment plan, you do surgery (pick the best surgeon you can find) and if the margins are clear and his PSA drops to undetectable after 6 weeks, chances are you beat it and you are done..If the cancer has spread to the surgical margin, you are not done. Radiation can be used to clean up after the surgeon. This is called \"salvage radiation\"..It succeeds (produces a cure) about 50% of the time...The radiation can be combined with Hormone Therapy, HT, increasing it's effectiveness substantially but subjecting your husband to heavy side-effects.. That's enough for one night, read the books and talk it over and make your choices...",

Find a Medical Oncologist you like , one that specializes in treating prostate cancer maybe, or at least has many prostate patients, and work out a treatment plan..Hormone therapy or ADT is not fun, the side effects are bad, but it's usually very effective at putting you back in the zero club for a good long while..First, they might like to do a couple of scans to see if they can spot the exact location of the source of the PSA..Sometimes they can still zap it with radiation....Then you decide on whether you will start the ADT immediately or postpone that until your PSA rises to an agreed on level. This approach preserves your quality of life as long as possible...There are good arguments for starting ADT both sooner or later... In the meantime, there is a supplement, Pomi-T, that the Brits have had good success with, what the heck, it can't hurt anything.. http://www.pomi-t.com/asco-pomi-t-study-summary/",

Prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bones almost always will produce a PSA of WAY above 1.7 So cancer is pretty unlikely the cause of your pain..... The next steps in your diagnosis will likely be dictated by your insurance company. A bone scan would be nice but until you are diagnosed with PC they are unlikely to approve that unless your doctors can work some magic..",

I pay the published copay and that's that..The downside is I must stay in my group which is basically the entire Denver area..If you like to travel, this type of insurance puts you at a disadvantage because it will not pay if you are outside your area...You can buy a plan that offers nationwide coverage but it's considerably more expensive..",

      "Content": "The standard MRI is not sensitive enough to locate prostate cancer until it's pretty far advanced. When your PSA gets up to 50 or 100 the mets begin to show up..... There are a couple of far more sensitive imaging methods available but not all cancer centers are equipped to perform them and when performed they are very expensive and your insurance company is likely to balk....Talk to your Medical Oncologist about whether these advanced scans would benefit you.. There are no side effects associated with Lupron injections..The loss of testosterone causes the litany of undesirable side-effects...Unfortunately, this treatment is also the most effective at restraining advanced prostate cancer...To make matters worse, insurance won't pay for the more advanced treatments until it has been demonstrated the hormone therapy is no longer effective. So if you refuse hormone treatment because you don't like the side-effects, you also forfeit the newest treatments unless you can pay cash for them... Back to the scans...There are men who have sought out the advanced scans, located a few small tumors, usually on the bones someplace but sometimes just a few lymph nodes and then they have had these small mets zapped with radiation. This has been successful in controlling their cancer but since it's not a standard treatment, getting insurance companies to pay for it has been a problem..",

      "Content": "Do I have this correct? In May 2013 a biopsy revealed 5 of 13 cores positive including one a 4+4 high-risk Gleason 8.. Then 18 months later, November 2014 a second biopsy found only a smaller amount of Gleason 6 cancer...but also involved an abnormal DRE... The only explanation I can think of is that the slides of your first biopsy got mixed up somehow and that first biopsy was grossly incorrect it or was for a different person.. I have never seen or heard of a Gleason 8 biopsy with lots of grade 4 cells identified reducing itself to a Gleason 6 finding with no grade 4 cells found.... Did the same urologist and pathology lab perform both of your biopsies?? If so, I would be demanding an explanation as to why they are so different....It's common for high-risk prostate cancer to appear very quickly from nowhere but it's unheard of for a 4=4=8 finding to melt away and only a modest 3=3=6 can be found 18 months later... It might be worth running a DNA test on both sets of slides to be sure they are from the same person....You should have copies of both biopsy reports... To settle the discrepancy, a \"saturation biopsy\" could be performed removing all doubt as to where you stand......",

      "Content": "Do I have this correct? In May 2013 a biopsy revealed 5 of 13 cores positive including one a 4+4 high-risk Gleason 8.. Then 18 months later, November 2014 a second biopsy found only a smaller amount of Gleason 6 cancer...but also involved an abnormal DRE... The only explanation I can think of is that the slides of your first biopsy got mixed up somehow and that first biopsy was grossly incorrect it or was for a different person.. I have never seen or heard of a Gleason 8 biopsy with lots of grade 4 cells identified reducing itself to a Gleason 6 finding with no grade 4 cells found.... Did the same urologist and pathology lab perform both of your biopsies?? If so, I would be demanding an explanation as to why they are so different....It's common for high-risk prostate cancer to appear very quickly from nowhere but it's unheard of for a 4=4=8 finding to melt away and only a modest 3=3=6 can be found 18 months later... It might be worth running a DNA test on both sets of slides to be sure they are from the same person....You should have copies of both biopsy reports... To settle the discrepancy, a \"saturation biopsy\" could be performed removing all doubt as to where you stand......",

It's as simple as that...It costs a lot more than physical castration and sometimes it's not as effective. If your time on ADT is only temporary, an adjunct treatment to radiation, then when you stop taking the drugs your testosterone should return to normal and the effects are reversed. But after 3 or more years on the drugs, the effect tends to become permanent.. So what are the \"side-effects\"? Well they add up to the heaviest load of quality of life changes associated with prostate cancer treatment..In exchange for controlling your incurable cancer, they transform you into a eunuch...The list of physical changes is well known and easy to look up... But given the benefit most men receive, most men choose the life extension HT provides....When HT is administered to men over 65, the effects are hot flashes, loss of most body hair, loss of sex drive and ability, weight gain, fatigue, loss of muscle and bone mass, the whole package...",

      "Content": "The standard MRI is not sensitive enough to locate prostate cancer until it's pretty far advanced. When your PSA gets up to 50 or 100 the mets begin to show up..... There are a couple of far more sensitive imaging methods available but not all cancer centers are equipped to perform them and when performed they are very expensive and your insurance company is likely to balk....Talk to your Medical Oncologist about whether these advanced scans would benefit you.. There are no side effects associated with Lupron injections..The loss of testosterone causes the litany of undesirable side-effects...Unfortunately, this treatment is also the most effective at restraining advanced prostate cancer...To make matters worse, insurance won't pay for the more advanced treatments until it has been demonstrated the hormone therapy is no longer effective. So if you refuse hormone treatment because you don't like the side-effects, you also forfeit the newest treatments unless you can pay cash for them... Back to the scans...There are men who have sought out the advanced scans, located a few small tumors, usually on the bones someplace but sometimes just a few lymph nodes and then they have had these small mets zapped with radiation. This has been successful in controlling their cancer but since it's not a standard treatment, getting insurance companies to pay for it has been a problem..",

      "Content": "The dose is measured in Grays..(Gy) The usual total dose administered by EBRT for prostate cancer is 72 to 80 gray usually given in 40 fractions, , about 1.8 Gy per treatment.. The greater the dose, the more effective it is in killing cancer cells. Unfortunately, once you cross that 80 Gy line, side-effect risk increases rapidly..By dividing the dose by 40, side-effects are greatly reduced without compromising the effectiveness too much.. Studies have shown that the most effective form of radiation combines both EBRT and brachytherapy. This method allows a much higher overall dose, 145 gray, without undue side-effects. Not all men are eligible for this combined treatment.. Your insurance will be billed for each treatment, about $2000 a pop..By using 45 fractions instead of the more common 40, your R.O. just generated an extra $10,000 in treatment costs..But he may have good reasons for using more fractions... Your PSA puts you in the high-risk category and this justifies very aggressive treatment. the side-effects from the radiation are usually easily tolerated, not much at all..Unfortunately, that is not the case with hormone therapy or ADT. This will have major side-effects that will test your marriage.. Nancy will be affected by this just as much as you will...",

I would hold off on that until you have tried ADT, Hormone Therapy, which is usually very effective at controlling prostate cancer for a good many years.. In The States, NO treatment for prostate cancer would start until a biopsy verified that the patient had prostate cancer..The health insurance companies set the rules..Of course, if you have enough money to pay for treatment yourself, you can do anything you want as far as treatment goes... So let us know how your request for a biopsy goes and come back and post the results of that biopsy and we can go over that with you...Best of luck to you...You might read Dr. Walsh's book mentioned in the stickies above..",

Radiation is the gift that keeps on giving...With surgery, what you get is what you get..Side-effects tend to get better, not worse. This is especially true in young men... Gleason scores at biopsy also play an important role in treatment choice..The G-8,9,10 guys, they might as well hit it with EVERYTHING that's available to them...The president of the American Cancer Society publicly stated that almost half of all prostate cancers were not life-threatening and did not need to be treated. Then he added: \"However, there are some prostate cancers that can not be cured, that have already spread no matter how early they are discovered.\" That's why the Docs order MRI's and bone scans before they offer or recommend a treatment.. My own treatment has been surgery, (failed) Radiation + HT, (failed) and now ADT (double blockade, still working)..My first choice would have been Brachy + EBRT but here in Denver, there are few practitioners of this procedure and my HMO type health insurance will not pay for out of area services..Also, my prostate was enlarged to the point that Brachy was not a good match for me....At the time, 85% of the prostate surgeries being performed in Denver were being done on the Da Vinci robot, and my surgeon was a good one but I knew going in that surgery only offered me a 50-50 chance of success but that was better than no chance...",

I hate to say this but in many areas Dr. Walsh's book is becoming outdated and no longer valid....The basic stuff is still good but parts dealing with advanced treatments have fallen behind....",

      "Content": "This was posted on another forum. It's one of the better explanations I've seen..The posters handle is Knotreel.. \"what's happening requires an explanation of your sphincter system. Before the RRP, you had two sphincters, one sphincter associated with your prostate and bladder neck and one at your pelvic floor. You still have the sphincter located in your pelvic floor. The prostate/bladder sphincter is involuntary with no conscious control. The pelvic floor sphincter is mostly consciously controlled (except not so much during sex). Here's roughly how they work. In the case of urination, the bladder fills to a point then the involuntary sphincter opens and allows pressure to be felt by your pelvic floor voluntary sphincter according to bladder pressure. Then you know its time to go and you consciously open the pelvic floor sphincter and urine flows through both sphincters. After the RRP we no longer have the prostate/bladder sphincter In the case of sex, after you gain an erection the \"brain\" down there tells your prostate sphincter to close and to relax the pelvic floor sphincter. Then when ejaculation occurs the fluid is forced though the relaxed pelvic floor sphincter. Females only have the pelvic floor sphincter and males have the other on that closes during sex so that the ejaculate fluid goes where it supposed to, rather than back into the bladder. So when us prostate-less guys we have sex, our only remaining sphincter the usually , the usually voluntary pelvis floor sphincter is trying to relax and there is no prostate sphincter to hold back the urine. I really don't see how this is not a major issue for everyone without a prostate but some of us are apparently not bothered much with this, but I would guess that all of us must have this to some degree. Best thing you can do for now is empty your bladder before.\"",

Radiation is the gift that keeps on giving...With surgery, what you get is what you get..Side-effects tend to get better, not worse. This is especially true in young men... Gleason scores at biopsy also play an important role in treatment choice..The G-8,9,10 guys, they might as well hit it with EVERYTHING that's available to them...The president of the American Cancer Society publicly stated that almost half of all prostate cancers were not life-threatening and did not need to be treated. Then he added: \"However, there are some prostate cancers that can not be cured, that have already spread no matter how early they are discovered.\" That's why the Docs order MRI's and bone scans before they offer or recommend a treatment.. My own treatment has been surgery, (failed) Radiation + HT, (failed) and now ADT (double blockade, still working)..My first choice would have been Brachy + EBRT but here in Denver, there are few practitioners of this procedure and my HMO type health insurance will not pay for out of area services..Also, my prostate was enlarged to the point that Brachy was not a good match for me....At the time, 85% of the prostate surgeries being performed in Denver were being done on the Da Vinci robot, and my surgeon was a good one but I knew going in that surgery only offered me a 50-50 chance of success but that was better than no chance...",

      "Sample": "Gleason 8 is aggressive and frequently leads to follow-up treatment following surgery..There will be some detailed scans before they start radiation to try and determine if the cancer has spread...Don't be surprised if your doctors recommend combining the radiation treatment with hormone treatment..This doubled barrel approach seems to work considerably better than radiation by itself......The grade \"4\" sample means AS would be pretty risky.. If it were me, I would have it treated with curative intent..The URO will recommend surgery because that's what he does...But I would talk to a Radiation Oncologist and see what he has to offer..Then YOU decide what's best for you...Don't overlook brachytherapy (seeds)....Then he added: \"However, there are some prostate cancers that can not be cured, that have already spread no matter how early they are discovered.\" That's why the Docs order MRI's and bone scans before they offer or recommend a treatment.. My own treatment has been surgery, (failed) Radiation + HT, (failed) and now ADT (double blockade, still working)..My first choice would have been Brachy + EBRT but here in Denver, there are few practitioners of this procedure and my HMO type health insurance will not pay for out of area services..Also, my prostate was enlarged to the point that Brachy was not a good match for me....At the time, 85% of the prostate surgeries being performed in Denver were being done on the Da Vinci robot, and my surgeon was a good one but I knew going in that surgery only offered me a 50-50 chance of success but that was better than no chance......See what he thinks about doing both surgery and radiation..Ask HIM to recommend a Radiation Oncologist and talk with him too...Pick up a copy of Dr Walsh's book \"Surviving Prostate Cancer\" and read it carefully. THEN decide on a course of treatment and don't look back....Best of luck to you......There are no doctors here..Find a good Medical Oncologist and sit down and have a long talk with him. See what he thinks about doing both surgery and radiation..Ask HIM to recommend a Radiation Oncologist and talk with him too...Pick up a copy of Dr Walsh's book \"Surviving Prostate Cancer\" and read it carefully....Surgery might be one of them but don't rush into it before you have a complete understanding about what is going on. Read the book I recommended to get a solid background about what your are facing before you make a treatment decision..Be warned, the doctors will all push the product they are selling......G-9 is considered \"high-risk\" and it is NOT unusual for the surgeon to recommend \"adjutant\" radiation treatment following surgery, especially if the post-surgery pathology report is less than perfect...Recent studies have demonstrated that by adding hormone treatment to the radiation, the radiation becomes 50% more effective than when it is used alone... Debating \"salvage\" and \"adjunct\" radiation is just nit-picking, really...It is important that you get yourself as continent as possible before any adjunct radiation treatment as the radiation pretty much stops progress on that front..Going on HT can buy you time in that regard......While my PSA at diagnosis was similar to yours, I had less overall cancer in the cores, only one core with G-9..My surgeon told me surgery had a 50-50 chance of delivering a complete cure, but that with G-9, I should expect to do follow-up radiation regardless..My radiation oncologist said forget the surgery, you will need radiation anyway, so lets just do radiation and HT..I then talked with a Medical Oncologist. Explained my quandary..He gave it some thought and then told me \"I would try the surgery first, and move on to radiation if that fails\"....I took his advise..The surgery DID fail, my PSA hung at 0.9..Not only that, I developed a hospital acquired staff infection that put me back in the hospital for a week and I.V. antibiotics for a month..My only lingering side-effect is 100% impotence..The hot flashes have stopped now that I'm off the HT but I've lost some muscle mass....Have your testosterone level checked..Not all men get the desired response from the Lupron..Your \"T\" level should be less than 20 and ideally less than 10..If it's not, perhaps going back on the Casodex would be of benefit.. Your primary care doctor can perform these tests for you..Surgery is not usually recommended in advanced cases, it can't cure you if the horse has left the barn..But it CAN remove 98% or more of the cancer and that leaves just 2% (or whatever) to deal with and not 100%..Radiation might be a better choice as they can focus the beam on a wider area..Lots of things happen back stage, between the doctors and the insurance companies..(radiation costs about 4 times as much as surgery) In this business, nothing happens until it's decided who is going to pay for it.....KLA, before we can offer advise and help, you need to clarify your Gleason score.. Gleason 5 (3+2=5 or 2+3=5) is seldom if ever reported as being positive for cancer. Few if any urologists would recommend surgery...But if ONE of the grades in your Gleason score is a 5, (4+5=9) then that is serious....Few if any urologists would recommend surgery...But if ONE of the grades in your Gleason score is a 5, (4+5=9) then that is serious. You can get a copy of your biopsy report from your doctor simply by asking for one....You want to see his PSA at 8-12 weeks post surgery..Any ED or incontinence problems will be locked into place by the radiation, no more improvement after that... Also, it is becoming standard to include HT, hormone therapy for at least a year, more often 2 years, before, during and after radiation as it has been shown to make the radiation more effective..He can start that anytime, the sooner the better. of course, that will lock in the ED for as long as he is on it... The doctors can recommend and offer treatments but YOU decide which ones you wish to pursue..Always get a second opinion before you commit to treatments that come with serious side-effects....With a PSA of 5, your scans will probably be clean..That means your treatment team can go for a CURE..That's right, CURE..At 71, surgery is pretty risky so that leaves some form of radiation treatment, which is just as effective but with fewer potential side-effects..The Gleason 9 puts you the high-risk group so you can expect aggressive treatment to be recommended..Is the Grim Reaper just a step behind you ?? NO !! With today's treatments and drugs with more coming soon, they can CURE you or worst case, keep you going for another 8 or 10 years...So enjoy the weekend and stop worrying about things you can't do anything about.. At some point you will want to have a discussion with a Radiation Oncologist....If it were me, I would have it treated with curative intent..The URO will recommend surgery because that's what he does...But I would talk to a Radiation Oncologist and see what he has to offer..Then YOU decide what's best for you...Don't overlook brachytherapy (seeds). Not all RO's can provide that treatment.....Chief, consider Johns advise carefully...There is NO SENSE in undergoing BOTH surgery AND radiation...Choose the treatment that offers the BEST CHANCE of producing a CURE...It is very hard to justify doing surgery when even the surgeon expects radiation will be needed to finish the job....Laying radiation on top of surgery really compounds the side-effect issues..It is the skill of your doctors that will determine your outcome, so choose them carefully..Best of luck to you.....",
