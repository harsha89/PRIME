    "Content": "Hello all. Today I found out that my 59yo father tested positive for prostate cancer. He has been watching his PSA levels rises in the last couple of years, and a couple months ago his urologist recommended that a biopsy be preformed because a PSA test came back at 6.2. Well come to find out that of the 12 biopsies that were taken, one came back positive. The one positive core sample came from the mid lateral left side. The two adjacent areas showed signs of ASAP. The one biopsy that came back positive was 15% cancerous. Not too too bad, but his Gleason Number is 4+4. Not great news. Fortunately we were able to schedule an appointment at MD Anderson here in Houston this week, so hopefully we can get him some treatment as soon as possible. I'm new here just looking for some information on what my father will be going through from here on out. Thanks!",
