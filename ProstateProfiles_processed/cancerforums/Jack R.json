      "Content": "Hi. My father (he's 69 years old) was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. In August 2017, PSA was around 4 (had been around this level for the past few years). In March 2018, PSA was 6. Then he did MRI scan, which suggested the likelihood of cancer. In April 2018, he did MRI-Ultrasound fusion biopsy. The biopsy took 6 cores from right side (Systematic Right Prostate Biopsy), 6 cores from left side (Systematic Left Prostate Biopsy), and 14 cores from other regions (ROI Prostate Biopsy). The result: -One out of 6 right sided cores contain Gleason 3+3 (ISUP Grade 1/5) adenocarcinoma in less than 5% of the core. No perineural invasion or extraprostatic extension is seen. -4 out of 6 left sided cores contain Gleason 3+4 (ISUP Grade 2/5) adenocarcinoma in between 5% and 80% of the core. No perineural invasion or extraprostatic extension is seen. -Other cores show no atypia or malignancy. The urologist suggested that surgery to remove the prostate is the best. But for the surgery, he needs 'clearance' from my father's cardiologist. My father doesn't feel any heart-related problems but he has been routinely seeing a cardiologist to monitor his heart. Based on some tests and scans (which we don't completely understand), his cardiologist has always suggested him to do angiogram but my father always resisted because he feels fine. So regarding the prostate surgery, his cardiologist wants to do angiogram first, before he can give 'clearance'. There's a possibility that angioplasty (installing stents) would be done. If angioplasty does happen, my father needs to take blood thinners non-stop for 3 to 6 months. Thus this scenario would delay the prostate removal surgery for at least 3 to 6 months. The urologist then said that waiting for that length of time is okay and he did not give any medication to take for now. In cases similar like my father's, is it generally okay to delay the surgery for 6 months? And during those 6 months is it generally better to have some medication to 'fight' the cancer? Thanks.",
