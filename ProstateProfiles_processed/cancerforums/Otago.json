      "Content": "Until you get a biopsy you will drive yourself crazy with speculation about how much or how little prostate cancer you may or may not have. You have it or you don't. The two month delay thus far will not have made a difference. Nor will a couple more weeks. \"Biopsy scheduled for this past Friday, but his blood pressure was to low and doctor was concerned about continuing. He needs pre-op clearance before continuing.\" What was his blood pressure? and his age? Seems odd, as a biopsy is hardly a difficult or taxing procedure. If, and its a big if... If he has prostate cancer and metastasis, then it has been going on a long time. Speed, in terms of weeks, won't be changing his eventual treatment. How quickly you get the biopsy and results are really more related to your peace of mind and knowledge of the actual present situation.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by pdxguy1 1. Am I giving up on AS too soon? 2. What kind of nutrition suggestions might you have because it is not unheard for them to not show cancer on a second biopsy after cleaining up your act with better diet and excercise. It doesn't mean it's not there but it probably means it's not advancing. BB History Age: 56 4/13--PSA 101.6 (Prostatitis infection) 5/13--PSA 19.4 (after three weeks of Cipro) 7/13--PSA 9.08 (after more Cipro) 8/13--PSA 7.50 (after 6 weeks of another anti-biotic) 9/13--Biopsy 12 cores (1 poss for PCa Gleason 6 10% involvement, 1 suspicious for PCa, 1 PIN) Prostate size 100cc. Currently on Active Surveillance with a Finasteride Rx. Here is a starting point for your diet http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf You might also look at the published study conducted by Dr. Dean Ornish. http://www.ornishspectrum.com/wp-con...ate_Cancer.pdf I suppose you are aware that taking Finasteride will affect the numbers of your next PSA test. A \"adjustment\" will have to be made with the next results. Now, as to your questions regarding AS. Yes, I think you are giving up too soon. You went from outrageous psa levels almost entirely due to prostatitis to far more moderate levels in only 4 months. Were you aware that MOST prostatitis is NOT caused by bacteria. Making treatment by antibiotics not as effective as you may think. A antibiotic can't kill a bacteria that isn't there. Seems to me, after reading about tough cases of prostatitis that having only 4 months from the first test until the last test is not giving enough time to clearly see what your true PSA is. Thus making a judgment is in my mind very premature. 1 core out of 12 with only 10% involvement. I wouldn't even consider thinking about treatment with that result. At least not until giving the PSA a very good amount of time to calm down. Read more about tough cases of prostatitis and how difficult it can be to treat. It may take even longer than 3 more months. Take a listen to this well respected doctor in the field of prostate cancer. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 You may well have found one of the many indolent cases of prostate cancer only because of your prostatitis. The types of PCa that are better not found. Of course no one can tell for sure, but I'd be on the side of doing nothing until you see some change in course repeated more than once. Thus even if your next test came in at 8.0, I wouldn't leap for treatment. I had a 7.4 PSA not that long ago and many months later I was at 3.8 Sounds like your doctor is in no rush for you to get treatment. Your idea of holding off for a year sounds good. Gives you time to learn more and to lose the initial shock.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by CarlaJean It will only be 3 weeks since his last test. I suppose I am rushing things wanting it checked sooner then later. . If I had one high test of 4.5 (or possibly 9.0 without the drug), I certainly would NOT want to get my next test in 3 weeks. That really doesn't allow time for \"itis\" or inflammation to calm down. Why the rush? More like 3+ months between tests to allow for a better picture. Was it you or the doctor who pushed for 3 weeks. Look at how fast my urologist wanted to re-test when I jumped up to 7.3 PSA 4.1 12/10/2010 PSA 7.3 06/30/2010 PSA 3.5 08/26/2009 (that is only a portion of all my tests. My last test a few months ago was 3.3 , a full 4.0 points below that temporary jump) You see, we waited almost 6 months. 3 weeks is crazy fast unless he was treating you with antibiotics for a infection. Even then, if it was a bacterial caused inflammation, it would still take more time to calm down. Is the doctor doing the testing his primary care doctor or a urologist? Since your husband doesn't even want a biopsy anyway, why the rush? Its not like waiting 3 months is gonna put him in greater danger then he currently is with his other health problems. Looks to me like you are risking a second high PSA test result that may lead to a unnecessary biopsy. I'd leave it alone for a while before stirring up trouble. Of course I'm not a doctor, but very very few men die because they waited a extra 3 months. PS, When I had that 7.3 jump up, I wasn't even aware of any \"itis\" or inflammation. You can get large jumps with what is called asymptomatic prostatitis, meaning you feel nothing unusual.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by pdxguy1 1. Am I giving up on AS too soon? 2. What kind of nutrition suggestions might you have because it is not unheard for them to not show cancer on a second biopsy after cleaining up your act with better diet and excercise. It doesn't mean it's not there but it probably means it's not advancing. BB History Age: 56 4/13--PSA 101.6 (Prostatitis infection) 5/13--PSA 19.4 (after three weeks of Cipro) 7/13--PSA 9.08 (after more Cipro) 8/13--PSA 7.50 (after 6 weeks of another anti-biotic) 9/13--Biopsy 12 cores (1 poss for PCa Gleason 6 10% involvement, 1 suspicious for PCa, 1 PIN) Prostate size 100cc. Currently on Active Surveillance with a Finasteride Rx. Here is a starting point for your diet http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf You might also look at the published study conducted by Dr. Dean Ornish. http://www.ornishspectrum.com/wp-con...ate_Cancer.pdf I suppose you are aware that taking Finasteride will affect the numbers of your next PSA test. A \"adjustment\" will have to be made with the next results. Now, as to your questions regarding AS. Yes, I think you are giving up too soon. You went from outrageous psa levels almost entirely due to prostatitis to far more moderate levels in only 4 months. Were you aware that MOST prostatitis is NOT caused by bacteria. Making treatment by antibiotics not as effective as you may think. A antibiotic can't kill a bacteria that isn't there. Seems to me, after reading about tough cases of prostatitis that having only 4 months from the first test until the last test is not giving enough time to clearly see what your true PSA is. Thus making a judgment is in my mind very premature. 1 core out of 12 with only 10% involvement. I wouldn't even consider thinking about treatment with that result. At least not until giving the PSA a very good amount of time to calm down. Read more about tough cases of prostatitis and how difficult it can be to treat. It may take even longer than 3 more months. Take a listen to this well respected doctor in the field of prostate cancer. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 You may well have found one of the many indolent cases of prostate cancer only because of your prostatitis. The types of PCa that are better not found. Of course no one can tell for sure, but I'd be on the side of doing nothing until you see some change in course repeated more than once. Thus even if your next test came in at 8.0, I wouldn't leap for treatment. I had a 7.4 PSA not that long ago and many months later I was at 3.8 Sounds like your doctor is in no rush for you to get treatment. Your idea of holding off for a year sounds good. Gives you time to learn more and to lose the initial shock. Remember, loads of guys between the ages of 50 and 90 are walking down the street with Gleason 6 in their prostate and know nothing about it and never will. Look at this recent study http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23847245 Well that's one side of the issue. I'm sure you'll get others. Bottom line is that there is no reason to rush.

Just Google (pink ribbon companies) and a few other terms to see how the marketing has progressed. Also, the fact that women are more open to discuss the issue combined with the fact that breast cancer is less curable than prostate cancer. Additionally, there are about 40,000 women who die while \"only\" 30,000 men die. More important, many of the women who die are fairly young, while most men who die are past age 60 and don't create the impact or shock. Lots of reasons for the differences. If you ask about prostate cancer, many think of it as the good cancer which causes few deaths. In other words, everyone gets it and we still see them walking around, living a long life.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by pjr ======================================= 3. What record of false-negative biopsies have you seen here in your practice? 5. We would like to have the slides sent to Dr. Epstein at Johns Hopkins for a second look, regardless of the read. Can we arrange to do this automatically? 8. Should people have a higher Gleason score suggestive of surgery or radiation, where do people typically go for treatment? Who would you recommend? If they seek treatment from a surgeon/radiologist elsewhere, does your office stop treating them? 9. Do you currently have any patients on active surveillance, and if so, how are their cases handled? I think the above questions are getting too far ahead of the game. If you get 12 negative biopsies.. you get 12 negative biopsies. Why chase down issues that are not present?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by pdxguy1 1. Am I giving up on AS too soon? 2. What kind of nutrition suggestions might you have because it is not unheard for them to not show cancer on a second biopsy after cleaining up your act with better diet and excercise. It doesn't mean it's not there but it probably means it's not advancing. BB History Age: 56 4/13--PSA 101.6 (Prostatitis infection) 5/13--PSA 19.4 (after three weeks of Cipro) 7/13--PSA 9.08 (after more Cipro) 8/13--PSA 7.50 (after 6 weeks of another anti-biotic) 9/13--Biopsy 12 cores (1 poss for PCa Gleason 6 10% involvement, 1 suspicious for PCa, 1 PIN) Prostate size 100cc. Currently on Active Surveillance with a Finasteride Rx. Here is a starting point for your diet http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf You might also look at the published study conducted by Dr. Dean Ornish. http://www.ornishspectrum.com/wp-con...ate_Cancer.pdf I suppose you are aware that taking Finasteride will affect the numbers of your next PSA test. A \"adjustment\" will have to be made with the next results. Now, as to your questions regarding AS. Yes, I think you are giving up too soon. You went from outrageous psa levels almost entirely due to prostatitis to far more moderate levels in only 4 months. Were you aware that MOST prostatitis is NOT caused by bacteria. Making treatment by antibiotics not as effective as you may think. A antibiotic can't kill a bacteria that isn't there. Seems to me, after reading about tough cases of prostatitis that having only 4 months from the first test until the last test is not giving enough time to clearly see what your true PSA is. Thus making a judgment is in my mind very premature. 1 core out of 12 with only 10% involvement. I wouldn't even consider thinking about treatment with that result. At least not until giving the PSA a very good amount of time to calm down. Read more about tough cases of prostatitis and how difficult it can be to treat. It may take even longer than 3 more months. Take a listen to this well respected doctor in the field of prostate cancer. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 You may well have found one of the many indolent cases of prostate cancer only because of your prostatitis. The types of PCa that are better not found. Of course no one can tell for sure, but I'd be on the side of doing nothing until you see some change in course repeated more than once. Thus even if your next test came in at 8.0, I wouldn't leap for treatment. I had a 7.4 PSA not that long ago and many months later I was at 3.8 Sounds like your doctor is in no rush for you to get treatment. Your idea of holding off for a year sounds good. Gives you time to learn more and to lose the initial shock. Remember, loads of guys between the ages of 50 and 90 are walking down the street with Gleason 6 in their prostate and know nothing about it and never will. Look at this recent study http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23847245 Well that's one side of the issue. I'm sure you'll get others. Bottom line is that there is no reason to rush. You seem to know that.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Tamborine Hey, thx for the comforting words, but what would cause a big jump in PSA? I neglected to mention that I have had my PSA read a couple of times per year for the last four years (that I've been on HRT) and my reads have always been less than 1.5. Now I suddenly jumped up to 5.0 and 6.3. I eat incredibly healthy - just trust me on that - and am a follower of Pritikin. I also exercise regularly. But the only explanation I see for the above would be \"prostate leak\" or possibly inflammation. But I don't think \"prostate leak\" is common from what I have read and I live quite healthy, so I can't imagine where inflammation would come from.. I've never heard of a \"prostate leak\"... no idea what you are talking about. Now, the fact that your psa is tested twice a year and always has been about 1.5, is all the more reason to believe that the 5.0 and 6.3 are just spikes caused by inflammation. Inflammation can come from many sources and need not be even noticed by the patient. There is a common \"asymptomatic inflammation\" that is as it says, just there, cause unknown. very very common. When a psa goes from 1.5 to 5.0 or 6.3 in a short time, that indicates it is probably from a non-prostate cancer causation. Not always the case, as there are some exceptions. BTW, you should realize that the spike in psa can take time to calm down and return to normal. Weeks, months or so. You eat healthy, Pritikin style. I eat in a similar fashion. Hope you have a good reason to be on HRT. Its becoming very popular. Too popular if you ask me, but I know that is a controversial matter. I just get concerned when all of a sudden it is seen everywhere on TV and radio... Marketing big time. What is 'normal' levels and \"treatable\" levels is very much open to interpretation. Many multiples of men are part of this large ongoing experiment, compared to usage in past decades. However there are some real sound usages for certain men. I know they say HRT is not connected to PCa, but I'd still be very careful about using the product. And I'd double check my psa as you are doing often.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by pdxguy1 1. Am I giving up on AS too soon? 2. What kind of nutrition suggestions might you have because it is not unheard for them to not show cancer on a second biopsy after cleaining up your act with better diet and excercise. It doesn't mean it's not there but it probably means it's not advancing. BB History Age: 56 4/13--PSA 101.6 (Prostatitis infection) 5/13--PSA 19.4 (after three weeks of Cipro) 7/13--PSA 9.08 (after more Cipro) 8/13--PSA 7.50 (after 6 weeks of another anti-biotic) 9/13--Biopsy 12 cores (1 poss for PCa Gleason 6 10% involvement, 1 suspicious for PCa, 1 PIN) Prostate size 100cc. Currently on Active Surveillance with a Finasteride Rx. Here is a starting point for your diet http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf You might also look at the published study conducted by Dr. Dean Ornish. http://www.ornishspectrum.com/wp-con...ate_Cancer.pdf I suppose you are aware that taking Finasteride will affect the numbers of your next PSA test. A \"adjustment\" will have to be made with the next results. Now, as to your questions regarding AS. Yes, I think you are giving up too soon. You went from outrageous psa levels almost entirely due to prostatitis to far more moderate levels in only 4 months. Were you aware that MOST prostatitis is NOT caused by bacteria. Making treatment by antibiotics not as effective as you may think. A antibiotic can't kill a bacteria that isn't there. Seems to me, after reading about tough cases of prostatitis that having only 4 months from the first test until the last test is not giving enough time to clearly see what your true PSA is. Thus making a judgment is in my mind very premature. 1 core out of 12 with only 10% involvement. I wouldn't even consider thinking about treatment with that result. At least not until giving the PSA a very good amount of time to calm down. Read more about tough cases of prostatitis and how difficult it can be to treat. It may take even longer than 3 more months. Take a listen to this well respected doctor in the field of prostate cancer. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 You may well have found one of the many indolent cases of prostate cancer only because of your prostatitis. The types of PCa that are better not found. Of course no one can tell for sure, but I'd be on the side of doing nothing until you see some change in course repeated more than once. Thus even if your next test came in at 8.0, I wouldn't leap for treatment. I had a 7.4 PSA not that long ago and many months later I was at 3.8 Sounds like your doctor is in no rush for you to get treatment. Your idea of holding off for a year sounds good. Gives you time to learn more and to lose the initial shock. Remember, loads of guys between the ages of 50 and 90 are walking down the street with Gleason 6 in their prostate and know nothing about it and never will. Look at this recent study http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23847245 Well that's one side of the issue. I'm sure you'll get others. Bottom line is that there is no reason to rush. You seem to know that.",

If I had one high test of 4.5 (or possibly 9.0 without the drug), I certainly would NOT want to get my next test in 3 weeks. That really doesn't allow time for \"itis\" or inflammation to calm down. Why the rush? More like 3+ months between tests to allow for a better picture. Was it you or the doctor who pushed for 3 weeks. Look at how fast my urologist wanted to re-test when I jumped up to 7.3 PSA 4.1 12/10/2010 PSA 7.3 06/30/2010 PSA 3.5 08/26/2009 (that is only a portion of all my tests. My last test a few months ago was 3.3 , a full 4.0 points below that temporary jump) You see, we waited almost 6 months. 3 weeks is crazy fast unless he was treating you with antibiotics for a infection. Even then, if it was a bacterial caused inflammation, it would still take more time to calm down. Is the doctor doing the testing his primary care doctor or a urologist? Since your husband doesn't even want a biopsy anyway, why the rush? Its not like waiting 3 months is gonna put him in greater danger then he currently is with his other health problems. Looks to me like you are risking a second high PSA test result that may lead to a unnecessary biopsy. I'd leave it alone for a while before stirring up trouble. Of course I'm not a doctor, but very very few men die because they waited a extra 3 months. PS, When I had that 7.3 jump up, I wasn't even aware of any \"itis\" or inflammation. You can get large jumps with what is called asymptomatic prostatitis, meaning you feel nothing unusual.",

The two month delay thus far will not have made a difference. Nor will a couple more weeks. \"Biopsy scheduled for this past Friday, but his blood pressure was to low and doctor was concerned about continuing. He needs pre-op clearance before continuing.\" What was his blood pressure? and his age? Seems odd, as a biopsy is hardly a difficult or taxing procedure. If, and its a big if... If he has prostate cancer and metastasis, then it has been going on a long time. Speed, in terms of weeks, won't be changing his eventual treatment. How quickly you get the biopsy and results are really more related to your peace of mind and knowledge of the actual present situation.",

We would like to have the slides sent to Dr. Epstein at Johns Hopkins for a second look, regardless of the read. Can we arrange to do this automatically? 8. Should people have a higher Gleason score suggestive of surgery or radiation, where do people typically go for treatment? Who would you recommend? If they seek treatment from a surgeon/radiologist elsewhere, does your office stop treating them? 9. Do you currently have any patients on active surveillance, and if so, how are their cases handled? I think the above questions are getting too far ahead of the game. If you get 12 negative biopsies.. you get 12 negative biopsies. Why chase down issues that are not present?",

(I know the answer to that is money). No, it is not about money. There is a huge debate as to whether any PSA testing should be done, let alone many years younger. I don't recall reading why you had your psa taken at age 38, but I don't know of anyone suggesting those under age 40 get the test. Actually its not only about the cost of testing, but more about the cost of treating so many people who probably don't need treating. Indolent cases. The entire field of testing and treating is a mess that won't be solved until they develop some method of knowing which cases need treatment and which don't.

Just Google (pink ribbon companies) and a few other terms to see how the marketing has progressed. Also, the fact that women are more open to discuss the issue combined with the fact that breast cancer is less curable than prostate cancer. Additionally, there are about 40,000 women who die while \"only\" 30,000 men die. More important, many of the women who die are fairly young, while most men who die are past age 60 and don't create the impact or shock. Lots of reasons for the differences. If you ask about prostate cancer, many think of it as the good cancer which causes few deaths. In other words, everyone gets it and we still see them walking around, living a long life.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Tamborine Hey, thx for the comforting words, but what would cause a big jump in PSA? I neglected to mention that I have had my PSA read a couple of times per year for the last four years (that I've been on HRT) and my reads have always been less than 1.5. Now I suddenly jumped up to 5.0 and 6.3. I eat incredibly healthy - just trust me on that - and am a follower of Pritikin. I also exercise regularly. But the only explanation I see for the above would be \"prostate leak\" or possibly inflammation. But I don't think \"prostate leak\" is common from what I have read and I live quite healthy, so I can't imagine where inflammation would come from.. I've never heard of a \"prostate leak\"... no idea what you are talking about. Now, the fact that your psa is tested twice a year and always has been about 1.5, is all the more reason to believe that the 5.0 and 6.3 are just spikes caused by inflammation. Inflammation can come from many sources and need not be even noticed by the patient. There is a common \"asymptomatic inflammation\" that is as it says, just there, cause unknown. very very common. When a psa goes from 1.5 to 5.0 or 6.3 in a short time, that indicates it is probably from a non-prostate cancer causation. Not always the case, as there are some exceptions. BTW, you should realize that the spike in psa can take time to calm down and return to normal. Weeks, months or so. You eat healthy, Pritikin style. I eat in a similar fashion. Hope you have a good reason to be on HRT. Its becoming very popular. Too popular if you ask me, but I know that is a controversial matter. I just get concerned when all of a sudden it is seen everywhere on TV and radio... Marketing big time. What is 'normal' levels and \"treatable\" levels is very much open to interpretation. Many multiples of men are part of this large ongoing experiment, compared to usage in past decades. However there are some real sound usages for certain men. I know they say HRT is not connected to PCa, but I'd still be very careful about using the product. And I'd double check my psa as you are doing often.",

I neglected to mention that I have had my PSA read a couple of times per year for the last four years (that I've been on HRT) and my reads have always been less than 1.5. Now I suddenly jumped up to 5.0 and 6.3. I eat incredibly healthy - just trust me on that - and am a follower of Pritikin. I also exercise regularly. But the only explanation I see for the above would be \"prostate leak\" or possibly inflammation. But I don't think \"prostate leak\" is common from what I have read and I live quite healthy, so I can't imagine where inflammation would come from.. I've never heard of a \"prostate leak\"... no idea what you are talking about. Now, the fact that your psa is tested twice a year and always has been about 1.5, is all the more reason to believe that the 5.0 and 6.3 are just spikes caused by inflammation. Inflammation can come from many sources and need not be even noticed by the patient. There is a common \"asymptomatic inflammation\" that is as it says, just there, cause unknown. very very common. When a psa goes from 1.5 to 5.0 or 6.3 in a short time, that indicates it is probably from a non-prostate cancer causation. Not always the case, as there are some exceptions. BTW, you should realize that the spike in psa can take time to calm down and return to normal. Weeks, months or so. You eat healthy, Pritikin style. I eat in a similar fashion. Hope you have a good reason to be on HRT. Its becoming very popular. Too popular if you ask me, but I know that is a controversial matter. I just get concerned when all of a sudden it is seen everywhere on TV and radio... Marketing big time. What is 'normal' levels and \"treatable\" levels is very much open to interpretation. Many multiples of men are part of this large ongoing experiment, compared to usage in past decades. However there are some real sound usages for certain men. I know they say HRT is not connected to PCa, but I'd still be very careful about using the product. And I'd double check my psa as you are doing often.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Popi PSA came back at 2.25, so she sent me to a Urologist for a follow-up. Second test came back at 2.45, but not knowing any better, I had sex 18hrs prior to second test. (don't remember if I had sex prior to first test) DRE was normal. He would like to wait until January for a third test, which makes sense, but I will be the first to admit, I want immediate answers, and this just isn't cutting it. . Goodness, slow down. You've had essentially one single PSA test of 2.35 (the second one right away is simply a retest so average the two) Sounds like you just had it recently in November. Even getting the next test in January is almost too fast to see if anything of shorter duration impact would give you what you feel is a score that is too high. Waiting only two months is actually extremely short. Most doctors would tell you to wait 3 or 4 months to get a better picture. Of more concern is your concern. You have yourself in diapers after one PSA test that is only 2.35 average. You know, even if your next test comes back at 2.45, I doubt your urologist is going to recommend you get a biopsy right away. Rather he'll probably look at it and suggest a PSA retest in 3 more months. So then you'll be right where you are today, once again. Now if you urge him to do a biopsy now, he might relent and do so, but you should be aware that a great deal of biopsies don't find cancer even when it exists. Thus what will you be thinking after it comes back negative? More worry, more rapid PSA testing? I'm thinking your mindset is well ahead of the facts at this point. Not sure what to say to you to calm you down.",

He said that it was extremely rare for someone my age to have a PSA that high or Testosterone that low- let alone both. He said there was probably a 30% chance that I have prostate cancer. I am taking anti-biotics for a few weeks then going to get retested. If the numbers don't change I will be having a biopsy. I'd say that borders on malpractice. To immediately run you through a series of anti-biotics and then retest in what sounds like it may only be a few weeks is just plain nuts. A reasonable urologist would allow some significant time to elapse between testing. Not just a few weeks. The antibiotics are probably a waste of time as most prostatitis is not bacterial in origin. At any rate, if he retests you in a couple week (which is poor practice)... and your psa is still 4.0 or higher... then do NOT allow a biopsy to be taken. Instead wait at least another month or two and retest your psa. It is very very common for inflammations of the prostate to take simple plain old time to calm down. Not from antibiotics... not from early testing... just simple time. To rush ahead with a biopsy in only a few weeks is insane. I think it borders on malpractice in light of the overwhelmingly rare chance that you would have prostate cancer at age 30. Should a quick retest come in still high, and the urologist wants to do a biopsy, ask him why the rush. Ask him if its OK to wait a couple months and retest.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Steve2015 I'm not sure what 6/10 means but that is how it is written on the report. I'm looking for a way to eradicate the cancer cells without surgery or radiation. I have no problem setting my own protocol based on my own research that is backed by documented permanent cures. I am a young 65. My father, his siblings and his parents, all lived to be about 90. That's my goal for now. Thanks for your response. 6/10 means 6 on a scale of 10. You have one 5% Gleason 6. In short, you are a completely normal 65 year old. If another 100 men your age were grabbed off the street and given several biopsies, about 50% of them would eventually be found to have prostate cancer. Yet only 1 out of 30 of them would have their lifespan shortened by prostate cancer. Many irregular DRE exams lead to biopsies. That is proper, but many times the irregular spot has nothing to do with prostate cancer. You did not mention if the one tiny Gleason 6 that was found was at the site of the irregular DRE spot. If not, then your one positive core was just found randomly and you'd probably never have been tested at this time, but for the irregular DRE. So, if that is the case, then you are just like 50 of the other 100 guys walking down the street. Except now, you are classified as a prostate cancer patient. From what you've stated, I'd do absolutely nothing for now, except to improve your diet. You do not need to \"eradicate\" your prostate cancer, in that it will probably not shorten your life. I am very familiar with DES as my father was on the drug for over 20 years. He was diagnosed at age 63, radiated at age 64, and lived until age 88, dying of other causes. At about age 84 he was having swollen legs, which I suspected were from the DES. Causing him lots of problems. So I read the literature in a nearby major medical school university library (pre-internet). I did not find a lot of information, but did find one interesting case report where a long term patient on DES \"only\", just stopped taking it for a few years, then returned to the doctor. They tested his PSA and it remained at zero... Perhaps foolishly, I took my father off the DES... and nothing happened for a few days... then one morning he walked in wearing his bathrobe and his formerly swollen legs, below the knee, had overnight become skinny and normal. It was like a miracle, and all of his related leg problems went away. Now, a few months later I went with him to his new urologist ( his 20 year urologist had just retired)... and his urologist was pissed off.. disgusted.. Very unfriendly with my ill advised experiment. Still, he sent him to the lab for his PSA... (wouldn't even give him a DRE...saying why do it) Needless to say, I did not like that new doctor. So the PSA report comes back... 0.0.... And it stayed that way for the rest of his life..about 4 more years. Now, did the DES shut down the process of producing PSA... as was the example in the case report that I read. Or was my father's prostate cancer ALL eradicated by the radiation some 20 years prior? We don't know the answer. In that case report, that patient's PSA production seems to have shut down due entirely to the DES... As you can imagine, no one was medically willing or financially motivated to take 100 long term DES users off their medication to see what the trial would produce in terms of outcome. DES is still a good drug and very very cheap if you can find it. It got a bad rap because used in higher doses, it caused heart problems in some patients. Taking on a 1 mg dose for years did not seem to cause the same problems, although it comes with several side effects that in your situation I don't imagine you'd be willing to accept, given that your current status seems fairly benign. In short, if I was you, I'd do nothing at all. Re-test your psa in 6 months or a year... and keep doing that, perhaps getting another biopsy in 12 or 18 months. If you don't have any real problem, you don't need to eradicate anything.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Popi PSA came back at 2.25, so she sent me to a Urologist for a follow-up. Second test came back at 2.45, but not knowing any better, I had sex 18hrs prior to second test. (don't remember if I had sex prior to first test) DRE was normal. He would like to wait until January for a third test, which makes sense, but I will be the first to admit, I want immediate answers, and this just isn't cutting it. . Goodness, slow down. You've had essentially one single PSA test of 2.35 (the second one right away is simply a retest so average the two) Sounds like you just had it recently in November. Even getting the next test in January is almost too fast to see if anything of shorter duration impact would give you what you feel is a score that is too high. Waiting only two months is actually extremely short. Most doctors would tell you to wait 3 or 4 months to get a better picture. Of more concern is your concern. You have yourself in diapers after one PSA test that is only 2.35 average. You know, even if your next test comes back at 2.45, I doubt your urologist is going to recommend you get a biopsy right away. Rather he'll probably look at it and suggest a PSA retest in 3 more months. So then you'll be right where you are today, once again. Now if you urge him to do a biopsy now, he might relent and do so, but you should be aware that a great deal of biopsies don't find cancer even when it exists. Thus what will you be thinking after it comes back negative? More worry, more rapid PSA testing? I'm thinking your mindset is well ahead of the facts at this point. Not sure what to say to you to calm you down.",

He'd still have the biopsy, but depending on whether the true psa is 3.0 or 7.0 might make me more or less concerned about taking any treatment sooner or later in time. PSA rises unrelated to prostate cancer can take a month or months to calm down for a true psa reading. Certainly a few days or weeks is not sufficient to calm down in many cases.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Shinytop To me AS has always been about not taking action until the surveillance shows it has become more aggressive. It seems logical that the longer you go the odds increase that your Gleason can rise. I am a 6 and only 5 months into my AS. At age 66 I like my odds.. I don't believe there is much reason to believe that a typical Gleason 6 will turn into a Gleason 7. While it makes a sort of logical sense, most evidence would indicate a Gleason 6 usually remains a Gleason 6. Now, a previously undetected Gleason 7 may show up,, but the original Gleason 6 mostly stays just that. I have read of instances where that is not the case, but generally speaking I don't believe one switches into the other. If you are 66 and can delay treatment for 2 years or 5 years, there is some value in that. Every year untreated is of some value unless you spend the entire time in worry and concern. At the very least, as you indicated, you now know much more about prostate cancer. Of course I don't recall your precise details... number of positive cores, psa history, etc.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Would you trust your gut instinct in a decision like this? or would you trust the data, the science. I suppose the issue would be regarding the \"SEs less with Brachy\" that you spoke about. If you are willing to accept the accurate probability of those being something you will deal with, then I guess surgery is your route. I think the problem is sometimes that we all think the SEs won't happen to us, that we'll be in the 25% or 50% that doesn't get them, or that they aren't permanent. Often this revolves around post surgery sexual function. Whether there is a high, medium, or low probability of sexual function returning to pre-surgical conditions. I don't know what your reading has done to your assessment of what is probable....or how much that matters to you vs the \"get it out\" comfort. The concerns about urinary continence seems of less concern because most men think that will return to normal with time. However for those that don't it is often thought to be a much larger issue than the sexual function. So anyway, do you have expectations about how those issues will likely be depending on whether you do surgery or brachy?",

As to the sexual function, my only issue would be for you to be sure what they mean by the data. Meaning what is their definition of full function and usable erection. Often times that definition differs widely from what most men are currently getting prior to surgery. Of course as we age (I'm also 64) there is a natural decline in that department anyway. I must say though, I had close friend, our age, who had earlier robotic surgery 7 years ago, and though he didn't get back full natural function, he has done quite well with drugs and injections.

I can't think of a better surgeon than you have if you go that route.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Would you trust your gut instinct in a decision like this? or would you trust the data, the science. I suppose the issue would be regarding the \"SEs less with Brachy\" that you spoke about. If you are willing to accept the accurate probability of those being something you will deal with, then I guess surgery is your route. I think the problem is sometimes that we all think the SEs won't happen to us, that we'll be in the 25% or 50% that doesn't get them, or that they aren't permanent. Often this revolves around post surgery sexual function. Whether there is a high, medium, or low probability of sexual function returning to pre-surgical conditions. I don't know what your reading has done to your assessment of what is probable....or how much that matters to you vs the \"get it out\" comfort. The concerns about urinary continence seems of less concern because most men think that will return to normal with time. However for those that don't it is often thought to be a much larger issue than the sexual function. So anyway, do you have expectations about how those issues will likely be depending on whether you do surgery or brachy?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Double Trouble I am 53 years old. I had a PSA reading of 1.03 last year. About 2 months ago I had another blood test done during a routine physical and I had a PSA reading of 2.97 or almost triple of my earlier one. Taking my doctor's advice I went to a Urologist who scheduled another blood test about a month later and my PSA reading came back lower than the resent one at 1.95 but still almost double my original one. My Urologist told me I had two options. He said I could wait 6 months and have another blood test done and review the scores of that one and decide on a treatment plan then or I could take the pro-active approach and have the biopsy done now. . Your PSA result dropped by a full point in only one month. Highly indicative that the prior 2 point rise had nothing to do with prostate cancer. Actually you probably should have waited he six months and then tested again. Very possible you would have been down at 1.0 or under 1.5. If prostate cancer had driven it up to 2.97 from 1.03 in only a year, then it most likely wouldn't have dropped back to 1.95 in a month. Do you understand that? Many other things can make a PSA spike. Originally Posted by Double Trouble After careful consideration with my doctor and considering the risks of doing a biopsy and waiting the 6 months in a state of mind were I would always be wondering, I decided to do the biopsy now. I had it done on Sept. 12th. My Urologist told me that visibly my prostate looked healthy but enlarged which I was already aware of (the enlarged part). He also made it perfectly clear that although he may have the biopsy results back in 7 to 10 days I could not call him or the office in order to get the results and I would have to wait until the next time that I saw him in order to get the results. My next appointment is not until Sept 27 so I have to wait another 6 days before I get any type of answer. . Absolutely no need for you to wait 15 days for the results. He could probably get the results in less than a week. Perhaps in a couple days. Now, he may give out that standard practice of not giving you the answer without seeing you in person, because if he said he only calls the negative reports, then anyone who needed to come in would infer they had a positive result of prostate cancer at which time he can then counsel the patient. So instead he tells everyone to come in, then tells 75d% of them everything is just fine. I don't like that policy and can't know if its just a way to make more quick appointments for money. My doctor gave me the results over the phone, but I don't think he would do any differently if he had found prostate cancer. In fact I think his nurse called me, but then I later talked to him. I don't think you can read anything into it either way. Originally Posted by Double Trouble Is this standard with this type of thing? I suffer from bi-polar disorder and am very easily depressed. With this, I easily find myself thinking of the worst case scenarios when I find myself waiting for different test results. Do I have a right to call him and ask for my results earlier over the phone? Is this visit to his office just another way of the doctors practice to raise the cost associated with my testing and treatment? Are my past PSA readings indicative of a positive outcome on the biopsy? . I'd say your drop from 2.97 back to 1.95 in a month is highly indicative that you will have negative finding. In fact THAT is the reason why the doctor offered you the option of waiting six months and then doing another PSA test. I give him credit for that offer. I'd say you never needed the biopsy in the first place, or perhaps should I say, it wouldn't have harmed you or placed you in danger to wait the 6 months EVEN if the eventual biopsy found something. Except for your inclination to worry. Right now, just wait 6 days, or if it will save you money for a visit, you could call and ask for the results. All he can say is NO.... You are blowing this out of proportion as to your thinking the worst. Again, the large drop back down indicates that the rise in PSA was NOT from prostate cancer. You are about as likely as the next 53 year old guy walking down the street to have prostate cancer. All those other guys won't be worrying the next 6 days. On the other hand, if you grabbed the next one hundred 53 year old guys by random and gave them all biopsies, you'd come up with a few who had low grade prostate cancer, just because its out there in many men. However in most of them you don't really want to find it because in most of them its not going to harm them. If you haven't read that much about this subject you may not understand that. Most men who die at age 80 or 90 will have prostate cancer. It just won't have anything to do with their death. Its just out there in many many men undiagnosed. Odds are high you'll be just fine.

Your husband could have various PSA readings, but that would NOT be a reason for a doctor to use the term \"urgent\".

      "Content": "Originally Posted by heatdoctor After several yearly PSA's of around 1.5, this year mine jumped to 5.6. I am 67 years young. I was scheduled for a biopsy. So, that is what I did & the result was that my PSA went back down to 1.4. I have had 3 digital exams over the past 2 months & they are more or less unremarkable. So, the BIG question is what do I do now? There seems to be no consensus. Who in the world scheduled you for a biopsy after just one elevated PSA and a normal DRE? How insane was that. With your age and past history its hard to imagine why any doctor or urologist would do that unless they just wanted to collect another fee. Really crazy behavior if you ask me. Lucky you were smart enough to do some reading on your own. As to what you should do now.........NOTHING.... Oh I suppose you can get another psa in 6 weeks, but even if that one is 3.0 or 5.0, I would not submit to a biopsy. Rather I would wait and again repeat the psa in another 6 weeks. As the other poster said, prostate cancer does not make a steady 1.5 jump to 5.6 and then back down to 1.4.......in line with all your prior tests. Amazing that a urologist would allow a biopsy without waiting and perhaps giving you a round of antibiotics.. Please be aware you can have various forms of prostatitis that can greatly raise your psa. Also be aware that the prostatitis can be bacterial or non-bacterial and can even be asymptomatic....leaving you unaware of its presence. Under most circumstances, a man of your age need not be in a rush, nor should he be rushed into a biopsy. If the next one comes back raised, please realize the same causation for the first raised psa could have returned and that does not mean its prostate cancer. The danger for someone your age, who probably has a true 1.5 to 2.0 psa is that indeed they could do a biopsy and find some minor cancer, thus putting you on the train for treatment when had you never had that blip up in psa, you would probably have lived to 90 never having any need for treatment. Just because indolent prostate cancer is there doesn't mean you always want to find it. By age 80 or 90 most men who die of other causes, also die with undiagnosed prostate cancer. Not all, but most. Take your time. Don't be pushed into anything quickly. You may want to get a second opinion should this issue arise again. It really sounds like you did exactly the correct thing in waiting and it calls into question the advice of the person who scheduled you for a biopsy without waiting.",

Your Stanford doctor is being entirely honest. Saving the nerve bundles does nothing to improve sexual performance. Very good chance that even with the nerves saved that you will experience some decline in performance, possibly offset by the use is Viagra, etc. But even then, most men do not come back as well as before regarding performance. Now, on the optimistic side, in seeing Dr. Peter Carroll at UCSF, you are seeing one of the finest doctors in the nation. He will give you clear information about your best choice regarding surgery, radiation, seeds, or active surveillance. I don't know what he will say, but I'd place great trust in his best advice and the reality you can expect afterwards if you choose surgery. Come back after you see him and tell us what he said. Oh yes, and you might include all your numbers. PSA scores, biopsy scores, number of positive cores, percentage of each core that is positive, etc. The details. Makes it easier for readers to understand your current situation and diagnosis.",

Doc has never has used the word urgent before, even with my tests, diagnosis and treatment. . . There is NO need for a doctor to say \"urgent\" if the problem is a high PSA. Your concerns regarding that are misguided. He might very well say \"urgent\" for a infection. Your husband could have various PSA readings, but that would NOT be a reason for a doctor to use the term \"urgent\". I hope you can explain that to your husband who need not be concerned about the doctor using that term EXCEPT for the most probable explanation, a infection.",

      "Content": "Most cases of prostate cancer have been developing over many years. It did not just start up within 6 months. You are correct, the PSA test is not very reliable in predicting prostate cancer. But it is what indicates that a biopsy may be needed. The psa test is more useful in following patients after surgery or radiation. The jump from psa 3.6 to 7.13 may not all have been from the growth or progression of cancer. PSA results can vary widely, independent of cancer being present. Mine has jumped from about 3.8 to 7.5, only to fall back under 3.8 by the next test. I don't recall the age of your husband, but by age 55 through 70, as many as 50% of men are walking around with prostate cancer. In most it will never develop into a problem, but it is present, often undiagnosed. By the age of 80 or later, almost all men can be found to have some prostate cancer present, though it never affects most of them. In other words, late in life, it is more natural to have prostate cancer than to not have it.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by heatdoctor After several yearly PSA's of around 1.5, this year mine jumped to 5.6. I am 67 years young. I was scheduled for a biopsy. So, that is what I did & the result was that my PSA went back down to 1.4. I have had 3 digital exams over the past 2 months & they are more or less unremarkable. So, the BIG question is what do I do now? There seems to be no consensus. Who in the world scheduled you for a biopsy after just one elevated PSA and a normal DRE? How insane was that. With your age and past history its hard to imagine why any doctor or urologist would do that unless they just wanted to collect another fee. Really crazy behavior if you ask me. Lucky you were smart enough to do some reading on your own. As to what you should do now.........NOTHING.... Oh I suppose you can get another psa in 6 weeks, but even if that one is 3.0 or 5.0, I would not submit to a biopsy. Rather I would wait and again repeat the psa in another 6 weeks. As the other poster said, prostate cancer does not make a steady 1.5 jump to 5.6 and then back down to 1.4.......in line with all your prior tests. Amazing that a urologist would allow a biopsy without waiting and perhaps giving you a round of antibiotics.. Please be aware you can have various forms of prostatitis that can greatly raise your psa. Also be aware that the prostatitis can be bacterial or non-bacterial and can even be asymptomatic....leaving you unaware of its presence. Under most circumstances, a man of your age need not be in a rush, nor should he be rushed into a biopsy. If the next one comes back raised, please realize the same causation for the first raised psa could have returned and that does not mean its prostate cancer. The danger for someone your age, who probably has a true 1.5 to 2.0 psa is that indeed they could do a biopsy and find some minor cancer, thus putting you on the train for treatment when had you never had that blip up in psa, you would probably have lived to 90 never having any need for treatment. Just because indolent prostate cancer is there doesn't mean you always want to find it. By age 80 or 90 most men who die of other causes, also die with undiagnosed prostate cancer. Not all, but most. Take your time. Don't be pushed into anything quickly. You may want to get a second opinion should this issue arise again. It really sounds like you did exactly the correct thing in waiting and it calls into question the advice of the person who scheduled you for a biopsy without waiting.",

      "Content": "Hi, a few points that may help others answer. What is your age? What is your history of PSA tests results and dates besides the two mentioned. It appears from the T2a stage that the doctor felt something on the DRE. Was that felt by the urologist or your primary doctor or both? The one sample that was Gleason 6, 0.6 mm long. Do you know what percentage of the sample that is? If that psa of 4.7 hadn't included the doctor also feeling something on the DRE, they may well have waited a while and done another PSA test before doing a biopsy. Personally, later on, after things calm down post biopsy, I might want to re-test the PSA to see if its still 4.7 or much lower or higher. What does the doctor say. After all he is the one who felt something abnormal on the DRE. How did he describe what he felt? and where it was located. Doesn't sound like you have to rush into any treatment soon. Time to learn lots more and consider all your options. It would seem like you can easily extend that decision process into the beginning of next year, but then again we don't know all the details that your doctor has.",

      "Content": "So your first ever PSA was done about age 62 in 2010. I asked what the doctor felt because you listed the status as T2a which normally means he feels something other than just normal enlargement. A harder area or a nodule. Other wise it would be T1c, discovered only by needle biopsy. You might ask him about that sometime. You might also find out what percentage of that core sample the 0.6mm represents. Like, 10% or 30% or 50% etc. Not knowing to much about the length of the entire sample we don't know. Look at this from a study on such... \"The mean length of 7,126 analysed cores was 14.14\u2002±\u20024.35\u2002mm. All cores were longer than 10\u2002mm. The mean length of needle cores sampled did not correlate with patient age, total prostate-specific antigen value, digital rectal examination, and prostate volume. The whole mean length of the six samples from the peripheral zone of the right lobe was higher than the mean corresponding value of the six samples from the left lobe peripheral zone (p\u2002<\u20020.001). The transperineal approach allows a greater sampling of the prostate apex than of the midgland and prostate base (p\u2002<\u20020.001).\" If your core sample was 10 mm then 0.6 would only be 6% which would be very low (meaning good) But as I indicated, I know very little about this or how they arrive at percent of sample.

If its all simple math then 0.6 mm of even the shortest is less than 9%, while the other two possibilities would be 7% and 5%. If indeed that is how the math is done then all of those are very low, meaning good. Perhaps someone here knows more about the calculation methods. Of course your doctor would have the best and most precise answer for that, as well as the question about the DRE and why you were listed as T2a vs T1c All in all it sounds very manageable whether you do AS or some treatment. Certainly seems like you have time to explore all choices before deciding.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Double Trouble I am 53 years old. I had a PSA reading of 1.03 last year. About 2 months ago I had another blood test done during a routine physical and I had a PSA reading of 2.97 or almost triple of my earlier one. Taking my doctor's advice I went to a Urologist who scheduled another blood test about a month later and my PSA reading came back lower than the resent one at 1.95 but still almost double my original one. My Urologist told me I had two options. He said I could wait 6 months and have another blood test done and review the scores of that one and decide on a treatment plan then or I could take the pro-active approach and have the biopsy done now. . Your PSA result dropped by a full point in only one month. Highly indicative that the prior 2 point rise had nothing to do with prostate cancer. Actually you probably should have waited he six months and then tested again. Very possible you would have been down at 1.0 or under 1.5. If prostate cancer had driven it up to 2.97 from 1.03 in only a year, then it most likely wouldn't have dropped back to 1.95 in a month. Do you understand that? Many other things can make a PSA spike. Originally Posted by Double Trouble After careful consideration with my doctor and considering the risks of doing a biopsy and waiting the 6 months in a state of mind were I would always be wondering, I decided to do the biopsy now. I had it done on Sept. 12th. My Urologist told me that visibly my prostate looked healthy but enlarged which I was already aware of (the enlarged part). He also made it perfectly clear that although he may have the biopsy results back in 7 to 10 days I could not call him or the office in order to get the results and I would have to wait until the next time that I saw him in order to get the results. My next appointment is not until Sept 27 so I have to wait another 6 days before I get any type of answer. . Absolutely no need for you to wait 15 days for the results. He could probably get the results in less than a week. Perhaps in a couple days. Now, he may give out that standard practice of not giving you the answer without seeing you in person, because if he said he only calls the negative reports, then anyone who needed to come in would infer they had a positive result of prostate cancer at which time he can then counsel the patient. So instead he tells everyone to come in, then tells 75d% of them everything is just fine. I don't like that policy and can't know if its just a way to make more quick appointments for money. My doctor gave me the results over the phone, but I don't think he would do any differently if he had found prostate cancer. In fact I think his nurse called me, but then I later talked to him. I don't think you can read anything into it either way. Originally Posted by Double Trouble Is this standard with this type of thing? I suffer from bi-polar disorder and am very easily depressed. With this, I easily find myself thinking of the worst case scenarios when I find myself waiting for different test results. Do I have a right to call him and ask for my results earlier over the phone? Is this visit to his office just another way of the doctors practice to raise the cost associated with my testing and treatment? Are my past PSA readings indicative of a positive outcome on the biopsy? . I'd say your drop from 2.97 back to 1.95 in a month is highly indicative that you will have negative finding. In fact THAT is the reason why the doctor offered you the option of waiting six months and then doing another PSA test. I give him credit for that offer. I'd say you never needed the biopsy in the first place, or perhaps should I say, it wouldn't have harmed you or placed you in danger to wait the 6 months EVEN if the eventual biopsy found something. Except for your inclination to worry. Right now, just wait 6 days, or if it will save you money for a visit, you could call and ask for the results. All he can say is NO.... You are blowing this out of proportion as to your thinking the worst. Again, the large drop back down indicates that the rise in PSA was NOT from prostate cancer. You are about as likely as the next 53 year old guy walking down the street to have prostate cancer. All those other guys won't be worrying the next 6 days. On the other hand, if you grabbed the next one hundred 53 year old guys by random and gave them all biopsies, you'd come up with a few who had low grade prostate cancer, just because its out there in many men. However in most of them you don't really want to find it because in most of them its not going to harm them. If you haven't read that much about this subject you may not understand that. Most men who die at age 80 or 90 will have prostate cancer. It just won't have anything to do with their death. Its just out there in many many men undiagnosed. Odds are high you'll be just fine.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Cancerinoregon the tomato juice with the lycopene that I read had helped in studies. Now he's taking the SP only. I am worried though. Can the SP actually kill cancer cells in time, not just reduce the hormone? They never gave him the option of hormone therapy because his hormones were fine I guess. I had read that the following are useful in killing cancer cells. Is this true? And if so, what potency and how often should they be taken? Any help very much appreciated. Thank you! Not likely that any of the things you mention will \"kill\" the cancer or \"cure\" him.. However some of those items, along with dietary changes, may slow the cancer down, which for men age 70 can be beneficial. However you can't count on any of them being guaranteed effective on any single patient. The reality is that with or without immediate treatment, he is likely to be alive 10 years from now. If he is inclined, he should read more and more about his odds regardless of what he chooses. He may choose to do nothing for now and then begin a treatment if the cancer shows progression. Some people are willing to take more chances than others. Or willing to postpone treatment, thinking they'll do just as well treating it later if needed. I think the report you have posted says just that. Others want to take no chances with any cancer, even if found in only one of the many samples. You can't do all the research for him. He'll have to take the time and make his own call. Diet and a few supplements are at best a weak tool, but I would not entirely ignore them. BTW, the same dietary changes that are thought to be good for prostate cancer, are also good for the heart and for blood pressure. His BP is rather high. Again, none of the items you mention will kill or cure the cancer... but then again most men die with some prostate cancer in their body. They just don't die from the prostate cancer in most cases. About half of men his age have prostate cancer, though it goes undiagnosed in most of them. Just have him read the book by Patrick Walsh and also read more and more.. Then he decides which way he will place his bets.",

      "Content": "Hi, a few points that may help others answer. What is your age? What is your history of PSA tests results and dates besides the two mentioned. It appears from the T2a stage that the doctor felt something on the DRE. Was that felt by the urologist or your primary doctor or both? The one sample that was Gleason 6, 0.6 mm long. Do you know what percentage of the sample that is? If that psa of 4.7 hadn't included the doctor also feeling something on the DRE, they may well have waited a while and done another PSA test before doing a biopsy. Personally, later on, after things calm down post biopsy, I might want to re-test the PSA to see if its still 4.7 or much lower or higher. What does the doctor say. After all he is the one who felt something abnormal on the DRE. How did he describe what he felt? and where it was located. Doesn't sound like you have to rush into any treatment soon. Time to learn lots more and consider all your options. It would seem like you can easily extend that decision process into the beginning of next year, but then again we don't know all the details that your doctor has.",

I asked what the doctor felt because you listed the status as T2a which normally means he feels something other than just normal enlargement. A harder area or a nodule. Other wise it would be T1c, discovered only by needle biopsy. You might ask him about that sometime. You might also find out what percentage of that core sample the 0.6mm represents. Like, 10% or 30% or 50% etc. Not knowing to much about the length of the entire sample we don't know. Look at this from a study on such... \"The mean length of 7,126 analysed cores was 14.14\u2002±\u20024.35\u2002mm. All cores were longer than 10\u2002mm. The mean length of needle cores sampled did not correlate with patient age, total prostate-specific antigen value, digital rectal examination, and prostate volume. The whole mean length of the six samples from the peripheral zone of the right lobe was higher than the mean corresponding value of the six samples from the left lobe peripheral zone (p\u2002<\u20020.001). The transperineal approach allows a greater sampling of the prostate apex than of the midgland and prostate base (p\u2002<\u20020.001).\" If your core sample was 10 mm then 0.6 would only be 6% which would be very low (meaning good) But as I indicated, I know very little about this or how they arrive at percent of sample.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by petermollie Length of cores where Tumour 0.6mm was found were 12/9/7mm. Urologist didnt comment on DRE after he examined me You show the 3 cores as being 12, 9, and 7 mm in length, but you indicated that only one of them was positive for the Gleason 6 with 0.6mm Again, I'm not exactly sure how they calculate this stuff, but normally they give a percentage, with lower being better. If its all simple math then 0.6 mm of even the shortest is less than 9%, while the other two possibilities would be 7% and 5%. If indeed that is how the math is done then all of those are very low, meaning good. Perhaps someone here knows more about the calculation methods. Of course your doctor would have the best and most precise answer for that, as well as the question about the DRE and why you were listed as T2a vs T1c All in all it sounds very manageable whether you do AS or some treatment. Certainly seems like you have time to explore all choices before deciding.",

If you have prostate cancer, you've had it for years and years, slowly growing. A few more weeks is of no concern from the point of view of curing it, should it exist.

      "Content": "Well, you can go ahead with those tests, of course. And you'll be getting back a second opinion on the slides. Probably you'll still get a Gleason 6 result, however lots of men are walking around with Gleason 6 in their prostates and are completely unaware of it. At your age, probably from 35% to 45% of men have some Gleason 6 lurking somewhere if only enough biopsies were done on random men walking down the street. However most of those men would still have a PSA under 4 or 5. You only mention that your previous PSA test was done about 5 years prior, at age 58. Back then, if you know, what was your prior history at that time and what if any previous results did you have and what were those readings. Meaning were they all under 4.0... under 2.0.... ? Any progression back then or any unusual bounces. Again, things can affect PSA readings more than many realize. In the past few years, I have had readings of 7.3 followed in six months by a 3.6 During the time the 7.3 test was taken, I felt nothing like prostatitis and I was not given any antibiotic. It just went down and I've had another bounce since then, up, then down. If my next test was 20, I'd be nearly certain it was not due to cancer but rather some inflammation related issue. However, given your 5 years of missing data, we can't know that to be the case in your situation. BUT it could be possible. Or your case could be high, but not as high as the tests indicate. It would be more comforting to know it was a 10 or 12 instead of 23. After some time goes by and before any final decision is made on treatment, I'd want to conduct another PSA test. Some have written that a anti-inflammatory is as important as a antibiotic. Ibuprofen and such for considerable time before the next test. And even then some inflammation is just plain stubborn. Though you don't give the dates, it appears the PSA tests were given in July and August. I would wait until at least October for a follow up PSA test. During that time, no DRE prior to the test, no sex in the days prior, perhaps some ibuprofen (you can look into that)... and no bike riding in the weeks leading up. Now, several of those items seldom make a high reading such as you have gotten,, but the over all inflammation along with BPH can lead to some high readings. Again you didn't mention your PSA reading at age 58 and before. BTW, back between the age of 51 and 56, I also went 5 years without testing, however my age 51 reading was only 0.8, then I got a 2.6 at age 56. A jump, but not like yours. Oh, I'm 63 now, just like you. I pay close attention to these jumps and patterns because my PSA jumps around and my one biopsy thus far came up clean. Still my interest is in this area. I might add that I have a fair degree of confidence that right now, I have lurking somewhere in my prostate, at least one sample of a Gleason 6. That reality doesn't worry me as it is the case for a good percentage of men our age. Its the progression that is important and the possible indicator of that is the PSA. Thus my focus on making sure your 20+ reading is the true reading or some blip caused by something other than prostate cancer. OK, lets see how those tests turn out.

      "Content": "Everything you report may very well be just as you detail it and as you were probably told by a trained professional. Now having said that, You have not included some important details. Your age Your prior PSA readings (if any) and the date of each one. 5 weeks is not all that long for a inflammation of a prostate to settle down. Something like 70% of all prostatitis is nonbacterial such that antibiotics don't have anything to treat. A good deal of prostatitis is asymptomatic. You don't even know you have it. You mention a DRE finding no lumps, then you describe the prostate as \"soft and mushy\". You should look up the terms \"boggy\" and spongy as related to prostates and prostatitis. Your description sounds more like boggy than normal. BTW, who did your DRE's? I'm sure it must have been done by a urologist. Who described it as soft and mushy? Your free PSA is not all that bad. Just wondering if your two recent PSA tests gave enough time for any possible inflammation or prostatitis to calm down. That could shoot your PSA up and make it remain there for over 5 weeks. Thus, if the true PSA was far lower it could make a great deal of difference in your treatment decisions. Again, we need your history. Did your urologist have all your history and past records? If, and its a big if..... If your true PSA was only 5 or even 8 and depending on your age, with 2 of 12 cores at Gleason 6, you might opt for no treatment at all now. Just saying, there are lots of examples where PSA scores drop big time. Of course, you can't do another one any time soon after having had a biopsy. You might also give us the date of that event. So lots of possible issues. Past history, dates, past scores, your age, etc. Or it all may be just as it appears but you don't want to get on the treatment train without knowing and considering all possibilities. That is why I ask all these questions. Sort of just on the chance. Have you had anyone else read your biopsy samples? If everything is as it appears, then I guess you'll need to be making a choice of treatment given that level of PSA. But if prior PSA tests were far lower then I'd wonder what caused the sudden jump to 20+.",

      "Content": "Well, you can go ahead with those tests, of course. And you'll be getting back a second opinion on the slides. Probably you'll still get a Gleason 6 result, however lots of men are walking around with Gleason 6 in their prostates and are completely unaware of it. At your age, probably from 35% to 45% of men have some Gleason 6 lurking somewhere if only enough biopsies were done on random men walking down the street. However most of those men would still have a PSA under 4 or 5. You only mention that your previous PSA test was done about 5 years prior, at age 58. Back then, if you know, what was your prior history at that time and what if any previous results did you have and what were those readings. Meaning were they all under 4.0... under 2.0.... ? Any progression back then or any unusual bounces. Again, things can affect PSA readings more than many realize. In the past few years, I have had readings of 7.3 followed in six months by a 3.6 During the time the 7.3 test was taken, I felt nothing like prostatitis and I was not given any antibiotic. It just went down and I've had another bounce since then, up, then down. If my next test was 20, I'd be nearly certain it was not due to cancer but rather some inflammation related issue. However, given your 5 years of missing data, we can't know that to be the case in your situation. BUT it could be possible. Or your case could be high, but not as high as the tests indicate.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Hawk u. I was 54 with Gleason 8 and a PSA of 8.7 and higher so my decision was easier. Even in your shoes, I would need some very expert convincing before I decided on watchful waiting however. Well, if one can say anything was easy about it, at least the decision, in your particular situation, was more clear cut.. I'd certainly agree with your choice. However, in a person who was 67, with a psa of .7, unless there are other details that seriously increase risk ( and I know there can be), then I'd say \"active surveillance\" is a option to consider. If you look at the following study you might find it interesting for the select group to whom it applies. http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/20...porary-cohort/ Of course one is always making a bet. On the other hand, if you take 100 men age 67 just walking down the street.........and you grab them and perform biopsies randomly, you will find a substantial number have prostate cancer unknown to them. Repeat it 3 to 6 times and you may find 1 in 3 with previously undiagnosed PCa. Now we wouldn't want to operate on all of them EVEN if we knew they had cancer because we know most of them aren't going to die of it even if untreated. So there certainly is a place for \"active surveillance\" as John Hopkins calls it. I think watchful waiting......has gotten a bad name, as though its nothing more than \"hopeful waiting\".",

Even in your shoes, I would need some very expert convincing before I decided on watchful waiting however. Well, if one can say anything was easy about it, at least the decision, in your particular situation, was more clear cut.. I'd certainly agree with your choice. However, in a person who was 67, with a psa of .7, unless there are other details that seriously increase risk ( and I know there can be), then I'd say \"active surveillance\" is a option to consider.

Repeat it 3 to 6 times and you may find 1 in 3 with previously undiagnosed PCa. Now we wouldn't want to operate on all of them EVEN if we knew they had cancer because we know most of them aren't going to die of it even if untreated. So there certainly is a place for \"active surveillance\" as John Hopkins calls it. I think watchful waiting......has gotten a bad name, as though its nothing more than \"hopeful waiting\".",

      "Content": "Everything you report may very well be just as you detail it and as you were probably told by a trained professional. Now having said that, You have not included some important details. Your age Your prior PSA readings (if any) and the date of each one. 5 weeks is not all that long for a inflammation of a prostate to settle down. Something like 70% of all prostatitis is nonbacterial such that antibiotics don't have anything to treat. A good deal of prostatitis is asymptomatic. You don't even know you have it. You mention a DRE finding no lumps, then you describe the prostate as \"soft and mushy\". You should look up the terms \"boggy\" and spongy as related to prostates and prostatitis. Your description sounds more like boggy than normal. BTW, who did your DRE's? I'm sure it must have been done by a urologist. Who described it as soft and mushy? Your free PSA is not all that bad. Just wondering if your two recent PSA tests gave enough time for any possible inflammation or prostatitis to calm down. That could shoot your PSA up and make it remain there for over 5 weeks. Thus, if the true PSA was far lower it could make a great deal of difference in your treatment decisions. Again, we need your history. Did your urologist have all your history and past records? If, and its a big if..... If your true PSA was only 5 or even 8 and depending on your age, with 2 of 12 cores at Gleason 6, you might opt for no treatment at all now. Just saying, there are lots of examples where PSA scores drop big time. Of course, you can't do another one any time soon after having had a biopsy. You might also give us the date of that event. So lots of possible issues. Past history, dates, past scores, your age, etc. Or it all may be just as it appears but you don't want to get on the treatment train without knowing and considering all possibilities. That is why I ask all these questions. Sort of just on the chance. Have you had anyone else read your biopsy samples? If everything is as it appears, then I guess you'll need to be making a choice of treatment given that level of PSA. But if prior PSA tests were far lower then I'd wonder what caused the sudden jump to 20+.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by markpw2 Please help if you can! I am scheduled to have the Davinci robotic surgery performed here in So. Cal by one of the top urology surgeons in the United States in 2 months. I am told with a 0.7 psa, Gleason at 6, and stage T2a-b1 that I am a very good candidate for this \"nerve sparring\" procedure and in the hands of a world class surgeon my chances for any sexual dysfunction or real incontinence issues are rather small. I sure would like to believe this as I always have been a pretty active guy and still feel and think very young-I am 67 yrs. old but look a lot younger. I'm told that my doctor uses the newest Davinci \"S\" robot and creates 6 ports in the lower stomach region rather than 5 ports. If anyone has a similar profile and has had this procedure within the last 1 year I would sure appreciate hearing from you re:your results. Mark You need a realistic view about robotic surgery or any type. Doctors are telling too many patients what they want to hear. Especially regarding future sexual function. Their percentages and definitions are way off from what reality seems to indicate. You want a realistic discussion. Go to the New York Times IN the search box, put in prostate and Tara Parker-Pope When you find the article, read it, then read the 75+ comments. Its the August 27 article. \"I am told with a 0.7 psa, Gleason at 6, and stage T2a-b1 that I am a very good candidate for this \"nerve sparring\" procedure and in the hands of a world class surgeon my chances for any sexual dysfunction or real incontinence issues are rather small. \" This is the point at issue. I would say your chances of one of the two of those happening is 50% or greater.. Very few men say that sex is the same after surgery. The definition many doctors use is very loose. I can assure you, it is not your definition of \"normal sexual function\" like you have currently been experiencing and are used to. OK......I've not had the surgery. Read the NY Times article and all of the comments. It offers a more realistic picture. You need a realistic view. Doesn't mean your choice won't be the same nor that there is a 100% chance you won't be perfect, but......well, just read it. Also, how many opinions have you gotten? I do realize that some very low PSA scored prostate cancers can still be dangerous, but normally the lower score the better. They did the biopsy because of your DRE. Did the tell you the extent of the cancer, in each core they sampled? What were the percentages? How many cores were positive? Did you get the biopisies read by a second pathologist? you should. Many men your age might choose to watch the PCa and not treat it. In many men it is a valid option, even preferred in the minds of many. The name used for this can range from Watchful Waiting to Expectant Management. Even famous medical centers have programs for this option.....such as John Hopkins. Certainly not for everyone and much of the criteria depends on the patients situation. I don't know the details of your testosterone situation. Are you currently being given testosterone? All in all, sound like you've not had much time to learn about all this. You seem to be on a \"fast track\" for making the decision. Gosh, you said you just learned about this 3 weeks ago and you are already set for surgery. Is there something we don't know that indicates the urgency? Seems like a very fast time frame to make all these decisions when you haven't had that much time to learn. I'd give you some other links here but I think there is some rule about that. Otago",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon After prostate cancer (3 years ago) when I had DiVinci followed a year later by 33 rounds of radiation, I may have another issue that I'm not ready for. While on vacation 6 weeks ago I noticed blood in urine. Just a note on the subject which may or not be similar to your situation. My father had about 33 rounds of radiation, as his cancer was already outside the capsule. That took place when he was about age 64 or 65. In later years, as he began to suffer from Alzheimers I was taking care of him for many years. He had repeated bouts of sporadic bleeding. Sometimes it would freak me out as his urine was bright red. Other time there were just drops or smaller amounts. The biggest problem his later stages was if any clots or sluffing off would block his urethra. I'm doing all this from memory, as he died of other causes at age 88, some 17 years ago. Anyway, my point about my father is that I was told by his urologists that this was a after effect of the radiation where it damaged the bladder and resulted from time to time in irritation and bleeding. Mostly was just cosmetically disturbing...more for me than him, because he was with his Alzheimers and such. Again, many bouts of bleeding but no real problems, unless it blocked up the bladder from some greater amount being sluffed off. Not sure if your bleeding has anything to do with what caused my father's bleeding. Your treatment is much closer in time than his was as I saw the bleeding. I don't know if he had bouts of bleeding 4 or 5 years after his radiation... My caring for him was more like 17 to 24 years after the radiation. The doctors told me the damage could progress with time.. However back then, radiation wasn't as refined or targeted as you probably received.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Lumore51 One of the guys we are talking to is at Stanford, and the other isn't (but is the head of the Robotics department a a nearby hospital and a teaches for DaVinci). We will probably go see someone at UCSF as well as they also offer CyberKnife which I would like to know more about. I will post again when further questions arise and once a treatment course is established. The best known urologist at UCSF for prostate cancer is Peter Carroll. Though that may not make him the best robotic surgeon in that center. He would however give you a good sense of direction regarding surgery vs radiation of some sort, and perhaps guide you to a top notch surgeon. He is also one of the leaders in AS, but it now appears that is not one of your choices given the new MRI guided biopsy. What I find most interesting in your story is the huge difference between the two biopsies. I assume the initial biopsy was a TRUS (ultra-sound) guided 12 cores. Given the outcome of the MRI biopsy, it makes one wonder about the two methods. I looked a bit and found the following article. Seems clear that the MRI is superior, but the issue is still being debated by some. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/823847 I am curious, what or who prompted the followup MRI biopsy? Not that reality is all that pleasant in regard to possible side effects.... but it is good to see that either from your own efforts or from the doctors you and your wife have seen, that you have been made fully aware of the potential for significant side effects. Most men are not made aware of the true odds and as such there is a lot of displeasure with many doctors who don't spell it all out ahead of time. A couple of points for when you interview doctors.. surgeons in particular. When they tell you their rate of incontinence and erectile disfunction for surgical patients... something you can ask about.... make SURE you understand their definitions of each of those outcomes. What is their precise definition of incontinence? What is their precise definition of erectile disfunction? You'd be surprised at how different a patient's definition or expectation is compared to a given doctor's idea or definition. These differences often lead to post surgical disappointment if the patient has been mislead or was not given a definition. Since this is a issue with you and your wife, you can read up on it and make sure it is clear when you make your appointments. As you indicated, it can vary greatly depending on what the MRI and subsequent surgery encounter. BTW, you can often see youtube videos made by some of the doctors. I know their are several of Dr. Peter Carrol Here is one, but it is 5 years old, being interviewed in Australia. He comes off a bit stiff compared to some other interviews I've seen of him. there is Part 1 followed by Part 2. (the practice and science has changed in just 5 years, but those at UCSF are right on the cutting edge of research) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJYdK4i5xY I live in the EastBay and if I were not a Kaiser member, I'd probably head to UCSF. Keep asking around and I'm sure there are some top surgeons that some will suggest.. (if surgery is your choice)",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon After prostate cancer (3 years ago) when I had DiVinci followed a year later by 33 rounds of radiation, I may have another issue that I'm not ready for. While on vacation 6 weeks ago I noticed blood in urine. Just a note on the subject which may or not be similar to your situation. My father had about 33 rounds of radiation, as his cancer was already outside the capsule. That took place when he was about age 64 or 65. In later years, as he began to suffer from Alzheimers I was taking care of him for many years. He had repeated bouts of sporadic bleeding. Sometimes it would freak me out as his urine was bright red. Other time there were just drops or smaller amounts. The biggest problem his later stages was if any clots or sluffing off would block his urethra. I'm doing all this from memory, as he died of other causes at age 88, some 17 years ago. Anyway, my point about my father is that I was told by his urologists that this was a after effect of the radiation where it damaged the bladder and resulted from time to time in irritation and bleeding. Mostly was just cosmetically disturbing...more for me than him, because he was with his Alzheimers and such. Again, many bouts of bleeding but no real problems, unless it blocked up the bladder from some greater amount being sluffed off. Not sure if your bleeding has anything to do with what caused my father's bleeding. Your treatment is much closer in time than his was as I saw the bleeding. I don't know if he had bouts of bleeding 4 or 5 years after his radiation... My caring for him was more like 17 to 24 years after the radiation. The doctors told me the damage could progress with time.. However back then, radiation wasn't as refined or targeted as you probably received.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jebby My current issue: started having trouble eliminating stool about a year ago, added fiber pills, occasional laxative with no relief, it literally feels like there is an egg about 3 or 4 inches up, some anal leakage. Had a colonoscopy last week, two polyps removed, no other issues observed. Even with colon cleansing still felt like I was holding stool in lower colon. Will recheck prostate and PSA in 30 days, if no change he wants to discuss surgical options. I asked him about possibility of prostate causing bowel blockage and he declined, said it was more likely for colon to \"aggravate\" prostate but not the reverse??? I am not having issues urinating but emptying my bowels. Wow, so many issues going on. I'd pay attention to the theme your doctor mentioned...\"more likely for colon to \"aggravate\" prostate but not the reverse\" You wrote some troubling points... \" added fiber pills, occasional laxative with no relief,\" When I see stuff like that, all kinds of alarm bells go off. Anything could be the case, but sounds like you are trying to treat a dietary problem with pills and laxatives instead of a complete revamping of your diet.. Meaning treating it with real food instead of something squeezed into a pill. Again, there are people who can have digestive, intestinal, and colon problems even when eating properly, however for most people the problem begins with their long term diet. After that is corrected... THEN you go to the meds, pills, and such. You mention \"diverticulosis lead to 12\" of colon being removed 3.5 years ago\" So the question is... in the past 3.5 years, after surgery, how radical of a change did you make in your eating habits? Did you completely change the foods you had been eating during the decades prior to your surgery, or did you just make minor changes, hoping you had removed the troublesome colon section? Now, as I said, sometimes even on the best diets, some folks have problems, but with experimentation many find they can greatly improve their digestive and elimination problems. And as your doctor suggested, those problems may be causing your prostate symptoms. You might cure both with a radical alteration in your eating. So... what type of diet do you follow? Typical Georgia diet, or something else? How many grams of fiber (from food, not pills) do you consume in a day? What portion of your diet is from vegetables, fruits, whole grains, in their natural form. How many grams of sugar do you consume in a day.. How much meat and dairy? Oils, fried foods.. And on and on. I'm suspicious that someone who took fiber pills is not a person who focused their dietary change on natural whole foods that contain large amounts of fiber without pills. So what is up... Any really significant dietary changes you have made over the past 3.5 years? Give us a rundown of what your daily eating is like. Seems with all your problems and worries \"down there\" that you would be highly motivated. I'm not one of those who says diet will cure or prevent all prostate cancer, but your doc seems to think your problems and symptoms are related to your digestive and elimination problems.",

I know it sounds selfish of me and I'm sure it's help a lot of guys, but for me it\u2019s been nothing but a nerve racking, anxiety ordeal. My journey started with a physical in Dec 2012 where the PSA was 5.9, up from 2.2. Now 3 years later I\u2019ve had two biopsies and many PSA test, my last test number taken this week was 2.8. All the PSA test I\u2019ve had have been below 5.9. If I had of just skip that physical in 2012, look at all the trouble free days and weeks I could have spent. I'm not certain your problem was caused by your PSA but rather by the doctor feeling something during your DRE that prompted him to do a biopsy. I don't see all your numbers, but aside from feeling something abnormal, I would never tell anyone to get a biopsy based on a single jump from under 3 to 5.9 or so. In such a case, you simply wait 3 or 6 months and retest. But if something significant is felt, then a biopsy may be the appropriate course. However, after that has been examined, then I'd not get another biopsy unless something unusual and constant occurs with PSA.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Newbury6 Hello We i was diagnosed with Prostate cancer in February this year which obviously was a shock with a Gleason score 3+3=6 I considered my options of treatment, and was advised that as i am only 43 years old and had a low PSA of 1.4 that the best option is to treat it as aggressively as possible by the two opinions i received from different doctor.. Paul, your subject title \"Due to have Radical Prostatectomy in 2 weeks\" You were only diagnosed in February... Perhaps 12 weeks later you are going in for surgery even though you have a psa of 1.4 and Gleason 6. (in a unmentioned number of cores... and unmentioned percentage of each positive core) Perhaps you'll update us on the details that might be forcing you to rush into surgery before you have learned much about this entire subject of prostate cancer. Who gave you the initial opinion? Who gave you the second opinion? What is their background? Did they both stress the need to rush this surgery? Are they both surgeons? If so, how many robotic surgeries have they done.....and how many do they do each month? There are lots of questions you need to answer for your own well being and from what I can now see, there is absolutely no reason at all to rush ahead with surgery in only 2 weeks. Give us some more information. You seem confused and making decisions under unwarranted fearful pressures. BTW, what prompted the doctor to initially take a biopsy? Did he feel something when he did the DRE, digital exam, or was it only done based on your psa test? PS... Did you have a second expert read the biopsy samples to make sure the Gleason 6 was actually a Gleason 6.. and how many cores were positive and what percent of each positive core was involved?

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Newbury6 Hello We i was diagnosed with Prostate cancer in February this year which obviously was a shock with a Gleason score 3+3=6 I considered my options of treatment, and was advised that as i am only 43 years old and had a low PSA of 1.4 that the best option is to treat it as aggressively as possible by the two opinions i received from different doctor.. Paul, your subject title \"Due to have Radical Prostatectomy in 2 weeks\" You were only diagnosed in February... Perhaps 12 weeks later you are going in for surgery even though you have a psa of 1.4 and Gleason 6. (in a unmentioned number of cores... and unmentioned percentage of each positive core) Perhaps you'll update us on the details that might be forcing you to rush into surgery before you have learned much about this entire subject of prostate cancer. Who gave you the initial opinion? Who gave you the second opinion? What is their background? Did they both stress the need to rush this surgery? Are they both surgeons? If so, how many robotic surgeries have they done.....and how many do they do each month? There are lots of questions you need to answer for your own well being and from what I can now see, there is absolutely no reason at all to rush ahead with surgery in only 2 weeks. Give us some more information. You seem confused and making decisions under unwarranted fearful pressures. BTW, what prompted the doctor to initially take a biopsy? Did he feel something when he did the DRE, digital exam, or was it only done based on your psa test? PS... Did you have a second expert read the biopsy samples to make sure the Gleason 6 was actually a Gleason 6.. and how many cores were positive and what percent of each positive core was involved?

I know it sounds selfish of me and I'm sure it's help a lot of guys, but for me it\u2019s been nothing but a nerve racking, anxiety ordeal. My journey started with a physical in Dec 2012 where the PSA was 5.9, up from 2.2. Now 3 years later I\u2019ve had two biopsies and many PSA test, my last test number taken this week was 2.8. All the PSA test I\u2019ve had have been below 5.9. If I had of just skip that physical in 2012, look at all the trouble free days and weeks I could have spent. I'm not certain your problem was caused by your PSA but rather by the doctor feeling something during your DRE that prompted him to do a biopsy. I don't see all your numbers, but aside from feeling something abnormal, I would never tell anyone to get a biopsy based on a single jump from under 3 to 5.9 or so. In such a case, you simply wait 3 or 6 months and retest. But if something significant is felt, then a biopsy may be the appropriate course. However, after that has been examined, then I'd not get another biopsy unless something unusual and constant occurs with PSA.",

Or simply doing shorter, but more vigorous rides. You can get all the cardio you need in three 35 to 45 minute rides each week. I do 3 x 45 with about 15 minutes of each ride \"out of the saddle\" standing up. Thus only 30 minutes each ride on a nice saddle. Or even two such rides, with jogging on two other days. No need to stop riding. Recumbents are OK, unless you live in all hills like I do. They are so slow going up hill. Besides, aren't all recumbent riders kind of strange... nerdy with beards?

Doctors --- also recommended re-reading the biopsy slides at another lab. Re-read of slides came back as Gleason 3 + 4, which was encouraging for me. Also got the good news that the final pathology report was Gleason 3 + 3! Good to see you've come out the other side and are on your way healing. Apparently you're going to be around until your mid 80's or 90's given your father and grandfather.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Hi Nicnic: Welcome to the forum. Sorry any of us have to be here. After reading your post, my first reaction is to tell you to calm down. With a Gleason score of 6, nothing is going to happen overnight to you. Also, that one-month jump in your PSA from 6.3 to 9.7 seems suspect. It may simply be an inflammation or infection. Can you give us more info about your biopsy, specifically the number of cores that tested positive and the percentage of involvement? I agree, the the PSA jump from 6.3 to 9.7 in one month is more likely to be from something other than prostate cancer. It actually calls into question whether even the 6.3 is the true PSA level. Past PSA scores would be useful, along with dates. It is not impossible that the true normal PSA might be down below 5 or even 4 and that both the 6.3 and 9.7 are part of a inflammatory spell. At some point down the road, I'd probably get another PSA test, even if I had already decided on a treatment. I'd just like to know the true nature of the situation as I proceeded. Having a PSA of 5 vs 10 would be useful to know about even if you were going to do surgery. So, there still is the Gleason 6. Having another doctor read those slides might be advisable. See if they both agree.",

      "Content": "Rick, I thought the article was great. I know there was more, but for a local paper I thought it was extensive. I also liked the entire format with you and your wife, as well as your emphasis on having men take a second and third look at the alternatives. So often, in fact most of the time, men are all charged up on \"getting it out\". Study after study indicates that they don't get the full message with the full data from their doctors. Either that, or they only hear the good news data. Doctor's bright out look and their interpretation of what constitutes a excellent outcome often doesn't match up with patients expectations regarding lingering side effects of surgery. Most of the other articles you see around Prostate Cancer Awareness Month are just a few short quotes from a local urologist who gives out all the standard sanitized answers. BTW, your book seems to be getting good reviews.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Hi Nicnic: Welcome to the forum. Sorry any of us have to be here. After reading your post, my first reaction is to tell you to calm down. With a Gleason score of 6, nothing is going to happen overnight to you. Also, that one-month jump in your PSA from 6.3 to 9.7 seems suspect. It may simply be an inflammation or infection. Can you give us more info about your biopsy, specifically the number of cores that tested positive and the percentage of involvement? I agree, the the PSA jump from 6.3 to 9.7 in one month is more likely to be from something other than prostate cancer. It actually calls into question whether even the 6.3 is the true PSA level. Past PSA scores would be useful, along with dates. It is not impossible that the true normal PSA might be down below 5 or even 4 and that both the 6.3 and 9.7 are part of a inflammatory spell. At some point down the road, I'd probably get another PSA test, even if I had already decided on a treatment. I'd just like to know the true nature of the situation as I proceeded. Having a PSA of 5 vs 10 would be useful to know about even if you were going to do surgery. So, there still is the Gleason 6. Having another doctor read those slides might be advisable. See if they both agree.",

      "Content": "Lots of questions and you have lots of issues happening at the same time. So, from what I understand, you'll be seeing the urologist soon. Perhaps he can narrow down the problem to any of the three or more issues you mention. Prostatitis, prostate, kidney, bladder, hemorrhoid, or fissure. I'm not sure a PSA done in conjunction with that appointment will offer any solid results. You have so many issues going on which could easily bump up your PSA score at this time. The main one being prostatitis, which even if due to some infection can still take weeks or more to calm down. Often still producing inflammation even when you don't feel it. Sub acute. That plus your possible sexual activity and bike riding all adding up to a PSA testing that could easily have bumped your PSA to 2.14 See what he says, but you'd probably get a more accurate reading during your January exam. While your wife may have been a oncology nurse, she may know very little about the issues that can bump up a normal PSA to where yours was, still only slightly higher than \"normal\". Don' lose any sleep over that prior test result. ESPECIALLY in light of what you went in for, prostatitis. That could so easily bring you up from .8 or 1.0 to a 2.14 reading, not even counting the sex. See what the urologist says. BTW, if you still have some prostatitis, he can feel it when he does the DRE. Let us know what happens. Your post is very appropriate.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by GlenBLK The PSA was done after the symptoms started and not at their worst by the colonoscopist. The urologist a week later checked my tubes and said they were slightly inflamed but did not do a DRE but I had my PSA done again. I went back a month later and after hearing the antibiotics had not cleared my symptoms the urologist suggested the TRUS. . Glen, you sound terribly confused about the situation. Your posts, if they can be understood, indicate you have not had a DRE. I find it almost impossible to believe that a urologist examined you, and indicated to you that he might do a biopsy and yet he had not yet done a simple DRE. You also failed to indicate what your second PSA is. Though I'm not sure it will be meaningful if you are still suffering from a inflamed prostate. Personally if I was you, I'd slow the entire procedure down before I'd let them do a biopsy. You need to learn more about your particular situation. Either you were not told the facts or you don't fully understand them, or you are mistaken. What was your second PSA? As others have indicated, infections or inflammations can take some time to calm down. Not all of them are bacterial based and as such do not respond to antibiotics. Figure out if you did or did not already have a DRE done by the urologist. This is no small matter. BTW, before the last PSA, was any exam preformed that same day, prior to drawing the blood? For that matter what was done, if anything, on the day they took blood for the first PSA? Also what is your complete history of PSA's. Sounds like you have had 2 done, but we've only heard the results of the first one, right? Getting a biopsy is not something you want to do, like getting a simple test, unless it is really called for. And I'm not saying that just because of the pain and possible infection.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Baz10 Prostatitis is definately ruled out as my doc said when I questioned him on this, he said and I quote \"If it was prostatitis when I pressed on your prostate you would have jumped off the couch\". I absolutely disagree with that opinion. For two reasons. I've had prostatitis (a inflamation) where I not only didn't jump upon getting a DRE, but I had no symptoms whatsoever. It is called \"asymptomatic prostatitis\" in the medical literature. It can raise you PSA far more than a single point. In my case I've had it jump up to 7.4 and later drop back to 3.8 Your 5.1 is nothing much at all if one had a small inflammation that you were completely unaware of. Originally Posted by Baz10 He also ruled out any increases after the other 2 DRE's I've had in the last 2 weeks. I'd like to know more about the timing of the DRE relative to the blood draw. All in all I wouldn't give much thought to the 5.1 Your next test could be back under 4.0 and that drop is very very very common. Test again in perhaps 6 months. By all means, don't have a biopsy based on that one 5.1 test. My psa goes up and down that much on a regular basis.",

You also failed to indicate what your second PSA is. Though I'm not sure it will be meaningful if you are still suffering from a inflamed prostate. Personally if I was you, I'd slow the entire procedure down before I'd let them do a biopsy. You need to learn more about your particular situation. Either you were not told the facts or you don't fully understand them, or you are mistaken. What was your second PSA? As others have indicated, infections or inflammations can take some time to calm down. Not all of them are bacterial based and as such do not respond to antibiotics. Figure out if you did or did not already have a DRE done by the urologist. This is no small matter. BTW, before the last PSA, was any exam preformed that same day, prior to drawing the blood? For that matter what was done, if anything, on the day they took blood for the first PSA? Also what is your complete history of PSA's. Sounds like you have had 2 done, but we've only heard the results of the first one, right? Getting a biopsy is not something you want to do, like getting a simple test, unless it is really called for. And I'm not saying that just because of the pain and possible infection.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Rekon Anyways, I need to find out what does that 1.7 means. Any help will be appreciated. Thank You As everyone says, depending on your age, which we don't know, you seem to be fine for now. However, you have a unusual family history. 4 of 5 brothers and a father with prostate cancer. As I indicated before, you should really ask your brothers what led to the discovery of their cancer. What put the biopsy in motion. Was it a high psa test? If so, how high were their psa results at that time. What was their age at that time. What was the final pathology after surgery? I can't imagine having a family history such as you have and not being aware of your brothers history and facts. Time for you to learn about each one. Then you can see if and when your psa pattern arrives in a similar territory. No rush, but follow up on that task, then come back here if you like and let folks see what they think. BTW, you should have that information available for your doctor. Plainly put, I'd say your odds of following in your brother's and father's footsteps is eventually fairly significant. But there are always genetic differences and you end up with the \"other genes\".",

      "Content": "I think the following study was just released. For those with Gleason 7 and PSA under 10... or Gleason 6 and PSA under 20 As it is indicated as \"intermediate risk\", I assume those who were included in the study were not \"low-risk\" Gleason 6. Not sure, but I assume all Gleason 7's (4+3 and 3+4) with PSA under 10 were included in the group. One would have to read the study to see if the sub-sets were separated. For example, dividing the 4+3 and 3+4 Gleason 7's. Or the Gleason 6 psa 10s from the psa 19's Compares brachytherapy + additional external-beam radiation to only having brachytherapy alone. Median follow-up for all patients was 6.7 years, and a total of 579 patients Progression-free survival was 85% and 86% for the two groups. Note, that is not the survival rate. From what I understand, until now, the dual therapy was the standard for such men. Lots of articles on the study if you Google it.

Has anyone else seen a jump of 70% in their PSA in 6 months and is it likely to be indicative or an aggressive cancer or more likely to be prostatitis or some other issue? Yes, I have had several jumps of 70%, though starting from a lower base level. (3.8 to 7.5) Since both your 14.9 and 15.0 readings were so very close together, it is very much more indicative of a inflammation of some sort. Though its hard to tell why your other readings were already at 9. You seem to have something going on, but I'm told that protatitis in some individuals can be extremely difficult to resolve even over extended periods of time.",

Right, I suppose if you have 1,000 guys in Fred's position and they all delay their biopsy until their June appointment, then you might have 1 person in whom the delay might have caused a earlier death due to catching the prostate cancer 3 months later. Earlier treatment does not always mean better treatment or more effective treatment. Its all a matter of odds. I'd say if Fred gets another 4.3 psa then we can assume that is the true picture. Not everyone caught early is helped and not everyone caught later is harmed. His wanting to do another test in June is not unreasonable nor particularly dangerous.",

      "Content": "If I was on AS I would also consider taking a statin, such as generic Lipitor known as atorvastatin. Has side effects in some men, but I don't know of any sexual side effects. You don't need to take high dose I have been given atorvastatin as a matter of my regular care, quite apart from anything to do with possible prostate cancer. I had heard it could lower your PSA and after normally being at about 3.8, after two months, it dropped to 3.3 I was still skeptical but then 12 months later, it dropped to 2.8 That new lower level is not by chance. Does not mean you won't get prostate cancer, but there are several studies suggesting it may lower the aggressiveness of that cancer and/or prevent death in many. Take a look at this article http://www.pcf.org/site/c.leJRIROrEp...ate_Cancer.htm I'm surprise the use of statins is not talked about more in men with early prostate cancer. As a normal course of taking such, you will also gain some degree of protection from future heart disease, which of course, kills more men who have prostate cancer, than the actual cancer does.",

He referred me to another doctor who is a urologist and was his university professor to read the scans when they're done. The more I think about this the more I get nervous. Is this standard practice or does he expect the worst by referring me to someone more experienced? He was also discussing debulking and we don't even know for sure that it's spread yet. . It seems you may be headed for surgery. If so, be careful who is doing it. I certainly would be skeptical of a urogynocologist doing such a procedure. Of course that may not be the case since he seems open to sending you elsewhere.",

I would caution you not to get too worried even if your PSA number comes in a bit high for your age. You are taking that blood draw only a few weeks after all this stuff has been going on. It would seem that some of the recent events could impact your prostate and not give it enough time to calm down any \"itis\" inflammation. So if the reading comes in high, you should wait some time, month or months to confirm any high number. Also your prostate is enlarged which gives a higher number. (oh and don't have any sex in the few days leading up to the PSA blood draw as it could raise your PSA score) Did they tell you why they also are going to do a cystoscopy?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Arthro92 My urologist called me today. I DO NOT HAVE PROSTATE CANCER!!!!!!!! He says what I have is asymptomatic prostatitis. My uro believes that is the reason for the elevated PSA. I am so thankful! I am THANKFUL to all of you for your soothing, comforting, encouraging words. I am so THANKFUL to all of you, for all the things you taught me about prostate cancer. Saying thank you feels like it's not enough, but PLEASE know how grateful I am to all of you who helped me during this scary journey. . Great news. I'm sure it is a huge relief. Now, having said that, I must repost a portion of what I said in my prior post to your first thread. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Well, its too late for my advice, but unless there are other facts, this is absolute madness.\" \"How about simply waiting 3 more months and retesting the PSA... Again, perhaps there is something here that is not mentioned, but reacting to every raised PSA result with a biopsy is madness. Easily, very very easily, the PSA could be over 5 due to simple infection, even a asymptomatic infection or other inflammation that isn't even caused by bacteria.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Too many biopsies are being done for simple rises in PSA scores that are temporary. Seldom is it dangerous to wait a few months and retest.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tomnan24 Hi all. I will not be 65 til next May. I do not currently have any insurance. Any thoughts about waiting til next year? . Where do you live? Do you live in the USA? If so, do you realize that Obamacare kicks in January 1st, 2014. There would be no reason to wait until you turn 65 in May. Pre-existing conditions will no longer apply. Enrollment begins October 1st. Depending on your state, or \"exchange\" you will be able to get a insurance policy that will cover most of the costs. Your monthly premium will be fairly low considering you'll be needing immediate treatment. BTW, the examples of getting seeds for $3,500. I have considerable doubts about anything close to that when all costs are considered. More like many times that amount, but I'm open for someone who can show complete cost appointments, seeds, and followup, for less than $20,000. Perhaps you could get the shot, then wait the 6 months for Obamacare. Cutting off 5 months from May. Look, from what I understand, even if your birthday is May 31st, you get Medicare beginning May 1st. So my idea about using Obamacare, would cut off 4 full months from that Medicare timeline. Right now, you'd probably be waiting until at least August 1st for seeds or other treatment. Waiting for Obamacare would be an additional 5 months, possibly 6 months, since they couldn't treat you January 1st. Or wait until May 1st, or possibly June 1st on Medicare, to be seen and then scheduled for a procedure. Possibly you could, with a few visits and planning, set things up prior to Obamacare kicking in. Thus saving a month or more. Given your circumstances, perhaps you could shop around or bargain, plead, and get that shot down to perhaps $2,000 or less to span those 5 or 6 months. Again, what state do you live in. Do you know all about the new exchanges in your state? You must investigate that. You don't live in California, do you? One last point. Those 8 of 12 biopsy cores. Do you know what percentage of each. (like 5% or 25% or 80% of each one) You know, lots of people wait at least half that time, even when they are insured. Meaning they get diagnosed, and take about 3 months prior to any treatment. If you planned it right, on Obamacare, you'd only be about 6 months out, or 3 months extra. Odds are it would make little difference. Odds are even waiting until Medicare wouldn't change your outcome. You have several choices. You are only a few weeks into this whole process. There is less rush than you initially perceive. That prostate cancer has been growing in you for easily 10 years. Perhaps 15 or 20 years. There is a fair chance if you never treated it at all, it wouldn't kill you. BTW, what is the rest of your health like. Weight, cardiovascular, diabetes, cholesterol, heart function, high blood pressure, anything else? Above all, you don't need a full decision before the end of July, so take some time. Explore the hormone shot path as a intermediate step. Side effects, effectiveness, etc. From what I recall, many men are given such a shot, and told to wait, so that doing seeds for example is easier and more effective. Obviously that is a normal option even in those who proceed normally without any insurance considerations. Just think, only a couple months ago, you were \"normal\" and there was no rush for anything. Chances are, there is still no rush. But you won't get many doctors to say that, because if they do so for 50 guys, in one case they may be wrong. They always err way on the side of caution.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mitchden I just received a second opinion Interpretation and Diagnostic report from Dr. Epstein from John Hopkins. He doesn't agree with the \"local\" pathologist biopsy which confirmed Gleason 7 (3+4). He said the following: \"insufficient cytologic and/or architectural atypia to establish a definitive diagnosis. Follow up is warranted with serum or urine tests, imaging and, in some cases, repeat biopsy with relative increased sampling of the atypical site may be recommended.\" Do you think I should get a third opinion or is Dr. Epstein the best? Thanks. Wow, you didn't just drop from a Gleason 7 to a Gleason 6, you dropped from having cancer to not having cancer. A good lesson for folks to see... Especially since your original diagnosis was based on such a tiny percentage of cancer. I'll bet out there, 90% of men would have just taken the first reading as fact.. and their urologist would not have recommended a second opinion. Then most would have been scheduled for treatment...surgery. NO, I would not get a third opinion. Just do what Epstein recommended... You are back to \"normal\"...",

Lots of reasons a PSA can be higher than normal. I've had readings of 5.5 and 7.5 over the past years. My last one was 3.3 No prostate cancer thus far. Don't make assumptions based on one test. A wise urologist would NOT immediately schedule you for a biopsy. He would wait 3 to 6 months and retest. You can have asymptomatic inflammation and not even be aware of it. And it can't be cured in a few weeks with anti-biotics, as it is not bacterial. Don't get rushed/pushed into a early biopsy.",

Do you live in the USA? If so, do you realize that Obamacare kicks in January 1st, 2014. There would be no reason to wait until you turn 65 in May. Pre-existing conditions will no longer apply. Enrollment begins October 1st. Depending on your state, or \"exchange\" you will be able to get a insurance policy that will cover most of the costs. Your monthly premium will be fairly low considering you'll be needing immediate treatment. BTW, the examples of getting seeds for $3,500. I have considerable doubts about anything close to that when all costs are considered. More like many times that amount, but I'm open for someone who can show complete cost appointments, seeds, and followup, for less than $20,000. Perhaps you could get the shot, then wait the 6 months for Obamacare. Cutting off 5 months from May. Look, from what I understand, even if your birthday is May 31st, you get Medicare beginning May 1st. So my idea about using Obamacare, would cut off 4 full months from that Medicare timeline. Right now, you'd probably be waiting until at least August 1st for seeds or other treatment. Waiting for Obamacare would be an additional 5 months, possibly 6 months, since they couldn't treat you January 1st. Or wait until May 1st, or possibly June 1st on Medicare, to be seen and then scheduled for a procedure. Possibly you could, with a few visits and planning, set things up prior to Obamacare kicking in. Thus saving a month or more. Given your circumstances, perhaps you could shop around or bargain, plead, and get that shot down to perhaps $2,000 or less to span those 5 or 6 months. Again, what state do you live in. Do you know all about the new exchanges in your state? You must investigate that. You don't live in California, do you? One last point. Those 8 of 12 biopsy cores. Do you know what percentage of each. (like 5% or 25% or 80% of each one) You know, lots of people wait at least half that time, even when they are insured. Meaning they get diagnosed, and take about 3 months prior to any treatment. If you planned it right, on Obamacare, you'd only be about 6 months out, or 3 months extra. Odds are it would make little difference. Odds are even waiting until Medicare wouldn't change your outcome. You have several choices. You are only a few weeks into this whole process. There is less rush than you initially perceive. That prostate cancer has been growing in you for easily 10 years. Perhaps 15 or 20 years. There is a fair chance if you never treated it at all, it wouldn't kill you. BTW, what is the rest of your health like. Weight, cardiovascular, diabetes, cholesterol, heart function, high blood pressure, anything else? Above all, you don't need a full decision before the end of July, so take some time. Explore the hormone shot path as a intermediate step. Side effects, effectiveness, etc. From what I recall, many men are given such a shot, and told to wait, so that doing seeds for example is easier and more effective. Obviously that is a normal option even in those who proceed normally without any insurance considerations. Just think, only a couple months ago, you were \"normal\" and there was no rush for anything. Chances are, there is still no rush. But you won't get many doctors to say that, because if they do so for 50 guys, in one case they may be wrong. They always err way on the side of caution.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by blank 3500$ was a guess based on looking at my bills but there is little doubt it is the cheapest of all procedures I am aware of. I have no idea where your procedure and associated treatment were performed. Look at this, from 2002, over eleven years ago, from the Journal of Urology. \"RESULTS: (USBT = brachytherapy) The mean total charges for USBT ($26,320) and RP ($22,660) were not significantly different. Compared with RP, USBT incurred significantly lower operating room time cost ($628 for USBT versus (2093 for RP, P <0.05). The average cost of seeds for USBT was $6184, which resulted in higher technical costs for USBT than for RP ($12,209 versus $7746, P <0.05). This was offset by lower professional fees for USBT ($7575 versus $9531). The ratio of charge to cost was lower for USBT than for RP (2.2 versus 3.0).\" That is in 2002, already $26,000. Or this one, giving only 2010 Medicare reimbursement rates (Medicare pays only a fraction of normal costs)... at $12,000 Looking around the internet, it would seem more like a figure of $35,000 in 2013. I have no idea what your $3,500 figure represents. You can't walk through the front door of most hospitals for $3,500 these days. Heck, I recently did a nuclear stress test... walk on a treadmill, they shoot some radioactive stuff in your vein and then take a spect gamma ray image of your heart. A very typical procedure between a typical treadmill test and a angiogram. (BTW, my test was A-OK) Anyway, that test, non-invasive, was billed at $5,600 of which I paid $50. But still, the thought of a $3,500 brachytherapy seems impossible, even using Medicare rate reimbursements.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ddayglo Immediately following my surgery, I added as much fiber as possible to by diet.... And I believe I've recommended it to a few members of our \"club\". Right after surgery, stool softener, absolutely. Some fiber, absolutely. But \"plenty of fiber\", now I'm not so sure.. Increasing your fiber slowly... absolutely. Ideally a individual would begin slowly increasing fiber years ahead of time. It a good idea in that it directs you into eating foods that are healthy without \"adding\" fiber via artificial means. Best to get fiber from real food. For those who are following a rising psa, and possible negative biopsies, you might assume that in a few years you may want surgery, so start now eating right. Then for those who get a positive biopsy and are thinking about surgery, begin now to transition to higher fiber foods. Most men will have two months prior to surgery, by which time your system will be acclimated to the diet. Sudden large increases in fiber is normally not recommended for anyone, pre surgery, post surgery, or any time. BTW someone mentioned that fiber filled foods contain lots and calories and can lead weight gain. Actually the opposite is true. The fiber itself has a low amount of carbs relative to the fiber and calories involved. That \"carb\" idea is part of the recent trend/fad concept surrounding the \"low-carb\" and \"paleo\" diet mania. I know of no sensible or healthy diet that would avoid fiber. Though most men here are already well into diagnosis and treatment, as a general rule, they ought to be aiming for and advising friends to follow a diet more in line with that found at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (San Francisco) http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon My mother was a dietician, I was brought up on a low fat diet, we seldom had red meat and I ate copious amounts of vegetables, almonds, walnuts and fruit. Guess what?..I got prostate cancer. So if you don't mind I'll skip the rest of this post. Well the original post was specifically about fiber. However if you give me a choice of great diet or great genetics and I'll take great genetics every time. I have a much better lifestyle and diet than my older brother yet his psa remains at less than 1.0 while mine dances around 4.0. My father had prostate cancer and clearly I got some portion of that genetic package while my brother did not. The fact that you ate a great diet and got prostate cancer doesn't make me want to throw out the outlook and advice from some of those major cancer centers. More importantly, as I mentioned and always mention, that while the dietary changes may only have a weak influence on any given individual's outcome regarding prostate cancer, it has a much more proven effect on their heart health and in most men that is a much more likely problem than is prostate cancer regarding longevity. So I see it as wise choice even if it does little to alter one's specific prostate cancer course. Heart disease, and or diabetes will affect a the majority of men on this site to one degree or another. If the dietary changes influence the progression of prostate cancer that is a added bonus. Just so I'm not misunderstood. Regarding prostate cancer, diet is a tool, but a weak tool to alter outcomes. I choose to take advantage of that tool and go with the odds that it may help, alter, or slow, progression. Hardly proclaiming it as a magic bullet, especially after diagnosis.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by blank 3500$ was a guess based on looking at my bills but there is little doubt it is the cheapest of all procedures I am aware of. I have no idea where your procedure and associated treatment were performed. Look at this, from 2002, over eleven years ago, from the Journal of Urology. \"RESULTS: (USBT = brachytherapy) The mean total charges for USBT ($26,320) and RP ($22,660) were not significantly different. Compared with RP, USBT incurred significantly lower operating room time cost ($628 for USBT versus (2093 for RP, P <0.05). The average cost of seeds for USBT was $6184, which resulted in higher technical costs for USBT than for RP ($12,209 versus $7746, P <0.05). This was offset by lower professional fees for USBT ($7575 versus $9531). The ratio of charge to cost was lower for USBT than for RP (2.2 versus 3.0).\" That is in 2002, already $26,000. Or this one, giving only 2010 Medicare reimbursement rates (Medicare pays only a fraction of normal costs)... at $12,000 Looking around the internet, it would seem more like a figure of $35,000 in 2013. I have no idea what your $3,500 figure represents. You can't walk through the front door of most hospitals for $3,500 these days. Heck, I recently did a nuclear stress test... walk on a treadmill, they shoot some radioactive stuff in your vein and then take a spect gamma ray image of your heart. A very typical procedure between a typical treadmill test and a angiogram. (BTW, my test was A-OK) Anyway, that test, non-invasive, was billed at $5,600 of which I paid $50. But still, the thought of a $3,500 brachytherapy seems impossible, even using Medicare rate reimbursements.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ezzo Could you shed any light on why I havent been given a final diagnosis? If i knew for sure that it was BPH then i would be happy to manage my lifestyle around it but all this talk of PSA cancer tests has really upset me and made the whole thing seem very serious, makes me cry with worry. If its just an enlarged prostrate due to ageing (im 43) then why test for cancer? Final diagnosis? You told us they were going to do a cystoscopy in 6 weeks. They've got everything working, but I imagine its routine to do a look inside to see if everything is fine. Goodness you were just in the hospital for 5 days. That was a EVENT. That they are waiting 6 weeks sound like its routine, to make sure. Then you'll get your \"final diagnosis\" as to what caused your extreme problem and hospitalization. The PSA is just a side issue. Loads of people get a routine baseline PSA test in their 40's, even when they've gone through nothing like you have. That is nothing to get concerned about. You are putting too much into getting that test. When they get you into their office and care, they check everything in that area that might have anything to do with anything. Ending that investigation by doing the cystoscopy. You seem incorrectly to be thinking the doctor felt or saw something. All he said was your prostate was enlarged. \"all this talk of PSA cancer tests has really upset me and made the whole thing seem very serious\" Who, other than you, is talking about prostate cancer? Did the doctor suggest he suspects prostate cancer? If you come to a prostate cancer forum and ask about prostate cancer then for sure you're going to get the entire range of possibilities, but unless your doctor said something, then all the talk here means nothing about it being probable any more than it would be in any guy with a larger prostate. Which is not very probable. But you can worry for 2 weeks. Get the test, then come back with the results.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ezzo Im just worried that my prostrate has enlarged intially in the firstplace due to cancer or is this not possible?. I had a DRE and the doctor says my prostrate is on the larger side at 41cc. Im worried that it could be cancer otherwise why would i be getting sent for a PSA. Is there another reason they want a PSA done? Im also having a cystoscopy done in 6 weeks You have a lot of things going on. You are jumping to conclusions. From what you indicated your doctor \"estimated\" your prostate size only from the DRE. That is not a very accurate method. I would caution you not to get too worried even if your PSA number comes in a bit high for your age. You are taking that blood draw only a few weeks after all this stuff has been going on. It would seem that some of the recent events could impact your prostate and not give it enough time to calm down any \"itis\" inflammation. So if the reading comes in high, you should wait some time, month or months to confirm any high number. Also your prostate is enlarged which gives a higher number. (oh and don't have any sex in the few days leading up to the PSA blood draw as it could raise your PSA score) Did they tell you why they also are going to do a cystoscopy?",

Perhaps there is something in your pudendal neuralgia diagnosis that calls for such, but with your history, frequent testing for psa jumps seems to be inviting unnecessary further exploration... either MRI or even a biopsy, when simply waiting a few more months might very possibly bring your psa back to its normal level.

It would not be surprising to see your next PSA test come in lower than 4.3. I've been up over 7 and my last one was 2.8. Several times over 4 and 5 with the top at 7.5 as I recall. One negative biopsy at about your same PSA level. It was negative but I have little doubt it could have returned results similar to yours if it just hit the right spots. Then I'd be a \"cancer\" patient instead of a non-cancer patient. Disconcerting I'm sure. BTW, I just turned 66.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rwewpar4 I recently purchase a penile vacuum pump to try and deal with the ED. I discussed this with my wife and she wasn\u2019t certain that she was comfortable with the idea of artificially achieving an erection. She said that she may need to talk to a councilor. I was so taken aback with her statement and the fact that she would not help me to work through these various issues. Still Frustrated Not sure if she is uncomfortable with the \"machine\" aspect of the device...and/or if it is done in her presence, or if just the overall concept of using something artificial is the problem. Because, after all, tens of millions of men, young and old, are using little pills to achieve somewhat artificial results. Viagra, Cialis, etc. If the machine aspect is the problem, then perhaps the better direction to go is with injections. I have a close friend who, after surgery, has used that method and now finds it routine, dependable, easy, and enjoyable. Its almost as easy as putting on a condom once you get over the unease, mostly psychological, of injecting yourself. Perhaps someone here who is using that method, can comment. BTW, you wouldn't have to do it in the presence of your wife. The entire episode of your illness and surgery is probably also difficult for her. I think it would help if she did go to a councilor that might get to the main problem, which even she may not fully be aware of.",

I had a DRE and the doctor says my prostrate is on the larger side at 41cc. Im worried that it could be cancer otherwise why would i be getting sent for a PSA. Is there another reason they want a PSA done? Im also having a cystoscopy done in 6 weeks You have a lot of things going on. You are jumping to conclusions. From what you indicated your doctor \"estimated\" your prostate size only from the DRE. That is not a very accurate method. I would caution you not to get too worried even if your PSA number comes in a bit high for your age. You are taking that blood draw only a few weeks after all this stuff has been going on. It would seem that some of the recent events could impact your prostate and not give it enough time to calm down any \"itis\" inflammation. So if the reading comes in high, you should wait some time, month or months to confirm any high number. Also your prostate is enlarged which gives a higher number. (oh and don't have any sex in the few days leading up to the PSA blood draw as it could raise your PSA score) Did they tell you why they also are going to do a cystoscopy?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ddayglo Immediately following my surgery, I added as much fiber as possible to by diet.... And I believe I've recommended it to a few members of our \"club\". Right after surgery, stool softener, absolutely. Some fiber, absolutely. But \"plenty of fiber\", now I'm not so sure.. Increasing your fiber slowly... absolutely. Ideally a individual would begin slowly increasing fiber years ahead of time. It a good idea in that it directs you into eating foods that are healthy without \"adding\" fiber via artificial means. Best to get fiber from real food. For those who are following a rising psa, and possible negative biopsies, you might assume that in a few years you may want surgery, so start now eating right. Then for those who get a positive biopsy and are thinking about surgery, begin now to transition to higher fiber foods. Most men will have two months prior to surgery, by which time your system will be acclimated to the diet. Sudden large increases in fiber is normally not recommended for anyone, pre surgery, post surgery, or any time. BTW someone mentioned that fiber filled foods contain lots and calories and can lead weight gain. Actually the opposite is true. The fiber itself has a low amount of carbs relative to the fiber and calories involved. That \"carb\" idea is part of the recent trend/fad concept surrounding the \"low-carb\" and \"paleo\" diet mania. I know of no sensible or healthy diet that would avoid fiber. Though most men here are already well into diagnosis and treatment, as a general rule, they ought to be aiming for and advising friends to follow a diet more in line with that found at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (San Francisco) http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon OTAGO...If you reread my comment I doubt you will even see the word \"calories\" plus the take away for most people is that my doctor said to stick with a \"well balanced diet\" based on Recommended Daily Average for types of foods as I have always done. He did not want me dramatically adding fibre for any reason. He did reco. short term use of a stool softener if needed. \"Fiber contains a lot of carbs which can lead to weight gain unless you are quite active and burning the calories. \" You might re-read your comment. The carb--> weight gain idea has really gotten a bit out of hand recently, such that even non-processed whole foods which happen to have fiber are being thrown into the hopper as being little different than Wonder Bread or Twinkies. As to \"dramatically\" changing one's diet in the month(s) leading up to surgery, I agree that may be problematic and unwise. However a gradual change to higher fiber in most men who lack adequate fiber (the norm) I would think would be welcomed by most doctors. Above all, not suddenly loading up on fiber the days following surgery as was mentioned in the original post. Slowly increasing fiber intake over two or more months leading up to surgery should not cause a problem. The term \"well balanced diet\" means so many things to so many people. We do know that most men don't eat enough fiber, vegetables, fruit, and at the same time eat too much highly processed carbs and sugars. Almost everyone agrees with that picture of the average American male. One only need visit the local mall to see that on display with 65% of men being either overweight or obese. Extra weight itself being a risk factor for prostate cancer both before and after diagnosis. Interestingly in those few prostate cancer centers where dietary changes are recommended for preventative or during AS, they follow a fairly similar set of recommendations. Not dissimilar those put forth by UCSF which a major center for prostate cancer treatment and research. UCSF http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf From John Hopkins \"The bottom line is that a diet that is low in animal and dairy fat, high in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables and healthy grains and nuts, is thought be a diet that can slow the progression of cancer.\" From Mayo Clinic http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-c...n/art-20045641 No magic in that advice. Probably much more valuable if followed from age 10 onward, which is impossible for 98% of us. I don't disagree with your doctors advice leading up to surgery. Even in overall dietary advice, doctors have no proof a given diet will alter the course of events in a given patient. Understandable that doctors won't suddenly have their patients alter their lifestyle. However if one was advising 20 year olds on healthy eating for their future prostate health I think many doctors might make some suggestions. Most of which would be ignored. Finally the dietary changes most often recommended for prostate health are the same ones suggested for healthy hearts which is a far more dangerous condition for 97% of men than is prostate cancer.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon My mother was a dietician, I was brought up on a low fat diet, we seldom had red meat and I ate copious amounts of vegetables, almonds, walnuts and fruit. Guess what?..I got prostate cancer. So if you don't mind I'll skip the rest of this post. Well the original post was specifically about fiber. However if you give me a choice of great diet or great genetics and I'll take great genetics every time. I have a much better lifestyle and diet than my older brother yet his psa remains at less than 1.0 while mine dances around 4.0. My father had prostate cancer and clearly I got some portion of that genetic package while my brother did not. The fact that you ate a great diet and got prostate cancer doesn't make me want to throw out the outlook and advice from some of those major cancer centers. More importantly, as I mentioned and always mention, that while the dietary changes may only have a weak influence on any given individual's outcome regarding prostate cancer, it has a much more proven effect on their heart health and in most men that is a much more likely problem than is prostate cancer regarding longevity. So I see it as wise choice even if it does little to alter one's specific prostate cancer course. Heart disease, and or diabetes will affect a the majority of men on this site to one degree or another. If the dietary changes influence the progression of prostate cancer that is a added bonus. Just so I'm not misunderstood. Regarding prostate cancer, diet is a tool, but a weak tool to alter outcomes. I choose to take advantage of that tool and go with the odds that it may help, alter, or slow, progression. Hardly proclaiming it as a magic bullet, especially after diagnosis.",

PSA tested was always between 2.5 and 4 depending on severity. Treated with antibiotics things would calm down and life would go on. That was until last year. Mother developed lung cancer and I Was deeply involved with getting her and my dads Life set for what was coming for them. Terrible stress level for me caused a Prostitis flare up that continues to today. I knew something was up with a 4.2 PSA that climbed to a 5.9 in 3 months. I don't know all the terms or acronyms yet but I had a 14 sample biopsy a week ago And they found in 10 % of one sample cancer on the Gleason scale 3+3= 6 I go back in 10 days to discuss this health issue. . Though you didn't say so, it appears that they gave you a biopsy because your psa went from 4.2 to 5.9 over three months. That calls into question WHY they retested your psa that was 4.2, which hardly seems out of your norm of from 2.5 to 4.0 and your age advancing. So, I am guessing with the 4.2, they thought they might give you a test... then after waiting 3 months (good), they got a 5.9 and proceeded. A jump from 4.2 to 5.9 means almost nothing. My psa tests bounce around like that on a regular basis. Top one 7.5, my last one 3.3. But lets assume that 4.2 is a true value... so they gave you a 14 core biopsy which is understandable and fine. However you came back with 1 positive 3+3=6 core out of 14 and that one core was a 10% involvement. I'm about your age and with a similar PSA background, except on my biopsy, they didn't find that one positive core sample at 10%. So, what would I do in your place? Absolutely NOTHING at all. I would wait 6 months and retest your psa. Then in one year I would take another psa and do another biopsy. I would not come close to a treatment during that year. At the very least, if you do need to do something eventually, you have loads of time to think about it and arrive at some decision. Treating it now would be premature given the facts you put forth. Good chance that on your next biopsy, they find nothing. Not saying the cancer went away, only that it was just by chance they hit it this time. Make sure you watch this video of two top urologists http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 If you do so, you won't feel the need to act on anything now. Again, in your position, I wouldn't even think about doing treatment. PS, you have ZERO genetic relationship with your wife's grandfather, uncle and mother. Don't get your prostate removed because your wife is concerned. Your prostate did not \"give up the fight\"... Rather it sounds like you are on a fairly normal prostate progression for someone your age. Over treatment is HUGE in men your age, with your psa and biopsy results. Don't feel the need to jump on the treatment train. Wait... see what develops over the next year.",

Don't get your prostate removed because your wife is concerned. Your prostate did not \"give up the fight\"...

      "Content": "Originally Posted by huntemup Thanks to all with the info and questions. Have been getting PSA for over 10 years. Only have records for past 4 years. Also had DRE at least 3 times in that period of over 10 years. 8-2012 PSA 2.4 8-2013 PSA 2.8 8-2014 PSA 3.2 8-2015 PSA 4.3 My location is WI 60 miles away from any lap scope surgery so open would be my choice. My Urologist has done many and it would be within 2 miles of home. Was planning another PSA in April. So I meant not to mean wait and see. I would continue active surveillance. You seem pretty normal to me. Such that if you grabbed the next 100 guys (in your age range) walking down the street, about 25% or 35% would end up with your results if given a few biopsies. Even without ever selecting them on the basis of a PSA test. Remember, even if you do have to undergo treatment a year or 5 years from now, the odds that it would be equally successful as doing it now, are very high. Relax, the odds are good that you'll never need treatment for other than psychological comfort of what \"could\" happen. Take the time over the next year to gain more understanding of the entire situation and the many AS programs ongoing, each using their own criteria and action. It would not be surprising to see your next PSA test come in lower than 4.3. I've been up over 7 and my last one was 2.8. Several times over 4 and 5 with the top at 7.5 as I recall. One negative biopsy at about your same PSA level. It was negative but I have little doubt it could have returned results similar to yours if it just hit the right spots. Then I'd be a \"cancer\" patient instead of a non-cancer patient. Disconcerting I'm sure. BTW, I just turned 66.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon OTAGO...If you reread my comment I doubt you will even see the word \"calories\" plus the take away for most people is that my doctor said to stick with a \"well balanced diet\" based on Recommended Daily Average for types of foods as I have always done. He did not want me dramatically adding fibre for any reason. He did reco. short term use of a stool softener if needed. \"Fiber contains a lot of carbs which can lead to weight gain unless you are quite active and burning the calories. \" You might re-read your comment. The carb--> weight gain idea has really gotten a bit out of hand recently, such that even non-processed whole foods which happen to have fiber are being thrown into the hopper as being little different than Wonder Bread or Twinkies. As to \"dramatically\" changing one's diet in the month(s) leading up to surgery, I agree that may be problematic and unwise. However a gradual change to higher fiber in most men who lack adequate fiber (the norm) I would think would be welcomed by most doctors. Above all, not suddenly loading up on fiber the days following surgery as was mentioned in the original post. Slowly increasing fiber intake over two or more months leading up to surgery should not cause a problem. The term \"well balanced diet\" means so many things to so many people. We do know that most men don't eat enough fiber, vegetables, fruit, and at the same time eat too much highly processed carbs and sugars. Almost everyone agrees with that picture of the average American male. One only need visit the local mall to see that on display with 65% of men being either overweight or obese. Extra weight itself being a risk factor for prostate cancer both before and after diagnosis. Interestingly in those few prostate cancer centers where dietary changes are recommended for preventative or during AS, they follow a fairly similar set of recommendations. Not dissimilar those put forth by UCSF which a major center for prostate cancer treatment and research. UCSF http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf From John Hopkins \"The bottom line is that a diet that is low in animal and dairy fat, high in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables and healthy grains and nuts, is thought be a diet that can slow the progression of cancer.\" From Mayo Clinic http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-c...n/art-20045641 No magic in that advice. Probably much more valuable if followed from age 10 onward, which is impossible for 98% of us. I don't disagree with your doctors advice leading up to surgery. Even in overall dietary advice, doctors have no proof a given diet will alter the course of events in a given patient. Understandable that doctors won't suddenly have their patients alter their lifestyle. However if one was advising 20 year olds on healthy eating for their future prostate health I think many doctors might make some suggestions. Most of which would be ignored. Finally the dietary changes most often recommended for prostate health are the same ones suggested for healthy hearts which is a far more dangerous condition for 97% of men than is prostate cancer.",

      "Content": "Welcome here. Good to see you aren't in a rush. Don't get locked into your views about the options until you gain some time from which to evaluate them. Sounds like you're only a few weeks into this process. A few questions. Your one positive Gleason 6 core. Do you know what percentage it was? Like 10% or 30% or 70%. I assume you had 12 cores taken. You indicated that you saw the new urologist and that he \"sent me for another PSA test\". Did he send you for that PSA test right after doing the DRE? Or was there a few days in between the exam and the blood draw? How about in the days leading up to your blood draw, did you have any sex? Just curious as to why your PSA in late January would suddenly be 5.2, when it was only 2.5 two months before in November. That kind of rise is rather unusual and not usually caused by prostate cancer. Your prior three PSA tests were not all that unusual for a guy with a enlarged prostate and frequent urination. It would not be surprising if your next PSA came in back in the 2.5 range. PSA's jump around like that and do so often. I've had one fall from about 7.4 to 3.8 from test to test. Did you get anything specific from him about what he felt in your DRE exam. You only say \"I could also tell he felt something on the DRE that he didn't like\"... What did he say? Or did he just grunt? Was it hard, or did he feel a nodule? I wouldn't jump right on the prostate removal train just yet. By all means, read the Walsh book. And look at the following video. As usual, all cases are different but its easy to get caught up into a narrow band of thinking I'm only giving you the link because I've found the video to be a calming one, giving a lower tone, less dramatic appraisal that many men can use in the first few weeks after diagnosis of a Gleason 6 with few cores involved. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 These are well known, well respected doctors in the field of prostate cancer.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ddl123161 I am 52 and was just diagnosed yesterday with prostate cancer after a biopsy I had last week returned positive results. They are as follows: 12 Core sample, 3 positive (13%, 35%, and 85%) all in the left lobe. PSA prior to the biopsy was 10.5 and the month just prior to that was 8.5. Gleason 3+4=7. One point. Don't assume that psa shift during that one month, from 8.5 to 10.5, is indicative of some rapid increase due to prostate cancer. It wouldn't go up that fast due to the prostate cancer you have. Many other things cause psa results to jump about in equally impressive ups and downs. So, don't let that make you unusually worried or rushed. Originally Posted by ddl123161 I don't like my options at this point but I am leaning towards robotic surgery. I do have a consultation for a second opinion on Sept 2. He has performed over 2000. Couple of questions I have is what should I be asking and how much time do I have to consider all my options without putting my health in further jeopardy? ! I certainly don't think you have to come to a final decision before the end of September, giving you easily 6 weeks from now. Actually you could probably make a decision by Christmas and it wouldn't affect your outcome or best choices. What I am saying is that after your September 2nd visit, assuming he recommends surgery, don't feel suddenly rushed to schedule surgery. Some might suggest you still get another person to look at those biopsy samples to confirm the 3+4 = 7 gleason. John Hopkins etc. Have you seen anyone who specializes in radiation? It would seem almost 100% certain that a doctor who has done over 2,000 surgeries will suggest you do surgery. BTW, how many of the 2,000 surgeries were robotic? That is one point you should confirm.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ddl123161 I am 52 and was just diagnosed yesterday with prostate cancer after a biopsy I had last week returned positive results. They are as follows: 12 Core sample, 3 positive (13%, 35%, and 85%) all in the left lobe. PSA prior to the biopsy was 10.5 and the month just prior to that was 8.5. Gleason 3+4=7. One point. Don't assume that psa shift during that one month, from 8.5 to 10.5, is indicative of some rapid increase due to prostate cancer. It wouldn't go up that fast due to the prostate cancer you have. Many other things cause psa results to jump about in equally impressive ups and downs. So, don't let that make you unusually worried or rushed. Originally Posted by ddl123161 I don't like my options at this point but I am leaning towards robotic surgery. I do have a consultation for a second opinion on Sept 2. He has performed over 2000. Couple of questions I have is what should I be asking and how much time do I have to consider all my options without putting my health in further jeopardy? ! I certainly don't think you have to come to a final decision before the end of September, giving you easily 6 weeks from now. Actually you could probably make a decision by Christmas and it wouldn't affect your outcome or best choices. What I am saying is that after your September 2nd visit, assuming he recommends surgery, don't feel suddenly rushed to schedule surgery. Some might suggest you still get another person to look at those biopsy samples to confirm the 3+4 = 7 gleason. John Hopkins etc. Have you seen anyone who specializes in radiation? It would seem almost 100% certain that a doctor who has done over 2,000 surgeries will suggest you do surgery. BTW, how many of the 2,000 surgeries were robotic? That is one point you should confirm.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by bobkeenan Also the urologist and an prostate oncology expert (part of a prostate cancer seminar that I attended up here in portland that included Seattle and Vancouver BC) Said that brachytherapy was big in the 90's and early 2000's but was being done less now. So because of the added side effects and I prefer to go where most of the experience is these days.... I pulled Brachytherapy off the list. . I've been reading this forum and others almost daily for many years, in addition to reading other sites often, and this is the first time I\"ve ever heard such about brachytherapy. If anything I'd heard it is more popular now than ever. Nor have I heard it described as having more \"significant\" side effects. Perhaps someone can give us a link to such opinions about trends in brachytherapy. Sounds very strange compared to what I always read. Just wondering, that prostate cancer seminar you attended, were any of the doctors who put it on individuals who actually performed brachytherapy? Very often, the doctors who do external radiation have a strong bias as to their method being superior. Same with surgeons. Having said that, your other options are both excellent and all offer you about the same outcome as to treating the cancer. Some might even include AS as a good choice since your 3 cores were about the same as getting 2 cores in someone doing 12 samples. Also your 3+4 is only 5%.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I would request another PSA test within the next week or two. So, after your next PSA test -- if the reading is still high -- you'll want a good urologist to quickly rule out any infection, etc. If this is ruled out, then it would be wise to have a biopsy. By rule out infection, do you mean rule out the inflammation that may be caused by such a infection? Fine, but how do you entirely rule out that inflammation which is the thing that would be causing the higher PSA reading? As I've stated before, inflammation or prostatitis is one of the major causes of spikes in PSA results. But the problem is that only a minority of such inflammations are causes by bacterial infections. Thus the doctor can't rule out the majority of the inflammation that is caused from non-bacterial sources even if he puts you on antibiotics. Time is more often the only thing that can resolve such inflammations. That is why doctors don't rush to re-test while patients often clamor for more urgent retesting. A retest in a week or two will not likely answer the questions regarding higher PSA caused by prostatitis. But then you say it would be wise to do a biopsy right away. Your logic on this matter seems at odds with the science. Urologists wait for reasons. They see PSA scores jumping up and down all the time. Why.... why do you imagine excellent urologists tell their patients to wait 4 months to retest? Why? Are they just trying to take undue risks?",

The psa scores jump all over the place for reasons that have nothing to do with cancer. Very possible you didn't even need a biopsy which only sets up the current confusion about what to do. Under any circumstances, do NOT do any treatment now. There is no need to rush anything. Re-test your psa in 3 or 6 months and see what it does. If it drops back down, then almost certainly you don't want to do any treatment. Millions of men have low percentage Gleason 6 samples just sitting there, and in most men nothing bad will happen.. Most won't ever know it is there and will never have a problem. Anyway, get those extra questions answered and then by all means, wait and retest your psa in a few months.... (not in a few weeks). Lastly be sure the next time you get your psa tested that no one does the \"finger\" exam (DRE) on you prior to the blood draw. Also, no sex of any type in the 3 to 4 days leading up to the test. And even stay off a bike for a few days prior. You want your next psa test to be \"clean\"...without other possible items that might boost your result. However.... even if your recent 4.7 test was \"clean\".... you can still get wildly jumping test outcomes from all manner of inflammations that are completely without symptoms.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by KPINOTT I had my PSA checked again and it was 2.54 in December. Then had it re-checked in January and it was 2.56. Hence the panic. My family Dr. said it was elevated for my age and referred me to a Urologist. The urologist was impressed with my knowledge of the disease as I had done my research and agreed with my suggestion to monitor it every year and do nothing else at that point. I have no risk factors such as race, obesity (in top physical condition), under 50, no family history etc Fast forward to this week; to my delight, my PSA was down to 2.16. I don't have an explanation but I think it might be related to the regimen of dietary and increased physical exercise. Have read a ton on nutrition and diet relating to PC and some of the common foods that come up are; tree nuts pomegranate green tea extract soy Lycopne cruciferous vegetables,to name a few I added all of these foods to my diet and started doing intense exercise 5-6 times per week First of all, you learn to not panic when your psa changes. Going from 2.54 to 2.16 or from 2.16 to 2.56 ... means almost nothing. In many men the \"ups and downs\" are far greater between tests. I have gone from 3.8 to 7.5.. then down to 3.8 then 2.8 and my last was 3.3 or 3.4. All reasonably normal variations depending on what is going on in your prostate. You can have mild or even greater prostatitis and it can be completely asymptomatic... You'd never be aware of it and yet it can make your psa jump all over the place. Just wait a while... 3 to 6 months... or in your case perhaps a year, and see where it goes. I've had two blood draws at one sitting, and due to a clerical error in the order, they did two psa tests, less than 30 seconds apart. Sent to the same lab. One was 2.5 and the other 2.7 The foods you mention are just fine. May help the prostate and even if they don't they are good for you in other respects. If you want to go all in on the diet thing, you could read the following study https://www.ornish.com/wp-content/up...ate_Cancer.pdf Exercise is good, though there is no need in terms of prostate health or prostate cancer avoidance, to do \"intense\" exercise 5 to 6 days a week. Moderate to moderate/intense 3 to 4 times a week will give you all the benefits in health without having it become a overly important component in your life. You gain very little going from 3 days to 6 days and from doing intense compared to moderate. I actually wish I had done less exercise during certain periods of my life. Example, running 3 miles, 3 or 4 times a week will give you all the cardio you need. Adding in more days and more miles will give you nothing extra in prostate or heart health. I doubt there is any study suggesting such a added benefit. Regarding \"tree nuts\".. watch out how many and which types you consume. They can be loaded with fat. And you don't want to eat too many Brazil nuts... getting too much selenium.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by kent4610 I am a 53 y/o wm who's psa went from 1.5 to 4.7 in a year, had a biopsy with 12 samples and 1 came back pos. everything else looked normal. I believe my Gleason score was 6,, I remember seeing that number on the paper but that is a blur, I will find out this week for sure though. I am also very okay with AS and again,, THANK YOU, I think I will be able to take a nap now as the stress just left my body... have a great day When you see the doctor, in addition to finding out the Gleason score (probably 6), also ask what the percentage of that one sample was involved. For example it may be Gleason 6, with 10% involved........or it could be Gleason 6 with 50% or even 80% involved. Also, if you have it, give us your complete history of PSA tests prior to the last two, which you said were 1.5 and 4.7. I find it some what odd that your doctor would have even given you a biopsy without first waiting a few months to see if the 4.7 dropped back down under 2.0. The psa scores jump all over the place for reasons that have nothing to do with cancer. Very possible you didn't even need a biopsy which only sets up the current confusion about what to do. Under any circumstances, do NOT do any treatment now. There is no need to rush anything. Re-test your psa in 3 or 6 months and see what it does. If it drops back down, then almost certainly you don't want to do any treatment. Millions of men have low percentage Gleason 6 samples just sitting there, and in most men nothing bad will happen.. Most won't ever know it is there and will never have a problem. Anyway, get those extra questions answered and then by all means, wait and retest your psa in a few months.... (not in a few weeks). Lastly be sure the next time you get your psa tested that no one does the \"finger\" exam (DRE) on you prior to the blood draw. Also, no sex of any type in the 3 to 4 days leading up to the test. And even stay off a bike for a few days prior. You want your next psa test to be \"clean\"...without other possible items that might boost your result. However.... even if your recent 4.7 test was \"clean\".... you can still get wildly jumping test outcomes from all manner of inflammations that are completely without symptoms. Watch this video where prostate cancer experts are interviewed about findings and psa's like yours. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 Watch the whole thing.. about 11 minutes... pay special attention to from 7:40 to about 8:40",

      "Content": "Let me completely disagree with all the other posts. You should follow your doctors advice and re-test in 4 months. Do not rush to retest. Retesting in 2 months is not only not needed, but is very likely to give you the wrong impression. The major causes of temporarily high psa often do not resolve themselves quickly. The most common, inflammation from prostatitis, often takes months to resolve. Even prostatitis caused by bacterial infection are often not resolved quickly after treatment. Most prostatitis is not caused by bacteria and even in those cases where it is, the time needed for the prostate to calm down can be several months. Given the circumstances your doctor has given you sound advice. Do not be led into thinking that retesting in 2 months is a better idea. Your doctor knows full well that he could retest you in two months, but with good reason and experience he chose 4 months. He doesn't want a interim false reading to further confuse the matters. There is no rush. Anything that may be needed to be done can be done in 4 months. Only in the most unusual cases would you benefit by speeding up the process by two months. Worst of all if you take a test in 2 months and it is still 3.3 to 3.7, he will still want to retest you at 4 months. It would be premature to test you at 2 months, get a similar result, and the go ahead with a biopsy. Simply jumping the gun. No, wait the 4 months as instructed. Prostates take \"time\" to calm down from many of the situations that produce higher results. In fact they often take more than 4 months. A further note. You may think you'd know it if you had prostatitis, or inflammation. Very often there are no symptoms at all. It is a very very common reason why prostates give out a false reading on a PSA test. Asymptomatic prostatitis. Google it. Regarding ---- \"I am already miserably ill from a variety of maladies - Chron's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, Hiatal Hernia, Barretts Esophagus, Severe Sleep apnea, been a smoker most of my life.\" Wow, what a witches brew of conditions. Sleep apnea, would that indicate you are also overweight? Just curious but all those conditions are connected with the food pathway from top to bottom. Given that you are a smoker, I'll assume you aren't a health nut. Have you ever totally altered your diet and lifestyle for extended periods of time... meaning fully changed for very long periods of time. I know those conditions are very difficult. I think I'd try many alternative eating plans for extended periods of time in searching for the one that would resolve many of those or at least greatly modify them. Sound like you are in a prolonged difficult physical condition. Sorry to hear that. Anyway, I'd wait the 4 months as the doctor suggests. One other thought.... only crossing my mind. You have a variety of conditions, each of which involve inflammation of your eating channel. Would it be too much to expect or think that many parts of your body are also rather prone to inflammation? Too possibly include your prostate. All that and smoking. I sure hope you are getting equally good testing of your cholesterol levels and blood pressure, with the focus on avoiding future heart disease. Remember, most men who get relatively higher (for their age) psa test, do not have prostate cancer. Don't talk yourself into that over the next 4 months.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Hammer2016 I am leaning toward having a robotic prostatectomy. I have interviewed two surgeons and feel very good about the one I have chosen. I am scheduled to have a 3T MRI on 6/20/16 and then a robotic prostatectomy on 7/14/16. I am nervous about the surgery and possible side effects, but confident this will work out great for me. Hold on...here we go!!! I can't argue with your choice of surgery given your facts and family history. I would want to know the details about the surgeon over and above \"feeling very good\" about the one you choose. Don't want to get you into any kind of second guessing, but what did you base your choice on. How he talked? How many robotic surgeries has he done? How many does he do each week... or each month? The robot has been around for about 10 years now, but some doctors have done very few.... or do them so infrequently as to not stay in top form. Were you able to discern his numbers over the past 12 or 24 months? I'll let some others indicate how many per week or per month they'd think is optimal, or the minimum, for a surgeon to stay sharp with his skills. Another point... is the surgeon a general surgeon or is he a surgeon that specializes in urological surgery, or even in prostate surgery specifically? You were only diagnosed a little over 3 weeks ago. You've had this prostate cancer for years... Given your data, there isn't really a rush, so make sure you really have the surgeon you want. Just because you've set a date in July doesn't mean it has to be done that soon. Its not like you get fined if you change the date. I just think my head would be swimming with a full overload of facts after only 3 or 4 weeks.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Popi Why would getting the test sooner than what the Doctor ordered make it unreliable? My guess, waiting 3-4 months between tests simply allows time for a significant enough change to take place. Three tests in one year, or 10 tests in one year...you're still going to arrive at the same numbers by the end. A test result is nothing more than a data point, and really, what's so bad about having more test results than what's normally obtained. . Popi, you fail to understand the issue. Sure, go ahead and get your test. Apparently you don't grasp the reasons why they wait a given amount of time prior to re-testing. Why not test every week? Do you know anything about why psa tests jump around? You have had ONE psa test. The two, close together are really only one test. If your actual PSA is 1.2 and you got your two 2.4 tests then you won't know the real psa score until you allow the conditions to calm down adequately such that the next score will have a greater likely hood of being accurate. A psa test raised by inflammation, unnoticed by you, does not calm down in a week. I won't go on. You seem intent on thinking that all data points are equal and revealing of the true picture. That is entirely wrong. I have had on several occasions a psa of as high as 7.4, turn out 6 months later to be only 3.7. Now, do you think if i had tested again in a few weeks, the inflammation that caused the 7.4 would have gone all the way down to 3.7? Of course not. So I'd get a 6.2 or 5.9 and say OMG.... disaster awaits. Early and premature followup psa testing is of little value. That is why your trained urologist tells you to wait months. He has seen your situation a thousand times.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I would request another PSA test within the next week or two. So, after your next PSA test -- if the reading is still high -- you'll want a good urologist to quickly rule out any infection, etc. If this is ruled out, then it would be wise to have a biopsy. By rule out infection, do you mean rule out the inflammation that may be caused by such a infection? Fine, but how do you entirely rule out that inflammation which is the thing that would be causing the higher PSA reading? As I've stated before, inflammation or prostatitis is one of the major causes of spikes in PSA results. But the problem is that only a minority of such inflammations are causes by bacterial infections. Thus the doctor can't rule out the majority of the inflammation that is caused from non-bacterial sources even if he puts you on antibiotics. Time is more often the only thing that can resolve such inflammations. That is why doctors don't rush to re-test while patients often clamor for more urgent retesting. A retest in a week or two will not likely answer the questions regarding higher PSA caused by prostatitis. But then you say it would be wise to do a biopsy right away. Your logic on this matter seems at odds with the science. Urologists wait for reasons. They see PSA scores jumping up and down all the time. Why.... why do you imagine excellent urologists tell their patients to wait 4 months to retest? Why? Are they just trying to take undue risks?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Uncle Bill This is my first post since 2013. I'm hoping someone can help me understand what's going on with me. My PSA count in July 2015 was 4.9, a big jump from January 2015 at 3.0. I'm very worried Date PSA age 7/15 4.9 49 1/15 3.0 49 9/9 3.2 43 Ignore the 4.9 jump. Your psa has been remarkably stable over the last 6 years. Going from 3.2 to 3.0 ..... Getting a jump up to 4.9 means nothing. Simply retest in 6 months. I have had several jumps in my psa... up to 7.5. My last two were 3.3 and 2.8 Some men have psa results that jump and some do not. The only concern is that your psa has been somewhat higher than normal for your age. Inflammation in the pelvic area, or even asymptomatic inflammation, could easily create and abnormal jump in psa. BTW, the vast majority of prostatitis and inflammation is non-bacterial, and thus not cured by antibiotics. Even retesting in September is really not giving a inflammation enough time to calm down. A 3 to 6 month wait between tests would be better.",

      "Content": "I was looking up the \"news\" on Google for prostate cancer when clicking on a article I saw one of those links to other unrelated articles. Anyway, seems in the back of my mind I remember reading about aspirin and prostate cancer, but with so many articles available, I had forgotten about this one. Its about aspirin use before and after surgery or radiation. Unsure of the precise dosage involved. Whether the typical 81 mg for heart prevention or the typical pill which is 325 mg. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...0828170725.htm Seems like at least the 81 mg might be worthwhile taking since it is also often mentioned for the prevention of heart related disease and stroke prevention. A note of caution. Anyone who is on any other meds should proceed with caution. Especially dangerous would be any anticoagulants.",

Either dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins, orDavid Boatwick at Bostwick Labs. Others may want to chime in here, as I'm not sure if it would change treatment options.. Ordinarily I'd also suggest that slides be sent for a second opinion, but in this case the initial report is so extensive that the we're not talking about small variations that might impact treatment choice. I'm not sure how much additional accuracy, if any, there is in telling if it has escaped the prostate thus far. As the doctor said, he was going to proceed assuming that some cancer had already escaped. Sounds reasonable given the psa results.",

I was curious as to whether after diagnosis you are still on testosterone shots or gels? I looked up the gist of the Men's Eating and Living Study (MEAL) for Prostate Cancer Patients and though you were disapproved, of course you can do everything they were going to do on your own regarding diet, which is really all the study was about. Actually you can do better because half of those in the study were just going to be the control group, eating a standard diet for the next two years. On your own, you can do everything the intervention group was going to do and even more, as it didn't sound like their dietary changes were over large. Have you already changed your diet or looked into the prior studies about that? Dr. Dean Ornish conducted one smallish study regarding diet and PSA increases as a probable marker for cancer advancing. http://www.ornishspectrum.com/wp-con...ate_Cancer.pdf Also another one on gene expression. http://www.ornishspectrum.com/wp-con...8369.full_.pdf Then there is the general suggested diet at such centers as UCSF (University California Medical Center/School San Francisco) http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf Those it would seem more than cover or exceed anything that was going to be suggested in the MEAL study if you were one of the intervention participants. Can it help? Some evidence it can, but every individual's case is unique. At the very least it is a heart healthy diet as well. Anyway, you'll get loads of advice for surgery here, and less for Brachytherapy, but that has far more to do with the choices people have already made, much like the surgeon you mentioned being all set to take out your prostate as fast as possible. I'd favor the Brachytherapy or even doing the AS for a while longer. I tend to think everyone who gets surgery believes they won't be one of the ones with a problematic outcome. Yet someone is on the other side of the outcome data. Here is a article I just happened to see yesterday, though it isn't new http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...0808115405.htm Just think everyone in the process of making a choice needs to understand the full reality of outcomes. Brachytherapy has its own set of problems. Neither has guarantees of cures, but your case sounds very straightforward. You'll probably be \"cured\" regardless of what you do. You may even be \"cured\" if you do nothing at all and just roll the dice. Well, I'm sure you'll hear more. I do think there is too much emphasis on suggesting that your two Gleason 6 5% cores ,may in fact turn out to be Gleason 7 after the fact, because something like 30% get upgraded in the final post surgery pathology. But allowing that type of thinking to dominate your decision process makes everyone approach their Gleason rating as being worse than it is graded. NO end to that kind of thinking. Makes it as though all choices should be based on no one really having a Gleason 6, which as we know is actually the most common grade. So some thoughts. You get lots more.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Popi Why would getting the test sooner than what the Doctor ordered make it unreliable? My guess, waiting 3-4 months between tests simply allows time for a significant enough change to take place. Three tests in one year, or 10 tests in one year...you're still going to arrive at the same numbers by the end. A test result is nothing more than a data point, and really, what's so bad about having more test results than what's normally obtained. . Popi, you fail to understand the issue. Sure, go ahead and get your test. Apparently you don't grasp the reasons why they wait a given amount of time prior to re-testing. Why not test every week? Do you know anything about why psa tests jump around? You have had ONE psa test. The two, close together are really only one test. If your actual PSA is 1.2 and you got your two 2.4 tests then you won't know the real psa score until you allow the conditions to calm down adequately such that the next score will have a greater likely hood of being accurate. A psa test raised by inflammation, unnoticed by you, does not calm down in a week. I won't go on. You seem intent on thinking that all data points are equal and revealing of the true picture. That is entirely wrong. I have had on several occasions a psa of as high as 7.4, turn out 6 months later to be only 3.7. Now, do you think if i had tested again in a few weeks, the inflammation that caused the 7.4 would have gone all the way down to 3.7? Of course not. So I'd get a 6.2 or 5.9 and say OMG.... disaster awaits. Early and premature followup psa testing is of little value. That is why your trained urologist tells you to wait months. He has seen your situation a thousand times.",

Either dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins, orDavid Boatwick at Bostwick Labs. Others may want to chime in here, as I'm not sure if it would change treatment options.. Ordinarily I'd also suggest that slides be sent for a second opinion, but in this case the initial report is so extensive that the we're not talking about small variations that might impact treatment choice. I'm not sure how much additional accuracy, if any, there is in telling if it has escaped the prostate thus far. As the doctor said, he was going to proceed assuming that some cancer had already escaped. Sounds reasonable given the psa results.",

My PSA count in July 2015 was 4.9, a big jump from January 2015 at 3.0. I'm very worried Date PSA age 7/15 4.9 49 1/15 3.0 49 9/9 3.2 43 Ignore the 4.9 jump. Your psa has been remarkably stable over the last 6 years. Going from 3.2 to 3.0 ..... Getting a jump up to 4.9 means nothing. Simply retest in 6 months. I have had several jumps in my psa... up to 7.5. My last two were 3.3 and 2.8 Some men have psa results that jump and some do not. The only concern is that your psa has been somewhat higher than normal for your age. Inflammation in the pelvic area, or even asymptomatic inflammation, could easily create and abnormal jump in psa. BTW, the vast majority of prostatitis and inflammation is non-bacterial, and thus not cured by antibiotics. Even retesting in September is really not giving a inflammation enough time to calm down. A 3 to 6 month wait between tests would be better.",

So, is this all it takes to be considered as having prostate cancer? Doctor is talking about options; remove prostate, radioactive seeds, etc. My feeling is, do nothing and keep an eye on it. Thanks! If your doctor gave any indication that he thought any of those options were reasonable in your case, I'd be looking for a new doctor. Less than .05 mm is like nothing. Here is some mention of criteria regarding 0.5 ml to 1.3 ml http://www.active-surveillance.com/laurence-klotz-md/ After you do the conversion you can see how tiny .05 mm is http://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-v...ml-to-mm3.html Sure, there may be more somewhere in your prostate, but if you looked hard enough, you'd find .05 mm in almost every guy, age 52, walking down the street. By all means, just keep a eye on it and see what happens. Here is a nice video with two experts in the field. I think you'll be comforted with the opinion expressed. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 Mean while it wouldn't be bad to follow a diet that gives you a possible edge on slowing down any progression of cancer that may exist. http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf That very same diet will help all other aspects of your health, especially heart related matters.",

I looked up the gist of the Men's Eating and Living Study (MEAL) for Prostate Cancer Patients and though you were disapproved, of course you can do everything they were going to do on your own regarding diet, which is really all the study was about. Actually you can do better because half of those in the study were just going to be the control group, eating a standard diet for the next two years. On your own, you can do everything the intervention group was going to do and even more, as it didn't sound like their dietary changes were over large. Have you already changed your diet or looked into the prior studies about that? Dr. Dean Ornish conducted one smallish study regarding diet and PSA increases as a probable marker for cancer advancing. http://www.ornishspectrum.com/wp-con...ate_Cancer.pdf Also another one on gene expression. http://www.ornishspectrum.com/wp-con...8369.full_.pdf Then there is the general suggested diet at such centers as UCSF (University California Medical Center/School San Francisco) http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf Those it would seem more than cover or exceed anything that was going to be suggested in the MEAL study if you were one of the intervention participants. Can it help? Some evidence it can, but every individual's case is unique. At the very least it is a heart healthy diet as well. Anyway, you'll get loads of advice for surgery here, and less for Brachytherapy, but that has far more to do with the choices people have already made, much like the surgeon you mentioned being all set to take out your prostate as fast as possible. I'd favor the Brachytherapy or even doing the AS for a while longer. I tend to think everyone who gets surgery believes they won't be one of the ones with a problematic outcome.

Why is it called aggressive. How often does the radiation team do this procedure and what is their record over the years? Is this some small town hospital or a major medical center?

Therefore he is recommending active surveillance. He was very clear that in his opinion this is not an aggressive situation. I\u2019m curious what any of you would do based upon these results?? Well, at the very least, I wouldn't make any quick decisions. You've only been into this current situation for 2 months and it may take 2 to 4 months before you might get comfortable with all the facts and realities. Slowly learn more while you await a second biopsy. Enjoy the holidays knowing there is no need for speed. You might get another PSA in 3 or 4 months to make sure your current PSA range is accurate. In short, I'd not do any treatment during the following 6 months. BTW, if you get several \"2nd opinions\", you are sure to find a urologist who tells you to get surgery now. Then again, to do something active for now, you could send your biopsy slides to John Hopkins for a second reading. A confirmation of the first reading or perhaps a different outcome.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by trinity3 My name is Steve. I am 58 and had an abnormal DRE, along with an elevated PSA of 3.3. So I told him I would do one more PSA and I wanted to see the free psa vs. bound psa numbers - he said ok but it was not part of what he originally ordered for blood work. I am thinking about proceeding to the biopsy sooner rather than later. Any thoughts or advice based on the information I have shared? Why do you say your PSA is elevated? What and when was your prior PSA? This recent 3.3 PSA... What was the date? If you are thinking about doing the next PSA much before the end of the year, you are really rushing it. That last thing you want is to get another PSA soon after the recent one. That will tell you nothing if the result is still around 3.3. I'd say a minimum of 3 months between the 3.3 and your next test. We don't know what \"abnormal\" means. Abnormal can just mean spongy \"boggy\" sometimes. Indicative of a possible infection rather than a hardness or nodule. Did the doctor say what he felt? It would be nice to see what your normal psa is before getting a quick biopsy. Perhaps you have more details. Under the circumstances the skilled urologist doesn't seem to feel the urgency you have.",

      "Content": "Kargok9, Welcome to the forum. You seem to have things well in hand regarding your options and the time to consider them all without feeling rushed. I was curious as to whether after diagnosis you are still on testosterone shots or gels? I looked up the gist of the Men's Eating and Living Study (MEAL) for Prostate Cancer Patients and though you were disapproved, of course you can do everything they were going to do on your own regarding diet, which is really all the study was about. Actually you can do better because half of those in the study were just going to be the control group, eating a standard diet for the next two years. On your own, you can do everything the intervention group was going to do and even more, as it didn't sound like their dietary changes were over large. Have you already changed your diet or looked into the prior studies about that? Dr. Dean Ornish conducted one smallish study regarding diet and PSA increases as a probable marker for cancer advancing. http://www.ornishspectrum.com/wp-con...ate_Cancer.pdf Also another one on gene expression. http://www.ornishspectrum.com/wp-con...8369.full_.pdf Then there is the general suggested diet at such centers as UCSF (University California Medical Center/School San Francisco) http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf Those it would seem more than cover or exceed anything that was going to be suggested in the MEAL study if you were one of the intervention participants. Can it help? Some evidence it can, but every individual's case is unique. At the very least it is a heart healthy diet as well. Anyway, you'll get loads of advice for surgery here, and less for Brachytherapy, but that has far more to do with the choices people have already made, much like the surgeon you mentioned being all set to take out your prostate as fast as possible. I'd favor the Brachytherapy or even doing the AS for a while longer. I tend to think everyone who gets surgery believes they won't be one of the ones with a problematic outcome. Yet someone is on the other side of the outcome data. Here is a article I just happened to see yesterday, though it isn't new http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...0808115405.htm Just think everyone in the process of making a choice needs to understand the full reality of outcomes. Brachytherapy has its own set of problems. Neither has guarantees of cures, but your case sounds very straightforward. You'll probably be \"cured\" regardless of what you do. You may even be \"cured\" if you do nothing at all and just roll the dice. Well, I'm sure you'll hear more. I do think there is too much emphasis on suggesting that your two Gleason 6 5% cores ,may in fact turn out to be Gleason 7 after the fact, because something like 30% get upgraded in the final post surgery pathology. But allowing that type of thinking to dominate your decision process makes everyone approach their Gleason rating as being worse than it is graded. NO end to that kind of thinking. Makes it as though all choices should be based on no one really having a Gleason 6, which as we know is actually the most common grade. So some thoughts. You get lots more. The dietary changes you can do while you make up your mind.",

I've been reading articles all over the place looking for another cause which fits my symptoms, or lack thereof.

I am currently swinging wildly between \"it must be something else, just need to figure out what\" and \"it must be cancer\". Waiting and not knowing is terrible. Just because the urinalysis comes back in normal range, does not mean that the psa rise can't be caused by prostatitis. In fact, the majority of asymptomatic prostatitis is non-bacterial.

Indeed, the odds are far greater that the cause of your jump in PSA has nothing to do with cancer. Especially given your age, and despite your family history.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Powderfinger Interestingly, my doc told me today that brachy was something that is not being done so much anymore? I forgot the reason but I got the feeling it was like becoming obsolete? More interestingly, I've read online and perhaps here in this forum that Cryosurgery hasn't been proven so much yet so many don't even consider it a viable option. But my Doc said today he does it regularly and I should consider it as an option....So I do think I have much to investigate. You definitely need to get a opinion from a doctor that is not so negative about brachy. It is very mainstream. That your doctor would say that it is something that is not being done so much anymore is absurd. Then for him to suggest Cryosurgery is what he does regularly suggests he might have more than a mild bias in the matter. This is not uncommon for doctors to tell their patients that the procedure they do is the best. Cryo may be great, but you won't find many people on forums who have had cryosurgery. Sounds like you haven't had much more than a week to really be reading about all this, your biopsy being only a week ago. So much information and so little of it gives a clear picture making a choice simple. Lots of people go for surgery with the idea that it provides a greater chance of total cure. I do not think there is much data to back that up comparing it to other options. It may be just as good, but to suggest it is better is another matter. BTW, there is surgery and there is radiation and there is brachy.... In the case of brachy some do both that and regular external radiation at the same time. You will hear lots of things about sexual performance outcomes after surgery and brachy. First of all, you need the doctor to be very clear about his definition of sex after surgery and what he defines as a erection and his percentage outcomes. This because some doctors give out inflated numbers regarding outcomes of sexual ability and urinary continence. Over all one of the biggest problems with surgery is that the patients often complain they weren't given the true picture of outcomes. This can happen with any treatment but is a more common complaint with surgery. Expressed for years, as seen in a article such as this http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/0...-surgery/?_r=0 Lots of people opt for surgery because they \"want it out\"... You've been through a lot over the years, so you may have a more realistic picture of what odds and data mean. There are no guarantees with any treatment or any surgery. Sexual ability and recovery is not guaranteed with any treatment, but surgical procedures leave many with less than expected outcomes. Here is a NPR radio discussion on that matter http://www.npr.org/2011/10/03/141014...cancer-surgery Now I don't want to give you a overly negative picture. One of my closest friends had his prostate surgery in 2007 and was married in 2010 to his much younger wife, and before and after marriage things worked out, as he used injections when needed. Not the terrible thing most imagine. They were together for years before and now years after surgery. He was 57 at the time of surgery. He has no regrets. I know another individual who was about the same age and he never had a problem or so I was told by his cousin. But as in that radio show, lots of people are disappointed in that the doctors never fully informed then about the real data of outcomes regarding sexual performance and ability. If you have not already done so you can read many more first person examples on http://www.healingwell.com/community/?f=35 and hundreds of men on http://www.yananow.org/Links.shtml Don't want to flood you with information as it can be overwhelming when you first dive in but those are some excellent sites. Also http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/treatment/ showing you a list of potential treatment options. Take your time and you'll end up with a suitable treatment and great chances for a long future. My father thought he was going to die soon, as his prostate cancer was out of the capsule and inoperable. He had radiation and died of other causes 25 years later at age 88. Yes, he did have side effects as time went on. No treatment is without the chance of those. Wish you well. Give yourself adequate time to investigate your options and to seek second opinions. Perhaps even see someone who specializes in brachy for his take.",

Therefore he is recommending active surveillance. He was very clear that in his opinion this is not an aggressive situation. I\u2019m curious what any of you would do based upon these results?? Well, at the very least, I wouldn't make any quick decisions. You've only been into this current situation for 2 months and it may take 2 to 4 months before you might get comfortable with all the facts and realities. Slowly learn more while you await a second biopsy. Enjoy the holidays knowing there is no need for speed. You might get another PSA in 3 or 4 months to make sure your current PSA range is accurate. In short, I'd not do any treatment during the following 6 months. BTW, if you get several \"2nd opinions\", you are sure to find a urologist who tells you to get surgery now. Then again, to do something active for now, you could send your biopsy slides to John Hopkins for a second reading. A confirmation of the first reading or perhaps a different outcome.",

It's still small but if it's changed its probably not 3+3. In the NY I'll have another template guided biopsy to see if it's changed to a more aggressive level than previous 3+3. I'm guessing it has. From what I've ever read, there is no reason to think that the 3+3 lesion... if it changes shape or grows, then turns into a higher grade such as 4+3 . Now, they might find a new lesion that is higher grade, but the old one would be possibly larger but of the same grade. Did your doctor suggest otherwise, or have you just assumed that as a lesion grows, it changes to a higher grade?",

      "Content": "Thought you might find this interesting. My father was diagnosed back in January 1974. I just came across his \"Anatomical Pathology Consultation Report\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --Clinical Data (what his Dr gave with the specimen) Benign prostatic hypertrophy. ?? neoplasm of prostate. Report: Gross: Specimen consists of 3 cylindrical portions of friable grey-white tissue averaging 1 cm. in length and 1 mm in width. All are embedded. Microscopic: The prostate tissue is diffusely infiltrated by somewhat pleomorphic small tumor glands. These are lined by cuboidal cells with prominent dark nuclei. Diagnosis: PROSTATE BIOPSY WITH INFILTRATING ADENOCARCINOMA. Signed, Dr. xxxx xxxxx ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, this was in the pre PSA era and pre-Gleason era. You don't get all the 3 + 3 or 4 +3 stuff. You didn't get the 10 to 14 cores, nor the percentage of each core. No ultrasound to guide the biopsy. It appears that only 3 cores were taken. It is difficult to read the report and see what the nature of his cancer was. I've looked up the terms but can' t get a fix. I heard from him that it was \"inoperable\" but don't know how his doctor might have established that to be the case. Meaning it seems his doctor felt it was already outside the capsule. Might have been very lucky for him because surgery back then was not nearly so precise or gentle. Anyway he got external beam Cobalt radiation, followed up by a form of hormone treatment. 1.0 mg of DES. Still in use and very cheap in some cases. Rarely used now. Not sure why. I've heard a few guys have still used it. It is amazingly inexpensive as it is generic. Anyway, he was diagnosed at age 63 and treated at age 64 and lived to age 88. At the end, with the PSA test now in place, his results were always 0.0 I even took him off the hormone pills in the last few years and his psa stayed at 0.0 I removed him from the pills because they were causing so much water retention and quality of life issues. I wonder if he even needed to be on the pills for all those years. However since it was apparently working, no one wanted to rock the boat,, and risk cancer returning. In his 25 years after diagnosis he did have quality of life issues from the radiation treatments. Including bleeding in the bladder and an occasional blockage of the urethra from a blood clot. Then the rush to a emergency room before he exploded. Radiation was less precise back then and there were more tissues affected. Bladder, Anal sphincter muscle, etc. Also the hormone treatments caused the usual problems and body changes. Plus, nice people didn't discuss these issues back then. Just you and the occasional visit to your doctor. No forums. All very scary and embarrassing. No support groups. Perhaps the radiation killed everything and he could have gone without the hormone treatment after the first few months. Who knows. So, that is the limited information they got in the past from a biopsy. That and no PSA number. Flying blind. Anyway, I hadn't seen this pathology report before now and thought it was interesting. Interestingly I am the exact same age as he was when diagnosed. Thus my continued interest. PS, this is about DES as a substitute drug http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22578092 http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/20...ement-of-crpc/",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Cathy792 My partner was diagnosed today with prostate cancer. The doctor told him that he is a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10.. Cathy, Well, of course we weren't in the room to hear the doctors exact words, but if that is what he said... then that is a terrible way to describe it to a naive patient. Left out of the \"6 on a scale of 1 to 10\" is the fact that Gleason 5 is not even considered cancer. Thus 6 is the absolute lowest that even qualifies. (BTW, the profession is in the process of replacing that troubling way to describe what is and isn't cancer). We don't know your partners age and that is important. It may surprise you, but by the time men reach 80, the majority of them have some prostate cancer. Mostly undiscovered and undiagnosed. In addition to his age, you might tell us why they did a biopsy. Was his PSA test result high, relative to his past PSA history? Also, you will almost certainly want to get a second reading of his biopsy samples. Some men get downgraded from cancer to no cancer. As you can see the diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer can vary from doctor to doctor that looks at the biopsy samples. You should get your partner to come to this site and give the details. Seems like right now, all that you and he have in your mind is C-A-N-C-E-R... (which most people equate with death) You should be aware that the long time statistics show that only 1 man in 6 diagnosed with prostate cancer, dies from the disease. A fair percentage require no treatment at all. Let us know more details and encourage your partner to come here and gain a view of his condition with a bit more perspective than he might get in a single visit to the doctor. Often times the patient leaves the office in a daze, only remembering the word CANCER and thinking the worst. Cheer up, he is most likely going to be around for a very long time.",

Your 3+3 is better than my 3+4 but were it me, given your age and diabetes, I would be pro-active and not consider active surveillance. Allen Well, of course we would want to know how many of the cores were Gleason 6, and what percent of each of those was involved. That would make a difference. I don't exactly understand why being 67 and having Type 2 diabetes would make anyone \"be pro-active and not consider active surveillance\" ? However here is a study suggesting that danger may be somewhat greater. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24384808 I would say this, the danger of heart attack and stroke due to the Type 2 diabetes still far outweighs the risk of mortality from prostate cancer. We don't know the details, but I'd be paying as much or more attention to my heart risk factors... diet and exercise... than to my choice of treatment or surveillance of prostate cancer.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon For what it's worth I would suggest you meet with the best surgeon and best oncologist you can find for their recommendations. Your 3+3 is better than my 3+4 but were it me, given your age and diabetes, I would be pro-active and not consider active surveillance. Allen Well, of course we would want to know how many of the cores were Gleason 6, and what percent of each of those was involved. That would make a difference. I don't exactly understand why being 67 and having Type 2 diabetes would make anyone \"be pro-active and not consider active surveillance\" ? However here is a study suggesting that danger may be somewhat greater. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24384808 I would say this, the danger of heart attack and stroke due to the Type 2 diabetes still far outweighs the risk of mortality from prostate cancer. We don't know the details, but I'd be paying as much or more attention to my heart risk factors... diet and exercise... than to my choice of treatment or surveillance of prostate cancer. To include a huge emphasis on getting any possible excess weight off via the diet and exercise even though the type 2 may be controlled with meds in some.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Jack1954! In your case, even with pristine surgical results, most MDs will recommend Adjuvant or Salvage Radiation for G9 PC. So you are suggesting that almost anyone with G9 will have radiation recommended regardless of the post surgical findings. In this case, Jack1954 has said that two of his biopsy samples were as follows \"And 2 cores shows 100% cancer entire tissue.(these core were taken from the left peripheral zone which was highlighted in the MRI as heterogeneous signal and also during the TRUS biopsy) \" Given what you say about most MDs recommending radiation...just in case..., then why even do the surgery if you are going to do the radiation regardless. Does that suggest that radiation is \"iffy\" as to its ability to destroy the cancer inside the prostate? Such that it is better to remove it? Seems if radiation is almost certain, then why do the surgery? I don't know the answer to this, as this is not a topic I have looked into.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Cathy792 My partner was diagnosed today with prostate cancer. The doctor told him that he is a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10.. Cathy, Well, of course we weren't in the room to hear the doctors exact words, but if that is what he said... then that is a terrible way to describe it to a naive patient. Left out of the \"6 on a scale of 1 to 10\" is the fact that Gleason 5 is not even considered cancer. Thus 6 is the absolute lowest that even qualifies. (BTW, the profession is in the process of replacing that troubling way to describe what is and isn't cancer). We don't know your partners age and that is important. It may surprise you, but by the time men reach 80, the majority of them have some prostate cancer. Mostly undiscovered and undiagnosed. In addition to his age, you might tell us why they did a biopsy. Was his PSA test result high, relative to his past PSA history? Also, you will almost certainly want to get a second reading of his biopsy samples. Some men get downgraded from cancer to no cancer. As you can see the diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer can vary from doctor to doctor that looks at the biopsy samples. You should get your partner to come to this site and give the details. Seems like right now, all that you and he have in your mind is C-A-N-C-E-R... (which most people equate with death) You should be aware that the long time statistics show that only 1 man in 6 diagnosed with prostate cancer, dies from the disease. A fair percentage require no treatment at all. Let us know more details and encourage your partner to come here and gain a view of his condition with a bit more perspective than he might get in a single visit to the doctor. Often times the patient leaves the office in a daze, only remembering the word CANCER and thinking the worst. Cheer up, he is most likely going to be around for a very long time.",

I also think it is crazy, given the huge number of people with typical heart disease.

Notice the lessening of the blue lipid pool(s) as you blow up Figure 2 http://www.journalofcardiologycases....2811%2900025-9 There are lots of reasons to think you can greatly stabilize those regions that are most prone to rupture and thrombosis, over a period of a few months. Not reversal, but stabilization in the shorter term.",

That's crazy to me, considering how widespread Heart disease is in the developed world. Like you, I've come across no heart forum comparable to this prostate cancer forum. I also think it is crazy, given the huge number of people with typical heart disease. I see you found the HW forum, but as I visit it every few months, I find it fairly useless for the typical traditional heart disease subject. So many other forums are dead or have infrequent and old replies. I'll keep looking and perhaps someone here will tell us about something We have missed.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sarg This isn't really about prostate cancer. This is American Heart Month. Just a reminder if you have any sort of chest pain, go get checked out! I had the pain for awhile and didn't get it checked until a couple of weeks ago. I just got out of the hospital yesterday after a quadruple bypass. So pay attention to your body. It is scary as hell going in for a bypass surgery. Sarg, good to hear you are on the mend. Its been a eventful 3 years in your health. Prostate cancer surgery (with a great doctor) and now quadruple bypass...(that seems to have been done well also). I just want to add a bit of what Pratoman has come around to understand. Your combination of genes and lifestyle brought the heart condition to a danger point, and despite your new plumbing, the same process will continue unless you radically alter your lifestyle. They bypassed the 4 dangerous areas, but the process is system wide and will come back again, either in other areas or in the new plumbing unless you make some fairly drastic changes. Just taking the meds... including a statin... will not do the job by itself. I would agree with Pratoman that you, from this point forward, look into altering your diet in a manner similar to that which Dr. Dean Ornish advises. There are several similar doctors, but he is one of the best known ones. Former president Bill Clinton underwent a multiple bypass and then only moderately changed his diet. A few years later his bypasses were closing up. They had to put stents in his bypassed arteries. From that point forward Clinton went the whole 9 yards and did the nearly complete alteration of his diet with the help of Dr. Ornish and Dr. Esselstyn. Thus far he has been doing well and now considers his new diet...along with the meds... part of normal every day living. I would only advise that you not follow his original path of waiting until the bypass needed new procedures. Often times cardiologists will not lead you in this direction. Not because they don't believe it is healthy, but rather because they believe (with good reason), that very few patients will follow through. Up to you.... but if you have not already done so, begin studying these alternative ways of eating. Books, videos,, the information is out there on a largely plant based way of eating. Some will insist it isn't proven for everyone.... the general population. But you are not everyone. You are a person with a proven susceptibility to coronary artery disease. OK... I realize you are in your very first days... Just past a HUGE major hurdle. I normally wouldn't lay all this on someone right away, but in a few weeks, this thread will be old and history. Too late for me to give my advice. I now eat this way, and also take my meds, including statin. You and I are the same age. You have been through so much, I wish that your future is filled with far less drama and many good healthy years.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ray61 Well this was a surprise. Newly diagnosed Jan 9th. 3+3=6 gleason with PNI. 24 cores done, only one confirmed PC, the others showed atypical cells. My urologist recommended prostatectomy or radiation. I want it out. Have an appointment at Shands with Dr Su who is supposed to be pretty good with the robot. Look forward to getting info from this site. Goodness, SLOW DOWN.. What is your most recent psa and psa history? What is your age? How many biopsies have you had prior to this one? Why in the world did they do a 24 core biopsy? Are you really sure that you had 1 core at 3+3=6 and ALL of the other 23 were found with atypical cells? I've never heard of such a report. Not saying it isn't possible, only very unusual. That one positive core, what percentage was involved? (like 10% or 40%... etc.) Have you had a second opinion reading of those 24 samples? Any family history of prostate cancer? If so, what outcome? Its a natural reaction to say \"I want it out\"... but remind yourself, its been sitting there for years, not just a few months. In most cases its growing very slowly. You'd do well, depending on those other questions I raised, to take a good deal of time to understand the situation and to consider your options. Unless there is important information you left out, you could take 6 months or a year to make a decision and not likely affect the outcome of your case.",

I told the nurse I had severe pain (the doc was never accessible) and she said it is normal to have pain after the surgery up to 6 weeks so I suffered the pain until the follow-up. When I told my surgeon I still have severe pain and can't even walk normally he was surprised. You cannot listen to the \"gatekeepers\". If you are in real pain you need to plant yourself in the doctors office and refuse to leave. Nurses hear about pain on every call. They lump all pain into one box. If needed exaggerate... or at the very least be very precise. Remember, when that nurse gets off the phone, she is not feeling any of your pain.... and the doctor never hears about it at all. Physical presence in the doctors office... right at the desk or window.... Harder for them to ignore a body right in front of them who refuses to leave.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by dmcook695 Hello all! My head is in a tailspin as I was just told late last night that my father was going in for a biopsy this morning and has ended up with a dx of probable prostate cancer. Basically the surgeon told my mother that we need to wait until Wed. for the biopsy results but the tissue did not look good. He said he did a very slight TURP to give him a little relief but wanted to handle the tissue as little as possible. My brother who is an MD and mother who is a nurse said they will both be shocked if biopsy comes back negative. My dad is 79 and generally healthy but has a history of BPH and has had ongoing symptoms of this, just worsening over the last 6 weeks. Any thoughts? Wednesday seems like an eternity away at this point! Thanks! As indicated, you will know very little until the biopsy results come back. Wednesday would be a very rapid turnaround. If he gets diagnosed with prostate cancer, unless it is very aggressive, he is unlikely to die from the disease. At his age he will most likely outlast the disease and die from other \"natural\" causes. And you should know the following. If you were to closely examine 100 men his age, half of them would have some prostate cancer, undiscovered in most cases. It is almost normal to have some prostate cancer by age 79. For most, it will go undiagnosed and untreated, never threatening their life. You can just wait and see... Report back and let us know what the biopsy reveals.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman In the spirit of looking for something new to worry about when it doesn't yet exist, I went to the various nomogram tools on the MSKCC, Johns Hopkins, and Cleveland Clinic websites, and input my pathology stats. What I found was all three showing a 99% 15 year PC specific survival rate. However when it came to 2, 5, 7, and 10 year Biochemical recurrence free rate, the numbers for 10 year where in the low 90% range, on the CC and JH Nomograms, but 81% on the MSKCC website. Anybody have any thoughts on this? . How would the biochemical recurrence free rate for you.... of from 81% to 90%.... stack up with the average 64 year old man's \"occurrence rate\" walking down the street, never having been diagnosed in the first place. Given that 1 out of 6 such men will be diagnosed, it would seem like that man chances are about the same as yours at about 16%. You at from 10% to 19%.",

Not sure which type of doctor gave you that first choice. There may be in your area, doctors who specialize in prostate radiation treatment as opposed to general radiation treatment. I don't know, but in any case, you'd be wise to get a second opinion on the case. Also find out how many treatments the treating radiologist has performed on prostate cancers. As with surgery, the experience of the doctor and the treatment center team, are very important. I'm not well versed on radiation, except to know there are different types and courses in various treatments. I'd want to know why one type is being chosen vs another type. Thus the need for a second opinion. Which may only confirm the first choice. BTW, my father had radiation for prostate cancer at age 63 and lived until age 88, dying of other causes.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by dmcook695 Hello all! My head is in a tailspin as I was just told late last night that my father was going in for a biopsy this morning and has ended up with a dx of probable prostate cancer. Basically the surgeon told my mother that we need to wait until Wed. for the biopsy results but the tissue did not look good. He said he did a very slight TURP to give him a little relief but wanted to handle the tissue as little as possible. My brother who is an MD and mother who is a nurse said they will both be shocked if biopsy comes back negative. My dad is 79 and generally healthy but has a history of BPH and has had ongoing symptoms of this, just worsening over the last 6 weeks. Any thoughts? Wednesday seems like an eternity away at this point! Thanks! As indicated, you will know very little until the biopsy results come back. Wednesday would be a very rapid turnaround. If he gets diagnosed with prostate cancer, unless it is very aggressive, he is unlikely to die from the disease. At his age he will most likely outlast the disease and die from other \"natural\" causes. And you should know the following. If you were to closely examine 100 men his age, half of them would have some prostate cancer, undiscovered in most cases. It is almost normal to have some prostate cancer by age 79. For most, it will go undiagnosed and untreated, never threatening their life. You can just wait and see... Report back and let us know what the biopsy reveals.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ray61 Well this was a surprise. Newly diagnosed Jan 9th. 3+3=6 gleason with PNI. 24 cores done, only one confirmed PC, the others showed atypical cells. My urologist recommended prostatectomy or radiation. I want it out. Have an appointment at Shands with Dr Su who is supposed to be pretty good with the robot. Look forward to getting info from this site. Goodness, SLOW DOWN.. What is your most recent psa and psa history? What is your age? How many biopsies have you had prior to this one? Why in the world did they do a 24 core biopsy? Are you really sure that you had 1 core at 3+3=6 and ALL of the other 23 were found with atypical cells? I've never heard of such a report. Not saying it isn't possible, only very unusual. That one positive core, what percentage was involved? (like 10% or 40%... etc.) Have you had a second opinion reading of those 24 samples? Any family history of prostate cancer? If so, what outcome? Its a natural reaction to say \"I want it out\"... but remind yourself, its been sitting there for years, not just a few months. In most cases its growing very slowly. You'd do well, depending on those other questions I raised, to take a good deal of time to understand the situation and to consider your options. Unless there is important information you left out, you could take 6 months or a year to make a decision and not likely affect the outcome of your case.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Drbbt Hello everyone. I'd like to say that I am happy to be here, but I will say that I am happy that this forum is here. This is my first post, but I've been helped immensely by what I have found here already. I found out that I have PCa on July 22nd, just 4 days before my 48th birthday. I was not new to urology as I began having occasional bouts of prostatitis back in my early 30s. My PSA had fluctuated a bit over the past 5 years, but had never gone above 2.5 and had always settled back down. Couple of years ago it climbed to 2.6 and created some anxiety for me. We retested and it dropped to 1.7. For the next year, I forgot that I even had a prostate. Then it shot up to 4.2 (!!!) a year later. Based my history of chronic prostatitis and years of fluctuations, my doctor recommended a round of antibiotics and a retest. 2 months later it was down to 3.2. He told me to come back in four months, but it was basically the same at 3.1. He recommended the biopsy (which was slightly uncomfortably in one lobe, but hurt like a mug in the other!). Results revealed 3/12 cores positive (all Gleason 6) with up to 30% of volume in the three cores. No evidence of PIN. I took the news like a champ, but slowly unraveled over the next few days. My uro has done hundreds of open prostatectomies and recommended surgery, although he took a couple of hours to explain all of my options to me and did not push anything. He said that I had some time and that I should carefully weigh my options. I have done my research and talked to other doctors, but believe surgery is my best course of action. I have been fortunate to have never had surgery in my life and I have some apprehension, but I also have a young family and I want the best shot that I can get. I am leaning on God and my always supportive wife and I am very grateful to have found this forum. Your psa seems in both the measurement and gyration seems almost normal for someone with such a history of chronic prostatitis. Really hard to tell what it would be without that condition. Still, now that you've had the biopsy you were faced with a decision. I'll tell you one thing, I would not proceed with surgery before having another expert read the same slides. Like Dr. Epstein at John Hopkins. You are moving as rapidly as possible having surgery only 2 months after the biopsy. I don't see the need to rush before exploring the entire situation. Your doctor has done hundreds. How many has he done in the last 6 months? I mean, \"hundreds\" could mean 250 spread over 20 years, or about 1 per month. I don't know, he could be doing several each week, keeping his skills sharp. You get only one shot at surgery. Take your time to make sure it goes well. Be very clear about the reality of the side effects of surgery. The definitions that the doctor uses and definitions that you use when discussing those issues. Often times people can be using the same words but not meaning the same thing as to the degree of the side effects.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Vick Anyway, it seems like mine is minimal, but I have an appointment with a Radiologist Oncologist this Friday, and an appointment with a surgeon on February 2nd. The more I research, the more confused I get. by the way, I am 61, will be 62 in February, and still work full time (45 - 50 hours a week - my company). Any suggestions? Yes, keep in mind that your results are minimal in terms of needing to do anything quickly. So allow yourself plenty of time to remove some of that confusion you've been getting from all your reading. Not saying anything will clear it up completely, but you will begin to view it from different perspective. Don't let either the radiologist or surgeon talk you into any quick decision. You may want get your biopsy samples read by another doctor, such as one at John Hopkins. For a sound confirmation. Not difficult and it doesn't take long. The results might be different. I know the word cancer scares some people, but right now, the larger danger to your health and longevity is from heart disease and stroke due to you being a Type 2 diabetic. So put the prostate cancer risk in perspective. People often think little of diabetes compared to cancer. As far as working, keep in mind all the men who have or have had prostate cancer who a are still working.... well past age 62. Secretary of State John Kerry, age 71, keeps up a schedule that would kill most men. Not forgetting that he had his prostate cancer treated the year before running for president in 2004. What could be more difficult than running for president? Hundreds of other well known men have gone through everything, hardly missing a beat in their work. Keep reading and keep all your options open. And don't overlook that Type 2. That is the real danger over the next 15 years.",

Look at this recent article where doctors that have a financial interest in radiation treatment may increase their usage of such equipment by a large percentage. \"The rate of IMRT use by self-referring urologists in private practice increased from 13.1 to 32.3%, an increase of 19.2 percentage points\" http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1201141 This type of bias could extend to other forms of treatment. Even to some types of surgery. Thus the need for second opinions and a full understanding of how a doctor is compensated. Doctors may even have this bias and be unaware of how it is influencing them. They would honestly deny it but it may still be present. This article about the same NEJM entry http://www.businessweek.com/news/201...ts-reap-profit",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Drbbt Hello everyone. I'd like to say that I am happy to be here, but I will say that I am happy that this forum is here. This is my first post, but I've been helped immensely by what I have found here already. I found out that I have PCa on July 22nd, just 4 days before my 48th birthday. I was not new to urology as I began having occasional bouts of prostatitis back in my early 30s. My PSA had fluctuated a bit over the past 5 years, but had never gone above 2.5 and had always settled back down. Couple of years ago it climbed to 2.6 and created some anxiety for me. We retested and it dropped to 1.7. For the next year, I forgot that I even had a prostate. Then it shot up to 4.2 (!!!) a year later. Based my history of chronic prostatitis and years of fluctuations, my doctor recommended a round of antibiotics and a retest. 2 months later it was down to 3.2. He told me to come back in four months, but it was basically the same at 3.1. He recommended the biopsy (which was slightly uncomfortably in one lobe, but hurt like a mug in the other!). Results revealed 3/12 cores positive (all Gleason 6) with up to 30% of volume in the three cores. No evidence of PIN. I took the news like a champ, but slowly unraveled over the next few days. My uro has done hundreds of open prostatectomies and recommended surgery, although he took a couple of hours to explain all of my options to me and did not push anything. He said that I had some time and that I should carefully weigh my options. I have done my research and talked to other doctors, but believe surgery is my best course of action. I have been fortunate to have never had surgery in my life and I have some apprehension, but I also have a young family and I want the best shot that I can get. I am leaning on God and my always supportive wife and I am very grateful to have found this forum. Your psa seems in both the measurement and gyration seems almost normal for someone with such a history of chronic prostatitis. Really hard to tell what it would be without that condition. Still, now that you've had the biopsy you were faced with a decision. I'll tell you one thing, I would not proceed with surgery before having another expert read the same slides. Like Dr. Epstein at John Hopkins. You are moving as rapidly as possible having surgery only 2 months after the biopsy. I don't see the need to rush before exploring the entire situation. Your doctor has done hundreds. How many has he done in the last 6 months? I mean, \"hundreds\" could mean 250 spread over 20 years, or about 1 per month. I don't know, he could be doing several each week, keeping his skills sharp. You get only one shot at surgery. Take your time to make sure it goes well. Be very clear about the reality of the side effects of surgery. The definitions that the doctor uses and definitions that you use when discussing those issues. Often times people can be using the same words but not meaning the same thing as to the degree of the side effects.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mitchden 7) The thought of having surgery and then having a negative biopsy is frightening. Do you know how frequent this happens? Hopefully, very very rarely. When my urologist did the DRE, he said that 1 side of the prostrate felt \"rubbery\". Has anyone had this reported? He was surprised that the cancerous core came from the other side of the prostate. Two weeks ago, I saw a radiation oncologist who also did a DRE. He told me he didn't feel anything. #8-- from another excellent site The DRE is used to detect possible signs of prostate illness: A DRE that finds a smooth, soft prostate but that causes intense pain is commonly a sign of prostate infection, also known as prostatitis. ---(I've also been told in those cases where there many be a asymptomatic prostate infection and no feeling of pain, described as feeling \"boggy\" upon exam...kind of spongy soft.) A DRE that finds a smooth, rubbery, and enlarged prostate is commonly a sign of prostate enlargement, also known as benign prostate hyperplasia. A DRE that finds hard nodules, generalized firmness, or an unusual shape to the prostate is commonly a sign of prostate cancer. #7--- I'm thinking that many patients are not fully informed about the final pathology when such negative cases come about. Unless the patient inquires further, everyone just walks away whistling while they look skyward. Perhaps thats just my imagination... or perhaps not.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman , 2.7, 2.9,2.7, then 3.1 six months ago. Went to uro doc today, got results - 4.3. Seems like a bigger jump than in the past. I am scheduled for biopsy next week. UGH. Am i wrong to think the odds of a negative biopsy are very much stacked against me here? Looks like until this recent psa of 4.3, that your psa has made only a tiny advance. From 2.7 to 3.1 over what appears to be a few years. Fair chance that if you repeated the psa in 3 months, you might easily go back down to a 3.2 or so. I'd retest your psa before undergoing another biopsy. Certainly don't see the need for a rush.

      "Content": "You did not give us your PSA history/results prior to the 4.2 test in March. Simply put, far too often, doctors get one jump up in psa and rush to the biopsy. Then far too often, they find harmless amounts of Gleason 6, such as in your case where there are two cores at 5%. That is a insignificant finding. In all probability your doctor should simply have waited after the single 4.2 test and allowed 3 to 6 months to pass, then testing again, he would have gotten the 3.1 result and you would have not needed the biopsy and the insignificant finding of two 5% cores would have never been found. ---And you'd be just fine, just like the millions of other men over age 60, walking around every day with insignificant, \"indolent\", cases of prostate cancer. But now, due to a premature and very possibly unnecessary biopsy, you are now declared to have cancer which might be unsettling to you and put you in line for endless testing and frequent biopsies. You should realize that about half the men you know between the ages of 65 and 95, have exactly the same \"cancer\" that you have. Except they don't know it and yet they will be just fine. PSA scores jump all over the place on a regular basis. You don't need to have a infection or any other cause. They just jump around naturally. I've had scores of 7.5 and 5.5... My most recent test was 2.8 If I got a biopsy every time it jumped up, I'd be full of holes. The only thing of note, was your brothers case, however we don't know the details of that. Do you know his psa history or biopsy result, age compared to yours. You should watch the following video to set your mind at ease. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 BTW, I also like my doctor, but he is often mistaken.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by vingal Sorry I haven't reported back until now. I had back surgery a couple of weeks ago, so I've been dealing with that. (Sucks to get old but I guess I don't have to tell you guys.) I'm 59 yo. My PSA was reported to me as .9 on a 4.0 scale, which confuses me because I haven't seen PSA reported like that anywhere else. At any rate, my doctor says it is low. The Gleason score is 7 (4+3); stage 1, bordering on 2. The core with cancer was not taken from the area of the nodule or the area identified on the MRI. My doctor is Badar Mian MD. He is trained in robotic surgery. Everything I can find on him seems to be very positive. When I see him on 2/27, I'll ask him questions like how many robotic surgeries has he performed, success rate re incontinence, ED, etc. He discussed all options, radiation, seeds, AS, but was definitely recommending surgery. I'd like to get a second opinion. Any suggestions on how to find an expert in the Albany, NY area? You need to get a second opinion on those biopsy cores. You can easily send them to a highly respected center like John Hopkins and have a top person take another look at them. I would ABSOLUTELY do that before acting on the basis on one interpretation by one doctor. BTW, you did not tell us the percent of involvement of that one positive core (4+3)... Meaning was it 10% or 50% or 90%....? In addition to asking the urologist how many specific prostate surgeries he has done using a robot, ask him how long he has been doing them and how many he does each week.. (not all robotic surgeries, but specifically the removal of the prostate) Of course you should also get second opinions because though he talked about other options, doctors who do robotic surgery have a strong bias for that form of treatment. If you ask him about incontinence.. and ED.... you MUST get from him, his precise definition of each of those terms. Far too many doctors declare that a semi-soft erection qualifies as usable and such designations can lead to misleading statistics. Take your time, it doesn't sound like you need to rush this.",

I'm hopeful that I'm not already dead. b) I am less concerned about side-effects than my kids (9, 13, and 15) growing up without a father. c) I don't have multiple PSA tests to see how fast the cancer is growing, but the fact that it is already palpable (big enough to feel), d) So eventual treatment seems highly likely. So what's the idea? You wait for it to get worse? The data I've seen suggests that as PSA levels rise, and/or clinical staging levels increase, the cure rates fall off rather quickly. Do I really want to wait for my PSA to hit 10? Or my staging to go to T2B or T2C? Some alternative thoughts to keep in mind. First from your reported status 5/31/16 PSA 6.1 7/15/16 DRE ridge left side T2A 7/21/16 Biopsy 3+3 on 2/12 cores involving 10% and 20% of tissue You've only ever had one psa test. Don't assume that is your true psa score. You could have a psa of 2.0 that just happened to be elevated that day or that week. Not at all unusual to have a bout of prostatitis that you might not even be aware of, that makes your psa jump up... even to 6+ The fact that they later felt something on the DRE doesn't make that idea null and void. You mention status as T2A... but wouldn't that mean the core(s) came from the ridge? Did the positive cores actually come from the \"ridge\"... Not at all impossible for a \"ridge\" or nodule to have nothing to do with the prostate cancer cores found to be positive. You mention that the biopsy was 3+3 on two cores involving 10% and 20%.. Have those two cores, or all the core samples been read by a second expert? Each of these three items, the psa, the DRE ridge, and the 2 positive cores, are not set in stone as being absolute. Anyone one or two of them, if not representative of the actual facts, could change your outlook and choice of going ahead with one treatment, or even any treatment. You seem to have read a lot, but you are still only 30 days post diagnosis. Nothing in your case suggests you need to be in a rush to get treated rapidly. Almost certainly some of your initial ideas will change over the next month or two. Regarding this one point from Walsh's book Potent 18 months: 86% Beware of definitions of \"potent\"... Doctors definition may not be at all like the patients definition. Or it may be that Walsh is the Jack Nicklaus of prostate surgery with all others scoring below him. \"I saw one other surgeon on line with 7000+ surgeries that has similarly positive claims of 83% regaining sexual function\" You should ask him for a written definition of \"regaining sexual function\"... I have a friend who regained sexual function... with injections. Mind you, he is still satisfied with his surgery, and married several years after the surgery to a much younger woman. Still he initially went through a couple years of frustration before going with injections. His surgeon was very positive prior to surgery. He was about 56 at the time of surgery. \"b) I am less concerned about side-effects than my kids (9, 13, and 15) growing up without a father\" A understandable concern, but I'd say the probability of them all being out of college before anything happens to you is extremely high... unless they decide to hang out in college for over 25 years.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Webheadfred My surgery will be scheduled next week. The Doc wanted to wait 6 weeks for the prostate to calm down after the biopsy. I did bleed for about 8 days. I should be having my surgery in the second or third week in July. Any thoughts? You had a biopsy on May 23rd and here we are 11 days later and you've already made your decision? What the heck is the rush? First of all, it is unclear whether you had 4 positive biopsies or 8 positive, since it appears that 2 were taken from each site. So, do you know if 4 or 8 were positive? Given that you had some 27 samples or about twice the normal number, then if you indeed only have 4 positive, that is equal to about 2 in the normal 12 core biopsy. All of yours are from 2% to 10%. If indeed there are only 4, which some might say, equals 2, then you should realize you may be a borderline case. I'm just giving you the other side of the coin. If I were you, I'd certainly give the decision process another month or so. I'm sure some others may disagree, but you should know, there is no rush to do surgery. Exactly what do you know about surgery and the side effects that most men have? Given the time frame within which you have made your decision, it would seem you've have little time to understand the whole picture. On the other hand, the surgery may be a fine choice. I'd certainly want to know all the details if I were in your shoes. Again, there is no rush at all",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ajm63 Hello all. This is my first post. I am 51 and have recently been diagnosed with PCa. Vital stats are as follows: 3/09 PSA 2.2 4/10 PSA 3.1 no PSA in 2011 to 2013 tests as testing age changed. 5/1/14 PSA 4.7 6//26/14 PSA 6/free PSA 7% (Different assay method than previous PSA tests) Biopsy 10/14 5 of 12 cores positive, both sides (<5% on 2, 5% on 2, 10 % on 1), 2 cores ASAP, G 3+3= 6 on all cores I have been doing quite a bit of research since the 7% free PSA test in June and have come down to surgery (open or robotic) or AS. From what I can tell I fit most of the AS criteria except for the fact that 5 cores were positive. Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that given that I am 51, the cancer will likely become a problem down the road, so I might as well deal with it now while the long term prognosis is best. Therefore, I am leaning heavily towards surgery in the near future. Am I missing something? . Though you have been researching this since your June free-psa test, you have had less than 3 week since the diagnosis. Now that it is a official reality in your mind, I'd not be creating any kind of rush on the decision...as indicated by \"surgery in the near future\". Minds and thinking can change from week to week. With 2 cores at <5%...2 cores at 5% and 1 core at 10%, there is certainly no need to rush on a decision. In fact whether you had possible surgery now or a year from now is unlikely to make much difference in the outcome. Just saying that learning more, then taking a few weeks off, then looking into it again a few times, often results in a different outlook. At the very least I would be exploring a wide rage of possible surgeons, even if it requires travel to the one you decide upon. Of course that may depend on your insurance. There are guys with big numbers and then there are artists with large numbers. They all sound overly confident. You didn't mention your location or what your insurance allows regarding choices. But the bottom line is that you need to avoid any rushing. Slow down, many would advise getting a second reading of the biopsy samples by someone like John Hopkins before proceeding. http://pathology.jhu.edu/department/...s/urologic.cfm You only get one shot at surgery. Best to be as sure as possible as to what you are dealing with.",

You may not realize it, but there is a very good chance that you already have prostate cancer. At your age, its about 50/50 regardless of the results you just got from your biopsy. I don't think I am exaggerating that one bit. In effect anyone with a 5.9 psa and about age 69 and above is already on Active Surveillance... Your's is just a bit less \"active\" then a official designation. The other way to ask the question is why would anyone want to treat prostate cancer if it wouldn't harm them before they die?

He did not seem to concerned about it since he thinks it is due to my enlarged prostate. He did a DRE and found nothing where as last JAN he said he felt a rough place. Said will do another PSA test 6 months. . Everything about your details seems completely normal. Your PSA and the jumps up and down are completely normal for many men. At your age and with a enlarged prostate, you shouldn't be concerned about the results. I would even suggest that doing another PSA in 6 months, instead of waiting 12 months, is a waste of medical dollars regardless of who is paying. Doing a free PSA when uncalled for is another unneeded medical expense. Had you not brought it up to the doctor, he never would have ordered it. Even if there is some tiny prostate cancer hidden somewhere, there is no need to find it sooner than 12 months from now. On the other hand, \"even though I piss like a race horse every hour and at night\" Do you really get up 6 to 7 times each night? How long has that been going on at such a hourly rate. How long ago were you only getting up once or twice a night?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Webheadfred My surgery will be scheduled next week. The Doc wanted to wait 6 weeks for the prostate to calm down after the biopsy. I did bleed for about 8 days. I should be having my surgery in the second or third week in July. Any thoughts? You had a biopsy on May 23rd and here we are 11 days later and you've already made your decision? What the heck is the rush? First of all, it is unclear whether you had 4 positive biopsies or 8 positive, since it appears that 2 were taken from each site. So, do you know if 4 or 8 were positive? Given that you had some 27 samples or about twice the normal number, then if you indeed only have 4 positive, that is equal to about 2 in the normal 12 core biopsy. All of yours are from 2% to 10%. If indeed there are only 4, which some might say, equals 2, then you should realize you may be a borderline case. I'm just giving you the other side of the coin. If I were you, I'd certainly give the decision process another month or so. I'm sure some others may disagree, but you should know, there is no rush to do surgery. Exactly what do you know about surgery and the side effects that most men have? Given the time frame within which you have made your decision, it would seem you've have little time to understand the whole picture. On the other hand, the surgery may be a fine choice. I'd certainly want to know all the details if I were in your shoes. Again, there is no rush at all",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I've also read that the Gleason score, after surgery, is found to be HIGHER than predicted by the biopsy somewhere between 20 and 28% of the time. I don't know the number, but there is a smaller percentage where the score turns out to be LOWER than predicted by the biopsy. I would always be nervous about going with AS -- until they are able to find a way to determine, without any doubt, the true nature of the cancer within the prostate. Only then will AS be a sure thing, risk-wise. Well then, you are going to have to treat millions and millions more men because prostate cancer is sitting there in a huge percentage of men walking down the street. Most of whom will never know it and few of whom will die from it. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23847245 Just one of many studies indicating that prostate cancer is wide spread in the general (unbiopsied) population. AS to the other issue about 20% - 28% of patients being upgraded after surgery and a smaller percentage being downgraded, that only makes sense if the great majority of patients treated begin as Gleason 6. Meaning that very seldom is a Gleason 6 downgraded. I can only recall a few times I've ever heard that. I suspect there are some instances when it is true, but the patient is not told, for obvious reasons. The trend of the field is to do more AS rather than less. That is clear. Up to the patient to weigh the risks and importantly access whether treatment down the road will be any less effective than treatment now. The problem is that most doctors are in a position where they only stand to get blamed if they don't treat. One has to realize that built in bias in their evaluation because they'll always hear about the case where waiting was wrong, but won't ever know if many other patients could have waited for 3 or 5 or 15 years and still be effectively treated or never treated. Up to fully informed patients to make the call and take the risk.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Alpez Thank you all for your replies. I do have a slightly enlarged prostate. My first psa test was done 9 years ago and was 5.8. I have had 4 biopsies since then with the last one being positive. My psa has been checked every six months for the past 9 yrs and has been as low as 2 and as high as my last test of 7.2. I have been on proscar which my doctor says keeps your Psa down. Well 9 years ago puts you at age 44. Appears you have a unusual case with psa tests and nothing until now found in biopsies. I was trying to get at the possibility that your psa fluctuates greatly for unknown reasons unrelated to prostate cancer and that the one core found was only incidental. In some men it does this. However you didn't include examples of your past couple years, three or four prior psa tests. As your doctor indicated, the Proscar can reduce the psa score from 30% to 70%, with 50% being the average reduction. That would put your true current psa at about 14. I have read of example here of high psa scores, but with little or no positive cores, and then they find the real source in the \"transition zone\" which seldom gets sampled in biopsies. Here is a example from someone who has posted here and elsewhere in the past. I present it only as a small possibility that it could be similar to your situation. http://www.yananow.org/display_story.php?id=557 All in all after 4 biopsies.. with the last one being 24 cores, finding a tiny amount of Gleason six would almost be expected in anyone. I'd guess that many doctors would assume that what was found (5%) is not what is responsible for your psa being 7.2 (times 2... 14.4) Have you gotten a second opinion from another urologist? I think I would want a fresh set of eyes to view my case before I'd proceed with any treatment.",

What was the date of the 7.2 psa test and what was the date and score of the prior psa test. Give us your history of psa scores and dates going back a few years. We don't know if this was your only psa test. We don't know if you were given several tests recently. It is very common for one single test to come in high, then the patient being given a biospy before further testing. Or given a follow up test only a few days or a few weeks later. This may not be the case with you, but we see it all the time. So give us a little history of your dates and results of your psa testing. Try to be precise with the dates. I would assume you were re-tested if the 7.2 was your only high result.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Alpez Thank you all for your replies. I do have a slightly enlarged prostate. My first psa test was done 9 years ago and was 5.8. I have had 4 biopsies since then with the last one being positive. My psa has been checked every six months for the past 9 yrs and has been as low as 2 and as high as my last test of 7.2. I have been on proscar which my doctor says keeps your Psa down. Well 9 years ago puts you at age 44. Appears you have a unusual case with psa tests and nothing until now found in biopsies. I was trying to get at the possibility that your psa fluctuates greatly for unknown reasons unrelated to prostate cancer and that the one core found was only incidental. In some men it does this. However you didn't include examples of your past couple years, three or four prior psa tests. As your doctor indicated, the Proscar can reduce the psa score from 30% to 70%, with 50% being the average reduction. That would put your true current psa at about 14. I have read of example here of high psa scores, but with little or no positive cores, and then they find the real source in the \"transition zone\" which seldom gets sampled in biopsies. Here is a example from someone who has posted here and elsewhere in the past. I present it only as a small possibility that it could be similar to your situation. http://www.yananow.org/display_story.php?id=557 All in all after 4 biopsies.. with the last one being 24 cores, finding a tiny amount of Gleason six would almost be expected in anyone. I'd guess that many doctors would assume that what was found (5%) is not what is responsible for your psa being 7.2 (times 2... 14.4) Have you gotten a second opinion from another urologist? I think I would want a fresh set of eyes to view my case before I'd proceed with any treatment.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by trinity3 Hi Everyone, I just got my lastest psa results. Just to remind you, I did have an abnormal DRE which has led to some further testing. My psa results are as follows, 2011 1.9; 2013 3.7; 8/2014 3.3; 9/2014 2.9. This last result also for first time measured free psa - which was 13%. The doctor still seems to think I am headed towards a biopsy just based on all the above considerations. He said the 13% free psa is abnormal as he would be looking for 15% or higher. So he wants to wait 3 months and have me do the psa again. I think he recognizes that I am hessitant about a biopsy but I am wondering based on what I have shared, is there any reason to hope that something will change to lead me away from a biopsy and am I being foolish to not demand one sooner? While the doc cannot be certain, there is nothing in the numbers that make him suspect we are dealing with anything aggresive. Steve What was it about the DRE that was abnormal. Did he give you any description of why it was \"abnormal\". Other wise, at age 58, I don't quite understand why your doctor places a limit of 2.5 on how high your psa should be. What is the size of your prostate? small, medium, large... I'd have to guess your doctor's take on this hinges on the \"abnormal\" DRE. Other wise I'd guess he wouldn't have given you the Free PSA test. There are mixed opinions about using the free-psa test when your psa is lower than the 4 to 10 range. You might read up on that. Your doctor seems reasonable. You are NOT being foolish to not demand a biopsy sooner. Test again in 3 months and see what you get.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by L Eugene I'm scheduled to have the Di Vinci surgery in the area where I live I'll read the threads today. The last few weeks have been a bit of a whirlwind . You have been overwhelmed with information. There seems to be no question but that you will have some form of treatment. Have you gotten a second opinion from the other two doctors, including one who deals mostly with radiation as a treatment? You might look into that. Now, if you decide to go with surgery, you need to know a great deal about who would be doing the surgery and how much experience they have. Flat out, you should ask how many Di Vinci surgeries they have done and for how many years they have been doing it. You want to know if they have done 50 or 250 or 500 or 1000+. That is critical information. Also you want to know how often they do the surgery. Twice a month or 4 times each week. Where they got their training in using the robotic machine. Don't be shy about asking those questions and watch for robotic only surgeries vs some who throw in all their prior non-robotic surgeries as well. I don't know if you are in a smaller town or large city. 9 of 12 biopsies positive both sides of prostate You did not mention the percentage involvement of each positive core. Like 10% or 35% or 65% or 90%. That might make a difference in choosing radiation vs surgery though I'm sure each of the 3 doctors had that information available. Your doctor can tell you that if he hasn't already.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by silver trooper Anyone else out there have or had a PSA that high with no detected cancer (yet)? Here is one man's story regarding diagnosis that you might find interesting I hope special links for specific stories are allowed. Can't remember the rules here regarding that. MODERATOR'S EDIT: Yes, this link was to another forum, so I had to delete it. HOWEVER, I did copy-paste the post down below for you. Chuck ************************************************** ************************************************** ********************** John Thompson and Jean live in California, USA. He was 63 when he was diagnosed in October, 2008. His initial PSA was 40.00 ng/ml, his Gleason Score was 7, and he was staged T1c. His choice of treatment was Brachytherapy (Seed Implant with EB and ADT). Here is his story. In 1999 I had a PSA of 4.4 and had a negative biopsy. Over the years my PSA has continued to rise and over the last 10 years I have had 12 biopsies from 4 different doctors and an endorectal MRI that were all negative. My PSA by this time had risen to 40. All doctors said that I probably didn't have cancer, but to continue to get a biopsy every year just to make sure. The 13th biopsy at UCI showed 2 cores out of 25 positive, Gleason 6 less than 5%. The urologist recommended surgery and was certain that the cancer was contained. I was making appointments for surgery and fortunately my wife told her oncologist about my diagnosis and he insisted I get a 2nd opinion from a prostate oncologist that he recommended before making any treatment decisions. It was the best move I ever made. The oncologist said the cancer that was found was statistically insignificant, and didn't warrant treatment, and most certainly wasn't the cause of my high PSA. He suspected something much more serious and ran a PSA3 and color Doppler ultrasound. Based on this he send me to an interventional radiologist who did a color Doppler ultra sound targeted biopsy. 3 out of 6 samples positive Gleason 7 were found. He had discovered a large tumour 16mm X 18mm in the transition zone that 13 previous biopsies and MRI had missed. I learned that most doctors don't biopsy the transition zone and when they do they go in at an angle that is not able to pick up most transition zone tumors. 25% of all prostate cancers are in the transition zone and are rarely biopsied. My oncologist still feels that this still doesn't account for all of my PSA. Bone and CT scans were clear but he wants to make sure there isn't small cancers in the lymph nodes. He is scheduling me for a Combidex MRI, a lymph node imaging protocol, in Holland that is supposed to be 90%+ effective in picking up small lymph node involvement. I'm trying to get scheduled for late Feb. There is only one doctor in the world that does this MRI and he's in Holland. The recommend treatment is Hormone therapy, followed by radiation, followed by more hormone therapy. The radiation will depend of if and where they find any lymph node involvement. I'll keep you updated on my progress. UPDATED April 2009 I went to Holland to have a Combidex MRI to confirm lymph node involvement. The MRI came up clear and I chose seeds and IMRT as a treatment choice. I would highly recommend the Combidex MRI to anyone suspected of lymph node involvement. I'm on Casodex and Proscar to reduce my 60mm prostate and PSA went to 15 after 7 days. I'm having a volume study done on April 7 and will start with seed implants in about 4-5 weeks. UPDATED June 2009 I had seeds implanted on May 19, 2009. It was a 3 hour procedure from the time I left my house to the time I got back; played golf 2 days later. The only side effects are frequent and slight burning urination getting better this last week. I start 5 weeks of IMRT at the end of June. I took Casodex and Proscar to reduce my prostate size, in 6 weeks PSA went from 30 to 0.6 and prostate from 60mm to 32 mm. UPDATED August 2009 Six weeks after I had seeds implanted on May 19th 2009, I had 25 treatments of IMRT which ended the 1st week in August. I had no side effects, energy level high, no fatigue. Only issue was urinary frequency for about 4 weeks after seeds. Now I just have to wait for my PSA tests to see if the treatment worked. My last PSA was undectable, but I had been taking Casodex. I'll stop Casodex in two weeks. John Thompson UPDATED July 2010 Just had my 1 year PSA test at 0.10; I have had no side effects from my treatments. JohnT UPDATED November 2010 I'm 19 months out now from treatment with Brachy and IMRT for a G4+3 and a PSA of 40. Last two PSA readings have been 0.1 and I have no side effects from the treatments. UPDATED November 2011 Last 3 PSAs were 0.10. I'm nearing the three year mark and still have no side effects from treatments. UPDATED December 2012 As of Dec 2012 psa checks every 6 months have shown psa steady at 0.1 since treatments. I have experienced no long term side effects at all and all symptoms of pretreatment BPH have disappeared. UPDATED January 2014 It's been nearly 5 years now and I'm happy to report all psas at 0.1 and no side effects at all. John's e-mail address is: [email protected]",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by sandy09 Hello to all. I'm 62 and regular viewer of the forum, albeit Prostate cancer free so far. I just visited my Uro doc yesterday to review my latest PSA readings. My PSA was 3.8, 6 months ago and now it's jumped to 4.7. He did a Free PSA test this time and it came back at 33%. He's told me this is good and I should be comforted by it. When he told me 4.7, however, I immediately thought that we should do a biopsy right away with the change since last time. He advised me not to jump into it so fast and that with my history of Prostatitis and BPH, the number could be related to that. He wants me to do a 4kscore test to see what the likelihood of me developing cancer is and then we'll sit and talk about what to do next, in about 3 weeks. I've been going to this doc for over 8 years and I do trust him and find his conservative approx makes sense in my sensible mind. He says he does lots of biopsies and assures me that if the 4kscore test comes back poorly, we'll arrange for me to have one. Otherwise he could suggest Active Surveillance. My gut tells me that if they find even the littlest bit of cancer I want it out! Am I overreacting to all this? Yes... you are indeed overreacting. Just as you were back in 2009... some 7 years ago. ( I went back and re-read your posts) Your path and increases closely mirror mine. (By the way, why don't you make a list of the last 8 years or more of psa tests and post them here. ) Anyway from the few items I see, you, like myself, got a jump up to 2.9 at age 54, from 1.4 the year earlier. Since then I suppose you've mostly had a gradual rise.. or perhaps not? Now you \"jump\" from 3.8 six months ago... to 4.7 now. First of all, why did you test after only 6 months? That itself is a important question. Let me tell you, my first \"jump\" up was to 2.6 at age 56 after 5 years of no testing, my only prior being 0.8 at age 51. Since then I have been all over the place.... \"Jumps\" of far more than you just got no longer concern me at all. Over the past 10 years since my 2.6, I have had lots of scores in the 3.5+ area to the 4.5+ area but I have also had results of 5.5 and 7.5 during that time. My most recent 4 annual tests were 3.8, 3.3, 2.8 and just last week, 3.4. Gosh... a \"jump\" from 2.8 to 3.4 in the last 12 months... OMG.. As you can see, PSA scores can and do \"jump\" all over the place. I will wait one year and re-test. If I get another 5+ or 7+, I will simply wait many months and retest. I will not lose any sleep over it. Simple and unnoticed \"asymptomatic\" prostititis inflammation can and does cause major \"jumps\" in PSA scores. 3.8 to 4.7 is nothing... Even a tiny bit of unnoticed prostititis can cause such a jump. I'd say you are even going overboard to take that special test. I'd bet if you weren't so hyped up, your doctor would be fine with you just waiting 6 months or a year to retest with a simple psa... no special testing. After all, your free psa is fantastic. DON'T be in a rush to biopsy...to find a inconsequential prostate cancer.... which then puts you in line for treatment of a cancer that most likely won't ever cause you problems. Your concern dial is cranked way up. Your statement \" if they find even the littlest bit of cancer I want it out\" is completely wrong... completely wrong. If they find the \"littlest bit of cancer\".... You DON'T want it out. Get used to the fact that before you turn 85, you will have prostate cancer, just as most 85 year old men have prostate cancer, most of it thankfully undiagnosed... You are very lucky to have sensible doctor. Don't push him into finding a prostate cancer that you don't want to find. Now, the usual video I tell men like yourself to watch.. A must see http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 Calm down, you're going to be just fine. If you are ever eventually diagnosed, you'll have tons of time to treat it successfully. Mean time, be happy to have your prostate. And stick with your current doctor. PS... in fairness, during my own series of psa results...some time after a result of around 4.0 to 4.5... I can't recall exactly... I did have a biopsy which turned up nothing. But if I got a similar psa score today, I'd not biopsy, but I might do as you did and get a free-psa... As I recall, my one psa was about 18% or 20%.. not nearly as good as yours at 33%.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by sandy09 Hello to all. I'm 62 and regular viewer of the forum, albeit Prostate cancer free so far. I just visited my Uro doc yesterday to review my latest PSA readings. My PSA was 3.8, 6 months ago and now it's jumped to 4.7. He did a Free PSA test this time and it came back at 33%. He's told me this is good and I should be comforted by it. When he told me 4.7, however, I immediately thought that we should do a biopsy right away with the change since last time. He advised me not to jump into it so fast and that with my history of Prostatitis and BPH, the number could be related to that. He wants me to do a 4kscore test to see what the likelihood of me developing cancer is and then we'll sit and talk about what to do next, in about 3 weeks. I've been going to this doc for over 8 years and I do trust him and find his conservative approx makes sense in my sensible mind. He says he does lots of biopsies and assures me that if the 4kscore test comes back poorly, we'll arrange for me to have one. Otherwise he could suggest Active Surveillance.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by dshinnick ... Any thoughts? Thanks- Dave Welcome... My thoughts.... Don't even entertain the idea of having any treatment any time soon. Retest your PSA in 3 to 6 months and again in 12 months. See how its going. In the interim you can slowly learn all about prostate cancer. Perhaps after 12 months, if your PSA is rising more than a bit, you could do another biopsy. Meanwhile you could do some healthy adjustments to your diet. http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf Watch this video.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by montrob I am a 59 year old, had DaVinci surgery for prostate cancer a year and a half ago. Always in pretty good shape before, no problems with erections. Had my surgery and came out achieved continence within 2 to 3 weeks. Now a year and a half later I have begun to have leakage problems to the point where I am wearing pads to absorb the leakage. Never have recovered the ability to have an erection despite using the blue pill for over a year. Now I feel like I was lied to. Would have traded 10 years of life for the ability to have an erection and control my leakage. Any suggestions I can't speak to the continence issues, but I would be optimistic that you can return to the state you were in only months after surgery in that regard. Don't limit yourself to one or even two doctors when getting opinions. That you had good control suggests there is a path back to that same position. Some doctors who are very busy, employ trained assistants that specialize in helping patients with incontinence. I'd guess that some of them are more skilled in that regard than the urologists. Certainly they have more time to address individual problems. Don't give up on finding a solution, before you resort to some surgical answer....which come with a whole other set of problems. Regarding the ED, a close friend of mine with some reluctance finally began using injections and has become quite satisfied with that approach after the initial getting familiar with the process. But what I really wanted to comment on was the following statement you made \"Now I feel I was lied to\".... I don't disagree with you in the following sense. As has been written in many articles, many doctors fail to inform their patients who are undergoing surgery about the true rate of ED and incontinence. They don't tell them what they consider to be ED and what they consider to be a usable erection. They raise false hopes by not being up front about their definitions of what constitutes a erection and continence. Even in this forum, the numbers of those who end up with ED and incontinence are under played. Most men... Most men, who undergo surgery will not return to having normal erections as they understand that definition. Too many doctors do not tell their patients about this expected outcome. Only if a man takes considerable time on his own to investigate the subject will he find out the true numbers and true definitions of ED and incontinence. Given the huge number of men who end up with outcomes they didn't expect, one has to be aware that such problems are not adequately discussed in many forums. Too much emphasis is placed on optimistic outcomes. Also, there seems a bias for not risking any danger to life expectancy. Meaning that if someone said you'd have a 10% chance of dying 10 years earlier, that many wouldn't even want to risk that. I think lots of men would accept a 10% chance of losing 10 years of life, if they decided to take some path other than surgery with all of its risks. The point is that patients need all the true facts and then they can decide on the risk they are willing to take. Generally speaking, doctors will advise the path that entails the lowest risk to patient life vs patient quality of life. Doctors seldom get blamed for too much treatment whereas they can be blamed for not doing adequate treatment. Thus, most doctors have a built in bias for treatment. That would be OK if they had adequately informed their patients of true outcomes. I know you are discouraged, but there is great reason to believe that you can overcome your incontinence problems with the right help. Also, as was the case of my friend, he has gotten to a place where he has a enjoyable sex life with the use of injections. BTW, he married his wife about two years AFTER his surgery and now 7 years later, they are doing fine.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mikla Otago: \"I think lots of men would accept a 10% chance of losing 10 years of life, if they decided to take some path other than surgery with all of its risks.\" Really?!! Based on what (in 50 words or less)? You give me 100 men with a low grade prostate cancer. Inform those men that they face a 10% chance that they may lose 10 years of their life if they don't do surgery. Then tell that same group that if they don't choose surgery, they have a 90% chance they won't shorten their life. I say, you get lots and lots of men who decide to take their chances when appraised of the real outcomes of surgery. Meaning fully informed about the data and definitions of incontinence and ED. Now, I'm not saying that every man who fails to choose surgery only faces a 10% chance of his life being shortened by 10 or more years, but there are many men who, if they had the choice to do over, would not go ahead with surgery. That is why there is a growing trend towards AS, as well as other forms of treatment. The data says take the risk, but it really depends on the individual and their own set of details. Gleason score, PSA, age, family, wife, and ability to live with uncertainty. All I'd want is to give each man full information. I'm guessing more than half of men go forward with surgery, without being fully informed of the true outcomes that can be expected. BTW, the average person on this forum is more informed than the average guy who is diagnosed. Going way back, there have been numerous articles about men who would make other choices if they had all the facts. Here is just one http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/0...ype=blogs&_r=0 We don't know montrob's particular details. It could be possible he was a Gleason 8 or 9 and would not change anything if he was fully informed. All we know is that right now, there is massive over treatment because we can't predict who will lose years of life if they don't do surgery. I believe that many of those who undergo surgery would choose to take their chances if fully informed about the true data. Others want no risk, even if its under 10%. As I've often said, if the level of risk aversion that is placed on prostate \"cancer\"..... were done for the average guy's reaction to heart disease, knowing the true risk data, then more than half of all prostate patients would overnight become vegans because the risk of losing 10 or more years of life from heart disease if far greater than 10%... In most prostate cancer patients, treated or untreated, their risk of dying from heart disease is far greater than dying of prostate cancer. Yet very few of them do total lifestyle changes, like becoming vegans or similar. I don't believe fully informed men would act like they do, for either prostate cancer or heart disease, if they were fully informed of the actual data and outcomes.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mikla Otago: \"I think lots of men would accept a 10% chance of losing 10 years of life, if they decided to take some path other than surgery with all of its risks.\" Really?!! Based on what (in 50 words or less)? You give me 100 men with a low grade prostate cancer. Inform those men that they face a 10% chance that they may lose 10 years of their life if they don't do surgery. Then tell that same group that if they don't choose surgery, they have a 90% chance they won't shorten their life. I say, you get lots and lots of men who decide to take their chances when appraised of the real outcomes of surgery. Meaning fully informed about the data and definitions of incontinence and ED. Now, I'm not saying that every man who fails to choose surgery only faces a 10% chance of his life being shortened by 10 or more years, but there are many men who, if they had the choice to do over, would not go ahead with surgery. That is why there is a growing trend towards AS, as well as other forms of treatment. The data says take the risk, but it really depends on the individual and their own set of details. Gleason score, PSA, age, family, wife, and ability to live with uncertainty. All I'd want is to give each man full information. I'm guessing more than half of men go forward with surgery, without being fully informed of the true outcomes that can be expected. BTW, the average person on this forum is more informed than the average guy who is diagnosed. Going way back, there have been numerous articles about men who would make other choices if they had all the facts. Here is just one http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/0...ype=blogs&_r=0 We don't know montrob's particular details. It could be possible he was a Gleason 8 or 9 and would not change anything if he was fully informed. All we know is that right now, there is massive over treatment because we can't predict who will lose years of life if they don't do surgery. I believe that many of those who undergo surgery would choose to take their chances if fully informed about the true data. Others want no risk, even if its under 10%. As I've often said, if the level of risk aversion that is placed on prostate \"cancer\"..... were done for the average guy's reaction to heart disease, knowing the true risk data, then more than half of all prostate patients would overnight become vegans because the risk of losing 10 or more years of life from heart disease if far greater than 10%... In most prostate cancer patients, treated or untreated, their risk of dying from heart disease is far greater than dying of prostate cancer. Yet very few of them do total lifestyle changes, like becoming vegans or similar. I don't believe fully informed men would act like they do, for either prostate cancer or heart disease, if they were fully informed of the actual data and outcomes.

You do know you need to sign up early so you'll be ready to go on that first day of that birthday month. Do I understand that you know which type of treatment you will choose? Often times if you are doing seeds, and your prostate is large, then they use hormones to shrink the size of the prostate prior to doing the seeds. Not sure if your prostate is large. One example of a study talking about this dual procedure. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20869105 I'm sure there are many many other studies you could look up. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/580995 Or you could just do nothing for 5 months. Probably wouldn't make a difference, but I suppose in a small percent, it could make some problem. In the prostate business, nothing is for sure. Where do you live? BTW, do you know the percentage of each of those 8 cores, that is involved? Like in each one being from 5% to perhaps 80%. I don't recall if you gave us that information. You and each doctor you see should know that information. If you acted sooner, you'd probably still be a month or so out anyway. In September at the earliest. Perhaps October. You need to know which type of treatment you will do and how fast you'd be doing it even if you had insurance. The time between that and waiting for Medicare may be small, if you did some preliminary planning prior to actually getting Medicare. Need to know which type of Medicare you'll have. Independent or through someone like Kaiser Senior Advantage,, or whatever they call it now? Where the HMO does all your care and you pay a supplemental fee each month. I take it you've explored all those aspects. Again, where do you live? Has anyone given you a \"total cost\" estimate of doing any of the treatments prior to getting insurance. How much for the total treatment?",

Very confusing Very important for you to know and give us your PSA history. What was the prior PSA test result before you got the 7.2 result? What was the date of the 7.2 psa test and what was the date and score of the prior psa test. Give us your history of psa scores and dates going back a few years. We don't know if this was your only psa test. We don't know if you were given several tests recently. It is very common for one single test to come in high, then the patient being given a biospy before further testing. Or given a follow up test only a few days or a few weeks later. This may not be the case with you, but we see it all the time. So give us a little history of your dates and results of your psa testing. Try to be precise with the dates. I would assume you were re-tested if the 7.2 was your only high result.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tattlebaum Initial test was on the 23rd, follow up on the 29th. I was given nothing between the dates additional to the statin and Omperazole I always take. Of note, one test is \"immunoassay Roche COBAS\" with a 4.0 as the high normal limit and the other unnamed with 4.5 as the high upper limit. What's with that? OK, according to some, if you are over 60, then 4.0 is the upper \"normal\" limit, and for some past age 60, they call 4.5 the \"normal\" limit. They are both talking about the same group of men. Don't pay too much attention to those differences. I could give you respectable doctors who suggest everyone over 2.5 should be given a biopsy. Much of the science about prostate cancer is all over the map. NOW, after a year or so, you getting your normal physical, etc, with a PSA....which came in at 6.... followed by ANOTHER... PSA test only SIX days later. Then referred to a urologist... who then gave you a biopsy. Well, in my book, that is sheer insanity. Waiting all of 6 days to do a followup test is madness.. Uninformed madness. If... IF a inflammation of any origin is boosting your PSA from 2 or 3 up to 6, there is little chance that inflammation will have subsided in only 6 days. You may not even be aware of the inflammation. Called asymptomatic prostatitis. Very common and can easily boost a PSA from 2.0 to 6.0 or 7.0. I have gotten a 7.5... only to have my current PSA at 3.3 Then after that silly confirmation test, you are put aboard the biopsy express train. Yes, they did come up with a Gleason 6, something that you may have been better off never having been discovered. Now you are officially a \"cancer patient\" whereas if they had waited 3 to 6 months to retest your PSA, there is a good chance it would have been back in the 2.0 to 2.9 range. Which of course would not have entitled you to a biopsy. Then you may well have lived the rest of your life officially without prostate cancer. You see, the majority of men have prostate cancer before they die. Except most of them are undiagnosed and are never affected by the prostate cancer. But now you are on board the train. Called upon to make decisions and to worry. First off all... do nothing for now. Wait 6 months and retest your PSA. At the very least, if you can't stand it, wait 3 months and retest. Nothing bad is going to happen by waiting 6 months. Good chance your PSA will be back under 3.0. Now, listen to this interview. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 Listen to all of it, especially focus on minute 8:00 onward. Speaks about those who get spikes in PSA, only to return to normal range if they only wait. But too often, by then, they were forced to under go a biopsy and now they are officially a \"cancer\" patient....faced with the mess of treatment options, for a \"cancer\" that in most men, would never have caused them a problem. We can't know for sure what you'll find in 6 months, but for now, you have been prematurely put through a unnecessary biopsy procedure. That they found some \"official\" prostate cancer, in Gleason 6.... small amounts, only makes you a normal man of age 62. Be assured of this' you will die with prostate cancer, as will most men. Only a good portion of men are never aware of it and are unaffected by their cancer. Too bad you had a biopsy after two psa's only 6 days apart. Now wait.. Retest in 6 months... and don't spend much time worrying. Very good chance you are just fine. A fair chance.. you'll never need treatment. A very small chance you'll ever die of prostate cancer. Remember now, my PSA was 7.5 and now it is 3.3",

Personally I am looking most seriously at the DaVinci nerve-sparing prostectomy right now, if I can convince my insurance company to do it... Please share any thoughts and recommendations, or insight...? ! You might include your past PSA history. Why were you given a biopsy? Include your past psa history. Was there something felt on a DRE? Unless there are other missing factors, if I was in your shoes, I'd do absolutely nothing. From what you have given us, you are the prime example of someone who could do no treatment. Instead, just do AS... sit back and see what happens in a year or two or five. Most men in your situation could do nothing and end up living to age 85 or 90 without ever treating their prostate cancer. They'd be just like the other 80 year old men, over half of whom die with prostate cancer, but from other causes. Seriously, move very very very very slowly on this. Take 6 months or a year before making a decision about treating this low grade prostate cancer. Listen to the following discussion/interview between two highly respected experts in the field http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 11 minutes long. I don't see how you can listen to that and still feel the need to take action right away. Apparently you are new to all of this, only having your results for a few days. I can assure you, at this point you know almost nothing about the subject. If you did, you be amazingly more hesitant to do anything quickly. Certainly in ZERO rush to come to any decisions. You could sit back, read up and study for the next year, and be in no more danger than you are now. If after a year, you decided to make a treatment choice, it would almost certainly be just as effective a year from now, or even two years from now, as it would be today. You also need to learn far more about the side effects. Far too many men underestimate the side effect from surgery. Only a minority of men return to full sexual function (like it was before), after having surgery of any type. You need to be very precise on the definition of what constitutes a usable erection. Many doctors will give out glowing numbers of the percentage of their patients who have full function. It can be very different than the patient's definition. That difference lead to much disappointment after surgery as expectations are not met. The same hold true for the definition of continence. What you consider continence may not be the same as the doctors definition. If you take a good deal of time, you will begin to understand the actual reality of what to expect after surgery or other treatments.",

If people pick out the PSA tests they choose to count, they can often come up with all manner of rises.... Why not pick the 2011 test which was 1.59 and couple it with your latest 2015, 1.94...? Because then instead of a 0.6 rise in ONLY 12 months, you get a 0.35 rise in FOUR years!... No one is going to rush you back into a unnecessarily rapid retesting for a average rise of less than 0.1 per year. Again, it appears your doctor is the only one looking at the greater picture. Why do you insist on second guessing him and rushing off to see a second urologist for entirely normal numbers? I can assure you that if you continue \"looking for\" something, you'll soon find some doctor more than willing to take a 12 core biospsy, \"just to be sure\" You seem to be hunting for something that is not advisable to find.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Steven72 Now, I've been referred to a urologist for a DRE, and I have a PSA re-test. The Dr. hesitated, but prescribed a two week course of Cipro to address the diarrhea and potential prostatitis. I'm on day 5 of the Cipro, and the diarrhea is improving. Do not rush to have your next PSA test any time soon after finishing your Cipro. If...and its a big if....If your prostatitis was caused by a bacterial infection, then even after treatment with antibiotics, it can take some time for the inflammation to calm down, such that you get a true PSA score. I'd wait many weeks, a month or more. Also please be aware that the majority of prostatitis is not caused by a bacterial infection and thus the antibiotic can't cure it. Sometimes the only cure is more \"time\"... Originally Posted by Steven72 Anyway, it all seems very weird to me... and of course, the a bad scenario here is that the previous Doctors should have investigated the discharge further, and because they didn't, it may well be Prostrate Cancer that has spread into my bowel - causing the diarrhea. Of course, the best case scenario is that the two are unrelated, the Cipro kills the bugs causing the diarrhea and the prostate infection. . Extremely....very extremely unlikely...that a prostate cancer has spread to your bowel and is causing diarrhea.. I wouldn't even be thinking about that. Far more likely you just had a bad meal at Chipolte...",

      "Content": "tgow, Originally Posted by tgow At first I was really strict on myself and didn't eat any fat. Just couldn't grasp the concept of high fat. Ketosis induced itself at that time. I use a lot of olive oil and like the natural fats in the foods. Probably eat 20 eggs per week, beef, pork, salmon and tuna, veggies. Not as strict now with bread as I've discovered low carb tortillas, but still limit those. Can enjoy a ham and cheese sandwich using lettuce leaves as bread slices. . That recent study had more to it than just lowering some refined carbs and replacing them with some vegetable oils. In that same study they gave out numbers, death rates per thousand years of study (or however they define such things) Anyway, regarding your link to the Diet Doctor and his favored way of eating. The study looked at death rates for the highest quintile vs the lowest quintile For prostate cancer specifically, the highest users of vegetable oils was 4.7 vs 8.7 for the lowest users For Prostate cancer specifically, the highest users of animal fats was 8.3 vs 5.7 for the lowest users For All Cause motality specifically, the highest users of animal fats was 32.0 vs 17.2 for the lowest users. http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/arti...icleid=1696179 http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-eou060613.php http://www.bioportfolio.com/news/art...w-Studies.html You might keep those numbers in mind when you visit the Diet Doctor's site again. The picture is not completely clear, however if there is one thing most people in the field of prostate cancer agree upon, its that animal fats are the least beneficial type of food for that condition. Who knows, that concensus might change, but for now I'd be thinking the Diet Doctor's ideas are not entirely compatible with the science around prostate cancer. You might read the results of this recent study diffently but I thought you would like to see more of the details.",

You might have a pilot, co-pilot, instructor pilot, and flight examiner - all doing their assigned duties and logging time on the same flight. You might have a daVinci trainee getting 'stick time' on the rough cutting, and the team chief/master surgeon/instructor doing the more critical parts. Both get to chalk up one mission. B'lieve I saw somewhere there are three 'hands' and two operator consoles on the machine. Could be mistaken, tho. They exist http://www.intuitivesurgical.com/pro...alconsole.html However in local settings I think they are very rare. I think most surgeons just go to training classes for a few days or so.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mitchden With regard to AS, does anyone know how many people eventually have treatments and over what period of time? If there's a high probability that I will need treatment in 5 years, I would be concerned that my body may not be as strong to handle treatment than it is today. Additionally because I struggle with depression and anxiety, I'm not sure I can handle AS. For much of my adult life, I've been on medication for depression and anxiety. This emotional roller coaster is very stressful. When someone tells me that I won't die of prostate cancer, it's based on statistics. As Ben Franlin said, \"In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.\" Well, clearly the exact picture of your biopsy samples.....is unclear. Great example of how one has to take the \"thought to be\" precision with a grain of salt. You have some concern about how a \"older\" you might be able to handle treatment later on. It would seem you are mostly referring to surgical treatment. I don't think you should have the same concerns if you choose focused external beam radiation, or seeds (brachytherapy), which are equally good treatments for someone like yourself. I am the same age as you. I also have some heart issues though I have not yet had a suggested stent placed. I'm holding out and have completely changed my lifestyle. Though you are concerned about what to do regarding treating or watching your prostate cancer, having closely followed both prostate cancer and coronary artery disease (CAD) for years, I can tell you that I'd be far less concerned about this early prostate cancer than I would be about your existing CAD. Meaning I'd be taking every step available to curtail advancement of CAD before I'd be focusing on the prostate cancer. But the good thing about that emphasis is that the very lifestyle steps that are beneficial for CAD are the same ones for slowing prostate cancer progression. I do realize that not everyone is up for doing all those changes, but I thought I'd bring it up just in case you might be motivated for such. A study of individuals on AS ...some doing the lifestyle changes and some doing their normal routine, ended up with many more on their old ways, needing subsequent treatment compared to those making the significant lifestyle changes. BTW, are you on a statin? Which one, how much... There is a fair amount of data on how that impacts any potentially aggressive prostate cancer. So lots of ideas out there which could impact your choices of whether to proceed with treatment or not. One thing for sure..... and it cannot be emphasized enough..... with your borderline call, there is zero need for you to come to a quick decision. Take your time... slowly evaluate all the choices and paths. You've already witnessed the imprecision of the testing and science. This prostate cancer condition is going very slowly.. and has been inside of you for many many years. It didn't just pop up in the last 12 months. Unlikely to change much over the next 6 months.",

      "Content": "Thanks for filling in the facts. Well, either way, it appears you have 7 positive cores out of 24 total. That alone would seem to exclude AS (active surveillance) However your actual psa might still be in question. You will be getting follow up psa test results for a blood draw on Dec. 13. That will be interesting, however a note of caution. You only had your \"24 core\" biopsy 17 days prior to that blood draw. Not only are you possibly waiting for any prior inflammation from prostatitis to calm down, but now you've thrown in another potential inflammatory issue, the 24 core biopsy. --\"Recent prostate biopsy can cause a significant increase in PSA values.\" --\"After biopsy, it may take a month or more before the PSA returns to baseline.\" source http://www.lexmed.com/docs/understanding_psa_test.pdf So lets see the result of the psa , but keep in mind those two potential influencing factors. 1. the fairly recent inflammation, and 2. the very recent biopsy. Might be you'll want to do another psa test in about mid January. It is still possible your true \"prostate cancer related\" psa is actually under 10. Can make some difference in your choice of treatment and level of concern, or even your feeling of urgency to treat. That you got all Gleason 6 is good. Might turn out lucky that you got that urinary infection that seems to have brought about the further testing of your psa.",

We can understand the right lobe, 1 core at 2%, but out of 12? on the right side? or 12 total? Then you indicate 4 positive on the left side at 8%. I can't imagine that all 4 are each at 8%.

Could you give us a timeline on that psa testing. Date of the first psa test, then how soon and how long you were treated with antibiotics. Then importantly the following questions-- #1. how long after finishing the antibiotics were you tested for the second time? #2. How long between the first psa test and the second psa test? Were you ever actually tested for a urine infection and was a actual bacteria found in that test? Or was it just assumed that your symptoms indicated a urinary bacterial infection so you were given antibiotics either for that or for both that and a potential bacterial caused prostatitis? You should understand that most prostatitis is caused by non-bacterial inflammation. Thus the antibiotic will not kill a bacteria that does not exist. And your inflammation that can be the cause of the spiked PSA will persist, often for a good deal of time afterwards. Months.... So you could have a low risk Gleason 6 prostate cancer along with a seemingly higher risk PSA score that is mostly not caused by your prostate cancer, but rather by your prostatitis. It can take considerable time for prostatitis to calm down and for the PSA to reveal its true level. IF your PSA were only 4 or 7 in stead of 17, then you might feel a bit less anxious. Though you still would have prostate cancer. But it may be fairly low risk that could influence your treatment choices or at least the feeling of being rushed to act quickly. Those doctors indicating you should wait, may be counting on your true PSA reading to be much lower than in the last tests. \" Biopsy showed prostatitis and chronic inflammation\"...

Only a small subset of men come to sites like this where all the issues are discussed. Think about it, there are 238,000 new cases in the USA alone. If you go to the 2 to 4 major discussion sites you might find at most perhaps 1000 individual posters, many of whom are long timers. Then if you assume that 20 times that number read the site, that is still less than 20,000. Thus less than 1 in 10 diagnosed patients read these forums. Probably far less because they draw world wide readers. Most probably read articles on the internet, but those tend to not discuss details about how effective doctors are who have less than 200 or 300 surgeries.",

At that time there is normally a few questions about how it does or doesn't relate to prostate cancer growth. Added fuel to the fire or completely safe. So the debate or discussion goes. Anyway here is another article about Low-T Therapy and how fast is has grown in the past decade, six fold. I've always been skeptical about Low-T Therapy in all but the most clear cut cases. I remember when they put most women on HRT (hormone replacement therapy) 20 to 30 years later the science began to emerge and now most women no longer take HRT, deeming it too risky. Men and women age. Their hormones change. That is natural. I'd be very hesitant to begin adding or adjusting testosterone levels unless I had classic and well defined Low-T.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by webster Hi all, Recently OH had his PSA checked which came back as 7.8, up from 2.2 4 years ago. He is only 57. This set in motion some tests, MRI and a TRUS biopsy that is scheduled in the next 90 to 120 days. Public hospital system wait list here. We did the MRI a couple of days ago. . Obviously this is a very stressful time and the wait for answers is very difficult to cope with for all of us. So how do I best support him through this process? It's so hard to see your partner going through this As is often the case, doing a biopsy after ONE jump in PSA is crazy, unless there are other factors. You report nothing that would indicate prostate cancer other than the ONE jump in PSA. I have had large jumps twice. The last one was to 7.5. I did not do a biopsy after that 7.5. Instead we waited either 3 or 6 months and then my last PSA was 3.3. Lucky for you the TRUS biopsy is scheduled 3 or 4 months from now. Two weeks before that appointment you need to get another PSA done. If it is around 3.0 or less you should cancel that biopsy. The notion that every jump in PSA should lead to a biopsy is madness. Retesting the PSA a 3 or more months later is the right way to approach this. You and your partner have allowed your lack of knowledge of this to cause you grief. When I was 57 my psa was about 2.7... Seven years later it is 3.3 But as stated, it has jumped twice, with one jump being 7.5. I no longer worry about jumps. We calmly wait and retest. Look at this thread http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...-My-PSA-Is-5.5 Then look at this thread http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...iopsy-Is-Today Then look at the same guy starting this new thread http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...s-of-My-Biopsy All that worry over nothing. Should have waited to retest his PSA in the first place, rather than jumping to a biopsy.",

      "Content": "Thanks for filling in the facts. Well, either way, it appears you have 7 positive cores out of 24 total. That alone would seem to exclude AS (active surveillance) However your actual psa might still be in question. You will be getting follow up psa test results for a blood draw on Dec. 13. That will be interesting, however a note of caution. You only had your \"24 core\" biopsy 17 days prior to that blood draw. Not only are you possibly waiting for any prior inflammation from prostatitis to calm down, but now you've thrown in another potential inflammatory issue, the 24 core biopsy. --\"Recent prostate biopsy can cause a significant increase in PSA values.\" --\"After biopsy, it may take a month or more before the PSA returns to baseline.\" source http://www.lexmed.com/docs/understanding_psa_test.pdf So lets see the result of the psa , but keep in mind those two potential influencing factors. 1. the fairly recent inflammation, and 2. the very recent biopsy. Might be you'll want to do another psa test in about mid January. It is still possible your true \"prostate cancer related\" psa is actually under 10. Can make some difference in your choice of treatment and level of concern, or even your feeling of urgency to treat. That you got all Gleason 6 is good. Might turn out lucky that you got that urinary infection that seems to have brought about the further testing of your psa.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by njs I believe the best (but definitely not perfect) way to compare surgeons apples-to-apples is to look at their positive surgical margin (PSM) rates stratified by pathological stage. For the handful of best surgeons in the world this is 2% or less for true organ-confined (pT2) disease and around 25-30% for non-organ-confined (pT3+) disease. As far as I have know, Samadi has not published his PSM rates. The best PSM rates I have seen are from Tewari (Cornell, but soon to moving be Mt Sinai) and Ahlering (UC Irvine) who have both published studies showing specific refinements in technique that have significantly reduced their PSMs. Although I don't believe he has published them, Dr. Allaf who is chief of robotic surgery at Johns Hopkins, told me his pT2 PSM rates were also sub 2% when I consulted with him. From his website \"The SMART Technique It should be emphasized that the SMART technique is an advanced technique that should not be performed early in a novice robotic surgeon\u2019s learning curve. Since 2003, Dr Samadi has performed over 2,000 RALPs, approximately half by this technique. In the 12 months since the final modifications were made to this technique in early 2008, he has performed more than 2,224 RALPs. We are able to achieve continence rates of 97% and potency rates of 81% at 1 year (in 193 and 169 patients, respectively) while maintaining a 4% rate of positive surgical margins. \" Now, one must be very careful when seeing data on both continence and especially potency rates. The definition of each is important. What constitutes a full erection widely varies. I seriously doubt he has 81% of his patients reporting that sex is just like before surgery. You need to ask for a very detailed and precise definition of these terms before accepting them as valid. Still he may be among the best surgeons around. Hard to tell.",

Because then instead of a 0.6 rise in ONLY 12 months, you get a 0.35 rise in FOUR years!... No one is going to rush you back into a unnecessarily rapid retesting for a average rise of less than 0.1 per year. Again, it appears your doctor is the only one looking at the greater picture. Why do you insist on second guessing him and rushing off to see a second urologist for entirely normal numbers? I can assure you that if you continue \"looking for\" something, you'll soon find some doctor more than willing to take a 12 core biospsy, \"just to be sure\" You seem to be hunting for something that is not advisable to find.

Seemed awfully jumpy giving you a 14 core biopsy after that Oct. 2012 2.2 psa. Your psa didn't jump from 2.2 to 2.7 in two weeks. Why the second psa test at all? Did he detect something on the DRE? Also, who was it who did the DRE then gave you a blood draw? Then 6 months later, another psa and a free psa. Perhaps we're missing something here that you didn't include. Seems your treatment is very aggressive unless he felt something on the DRE. BTW, how did your father's PCa evolve. I'm your age and my father also had PCa but lived 25 years after being diagnose at age 63, so I have a somewhat more relaxed view of the subject. He died of other causes. However your father may have had a more difficult case. What was his age at diagnosis? You may be on track for something, but first I'd probably question that second 2.7 psa. The free psa issue wouldn't even qualify if your psa was less than 2.5. At 2.8 its more borderline as to giving you a good picture. Above all, you had 14 negative cores. I'm sure if he felt something, he would have told you so and directed the samples at that location. Perhaps you have more info. (Note,) I just looked at some of your older posts and they answer some of my questions. I won't rewrite the above as it indicates my wonderment at the rather fast trip you took to a biopsy. I think you need to take a more relaxed attitude about your entire situation. Heck, I'm 63 and have had psa readings of over 7 and over 5 on two tests. I'm now at around a steady 3.8. Had one negative biopsy about two or three years ago and don't really worry about it. I still come here because I just like the subject and am interested, but I don't think much about it in terms of worry. Put it this way, I'm almost certain there is some Gleason 6 some where in my prostate if I was only given enough biopsies over time. But that doesn't bother me knowing that is probably the case. I just want to delay it for 5 or 10 or 20 years and if needed treat it later, or never. Gave up worrying about it a few years ago.",

I guess these are questions the urologist will answer, but I'm just concerned. Thanks again. Yes... test vary and even when the lab is accurate, the psa can jump all over the place. I have had tests that jump from 3.5 to 7.5 and then back to 3.8 six months later. I've had several jumps like that. I do not run for a biopsy every time that happens or I'd be getting stuck with needles every year. My last PSA was 3.3. I've had tests of 7.5 and over 5.5. You simply don't understand the many causes of jumps in PSA. You don't even need to see a urologist now. Just wait a minimum of 3 months (6 months better)... and retest. Far better than getting 12 giant needles punched into your rear end.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JD1969 Scheduled a biopsy, which was done last Wednesday (7/3/13), still waiting on the results form that. I have pretty much accepted that with THAT high of a PSA, along with firmness of the prostate, that I have very high chance of PC. Well, you should be getting the results any day now. That will clear up most of your ideas. We can't guess what \"firmness\" means as only your doctor felt that. However, just based on the PSA test, the second confirmation, after only 3 weeks, would have hardly given enough time for any infection or non-bacterial \"itis\" to have calmed down. There are lots of reasons you could have had a temporarily high PSA. So don't start thinking surgery just yet. You may have gotten yourself into all this worry over nothing more than inflammation or \"itis\" caused by something minor. In fact the odds favor just that. See what you get, then think about getting a new doctor IF it is even necessary at all. BTW, who did the biopsy?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JD1969 I just figured that with a PSA that high, it would most likely not be caused by an \"itis\". I hope that is all it is, . Actually a \"itis\" is the thing that makes a PSA go \"that high\" and much more, far more likely than prostate cancer in a person your age. Here is a Q&A from a famous urologist who is well known in prostate cancer fields -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OUTSIDE THINGS THAT AFFECT PSA LEVELS: Q.--In a normal, healthy man, would sexual intercourse the morning of the PSA test is performed raise the levels and possibly by how much if at all. Could a prostate exam prior to the PSA test elevate levels and by how much? Could an infection in a healthy man elevate PSA to 21? A.--The answer to all three questions is yes. Usually, ejaculation or a prostate exam has only a slight effect on the PSA level that lasts for 24 to48 hours only. The PSA might increase a point or two. With infection, very high PSA levels can occur (even up to 21 or higher) and in some cases it takes a long time for the PSA levels to return to baseline. In about 25% of cases, antibiotic therapy is effective; however, some men have to wait for their body\u2019s defense mechanisms to clear the infection. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BTW, not all infections or inflammation would give you a burning sensation. They can be there and be asymptomatic in terms of sensation, but might still cause some difficulty with urinating brought about by a possibly enlarged prostate. Of course I am no doctor and you'll get your results soon. We hope those are good. Odds are still on your side.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tomseeley My reason for asking is: right now, we're planning a 2-week RV trip March 5-18. If the PSA is done Feb 17, is it practical to plan on fitting in the biopsy between then and going on the RV vacation March 5? Or is more likely that the biopsy would be put off till after mid-March? I'd get the PSA test done about March 3rd or 4th... allowing even more time for any inflammation to have calmed down since December and your round of antibiotics. Then I'd not get the PSA results until you return from your nice RV trip. If the results are still high, you can then do a quick biopsy. There is little to be lost in delaying a few weeks and depending on the results of either the psa or the biopsy, you could really ruin your trip. Right now, I'd assume the best and not get any results before you return. Imagine how your RV trip will be if you get a high psa or especially a positive core in a biopsy. After all, regardless of the results of those tests, you won't be taking any immediate action. Why possible ruin a good trip. Get the PSA test just before you leave... even the day before... or the day you return. Don't feel the need to call in quick and get the PSA result before you leave. Don't have it emailed to you or call to get it. Yes, sometimes a \"head in the sand\" approach is the best, especially with a potential very slow growing prostate cancer.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Flkjr Howdy. You seem to have a history of yo-yoing PSA. Your 7.3 in 2006 was followed by a 5.0 in the same year and a 4.5 the following. Why not wait 6 months (or even 3) and see if it indeed comes down again. If not then get that biopsy. Good luck and stay positive. I'd second this opinion. Even if it does drop back to around 5.0, then depending on how \"enormous\" your prostate is, you may or may not go ahead with a biopsy. At least you will have confirmed the PSA at 5.0 or perhaps 8.0, which might make a difference in how you approach treatment if you decide to do anything. Of course, the fact that you had a negative biopsy back in 2006 doesn't mean there wasn't some cancer back then. So if you are comfortable, give it 6 months or 3 months, just in case some \"itis\" or inflammation is driving the PSA up to 8.0. My psa jumps around more than yours. Have had 7.5 and 5.4 followed by going back under 4.0 and now down under 3.5 I no longer jump to biopsies after a jump up... but if I had the 7.3, followed by your 8.0... and that 8.0 was confirmed, then I'd do another biopsy just to see what is going on. BTW, at age 67, getting up once a night seems more normal than abnormal.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lukasnyc Guys what do you think I should do about that other doctor that my father went to about 4.5 psa. He didn't recommend any test. Should I seek legal advice ? I am angry that he didn't tell him to repeat psa sooner nor he did any other test to figure out why psa is above normal. . You need to slow down. Prostate cancer is very slow in almost all cases. You are way off base in your assessment of the original doctor. You have not included your father's entire PSA history, but for the doctor to not act on a initial 4.5 psa test is rather normal. In fact under some criteria 4.5 is still considered normal at age 64. http://www.medicinenet.com/prostate_...igen/page3.htm Not doing a biopsy after ONE 4.5 reading is good medicine. Doing a biopsy at the drop of the hat, the first time someone gets a 4.5 would be unwise. There is ZERO reason to contact legal help. His doctor acted well within the standard of care. In fact he probably did a good job by NOT rushing to a biopsy based on one 4.5 psa test. As others have indicated, we have no idea what his real data is. the \"7\" could be 7 positive cores, or it could be 3+4= 7 Either way there is no rush for immediate appointments or decisions. Calm down, this is all going to take a very long time. There is every reason to believe your father has overwhelming odds to live well into his 80's, and die of something unrelated to prostate cancer. My father, diagnosed \"late\" at age 63, lived until age 88, dying of other causes.",

My point being that for much of the uneducated public you need to introduce the \"cancer\" as not typically being something like they think of most cancers. I don't know your job, but I can't imagine if you were in a car crash that they would fire you for taking some time off. I think the bigger issue is for them to not think of you dying down the road, or being unable to do your job in the future.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lukasnyc Guys what do you think I should do about that other doctor that my father went to about 4.5 psa. He didn't recommend any test. Should I seek legal advice ? I am angry that he didn't tell him to repeat psa sooner nor he did any other test to figure out why psa is above normal. . You need to slow down. Prostate cancer is very slow in almost all cases. You are way off base in your assessment of the original doctor. You have not included your father's entire PSA history, but for the doctor to not act on a initial 4.5 psa test is rather normal. In fact under some criteria 4.5 is still considered normal at age 64. http://www.medicinenet.com/prostate_...igen/page3.htm Not doing a biopsy after ONE 4.5 reading is good medicine. Doing a biopsy at the drop of the hat, the first time someone gets a 4.5 would be unwise. There is ZERO reason to contact legal help. His doctor acted well within the standard of care. In fact he probably did a good job by NOT rushing to a biopsy based on one 4.5 psa test. As others have indicated, we have no idea what his real data is. the \"7\" could be 7 positive cores, or it could be 3+4= 7 Either way there is no rush for immediate appointments or decisions. Calm down, this is all going to take a very long time. There is every reason to believe your father has overwhelming odds to live well into his 80's, and die of something unrelated to prostate cancer. My father, diagnosed \"late\" at age 63, lived until age 88, dying of other causes.",

I just wanted to interject something about this issue of being able to get back onto TRT after one chooses to get treatment for prostate cancer. Your statement follows from Mikla's statement in his original post as follows \"The minor complication is that I have low testosterone and have been getting 100mg testosterone/wk IM and it had significantly improved my energy level, mood and libido.

If you take 100 men who go on AS during which they give up TRT and compare them to 100 men who take some form of treatment for prostate cancer, I am betting that those who go on AS have a far greater chance of having a superior sexual experience relative to those who undergo treatment.

So, I'd just not want Mikla to think that undergoing treatment, then getting back on TRT, is the best idea for improving libido or improving sexual performance. Quite the opposite is more likely given all the data and stats. Of course individual cases are unique, but the overall numbers are clear in regard to this issue.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mikla My wife is awesome and very understanding, but having low energy and libido is taxing on her and me. So I am a bit stuck... I am currently thinking that this would be the best plan: 1. Stop smoking 2. Lose some weight and improve diet 3. Exercise more (I certainly have the time) 4. AS for six months and re-access Age 55, DOB 11/1957, 6'2\", 240# 08/29/2013 Biopsy: 2/12 positive (RLM,RLA), <5%/core, Gleason 3+3 ! I wouldn't even consider being treated now if I had your numbers. I'd wait and keep tracking your PSA, which according to you was probably about 3.8 in earlier tests and now in the mid 4 range. If it keeps advancing then do another biopsy in a year. I don't think I'd bother fishing around with a additional biopsy. I mean, the sampling is such a small portion of one's prostate that to have any certainty you'd have to do about 100 cores. Simply getting another 10 or 12 is fractional confirmation at best. You could randomly grab 55 year old guys walking down the street and come up with a portion who have Gleason 6 in one or two cores at 5% or greater. Take a look at this excellent measured discussion of the subject by two well known urologists. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 Delay is not always bad, even if you later seek treatment. Now, in the mean time, regarding your potential danger from PCa as well as your libido and your overall health. (btw, you didn't include your cholesterol panel, blood pressure and the other stuff such as your blood sugar readings which can be very important in pre-diabetes, Impaired Glucose Tolerance or Impaired Fasting Glucose etc). In your current state, you are probably 10 times more likely to die of heart disease than from prostate cancer, even if you never treat your prostate cancer. Lucky for you the changes in lifestyle needed are similar for all your problems, prostate cancer, heart disease, and even libido improvement without the injections. When is the last time you were fit? Smoking, obesity (over 30 BMI), and lack of exercise all affect your libido. Seriously, smoking is the most dangerous thing in your current health profile. You do know how bad it is for heart disease, right? You do know that all those blood vessels in your heart are not dissimilar to the blood vessels that bring blood to your penis, right? Unless you have fantastic genes you probably have a fair degree of typical heart disease in process. Greatly compounded by your long time smoking. All the damage your diet, lack of exercise, and smoking do to your heart are being done everywhere else your blood flows. The more radical dietary changes many prostate cancer subjects make are identical to those which studies have shown are best for your heart. BTW, they also bring about considerable weight loss in most subjects. A Trifecta of benefits. Dr. Dean Ornish has done published studies on this diet and how it affects PSA progression in those with diagnosed prostate cancer. How it slows the advance of your psa. UCSF (University of California, San Francisco) has a good overall nutrition guideline (64 pages) here... http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf Good for your prostate cancer advancement, excellent for your probable heart disease, and a near guarantee on weight reduction. A fairly good chance that following such a diet, along with a real exercise program, will do wonders for your libido even if you never take any more TRT injections.. You are 55, this may be a blessing in disguise for your overall health regardless of whether you treat or don't treat your prostate cancer. I'll tell you this, if you and your wife are concerned as you indicate about your libido, then you may face problems soon anyway, with all your other factors. Age, obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, etc. That combo leads to a good percentage of men losing it by age 55 or 60. OK, more than you asked for, but from your original post, you seem to have already come to many of the same conclusions. Time for action now, regarding all those lifestyle changes that will absolutely be beneficial to your future health. Your wife will be supportive and no doubt she could use some of the same lifestyle changes. If you like, I could suggest a few books to look into.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I've also read that the Gleason score, after surgery, is found to be HIGHER than predicted by the biopsy somewhere between 20 and 28% of the time. I don't know the number, but there is a smaller percentage where the score turns out to be LOWER than predicted by the biopsy. I would always be nervous about going with AS -- until they are able to find a way to determine, without any doubt, the true nature of the cancer within the prostate. Only then will AS be a sure thing, risk-wise. Well then, you are going to have to treat millions and millions more men because prostate cancer is sitting there in a huge percentage of men walking down the street. Most of whom will never know it and few of whom will die from it. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23847245 Just one of many studies indicating that prostate cancer is wide spread in the general (unbiopsied) population. AS to the other issue about 20% - 28% of patients being upgraded after surgery and a smaller percentage being downgraded, that only makes sense if the great majority of patients treated begin as Gleason 6. Meaning that very seldom is a Gleason 6 downgraded. I can only recall a few times I've ever heard that. I suspect there are some instances when it is true, but the patient is not told, for obvious reasons. The trend of the field is to do more AS rather than less. That is clear. Up to the patient to weigh the risks and importantly access whether treatment down the road will be any less effective than treatment now. The problem is that most doctors are in a position where they only stand to get blamed if they don't treat. One has to realize that built in bias in their evaluation because they'll always hear about the case where waiting was wrong, but won't ever know if many other patients could have waited for 3 or 5 or 15 years and still be effectively treated or never treated. Up to fully informed patients to make the call and take the risk.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wjw My thought, which I also will be discussing with my urologist/surgeon, is that waiting for treatment after positive diagnosis of cancer gives you a higher probability of increasing Gleason score thus a higher probability of cancer returning. This seems to contradict the validity of AS altogether. . I think you are talking about two different things. (1) A Gleason 6 evolving into a Gleason 7 (2) a Gleason 7 being found after the prior biopsies had only located a Gleason 6. I don't think those Gleason 6 cancers turned into Gleason 7. The prostate is like a loaf of bread with some olives hidden in it. Some may be Gleason 6 and some may also be Gleason 7. Into that loaf of bread you insert some straws hitting some cancer and often missing many others. In your case it would seem they missed the Gleason 7 olives rather than the Gleason 6 olives turning into Gleason 7 olives. The study you read indicated a 45% return after 18.6 years. I am unclear if those aged 65 or older were treated at that age or are being followed up at that age. You don't indicate the median age of that group or their age when initially treated. All those details are important. Until you know those figures the picture is unclear. Of course we could entirely eliminate AS and treat everyone with Gleason 6 and even that would not change the status of those who were actually Gleason 7. In your case there doesn't seem to be any indication you would have been treated better even if you acted sooner. I suppose there are lots of studies with varying results as to the eventual outcome of large groups of Gleason 7.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Flkjr Howdy. You seem to have a history of yo-yoing PSA. Your 7.3 in 2006 was followed by a 5.0 in the same year and a 4.5 the following. Why not wait 6 months (or even 3) and see if it indeed comes down again. If not then get that biopsy. Good luck and stay positive. I'd second this opinion. Even if it does drop back to around 5.0, then depending on how \"enormous\" your prostate is, you may or may not go ahead with a biopsy. At least you will have confirmed the PSA at 5.0 or perhaps 8.0, which might make a difference in how you approach treatment if you decide to do anything. Of course, the fact that you had a negative biopsy back in 2006 doesn't mean there wasn't some cancer back then. So if you are comfortable, give it 6 months or 3 months, just in case some \"itis\" or inflammation is driving the PSA up to 8.0. My psa jumps around more than yours. Have had 7.5 and 5.4 followed by going back under 4.0 and now down under 3.5 I no longer jump to biopsies after a jump up... but if I had the 7.3, followed by your 8.0... and that 8.0 was confirmed, then I'd do another biopsy just to see what is going on. BTW, at age 67, getting up once a night seems more normal than abnormal.",

However, even after you complete your antibiotics, it could take some considerable time for your prostate to get back to normal and give you a accurate PSA test. Even after the infection is gone you could still have residual inflammation. Don't be in a rush to get that PSA test. Although they may give you one sooner just to make sure they are following the right path. You didn't mention what your PSA result was in December. You only said it was normal.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by weballoon Otago, thanks for your reply. I am 62. Diagnosed 12/5/2014. So I am just getting into the research. My time frame for action is the next 3-6 months. (I don\u2019t want any chance of it spreading so I am being aggressive). I have not gotten a second opinion on the Biopsy results. 12/5: Biopsy results (1 core positive; 5% cancer; Gleason 3 + 3) Well, you are 3 days into being diagnosed. My first bit of advice is to make NO decisions about treatment for at least 6 months. The chance of it spreading during that time is negligible. Allow yourself some months, not weeks, to get a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd take on all the information you will be digesting. Of those diagnosed, you are in the very very safest end of the spectrum. Quite frankly, in your position, I'd do nothing for at least a year except to get a second opinion on your 12 cores, and to follow your psa every three or four months. You might look at the following video interview between two well known prostate cancer specialists... done at the 2013 American Urological Association (AUA) Annual Scientific Meeting. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 I simply can't imagine either of those two doctors suggesting you do any treatment in the coming 12 months. You can allow yourself time... and it does take time... to gain a balanced view of the whole subject of prostate cancer. In short, slow way down. Don't even begin to think about finding the right surgeon any time soon.",

Gary, nice that your wife can accompany you to the appointment. Let her be the one taking most of the notes as you may be overwhelmed with the information during the appointment. It appears you will be having some type of treatment. Many urologists do one or the other treatment and tend to have somewhat of a bias for the one they specialize in. But of course you can see others who specialize in the other options. And even if you decide on the option your urologist specializes in, there is no requirement that you have him do it. If during your visit he indicates the treatment he may do... then at that point, even though you are far from a decision, you might ask him how many of those procedures he has done... and how many he does each week or month. Where he got his training. (some doctors get their training only from short courses over a few days, while some have done year long fellowships involving the new robotic machine) You don't have to grill him, but those questions are ones you would need to know the answer to eventually.

I just mention it because it might crop up in your mind AFTER you've left the appointment.... then you have to call the office...and its just easier while you are there.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Webheadfred My surgery will be scheduled next week. The Doc wanted to wait 6 weeks for the prostate to calm down after the biopsy. I did bleed for about 8 days. I should be having my surgery in the second or third week in July. Any thoughts? You had a biopsy on May 23rd and here we are 11 days later and you've already made your decision? What the heck is the rush? First of all, it is unclear whether you had 4 positive biopsies or 8 positive, since it appears that 2 were taken from each site. So, do you know if 4 or 8 were positive? Given that you had some 27 samples or about twice the normal number, then if you indeed only have 4 positive, that is equal to about 2 in the normal 12 core biopsy. All of yours are from 2% to 10%. If indeed there are only 4, which some might say, equals 2, then you should realize you may be a borderline case. I'm just giving you the other side of the coin. If I were you, I'd certainly give the decision process another month or so. I'm sure some others may disagree, but you should know, there is no rush to do surgery. Exactly what do you know about surgery and the side effects that most men have? Given the time frame within which you have made your decision, it would seem you've have little time to understand the whole picture. On the other hand, the surgery may be a fine choice. I'd certainly want to know all the details if I were in your shoes. Again, there is no rush at all",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Deech But I'm wondering what is accomplished if he lowers his PSA at this point? I suspect it's a measure of denial at work but I surely do not know. (I hesitate to ask him directly because 1) he IS a medical professional and 2) I don't want to sound like I'm challenging his professional opinion. ) He, (the urologist/surgeon) is also opining that a second opinion for his stats is not warranted. If anyone has thoughts on that, I would appreciate any comments. PSA May/2012 2.97 PSA Aug 2013 3.91 PSA May 2014 3.1 PSA May 6, 2015 8.5 PSA May 20, 2015 12.9 Prostate Needle Core Biopsy Highlights June 2015: Right mid: low grade adenocarcinoma, Gleason 3+3 = 6, present in 1 of 2 core biopsies, occupying 1% of 1 core left apex: low grade adenocarcinoma, Gleason 3+3 = 6, present in 1 of several cores, occupying 10% of 1 core Stage T1C Weight of prostate 55g . Seems to me like the only one using sound thinking in this case is your husband. Everyone else, including many of those making the other comments, are saddling up the horse, ready to gallop off and attack the invasion.... before they are even certain there is a enemy to fight. It is very possible that the cancer found in your husband is simply a normal age related finding of indolent prostate cancer, that is present in about half the men his age. The ONLY thing suggesting other wise is ONE single snapshot of his PSA. Why do I say ONE single snapshot? Because taking a second psa test, only 2 weeks after the first, allows no time for a inflammation, bacterial or non-bacterial, to calm down. Indeed it could get worse, and produce exactly the results you have seen in his two tests. Even if it is bacterial and the course of antibiotics can help, it may still take some time to get a accurate psa reading that is not affected by a bout of prostatitis. Take the antibiotics... but realize that some prostatitis is not only non-bacterial, unaffected by the antibiotic, but may also be asymptomatic, yet produce a large jump in psa results. By all means get a second opinion from another well respected urologist who is known for not jumping the gun and who is also known for encouraging active surveillance when appropriate. But for the sudden and possibly brief jump in PSA, your husband could be a prime candidate for AS. I'm troubled by the surgeons leap to quick surgery and his dismissive attitude about getting a second opinion. Very troubled by such a view. There is at least a 50/50 chance he needs no treatment at all. Your husband seems to be the only one not in a panic mode. Aside from a course of antibiotics, he may just need some time for this inflammation to pass. Prostatitis bouts can be very stubborn even with antibiotics. Read up about that before jumping to the knife. Thank goodness the doctor is on vacation, and that your husband is not being railroaded into rapid surgery. You and your husband need to stand back, take a deep breath and proceed with caution. His doctor might be right, but there is no solid indication that he is right. Don't be at all surprised if his psa over the next 3 or 6 months is right back at 2.9 to 3.9. If so, he is more than appropriate for AS. I hope he gets to read these posts. We can't link some sites here, but here is one section from a well known and respected site ============================================= Apart from these variances, PSA levels can be elevated by a number of causes, from infection to physical activities. For this reason it is very important to try to establish the cause of any elevated PSA level reported. If the PSA is below 20 ng/ml this should be done before having a biopsy. The most common causes of an elevated PSA are: prostatitis (an infection of the prostate); a bladder infection; or BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia). This last condition affects most men over 50 years of age and is not deadly. Any infection should be treated before a second PSA test is carried out. Acute prostatitis can cause the PSA levels to rise five to seven times the normal level for up to six weeks or even longer. Both prostatitis and bladder infections are notoriously difficult to treat. There are various natural and pharmaceutical products that may reduce the size of a gland and these may reduce the effect of BPH on the PSA level =================================================",

My urologists indicated that I would be a candidate for Active Surveillance (AS) but also outlined the various radiation and surgery options. After doing some general research I am not comfortable with the AS or radiation options and will likely pursue surgery. How recent is \"recently diagnosed\"... ? Meaning how much time have you had to evaluate your situation? What is your age and what is your complete PSA history... especially the dates and results of your past few years of PSA tests? Was your PSA tested again after your 5.8 ? How long after that 5.8 was taken? Were your 12 biopsy cores read for a second opinion by some place like John Hopkins? What is your time frame for action?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Deech But I'm wondering what is accomplished if he lowers his PSA at this point? I suspect it's a measure of denial at work but I surely do not know. (I hesitate to ask him directly because 1) he IS a medical professional and 2) I don't want to sound like I'm challenging his professional opinion. ) He, (the urologist/surgeon) is also opining that a second opinion for his stats is not warranted. If anyone has thoughts on that, I would appreciate any comments. PSA May/2012 2.97 PSA Aug 2013 3.91 PSA May 2014 3.1 PSA May 6, 2015 8.5 PSA May 20, 2015 12.9 Prostate Needle Core Biopsy Highlights June 2015: Right mid: low grade adenocarcinoma, Gleason 3+3 = 6, present in 1 of 2 core biopsies, occupying 1% of 1 core left apex: low grade adenocarcinoma, Gleason 3+3 = 6, present in 1 of several cores, occupying 10% of 1 core Stage T1C Weight of prostate 55g . Seems to me like the only one using sound thinking in this case is your husband. Everyone else, including many of those making the other comments, are saddling up the horse, ready to gallop off and attack the invasion.... before they are even certain there is a enemy to fight. It is very possible that the cancer found in your husband is simply a normal age related finding of indolent prostate cancer, that is present in about half the men his age. The ONLY thing suggesting other wise is ONE single snapshot of his PSA. Why do I say ONE single snapshot? Because taking a second psa test, only 2 weeks after the first, allows no time for a inflammation, bacterial or non-bacterial, to calm down. Indeed it could get worse, and produce exactly the results you have seen in his two tests. Even if it is bacterial and the course of antibiotics can help, it may still take some time to get a accurate psa reading that is not affected by a bout of prostatitis. Take the antibiotics... but realize that some prostatitis is not only non-bacterial, unaffected by the antibiotic, but may also be asymptomatic, yet produce a large jump in psa results. By all means get a second opinion from another well respected urologist who is known for not jumping the gun and who is also known for encouraging active surveillance when appropriate. But for the sudden and possibly brief jump in PSA, your husband could be a prime candidate for AS. I'm troubled by the surgeons leap to quick surgery and his dismissive attitude about getting a second opinion. Very troubled by such a view. There is at least a 50/50 chance he needs no treatment at all. Your husband seems to be the only one not in a panic mode. Aside from a course of antibiotics, he may just need some time for this inflammation to pass. Prostatitis bouts can be very stubborn even with antibiotics. Read up about that before jumping to the knife. Thank goodness the doctor is on vacation, and that your husband is not being railroaded into rapid surgery. You and your husband need to stand back, take a deep breath and proceed with caution. His doctor might be right, but there is no solid indication that he is right. Don't be at all surprised if his psa over the next 3 or 6 months is right back at 2.9 to 3.9. If so, he is more than appropriate for AS. I hope he gets to read these posts. We can't link some sites here, but here is one section from a well known and respected site ============================================= Apart from these variances, PSA levels can be elevated by a number of causes, from infection to physical activities. For this reason it is very important to try to establish the cause of any elevated PSA level reported. If the PSA is below 20 ng/ml this should be done before having a biopsy. The most common causes of an elevated PSA are: prostatitis (an infection of the prostate); a bladder infection; or BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia). This last condition affects most men over 50 years of age and is not deadly. Any infection should be treated before a second PSA test is carried out. Acute prostatitis can cause the PSA levels to rise five to seven times the normal level for up to six weeks or even longer. Both prostatitis and bladder infections are notoriously difficult to treat. There are various natural and pharmaceutical products that may reduce the size of a gland and these may reduce the effect of BPH on the PSA level =================================================",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by montrob I am a 59 year old, had DaVinci surgery for prostate cancer a year and a half ago. Always in pretty good shape before, no problems with erections. Had my surgery and came out achieved continence within 2 to 3 weeks. Now a year and a half later I have begun to have leakage problems to the point where I am wearing pads to absorb the leakage. Never have recovered the ability to have an erection despite using the blue pill for over a year. Now I feel like I was lied to. Would have traded 10 years of life for the ability to have an erection and control my leakage. Any suggestions I can't speak to the continence issues, but I would be optimistic that you can return to the state you were in only months after surgery in that regard. Don't limit yourself to one or even two doctors when getting opinions. That you had good control suggests there is a path back to that same position. Some doctors who are very busy, employ trained assistants that specialize in helping patients with incontinence. I'd guess that some of them are more skilled in that regard than the urologists. Certainly they have more time to address individual problems. Don't give up on finding a solution, before you resort to some surgical answer....which come with a whole other set of problems. Regarding the ED, a close friend of mine with some reluctance finally began using injections and has become quite satisfied with that approach after the initial getting familiar with the process. But what I really wanted to comment on was the following statement you made \"Now I feel I was lied to\".... I don't disagree with you in the following sense. As has been written in many articles, many doctors fail to inform their patients who are undergoing surgery about the true rate of ED and incontinence. They don't tell them what they consider to be ED and what they consider to be a usable erection. They raise false hopes by not being up front about their definitions of what constitutes a erection and continence. Even in this forum, the numbers of those who end up with ED and incontinence are under played. Most men... Most men, who undergo surgery will not return to having normal erections as they understand that definition. Too many doctors do not tell their patients about this expected outcome. Only if a man takes considerable time on his own to investigate the subject will he find out the true numbers and true definitions of ED and incontinence. Given the huge number of men who end up with outcomes they didn't expect, one has to be aware that such problems are not adequately discussed in many forums. Too much emphasis is placed on optimistic outcomes. Also, there seems a bias for not risking any danger to life expectancy. Meaning that if someone said you'd have a 10% chance of dying 10 years earlier, that many wouldn't even want to risk that. I think lots of men would accept a 10% chance of losing 10 years of life, if they decided to take some path other than surgery with all of its risks. The point is that patients need all the true facts and then they can decide on the risk they are willing to take. Generally speaking, doctors will advise the path that entails the lowest risk to patient life vs patient quality of life. Doctors seldom get blamed for too much treatment whereas they can be blamed for not doing adequate treatment. Thus, most doctors have a built in bias for treatment. That would be OK if they had adequately informed their patients of true outcomes. I know you are discouraged, but there is great reason to believe that you can overcome your incontinence problems with the right help. Also, as was the case of my friend, he has gotten to a place where he has a enjoyable sex life with the use of injections. BTW, he married his wife about two years AFTER his surgery and now 7 years later, they are doing fine.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tattlebaum Initial test was on the 23rd, follow up on the 29th. I was given nothing between the dates additional to the statin and Omperazole I always take. Of note, one test is \"immunoassay Roche COBAS\" with a 4.0 as the high normal limit and the other unnamed with 4.5 as the high upper limit. What's with that? OK, according to some, if you are over 60, then 4.0 is the upper \"normal\" limit, and for some past age 60, they call 4.5 the \"normal\" limit. They are both talking about the same group of men. Don't pay too much attention to those differences. I could give you respectable doctors who suggest everyone over 2.5 should be given a biopsy. Much of the science about prostate cancer is all over the map. NOW, after a year or so, you getting your normal physical, etc, with a PSA....which came in at 6.... followed by ANOTHER... PSA test only SIX days later. Then referred to a urologist... who then gave you a biopsy. Well, in my book, that is sheer insanity. Waiting all of 6 days to do a followup test is madness.. Uninformed madness. If... IF a inflammation of any origin is boosting your PSA from 2 or 3 up to 6, there is little chance that inflammation will have subsided in only 6 days. You may not even be aware of the inflammation. Called asymptomatic prostatitis. Very common and can easily boost a PSA from 2.0 to 6.0 or 7.0. I have gotten a 7.5... only to have my current PSA at 3.3 Then after that silly confirmation test, you are put aboard the biopsy express train. Yes, they did come up with a Gleason 6, something that you may have been better off never having been discovered. Now you are officially a \"cancer patient\" whereas if they had waited 3 to 6 months to retest your PSA, there is a good chance it would have been back in the 2.0 to 2.9 range. Which of course would not have entitled you to a biopsy. Then you may well have lived the rest of your life officially without prostate cancer. You see, the majority of men have prostate cancer before they die. Except most of them are undiagnosed and are never affected by the prostate cancer. But now you are on board the train. Called upon to make decisions and to worry. First off all... do nothing for now. Wait 6 months and retest your PSA. At the very least, if you can't stand it, wait 3 months and retest. Nothing bad is going to happen by waiting 6 months. Good chance your PSA will be back under 3.0. Now, listen to this interview. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 Listen to all of it, especially focus on minute 8:00 onward. Speaks about those who get spikes in PSA, only to return to normal range if they only wait. But too often, by then, they were forced to under go a biopsy and now they are officially a \"cancer\" patient....faced with the mess of treatment options, for a \"cancer\" that in most men, would never have caused them a problem. We can't know for sure what you'll find in 6 months, but for now, you have been prematurely put through a unnecessary biopsy procedure. That they found some \"official\" prostate cancer, in Gleason 6.... small amounts, only makes you a normal man of age 62. Be assured of this' you will die with prostate cancer, as will most men. Only a good portion of men are never aware of it and are unaffected by their cancer. Too bad you had a biopsy after two psa's only 6 days apart. Now wait.. Retest in 6 months... and don't spend much time worrying. Very good chance you are just fine. A fair chance.. you'll never need treatment. A very small chance you'll ever die of prostate cancer. Remember now, my PSA was 7.5 and now it is 3.3",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Omar1968 This is my first post to this forum. I am 46 years old, and I was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma (acinar, not otherwise specified) Gleason Pattern: Primary 3, Secondary 3, Total 6 PSA 4.82 This was my first and only PSA Number of cores positive: 2 Total number of cores: 22 Proportion of prostatic tissue involved by tumor: 5% I have seen three surgeons, Any information you can share with me will be greatly appreciated as I attempt to make a decision. #1. Slow down. You say you have been \"recently diagnosed\"... What was the date of your diagnosis and what was the date of your psa test. Did no one suggest that you do a follow up psa test instead of just proceeding to the biopsy? Either way, I'd want a follow up psa test to confirm what your true psa result is. Frankly they should have done a second psa test before doing the biopsy... unless they also felt something on your DRE exam. Now, I'd still like a 2nd psa test.. because your true psa could be 1 or 2 instead of 4.82. #2, Anyway they did a biopsy. Did they give you any reason why they did 22 cores? That seems excessive for a 1st biopsy. Makes it all the more likely to find something... even a insignificant prostate cancer. Which brings up the 2 cores at only 5%... Actually had they done the more normal 12, it is probable they would have had 1 positive core at 5%... A Gleason 6 in one core at 5% would seem to be a very good case for AS... Especially if your true psa turned out to be only 1 or 2. #3... Certainly before I'd be making any decisions, I'd be sending in my slides to another institution for second analysis. We had recent person here, given a Gleason 8 score (3+5) who turned out to be a Gleason 6 (3+3)... (he sent his to John Hopkins and they couldn't imagine how he got a 5 reading) #4. . Slow down ( I know I said that twice) You only get one shot at this. If they take out your prostate, there is no going back. Again, why didn't they retest your psa, and what reason did they give for doing 22 cores? I'm trying to take the conservative angle on this because often men get into the \"get it out quick\" mode. You could do as each surgeon suggested... do watchful waiting... perhaps for 6 months or one year, while you gain a better feel for the whole subject matter and then make a decision after that time period. It appears that if all the surgeons think that AS is reasonable option, that they don't sense a need to rush. I don't either.",

Been reading as much as I can about it and there's so much conflicting information... . You should include the date you had the recent test and retest. Specifically, how long was the time between those two tests? That is important. Also what if anything were you given between the two tests? In other words... if the time between the two recent tests was insufficient for a inflammation to have calmed down, then your psa of 6 and 7 might be abnormal for you and your true psa may still only be 2 or 3. So let us know the time between the two tests. Often doctors recheck only a month or less after getting one higher psa.... then if its still high they whisk you off to the uro who finds a low risk Gleason 6 that would have been better if it were not discovered... Or perhaps your doctor waited 3 to 6 months for the next psa test. Let us know.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I've also read that the Gleason score, after surgery, is found to be HIGHER than predicted by the biopsy somewhere between 20 and 28% of the time. I don't know the number, but there is a smaller percentage where the score turns out to be LOWER than predicted by the biopsy. I would always be nervous about going with AS -- until they are able to find a way to determine, without any doubt, the true nature of the cancer within the prostate. Only then will AS be a sure thing, risk-wise. Well then, you are going to have to treat millions and millions more men because prostate cancer is sitting there in a huge percentage of men walking down the street. Most of whom will never know it and few of whom will die from it. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23847245 Just one of many studies indicating that prostate cancer is wide spread in the general (unbiopsied) population. AS to the other issue about 20% - 28% of patients being upgraded after surgery and a smaller percentage being downgraded, that only makes sense if the great majority of patients treated begin as Gleason 6. Meaning that very seldom is a Gleason 6 downgraded. I can only recall a few times I've ever heard that. I suspect there are some instances when it is true, but the patient is not told, for obvious reasons. The trend of the field is to do more AS rather than less. That is clear. Up to the patient to weigh the risks and importantly access whether treatment down the road will be any less effective than treatment now. The problem is that most doctors are in a position where they only stand to get blamed if they don't treat. One has to realize that built in bias in their evaluation because they'll always hear about the case where waiting was wrong, but won't ever know if many other patients could have waited for 3 or 5 or 15 years and still be effectively treated or never treated. Up to fully informed patients to make the call and take the risk.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman So after having a cardiac catheterization 2 months ago with 2 stents inserted, to clear blockage sq, I'm having another one this morning. Had a very slight tightness in my throat when I run, after about a minute, that goes away when I slow to a walk. Honestly I'm not sure if it's real, or in my head, because I am so hyper aware of every little sensation since the stents were inserted in June. In fact, it's so slight, that I told the Dr if I wasn't looking for it, I wouldn't even notice it. Each case is different. I exercise 6 days a week for the last 3.5 years. That is over 1,000 episodes of exercise. I have felt angina on about 998 of those days. Again your situation may have other details, but simply feeling a bit of angina in your arms, neck, jaw, or chest is not unusual for someone with some blockages. It normally falls under the category of \"stable angina\". If it happens when you are not exercising, well that is another matter. My angina comes on about 3 to 4 minutes into my exercise routine, however if I were to start off faster or jog/run up hill, I could bring it on within 1 to 2 minutes. I am used to it by now and while I'd rather it were gone, the small temporary discomfort between minutes 3 and 16...(after which it goes away as I bike), are not enough for me to go in for a stent on my one blockage. By the time you read this, you probably will have already undergone the angiogram with the possible insertion of another stent. Get all the precise details about what the blockage was (%) and exactly where it was. In some people, some stents are essential. In others, it is purely a matter of choice. For most people with stable angina it is a matter of preference since the stent does not prevent a heart attack or death. Meaning treatment by meds, lifestyle, and diet give about the same result. HOWEVER, each case is different, but the patient should be asking the doctor those questions as to whether the stent will prevent anything, or is only to provide comfort from angina during exercise. You should also ask him if you always need to stop when feeling slight discomfort. There is a term... the actual name... called walk-through angina... or warm up angina. Where you feel the slight discomfort, but continue. Not everyone has to stop exercise at the first sign of stable angina. So, even if you'v already had a stent inserted by the time you read this, you need to ask the doctor on your next visit, why he is putting in the last stent or the next one.. Is it only for discomfort, or is there another medical reason? Remembering that as we have discussed before, you have a calcium score over 900 while mine is under 100. So I don't want to suggest that everything that applies to me would be the same for you, in terms of the value and advisability of getting a stent today or in the future. Let us know how it all came out and the details of what was found and what was done. Did you ever get that second opinion from that additional cardiologist? You had mentioned your intent to do that a couple months back.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Steven72 Now, I've been referred to a urologist for a DRE, and I have a PSA re-test. The Dr. hesitated, but prescribed a two week course of Cipro to address the diarrhea and potential prostatitis. I'm on day 5 of the Cipro, and the diarrhea is improving. Do not rush to have your next PSA test any time soon after finishing your Cipro. If...and its a big if....If your prostatitis was caused by a bacterial infection, then even after treatment with antibiotics, it can take some time for the inflammation to calm down, such that you get a true PSA score. I'd wait many weeks, a month or more. Also please be aware that the majority of prostatitis is not caused by a bacterial infection and thus the antibiotic can't cure it. Sometimes the only cure is more \"time\"... Originally Posted by Steven72 Anyway, it all seems very weird to me... and of course, the a bad scenario here is that the previous Doctors should have investigated the discharge further, and because they didn't, it may well be Prostrate Cancer that has spread into my bowel - causing the diarrhea. Of course, the best case scenario is that the two are unrelated, the Cipro kills the bugs causing the diarrhea and the prostate infection. . Extremely....very extremely unlikely...that a prostate cancer has spread to your bowel and is causing diarrhea.. I wouldn't even be thinking about that. Far more likely you just had a bad meal at Chipolte...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Kens I was just diagnosed following a biopsy on July 14th, with results on July 30th. The pathology shows 1 of 10 specimens having 10% adenocarcinoma with a Gleason 3+3. My last PSA was on April 3, 2014 and showed 3.76. I am very interested in knowing what the common treatment modality is in this situation? Personally I am looking most seriously at the DaVinci nerve-sparing prostectomy right now, if I can convince my insurance company to do it... Please share any thoughts and recommendations, or insight...? ! You might include your past PSA history. Why were you given a biopsy? Include your past psa history. Was there something felt on a DRE? Unless there are other missing factors, if I was in your shoes, I'd do absolutely nothing. From what you have given us, you are the prime example of someone who could do no treatment. Instead, just do AS... sit back and see what happens in a year or two or five. Most men in your situation could do nothing and end up living to age 85 or 90 without ever treating their prostate cancer. They'd be just like the other 80 year old men, over half of whom die with prostate cancer, but from other causes. Seriously, move very very very very slowly on this. Take 6 months or a year before making a decision about treating this low grade prostate cancer. Listen to the following discussion/interview between two highly respected experts in the field http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 11 minutes long. I don't see how you can listen to that and still feel the need to take action right away. Apparently you are new to all of this, only having your results for a few days. I can assure you, at this point you know almost nothing about the subject. If you did, you be amazingly more hesitant to do anything quickly. Certainly in ZERO rush to come to any decisions. You could sit back, read up and study for the next year, and be in no more danger than you are now. If after a year, you decided to make a treatment choice, it would almost certainly be just as effective a year from now, or even two years from now, as it would be today. You also need to learn far more about the side effects. Far too many men underestimate the side effect from surgery. Only a minority of men return to full sexual function (like it was before), after having surgery of any type. You need to be very precise on the definition of what constitutes a usable erection. Many doctors will give out glowing numbers of the percentage of their patients who have full function. It can be very different than the patient's definition. That difference lead to much disappointment after surgery as expectations are not met. The same hold true for the definition of continence. What you consider continence may not be the same as the doctors definition. If you take a good deal of time, you will begin to understand the actual reality of what to expect after surgery or other treatments.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Omar1968 This is my first post to this forum. I am 46 years old, and I was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma (acinar, not otherwise specified) Gleason Pattern: Primary 3, Secondary 3, Total 6 PSA 4.82 This was my first and only PSA Number of cores positive: 2 Total number of cores: 22 Proportion of prostatic tissue involved by tumor: 5% I have seen three surgeons, Any information you can share with me will be greatly appreciated as I attempt to make a decision. #1. Slow down. You say you have been \"recently diagnosed\"... What was the date of your diagnosis and what was the date of your psa test. Did no one suggest that you do a follow up psa test instead of just proceeding to the biopsy? Either way, I'd want a follow up psa test to confirm what your true psa result is. Frankly they should have done a second psa test before doing the biopsy... unless they also felt something on your DRE exam. Now, I'd still like a 2nd psa test.. because your true psa could be 1 or 2 instead of 4.82. #2, Anyway they did a biopsy. Did they give you any reason why they did 22 cores? That seems excessive for a 1st biopsy. Makes it all the more likely to find something... even a insignificant prostate cancer. Which brings up the 2 cores at only 5%... Actually had they done the more normal 12, it is probable they would have had 1 positive core at 5%... A Gleason 6 in one core at 5% would seem to be a very good case for AS... Especially if your true psa turned out to be only 1 or 2. #3... Certainly before I'd be making any decisions, I'd be sending in my slides to another institution for second analysis. We had recent person here, given a Gleason 8 score (3+5) who turned out to be a Gleason 6 (3+3)... (he sent his to John Hopkins and they couldn't imagine how he got a 5 reading) #4. . Slow down ( I know I said that twice) You only get one shot at this. If they take out your prostate, there is no going back. Again, why didn't they retest your psa, and what reason did they give for doing 22 cores? I'm trying to take the conservative angle on this because often men get into the \"get it out quick\" mode. You could do as each surgeon suggested... do watchful waiting... perhaps for 6 months or one year, while you gain a better feel for the whole subject matter and then make a decision after that time period. It appears that if all the surgeons think that AS is reasonable option, that they don't sense a need to rush. I don't either.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tattlebaum Because of a rising PSA (it was 2 for eons and a routine annual test and retest was 6 and 7) my PCP sent me to a urologist. DRE was unremarkable. A biopsy was done. 12 cores, 2 positive, one at 5% and the other at 10%. Gleason 3+3=6. No other information. Only another PSA in 6 months is planned. The urologist suggested I see an oncologist, my PCP didn't think that was necessary. Is there anything else I should be doing at this time, except waiting 6 months for another PSA and DRE? Been reading as much as I can about it and there's so much conflicting information... . You should include the date you had the recent test and retest. Specifically, how long was the time between those two tests? That is important. Also what if anything were you given between the two tests? In other words... if the time between the two recent tests was insufficient for a inflammation to have calmed down, then your psa of 6 and 7 might be abnormal for you and your true psa may still only be 2 or 3. So let us know the time between the two tests. Often doctors recheck only a month or less after getting one higher psa.... then if its still high they whisk you off to the uro who finds a low risk Gleason 6 that would have been better if it were not discovered... Or perhaps your doctor waited 3 to 6 months for the next psa test. Let us know.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by vaportrail I'm a little bit hesitant about getting a biopsy. I don't like the idea of bacteria from my colon getting introduced into my prostate and blood stream. . If you wait 4 months and you're still up near 5.6 then you will be doing a biopsy. I don't think anyone questions that. Done properly, with some antibiotic ahead of time, your risk of a bacterial infection is quite low. About 1% or so. No need to worry about spreading cancer during a biopsy. Originally Posted by vaportrail I was doing good losing weight on testosterone. I shed 15 pounds without much problem. But now I'm gaining it back... I have a lot of other old injuries, that prevent me from exercising. Makes it really hard to for me to get back into shape. In your mid 40's its about time to be considering a significant change in your diet anyway, or you'll face a future of weight gain. With some real change, you could lose that 10 pounds you've regained, though not as fast as you put it back on. Do your old injuries prevent you from doing a low-impact sport such as cycling? I find cycling to leaves me without pains, yet burns a lot of calories and does great things for one's heart. BTW, the very same dietary changes that are best for your prostate are also the best for your heart (and weight loss), and you are much more likely to die from heart disease than prostate cancer (even if you get prostate cancer). All in all, chances are very good you don't have prostate cancer. Good to wait 4 months before a retest. Anything less and you may not give time for a inflammation to calm down.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tattlebaum Initial test was on the 23rd, follow up on the 29th. I was given nothing between the dates additional to the statin and Omperazole I always take. Of note, one test is \"immunoassay Roche COBAS\" with a 4.0 as the high normal limit and the other unnamed with 4.5 as the high upper limit. What's with that? OK, according to some, if you are over 60, then 4.0 is the upper \"normal\" limit, and for some past age 60, they call 4.5 the \"normal\" limit. They are both talking about the same group of men. Don't pay too much attention to those differences. I could give you respectable doctors who suggest everyone over 2.5 should be given a biopsy. Much of the science about prostate cancer is all over the map. NOW, after a year or so, you getting your normal physical, etc, with a PSA....which came in at 6.... followed by ANOTHER... PSA test only SIX days later. Then referred to a urologist... who then gave you a biopsy. Well, in my book, that is sheer insanity. Waiting all of 6 days to do a followup test is madness.. Uninformed madness. If... IF a inflammation of any origin is boosting your PSA from 2 or 3 up to 6, there is little chance that inflammation will have subsided in only 6 days. You may not even be aware of the inflammation. Called asymptomatic prostatitis. Very common and can easily boost a PSA from 2.0 to 6.0 or 7.0. I have gotten a 7.5... only to have my current PSA at 3.3 Then after that silly confirmation test, you are put aboard the biopsy express train. Yes, they did come up with a Gleason 6, something that you may have been better off never having been discovered. Now you are officially a \"cancer patient\" whereas if they had waited 3 to 6 months to retest your PSA, there is a good chance it would have been back in the 2.0 to 2.9 range. Which of course would not have entitled you to a biopsy. Then you may well have lived the rest of your life officially without prostate cancer. You see, the majority of men have prostate cancer before they die. Except most of them are undiagnosed and are never affected by the prostate cancer. But now you are on board the train. Called upon to make decisions and to worry. First off all... do nothing for now. Wait 6 months and retest your PSA. At the very least, if you can't stand it, wait 3 months and retest. Nothing bad is going to happen by waiting 6 months. Good chance your PSA will be back under 3.0. Now, listen to this interview. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 Listen to all of it, especially focus on minute 8:00 onward. Speaks about those who get spikes in PSA, only to return to normal range if they only wait. But too often, by then, they were forced to under go a biopsy and now they are officially a \"cancer\" patient....faced with the mess of treatment options, for a \"cancer\" that in most men, would never have caused them a problem. We can't know for sure what you'll find in 6 months, but for now, you have been prematurely put through a unnecessary biopsy procedure. That they found some \"official\" prostate cancer, in Gleason 6.... small amounts, only makes you a normal man of age 62. Be assured of this' you will die with prostate cancer, as will most men. Only a good portion of men are never aware of it and are unaffected by their cancer. Too bad you had a biopsy after two psa's only 6 days apart. Now wait.. Retest in 6 months... and don't spend much time worrying. Very good chance you are just fine. A fair chance.. you'll never need treatment. A very small chance you'll ever die of prostate cancer. Remember now, my PSA was 7.5 and now it is 3.3",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tattlebaum Because of a rising PSA (it was 2 for eons and a routine annual test and retest was 6 and 7) my PCP sent me to a urologist. DRE was unremarkable. A biopsy was done. 12 cores, 2 positive, one at 5% and the other at 10%. Gleason 3+3=6. No other information. Only another PSA in 6 months is planned. The urologist suggested I see an oncologist, my PCP didn't think that was necessary. Is there anything else I should be doing at this time, except waiting 6 months for another PSA and DRE? Been reading as much as I can about it and there's so much conflicting information... . You should include the date you had the recent test and retest. Specifically, how long was the time between those two tests? That is important. Also what if anything were you given between the two tests? In other words... if the time between the two recent tests was insufficient for a inflammation to have calmed down, then your psa of 6 and 7 might be abnormal for you and your true psa may still only be 2 or 3. So let us know the time between the two tests. Often doctors recheck only a month or less after getting one higher psa.... then if its still high they whisk you off to the uro who finds a low risk Gleason 6 that would have been better if it were not discovered... Or perhaps your doctor waited 3 to 6 months for the next psa test. Let us know.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman So after having a cardiac catheterization 2 months ago with 2 stents inserted, to clear blockage sq, I'm having another one this morning. Had a very slight tightness in my throat when I run, after about a minute, that goes away when I slow to a walk. Honestly I'm not sure if it's real, or in my head, because I am so hyper aware of every little sensation since the stents were inserted in June. In fact, it's so slight, that I told the Dr if I wasn't looking for it, I wouldn't even notice it. Each case is different. I exercise 6 days a week for the last 3.5 years. That is over 1,000 episodes of exercise. I have felt angina on about 998 of those days. Again your situation may have other details, but simply feeling a bit of angina in your arms, neck, jaw, or chest is not unusual for someone with some blockages. It normally falls under the category of \"stable angina\". If it happens when you are not exercising, well that is another matter. My angina comes on about 3 to 4 minutes into my exercise routine, however if I were to start off faster or jog/run up hill, I could bring it on within 1 to 2 minutes. I am used to it by now and while I'd rather it were gone, the small temporary discomfort between minutes 3 and 16...(after which it goes away as I bike), are not enough for me to go in for a stent on my one blockage. By the time you read this, you probably will have already undergone the angiogram with the possible insertion of another stent. Get all the precise details about what the blockage was (%) and exactly where it was. In some people, some stents are essential. In others, it is purely a matter of choice. For most people with stable angina it is a matter of preference since the stent does not prevent a heart attack or death. Meaning treatment by meds, lifestyle, and diet give about the same result. HOWEVER, each case is different, but the patient should be asking the doctor those questions as to whether the stent will prevent anything, or is only to provide comfort from angina during exercise. You should also ask him if you always need to stop when feeling slight discomfort. There is a term... the actual name... called walk-through angina... or warm up angina. Where you feel the slight discomfort, but continue. Not everyone has to stop exercise at the first sign of stable angina. So, even if you'v already had a stent inserted by the time you read this, you need to ask the doctor on your next visit, why he is putting in the last stent or the next one.. Is it only for discomfort, or is there another medical reason? Remembering that as we have discussed before, you have a calcium score over 900 while mine is under 100. So I don't want to suggest that everything that applies to me would be the same for you, in terms of the value and advisability of getting a stent today or in the future. Let us know how it all came out and the details of what was found and what was done. Did you ever get that second opinion from that additional cardiologist? You had mentioned your intent to do that a couple months back.",

I suppose the original doctor who did the biopsy was a urologist, right? Who is the \"consult\" with? Type of doctor, and the reason for the \"consult\". Advised by the other doctor or just your own choice? Look, you apparently only found out your status yesterday. You have not yet heard from the second reading of the biopsy samples. Given your data...you really need to slow down. You can always be \"aggressive\" with any treatment you may choose, but right now all of this is happening too fast for a person who is new to all of this. Should the new reading hold the same, this cancer has been in you for years, not weeks or even months. No need to come to any quick decisions. Certainly no need to book a surgical date. A decision you make in a month will be more well thought out than some urgent decision you come to in the first week. Again, this cancer is years old... not just something that popped up in the last couple months.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman So i got home an hour ago, very uneventful. They found nothing. He told me that the stents were in place and working just the way we want them to, and they found nothing significant that needed to be stented. I asked, in that case, how should we approach the fact that i did have a positive echo stress test. He told me that the positive aspect of the stress test were not that significant, so just dont worry about it. I know that about 30% of stress tests are false positives. Also it was only the EKG that was abnormal, the images looked very good. So hopefully thats the end of it and i can move on. I'll talk with my cardiologist later today or tomorrow. Otago, you've given me some great questions to ask the cardiologist, expecially about whether to exercess through what appears to be stable angina (or my defective brain, not sure which. . Sounds like all went well. Nothing new discovered. Regarding exercising through angina, I want to emphasize I am not talking about gritting it out or pushing through the pain. I'm only talking about getting a minor feeling in arms, neck, jaw, chest.... where it just lets you know its there, but not causing you any significant discomfort. I refer it as \"notification angina\" (my name for it)... letting me know its there, but not causing what I would label as real pain or discomfort. By the way, if that same level of angina were to occur after the initial 15 or 20 minute warm up, then I would either slow to a cruise or stop. I get mine at the precise same points in my bike ride every day. Just like clock-work. On better days, it can be very subtle, but I am aware of the early symptoms. Of course I might drop over any day... but I don't think it likely. By the way, \"walk-through\" angina, as the name implies, means you just keep on going at a pace that doesn't increase the discomfort and then as dilation occurs and collateral circulation comes on, the discomfort goes away. However, it is also called \"warm up angina\"... where one exercises until feeling some angina... then stops for about 15 minutes... then resumes the exercise with the angina often resolved. Those names, \"walk through\" and \"warm up\" are the actual names used in the medical journals. The practice may or may not be advisable in your situation, however I do find that doctors are likely to want to reduce even the tiny chances of problems and thus can be very conservative in their advice. Even to the point of always saying \"STOP\" whenever you feel anything. The correspondence I have had with doctors who study this in Canada and in the UK, all tell me that exercise is a essential element in treating coronary artery disease. That and your diet, of course. Plus the statin you are already on. It will be interesting to hear what your doctor says.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by webster Hi all, Recently OH had his PSA checked which came back as 7.8, up from 2.2 4 years ago. He is only 57. This set in motion some tests, MRI and a TRUS biopsy that is scheduled in the next 90 to 120 days. Public hospital system wait list here. We did the MRI a couple of days ago. . Obviously this is a very stressful time and the wait for answers is very difficult to cope with for all of us. So how do I best support him through this process? It's so hard to see your partner going through this As is often the case, doing a biopsy after ONE jump in PSA is crazy, unless there are other factors. You report nothing that would indicate prostate cancer other than the ONE jump in PSA. I have had large jumps twice. The last one was to 7.5. I did not do a biopsy after that 7.5. Instead we waited either 3 or 6 months and then my last PSA was 3.3. Lucky for you the TRUS biopsy is scheduled 3 or 4 months from now. Two weeks before that appointment you need to get another PSA done. If it is around 3.0 or less you should cancel that biopsy. The notion that every jump in PSA should lead to a biopsy is madness. Retesting the PSA a 3 or more months later is the right way to approach this. You and your partner have allowed your lack of knowledge of this to cause you grief. When I was 57 my psa was about 2.7... Seven years later it is 3.3 But as stated, it has jumped twice, with one jump being 7.5. I no longer worry about jumps. We calmly wait and retest. Look at this thread http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...-My-PSA-Is-5.5 Then look at this thread http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...iopsy-Is-Today Then look at the same guy starting this new thread http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...s-of-My-Biopsy All that worry over nothing. Should have waited to retest his PSA in the first place, rather than jumping to a biopsy.",

      "Content": "Thanks for filling in the facts. Well, either way, it appears you have 7 positive cores out of 24 total. That alone would seem to exclude AS (active surveillance) However your actual psa might still be in question. You will be getting follow up psa test results for a blood draw on Dec. 13. That will be interesting, however a note of caution. You only had your \"24 core\" biopsy 17 days prior to that blood draw. Not only are you possibly waiting for any prior inflammation from prostatitis to calm down, but now you've thrown in another potential inflammatory issue, the 24 core biopsy. --\"Recent prostate biopsy can cause a significant increase in PSA values.\" --\"After biopsy, it may take a month or more before the PSA returns to baseline.\" source http://www.lexmed.com/docs/understanding_psa_test.pdf So lets see the result of the psa , but keep in mind those two potential influencing factors. 1. the fairly recent inflammation, and 2. the very recent biopsy. Might be you'll want to do another psa test in about mid January. It is still possible your true \"prostate cancer related\" psa is actually under 10. Can make some difference in your choice of treatment and level of concern, or even your feeling of urgency to treat. That you got all Gleason 6 is good. Might turn out lucky that you got that urinary infection that seems to have brought about the further testing of your psa.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by 35coupe I guess what you are missing is my PSA steadily going up. Why, I hope it is a benign reason but if it's not I will just be that further ahead on info. I go for another PSA Friday and I'm just finding out what I can in advance should I have another biopsy and it is cancer. You guys are always saying make sure you get plenty of info before making a decision so that's what I'm during. What's it hurt to get as much info up front so that I will have a better knowledge of what I will want to do and what surgeon I will choose.. I'm 69 Well I do understand some of it as I've done the same, though you seem to be getting real specific. You may be like me, with a psa that just jumps around. Looking back, you had a 5.9 which dropped back to 3.1 Mine jumps all over the place. I no longer worry. I've had one 7.3 and one 5.5. My last one was 3.3. I've gotten use to the game and no longer think about getting a second biopsy. Anyway, let us know after your next one what the result is. Looks like its been 3 months since your last, which was up a bit, but with a freePSA that was OK. If you get another 4.8, I'd probably wait another 3 months and test again, before I'd do another biospy. You have to be careful, if you biopsy enough on almost any man age 69, they'll find a cancer. Mostly ones you don't want to find. Like a 3+3 in one or two cores, with a low percentage of each core. Then what do you do? BTW, I'm 64 and my father had PCa... lived 25 years afterwards, died of other causes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Shittingbricks To start, how do I put info of my condition at bottom of page. I am 47, firefighter from the uk. PSA score 17.4. Gleason score 6, right lobe 1 core 2% positive out of 12, left lobe 4 out of 12, 8% As Mikla suggested, perhaps you can clear up your actual number of positive cores. We can understand the right lobe, 1 core at 2%, but out of 12? on the right side? or 12 total? Then you indicate 4 positive on the left side at 8%. I can't imagine that all 4 are each at 8%. Perhaps you can clear up what each of the 4 left cores are regarding their percentage (for example #1 @ 8%, #2 @15%, #[email protected] 18%, #[email protected] 22%) Originally Posted by Shittingbricks Urine infection triggered investigation, never had psa reading prior to this and had second psa after infection clear 17.2. Could you give us a timeline on that psa testing. Date of the first psa test, then how soon and how long you were treated with antibiotics. Then importantly the following questions-- #1. how long after finishing the antibiotics were you tested for the second time? #2. How long between the first psa test and the second psa test? Were you ever actually tested for a urine infection and was a actual bacteria found in that test? Or was it just assumed that your symptoms indicated a urinary bacterial infection so you were given antibiotics either for that or for both that and a potential bacterial caused prostatitis? You should understand that most prostatitis is caused by non-bacterial inflammation. Thus the antibiotic will not kill a bacteria that does not exist. And your inflammation that can be the cause of the spiked PSA will persist, often for a good deal of time afterwards. Months.... So you could have a low risk Gleason 6 prostate cancer along with a seemingly higher risk PSA score that is mostly not caused by your prostate cancer, but rather by your prostatitis. It can take considerable time for prostatitis to calm down and for the PSA to reveal its true level. IF your PSA were only 4 or 7 in stead of 17, then you might feel a bit less anxious. Though you still would have prostate cancer. But it may be fairly low risk that could influence your treatment choices or at least the feeling of being rushed to act quickly. Those doctors indicating you should wait, may be counting on your true PSA reading to be much lower than in the last tests. \" Biopsy showed prostatitis and chronic inflammation\"... Both can greatly raise your PSA results.",

You can always be \"aggressive\" with any treatment you may choose, but right now all of this is happening too fast for a person who is new to all of this. Should the new reading hold the same, this cancer has been in you for years, not weeks or even months. No need to come to any quick decisions. Certainly no need to book a surgical date. A decision you make in a month will be more well thought out than some urgent decision you come to in the first week.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Dom555 Hi all just new on here n really worried my husband is 48 and has had an enlarged prostate for a while now so he gets his levels checked regularly. Before Xmas his psa was 4 and has now jumped to 33. Can anyone tell me whether he's more likely to have this as we r waiting for an appointment with the urologist but the wait is killing us You should feel good that his psa jumped from 4 to 33 since Xmas. Prostate cancer would not cause such a rapid jump. This doesn't mean he couldn't still have some prostate cancer, only that the rapid jump up is almost certainly NOT caused by prostate cancer. The huge jump, plus his clear symptoms, indicate your fears about having a rapidly growing prostate cancer are highly unlikely to be the cause of the test result.",

Gleason score 6, right lobe 1 core 2% positive out of 12, left lobe 4 out of 12, 8% As Mikla suggested, perhaps you can clear up your actual number of positive cores. We can understand the right lobe, 1 core at 2%, but out of 12? on the right side? or 12 total? Then you indicate 4 positive on the left side at 8%. I can't imagine that all 4 are each at 8%. Perhaps you can clear up what each of the 4 left cores are regarding their percentage (for example #1 @ 8%, #2 @15%, #[email protected] 18%, #[email protected] 22%) Originally Posted by Shittingbricks Urine infection triggered investigation, never had psa reading prior to this and had second psa after infection clear 17.2. Could you give us a timeline on that psa testing. Date of the first psa test, then how soon and how long you were treated with antibiotics. Then importantly the following questions-- #1. how long after finishing the antibiotics were you tested for the second time? #2. How long between the first psa test and the second psa test? Were you ever actually tested for a urine infection and was a actual bacteria found in that test? Or was it just assumed that your symptoms indicated a urinary bacterial infection so you were given antibiotics either for that or for both that and a potential bacterial caused prostatitis? You should understand that most prostatitis is caused by non-bacterial inflammation. Thus the antibiotic will not kill a bacteria that does not exist. And your inflammation that can be the cause of the spiked PSA will persist, often for a good deal of time afterwards. Months.... So you could have a low risk Gleason 6 prostate cancer along with a seemingly higher risk PSA score that is mostly not caused by your prostate cancer, but rather by your prostatitis. It can take considerable time for prostatitis to calm down and for the PSA to reveal its true level. IF your PSA were only 4 or 7 in stead of 17, then you might feel a bit less anxious. Though you still would have prostate cancer. But it may be fairly low risk that could influence your treatment choices or at least the feeling of being rushed to act quickly. Those doctors indicating you should wait, may be counting on your true PSA reading to be much lower than in the last tests. \" Biopsy showed prostatitis and chronic inflammation\"... Both can greatly raise your PSA results.",

I guess these are questions the urologist will answer, but I'm just concerned. Thanks again. Yes... test vary and even when the lab is accurate, the psa can jump all over the place. I have had tests that jump from 3.5 to 7.5 and then back to 3.8 six months later. I've had several jumps like that. I do not run for a biopsy every time that happens or I'd be getting stuck with needles every year. My last PSA was 3.3. I've had tests of 7.5 and over 5.5. You simply don't understand the many causes of jumps in PSA. You don't even need to see a urologist now. Just wait a minimum of 3 months (6 months better)... and retest. Far better than getting 12 giant needles punched into your rear end.",

You'll be getting a lot of information in 20 or 30 minutes. The good thing about having to wait until Monday is that you can prepare a list of questions so that you get precise details I'm sure some where there is a good list online, of questions you should ask Perhaps someone here can find it and post it. Stuff that, after the appointment, will pop up in your mind, and then its too difficult to re-contact the doctor for those one or two additional questions. Clearly you had 10 to 14 cores taken. You need to know how many are positive What percent of each is positive The Gleason score of each I guess. I suppose you can ask for and obtain a copy of the entire report so you can discuss it and look up details as you gain understanding. I'm sure others here will give you more questions to prepare. Yes, the more I think about it, your doctor not being available today is a good thing for your eventual meeting such that you gain a full understanding by being more prepared with questions.

You also need to learn far more about the side effects. Far too many men underestimate the side effect from surgery. Only a minority of men return to full sexual function (like it was before), after having surgery of any type. You need to be very precise on the definition of what constitutes a usable erection. Many doctors will give out glowing numbers of the percentage of their patients who have full function. It can be very different than the patient's definition. That difference lead to much disappointment after surgery as expectations are not met. The same hold true for the definition of continence. What you consider continence may not be the same as the doctors definition. If you take a good deal of time, you will begin to understand the actual reality of what to expect after surgery or other treatments.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Gunrun Can you send his info to me? I am at my urologists office now waiting for the consult thanks. I suppose the original doctor who did the biopsy was a urologist, right? Who is the \"consult\" with? Type of doctor, and the reason for the \"consult\". Advised by the other doctor or just your own choice? Look, you apparently only found out your status yesterday. You have not yet heard from the second reading of the biopsy samples. Given your data...you really need to slow down. You can always be \"aggressive\" with any treatment you may choose, but right now all of this is happening too fast for a person who is new to all of this. Should the new reading hold the same, this cancer has been in you for years, not weeks or even months. No need to come to any quick decisions. Certainly no need to book a surgical date. A decision you make in a month will be more well thought out than some urgent decision you come to in the first week. Again, this cancer is years old... not just something that popped up in the last couple months.",

      "Content": "Well if you do discuss it with others, realize that at least half of them won't understand anything about it other than the word \"cancer\". They are as ill informed as most 50 year old men, prior to diagnosis, not knowing even what a prostate does. You might make up a list of 20 well known men who have been diagnosed over the past 10 years. Explain you have the same thing as those 20 men who are still alive and active in their lives and career. From politics, to military, to sports, to billionaires, the list is endless and famous. Puts the scary word \"cancer\" in context of specifically \"prostate cancer\". Explain that by age 80, about 3 of every 4 men have prostate cancer, often undiagnosed. Explain that 5 out of 6 men who get prostate cancer, don't die of it. The news if full of men who have been diagnosed and treated. Colin Powell, Rudy Giuliani, Warren Buffett, Sec. of State John Kerry, California Governor Jerry Brown, Yankees coach Joe Torre, Lakers coach Phil Jackson. One could go on and on with dozens more. Lots more Hollywood types who just don't make it public. Notice so many of those men are still in very demanding jobs, active, alive and planning on staying that way for a very long time. My own father, 25 years after diagnosis, died of old age at 88. Two of those above examples, in the news, John Kerry, no one even thinks about prostate cancer when he is seen. Same with Governor Jerry Brown. Only health issue in the news about Kerry is his wife and her own problem.",

(Though it may prove to produce a positive finding by mere chance) ----------------------------------------------------- December 18, 2013 | Turned 40 yrs. old July 9, 2014 | Had my yearly physical July 11, 2014 | PSA was 5.5 referred to a urologist July 29, 2014 | Urologist performed a DRE and found nothing August 19, 2014 | Biopsy recommended {not diagnosed with anything} ------------------------------------------------- How about simply waiting 3 more months and retesting the PSA... Again, perhaps there is something here that is not mentioned, but reacting to every raised PSA result with a biopsy is madness. Easily, very very easily, the PSA could be over 5 due to simple infection, even a asymptomatic infection or other inflammation that isn't even caused by bacteria. Biopsies are not NOTHING.. they are a real invasive operation to the prostate, with their own set of dangers as well as lingering effects. To simply get a high psa with no other symptoms or abnormalities, and quickly do a biopsy is inappropriate. But, too late now. Of course something could show up. That is always possible, but it is unlikely to be something that could not have waited 3 more months to be discovered... AFTER a second confirmation PSA was found to still be raised up to unusual levels. I would like to hear some alternative views to my stance.",

They'd be just like the other 80 year old men, over half of whom die with prostate cancer, but from other causes. Seriously, move very very very very slowly on this. Take 6 months or a year before making a decision about treating this low grade prostate cancer. Listen to the following discussion/interview between two highly respected experts in the field http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 11 minutes long. I don't see how you can listen to that and still feel the need to take action right away. Apparently you are new to all of this, only having your results for a few days. I can assure you, at this point you know almost nothing about the subject. If you did, you be amazingly more hesitant to do anything quickly. Certainly in ZERO rush to come to any decisions. You could sit back, read up and study for the next year, and be in no more danger than you are now. If after a year, you decided to make a treatment choice, it would almost certainly be just as effective a year from now, or even two years from now, as it would be today. You also need to learn far more about the side effects. Far too many men underestimate the side effect from surgery. Only a minority of men return to full sexual function (like it was before), after having surgery of any type. You need to be very precise on the definition of what constitutes a usable erection. Many doctors will give out glowing numbers of the percentage of their patients who have full function. It can be very different than the patient's definition. That difference lead to much disappointment after surgery as expectations are not met. The same hold true for the definition of continence. What you consider continence may not be the same as the doctors definition. If you take a good deal of time, you will begin to understand the actual reality of what to expect after surgery or other treatments.",

I'm getting the impression that your boyfriend isn't the kind of guy who had done a lot of investigation into all of this. Part of that investigation is knowing completely about the doctor who is going to be doing the surgery. Your boyfriend needs to know a great deal about the doctors past experience with robotic surgery. How many times has he done this surgery with a robot. 20 times.... 200 times.... 2000 times? At a minimum he needs to know those details. Sounds like he has made his mind up very very quickly. Not a wise thing to do. Hopefully he had gotten second opinions. Both about the type of treatment and if he actually needs treatment. Lastly, he (and you) may be in for a big surprise after surgery. Side effect are frequent and can last a very long time. Very often much more severe than many doctors will tell the unquestioning patient. Your boyfriend should know the statistics before undergoing surgery. There is a lot more to this surgery than simply curing the cancer. Usually there is no reason to rush into surgery. He has had this \"cancer\" for many years. It didn't just pop up suddenly. If he goes ahead without being knowledgeable about all aspects of this, he does so at risk of being disappointed or regretful. Perhaps he has done all his homework, but it doesn't sound like it.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by njs I believe the best (but definitely not perfect) way to compare surgeons apples-to-apples is to look at their positive surgical margin (PSM) rates stratified by pathological stage. For the handful of best surgeons in the world this is 2% or less for true organ-confined (pT2) disease and around 25-30% for non-organ-confined (pT3+) disease. As far as I have know, Samadi has not published his PSM rates. The best PSM rates I have seen are from Tewari (Cornell, but soon to moving be Mt Sinai) and Ahlering (UC Irvine) who have both published studies showing specific refinements in technique that have significantly reduced their PSMs. Although I don't believe he has published them, Dr. Allaf who is chief of robotic surgery at Johns Hopkins, told me his pT2 PSM rates were also sub 2% when I consulted with him. From his website \"The SMART Technique It should be emphasized that the SMART technique is an advanced technique that should not be performed early in a novice robotic surgeon\u2019s learning curve. Since 2003, Dr Samadi has performed over 2,000 RALPs, approximately half by this technique. In the 12 months since the final modifications were made to this technique in early 2008, he has performed more than 2,224 RALPs. We are able to achieve continence rates of 97% and potency rates of 81% at 1 year (in 193 and 169 patients, respectively) while maintaining a 4% rate of positive surgical margins. \" Now, one must be very careful when seeing data on both continence and especially potency rates. The definition of each is important. What constitutes a full erection widely varies. I seriously doubt he has 81% of his patients reporting that sex is just like before surgery. You need to ask for a very detailed and precise definition of these terms before accepting them as valid. Still he may be among the best surgeons around. Hard to tell.",

I was wondering if anyone has any insight or experience with in repercussions from letting their staff/employees know about their cancer diagnosis. What I am trying to make sure doesn't happen is that people get nervous about the long term viability of their jobs and they decide to leave. All I know I can do is explain the situation as clearly as I can and reassure them that this is a manageable condition. Thoughts? Well its a small town. Seems like word will get around regardless. If you go the route of full disclosure, you have to overcome the word \"cancer\", which to the uninformed means ALL cancers. You'd be surprised at how uninformed the general public is about prostate cancer. Aside from telling them that only 1 in 6 prostate cancer patients ever dies from the condition, you would do well to supply current day examples of men who are in the news... after surgery for prostate cancer and living a completely normal life. A few you might include 1. Secretary of State, John Kerry, who has to be the most busy man on the planet. He had surgery 11.5 years ago. (heck, he ran for President ... shortly AFTER... he had surgery.... what could be more demanding than running for president?) 2. Rudy Giuliani, check the dates, but it was years ago, and he is traveling all over the country. 3. Arnold Palmer, had surgery 18 years ago. 4. Former Sec. of State, Colin Powell, 11 years ago in 2003. The man is very active and busy today and was shortly after surgery. There are hundreds of examples you could pick from... sports stars, politicians, seems you can't pick up the paper without seeing someone new. You need to give these ongoing examples to impress upon the staff, that this surgery will less disruptive than something like hip replacement surgery. That the chances you'll still be alive in 10 years is about 95%. There may be local town examples. Frankly I don't personally know of anyone who has actually died from the disease in my circle of acquaintances. This surgery will be far less disruptive than heart surgery. Anyway... I'd let them know via other examples.",

So it is accelerating meaning there is cause for concern especially since recent MRI indicated cancer in both sides of your prostate now. Then again, throwing out the last one, as possibly induced by inflammation, the prior 3 PSA tests would indicate a deceleration. \"psa 5.2 at biopsy 02/2012 psa 3.8 02/2013 psa 4.4 06/2013 \"especially since recent MRI indicated cancer in both sides of your prostate now.\" There is reason to believe that a MRI back at the time of the biopsy may well have shown the same thing since 6 cores on that side could easily miss the cancer seen on the current MRI.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mikla My wife is awesome and very understanding, but having low energy and libido is taxing on her and me. So I am a bit stuck... I am currently thinking that this would be the best plan: 1. Stop smoking 2. Lose some weight and improve diet 3. Exercise more (I certainly have the time) 4. AS for six months and re-access Age 55, DOB 11/1957, 6'2\", 240# 08/29/2013 Biopsy: 2/12 positive (RLM,RLA), <5%/core, Gleason 3+3 ! I wouldn't even consider being treated now if I had your numbers. I'd wait and keep tracking your PSA, which according to you was probably about 3.8 in earlier tests and now in the mid 4 range. If it keeps advancing then do another biopsy in a year. I don't think I'd bother fishing around with a additional biopsy. I mean, the sampling is such a small portion of one's prostate that to have any certainty you'd have to do about 100 cores. Simply getting another 10 or 12 is fractional confirmation at best. You could randomly grab 55 year old guys walking down the street and come up with a portion who have Gleason 6 in one or two cores at 5% or greater. Take a look at this excellent measured discussion of the subject by two well known urologists. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 Delay is not always bad, even if you later seek treatment. Now, in the mean time, regarding your potential danger from PCa as well as your libido and your overall health. (btw, you didn't include your cholesterol panel, blood pressure and the other stuff such as your blood sugar readings which can be very important in pre-diabetes, Impaired Glucose Tolerance or Impaired Fasting Glucose etc). In your current state, you are probably 10 times more likely to die of heart disease than from prostate cancer, even if you never treat your prostate cancer. Lucky for you the changes in lifestyle needed are similar for all your problems, prostate cancer, heart disease, and even libido improvement without the injections. When is the last time you were fit? Smoking, obesity (over 30 BMI), and lack of exercise all affect your libido. Seriously, smoking is the most dangerous thing in your current health profile. You do know how bad it is for heart disease, right? You do know that all those blood vessels in your heart are not dissimilar to the blood vessels that bring blood to your penis, right? Unless you have fantastic genes you probably have a fair degree of typical heart disease in process. Greatly compounded by your long time smoking. All the damage your diet, lack of exercise, and smoking do to your heart are being done everywhere else your blood flows. The more radical dietary changes many prostate cancer subjects make are identical to those which studies have shown are best for your heart. BTW, they also bring about considerable weight loss in most subjects. A Trifecta of benefits. Dr. Dean Ornish has done published studies on this diet and how it affects PSA progression in those with diagnosed prostate cancer. How it slows the advance of your psa. UCSF (University of California, San Francisco) has a good overall nutrition guideline (64 pages) here... http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf Good for your prostate cancer advancement, excellent for your probable heart disease, and a near guarantee on weight reduction. A fairly good chance that following such a diet, along with a real exercise program, will do wonders for your libido even if you never take any more TRT injections.. You are 55, this may be a blessing in disguise for your overall health regardless of whether you treat or don't treat your prostate cancer. I'll tell you this, if you and your wife are concerned as you indicate about your libido, then you may face problems soon anyway, with all your other factors. Age, obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, etc. That combo leads to a good percentage of men losing it by age 55 or 60. OK, more than you asked for, but from your original post, you seem to have already come to many of the same conclusions. Time for action now, regarding all those lifestyle changes that will absolutely be beneficial to your future health. Your wife will be supportive and no doubt she could use some of the same lifestyle changes. If you like, I could suggest a few books to look into.",

Again, perhaps there is something here that is not mentioned, but reacting to every raised PSA result with a biopsy is madness. Easily, very very easily, the PSA could be over 5 due to simple infection, even a asymptomatic infection or other inflammation that isn't even caused by bacteria. Biopsies are not NOTHING.. they are a real invasive operation to the prostate, with their own set of dangers as well as lingering effects. To simply get a high psa with no other symptoms or abnormalities, and quickly do a biopsy is inappropriate. But, too late now. Of course something could show up. That is always possible, but it is unlikely to be something that could not have waited 3 more months to be discovered... AFTER a second confirmation PSA was found to still be raised up to unusual levels. I would like to hear some alternative views to my stance.",

I just wanted to interject something about this issue of being able to get back onto TRT after one chooses to get treatment for prostate cancer. Your statement follows from Mikla's statement in his original post as follows \"The minor complication is that I have low testosterone and have been getting 100mg testosterone/wk IM and it had significantly improved my energy level, mood and libido.

If you take 100 men who go on AS during which they give up TRT and compare them to 100 men who take some form of treatment for prostate cancer, I am betting that those who go on AS have a far greater chance of having a superior sexual experience relative to those who undergo treatment. After all, even if one goes on AS, and drops their TRT, they still have the ability to use all the enhancements available to those who undergo treatment, with the possible exception being the TRT. Nothing is more likely to affect one's sexual performance than the various forms of prostate cancer treatment. So, I'd just not want Mikla to think that undergoing treatment, then getting back on TRT, is the best idea for improving libido or improving sexual performance. Quite the opposite is more likely given all the data and stats. Of course individual cases are unique, but the overall numbers are clear in regard to this issue.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mitchden Based on my repeat biopsy, I have 1 or 2 cores that are Gleason 6 (3+3) less than 5% of the tissue. I hope to have Dr. Epstein's \"second opinion\" report by the end of the week. Assuming that Dr. Epstein confirms the Gleason (3+3), I will try active surveillance. The reason I say try is because, I need to override the psychological stress of knowing that I have low-grade cancer that is not going away. I will try meditation and thanks to \"Tall Allen\" Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction. Lets see what Dr. Epstein says. If he comes back with 1 or 2 cores at Gleason 6...less than 5%, then its time to put this on the back burner. At age 66, with your PSA, you would be fairly normal. Just that they happened to hit something. If, and its a big if, Epstein confirms that, then I'd place about 10% of my concern on my prostate cancer and about 90% on living a optimal lifestyle for my coronary artery disease. I know it doesn't have the big \"cancer\" attached to it, but it is the chief issue, much as it is for most men diagnosed with Gleason 6 prostate cancers. Best of all, its also something that every man can take positive action on. Right now, things seem to be going your way. Keep us informed. We always like to hear Epstein's second opinions on slides. He's kind of like God on these issues... all knowing",

      "Content": "Your boss may be as unfamiliar with prostate cancer as the average public. I would tailor the message to not make it sound like it is CANCER!!!.... For some all cancers fit into one box and precede death. Consider ways to introduce it via the many other well known men who have it and have fully resumed their activities in high profile busy jobs.. There are dozens and dozens of good examples. Who is busier than Sec. of State John Kerry? I'll tell you who, John Kerry when he was running for president in 2004. Right in the middle of running for president, he has prostate cancer surgery. Then after a period of time he is back on a grueling campaign schedule that would kill most men. General and Sec. of State, Colin Powel., Robert De Niro at age 59 had surgery. Arnold Palmer, Warren Buffett, the list goes on and on. There are hundreds of well known men you can use as example to make it clear it is not much more disabling than many other operations or accidents. My point being that for much of the uneducated public you need to introduce the \"cancer\" as not typically being something like they think of most cancers. I don't know your job, but I can't imagine if you were in a car crash that they would fire you for taking some time off. I think the bigger issue is for them to not think of you dying down the road, or being unable to do your job in the future.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lukasnyc Guys what do you think I should do about that other doctor that my father went to about 4.5 psa. He didn't recommend any test. Should I seek legal advice ? I am angry that he didn't tell him to repeat psa sooner nor he did any other test to figure out why psa is above normal. . You need to slow down. Prostate cancer is very slow in almost all cases. You are way off base in your assessment of the original doctor. You have not included your father's entire PSA history, but for the doctor to not act on a initial 4.5 psa test is rather normal. In fact under some criteria 4.5 is still considered normal at age 64. http://www.medicinenet.com/prostate_...igen/page3.htm Not doing a biopsy after ONE 4.5 reading is good medicine. Doing a biopsy at the drop of the hat, the first time someone gets a 4.5 would be unwise. There is ZERO reason to contact legal help. His doctor acted well within the standard of care. In fact he probably did a good job by NOT rushing to a biopsy based on one 4.5 psa test. As others have indicated, we have no idea what his real data is. the \"7\" could be 7 positive cores, or it could be 3+4= 7 Either way there is no rush for immediate appointments or decisions. Calm down, this is all going to take a very long time. There is every reason to believe your father has overwhelming odds to live well into his 80's, and die of something unrelated to prostate cancer. My father, diagnosed \"late\" at age 63, lived until age 88, dying of other causes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Flkjr Howdy. You seem to have a history of yo-yoing PSA. Your 7.3 in 2006 was followed by a 5.0 in the same year and a 4.5 the following. Why not wait 6 months (or even 3) and see if it indeed comes down again. If not then get that biopsy. Good luck and stay positive. I'd second this opinion. Even if it does drop back to around 5.0, then depending on how \"enormous\" your prostate is, you may or may not go ahead with a biopsy. At least you will have confirmed the PSA at 5.0 or perhaps 8.0, which might make a difference in how you approach treatment if you decide to do anything. Of course, the fact that you had a negative biopsy back in 2006 doesn't mean there wasn't some cancer back then. So if you are comfortable, give it 6 months or 3 months, just in case some \"itis\" or inflammation is driving the PSA up to 8.0. My psa jumps around more than yours. Have had 7.5 and 5.4 followed by going back under 4.0 and now down under 3.5 I no longer jump to biopsies after a jump up... but if I had the 7.3, followed by your 8.0... and that 8.0 was confirmed, then I'd do another biopsy just to see what is going on. BTW, at age 67, getting up once a night seems more normal than abnormal.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mikla My wife is awesome and very understanding, but having low energy and libido is taxing on her and me. So I am a bit stuck... I am currently thinking that this would be the best plan: 1. Stop smoking 2. Lose some weight and improve diet 3. Exercise more (I certainly have the time) 4. AS for six months and re-access Age 55, DOB 11/1957, 6'2\", 240# 08/29/2013 Biopsy: 2/12 positive (RLM,RLA), <5%/core, Gleason 3+3 ! I wouldn't even consider being treated now if I had your numbers. I'd wait and keep tracking your PSA, which according to you was probably about 3.8 in earlier tests and now in the mid 4 range. If it keeps advancing then do another biopsy in a year. I don't think I'd bother fishing around with a additional biopsy. I mean, the sampling is such a small portion of one's prostate that to have any certainty you'd have to do about 100 cores. Simply getting another 10 or 12 is fractional confirmation at best. You could randomly grab 55 year old guys walking down the street and come up with a portion who have Gleason 6 in one or two cores at 5% or greater. Take a look at this excellent measured discussion of the subject by two well known urologists. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 Delay is not always bad, even if you later seek treatment. Now, in the mean time, regarding your potential danger from PCa as well as your libido and your overall health. (btw, you didn't include your cholesterol panel, blood pressure and the other stuff such as your blood sugar readings which can be very important in pre-diabetes, Impaired Glucose Tolerance or Impaired Fasting Glucose etc). In your current state, you are probably 10 times more likely to die of heart disease than from prostate cancer, even if you never treat your prostate cancer. Lucky for you the changes in lifestyle needed are similar for all your problems, prostate cancer, heart disease, and even libido improvement without the injections. When is the last time you were fit? Smoking, obesity (over 30 BMI), and lack of exercise all affect your libido. Seriously, smoking is the most dangerous thing in your current health profile. You do know how bad it is for heart disease, right? You do know that all those blood vessels in your heart are not dissimilar to the blood vessels that bring blood to your penis, right? Unless you have fantastic genes you probably have a fair degree of typical heart disease in process. Greatly compounded by your long time smoking. All the damage your diet, lack of exercise, and smoking do to your heart are being done everywhere else your blood flows. The more radical dietary changes many prostate cancer subjects make are identical to those which studies have shown are best for your heart. BTW, they also bring about considerable weight loss in most subjects. A Trifecta of benefits. Dr. Dean Ornish has done published studies on this diet and how it affects PSA progression in those with diagnosed prostate cancer. How it slows the advance of your psa. UCSF (University of California, San Francisco) has a good overall nutrition guideline (64 pages) here... http://cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutrition_prostate.pdf Good for your prostate cancer advancement, excellent for your probable heart disease, and a near guarantee on weight reduction. A fairly good chance that following such a diet, along with a real exercise program, will do wonders for your libido even if you never take any more TRT injections.. You are 55, this may be a blessing in disguise for your overall health regardless of whether you treat or don't treat your prostate cancer. I'll tell you this, if you and your wife are concerned as you indicate about your libido, then you may face problems soon anyway, with all your other factors. Age, obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, etc. That combo leads to a good percentage of men losing it by age 55 or 60. OK, more than you asked for, but from your original post, you seem to have already come to many of the same conclusions. Time for action now, regarding all those lifestyle changes that will absolutely be beneficial to your future health. Your wife will be supportive and no doubt she could use some of the same lifestyle changes. If you like, I could suggest a few books to look into.",

My cancer was present in the nerves of the prostate. It is thought that traveling along the nerves is one of the ways it can spread. If your first ever biopsy was the indicated 49 core one, that is most unusual and I doubt 1 urologist in 50 would do that. Unless there were other indications that set you apart. Or that your 6.96 PSA was a very large jump from your prior history which you may not have included. BTW, whether or not the original poster has a infection is most often not the reason a PSA can be spiked by inflammation. The majority of PSA spikes caused by inflammation are not due to a bacterial infection. Prostititis has many causes, most of which are not infections. The original poster shouldn't leap at a saturation biopsy. Certainly not without first waiting to see if the PSA falls back down. I'm guessing your PSA going up and staying at 10+ was the driving force to finally do surgery. I don't think anyone would second guess that. However our original poster is far away from that. Look at what he says \"Biopsy (9.10.2013)-12 core -negative , left lobe acute and chronic inflammation\" Goodness, acute and chronic inflammation. That alone would could easily drive a PSA up to 5+, EASILY. He should calm down, follow up the psa in 6 months and put saturation biopsies out of his mind. As we all know, we don't want to discover every darn Gleason 6 that is residing in men's prostates. Other wise 3 out of 4 men would never reach age 85 without having their prostate removed or radiated. Hopefully a new test is around the corner that will separate indolent PCa from dangerous PCa.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH The random element here is HOW much time it took to double. If X represents several years, it may not be any cause for alarm. But if it is over just a year, that would probably warrant a visit to a urologist. I disagree. I think it would warrant a second PSA test, after a minimum of 3 months wait. At 2.6 psa there is little risk in simply waiting 3 to 6 months to retest. I mean, what is the urologist supposed to do? I am assuming the individual already had a DRE. If so, then the urologist can do the following 1. do another DRE 2. give the patient some antibiotics and take another PSA test in a few weeks...knowing that less than half of prostatitis cases are bacterial, thus subject to being helped by antibiotics. 3. go ahead with a biopsy at a PSA of 2.6, knowing that many people have short spikes in PSA, equal or greater than a 1.3 jump. 4. Or simply tell the patient to wait 6 months and re-test, knowing that in 98% of cases there is no danger in waiting for that next result. So, in most cases such as this, why even see the urologist after just one minor jump in PSA? Perhaps the only sound reason is to alleviate fear and worry, but realizing that neither of those two items will be solved by seeing the urologist, unless perhaps he goes ahead with a premature and unwarranted biopsy without waiting for a second PSA test after a reasonable amount of time.",

And I can't help but feel at times that if I could do AS for a year or two, that another solution might appear. What did Dr. Carter advise? Was he full-on suggesting you needed treatment now? You have a mixed bag of age, moderate psa, and very minimal positive cores. Actually only 2 out of 26 cores from the two biopsies. LESS THAN 5% each. Not even a close call in my book. You can't get much lower than that. I'd wait, keep my prostate, and do AS for a good year or so, while keeping a eye on the psa. Very unlikely that doing a treatment down the road would be inferior to doing it now. In the mean time, you get the use of your prostate which is not insignificant. Listen to this video if you hadn't already seen it in a prior link... only 11 minutes long. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804988 BTW, your most important family history is your father.

And I can't help but feel at times that if I could do AS for a year or two, that another solution might appear. What did Dr. Carter advise? Was he full-on suggesting you needed treatment now? You have a mixed bag of age, moderate psa, and very minimal positive cores. Actually only 2 out of 26 cores from the two biopsies. LESS THAN 5% each. Not even a close call in my book. You can't get much lower than that. I'd wait, keep my prostate, and do AS for a good year or so, while keeping a eye on the psa. Very unlikely that doing a treatment down the road would be inferior to doing it now. In the mean time, you get the use of your prostate which is not insignificant.

In agreement with Eichler\u2019s meta-analysis, two recently published studies critically reviewing the optimal biopsy strategies have further supported the use of extended 10- to 14-core biopsy schemes as the new \u201cgold standard\u201d for first-time prostate biopsy [30, 31]. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'd leave it up to the urologist to suggest it, rather than thinking it would certainly improve the chances of discovering cancer.",

I would not expect equal results from every center and every surgeon performing surgery. http://urology.jhu.edu/newsletter/prostate_cancer53.php Also note the definition used by the famous Dr. Walsh. \"significant long-term problems with urinary control\" (defined as needing to change a pad more than once a day).\" I'm not arguing for one treatment or another, only that the patients need to understand the definitions of the terms. A few years ago, a NYTimes article was about how the leading cause of dissatisfaction was due to inaccurate expectations that men had going into surgery.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate So, the two therapies sort of equal out. Many of the posters on this forum are glad that they did surgery, as the removed prostate can be fully assessed and that gives them peace of mind. . Regarding incontinence, a important issue to Jigger, I don't think the two therapies \"equal out\"... I'd say there is a much greater incontinence risk for many months with surgery and that there is also a much greater long term risk with surgery for incontinence. For about 1 out of 6-7 or so it remains to some degree very long term. Of course we don't yet know his actual numbers. (number of positive cores, percentage of each involved, 4+3 or 3+4...how many at 3+3 etc. During his appointments he should also ask about brachytherapy as that Allentown center indicates they also do that. It does not say if they do both low-dose brachy and high-dose brachy. Often with brachy they also include some external beam radiation for extra assurance. Trigger needs to ask those who do the radiation or brachy, how many of these procedures they have done and how many times each week they do them. Take notes on yellow pad... many many notes.. Exactly who is doing the treatment and how many times. If they say we have such and such results regarding incontinence, ask for definitions of what they mean. Some definitions consider 1 pad a day to be a acceptable definition of not having continence. I don't consider that a success and I'm guessing Trigger doesn't either. Don't rule out going farther than Allentown (depending on your insurance coverage). Here is a little discussion of the types of brachytherapy from a center at Temple University's Fox ... not that far down the road from Allentown http://www.fccc.edu/cancer/types/pro.../implants.html Lots of choices depending on those issues each man considers most important. The skill and experience of the doctors is critical. I'd surely drive a hour or two for someone I thought was best.",

Had they waited a bit, your PSA would have gone down, as evidenced by your subsequent results of 3.1 and 3.3... Which BTW fit nicely with a enlarged prostate. No matter what your April 2nd PSA score reveals, you should not jump. Look at that prior 5.9 that fell to a 3.1 a few months later. At age 69 you are way too cranked up about your fear of prostate cancer. Your odds of dying of prostate cancer are very low. OH and aches and pains at age 69..... join the crowd.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by NYC GMAN Over almost two years, I had two, 50 core biopsies that showed small Gleason 6 cancer in just three cores. Post-op it turned out to be Gleason 7 (3+4). I\u2019ll never know what a 12 core biopsy would have revealed, but I am glad I did the saturation biopsies and fortunate to have done the surgery when I did. My cancer was present in the nerves of the prostate. It is thought that traveling along the nerves is one of the ways it can spread. If your first ever biopsy was the indicated 49 core one, that is most unusual and I doubt 1 urologist in 50 would do that. Unless there were other indications that set you apart. Or that your 6.96 PSA was a very large jump from your prior history which you may not have included. BTW, whether or not the original poster has a infection is most often not the reason a PSA can be spiked by inflammation. The majority of PSA spikes caused by inflammation are not due to a bacterial infection. Prostititis has many causes, most of which are not infections. The original poster shouldn't leap at a saturation biopsy. Certainly not without first waiting to see if the PSA falls back down. I'm guessing your PSA going up and staying at 10+ was the driving force to finally do surgery. I don't think anyone would second guess that. However our original poster is far away from that. Look at what he says \"Biopsy (9.10.2013)-12 core -negative , left lobe acute and chronic inflammation\" Goodness, acute and chronic inflammation. That alone would could easily drive a PSA up to 5+, EASILY. He should calm down, follow up the psa in 6 months and put saturation biopsies out of his mind. As we all know, we don't want to discover every darn Gleason 6 that is residing in men's prostates. Other wise 3 out of 4 men would never reach age 85 without having their prostate removed or radiated. Hopefully a new test is around the corner that will separate indolent PCa from dangerous PCa.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH The random element here is HOW much time it took to double. If X represents several years, it may not be any cause for alarm. But if it is over just a year, that would probably warrant a visit to a urologist. I disagree. I think it would warrant a second PSA test, after a minimum of 3 months wait. At 2.6 psa there is little risk in simply waiting 3 to 6 months to retest. I mean, what is the urologist supposed to do? I am assuming the individual already had a DRE. If so, then the urologist can do the following 1. do another DRE 2. give the patient some antibiotics and take another PSA test in a few weeks...knowing that less than half of prostatitis cases are bacterial, thus subject to being helped by antibiotics. 3. go ahead with a biopsy at a PSA of 2.6, knowing that many people have short spikes in PSA, equal or greater than a 1.3 jump. 4. Or simply tell the patient to wait 6 months and re-test, knowing that in 98% of cases there is no danger in waiting for that next result. So, in most cases such as this, why even see the urologist after just one minor jump in PSA? Perhaps the only sound reason is to alleviate fear and worry, but realizing that neither of those two items will be solved by seeing the urologist, unless perhaps he goes ahead with a premature and unwarranted biopsy without waiting for a second PSA test after a reasonable amount of time.",

You didn't mention whether he did the psa test (blood draw)... right before he did the DRE or possible right after the DRE. Or was it done a week or so prior? As Chuck said \"In the 48-72 hours PRIOR to the test: * do NOT allow a doctor to perform a DRE (digital rectal exam)\"",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by 35coupe So my PSA was 4.36 and 34.4% free. The main doctor said I do not need to see him for another year. For me that means never. These PSA test for me generate more harm in anxiety then good. You're about 71... Your PSA is a steady \"bit high\"... with slightly higher than normal gyrations (like mine). Free PSA is great. The biggest problem you seem to be having is TOO MANY PSA tests. Waiting a year seems just fine. It would seem you risk very little should you ever get diagnosed as having PCa six months later than otherwise. As you have posted in the past, responding to one of my posts, if you keep letting them look via a biopsy, they'll eventually find something you don't want them to find. Instantly you become a person with \"cancer\" and are on a much more frequent protocol even if you choose AS. Right now, in your 70's chances are very high that if you never took another psa test ever, that prostate cancer would not shorten your life. However, like me, you'll probably keep doing it yearly. My last two times were 2.8 and 3.4, but in the many preceding years I was as high as 5.5 and 7.5 and one freepsa just under 20%... BTW, are you, or have you ever been on a statin..such as Liptor (atorvastatin)... That can affect your psa somewhat. If you are a normal 70+ year old man, your risk from heart disease is many times higher than any risk from PCa. I am also comforted by the fact that my father was diagnosed at age 63, \"too late\" for surgery, but lived 25 more years, dying of something else. There is such a range for this disease.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by jronne 56 years old, recently diagnosed last week with prostate cancer. Looking for any feedback regarding robotic radical prostatectomy at the Kaiser Santa Clara location. Anyone with recent prostate cancer experience with other Kaiser locations, Stanford or UCSF would be appreciated also. First of all, you don't need to rush. Seems the program at Kaiser, Santa Clara is run by someone with a fair amount of experience https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.or...=About+Me&to=1 However being in Kaiser, Northern California, you have the right to go to any Kaiser doctor you choose, from San Jose, to San Francisco, to Walnut Creek, to Sacramento. Take some considerable time finding out who is best before you make a choice. You could also do brachytherapy, which I believe is all done in Roseville for Northern California. Kaiser Nor Cal began doing robotic surgery about in 2005 or 2006. Must be a few doctors who have hundreds of such surgeries under their belt. You must ask not only how many they have done, but also how many they do each week vs someone only doing 1 or 2 each month.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JimT Age 57 Routine Checkup. 3/6 PSA 4.95 Recheck 3/11 PSA 3.69 Referred to Urologist. Recommend Biopsy. Due to reading and family history. (father he was 94 at time, pasted 3/31 unrelated to his prostate cancer.) Instructions: 4/8 Ciprofloxacin take two, day prior, two day of and two day after. Enema night before and 2 hours morning before procedure. 4/9 Biopsy This consisted of shot in hip (antibiotic). Then laying on table while doctor inserted ultrasound in rectum. Two numbing shots were administrated, one left and one right. Then 18 samples were taken, 9 on left and 9 on right. 4/16 Test result were negative. Was told it possible that it could be there. Its possible your high PSA might just be a high PSA.. Jim, your example is classic for the abuse of the system... Taking a PSA blood draw, getting a slightly high number, 4.95, then the doctor foolishly ordering retesting only 5 days later.. Wait it gets worse. In just those 5 days it drops from 4.95 to 3.69, yet the doctor refers you to the urologist. The urologist, also being overly aggressive, goes ahead and schedules a EIGHTEEN core biopsy. You have been mishandled and mistreated. Any reasonable primary care doctor would have waited a minimum of 3 months to take a second PSA reading. Then any sensible urologist would have told you to calm down.. possibly take a course of antibiotics... more likely just wait 3 to 6 months... and ONLY then take a second PSA test... BEFORE going ahead with a biopsy. And why 18 cores? who knows. Stay away from these doctors. They are excessively fast on the draw. Next thing you know, they'll go out of their way to find a single 5% core of Gleason 3+3=6 and have you in the operating room removing your prostate.. Unless you have left something out of your story, you just went through a unnecessary procedure.... not to mention the needless concern. Now, I don't know your family history, but given that your dad died at 94, just like mine at 88, of other causes, that in no way excuses a ultra aggressive move to do such a fast biopsy based on such flimsy PSA results. You'd do well to keep track of your next PSA.. Very possibly it will end up being right back where your prior PSA tests were before this latest pair were taken. Watch out. Don't simply follow the doctors without questioning what they are requesting. Best line in your post \"Was told it possible that it could be there.\" Sure, just like it could be there in most men your age... EXCEPT, we don't want to find it in everybody. The majority of men with prostate cancer, die with it, never having been diagnosed or having it affect their life. You may have prostate cancer right now. I may have it right now. Nevertheless, they jumped the gun on your biopsy. (you might give us the rest of your PSA history prior to these last two tests. If you didn't already know it, PSA results can jump around wildly, and can jump up and back down in only a few months. Such swings are very very very common. They are not reason to suddenly biopsy unless other factors are involved, such as a unusual DRE)",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Jim! With a PSA that went down in 26% in 5 days I would suspect that one of the 2 assays was incorrect. Question: On 3/6 at your \"routine check-up,\" did your MD do a DRE? If yes, did he do the DRE before having your blood drawn? If \"No\" & \"No\" did you engage in sexual activity within 48 hours prior to having your blood drawn? (No need to post your answer, these questions are attempting to identify a cause for your initial elevated PSA) I think your MD was justified in ordering a 2nd PSA five days later. His rationale was likely to either validate the 1st finding or negate it. ! It has to be said that there are PSA results that leap up and down even if 1. No prior DRE was performed in the hour(s) before the blood draw. 2. No sexual activity in the prior 24 hours. 3. No bacterial infection is present. There is something called asymptomatic non-bacterial prostatitis that, as the name implies, isn't felt, and isn't curable with a antibiotic, yet it can raise your PSA from 3.5 to 5.5 or 7.5, just like that. And if allowed time to settle down, can leave you back at 3.0 or 3.5 a few weeks or perhaps a few months later. Asymptomatic prostatitis is more common than bacterial prostatitis. In short, \"seemingly nothing\" can often make a PSA jump several points. I do not think there was any good reason to retest in only 5 days. And after testing, seeing a drop of 1.26 in only 5 days, should have been a clear indication to allow some more time for a 3rd test. Like another 3 months. No need to even refer the patient to a urologist and certainly no reason to do a 18 core biopsy. As I mentioned before, it would be nice to know Jim's prior PSA history.",

But he can't see me until Mid Dec. EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY I AM AFRAID I AM AT MORE RISK OF ESCAPING THE CAPSULE. Trying to see a RO at MSKCC, wont even give me an appt until they get the reports (easy) scans (easy), slides (still at Hopkins) and a TE Parametric MRI which they say i ccant have until end December because it needs to be 7-8 weeks after biopsy. More time lost. And how is it that i get to see two rock star surgeons who have done over 5000 robotic surgeries each, within days, but i cant see anyone at MSKCC for over a month? How does that work? I'm so confused, scared and depressed. Logically i know, i have time. But still. Its understandable how confuse and depressed you are. You've been through quite a scary episode. However you have one of the foremost experts in the nation telling you to relax a bit \"I actually got to speak to Dr Epstein, and he was very emphatic that it was a G6 and that I had months to decide on how to proceed. \" You've got to trust someone... I'd trust him. As such, getting that December appointment at MSKCC seems quite reasonable and not at all risky to wait. The news about your downgrade is really amazing.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wjw What I'm suggesting is we shouldn't be offering false hope for high PSA results to readers of this blog without scientific evidence. Correct me if I'm wrong or off task here, or at least let this be a thread for discussion. I agree that we shouldn't be suggesting that a man who gets a 5.6 psa, might really only be a 3.4 psa, but for sex, or a 20 mile bike ride in the 24 hours leading up to the test. The DRE factor is a bit more probable to increase a psa, but still not in the magnitude that some imagine. I've read the possible differences before, but can't recall them now. First of all, the bike riding info is scant. Sex and especially DRE impact have some better background information. However I don't think sex + dre would normally raise a psa by a full point. However not all DRE's are created (done) equally ...ouch!. I throw biking in, not for the single recent rides, but more for a individual who may be a regular rider doing 100 miles a week...possibly setting up a over all greater inflammation. Even then its iffy, but I don't ride in the days leading up to a test. (I'm talking about men not yet diagnosed) However there is one category that can have huge impact on PSA scores. That is prostate inflammation, which in some cases may be called prostatitis. It can make large impact on PSA scores far in excess of the sex, dre, or bike riding. I always emphasize that potential impact as being the one to watch for. Having said that, you can very often have such a condition and not even be aware of it. Also, a simple round of antibiotics will have little to no impact on it much of the time. Only a minority of the time is it caused by a bacterial infection. Rapid retesting is often a failure because such inflammation can take considerable time to resolve. And the, men should be told that PSAs can simply jump around significantly. I've had two spikes of significant size. I can't remember the precise number without looking it up, but I had one a few years ago that after jumping up to 7.4, dropped back to about 3.8 when I retested in about 3 or 6 months later. In the interim I had taken no antibiotics.",

Either way, your PSA would probably have been 4.0 or more. Do you know your PSA history? The doctor was not wrong to do some extensive \"digging around\" in the exam. That is exactly the right thing for him to do before making you get biopsy. Right now you may want to get another urologist, but then he will have to re-examine your prostate again and you'll still have to get another PSA.. This time do it prior to the exam, and if possible long enough ahead of time for the new urologist to have the results when you see him for the exam. Then, he'll probably tell you to get a biopsy. Still in the long run, better to deal with someone you feel comfortable with. Whether your PSA is 2.8 or 4.8, with the nodule, they'll tell you to get a biopsy. Or, you can just forget all this and take your chances. Odds are good you'll die from something else before prostate cancer, if you have any, gets to you.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wjw What I'm suggesting is we shouldn't be offering false hope for high PSA results to readers of this blog without scientific evidence. Correct me if I'm wrong or off task here, or at least let this be a thread for discussion. I agree that we shouldn't be suggesting that a man who gets a 5.6 psa, might really only be a 3.4 psa, but for sex, or a 20 mile bike ride in the 24 hours leading up to the test. The DRE factor is a bit more probable to increase a psa, but still not in the magnitude that some imagine. I've read the possible differences before, but can't recall them now. First of all, the bike riding info is scant. Sex and especially DRE impact have some better background information. However I don't think sex + dre would normally raise a psa by a full point. However not all DRE's are created (done) equally ...ouch!. I throw biking in, not for the single recent rides, but more for a individual who may be a regular rider doing 100 miles a week...possibly setting up a over all greater inflammation. Even then its iffy, but I don't ride in the days leading up to a test. (I'm talking about men not yet diagnosed) However there is one category that can have huge impact on PSA scores. That is prostate inflammation, which in some cases may be called prostatitis. It can make large impact on PSA scores far in excess of the sex, dre, or bike riding. I always emphasize that potential impact as being the one to watch for. Having said that, you can very often have such a condition and not even be aware of it. Also, a simple round of antibiotics will have little to no impact on it much of the time. Only a minority of the time is it caused by a bacterial infection. Rapid retesting is often a failure because such inflammation can take considerable time to resolve. And the, men should be told that PSAs can simply jump around significantly. I've had two spikes of significant size. I can't remember the precise number without looking it up, but I had one a few years ago that after jumping up to 7.4, dropped back to about 3.8 when I retested in about 3 or 6 months later. In the interim I had taken no antibiotics.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon I consume approx. 2200 calories per day. Of that I restrict fat to around 100g, of which 50% comes from olive oil, avocados. I never eat junk food, other than a 6\" veggie sandwich from Subway on rare occasions. I eat red meat about twice a month. My meals mostly consist of fish, vegetables, whole grain bread, green tea, fruit and red wine. Other than this PC I am in great health for 67. I also power walk for 8km, 6 days a week weather permitting. Do you realize that your diet is 40.9% fat? A little olive oil as a substitute for other more dangerous fats is OK, but recently people have been given the idea that olive oil is a health food. That to use olive oil on this and that is \"adding\" health to ones diet, vs using it simply replacing other more dangerous fats. Meaning using olive oil instead of bacon may be better for one's health, but actually trying to add in olive oil is not like adding in a health food. I may be misinterpreting your understanding and use of \"healthy fats\" as it regards prostate cancer. Usually, the men getting better results from eating more \"healthy\" fats, are deriving it from the substitution effect... taking away the meats, cheese, dairy, etc... For such men, they are better off getting their fats from olive oil etc... Just saying that \"adding\" olive oil for prostate cancer and even more so for heart disease, is a idea that has become oversold and has folks almost taking extra olive oil as it were a supplement. I think getting natural fats in their own package... like avocados and walnuts... is great, but using amounts of oils never seen in nature, may more than intended. Like eating a orange or a apple, is quite different than drinking a 12 ounce glass of juice. Off hand, I don't think any diet with over 40% of the calories coming from any fats is beneficial. Seems most of those thought to be beneficial for prostate health aim for half that amount regardless of the source. However I'm always open to new proof or indication of such.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon I consume approx. 2200 calories per day. Of that I restrict fat to around 100g, of which 50% comes from olive oil, avocados. I never eat junk food, other than a 6\" veggie sandwich from Subway on rare occasions. I eat red meat about twice a month. My meals mostly consist of fish, vegetables, whole grain bread, green tea, fruit and red wine. Other than this PC I am in great health for 67. I also power walk for 8km, 6 days a week weather permitting. Do you realize that your diet is 40.9% fat? A little olive oil as a substitute for other more dangerous fats is OK, but recently people have been given the idea that olive oil is a health food. That to use olive oil on this and that is \"adding\" health to ones diet, vs using it simply replacing other more dangerous fats. Meaning using olive oil instead of bacon may be better for one's health, but actually trying to add in olive oil is not like adding in a health food. I may be misinterpreting your understanding and use of \"healthy fats\" as it regards prostate cancer. Usually, the men getting better results from eating more \"healthy\" fats, are deriving it from the substitution effect... taking away the meats, cheese, dairy, etc... For such men, they are better off getting their fats from olive oil etc... Just saying that \"adding\" olive oil for prostate cancer and even more so for heart disease, is a idea that has become oversold and has folks almost taking extra olive oil as it were a supplement. I think getting natural fats in their own package... like avocados and walnuts... is great, but using amounts of oils never seen in nature, may more than intended. Like eating a orange or a apple, is quite different than drinking a 12 ounce glass of juice. Off hand, I don't think any diet with over 40% of the calories coming from any fats is beneficial. Seems most of those thought to be beneficial for prostate health aim for half that amount regardless of the source. However I'm always open to new proof or indication of such.",

You are citing blood pressure and heart rate. Those numbers are fine, normal, but don't give any protection from prostate cancer. As to your cholesterol being 1.1, which equals 42.5 under the American system (1.1 mmol/l = 42.53674 mg/dl) If you are speaking about the normally stated \"total cholesterol\", then you are one of the most unusual men on the planet. I have never heard of a man having a total cholesterol of 1.1 mmol/l You must be referring to some other \"portion\" of your cholesterol. HDL, or LDL http://www.onlineconversion.com/cholesterol.htm Look, your total fat intake is still 40.9% It may or may not hurt or help your outcome with prostate cancer, but I don't think anyone I've read has advocated running your fat intake up that high by adding in extra olive oil. Olive oil is not a health food. Its not horrible food, just not something you'd want to consume more and more of for the sake of health.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Foilingfool2 Hi, I am new here and hope to get some opinions. I started getting my PSA checked 3 years ago when I turned 50. My first check was 0.3 and my DRE was normal. A year later my PSA was 0.6 and my DRE was normal. I am now 52, and just had my most recent check. My PSA is now 3.4. I did have a colonoscopy on Jan 12 and my PSA test was on Jan 28. I see my GP next week. I will likely head to the urologist as well. Very worried, as expected. I don't agree that you should be ready to get a biopsy. The most likely explanation for your significant rise in one year, is a inflammation or \"itis\" of some sort. Could be from a bacterial infection or it could be from nothing in particular. Unless the doctor does a DRE and feels something unusual, then I think the best advice is to wait at least 2 months and retest. You don't even need to take a antibiotic unless some test shows something. Watch out that someone doesn't give you a antibiotic and then retest in a couple weeks. Even if there was some infection, testing too soon after the antibiotic doesn't allow time for the situation to calm back down. Lots and lots... most inflammation is not caused by bacteria and will not respond to the antibiotic. Prostatitis has many causes. I've had my PSA jump up and down many times.. AS high as 7.5. My last test was back to 3.3. I would definitely retest before doing a biopsy. When you see the doctor(s)... ask them if it would be prudent to wait and retest. If they insist on a biopsy now, ask them why. BTW a infection or simple inflammation can be happening without you feeling anything. Asymptomatic, yet causing a 2.8 rise in your psa test. A recent colonoscopy could have set in motion the factors that could lead to a inflammation. That is different than the method wherein a DRE actually releases more psa from direct pressure or agitation. Let the doctors give you their best estimate of the odds of how likely the psa rise is caused by prostate cancer. Ask them what are the odds that waiting a couple months to retest would endanger you.",

      "Content": "Lots of issues going on. Missing from your two recent PSA tests is the time frame. How far apart were the two PSA tests? How many days was the weekend sex before the 2nd PSA test. Also, very important, what is your past history of PSA tests. Prior years, dates and PSA values in those prior years. I would think extensive sex without ejaculation might very well have a impact. So we really need a more precise timeline and your PSA history over the past years. PSA values can bounce all over the place. More in some people than others. BTW, there is lots of types of \"sex\". Which could also make a difference. I can think of some acts between consenting adults that could exacerbate the impact. Your enlarged prostate would also add to the values. Then you have the Androgel. How long have you been taking that? That can lead to a enlarged prostate, can't it? Regarding that 40% chance. Seems high from some sites I see. One place I see 29% chance. http://www.lef.org/protocols/cancer/..._cancer_07.htm There may be many other probability tables. Anyway, give us your PSA history.",

      "Content": "Well, ideally you would have been better served by having him tell you to wait a few days or a week for the PSA blood draw. If that was easy for you. Either way, your PSA would probably have been 4.0 or more. Do you know your PSA history? The doctor was not wrong to do some extensive \"digging around\" in the exam. That is exactly the right thing for him to do before making you get biopsy. Right now you may want to get another urologist, but then he will have to re-examine your prostate again and you'll still have to get another PSA.. This time do it prior to the exam, and if possible long enough ahead of time for the new urologist to have the results when you see him for the exam. Then, he'll probably tell you to get a biopsy. Still in the long run, better to deal with someone you feel comfortable with. Whether your PSA is 2.8 or 4.8, with the nodule, they'll tell you to get a biopsy. Or, you can just forget all this and take your chances. Odds are good you'll die from something else before prostate cancer, if you have any, gets to you. That is not a totally unreasonable approach, though some may object to such ideas.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon I consume approx. 2200 calories per day. Of that I restrict fat to around 100g, of which 50% comes from olive oil, avocados. I never eat junk food, other than a 6\" veggie sandwich from Subway on rare occasions. I eat red meat about twice a month. My meals mostly consist of fish, vegetables, whole grain bread, green tea, fruit and red wine. Other than this PC I am in great health for 67. I also power walk for 8km, 6 days a week weather permitting. Do you realize that your diet is 40.9% fat? A little olive oil as a substitute for other more dangerous fats is OK, but recently people have been given the idea that olive oil is a health food. That to use olive oil on this and that is \"adding\" health to ones diet, vs using it simply replacing other more dangerous fats. Meaning using olive oil instead of bacon may be better for one's health, but actually trying to add in olive oil is not like adding in a health food. I may be misinterpreting your understanding and use of \"healthy fats\" as it regards prostate cancer. Usually, the men getting better results from eating more \"healthy\" fats, are deriving it from the substitution effect... taking away the meats, cheese, dairy, etc... For such men, they are better off getting their fats from olive oil etc... Just saying that \"adding\" olive oil for prostate cancer and even more so for heart disease, is a idea that has become oversold and has folks almost taking extra olive oil as it were a supplement. I think getting natural fats in their own package... like avocados and walnuts... is great, but using amounts of oils never seen in nature, may more than intended. Like eating a orange or a apple, is quite different than drinking a 12 ounce glass of juice. Off hand, I don't think any diet with over 40% of the calories coming from any fats is beneficial. Seems most of those thought to be beneficial for prostate health aim for half that amount regardless of the source. However I'm always open to new proof or indication of such.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter Thanks for the article. I learned something new today: I never thought anyone diagnosed with cancer would not be diligently tracking their disease to make sure they stayed low risks. Anyway, 72% is an impressive number for a 13 years follow-up. However, looked like the 27% who \"disappeared\" were included in the no treatments required group so we really don't know what the real number was. . We have to wait until the study is formally published in a journal. The we can see how the 27% were counted , or possibly left out of the percentages we see that did not need treatment. I'm sure it will be in the news again when it is published formally. As to those who don't diligently track their disease, I find 27% to be about as expected. I doubt I would follow the frequency protocol that most AS programs prescribe. Here is UCSF's Active Surveillance Protocol at UCSF PSA Every 3 to 4 months Prostate ultrasound Every 6 to 9 months Prostate biopsy After 1 year * *If a patient's initial biopsy was performed outside of UCSF, an additional biopsy performed at UCSF may be recommended within a few months. Biopsies then may be performed every one to two years depending on other clinical findings. I'd be more inclined to the 2 year standard... whereas many programs have 1 year as their standard. Heck, before the diagnosis, look how long guys are going without biopsies... even though we know a huge percentage of them have existing, but undiscovered, Gleason 6 Only difference in those on AS and those undiagnosed is a lucky needle strike vs 12 misses.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Foilingfool2 Hi, I am new here and hope to get some opinions. I started getting my PSA checked 3 years ago when I turned 50. My first check was 0.3 and my DRE was normal. A year later my PSA was 0.6 and my DRE was normal. I am now 52, and just had my most recent check. My PSA is now 3.4. I did have a colonoscopy on Jan 12 and my PSA test was on Jan 28. I see my GP next week. I will likely head to the urologist as well. Very worried, as expected. I don't agree that you should be ready to get a biopsy. The most likely explanation for your significant rise in one year, is a inflammation or \"itis\" of some sort. Could be from a bacterial infection or it could be from nothing in particular. Unless the doctor does a DRE and feels something unusual, then I think the best advice is to wait at least 2 months and retest. You don't even need to take a antibiotic unless some test shows something. Watch out that someone doesn't give you a antibiotic and then retest in a couple weeks. Even if there was some infection, testing too soon after the antibiotic doesn't allow time for the situation to calm back down. Lots and lots... most inflammation is not caused by bacteria and will not respond to the antibiotic. Prostatitis has many causes. I've had my PSA jump up and down many times.. AS high as 7.5. My last test was back to 3.3. I would definitely retest before doing a biopsy. When you see the doctor(s)... ask them if it would be prudent to wait and retest. If they insist on a biopsy now, ask them why. BTW a infection or simple inflammation can be happening without you feeling anything. Asymptomatic, yet causing a 2.8 rise in your psa test. A recent colonoscopy could have set in motion the factors that could lead to a inflammation. That is different than the method wherein a DRE actually releases more psa from direct pressure or agitation. Let the doctors give you their best estimate of the odds of how likely the psa rise is caused by prostate cancer. Ask them what are the odds that waiting a couple months to retest would endanger you.",

      "Content": "Lots of issues going on. Missing from your two recent PSA tests is the time frame. How far apart were the two PSA tests? How many days was the weekend sex before the 2nd PSA test. Also, very important, what is your past history of PSA tests. Prior years, dates and PSA values in those prior years. I would think extensive sex without ejaculation might very well have a impact. So we really need a more precise timeline and your PSA history over the past years. PSA values can bounce all over the place. More in some people than others. BTW, there is lots of types of \"sex\". Which could also make a difference. I can think of some acts between consenting adults that could exacerbate the impact. Your enlarged prostate would also add to the values. Then you have the Androgel. How long have you been taking that? That can lead to a enlarged prostate, can't it? Regarding that 40% chance. Seems high from some sites I see. One place I see 29% chance. http://www.lef.org/protocols/cancer/..._cancer_07.htm There may be many other probability tables. Anyway, give us your PSA history.",

All that without a ejaculation would seem to... well, might do anything, perhaps even more than a single ejaculation after short sex. I'd probably be inclined to allow the Androgel to leave the system and for everything else to get back to a normal baseline, then retest. You'll have to do more investigation into how long the effects of Androgel take to #1, leave the system, and #2, result in a lowered PSA value. It could be that after stopping it still takes some time for everything to get back to a true state. Then avoid all the other bike riding and sex for several days, 3 to 5 and then retest. Might be two or more months from now, I don't know. You may well end up only back at 4.0 or 3.80 like in 2012, or you could stick at 4.2 or even higher. PSA readings jump around all the time.

BTW, my jumping around followed no obvious causation. You can have asymptomatic inflammations, non-bacterial in nature, that can boost PSA values a significant amount. As indicated, a course of antibiotics will not affect these in most cases. My true base value is probably about 3.5 to 3.8 and has been there for about 4 years. My age range during those tests was 59-63 Anyway, given my history and if I was you, I'd probably test again before doing the biopsy, if for no other reason to get a true picture of your PSA progression, even if you end up doing a biopsy in 3 or 4 months. Personally I'd avoid taking Androgel, but I do know there is much controversy on that subject (which I have not followed). Oh, also, this all assumes there was nothing unusual in your DRE.

By all means----you should make NO decisions on any possible \"treatment\" for 3 to 6 months. Allow time for your thinking and awareness to develop on the subject. Any doctor who is telling you that you need to decide sooner is improperly advising you. No reason you can't do AS for a while. See what happens. Very little risk in doing so, even if you eventually decide you need to be treated later. Don't let them stampede you into a decision, when even they don't know what is really going on in your prostate. --Oh, just realized I don't know the percentage involvement in that one positive core.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon There are few discussions about Hormone shots. Just wondering at what point people get them and how successful they are. Just a positive note about hormone therapy after radiation. My father at age 63 back in 1973,1974 was diagnosed with prostate cancer. There was no Gleason scoring system in place back then. Nor was there a PSA test at that time. Anyway, he was told it was no longer operable and that his only choice was external beam radiation. So he underwent 25 or more days of radiation. Either right after, or within a year or two he was placed on a drug called Diethylstilbestrol (DES) at a low dosage, 1 mg daily. He continued to take that hormone drug for about the next 20 years until I took him off it because of his legs swelling in his later 80s. Now, I don't know if the initial radiation killed all the cancer because there was no psa test until years later. But by that time he started getting 0.1 type results and they never changed. He died at age 88 of unrelated medical problems (mostly Alzheimers). So, did the DES keep the prostate cancer from returning or was it all killed by radiation. I don't know, but it is a positive story about the use of radiation and hormonal therapy. He outlived his prostate cancer for 25 years. DES is very cheap. It is no longer used much because in earlier larger doses it was thought to possibly cause some blood clots or such. My father took it for over 20 years with some side effects but no blood clots. He lived on the beach in Hawaii into his 80's So, stay positive about your future even though you have had some disappointments thus far.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PaulG Thought I'd introduce myself. I'm 53 and was diagnosed with prostate cancer just five days ago, so I'm just starting to learn about all this. (I'm reading the Dr. Walsh book now.) I will meet with my urologist again in two weeks to discuss treatment options in more detail, and I am seeing a different urologist for a second opinion soon after that. (Also, awaiting lab results on whether PTEN is absent.) My initial reaction is that prostatectomy seems best, given my age and life expectancy (dad lived to 87). But I'm keeping an open mind, and I'd welcome any suggestions. You are only five days into this. It is hard to emphasize enough the need for you to slow down as you slowly learn about this.. There is absolutely no reason to even think about coming to a decision in less than 3 months. Your level of comfort with the information you learn will impact your initial thoughts. What sounds fearful in the beginning will give way to far less urgency or need to act by undergoing early treatment. In a case with the details your's seems to have, the odds are that a decision made 12 months from now would have the same outcome as a decision made in 1 month. See your doctor, but be wary if he seems to be indicating treatment any time soon. Ask him about having a second reading of your biopsy samples by a independent expert. (see the thread http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...ologist-Report I see no reason why you won't live longer than your father. If you speak to your urologist about issues relating to outcomes... incontinence and especially erectile dysfunction, be absolutely certain you understand what his definition is. More often than not, the doctor's definition of usable erection is far different than that held by the patient. The majority of men who undergo surgery do not return to prior sexual function as they understand it. Lastly, there is value in hanging onto your prostate as long as possible. Don't let fear rush you into a hasty decision.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Now What? Why would we need a new urologist? His recommendation was surgery but supported us in watchful waiting upon our initiative. Other answers: my hubby is 57 years old, his dad is 90 and his PC is gone due to radiation last year. He has lived with it for many years and is healthy now. The (Chinese) herbs my husband is taking: HM Protect from Numedica, DIM Enhanced from Douglas laboratories, Rabdosia Prostate Formula, Arctic Ruby Oil (500 mg Calanus Oil).

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman and I came up with a result that of all the tissue taken, 6.6% of the total tissue was cancerous. So my question is, aside from the fact that I am being OCD and crazy, is this calculation meaningful? No Originally Posted by Pratoman I have been so vigilant, with regular testing over the last 5 years, a biopsy two years ago that was negative except for one core of high grade PIN, and PSA tests every six months for the last two years, and I am fearful that despite the care I took, I got it late, not early enough for full cure. But for that one core at 80%, you'd be looking at two Gleason 6 insignificant cores, from which many would opt for AS. Thus, you are just over the edge from possibly doing no treatment...to doing treatment. You are fairly early as these things go. Right now you are looking good. You discovered this early and everything appears to be in slow motion. Heck, you could probably wait a year or two and still not be too late. (I'm not advising that) Steady there.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tomseeley I'm totally new here. No clue at all what to expect or what to do. My PCP told me my PSA has risen suddenly, from 4-something to 7-something in 3 months. Why was your psa retested only 3 months after the 4-something? What was your psa history prior to the last two tests. Dates, psa result, .... the list including the last two. You want to make sure your jump up isn't just a blip unrelated to anything other than perhaps a mild inflammation of the prostate. Oh, in addition to your entire psa history, you might include your age. If your psa went from 4 to 7 in just three months, that sudden jump isn't likely to be caused by prostate cancer which is slow growing.",

He said, depending on what happens between now and then, he will possibly send me for a CT Angiogram to look for blockages. Just remember, if they find a blockage on a CT Angiogram and want you to come in shortly thereafter for a regular Angiogram, that you be very clear on not just automatically giving them permission to place a stent into a suspect artery \"just because they're already in there\". Huge numbers of unnecessary stents are placed in patients when there is no proof that they prevent heart attacks or deaths. The main reason for preventive stents is to alleviate angina symptoms, which you don't appear to have. Let us know the results should you do the CT Angiogram.",

Spread all over the place and ranging from 5% to 40% but with most of them being 20% or below. I don't think there is any need to rush, but I don't think you fall under any of the normal criteria for AS. Usually they limit AS criteria to 2 or 3 positive cores. I'm a big fan of AS, but with 8 positive cores and your age at 52, that may be taking more than a normal chance. You'd do well for 10 years, but with 35+ years to live I don't know that I would wait too long. Brachy seems like good choice if you get a experienced doctor and team at a well respected center where they do \"lots\" of these procedures every week.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter The interesting finding to me was that the Japanese men had more advanced and aggressive prostate cancers compared to the Russians. Yet current world prostate cancer statistics did not support that. Well, I hope I can see the actual study instead of only the abstract. The abstract said \" When adjusted for age and prostate weight, ASI men still had a greater probability of having GS 7 or greater PCa \" But the world prostate cancer statistics you refer to only include diagnosed cases and/or death rates from PCa, potentially leaving out a large number of the men in this study who, but for death from other causes, might never be diagnosed or have died from prostate cancer. I don't know the details, but screening for PCa in Japan is far lower. Thus naturally you'll have much lower incidence of PCa being reported. It may be that Russian and Japanese rates of screening are roughly comparable. Rates of new diagnosed cases per 100,000 (back in 2002) were similar in both Russia and Japan. http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11 ;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=6;ti= 2002$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1ji MAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuy j3qX39HWaQjEg;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwc NAVuyj2vXUZJKI0XHA;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=C ATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=377;dataMax=7 5860$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=-2.3805;dataMax=135$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$i nds=i110_t002002,,,,;i184_t002002,,,, And in this chart, you can also compare. http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content...3/F3.large.jpg Interesting. Lots of factors involved. I'd like to see the entire study with the details. It may be that genetics or especially the lifestyle of Japanese men forestalls their PCa from advancing to the point of obvious symptoms (diagnosis) or death. Gleason 6's and 7's may not advance so rapidly in those who have lived and eaten differently for their entire life. Of question is whether Western men, changing their diets after age 50, or after diagnosis will make a significant change in progression. I've completely altered my diet for over 7 years now but have no great faith it will do much more than perhaps delay my genetics. Thus far, no positive biopsy, but PSA still poking along at 3.5 to 3.8 (with some worrying leaps up here and there). That is why I watch and wonder about these types of reports. How come Japanese men can have considerable rates of PCa ongoing, yet have a mortality rate half of ours.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman He told me to stop the Cialis immediately, and he put me on a beta blocker, wants me back a week from Monday (i'm going away on vacation next week). He said, depending on what happens between now and then, he will possibly send me for a CT Angiogram to look for blockages. Just remember, if they find a blockage on a CT Angiogram and want you to come in shortly thereafter for a regular Angiogram, that you be very clear on not just automatically giving them permission to place a stent into a suspect artery \"just because they're already in there\". Huge numbers of unnecessary stents are placed in patients when there is no proof that they prevent heart attacks or deaths. The main reason for preventive stents is to alleviate angina symptoms, which you don't appear to have. Let us know the results should you do the CT Angiogram.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mitchden Is there a defined protocol for repeating a biopsy? The original pathologist said 1 core was cancerous with a Gleason 7 (3+4). My urologist says the protocol is to wait 6 weeks to 3 months after the original biopsy. I was hoping to wait a year. Six weeks.... yikes! Hmmm.... I don' know what the protocol is... but even for a simple repeat of the PSA test, 6 weeks would seem to be very rapid. You might ask him or the office where you can read up on that \"protocol\"... Or perhaps that is HIS protocol. I can't give you a answer, but anyone suggesting a brief 6 weeks sounds very unusual unless he has a study to show the value of such a rapid re-biopsy. I really don't know the answer as to what is appropriate. But I can't imagine any study showing 6 weeks or 3 months to be superior to 6 months or 1 year+. Keep us informed if you find a site giving the current protocol.",

I want it out....As is often the case, surgeons recommend surgery and may not suggest a second reading of your biopsy samples. Strange things have happened and been reported here from those who obtain a second reading of samples....John Hopkins etc. Have you seen anyone who specializes in radiation? It would seem almost 100% certain that a doctor who has done over 2,000 surgeries will suggest you do surgery....The doctor doing the surgery also advised my father to do radiation after he has healed from surgery because of the aggressiveness. . Oh this fact about being 1 year on hormone therapy makes this case different....It would seem almost 100% certain that a doctor who has done over 2,000 surgeries will suggest you do surgery. BTW, how many of the 2,000 surgeries were robotic?...I was making appointments for surgery and fortunately my wife told her oncologist about my diagnosis and he insisted I get a 2nd opinion from a prostate oncologist that he recommended before making any treatment decisions. It was the best move I ever made....My uro has done hundreds of open prostatectomies and recommended surgery, although he took a couple of hours to explain all of my options to me and did not push anything. He said that I had some time and that I should carefully weigh my options....The 13th biopsy at UCI showed 2 cores out of 25 positive, Gleason 6 less than 5%. The urologist recommended surgery and was certain that the cancer was contained....I'll bet out there, 90% of men would have just taken the first reading as fact.. and their urologist would not have recommended a second opinion. Then most would have been scheduled for treatment...surgery....Again, I hope he is getting the opinion of more than one doctor. Perhaps another doctor would suggest doing only the radiation without surgery....The urologist recommended surgery and was certain that the cancer was contained. I was making appointments for surgery and fortunately my wife told her oncologist about my diagnosis and he insisted I get a 2nd opinion from a prostate oncologist that he recommended before making any treatment decisions....I took the news like a champ, but slowly unraveled over the next few days. My uro has done hundreds of open prostatectomies and recommended surgery, although he took a couple of hours to explain all of my options to me and did not push anything....24 cores done, only one confirmed PC, the others showed atypical cells. My urologist recommended prostatectomy or radiation....I live in the EastBay and if I were not a Kaiser member, I'd probably head to UCSF. Keep asking around and I'm sure there are some top surgeons that some will suggest.. (if surgery is your choice)...The vast majority of Drs have their clients best interest at heart, but they all have their natural biases. Be your own advocate I agree, though it does appear that Dr. Kaul has been at it for some time.... doing robotic surgery http://link.springer.com/article/10....-0071-4#page-1 Including doing other surgeries with the same machine http://www.theoaklandpress.com/gener...ticular-cancer Would be interesting do know how many prostate removal surgeries he does each week with the machine....Given that you have 5% + 5% + 10% in your three samples....OUT OF 16, not 12, you'd seem to fit their criteria if the 3+4 became a 3+3 Give yourself considerable time to get a second opinion and at the same time start reading as much as you can about AS I assume you've only been dwelling on this for the past 6 weeks. As is often the case, surgeons recommend surgery and may not suggest a second reading of your biopsy samples....Originally Posted by dmm1987 My father has been on hormone therapy for about 1 year and his PSA is now a 0. I think at one point he mentioned his PSA was an 8 when he started the hormone therapy. The doctor doing the surgery also advised my father to do radiation after he has healed from surgery because of the aggressiveness. ....",
