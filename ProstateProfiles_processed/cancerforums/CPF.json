      "Content": "Greetings, This is a timely thread for me, as I am currently looking for a urologist in the Boston area. I'm 55 with a family history of PC (father and older brother); my PCP has been monitoring my enlarging prostate and rising PSA (up to 4.4 last month) for some years. At a follow-up appointment last summer, he felt a subtle asymmetry and recommended that I pursue it with a urologist. I went to one of his suggested names out here in the suburbs and was thoroughly dissatisfied with the experience. Besides looking for a professional with whom I can forge a productive relationship (I've been with my current PCP for most of 30 years and look forward to annual physicals), I want access to as many state-of-the-art diagnostic tools and therapies as possible. The urologist that I consulted offered neither. I've been primarily researching the Mass General and Beth Israel Deaconess programs and affiliated urologists (Googling 'hifu mass general' returned a hit to this forum, then I browsed around and decided to join). Mass General appears to have a bigger team, and offers the proton therapy option. BIDMC touts their 3T MRI machine, though I don't know that it's any more powerful (or capable) than MGH's. So I guess my question is, are there any particular advantages to choosing BIDMC (or Dana Farber, or others) over MGH? Thanks for the insights already provided in this forum, and any further input that you wish to share.",
