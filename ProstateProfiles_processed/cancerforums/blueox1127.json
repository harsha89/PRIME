      "Content": "Hi Mikla,I had my surgery done by Dr. Samadi and he swears that he does all his surgeries from start to end and has a real problem with surgeons running multiple operating rooms.I met with two surgeons before him and instantly new I wanted him to do my surgery.His staff has been with him for years and they all treated me and my family like royalty,I had a private room at Lenox Hill Hospital and everyone on the floor were Dr.Samadis patients,after the surgery when I was walking the halls ,every hour or so after, the people I saw were all going through the same thing I was.There were four of us that had surgery that day and we all had our own nurse,I was never left wondering about anything.Do not hesitate to contact him,even after I was home I e-mailed him personally and he allways responded within an hour,and I sent mine at 5 am!I dont when he sleeps.

      "Content": "While it may sound like a dream run from my signature after returning to work,I work in construction,things weren't as lovely.Having to do physical labor continence was a constant battle I spent half the day swearing and then when people asked what was wrong I eventually quit saying \"nothing\"and just said \"I peed my pants\"and they stopped asking,it actually was a little comical until you leave work and want to cry!Also after the beginning of September I would squirt or leak urine when I began to get an erection, which has improved and I find if I lay on my back it doesn't seem to be an issue.I realize from reading on this forum that I am quite fortunate in many regards but I sure do miss being normal.I limit everything I drink, caffiene and alchohol to very small amounts and followed everything my surgeon told me to do,I did nothing but walk around for six weeks and it seems to have paid off.Every one seems to recover at different rates and i wish you the best.

      "Content": "I too experienced increased leakage from doing kegals but I think I may have been overdoing them ,I cut back a little and did them with less intensity and saw improvement.I have noticed that most people on this forum recieved differing advice from surgeons on the amount of kegals to be done and all of us have had different results.I kept a log of the weight of my pads and the number of kegals to see what worked best for me,also the things you eat and drink can make a dramatic difference alchohol,caffiene and for some reason brown gravy had me leaking like a fire hose,learn what affects you and avoid until you regain control,hang in there and things should improve. mike",
