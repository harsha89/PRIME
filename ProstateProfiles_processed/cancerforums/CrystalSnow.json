      "Content": "It's been a long, stressful week and I'm back with a few more questions of you wonderful, experienced people! My stepdad saw two oncologists this past week and both basically gave him the choice to start chemo or Zytiga + prednisone immediately, concurrent with the Lupron injections (the first of which should also be this week). Wondering if anyone has any thoughts--assuming cost is not a factor. At first we were excited to learn about the prospect of Zytiga, mainly because of the hope of fewer side effects. But the more research I do into the trials, and subsequent studies, it seems like the chemo could still have an advantage over the Zytiga for men with his profile (PSA level, multiple bone mets, chemo-na√Øve, and symptomatic). This is the interesting, but very long, article: http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/861906_1 One other question: is Xtandi approved for use in castrate-sensitive patients? The oncologist mentioned a clinical trial he could potentially enroll in if he goes the chemo route first, but not if he goes the Zytiga route. It is comparing it to a placebo in castrate-sensitive patients. I know it is approved in castrate-resistant, but unsure if he could just be prescribed it otherwise. If so, going the study route seems needlessly risky due to the 50% chance of getting a placebo, and only being on the Lupron at that point. Thanks again for listening. He needs to make a decision asap, so any thoughts would be great!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Moonshadow Hi Crystal - I tried to open that link but could not. We will be meeting my dad's oncologist again after his first Lupron dose and subsequent radiation to determine next steps. He has a very similar bio as your step dad's but he is a bit older. We were very excited about the abireterone versus doxetacel route as well and so I'm curious to know about your findings. Thank you in advance I'm so sorry to hear, Moonshadow. Try going to medscape.com and search 'Abiraterone Acetate in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.' You need to register but it is free and easy. It's a long article, but page 5-6 have a good summary and results. Happy to chat more if you want to PM me...",

      "Content": "Hello All- My very young, healthy stepdad was just diagnosed with Stage IV prostate cancer at age 53. He is currently in a great deal of pain--mostly lower back where there are several large bone mets. We are all in shock but I'm spending all of my free time researching so we can make sure he gets the very best care and treatment plan possible. -PSA of 145. Ten days later the re-test was 161. -CT scan states 'lymph node, retroperitoneum' involvement -Bone scan shows extensive bone mets throughout his body (mixed type, lytic and sclerotic) -Biopsy: Prostate, right: Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 (Gleason grade group 3), involving 3 core fragments and approximately 5% of submitted tissue. Prostate, left: Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 (Gleason grade group 3), involving 5 core fragments and approximately 65% of submitted tissue. -PET Scan: awaiting results to see if there is any metastasis to visceral organs He started Casodex one week ago and we've been told he will start Lupron shortly. He has his first Oncology appointment on Monday (Kaiser insurance), and we have an appointment set up for a second opinion with the CU Cancer Center on Friday (has not been approved by Kaiser). I, obviously, have a million questions and thought maybe you wise souls could help me with a few of the most pressing. 1) I read the 2015 study that showed the survival improvement when adding Chemo at the outset of treatment, rather than waiting. I just came across the even newer study that showed a great improvement when starting Zytiga along with the hormone therapy. There was mention of there being less side effects than with chemo. Any thoughts or experiences? 2) I've also seen that some doctors prescribe Firmagon rather than Lupron. Is there a case to be made that this would be a better treatment option in his case? 3) Any thoughts on why prostate cancer with a Gleason score of only 7 (and incomplete involvement) has already metastasized so far throughout his body? From what I understand, this seems unusual, and might be further cause for fighting to see a top specialist who 'has seen it all.' Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated. I've already experienced a long, hard medical journey with my daughter so I'm not new to research and advocating, but cancer is all new to me. I finally had a good cry his morning and am ready to jump back into action. My best to all of you on this difficult journey--and thank you so much for sharing your time and knowledge. Best, Crystal",
