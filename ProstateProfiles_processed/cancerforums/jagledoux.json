It was my regular routine lab work with my regular GP who orders a PSA as part of his routine exam, when the reading came back high, he told me to go back to the Urologist. This is when the Urologist did another DRE and told me to return for a follow up PSA/DRE. If the PSA is still high then we will do the biopsy. I do have inflammation and am on Carduran 2mg and Cialis 5gm which has taken care of urine flow. The DRE was fine with no abnormalities.",

      "Content": "Hello, thanks for the info. I see a Urologist once a year. It was my regular routine lab work with my regular GP who orders a PSA as part of his routine exam, when the reading came back high, he told me to go back to the Urologist. This is when the Urologist did another DRE and told me to return for a follow up PSA/DRE. If the PSA is still high then we will do the biopsy. I do have inflammation and am on Carduran 2mg and Cialis 5gm which has taken care of urine flow. The DRE was fine with no abnormalities.",
