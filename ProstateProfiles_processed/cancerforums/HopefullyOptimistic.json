      "Content": "Gentlemen- I have been trolling these boards recently after my first inclination I might have pCA. I must say I am impressed by the amount of unselfish, sincere help offered on these boards and the level of educated, well thought out responses offered by it's members. I hope to return the same at some point. I was hesitant to post prior to having some clinical data to report and now I have same. I am a 64 y/o in reasonably good health. Smoked previously/ HPTN controlled with meds. My PCP has been watching my PSA over several years and suggested I see a Urologist when my level rose to 5.1 a few months ago. I had recently been experiencing some symptoms, urgency and less than ideal flow. My Urologist suggested a TRUS due to my PSA velocity. The results of my TRUS were as follows: Right Medial Base: Benign Right Medial Mid: Benign Right Medial Apex: Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 7 (3+4) involving approx 25% of the biopsy length Right Lateral Base: Benign Right Lateral Mid: High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia Right Lateral Apex: Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 6 (3+3) involving approx 15% of biopsy length Left Medial Base: Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 6 (3+3) involving approx 5% of biopsy length Left Medial Mid: Benign Left Medial Apex: Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 6 (3+3) involving <5% of biopsy length Left Lateral Base: Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 6 (3+3) involving <5% of biopsy length Left Lateral Mid: Benign Left Lateral Apex: Benign Subsequent the TRUS during my follow-up with the urologist, we spent about an hour going over the TRUS results and my new Dx of pCA. He placed me at an \"Intermediate\" risk due to the existence of the Gleason 7 ( he placed my DRE and PSA in the \"low risk\" category) and suggested an \"MRI with 3D imaging\" to furthur diagnose and check for possible extracapsular spread. He reviewed treatment options with me and felt I would be a good candidate for RP, however suggested I review/research all my options before deciding. He stated Both XRT and RP had a similar \"cure rate\" of 90-95% and mentioned RP to be the \"Gold Standard\". ( He's a surgeon.....) He did not try to force surgery over other tx options and offered referrals to other tx providers. He has performed \"over 500\" RP's and performs other DaVinci procedures on a frequent basis. ( including my wife) About a week later I had a \"MRI Prostate w/wo contrast w/ CAD and MPR\" Results: PSA 5.2 Prostate Meas: 5.0x4.9x4.5 cm Prostate Vol: 57.17 cc PSA Density: 0.09 Prostate capsule intact Lymph nodes: No suspicious or enlarged pelvic lymphadenopathy. \" There is no evidence for transcapsular extension or local regional disease\" End Report (There is much more info in this MRI report however I am not sure what all is relevant, or not. So I have attempted to summarize. ) Subsequent the MRI, he met again with my wife and I. I had 2 pages of questions.......... He said my stage is \"T1Gleason 7\". If there is an error in this stage explanation, it is probably mine, as I still don't completley understand this staging system Most of my questions were answered. He was very honest and forthcoming as far as I could tell. Again, he did not try to push me into a surgical remedy, however he did think I should make a decision within the next 3 months or so. BTW I asked if I could speak to prior patients. Another pt approx my age just happened to overhear our conversation and offered to talk to me. We spent an hour alone, in a closed room supplied by my doctor. he was 1 year post RP and he stated he would do it again. He was very frank about his experience, side effects, etc. I had all my questions answered by him. I felt I got an honest opinion. I have scheduled an appt with another Urologist specializing in pCA here locally at the Moffit CA center this Wed. and an appt with an Oncologist at another facility this Thurs. From my extensive reading on these boards describing pCA cases much more involved than mine, I remain cautiously optimistic. It is early on in my quest for answers, however I am currently considering either RP or CK.",
