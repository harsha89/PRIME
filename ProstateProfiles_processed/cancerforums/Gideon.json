      "Content": "I am pretty sure I am about to become a new member of this group. Its definitely a situation where I wish my membership was \"turned down\", but I am not sure that will be the case. Yesterday I had to have a biopsy because of a hardness on my prostate found during a DRE. The DRE was done a week ago so I had all week to look at the various stories from people and all the wonderful things written on the internet. Within days I had every symptom known to man. My hips hurt....completely disregarding that over the past 15 years I have had one hip replaced and the other broken which now carries a 20 inch titanium rod in it. In other words, my mind took over and I got crazy. My purpose with this post is hopefully to alleviate some fear for people like me who may be entering this unknown land. So on my first post, if I would be allowed, I'd like to say three things: 1. Everyone who is writing here is alive. I had this brilliant epiphany Saturday night. What more is there to say. The people giving you their stories are alive. 2. Of the hundreds of thousands of people who have this disease, only a small portion will share their success stories. I wish more would. If you put a dollar in the soda machine and a can comes out, you don't tell anyone. But if you have to stand and bang on that machine or reach your hand up in it to get your soda, you tell everyone. So goes life. When things work out you usually don't tell people. Does not mean that there are not thousands of people getting their soda every day. 3. Biopsy - I know each one is different - but for those going tomorrow or the next day, mine went like this. I asked the doctor for a valium so I could take it the day of. I did and it relaxed me. The ultrasound was invasive, but not painful. I was given three shots of lidocaine, that hurt less than anything I have ever had at the dentist. They gave me a few minutes to num up while they looked around with the ultrasound. Time to take the samples. It feels like someone snaps your arm with their finger. That might even be to much. I counted up to six and then back down from six each time i heard the sound from the device which is a quick click. I had some residual bleeding where the doctor applied some pressure with a gauze pad inside my rectum. This was the least pleasant part and my guess is it was an anomaly and most people do not experience it. After leaving, and the anesthetic wearing off I was a little sore for an hour. Just lay down, it goes away quick. Two hours later I urinated...fearfully after all my reading....and just urine came out. Nothing else. No cabernet, no rose, no sludge, no clots. I then defecated and about three small clots came out as expected because of my residual bleeding. The night was uneventful except because of my high water intake I got up about three times during the night to urinate. No blood at any time, no problem urinating. Morning, same thing. On my way to work now. I only write these things because there are a lot of horror stories. There should be more good stories. I do not even claim to know a thing about this disease, just what I have been through in the past few weeks. I hope it helps some one who is just starting out...like me...and feeling the fear of what comes next. I will try and keep up as things progress. Thank you all for your stories. Oh I am 53 years old, good health except for the hips but still do anything I want in terms of activity.",
