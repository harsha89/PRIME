I was told after examination that my prostate is large for a man my age, and it was a bit painful to his touch. I'm thinking it's good news, but the specialist wouldn't say so yet. He said he's yet to see PC in a man my age with no family history. He asked me to do an MRI just to be sure, and prescribed me a stronger dose of antibiotics (Resprim Forte) for the next few days. My MRI is next Thursday morning, and I see the specialist again on Friday morning for the results. I really appreciate everyone's support on here. It's the only thing keeping me sane.",
