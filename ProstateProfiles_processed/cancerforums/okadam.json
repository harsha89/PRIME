      "Content": "Yes, terrifying. Yes, bad experience. Probably worth having a medical review board double-check to be sure all procedures were followed correctly. There is a risk with all surgical procedures. I had to sign a form that said that I acknowledged that one of the possible outcomes was death. On the other, hand, a biopsy confirmed that I did, indeed, have cancer, and ultimately saved my life. Do I miss having an erection, sure, but there is more to my life than just that. I think I can still enjoy another 20-25 years without one--and I've been given the option of a technique that would allow me to create erections at will, but it's just not worth it to me. One year after surgery, life is great and I've have even found a partner that accepts for what I have, not for what I don't have.",

      "Content": "Yes, terrifying. Yes, bad experience. Probably worth having a medical review board double-check to be sure all procedures were followed correctly. There is a risk with all surgical procedures. I had to sign a form that said that I acknowledged that one of the possible outcomes was death. On the other, hand, a biopsy confirmed that I did, indeed, have cancer, and ultimately saved my life. Do I miss having an erection, sure, but there is more to my life than just that. I think I can still enjoy another 20-25 years without one--and I've been given the option of a technique that would allow me to create erections at will, but it's just not worth it to me. One year after surgery, life is great and I've have even found a partner that accepts for what I have, not for what I don't have.",

      "Content": "I was reading my morning meditations today and realized that 3 years ago today, I was in the hospital, recovering from my prostate cancer surgery. I know that when I was first diagnosed I was full of fear. I turned to this forum for advice and re-assurance. So glad that I did! I just want to share that my life is great. No sign of any return of cancer. PSA levels are negligible. Looking forward to a pleasant retirement in about a year. For newbies, get as much information as you can. Read books, talk to doctors, consult friends, share your concerns on this forum, it all helps! Best wishes on your journey. Adam",
