      "Content": "Thanks to all of you for the comments to this. This is new for me. I am usually concerned for someone else's health, not my own. The biopsy date is the 13th of May. Age 60, have always been very active but mostly in the woodworking trade, hiking, shooting et al. I don't believe I was ever screened specifically for PSA before. This LNP decided to have it done almost on impulse although along with a couple of minor stomach issues, I also mentioned I had a feeling in the end of my Urethra that was odd. Long story short, I don't have anything to match this against although I have already learned 11.1 is high. The Urologist found a hardness/firm spot on the right side which prompted him to set up the biopsy. Of course now, every single twinge/back spasm/\"pain\" immediately puts me into orbit - mentally. I am on Cipro right now because I had determined that at the very least (before the Urologist), I had a UTI. Since I have started taking that, most of the accompanying original symptoms have gone to zero or near zero. I don't know if that is a good sign or a bad one. I am on the verge of calling all the folks I am contracted with and pulling out for fear of what the biopsy and lab work could produce which will, of course add one more stresser...But I want to be honorable with them.

I would suggest that there is a good possibility your weight loss could be due to anxiety as the pounds do fall off with anxiety as your metabolism accelerates dramatically. Worrying is a natural reaction but try and get things onto a even keel and not let your thoughts control you. Easier said than done I admit, but having been through cancer once before, it tends to educate one that worrying over something we have zero control over is counter productive. What I can't control I leave it to the experts. But again what do I know as I'm not a medical doctor but possibly talk to him /her on prescribing some medication to help with the anxiety. Possibly a call into your doc may provide you with a reliable answer and some solution to your anxiety. When is your biopsy date ?. Take care and good luck with the biopsy. Barry",

      "Content": "Thanks to all of you for the comments to this. This is new for me. I am usually concerned for someone else's health, not my own. The biopsy date is the 13th of May. Age 60, have always been very active but mostly in the woodworking trade, hiking, shooting et al. I don't believe I was ever screened specifically for PSA before. This LNP decided to have it done almost on impulse although along with a couple of minor stomach issues, I also mentioned I had a feeling in the end of my Urethra that was odd. Long story short, I don't have anything to match this against although I have already learned 11.1 is high. The Urologist found a hardness/firm spot on the right side which prompted him to set up the biopsy. Of course now, every single twinge/back spasm/\"pain\" immediately puts me into orbit - mentally. I am on Cipro right now because I had determined that at the very least (before the Urologist), I had a UTI. Since I have started taking that, most of the accompanying original symptoms have gone to zero or near zero. I don't know if that is a good sign or a bad one. I am on the verge of calling all the folks I am contracted with and pulling out for fear of what the biopsy and lab work could produce which will, of course add one more stresser...But I want to be honorable with them. Originally Posted by Baz10 John, Sorry your having these issues. I'm on the CRC forum, yet in the same situation as yourself with my template biopsy being done on the 6th May after elevated PSA of 7.20. Also same as yourself had no symptoms and no weight loss. I would suggest that there is a good possibility your weight loss could be due to anxiety as the pounds do fall off with anxiety as your metabolism accelerates dramatically. Worrying is a natural reaction but try and get things onto a even keel and not let your thoughts control you. Easier said than done I admit, but having been through cancer once before, it tends to educate one that worrying over something we have zero control over is counter productive. What I can't control I leave it to the experts. But again what do I know as I'm not a medical doctor but possibly talk to him /her on prescribing some medication to help with the anxiety. Possibly a call into your doc may provide you with a reliable answer and some solution to your anxiety. When is your biopsy date ?. Take care and good luck with the biopsy. Barry",
