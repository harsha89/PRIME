      "Content": "I'm looking for some help for my dad. He's been battling both prostate cancer and colon cancer for 5+ years now. He first had colon cancer, which was removed surgically. Then he had prostate cancer with a pretty high gleason level (I think it was . He had a Radical Prostatectomy to take care of that. Now he's found that the prostate cancer is back with a new tumor in the same area his prostate was in. They confirmed it with MRI and his PSA levels are also up, but not super high (around 1.1 I think). The biggest problems he has right now are random pain (sometimes bearable, sometimes less) that he gets when sitting for extended periods of time, along with bladder control issues that seem to be caused or aggravated by the tumor. My dad is really fed up with many \"traditional\" treatment options, as he has lost so much to surgeries and chemotherapy in the past. I'm really just looking for some advice on other treatment options others may know about that we may be overlooking. His oncologist isn't giving him many options aside from Hormone Therapy (he doesn't want to do this) and maybe radiation (he doesn't want to do those for fear of losing what little bladder control he has left). To make matters worse, his colon cancer has also re-appeared in his lungs. Right now this isn't the pressing issue, though, as it doesn't seem to be causing him any problems yet and seems to be slower-growing than the prostate cancer. Right now he is set on going to Dr. Forsythe's clinic in Reno, likely for PolyMVA. I don't believe this treatment will work, but I don't have any better suggestions for him at the moment. Any help would be appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the reply. My dad is in his mid 50's right now and in good health, other than the cancer and surgery/treatment side-effects. His post-op on his prostate cancer was a very small PSA value (I think in the 0.01 kind of range - basically \"undetectable\"), however, it was non-zero. I don't believe his PSA was checked before surgery, as they found the tumors on his prostate while checking for re-occurrence of his colon cancer. I'm unsure as to exactly what the gleason score was, but I believe it was 8 or 9. They had to remove a great deal of his nerves during his prostatectomy and the surgeon indicated that it looked like it was progressing into his pelvic bone, but they were unsure if it penetrated the bone or not. They indicated they \"scraped\" off everything they could find, though. I think I could convince him to travel somewhat for treatment and/or another opinion, but I think I'd have to provide a reasonable argument/reason for him to do this. This is precisely why I'm here - to find out if there's a compelling reason to go to these places other than just hope. He's stuck on all this alternative treatment as the answer, and I'm being as supportive as possible, but I want to see if there's any non-\"alternative\" options that I could sell him on at least looking into further. I don't want to watch him spend his life savings on \"alternative\" treatments that often have little to no science to back them up. I think the Mayo Clinic in MN might be an option, as that's about a 4 to 4.5 hour drive for him. He may also be open to one of the cancer treatment centers of america, as there is one in Chicago that isn't too far for him as well.",
