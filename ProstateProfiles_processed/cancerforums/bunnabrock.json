      "Content": "My husband was JUST diagnosed at the age of 47 with metastatic prostate cancer (to his bones). He found out after an MRI for back pain. He is in amazing shape, eats well, and never misses a day at the gym (until his back hurt too much--but now, he's going back). There was a large tumor on his L1 that they thought was myeloma for a couple of weeks. He has other tumors, but no pain associated with them. His PSA was 93. To make a LOOOOOONG story short, we went to MD Anderson after hitting a lot of walls in San Diego. They were amazing. We were there for 2 weeks. My husbands PSA there was 191 (after only a few weeks from the 93 initial count). The gleason thing is confusing to us. His tumor in his back was a 10, but the ones in his prostate (which looked remarkably healthy they said) were 7 and 8. Anyway, we have appointments with our California doctor next week (MD Anderson is still our primary and we go back at the end of March) and are wondering what to expect? My hubby is on degarilex (initial double injection) and Zometa. What is a \"good\" low level of testosterone? We have NO idea what to look for. Also, what kind of PSA difference can we expect? I know everyone is different, but what are some of your numbers (metastatic) after your first treatment? His back pain is soon much better. It hardly hurts at all currently. Thanks so much!!! This is incredibly overwhelming to us!",
