      "Content": "Hi all. First time poster and I'm looking for info from folks who've had perineal biopsy's. I'm currently doing active surveillance and was diagnosed in 2008 when my PSA left the 1-2 range and made the huge leap to 3.5. This was enough for the doc to advise a 12 core biopsy. Have since had 3 - 12 core and 1 MRI of the prostate along with multiple PSA's and 3xPCA3's. Results: 1st biopsy 3% in one core only, 2nd biopsy 10% of one 12mm core, 3rd biopsy negative followed by the MRI which was negative. Last 3 PSA's were 3, 4.24, 3.59. PCA3's 34, 55, 99, in that order. My issue now is do I go for a 48 core perineal biopsy to try and better locate the cancer and if so, what side effects have others experienced. Since I have an enlarged prostate and already medicate to ease urination, I expect I'll need a catheter if there's any post swelling. There you have it. Any info on your experience will be gratefully received. Thanks, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter Persuader, Welcome. Looks like you are a perfect candidate for AS. Your age, biopsy, G6 and PSA all indicated your cancer is indolent. In my layperson's opinion, a saturation biopsy is an overkill and you don't need the complications that comes with it. Best wishes and good luck. Thanks for the reply. Not sure my doc (surgeon) agrees with you. LOL However AS is the path I've chosen. The issue though is \"how extensive is the Ca\"? It's my understanding the normal 12 core biopsy can only sample a very small portion of the prostate and pretty much ignores the side it can't reach (I'll call it the underside). Because of the last biopsy and then MRI showing negative, doc is recommending perineal to determine the extent by sampling a greater portion of the prostate. His thinking is the prostate could have extensive CA on the underside and we'd never know it. Wish there was another way, but I haven't heard of it. Thus the reason for reaching out to others who've experienced this type of biopsy.",
