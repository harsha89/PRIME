My PSA went from a 1.5 to 3.5 in just a couple of visits and my free PSA level was 11. They did a prostate biopsy and I got the results back today. They want to repeat the biopsy in 6 weeks because 4 out of the 12 samples came back atypical. What does that mean and what should I expect?",

I have an appointment 7-1-15 with a urologist with the Winship Cancer Group at St Joseph in Atlanta. I have had all my records and results sent to them to look over. I hope to go the AS route at this time. Since this is all new to me what can I expect on my first visit? Will they just take the other doctor's word and results for it or will they do their own examinations and battery of tests? Thanks ya'll have been so helpful!!",

I have an appointment with Dr Peter Rossi at Emory next Thursday 03-17-16 to discuss it. For those of you that have had HDR Brachy and or have heavily researched it I have a question. I know this is a pretty straight forward question but here goes. Can you still ejaculate after HDR therapy? I know with surgery there is still orgasm's but they are dry. I have heard there is still a possibility that you still can after HDR. Is this true? I know that to some this is a vain reason but that is one thing that has me leaning toward HDR since it and surgery have close to equal cure rates. That may not mean much to some but at 49 without that I feel like I am being put out to pasture.",
