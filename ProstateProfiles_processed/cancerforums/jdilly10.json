While the medical field suspects that some diet considerations \"MAY\" help PREVENT cancer, there is no dietary consumable I have ever heard of that can actually cure any type of cancer once it has hit. You say that \"they\" said the lemon juice is 10k times more effective than chemo. Can you tell us who \"they\" are? I would tend to think that it was the radioactive seeding that has been so successful and not what you have been taking. In any case, it certainly does not hurt to take it -- as long as it is not replacing the traditional treatment. In any case, we are all very happy that you are doing much better -- regardless of what is responsible. Good luck!
