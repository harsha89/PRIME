      "Content": "Greetings \u0096 Hello and my name is Joe from Florida. I am 56 years old with a PSA reading of 10.5 and a family history of prostate cancer. The DRE was negative, PSA reading has been rising for the past few years and my first biopsy two years ago was negative. This Friday I received another 12 core biopsy and after the test, I asked my urologist his opinion if I had any prostate cancer. The urologist believed it \u0093may\u0094 be negative as my prostate was large at 95 grams and he provided no guidance and told me to wait for the results. I\u0092d sincerely appreciate any guidance anyone here may provide with the probability of prostate cancer based upon the information provided. Thanks Joe Florida",

Before my appointment, I received a phone call from the urologist\u2019s office indicating that my biopsy results were delayed pending further investigation by the pathologist. Obviously, I am obviously somewhat concerned. Has this ever happened to anyone and does a urologist normally make a phone call to the patient if the biopsy results are positive ? Thanks Joe",

Both advised that they were concerned regarding the PSA reading and the velocity of the PSA readings. Both also advised that my prescribed medications and my weight should in fact lower my PSA (Zetia & Exforge & Aspirin) and both extrapolated an \"approximate\" true PSA reading approaching 11, even taking into account the size of the prostate.
