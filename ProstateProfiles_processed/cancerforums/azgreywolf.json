I haven't been satisfied with the vacuum pump (despite 3 tight rings I deflate upon entry) or with Trimix (just not enough size or hardness). I have stepped up the Trimix to .32 and am not certain its safe to go much higher. Any thoughts on that are welcome. I don't want to go on the rest of my life being sexually frustrated, (not to mention my girlfriend's desires), and so I am seriously considering the penile prosthesis as a last resort. I would greatly appreciate any feedback from men knowledgeable in this procedure, and especially those who have undergone it. Is it a viable and reliable solution to this unfortunate situation? Thanks for your feedback guys.",

Trimix only got me a semi, again not adequate for penetration. A vacuum pump with 3 rings got me fully up, but much of the blood pushed back out anyway on insertion and I'd be in but floppy. I've had one orgasm via intercourse in 3.5 years. The implant is my last great hope. If you're only 10 months out and getting a semi, give it some time.

However all is not perfect for me. I have not had one decent intercourse experience in those 3.5 years. I've tried all the non-invasive options, none worked at all. Enough is enough! I'm now scheduled for the AMS 700 GLX implant next Wed. at Mayo Clinic. I'm nervous, not sure what to expect. I've read a couple discouraging testimonials and seen the video, this procedure is pretty gruesome. But if it works it worth it.

      "Content": "Men, I am 3.5 years post-RP, PSA undetectable and I feel blessed to be cured. My heart goes out to men recently diagnosed and those still struggling with this awful disease. However all is not perfect for me. I have not had one decent intercourse experience in those 3.5 years. I've tried all the non-invasive options, none worked at all. Enough is enough! I'm now scheduled for the AMS 700 GLX implant next Wed. at Mayo Clinic. I'm nervous, not sure what to expect. I've read a couple discouraging testimonials and seen the video, this procedure is pretty gruesome. But if it works it worth it. If any man has undergone implant surgery I would grealy appreciate if you would share your experience at the hospital, during the recovery period and thereafter. Online or via private message, whichever you prefer. Thanks... azgreywolf",

      "Content": "Jebstart, I was left with one nerve, badly damaged. 150mg of Viagra gave a little size, but still too droopy to even try to use. Trimix only got me a semi, again not adequate for penetration. A vacuum pump with 3 rings got me fully up, but much of the blood pushed back out anyway on insertion and I'd be in but floppy. I've had one orgasm via intercourse in 3.5 years. The implant is my last great hope. If you're only 10 months out and getting a semi, give it some time. I've heard surgeons won't do an implant till 24 months post-op at the earliest.",
