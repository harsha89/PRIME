He had 1 year of active surveillance - 2nd biopsy this spring (2015) shows of 13 samples taken 3 were Gleason of 3 +3 =6 and 1 is 3+4 = 7. Bone scan - good, no lymphovascular invasion and no extraprostatic extension BUT has Perineural invasion identified. Now he will be going for prostatectomy in October or November and then radiation following. I'm guessing this Perineural invasion is not a good thing.

I think he may have misunderstood the dr. regarding radiation as one would when they hear the big C word and everything got muffled and I will accompany him to all dr appointments now with pen and paper in hand . I so much appreciate everyones feedback and I will certainly look for that book. Thank you",

What number should we start worrying about if it gets higher. I could ask Dr. these questions but that's not for a week - Thank you - Jeri from Vancouver (ps - still lots of uncontrollable bladder - he's very frustrated about that - especially now thats hes going back to work Feb 9)",
