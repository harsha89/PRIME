      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic A TURP has a very short recovery time and will ensure relief for your dad from all or most of his urinary symptoms. It will mean less to worry about and trouble him as he undergoes HT and RT. I'm trying to remember mine, about 5 years ago. I think I full recovery took no more than a week or so. It could also have the advantage that by reducing the size of his prostate, it will make a smaller target for the RT. The only thing a TURP does is scoop out some prostate tissue through the urethra. For example my prostate size was reduced from about 90 to 30 cc. The urinary sphincters are untouched. The pressue on the urethra from the extra growth is relieved. My uro/surgeon took photos that document my urethra was nearly totally occluded and I was soon headed for total urinary retention (from a normal oval cross section, my urethra looked like a triangle with its side collapsed inward). After my TURP I was able to put out small forest fires. While there are other procedures for BPH, TURP has been considered the gold standard in terms of results. How soon after the TURP can HT start?",
