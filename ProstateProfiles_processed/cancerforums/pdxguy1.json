      "Content": "I was just diagnosed with PCa last week. 1 out of 12 positive Gleason=6 10% of the tissue involved. 1 suspicious for PCa and another 1 PIN. My PSA going into the test was 7.5 (down from a 100+ 5 months ago taken in the midst of a terrible prostatitis flare-up). Most of the higher PSA appears to be generated by a 100cc prostate. I meet the criteria for AS except for my relative \"youth\" of age 56. And my uro supports AS. He also prescribed Finasteride to get the size of my prostate down. After being on AS for a week and researching nutrition and exercise regime, I'm getting more unfomfortable with it. I read cases of some whose biopsy underestimated the cancer. I'm set to see my uro and another PSA reading again in January. Might arrange for a color doppler at that. I can wait until January and just start a nutrition program now because frankly, I can do without seeing any more white coats for 90 days. What I'm thinking about doing is planning on staying on AS for approximately a year (unless quarterly PSA's go up or a positive DRE). In the next quarter, I'll get my weight down to close to normal and follow prostate-friendly nutrition and exercise regimines. I'll have a second biopsy a little less than a year from now. If it shows the slightest adverse change, I'll move toward brachytherapy--hopefully the Finasteride will have reduced my prostate's size enough for that. If not, hormones to get the size down and do brachy at the end of next year. I might even do Rudy Guiliani's \"Triple Play\": brachy, hormones, and radiation for good measure. It worked for him since got NY through 911 and ran for President. He was diagnosed about 14 years ago. I'd love to hear any comments about this plan. Specifically: 1. Am I giving up on AS too soon? 2. What kind of nutrition suggestions might you have because it is not unheard for them to not show cancer on a second biopsy after cleaining up your act with better diet and excercise. It doesn't mean it's not there but it probably means it's not advancing.
