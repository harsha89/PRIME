But lately it's increased a little more and penetrating my jockey shorts wetting my pants. For the main part I hold my urine. So I want to know what options there are? Is there a small pad just for that that sticks on the jockies? The ones I see on the web seem very large. Also, I'm getting up more often to piss. I'm 73. Any suggestions for that?
