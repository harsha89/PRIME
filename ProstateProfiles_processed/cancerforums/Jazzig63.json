I have had gallbladder surgery, back surgery, umbilical hernia surgery., pacemaker......also taking Dilaudid for pain...not many good days, have been suicidal. My father died with colon cancer and my brother died with liver cancer. I have 2 brothers and 3 sisters living. I am the 5th child of 7. I was taking testosterone shots and developed cancer.

      "Content": "I was told the cancer was inoperable, so I took 44 radiation treatments and had Lupron injections every 4 months for 2 years. Had PSA tested last week. Got results today and they were great. I was told in the beginning that I would probably die in 3-5 years. I was diagnosed with a very aggressive prostate cancer that had already spread outside the prostate. I assume I will be tested again in 6 months.
