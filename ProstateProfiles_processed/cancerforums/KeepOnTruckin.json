      "Content": "Guys, First thanks for the welcome and well wishes. I did acquire and read Dr. Walsh's book from cover to cover a month ago. I had seen many posts saying it was a good source of info. After speaking to the PA, surgeon and radiologist at MDACC I was already leaning toward surgery versus radiation. AS never was a consideration for me. After reading Walsh's book it confirmed my decision and I have no reservation at this time. Emotionally and psychologically I believe I'm in a good place. I would add physically as well but I have cancer now so it does not seem appropriate for the time being. I'm a spiritual person, I have a strong belief in God and I think I deal with stress pretty well. I haven't lost a bit of sleep since I found out I have PCa. I think about it constantly though. I have continued my routines as normal and have gradually shared my situation with folks at work. I tried to mentally prepare myself for the biopsy results but I must say when I got the phone message at work to call my doc about the results my heart started pounding. I said a prayer and gave her a call and when she informed me that it was a positive biopsy I felt like I took a punch to the gut and the rest of the day was a bit surreal. I left work at the end of the day and told my wife and got a great night's sleep. I'm looking forward to the surgery. I think I have a good team working in my best interest at MDACC. The surgeon is younger than me and a lot better looking. He has personally performed around 500 RALP surgeries and assisted in about that many prior to taking the controls. He said there will be two assistants, one on each side of me as well as the anesthesiologist during the surgery. I have prior experience with MDACC. My first wife had renal cell carcinoma and most of her care was at MDACC. She died in 2005 at the age of 45. Whatever happens to me I feel very fortunate to have had such great health to this point and will be ok with whatever happens in the future. I'm the first that I know of in my bloodline to have any cancer. My grandfather lived to 96 and my dad is 80 and in great health so I have always planned to live to at least 90 and I still plan to do that today. Since this is Good Friday it makes me appreciate all that I have. I wish you all a happy and blessed Easter.",

I would add physically as well but I have cancer now so it does not seem appropriate for the time being. I'm a spiritual person, I have a strong belief in God and I think I deal with stress pretty well. I haven't lost a bit of sleep since I found out I have PCa. I think about it constantly though. I have continued my routines as normal and have gradually shared my situation with folks at work. I tried to mentally prepare myself for the biopsy results but I must say when I got the phone message at work to call my doc about the results my heart started pounding. I said a prayer and gave her a call and when she informed me that it was a positive biopsy I felt like I took a punch to the gut and the rest of the day was a bit surreal. I left work at the end of the day and told my wife and got a great night's sleep. I'm looking forward to the surgery. I think I have a good team working in my best interest at MDACC. The surgeon is younger than me and a lot better looking. He has personally performed around 500 RALP surgeries and assisted in about that many prior to taking the controls. He said there will be two assistants, one on each side of me as well as the anesthesiologist during the surgery. I have prior experience with MDACC. My first wife had renal cell carcinoma and most of her care was at MDACC. She died in 2005 at the age of 45. Whatever happens to me I feel very fortunate to have had such great health to this point and will be ok with whatever happens in the future. I'm the first that I know of in my bloodline to have any cancer. My grandfather lived to 96 and my dad is 80 and in great health so I have always planned to live to at least 90 and I still plan to do that today.

I had blood in my urine for about 48 hours then it was clear until about 10 days later I peed out a couple of what I think were small blood clots. It took about 6 weeks for my semen to look normal. The waiting is the toughest part. Hang in there! KOT",

      "Content": "Hello function2, I'm just over 4 weeks post surgery. I had one rough day with constipation 7 days after surgery. I had been taking prescribed Doc-Q-Lace 100mg twice daily from the time I had surgery and still had a hell of a time with that first poop. Make sure to have some suppositories on hand just in case. That saved me in the end. I have been dry from day one since my catheter came out while I am awake. I did not leak at all the first night but leaked bad the 2nd night while sleeping. I've only leaked a small spot on a few occasions while sleeping but not in the last week or so. I still wear the diaper at night until I can trust my new plumbing. I wear the Depend Fit Flex. They work well and can hold a lot if you leak. I wore the Depends pads in my underwear the first few days but never needed them and have not used any pads for a couple of weeks now that I trust myself not to leak when awake. I still do my Kegals regularly. I never had any gas pain but my upper abs were sore for a while. I slept in my recliner the 1st 2 weeks because I couldn't lay flat due to the sore abs. The whole surgery experience was not bad at all. The worst was the constipation and I got a stomach bug or something about 2 weeks after the surgery and I could not keep anything down for 3 days. It's no fun to puke your guts up when your innards are already sore and in distress. I started my weight lifting again this week. I'm basically going through the motions with either no weights or just 10 lbs dumb bells making sure I go slow and easy. I also am back at work so I'm getting back to normal.....er the new normal anyway. Good luck to you in your recovery. I'm sure you are going to do great.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by zencat Hello everyone. As you can see from my signature (if I did it correctly and saved it!) that I was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. I am now in that surreal place between diagnosis and RALP surgery, each day trying to function normally while feeling a strange cognitive dissonance in this new world. I know that none of us can ever really know how we will react until we hear those words, but I was not prepared for the profound psychological impact my cancer diagnosis would have on me. I would really like to hear from other men about how they cope with the sheer weight of the word. How do you stay positive? How do you maintain that \"brave face\" in front of your wife when you're fighting back tears, knowing that you have to stay strong for her? I don't want my fear (and it is significant, of course) to seep into her psyche. I know she has plenty of her own fear without seeing me so emotionally sensitive. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. zencat, I know how you feel. I was in your shoes in February of this year. It was definitely a gut punch. Based on my gradually rising PSA I suspected I may have cancer but getting the confirmation call from the doctor made my head spin for a bit. I know what cancer can do to a family. I lost my wife to renal cell in 2005 so all kinds of things started going through my mind. I started thinking less about when I would retire and what I would do for all the years after retirement and started thinking about what I would do in the few years I had left to live. I'm an engineer so my engineer brain finally kicked in and I started researching, looking at potential treatment options and started to approach my situation as a project. The more I learned and read the better I felt. I tried to think positive and stay in reality and not float off into doom and gloom scenarios. After talking to a surgeon and oncologist at MD Anderson they confirmed what I already knew I wanted to do - RALP. Both said either treatment option would be a good in my case and the stats were about the same. I figured I am fairly young, active and in good health....other than the fact I have cancer! Once I made the decision and an appointment for surgery it felt like a huge weight had been lifted and my stress subsided. I started kegals and couldn't wait for surgery day. Surgery was not bad and I healed up quickly and was back at work in about 3 weeks. 6 weeks out I felt 100%. Now it seems like it was a long time ago. It will likely be the same for you. Now is the hard part for you. Hang in there. Bye the way I talked to my wife about everything. I didn't cry but I know she could see the concern in my face and hear it in my words. You can't beat having a good partner in all of this. She may be a lot stronger than you think so let her help you through this. It'll make her feel like she is helping you which is probably what she really wants to do anyway instead of feeling helpless.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by zencat Hello everyone. As you can see from my signature (if I did it correctly and saved it!) that I was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. I am now in that surreal place between diagnosis and RALP surgery, each day trying to function normally while feeling a strange cognitive dissonance in this new world. I know that none of us can ever really know how we will react until we hear those words, but I was not prepared for the profound psychological impact my cancer diagnosis would have on me. I would really like to hear from other men about how they cope with the sheer weight of the word. How do you stay positive? How do you maintain that \"brave face\" in front of your wife when you're fighting back tears, knowing that you have to stay strong for her? I don't want my fear (and it is significant, of course) to seep into her psyche. I know she has plenty of her own fear without seeing me so emotionally sensitive. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. zencat, I know how you feel. I was in your shoes in February of this year. It was definitely a gut punch. Based on my gradually rising PSA I suspected I may have cancer but getting the confirmation call from the doctor made my head spin for a bit. I know what cancer can do to a family. I lost my wife to renal cell in 2005 so all kinds of things started going through my mind. I started thinking less about when I would retire and what I would do for all the years after retirement and started thinking about what I would do in the few years I had left to live. I'm an engineer so my engineer brain finally kicked in and I started researching, looking at potential treatment options and started to approach my situation as a project.

      "Content": "Hi All, I had my 6 week check-up yesterday. My surgeon went over my pathology report in detail. I added it to my signature below. My PSA yesterday was <0.1. I have recovered well from surgery and have been back at work for just over 2 weeks. The whole surgery experience was good with no complications. I have had no incontinence since the 2nd day the catheter was removed. I wore pads for the first week just in case but was always dry. I do have ED but am working on that. I have been working out for 2 weeks now and my energy level is probably 100%. Since I got my report and PSA yesterday I have been thinking a lot about how fortunate and blessed I am. I have never taken my health for granted after having had my wife die of renal cell carcinoma 11 years ago. At that time I re-prioritized a lot of things in my life but time tends to let us slip back into old habits. My PCa has helped me re-focus once again. I want to thank all of you for your support and advice. You really have been a comfort and you helped influence my treatment decision. I will still be checking in daily and monitoring your circumstances. I will continue to pray for all of you as well.",

      "Content": "Hi Bernard1, I had RALP in April 2016 so I'm a bit ahead of you. I had my 2nd undetectable PSA last month so I'm so thankful. I had basically zero incontinence since the catheter was pulled so I'm so thankful for that. I still have ED and I have been on 20 mg Cialis since surgery. I think it's getting a little better. When I was in for my PSA test last month I requested a visit with an ED specialist. I have an appointment in March. I have been using the VED and that seems to be helping with my rehab. My wife puts no pressure on me at all...as matter of fact she seemed to be losing some interest the last couple of years anyway due to her \"change\" but we still had fun at least a couple of times a month. I miss that. If my ED never gets any better I will be perfectly content with it because I know that there are so many poor guys that are struggling with incontinence and cancer and those are much worse in my mind. I'm still optimistic that the ED will improve. Right now I would say I get about 80% on the erection scale of where I was prior to surgery. Some days it get better than that but it's rare. I notice if I use the VED I tend to get better nocturnal erections while sleeping. Hang in there and give it time and remember how blessed you are to be continent and cancer free!",

      "Content": "I had surgery one year ago today. I have been thinking about that a lot these past few days. In the months prior to surgery I was overwhelmed with the what ifs. What treatment option should I choose? What if I choose the wrong one? What is my fall back plan? What if it spread already? How bad will the side effects be? Should I just let it run it's course and do nothing for now? At this time I feel like I made the perfect choice. Obviously I don't know the future but for now I'm in a good place. My stress level has certainly diminished as time has passed since the surgery. The surgery and recovery wasn't bad. I've had no incontinence at all. ED is continuing to get better slowly. I've started to think long term again versus short term regarding retirement and goals. I feel very blessed and very fortunate. I'm blessed to have a great medical facility, gifted surgeon and truly concerned medical staff treating me. Blessed to be treated in a day and age with such advanced medical equipment and procedures and drugs available. I have no regrets and would do it all over exactly the same if I had to do it over again. Fortunately I don't have a prostate so I won't have to do it again!",

      "Content": "I had surgery one year ago today. I have been thinking about that a lot these past few days. In the months prior to surgery I was overwhelmed with the what ifs. What treatment option should I choose? What if I choose the wrong one? What is my fall back plan? What if it spread already? How bad will the side effects be? Should I just let it run it's course and do nothing for now? At this time I feel like I made the perfect choice. Obviously I don't know the future but for now I'm in a good place. My stress level has certainly diminished as time has passed since the surgery. The surgery and recovery wasn't bad. I've had no incontinence at all. ED is continuing to get better slowly. I've started to think long term again versus short term regarding retirement and goals. I feel very blessed and very fortunate. I'm blessed to have a great medical facility, gifted surgeon and truly concerned medical staff treating me. Blessed to be treated in a day and age with such advanced medical equipment and procedures and drugs available. I have no regrets and would do it all over exactly the same if I had to do it over again. Fortunately I don't have a prostate so I won't have to do it again!",

      "Content": "SeaCock, I was switched from 20 mg Cialis to 20 mg Sildenafil a few weeks ago. The Sildenafil works noticeably better than the Cialis for me. Even 20 mgs makes me pretty firm. I was told 3 -5 20 mgs for sex but I have only tried 3 so far and that gets me about 85% there. I used to get very mild sinus headaches the next morning after the Cialis but not bad at all. I have no side effects from the Cialis except better erections. organic farmer, Looking at your sig it looks like you got surgery none too soon! You're posting consistent numbers. Thanks for the advice. I'll take my time with the dosage increase of Trimix. Michigan Man, Yes I feel very fortunate and blessed. I'm not anywhere near where I was pre-surgery but I thank God that I may be cured of cancer. Hang in there. I had my surgery one year ago today. Improvement in erections has been very slow but I went from basically nothing resembling an erection to getting close to maybe 85%. I use the VED several times a week and have been taking the pills since surgery. My doc this week said \"Do not stop using the VED until I get hard as I did at 18, I get tired of having erections, or I just don't give a **** any more\".",

      "Content": "I went to one of my Urologists for a Doppler ultrasound of my penis. I was a bit nervous because I read the procedural hand-out that he gave me a few weeks ago when I scheduled the appointment. It said I would get a Trimix injection just prior to part 2 of the Doppler. I had also read many posts discussing the pain and misadventures and trips to the ER. I was called in to the exam room. The nurse had me drop my drawers to my knees. I was happy that I didn't have to change into a flimsy gown. He had me lay back on the table. He ran the transducer over my little Willy. I was thinking he was thinking how little it was but he didn't say anything! I definitely had stage fright. He clicked 2 spots on the overhead screen pointing out the veins. They looked like tiny white dots. He then drew the Trimix into a small syringe that had a tiny needle. He then proceeded to stick it into the side of my little Willy. He then said he would leave for ten minutes and would return to run the Doppler over my little Willy again. He said to think sensual thoughts until he returned. Within about 5 minutes I was starting to grow. When he came back after ten minutes I had the best erection since surgery 12 months ago. He ran the Doppler over Mr. Willy and the little white dots were now large red spots on the screen. You could see them pulse with my heart beat. He had me pull up my pants and head to the consultation room. He came in and said everything looked great. Nothing abnormal, no cysts or tumors and the blood flow was good. He asked if I could inject myself and I said yes. He gave me a prescription with 11 refills. He injected 10 units and said to try 12 when I did it. He also had me watch a video showing how to prep, inject, where to inject, etc. It didn't hurt at all when he injected me. There was a tiny little prick but was nothing like I had imagined in my mind. There was no burning or stinging either. Two seconds after he remove the needle I felt no pain or anything unusual. The erection felt wonderful.....it had been a while! It lasted about 90 minutes then started to deflate. I had reservations about going to the appointment but now I'm glad I did. Can't wait to get my prescription and give it test run.",

      "Content": "Hello Dave, I just found out last month that I had PCa. I've had all of my visits at MDACC since the beginning including my annual PSA screenings in years prior. I'm sorry to hear about your biopsy experience. I was concerned about infection but mine was uneventful but it did not feel very good at the time. Everything felt normal after about 2 days though. I had my initial visit after the biopsy with a surgeon. He explained options including radiation therapies. I said I wanted to speak to radiology before I decided which route to take. He made a call and the radiology specialist came over in about 15 minutes and gave me the low down on radiation options and proton therapy. Neither doctor really tried to sell me on their specialty and both said surgery and radiation had about the same outcomes. They said the main difference in my case would be that the effects of RALP are immediate and effects of radiation can start to show up months and years down the road. After a few weeks of thought and research I decided on surgery so that I could hopefully deal with it now while I'm younger and get it in the rear view mirror sooner rather than later. I am going to have nerve sparing RALP at MDACC next month. Personally I like the idea that MDACC has everything in house. I had my MRI there a couple of weeks ago as well. So far they have treated me with much compassion and they don't make me feel like I'm in an assembly line or I'm taking up their time. I had a previous experience at MDACC with my wife about 10 years ago when she was dealing with kidney cancer. Several of her doctors are still in the genitourinary clinic. I obviously will have much more data in a couple of months but so far MDACC has been a good choice for me. Hang in there!",

So far they have treated me with much compassion and they don't make me feel like I'm in an assembly line or I'm taking up their time. I had a previous experience at MDACC with my wife about 10 years ago when she was dealing with kidney cancer. Several of her doctors are still in the genitourinary clinic. I obviously will have much more data in a couple of months but so far MDACC has been a good choice for me. Hang in there!",
