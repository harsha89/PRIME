      "Content": "I just wanted to drop by with an update - you guys were very informative and it helped me ask a lot of the right questions. My husband has started hormone therapy bicalutamide, then the Lupron shot - that helped bring down the lymphedema and swelling so he was immediately more comfortable. He also started Chemotherapy - the taxotere. In the end we will not be doing a prostate biopsy - so there will be no gleason score. The biopsy of the lymph node was specifically a prostate cancer - so putting him through the prostate biopsy wouldn't change the treatment plan. He is metastatic stage IV, and it is in his lymph nodes (throughout the body at initial post, but we are not sure now although I can feel that the main masses are no longer present physically). We are currently hoping that this can be managed for some time - but my question now is more about experiences living with Prostate cancer - nearly everyone I see with similar stories is 75+ years of age. I would like to put him in touch with someone who has had a similar experience. I can tell the hormone therapy is hard on him - not to mention the chemo. As for the PSA - we will get the next result prior to next chemo - so currently we have symptom abatement as the proof of concept that this is working - but I am nervous about the PSA test.

      "Content": "I am still very much in the learning stage here - but hoping you guys can give me some good pointers. My husband is 46 YO, in November he noticed strange swelling in his genitals - so we went to see his PCP, who referred to ultrasound and then later to a surgeon for hernia repair. We waited a month and saw the surgeon who informed us that this wasn't a hernia. We saw urology the next day, long story short - CT scan and PSA test follow - PSA 6800 ng/ml - Radiologist who read CT scan said Lymphoma was the primary cancer - all said PSA red herring. We finally get to biopsy lymph node, and it turns out it is a prostate cancer. We meet with the doctors tomorrow to find out more including probably Gleason score and treatment options but I am confounded - how did he get to stage IV with no other symptoms? (it has apparently involved all his lymph nodes) Clearly there will be treatment plan - but less clear is what that looks like. Hubby is still working full time, fairly physical job, unloads retail truck, stocks shelves on feet all day etc. I am so torn because I feel like specifically the treatment will be worse than the disease - although this in fundamentally not true - treatment will be his first real physical setback - Any pointers you guys can give me on where to get more info, best treatment outcomes, and any experiences with Kaiser Permanente and Prostate Cancer would be appreciated as well. Thank you!",

      "Content": "Thanks guys - I wish the PSA was a typo - but we ran twice first time - 6812, second 6815. At any rate that was my first understanding of that number as well - aggressive prostate cancer - HOWEVER - the next scan we did was the CT scan - at that point the radiologist instead indicated we were working with Lymphoma - so the biopsy result is actually from the lymph node - All we have from the Dr. so far is that is stage 4 prostate cancer. I expect when we meet with the Dr. tomorrow I will get some information regarding the gleason score - (it is one of the questions on my list) and hopefully some treatment options. The real kicker here is that they thought that because the prostate looked pretty OK on the imaging scan. In terms of Cancer centers - I may look for a 2nd opinion from one, but our insurance does not cover any of the cancer centers. I have not ruled it out yet - but I want to see if I can get the same treatment options from within the system, but I have started to make some contacts along those lines. We are in Colorado - so if you know of a place I could go for a good 2nd opinion - I would appreciate the recommendation. I will post more tomorrow after I get the rest of the information we want from the Dr. but I appreciate the responses - I am doing my best to be optimistic and look at the best case scenarios - but I don't want to pretend the worst doesn't exist -",
