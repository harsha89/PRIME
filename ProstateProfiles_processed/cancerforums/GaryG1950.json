      "Content": "More on this from PR Newswire: HORSHAM, Pa., April 28, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Centocor Ortho Biotech Inc. announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ZYTIGA'' (abiraterone acetate), an oral, once-daily medication for use in combination with prednisone for the treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel. Androgens are hormones that promote the development and maintenance of male sex characteristics. Â However, in prostate cancer, androgens can help fuel the tumor''s growth. Androgen production primarily occurs in the testes and adrenal glands; in men with prostate cancer, the tumor tissue is an additional source of androgens. ZYTIGA is an oral androgen biosynthesis inhibitor that works by inhibiting the CYP17 enzyme complex, which is required for the production of androgens at these three sources. \"This FDA approval represents a welcome new option in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer,\" said Howard Scher, MD, Chief of the Genitourinary Oncology Service, Sidney Kimmel Center for Urologic and Prostate Cancers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and one of the co-lead investigators for the Phase 3 clinical study. \"As a clinician, I believe the efficacy and safety profile of abiraterone acetate, as well as its oral, once-daily formulation, will help address the important need for additional therapeutic choices for men living with this serious disease.\"",
