      "Content": "Well, I finished up my HDR Monotherapy treatment last week (4/12) at UCSF under Dr. Hsu and, all in all, it wasn't bad. The actual implant was a piece of cake and the subsequent three treatments (fractions) all went without a hitch ... none lasting longer than 20 minutes. Each fraction delivered 10.5 Gy to the prostate for a total of 31.5 Gy over the course of the three fractions. The hardest part of the whole process was the not being able to move much while the implant was in place, given my already existant back problems. However, given that the whole thing only lasted a total of 36 hours, I can't complain. A small price to pay in the hopes of ridding myself of this crappy disease. Thus far, the side effects have amounted to some soreness (due to the 36 hour catheder) and some burning during urination (due to both the catheder and the radiation. The latter is supposed to subside in a couple of weeks and the catheder soreness is almost gone as I write this. I returned to work 4 days after the last fraction and, thus far, have experienced only a minimal amount of tiredness. Of course it is still very early in this particular journey so I won't know just how effective the treatment was for some time. For those contemplating HDR monotherapy, I will try to add to this \"blog\" as time goes by.",

      "Content": "Well, I finished up my HDR Monotherapy treatment last week (4/12) at UCSF under Dr. Hsu and, all in all, it wasn't bad. The actual implant was a piece of cake and the subsequent three treatments (fractions) all went without a hitch ... none lasting longer than 20 minutes. Each fraction delivered 10.5 Gy to the prostate for a total of 31.5 Gy over the course of the three fractions. The hardest part of the whole process was the not being able to move much while the implant was in place, given my already existant back problems. However, given that the whole thing only lasted a total of 36 hours, I can't complain. A small price to pay in the hopes of ridding myself of this crappy disease. Thus far, the side effects have amounted to some soreness (due to the 36 hour catheder) and some burning during urination (due to both the catheder and the radiation. The latter is supposed to subside in a couple of weeks and the catheder soreness is almost gone as I write this. I returned to work 4 days after the last fraction and, thus far, have experienced only a minimal amount of tiredness. Of course it is still very early in this particular journey so I won't know just how effective the treatment was for some time. For those contemplating HDR monotherapy, I will try to add to this \"blog\" as time goes by.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed in 12/1/10 with PC, Gleason 3 + 3 = 6, PSA 2.75, T2a, 2 of 12 cores, 10% volume. Being a voracious reader, I, of course, read everything I could read on the subject . both it's characteristics and it's treatment options. Once I got over the \"scared stiff\" part of the ordeal, I started to determine just what treatment was best for me. Active Surviellence (sp?) was out given my personality .... too much of a worry wart. Eventually, I started settling in on HDR Monotherapy either at UCLA with Dr. Demanes or at UCSF under Dr. Hsu. At present I'm scheduled for the treatment in early April. What I would dearly love is some first hand experiences with the treatment, its effectiveness, side effects, and long term results (thus usual - incontinence, ED, etc.). It would be even better if a few of you have been given this treatment under Dr. Hsu.",
