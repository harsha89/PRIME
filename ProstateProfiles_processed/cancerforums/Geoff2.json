He has subsequently booked me in for an MRI plus bone scan,but because I'm going through the public health system it looks like I will have to wait a minimum of six weeks, maybe longer. Naturally I'm worried at the delay despite the literature saying there is no need to panic as this type of cancer is slow growing. My point though is that if the cancer has spread beyond the prostrate then surely there is a need for urgency so that radiation treatment or surgery can commence at the earliest?",
