      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Rob, There can often be very minute traces of PSA remaining after surgery. Many times this is attributable to small amounts of benign prostate tissue left behind. There is always a discussion about standard PSA tests and ultrasensitive tests. For example, Mayo Clinic prefers to NOT use the ultra sensitive because they say it causes too much UNNECESSARY anxiety. I would not be worried about this at all. There are always micro-fluxuations of PSA at the macro level -- things that mean nothing at all. But they are picked up by the ultrasensitive, which is when worries can be triggered even though it is harmless. Good luck! Chuck Thanks Chuck....I agree if I had a regular PSA and not hama would just say <0.1....would not even know....my doctor says anything under 0.5 are meaningless fluctuations...will get another in April...thanks",

      "Content": "Hello - so I am now 5 yrs post prostatectomy (Davinci) and had positive margin...Because I take propecia - used to take proscar for yrs so when I stopped didn't want to lose ALL my hair :+( - I thought maybe I should get the HAMA (more exact?) PSA test as well for the 5 yr test since perhaps propecia could mask a psa increase like the proscar did. So I went off the propecia for a month before my test - I got my total and free PSA back today (YEAH UNDETECTABLE) and should have HAMA next week....so my questions - 1) what should I be looking/hoping for in the HAMA test - what would be \"GOOD\" for me 2) Is there any chance the normal total PSA is undetectable (good) and HAMA could be \"bad\" 3) Can someone explain exactly the difference between the tests - I looked on the \"stickies\" and didn't see this. Thanks a million to the great people on this board.",

      "Content": "Here is the comment on the review of my prostate that was taken out by the DaVinci machine.... \"The tumor which is peripherally located involves the mid and anterior portions of the right lobe and is focally transected at inked margin. The area of transsection appears to represent prostatic parnchyma\" Comment....The area of right apex positive for the tumor appears to represent transsection of prostatic parenchyma as opposed to transsection of tumor extending beyon prostatic capsule... I talked to my doctor (this operation was six yrs ago) about this back in 2009 as it appeared to me that they may have not cut out all the prostate - that the transsection was at the top of the prostate but may have left some in - he went back and looked at the slides and other parts of the prostate at the pathologist and assured me they got it all and that the very tip may have been burned off I think.....Now six yrs later as I said after having normal PSA's when I got the ultrasensitive HAMA PSA my PSA went from <0.02 to .04....in 18 months (as I noted in a previous post should I worry - thanks for your responses) ... so now I asked for pathology report again and wonder if a piece was left in Any help - I did go back to him and we will monitor my ultra sensitive PSA every 3 months...I am in good spirits but do want to understand the above...Would appreciate all of your interpretations and thoughts as I contemplate radiation if my PSA goes to 0.1 - hoping my propecia on and or calibration of the HAMA was off - my free and total PSA is still < 0.1 Thanks this board is a GREAT ASSET Rob Gleason Score 7",

      "Content": "ThANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR REPLY - GOING TO GET A 3 MONTH PSA UPDATE BUT AM TRYING NOT TO WORRY Originally Posted by Michael F Hi again Rob! I'm not qualified help you with your question about prostate parenchyma in your path report. I have an opinion that pathologists have created their own language of \"Pathologese\" in which statements are often vague and ambiguous! If it continues to gnaw on your psyche 6+ years post op, you might be able to have your path report reviewed by an expert like Dr Epstein at Hopkins. Not sure though how beneficial this might be. Regarding your recent PSA measurements, Response # 8 to your post last Sept still stands. http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...677#post291677 0.02 followed by 0.04 does NOT indicate a rise! Did the same lab do both of these PSAs? Looking at your previous posts, it appears that you used Quest. (Which BTW, others have recently reported issues with Quest reporting incorrect results) Have your MD's office call Quest and ask them: \"Specifically for the Post Prostatectomy PSA with HAMA test, What is the Standard Deviation for PSA values that are < 0.10 ng/ml? I can assure you that 0.02 and 0.04 are well within the Std Dev for this assay. If so, this means that statistically, clinically and scientifically your 2 results are the SAME! Also, 0.04 is clinically \"Undetectable\" which means it is \"0\". Keep in mind, BR is defined as 2 or 3 consecutive increases in PSA. However they must be in a clinically \"detectable\" range which is > 0.05 ng/ml. Meanwhile try & chill down and not worry about it. A lot easier said than done! Being > 6 years post RP, BR remains a possibility BUT the likelihood / probability decreases with each passing year. I don't like Ultrasensitive PSAs but think they advisable for those who are in higher risk categories based on surgical and pathological findings at RP. Good luck! Hope you don't have to ask this question again. MF",
