      "Content": "Originally Posted by kevinp About 5 years ago I had RRP. After my surgery my urologist suggested that I use the Pos-T-Vac Therapy System to help with the healing process. Not only will the Pos-T-Vac pull new oxygenated blood to the penis helping the healing, but it also helps so the penis is not shortened by pulling it up into the body and losing some of your length. Almost every time you have a procedure on the prostate ED maybe a side effect. It could be short term but it also could turn out to be long term. I was extremely happy with the results that I achieved with the pump. I would suggest this form of therapy to any man having prostate or Erectile Dysfunction problems. I agree here. A good medical grade pump will work for more men than pills. 90% as opposed to 50%. And a pump costs alot less than pills. No headache or stuffy nose. Also you can be \"up and running' in about 5 mins,. I recommend practicing for a couple weeks before actually having sex. There is a slight learning curve, but there are good directions available on FrankTalk.org. I bought my pump onine for $200, Pumps can run anywhere from $100 to $500+. But think about a few years of prescriptions and how much that can cost.",
