      "Content": "Hi all from Melbourne Australia. My name is Shane, 53 yo, and on October 10th this Year I was diagnosed with Prostrate Cancer. Initially I had no symptoms. I went for my full blood tests to check Cholesterol, sugars etc and decided that I should also get a PSA test. The Monday after the test I got a call from the doctor saying that he needed to see me. It turned out that my PSA was 93.75. Next day I went to a specialist who straight away organised a biopsy. Before that CT scans and a bone scan were organised. Result was that it was stage T3 with a combined Gleason Score of 8. On the bone scan it also showed a spot on the top of my spine near the neck. After consultation with an Oncologist my Urologist decided to start me on Zolacos, which is a Hormone tablet (Cosudex)combined with a 10.8 3 monthly injection (Zoladex) I was wondering if anyone has been on these or is currently on them? So far the side effects haven't been pleasant (nausea, heartburn feeling) but compared with some they say may occur. Thanks for reading this and I hope to learn a lot more about PC from here and hopefully I can contribute also. All the best.",
