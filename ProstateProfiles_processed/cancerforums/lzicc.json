I drink a few cups of coffee a day and don't really drink any alcohol. I don't think drinking either would be bad, but that is my opinion. Drinking allot is just not good for your body though. I was doing kegels 3 times a day and went down to twice a day. Three times a day was too much for me. I would get sore. Also, you are onlyl 4 weeks post. Give it some time. I am 7 weeks post op and still have minor leaking, sometimes when I walk, but mainly when I exert myself. Good luck!!",

      "Content": "He seems to be a really good doctor. I felt very comfortable talking with him today. I am going to follow up with the other euro that he suggested. The soonest my euro can do the operation would be a good 5 weeks out. He told me not to schedule until I get a second opinion. He also said that I have to wait a good 4+ weeks from the biopsy procedure so that the prostate can get back to normal. I do feel allot better today about this. I feel like a weight has been lifted off of me.",

      "Content": "Just getting back from my Euro followup and the CT scan came back clean. Thank goodness for that. I talked to my euro for quite a long time. He feels that removal of my prostate is what he would recommend. He only does open surgery and not the robotic. He doesn't do the robotic but said if I opt for that to make sure I get a doctor that has done allot of them. He has a doctor that he can recommend that all he does is robotic. He also wants me to speak with another euro before I make a decision. My current euro has done a few thousand of the open surgeries. He has been a euro for 30 years. He feels that either way I go that there is no real difference in success rates doing open or robotic, he said that there will be a few more weeks of recovery time doing open. We did briefly discuss radiation implants, but he said at my age, he would do it, he just feels removal would be better for me. He explained things to me very well which I liked.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with prostate cancer a few months ago and it really changed my life. I was very depressed over the whole thing when I first found out, but didn't let it get me down. I'm the one that thinks it will never happen to me. I have no family history of prostate cancer so the news really shocked me when I found out I had it. After talking to my Uro after the fact, like he explained, of what they could see of the biopsy, the cancer was contained in the prostate. So common sense told me, why not take the prostate out and get that cancer out of me. That would also leave radiation follow up after the fact just in case. It was a no brainer for me. The question I did have was to go open or robotic. Since I really liked my Uro and he has only does open, I went with open. I did talk to another Uro that does both but did not feel as comfortable with him. And like they both said, the outcome is pretty much the same. I didn't waste much time and made the appointment to have it removed. I have to say, the hardest part of the surgery was the day before only being able to drink clear fluids. I like to eat. When I got to the hospital and went into my pre-op changing room, they gave me a robe to change into and I shut the door to change. That is when it all hit me. I started to get very depressed. I got on my knees and prayed to God to hold my hand throughout the process. God has always been there for me and I know he always will be. I got changed and let the nurses in so they could prep me. All of the nurses talking to me really helped calm me down. Once they prepped me, they let my wife in so she could be with me prior to the surgery. After about 15 minutes, they came in to get me to take me to surgery. They gave me some drugs to calm my nerves before going into the surgery room. Before I knew it, I was in post op feeling really out of it, but no pain whatsoever. They wheeled me up to my room and my wife was there. She talked to the Uro and he said that the operation went perfect and that all the tissue's looked very healthy. My surgery was at 12:30 pm and I was in my hospital room by about 4 pm. After surgery, my diet was strictly ice shavings, which was ok since I didn't have an appetite after all I have been through. The main thing they want you to do after surgery is to get up and walk around. That night I made myself walk around the hospital. I was going to do whatever they wanted me to. I wasn't in much pain when I walked, but my legs felt a little sluggish, but that went away fairly quick. The next day I walk throughout the day. The hardest part was carrying the catheter bag around along with the IV stand. The next day, my Uro came in to see me to see how I was doing and he was very happy to see me smiling and doing so well. He gave me the green light to eat what I wanted. He was very optimistic about my surgery and told me that he feels that that in December, this will just be blimp in the radar for me. I don't want to get too long winded here, but wanted to hopefully give others some peace of mind. I'm not out of the woods yet, but so far things are looking good. I am the biggest baby when it comes to stuff like this but with the grace of Jesus Christ, I made it to this point and feel confident I will continue to improve as the years go by. I could not have made it this far without him. He is my rock. Thank all of you on this board for your support. You don't how much that has helped me and I will keep updating everyone as things move forward.",

      "Content": "Tomorrow will be 1 week since I had the surgery. A few things I have noticed since getting released on Friday. The soreness has gotten worse. I don't really have pain, just sore. My appetite is slowly starting to come back. I would say I eat about half as many calories now as I did before surgery. Passing gas hurts. I noticed today when I had a bowel movement, I must have pushed a little and saw some urine stream out between the catheter and the penis. My wife is going to stop at my Uro to get a script and will let them know about that. I don't know if that is normal or not. I've been staying in a recliner for the most part. I get up every so often and walk around. I don't really feel like doing anything. When I do try to get out of the recliner, there is some pain in my abdomen. Yesterday, I was getting momentary aches over my body that would last for a second or 2. Last night I was feeling like I was fighting a cold and got up this morning and feel the same way. The swelling at the underneath my scrotum seems to be getting a little better. This was the worst part. It just felt weird, like I was sitting on something. Yesterday was the first day that I did not nap throughout the day. Sleeping at night has been rough. I'll fall asleep for a few hours then get up. I have a hard time getting back to sleep. Last night was the first night I slept throughout the night. I did get up occasionally but was able to fall back asleep. The only pain meds that I have been on since I got released was Tylenol every 6 hours. I really don't want to take anything stronger if I don't have to. I think if I would take a vicodin at night, I may sleep better. I will say now when I have to cough or sneeze, it's a new adventure in pain. This is where I am at right now. I'll keep everyone posted.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with prostate cancer a few months ago and it really changed my life. I was very depressed over the whole thing when I first found out, but didn't let it get me down. I'm the one that thinks it will never happen to me. I have no family history of prostate cancer so the news really shocked me when I found out I had it. After talking to my Uro after the fact, like he explained, of what they could see of the biopsy, the cancer was contained in the prostate. So common sense told me, why not take the prostate out and get that cancer out of me. That would also leave radiation follow up after the fact just in case. It was a no brainer for me. The question I did have was to go open or robotic. Since I really liked my Uro and he has only does open, I went with open. I did talk to another Uro that does both but did not feel as comfortable with him. And like they both said, the outcome is pretty much the same. I didn't waste much time and made the appointment to have it removed. I have to say, the hardest part of the surgery was the day before only being able to drink clear fluids. I like to eat. When I got to the hospital and went into my pre-op changing room, they gave me a robe to change into and I shut the door to change. That is when it all hit me. I started to get very depressed. I got on my knees and prayed to God to hold my hand throughout the process. God has always been there for me and I know he always will be. I got changed and let the nurses in so they could prep me. All of the nurses talking to me really helped calm me down. Once they prepped me, they let my wife in so she could be with me prior to the surgery. After about 15 minutes, they came in to get me to take me to surgery. They gave me some drugs to calm my nerves before going into the surgery room. Before I knew it, I was in post op feeling really out of it, but no pain whatsoever. They wheeled me up to my room and my wife was there. She talked to the Uro and he said that the operation went perfect and that all the tissue's looked very healthy. My surgery was at 12:30 pm and I was in my hospital room by about 4 pm. After surgery, my diet was strictly ice shavings, which was ok since I didn't have an appetite after all I have been through. The main thing they want you to do after surgery is to get up and walk around. That night I made myself walk around the hospital. I was going to do whatever they wanted me to. I wasn't in much pain when I walked, but my legs felt a little sluggish, but that went away fairly quick. The next day I walk throughout the day. The hardest part was carrying the catheter bag around along with the IV stand. The next day, my Uro came in to see me to see how I was doing and he was very happy to see me smiling and doing so well. He gave me the green light to eat what I wanted. He was very optimistic about my surgery and told me that he feels that that in December, this will just be blimp in the radar for me. I don't want to get too long winded here, but wanted to hopefully give others some peace of mind. I'm not out of the woods yet, but so far things are looking good. I am the biggest baby when it comes to stuff like this but with the grace of Jesus Christ, I made it to this point and feel confident I will continue to improve as the years go by. I could not have made it this far without him. He is my rock. Thank all of you on this board for your support. You don't how much that has helped me and I will keep updating everyone as things move forward.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with prostate cancer a few months ago and it really changed my life. I was very depressed over the whole thing when I first found out, but didn't let it get me down. I'm the one that thinks it will never happen to me. I have no family history of prostate cancer so the news really shocked me when I found out I had it. After talking to my Uro after the fact, like he explained, of what they could see of the biopsy, the cancer was contained in the prostate. So common sense told me, why not take the prostate out and get that cancer out of me. That would also leave radiation follow up after the fact just in case. It was a no brainer for me. The question I did have was to go open or robotic. Since I really liked my Uro and he has only does open, I went with open. I did talk to another Uro that does both but did not feel as comfortable with him. And like they both said, the outcome is pretty much the same. I didn't waste much time and made the appointment to have it removed. I have to say, the hardest part of the surgery was the day before only being able to drink clear fluids. I like to eat. When I got to the hospital and went into my pre-op changing room, they gave me a robe to change into and I shut the door to change. That is when it all hit me. I started to get very depressed. I got on my knees and prayed to God to hold my hand throughout the process. God has always been there for me and I know he always will be. I got changed and let the nurses in so they could prep me. All of the nurses talking to me really helped calm me down. Once they prepped me, they let my wife in so she could be with me prior to the surgery. After about 15 minutes, they came in to get me to take me to surgery. They gave me some drugs to calm my nerves before going into the surgery room. Before I knew it, I was in post op feeling really out of it, but no pain whatsoever. They wheeled me up to my room and my wife was there. She talked to the Uro and he said that the operation went perfect and that all the tissue's looked very healthy. My surgery was at 12:30 pm and I was in my hospital room by about 4 pm. After surgery, my diet was strictly ice shavings, which was ok since I didn't have an appetite after all I have been through. The main thing they want you to do after surgery is to get up and walk around. That night I made myself walk around the hospital. I was going to do whatever they wanted me to. I wasn't in much pain when I walked, but my legs felt a little sluggish, but that went away fairly quick. The next day I walk throughout the day. The hardest part was carrying the catheter bag around along with the IV stand. The next day, my Uro came in to see me to see how I was doing and he was very happy to see me smiling and doing so well. He gave me the green light to eat what I wanted. He was very optimistic about my surgery and told me that he feels that that in December, this will just be blimp in the radar for me. I don't want to get too long winded here, but wanted to hopefully give others some peace of mind. I'm not out of the woods yet, but so far things are looking good. I am the biggest baby when it comes to stuff like this but with the grace of Jesus Christ, I made it to this point and feel confident I will continue to improve as the years go by. I could not have made it this far without him. He is my rock. Thank all of you on this board for your support. You don't how much that has helped me and I will keep updating everyone as things move forward.",

      "Content": "Tomorrow will be 1 week since I had the surgery. A few things I have noticed since getting released on Friday. The soreness has gotten worse. I don't really have pain, just sore. My appetite is slowly starting to come back. I would say I eat about half as many calories now as I did before surgery. Passing gas hurts. I noticed today when I had a bowel movement, I must have pushed a little and saw some urine stream out between the catheter and the penis. My wife is going to stop at my Uro to get a script and will let them know about that. I don't know if that is normal or not. I've been staying in a recliner for the most part. I get up every so often and walk around. I don't really feel like doing anything. When I do try to get out of the recliner, there is some pain in my abdomen. Yesterday, I was getting momentary aches over my body that would last for a second or 2. Last night I was feeling like I was fighting a cold and got up this morning and feel the same way. The swelling at the underneath my scrotum seems to be getting a little better. This was the worst part. It just felt weird, like I was sitting on something. Yesterday was the first day that I did not nap throughout the day. Sleeping at night has been rough. I'll fall asleep for a few hours then get up. I have a hard time getting back to sleep. Last night was the first night I slept throughout the night. I did get up occasionally but was able to fall back asleep. The only pain meds that I have been on since I got released was Tylenol every 6 hours. I really don't want to take anything stronger if I don't have to. I think if I would take a vicodin at night, I may sleep better. I will say now when I have to cough or sneeze, it's a new adventure in pain. This is where I am at right now. I'll keep everyone posted.",

When I walk around I dribble and when I stand up or sit down I dribble. I hope things get better soon. I notice when I do urinate in the toilet, once I am down, the bottom of my bladder feels irritated for a few seconds. Could that be from the catheter being in and will go away?

      "Content": "It's been 1 week and 1 day since surgery and I do have my ups and downs. My appetite is almost non existent. I have no real appetite for anything. I used to love bacon and eggs and now I have to force them down. I'm not sleeping through the night. The night before I felt like I as fighting a cold. I fell asleep at 1pm and woke up at 6 am covered in sweat. I stopped taking Tylenol as of yesterday morning and as of now don't feel like I need any pain killers. Last night I slept through the night which made me happy. My back aches, probably from the position I was in for the procedure and sitting around so much. The swelling in my lower regions has gone down quite a bit. I wish I had more energy. I sit in my chair all day and have to force myself to get up and do some walking. Really weird. I felt better the day after surgery than I do now. I'm thinking maybe the anesthesia has allot to do with my issue's?",

      "Content": "My Uro called today. I was sleeping but my wife got the call. The cancer was contained within the prostate!!! When they did the initial biopsy, they only found cancer in the right lobe. The pathologist that looked at the prostate after it was removed said they did find some cancer in the left lobe also. This is great news. My Uro has been awesome through this whole thing. He told me that he would not know anything till next week, but got the report back early and called me today. Anyone looking for a Uro in the Pittsburgh area, let me know. He does open only and has done thousands of them. He did a great job for me.",

It's only a few drops, but it did bother me allot. I spoke more with the nurse about the options of having my ps removed and my doc does the open one not the robotic, but they have another doc that does the robotic. I was surprised to find out that the robotic can take up to 4 hours and the open is about an hour. I would have thought it would be the other way around. I would rather not be put under for longer than needed. I think the longer you are under, the harder it is on your body.",

      "Content": "First of all, I am 49 years old and my family does not have any history of prostate cancer. Over the past few months, I have been getting my PSA levels checked. This started because I was having a burning sensation when urinating. My PSA level's fluctuated between 4.5 and as high as 6. I had a biopsy done and out of the 12 cores, 2 of them were positive for cancer. My Gleason score is 6 and the cores where at 50%. The 2 cores that tested positive came from the right lobe of the prostate. Allot of this is new to me, so I am still learning. I will be having a CT scan done in the next week or so to see if the cancer possibly spread. Of what I heard, since my score is 6 which is considered low risk, it more than likely did not spread yet. I know I am jumping the gun, but what are good options for treatment? If it was up to me, I would rather just have the prostate removed if this will remove the cancer, but I am concerned about possible side effects. If they do remove my prostate, will they also remove my lymph nodes?",

Between this PC news and coming off the test, I don't want to turn into a train wreck. I talked to the nurse at the doctors office to get more info and just to talk and the one thing I thought and she said the same thing, if I have the prostate removed, it removes the cancer and I'm pretty much cancer free. It seems like a no brainer. Am I missing something here? Since all treatment have about the same sides, why not? I don't plan on having anymore kids. How will this effect my sex though?",

This started because I was having a burning sensation when urinating. My PSA level's fluctuated between 4.5 and as high as 6. I had a biopsy done and out of the 12 cores, 2 of them were positive for cancer. My Gleason score is 6 and the cores where at 50%. The 2 cores that tested positive came from the right lobe of the prostate. Allot of this is new to me, so I am still learning. I will be having a CT scan done in the next week or so to see if the cancer possibly spread. Of what I heard, since my score is 6 which is considered low risk, it more than likely did not spread yet. I know I am jumping the gun, but what are good options for treatment? If it was up to me, I would rather just have the prostate removed if this will remove the cancer, but I am concerned about possible side effects. If they do remove my prostate, will they also remove my lymph nodes?",
