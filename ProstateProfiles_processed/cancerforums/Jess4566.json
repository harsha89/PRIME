I know this treatment might not make him cancer free but then again, neither does radial surgery (based on the free psa that is still in your system that wasn't, and can't be, removed.) I don't trust needle biopsies either. It is a blind hope that that the doctor caught all the cancerous tissues. But, with today's current technology and being as advanced as it, I trust MIR's. Will it catch the smallest tumor? Maybe not. But what is the chance that small tumor will amount to anything? I am looking at focal ablation because it is the best option in terms of keeping one's function. It is the middle ground per say. I am hoping, somehow, I can reach out to people outside of the USA where this technology is relatively old. Again, thank you for the words. I will continue updating.",

I know this treatment might not make him cancer free but then again, neither does radial surgery (based on the free psa that is still in your system that wasn't, and can't be, removed.) I don't trust needle biopsies either. It is a blind hope that that the doctor caught all the cancerous tissues. But, with today's current technology and being as advanced as it, I trust MIR's. Will it catch the smallest tumor? Maybe not. But what is the chance that small tumor will amount to anything? I am looking at focal ablation because it is the best option in terms of keeping one's function. It is the middle ground per say.

      "Content": "Hey guys, I was wondering if any of you knowledgeable folks can provide me with some info on the after care of the prostate gland once a biopsy has been done. How long does the gland take to heal fully? Is there anything one can take (food, supplements, exercise?) to help promote the healing of the gland? How long does the gland take to heal? 1 month? 3 months? Has anyone experienced a I guess a tight discomfort or just a general discomfort after having a biopsy? What about intense testicular pain? Or varying levels of pain in the testes? Does anyone know why this would occur? Last queston, how soon can an MRI be done after a biopsy? Right away? Or should it wait after a month(s)? Why do I need to wait? Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you all have a good day.",
