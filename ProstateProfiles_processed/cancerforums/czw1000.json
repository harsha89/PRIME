      "Content": "My father was diagnosed with PC at 64 and died from it at 69. My father's father was also diagnosed with PC, although that diagnosis came in his 70s, and the doctors said it did not seem like an aggressive enough cancer to treat at that age--he died in his late 70s of other causes at. I am 44, about to turn 45. My last visit to a general practitioner for a checkup was February 2017. My PSA at that time was 0.299. That was my first time seeing that G.P., and she did not do a digital rectal exam. We didn't discuss it. Before that G.P., my old doctor (in a different city) did do DREs. I think given my family history, regular DREs are warranted. Obviously I could discuss that with my current G.P. I find that a little awkward because she's a woman, but I could probably get over that. The bigger issue is that if she is not in the habit of regularly performing DREs--and I assume she is not because she didn't suggest doing one with me, despite my having told her my family history--I don't fully trust her to do them well. My understanding is that false positives are a significant issue with DREs. It seems to me one of the few things I can do about that, as someone with an elevated risk in my family history who would like to seek out DREs, is try to find a doctor with significant experience administering them. Relatedly, it would be great if there were a doctor who does annual checkups who has experience with patients with family histories of prostate cancer. I asked my father's hospital (Memorial Sloan Kettering) about this, and they were very clear that their specialists only treat diagnosed people and don't do G.P.-type annual checkups. So I am seeking input or thoughts on: 1) Whether there is merit to seeking out a G.P. who regularly administers DREs and/or has experience with people who have a family history of PC, or whether I am over-thinking this. 2) Recommendations for a such a G.P. in New York City or Westchester County, New York.
