    "Content": "Hello everyone, I am 43 years old and was put on testosterone therapy(injections 200ml biweekly) after a month of use I started having urinary problems. Went to my GP and he did a DRE and found a nodule on the left side of my prostate. My PSA 3 months ago was 1.0. He sent me to a Urologist which has set me up for CT scan tomorrow of my pelvis. He has scheduled me also for biopsy and a cysto on 9/11/17. I've of course have stopped the testosterone immediately! I'm so worried and don't know if my mind is playing tricks on me, but I started having back pain. Any advise or knowledge you can pass my way would be helpful.. Thank you all!!",
