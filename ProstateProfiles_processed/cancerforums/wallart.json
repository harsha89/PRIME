      "Content": "My husband is 61 and has been dealing with prostate cancer symptoms for the last 10 years. While not officially diagnosed with PC because of going the natural route and avoiding western medicine. He has a PSA reading of 143 currently and it has been as high as 200 last year, about 8 years ago it was 32. He currently has a catheter and has had it for about a year now. He does have a tumor there on the prostate that was checked by a urologist and was told it was probably cancer. He is more tired than usual but still works and his appetite is still good, only problems are urinary and he is often achy and sore in the pelvis area and in his shoulders. He eats well and he follows the Dr. Morse fruit diet as much as possible, he is very thin. While I believe both in the natural diet and in western medicine I am very worried about his prognosis and that with such a high PSA number that the cancer has already spread to his bones, etc and it is too late. Am I correct to think this and what can I do to help Him?",

I agree he has to do something now without delay and I thank you for your frank talk. Obviously I am frustrated, worried and feel helpless but will try again. Keep you posted, thanks again.",

      "Content": "My husband is 61 and has been dealing with prostate cancer symptoms for the last 10 years. While not officially diagnosed with PC because of going the natural route and avoiding western medicine. He has a PSA reading of 143 currently and it has been as high as 200 last year, about 8 years ago it was 32. He currently has a catheter and has had it for about a year now. He does have a tumor there on the prostate that was checked by a urologist and was told it was probably cancer. He is more tired than usual but still works and his appetite is still good, only problems are urinary and he is often achy and sore in the pelvis area and in his shoulders. He eats well and he follows the Dr. Morse fruit diet as much as possible, he is very thin. While I believe both in the natural diet and in western medicine I am very worried about his prognosis and that with such a high PSA number that the cancer has already spread to his bones, etc and it is too late. Am I correct to think this and what can I do to help Him?",

      "Content": "I have encouraged him to have a biopsy but he is against it. Last fall his PSA went up to 200 because of trauma putting the catheter in as he couldn't void. It did go down to 100 last Dec but is steadily increasing and as I said his latest PSA blood test is at 143 with low red blood count as well. I thank you for your advice to have a biopsy without delay and try and reason with him. Thanks for your advice.",
