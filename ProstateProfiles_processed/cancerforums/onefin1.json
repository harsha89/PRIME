      "Content": "Onefin - As Chuck mentioned above PNI is cancerous invasion of the nerves INSIDE THE PROSTATE... It just means that as the tumor grew within the prostate it also grew into the nerve tissue that is in there. Almost everyone has PNI. Another \"scary\" term some people have is \"High Grade PIN\" which sends men and their spouses into a tailspin, \"OMG I have High Grade PIN\"... but it really does not affect the outcome. What's more, your only grade 4 component was secondary and probably small in volume. Grade 4 is the kind of cancer that can escape the prostate and spread. As some background, the prostate is full of nerve tissue but with very little blood supply. That's why the first line of attack is rarely if ever chemo, because the chemo would not reach the tumor. Furthermore your tumors were in the lateral lobes, not near the base which might involve the bladder, and not near the apex, where positive margins are more likely to occur. Also your lymph nodes were all negative, which is no guarantee, but is definitely to your benefit. All in all I would say, DON'T WORRY. Most likely this was nipped in the bud. Many guys would trade anything to have a pathology report like yours. Enjoy your freedom. And congratulations on having excellent continence so far![/QUOTE]",

The perineural invasion if a pathologist just looks for it is present on almost every post surgical examination of the cancerous prostate. for those who have not yet gone there are RALP-I would like to offer some advice as well. First, I would absolutely spend whatever time I had between DX and your surgery practicing mastering and doing your Kegal exercises! I did mine for approximately five weeks and I'm happy to report that my catheter came out two days ago and I have not had so much as a drip or a leak-second night with the padded underwear and dry. Normal urination during the day although still a bit sore . Secondly, walk walk walk and walk some more as soon as you can when you get out of the operating room. They told me all of these horror stories about gas pain and post surgical bowel movements. I got up 15 minutes after they got me back to my room and literally walked for almost an hour through the halls of the hospital and pretty much didn't stop at most of the day. Passed gas and had a bowel movement that evening and felt great. when I got home on day two I walked a mile and a half that day and the subsequent three days walked 3-4 and 5 miles respectively. Not even a trickle of blood in my urine and did not need anything beyond a Tylenol after day two. I am absolutely convinced that the better shape you go in to surgery-the better and quicker your recovery.
