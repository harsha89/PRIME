      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Jar, Welcome to the forum. Here's hoping there will be no need for you to apply for membership in the prostate cancer club. The high end of normal for your age group is around 3.5 and under. So, on the surface, there would seem to be no problem. However, it is a rapid upward trend of PSA readings that raises red flags with many patients. You did have a jump of around .6 in a year's period. Is it possible that this rise might coincide with your urination situation? If the answer is yes, it could be that you are starting to experience BPH (a benign enlargement of the prostate related to age). The more prostate tissue involved, the higher the PSA because it is only prostate tissue that creates PSA. Thus, as your prostate continues to enlarge, the PSA can be expected to gradually rise along with it. Did the uro say anything at all about your prostate being larger than normal? I would say that a biopsy is not quite necessary at this point -- but I would continue monitoring my PSA at regular intervals, perhaps every couple of months. You might also consider a consultation with a second uro (a highly experienced, seasoned one) just for a second opinion. It is also possible to have a higher PSA due to BOTH prostate enlargement and prostate cancer. One uro warned me about this and, a couple years later, he was proven to be correct in my case. Stay tuned to this \"station\" for other comments & advice. Things slow down over the weekend, but you'll probably still find some responses over the next couple days -- and then even more next week before Christmas arrives. Wishing you the best! Chuck Thnks Chuck. Good advice about monitoring my PSA more regularly. I will also set up an appointment for a second appointment. Thanks again",

      "Content": "I am a 51 year old male no family history of PC. I saw my Urologist this week due to a spike in my PSA.. My current PSA is 1.94 up from 1.32 last year (12 months). I have the following PSA scores: 2011=1.59, 2012=1.21, 2013= 1.31, 2014= 1.32, 2015= 1.94. He did a DRE and said everything was normal. He said he saw nothing alarming in my PSA trend data. And my scores just fluctuate. I pushed him a couple of times on what I should do next and he said nothing. He said get retested in a year. He shot down my idea of having a biopsy done. Not needed he said I think a year is to wait to get retested and probably will have another PSA in a couple of months. He did not want to do any further testing at this point. Any suggestions? How long should I wait to get retested? Should I push him to do more testing or just let it go for a while. If this is the start of PC do I have time to wait for further testing? I do urinate frequently and do not empty my bladder completely (I have a slow urine stream). I also get up often at night to pee Thanks! John",
