      "Content": "Hi, this is my first post, but I've lurked over the past few months and I know there are a lot of knowledgeable people on here that I'm hoping can offer some opinions/advice. A couple of years ago during his regular annual exam with his internist (when my husband was around 48ish), his PSA level was high (maybe around 5?). The doctor assumed prostatitis and put him on low dose antibiotics. I can't recall if the PSA level went down at all, but considering he had no other symptoms, he just said they'd check it again the following year. It was still high the next couple of times and he went to a urologist. The urologist did note at that time and still notes to this day that he has an enlarged prostate (but smooth). In fact, even his regular internist has said the same thing. He basically put him on an every 3 month testing cycle until it went up a bit (I think to 6 something) and convinced him to have a biopsy. So, he had an ultrasound-guided biopsy where they took 12 samples and everything came back negative. This was a year ago. He's still having to get his PSA tested every 3 months, though. And even though at this point everything I'm reading is pointing to BPH, the doctor then wants him to have a PCA3 test. Seems to me that the PCA3 would've preceded the biopsy, but I can't talk to my husband about it (I feel like he blindly puts too much faith in doctors while I question more -- I work in the legal department of a healthcare company and I think they're unfortunately concerned about their profits as much as their patients' health). Anyhow, PCA3 comes back negative/low score. Doctor still has him on 3 month testing. He was due for his regular physical anyway back in January, so he had the internist's office do the PSA and send to the urologist. It's now lower than it has been in a couple of years (back to 5 -- after over the past year getting as high as the high 7's). I thought this would finally convince him that it's just BPH because I'm doubting if he had cancer that the PSA would go down. Well, he went to the urologist last week (3 months after the lower one from the internist) and it's now higher than it's ever been -- 8. Doctor wants him to get tested again next month. My question is, how long can this go on? Just keep testing him and testing him (paying a $40 co-pay per urine sample) until what? Until they want to do another biopsy? Can't he just have a high PSA level that's normal for him? I've read that if you have BPH, it's not uncommon for the level to be as high as 10. He does have a large prostate -- that has been confirmed via physical exams and the biopsy when the urologist could see it on the ultrasound. He has no other symptoms other than about a year and half ago, he was getting up to urinate in the middle of the night once or twice. He rarely does now. I just feel like it's a never-ending cycle. Any thoughts/advice? Thanks in advance!",

I'm sure at some point he'll even suggest another biopsy based on the PSA alone and I'm concerned about the risks of multiple biopsies. Considering we know he has an enlarged prostate and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) can cause high PSA levels, why is it treated like it can turn into cancer at any moment just because of the PSA level when other tests have already proven that that's not likely. Thanks for the info, shu246, re: the \"free to total\" PSA ratio. I'll have him inquire about that next month. And NowWhat?, I hope your husband is doing well since his surgery.",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your responses. Good point about the same lab should be testing the results. It could be that those doctors already do use the same lab, but I'd have to check the records. Most of his testing/results have been through the urologist and whichever lab they use. I have a male friend whose PSA level stays between the 5-6 range and has for about 4-5 years. His urologist only tests his PSA level every 6 months and at this point doesn't feel a biopsy is warranted since the level does go up and down and is below 10 (he also has been told he has an enlarged prostate). So, given that my husband has had a negative biopsy, a good report on the PCA3, his levels also go up and down (albeit, high for what is considered \"normal\"), I just feel like every 3 month testing (and now being told to come back 1 month later) is being overly aggressive. Who knows, maybe my friend's doctor is too passive. Like I said in my first post, while I don't dislike doctors in general (I love mine!), I do feel like having you come back, ordering more tests, etc. is in their interest, too. This doctor reminds me of a character that used to be on the TV show \"E.R.\" -- Dr. Romano -- who was a pompous surgeon/chief of staff if anyone watched that show, so maybe that's subconsciously part of my issue with him, LOL. My husband doesn't have any issues with him, though. Thanks for the additional info re: the PSAFT and the 3T MRI. I am a little confused about which test actually provides the free PSA ratio. Is that just a separate blood test from the PSA itself? Or is that a urine test?",

      "Content": "Thanks for your responses. Sorry, I meant to type blood test, not urine sample. I guess I just don't understand where it ends. He's had a biopsy -- 12 \"good samples\" according to his urologist which came back negative. A PCA3 which didn't warrant any concern, and the only thing being a high PSA level (which does go up and down). Can the urologist keep insisting that he gets his PSA tested every 3 months indefinitely? And now this time, he wants him to come back just a month later. I'm sure at some point he'll even suggest another biopsy based on the PSA alone and I'm concerned about the risks of multiple biopsies. Considering we know he has an enlarged prostate and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) can cause high PSA levels, why is it treated like it can turn into cancer at any moment just because of the PSA level when other tests have already proven that that's not likely. Thanks for the info, shu246, re: the \"free to total\" PSA ratio. I'll have him inquire about that next month. And NowWhat?, I hope your husband is doing well since his surgery.",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your responses. Good point about the same lab should be testing the results. It could be that those doctors already do use the same lab, but I'd have to check the records. Most of his testing/results have been through the urologist and whichever lab they use. I have a male friend whose PSA level stays between the 5-6 range and has for about 4-5 years. His urologist only tests his PSA level every 6 months and at this point doesn't feel a biopsy is warranted since the level does go up and down and is below 10 (he also has been told he has an enlarged prostate). So, given that my husband has had a negative biopsy, a good report on the PCA3, his levels also go up and down (albeit, high for what is considered \"normal\"), I just feel like every 3 month testing (and now being told to come back 1 month later) is being overly aggressive. Who knows, maybe my friend's doctor is too passive. Like I said in my first post, while I don't dislike doctors in general (I love mine!), I do feel like having you come back, ordering more tests, etc. is in their interest, too. This doctor reminds me of a character that used to be on the TV show \"E.R.\" -- Dr. Romano -- who was a pompous surgeon/chief of staff if anyone watched that show, so maybe that's subconsciously part of my issue with him, LOL. My husband doesn't have any issues with him, though. Thanks for the additional info re: the PSAFT and the 3T MRI. I am a little confused about which test actually provides the free PSA ratio. Is that just a separate blood test from the PSA itself? Or is that a urine test?",
