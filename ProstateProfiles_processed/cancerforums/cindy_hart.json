      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another A note about the lower colon. It's a muscle and its primary role is to remove water from the stool. It is a recycling machine. It explains the diarrhea when it's function is disrupted or damaged by radiation. The hope is it will recover fully or at least partially. Be aware of possible dehydration. Thank for the comments. I am hopeful that he has a complete recovery but I'm prepared for the fact that he won't. Being the one who is suffering, he is feeling discouraged that there will be any healing. He's been very good about keeping hydrated but he lost his appetite and lost approximately 8 pounds over the course of his treatment. At 6'2, he now weighs about 132 lbs. I'm hoping his appetite returns to normal very soon and he puts that weight back on. Thanks again...all comments and insights are appreciated! -Cindy",

You'll get lots of helpful comments as people begin reading your post. Sounds like he \"had\" a very curable case and it is good to know that whatever the treatment choice -- radiation or surgery -- the cure rate is about the same. So he should do well. In the meantime, let's see what the others have to say. You've already got some good comments up above and I'm sure that more will follow. Please wish your husband good luck for us -- and remind him that there is no shame in jumping on the keyboard to say hello. LOL Chuck Thanks for the welcome Chuck! We found this site to be a wealth of information and very helpful! I'm feeling pretty positive about a complete cure and I think he is too...it's just the lingering side effects that are causing him some consternation. Hopefully, we begin seeing some slow improvement soon. -Cindy",

      "Content": "I joined this forum almost a year ago when my 61 year old husband was first diagnosed with prostrate cancer. He \"claims\" he can't type so I joined on his behalf. While I did a great deal of reading on this site as we researched treatment options, this is my first post. A little starter info...he had a PSA level of 4.37 in December 2015. His primary doctor referred him to a urologist. My husband and the urologist decided on the \"wait and see\" option with a PSA scheduled for 12 months. Due to other health issues (he also has COPD and RA) his next PSA was not done until March 2017 and was 5.25. He went back to the urologist and the subsequent biopsies showed cancer with a Gleason score of 6 in 6 of 12 cores (one 5%; two 10%; two 20%; one 60%). His urologist described the cancer as \"low grade and slow growing\". After some research my husband initially chose seed brachytherapy. Our local cancer center (in the process of moving from one site to another) told us they could not perform brachytherapy for three months. My husband chose to wait. After three months and multiple phone calls and another doctor visit with the RO, we learned that our local cancer center still could not provide brachytherapy and may not be able to for many months. Rather than travel to an area where brachytherapy was available, my husband decided on surgery and was scheduled for January 16, 2018. The urologist sent out a pre-surgery packet including information on what to expect before, during and after the surgery. The day after reading that packet my husband cancelled the surgery and began pursuing EBRT. He began EBRT treatments at the end of January and completed his daily therapy on April 2, 2018. As reported by others on this site he was required to follow a no-gas diet, taking Gas-X multiple times per day and taking a laxative daily. He also had to have a full bladder for the treatment. The daily laxative treatments kept him close to home with frequent and loose bowel movements. Except for the daily treatments, he rarely went out. Having to give up spicy foods, beer and all alcohol were his worst complaints until about week five when he began experiencing the fatigue. He is just now (two weeks post his last treatment) beginning to see an improvement in the fatigue but frequent and loose bowels (with very little warning) continue even without the daily laxative. He is now almost two weeks post treatment and is wondering how long this will last or if it will ever go away. I'm trying to get some anecdotal information for him. While I realize post side effects will vary from person to person, it might help him to know that it won't last forever. Is anyone willing to share if they had this post treatment side effect and how long it lasted? Any responses will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee Yes, I experienced considerable bowel disruption during IMRT/EBRT which still persists to some extend today, six months after the end of treatment. I was not required to take a laxative and when I asked my RO about Gas-X he said that simethicone would be ineffective and Beano would be preferred (I ended up using neither one). Starting midway thru the second week I began to experience frequent urgency and occasional diarrhea, the latter at least 2-3 days a week and the urgency most days, including explosive gas. I wrote about this in the EBRT sticky on the main page of this forum. I think it was around page 10, but could be wrong. It should be easy to find. Most guys say they had no side effects from radiation Tx but it certainly walloped me. I was due for a colonoscopy last year before starting radiation, but because I had so much else going on it was cancelled and rescheduled several times, but eventually postponed until after radiation. Friday I finally get that colonoscopy (start the prep tomorrow), and I am somewhat apprehensive about what the gastroenterologist might find in there as far as radiation damage. I have never had any sort of bowel problems and am typically quite regular... two cups of coffee and five minutes on the throne and I'm done for the day. But ever since the pelvic radiation I often have 2-3 BM's per day, and many mornings a foot long (sorry for the details). The colonoscopy would have required three months of healing before starting RT and after RT I had to wait six months before getting the colo, so it will be good to finally have this out of the way. Whether or not my doctor may find something that might explain the continued SE's and whether or not this condition will continue or may improve with time is something I really don't know. Everything I did for the first year following my surgery was in preparation for starting adjuvant radiation, and it seemed like everything was getting in my way. Good luck to your husband for continued improvement. Hopefully I have not discouraged either of you. Thank you very much Rob for the response....and the details are helpful. Like you, my spouse never had any issues prior to RT and had a morning throne visit after his coffee. Now it's all day with mid-morning being the most active period. I've been trying to convince him he just needs to give his intestines time to recover from the radiation. I also think he has tried to return to his pre-RT diet too quickly and his intestines aren't ready for that yet. Though I don't want to discourage him, it might help him to know that others have experienced a longer \"healing period\". Thanks again and good luck with that colonoscopy! P.S. Thanks for directing me to the EBRT thread. I will spend some time reading it and hopefully glean some encouraging information to share with him. -Cindy",
