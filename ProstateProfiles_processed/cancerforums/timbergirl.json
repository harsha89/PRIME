He has just started experiencing extreme bone pain in his neck, shoulders, back and his left leg and hip. After reading SE of Xtandi, he doesn't want more pain. Would rather have quality of life over quantity at this point. He takes Oxycotone for pain and is up to a pill (5/325) every 4 or 5 hours now. Also lots of fatigue. Any suggestions for pain alleviation? Very open to holistic suggestions as well. Thank you and prayers for all on this site.",
