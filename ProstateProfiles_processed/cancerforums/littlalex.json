      "Content": "Hi Ask - I've been following this short thread and trying to make some sense of it. It does throw me off any interest in your POV when you write such: \"Most people are settled in their ways and views, firmly athiest, religious/theist or spiritual, but there are usually a few in any crowd open to exploring new perspectives on things, or even desperately needing a new map for this human experience of living and inevitably dieing.\" exploring new perspectives on things and desperately needing are about as antithetical as human attitudes/views get. If you didn't sound so damn earnest I wouldn't take anything you've posted here as a germ for discussion, or even reflection. \"Another area to explore is the actual evidence for reincarnation and research that has been done under serious professional protocols, which can diminish our conviction that our existence ends at death, reducing fear.\" -- Zoom, see ya! The primary human coping mechanism for dealing with one's own extinction has been, is and will always be denial. Any discussion would have to spring from that fact. Regards, Littlalex",
