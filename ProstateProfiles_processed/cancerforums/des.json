      "Content": "Husband had been on Taxotere with good results x 3 or 4 administrations, then stopped working. Abiratirone did not work on him. Jevtana has been very effective, still works after 4 administrations. However..... the side effects can be very severe, at least in his case. He has had severe neutropenia despite getting the injection to 'prevent' that from happening (Neulasta). He has also had severe gastrointestinal symptoms, including an inflammation of the entire GI tract (mucositis), and then some unexpected GI bleeding (possibly related). Severe reaction on 2 of the 4 administrations, mild on the middle two administrations. His doctor is planning to give him jevtana in another month at 1/3 the regular dose to see if this prevents the side effects. We are also awaiting the 2 newer drugs that are on a fast track at the FDA. So, to answer: Jevtana has worked well, the first time amazingly well in decreasing the PSA. But watch out for the side effects. Probably not enough experience with the drug yet to know if this is going to be frequent, or his is an unusual case.",
