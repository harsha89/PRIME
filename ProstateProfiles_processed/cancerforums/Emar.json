      "Content": "Hello Everyone..My husband was just diagnosed after 8 biopsies that began in 2005. He is 60 years old and we live in the Philadelphia PA area. Here is some background... PSA...8.3 in 2005 32.61 in 2017 PSA scores between these two years look like this... 13.7 9/05 12.3 11/05 10.8 3/08 9.5 5/06 9.8 3/07 10.4 7/07 6.2 7/08 10.9 3/09 23.4 6/10 16.8 12/10 20.0 7/11 19.6 1/12 19.8 7/12 13.8 6/13 16.4 1/14 14.0 7/14 19.2 1/15 53.0 8/15 UTI...took Cipro went down to 22.2 28.9 5/16 27.81 10/16 28.7 11/16 30.52 3/17 32.61 4/17 Biopsies....all benign except for 8th one March/05 Dec./05 June/09 July/10 Jan./14(saturation) July/16 Aug/16(fusion) May/17(fusion) 2010.....had second opinion at John Hopkins University MRI Endorectal 1.5 Tesla June/16 Volume. 82.3 MRI endorectal 1.5 tesla Dec/16.

His slides are being sent to John Hopkins for second opinion. This is all we know so far..... Left lateral apex...Gleason 6 (3+3) involving 5% Left mid MRI fusion nodule Gleason 6 (3+3). 25% We are so worried with all these years of elevated PSA. Thoughts anyone? Has anyone had a similar case with so many biopsies over so many years? The phone call with the ordering of the bone scan just made me more nervous. Worried that there are other areas that may be a higher Gleason score since it has been like looking for a needle in the haystack just to find these two.",
