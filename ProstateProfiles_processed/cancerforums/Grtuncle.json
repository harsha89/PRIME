      "Content": "Hello I'm back unfortunately. Last time I was hear I had been put on large dose of Cipro and asked about side affects, unfortunately that was a no no and thread was locked. Anyway Cipro almost caused me to almost have stroke, it made my BP dangerously high, then I switched to Bactrim...made me suicidal, fortunately I had the good sense to know better, that I was not myself. After 4-6 weeks of those poisons, I had another PSA. My PSA is still at 3.7 on the 0-4 scale last years PSA was 0. Dr says much to high for someone my age (2 months I will be 50) and health. Now I'm scheduled for a Biopsy on the 21st. I want to know everything you can tell me...I have read everything I can get my hands on but nothing is better than getting info from those who experienced it. All I can tell you is that it will be done in office with a numbing gel and a local anesthesia to the prostate, he is going to take 12 samples. I have the enema....that was embarrassing to buy (just me being stupid) I was good in DRs office until I went to leave, and DR shook my hand and said \" I'm sorry, I wish it would have turned out different for you\" That unnerved me. I had to sit in my car for awhile, before I left just to clear my head. So please tell me what you know... I am kinda flying solo here, I have no wife, no kids, no GF so I am mostly on my on.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Grt, Actually, the \"powers that be\" locked your original thread because, at that time, you were not posting in relation to having prostate cancer -- and this is a forum only for PC patients or caregivers or those with relatives/close friends with PC. But as you are now preparing to have a prostate biopsy, that kind of puts you within the radar of this forum and we're glad to offer our thoughts, comments & experiences to you -- and our advice. We also have a sticky thread, near the top of the list of threads, called \"What I Need to Know About About Prostate Biopsy.\" It is a long discussion and you might find some help in perusing it. In the meantime, yes your PSA is kind of on the higher side for your age and it does warrant a biopsy. Sorry to hear you are directed to take an enema. This policy differs among various doctors. I hate those things and was very happy when my own uro just had me drink Magnesium Citrate. No enema was ordered. I was further surprised when, the day prior to my prostate removal surgery at Mayo, I was not even required to do that. In fact, I was allowed to eat normally up to midnight the night before. Your doctor, in what he said to you, probably just meant he was sorry that an infection was ruled out -- which left the biopsy as the next step. He did not mean that you have cancer. He just meant that you need the biopsy. And ONLY a biopsy can diagnose prostate cancer. Be sure that the doctor uses a numbing jell before inserting the probe. Once the probe is where the sun doesn't shine, make sure (talk to him in advance, of course) that he then injects the prostate with a pain killer. Then you will not feel anything except the pressure from the probe's presence & it will be basically pain-free. Also, I moved your post over into the Prostate Cancer Forum so that it will be read by as many of us as possible -- and will get you as much help as possible. Wishing you the best results from the biopsy. Please feel free to ask any questions and also to let us know what the biopsy report says. Good luck! Chuck Probably should have left that first part out, I was wrong...but my emotions are kinda running loose and free at moment.....yes DR is going to use numbing gel before injection...yeah I know what Doc meant but...it just made me really think for first time what it could be. Thanx for saying it is painless...I was quite worried about that and the hour drive home.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ron_G You'll be fine. I found the numbing gel made for a much better 2nd biopsy. I didn't get that during the first. You'll lie on your side, get the gel, then the 'probe' for an initial ultrasound. The doc will do some basics, like measuring your prostate and looking for anything suspicious. Then the numbing needle, followed by the biopsy needles. 12 samples is pretty much standard. You won't really be able to see what the doc's doing (not that you want to!), but you'll hear a 'snap' as the gun shoots off and maybe a little pinch-if that. It won't take long at all. Afterwards, I was told to sit in a small area until I could urinate in a cup. I believe they were checking for clots and anything unusual. You'll have some blood-tinged urine for a few days and likely some dried blood and small clots, as well as, frankly, gross semen! Think tar! But it'll go away soon enough. I found that the more you have a reason to ejaculate, the faster it clears up (don't judge me! ). You'll be fine to drive yourself since only a local is used. I had no pain afterwards. Heck, I hardly even had any blood from the tush--both times! Your doc seemed like a bit of a downer, but I'm sure he was just wishing he could've ruled out PC completely and no biopsy would be necessary. Even HE doesn't know what's going on at this point. P.S., I'm a believer in having a 3T MRI prior to biopsy if possible. It can help identify 'suspicious' areas and allow for a MRI-guided 'fusion biopsy.' Not all docs are onboard with this protocol as of yet though. P.S.S., When buying products like Fleet enemas, do what I do when I have to buy feminine products.....First, use a grocery store and not a local drug store. Be sure to buy lots of unnecessary things to mask what you have, and use SELF CHECKOUT!!! P.S.S.S., Can you advise if you have a family history of PC (you're on the young side for this), and your location? I bought it out of town, same place I get condoms, my luck I will walk into my minister, which I did when getting a bottle of wine at Grocery store...we are supposed to be teetotalers...but I don't follow the man made rules.

P.S.S.S., Can you advise if you have a family history of PC (you're on the young side for this), and your location? I bought it out of town, same place I get condoms, my luck I will walk into my minister, which I did when getting a bottle of wine at Grocery store...we are supposed to be teetotalers...but I don't follow the man made rules. I am in Low-country of South Carolina near Charleston and hour away from the city. My Mothers Brother had PC about 10 years ago I guess, that would have made him 59/60, he had his removed. Grandfather 91, Mothers father had something done to his prostate in his 70's...he's leaked ever since, but I have no idea what was done. Fathers family...no instances, but until recently most of male members of family died relatively young. My Father and his brother 71 and 78 are two oldest males in family. If it turns out to be PC I have 11 cousins and Brother to tell to get checked.",

But as you are now preparing to have a prostate biopsy, that kind of puts you within the radar of this forum and we're glad to offer our thoughts, comments & experiences to you -- and our advice. We also have a sticky thread, near the top of the list of threads, called \"What I Need to Know About About Prostate Biopsy.\" It is a long discussion and you might find some help in perusing it. In the meantime, yes your PSA is kind of on the higher side for your age and it does warrant a biopsy. Sorry to hear you are directed to take an enema. This policy differs among various doctors. I hate those things and was very happy when my own uro just had me drink Magnesium Citrate. No enema was ordered. I was further surprised when, the day prior to my prostate removal surgery at Mayo, I was not even required to do that. In fact, I was allowed to eat normally up to midnight the night before. Your doctor, in what he said to you, probably just meant he was sorry that an infection was ruled out -- which left the biopsy as the next step. He did not mean that you have cancer. He just meant that you need the biopsy. And ONLY a biopsy can diagnose prostate cancer. Be sure that the doctor uses a numbing jell before inserting the probe. Once the probe is where the sun doesn't shine, make sure (talk to him in advance, of course) that he then injects the prostate with a pain killer. Then you will not feel anything except the pressure from the probe's presence & it will be basically pain-free. Also, I moved your post over into the Prostate Cancer Forum so that it will be read by as many of us as possible -- and will get you as much help as possible. Wishing you the best results from the biopsy. Please feel free to ask any questions and also to let us know what the biopsy report says. Good luck! Chuck Probably should have left that first part out, I was wrong...but my emotions are kinda running loose and free at moment.....yes DR is going to use numbing gel before injection...yeah I know what Doc meant but...it just made me really think for first time what it could be.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ron_G You'll be fine. I found the numbing gel made for a much better 2nd biopsy. I didn't get that during the first. You'll lie on your side, get the gel, then the 'probe' for an initial ultrasound. The doc will do some basics, like measuring your prostate and looking for anything suspicious. Then the numbing needle, followed by the biopsy needles. 12 samples is pretty much standard. You won't really be able to see what the doc's doing (not that you want to!), but you'll hear a 'snap' as the gun shoots off and maybe a little pinch-if that. It won't take long at all. Afterwards, I was told to sit in a small area until I could urinate in a cup. I believe they were checking for clots and anything unusual. You'll have some blood-tinged urine for a few days and likely some dried blood and small clots, as well as, frankly, gross semen! Think tar! But it'll go away soon enough. I found that the more you have a reason to ejaculate, the faster it clears up (don't judge me! ). You'll be fine to drive yourself since only a local is used. I had no pain afterwards. Heck, I hardly even had any blood from the tush--both times! Your doc seemed like a bit of a downer, but I'm sure he was just wishing he could've ruled out PC completely and no biopsy would be necessary. Even HE doesn't know what's going on at this point. P.S., I'm a believer in having a 3T MRI prior to biopsy if possible. It can help identify 'suspicious' areas and allow for a MRI-guided 'fusion biopsy.' Not all docs are onboard with this protocol as of yet though. P.S.S., When buying products like Fleet enemas, do what I do when I have to buy feminine products.....First, use a grocery store and not a local drug store.
