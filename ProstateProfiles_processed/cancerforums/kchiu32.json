    "Content": "Hi everyone, I am posting for my dad 67 year old with hypertension and high cholesterol. Otherwise generally healthy. Testing: PSA currently at 7. Peak of 10 at one point but lowered with finasteride and tamsulosin. Biopsy: Left lobe ok Right lobe Gleason score 4+3=7 noted in 2 out of 2 submitted core segments. Approximately 36% of submitted tissue involved. Future: Just got a chest xray done. Will be getting a bone scan soon. Doctor is recommending robotic radical prostatectomy. Should we get a second opinion and see if this procedure is really necessary? I am hesitant for him to undergo this after reading about all the potential adverse effects following the procedure.",
