The reason he gave me for low risk of reoccurrence at the apex was lack of blood flow to area. At the time, it sounded like he was throwing me a bone -- but if your surgeon said the same Oshguy, then I feel better about it, thanks. Ps, Merc, I was in the other thread today, please take it easy a little longer buddy. Lol.",

      "Content": "So you guys I just got the hard copy of my pathology: Some of it is straightforward. Adenocarcinoma, Gleason 4+3 Score 7. Tumor present at right and left apex, in 7 of 26 slides. Comprising <5% of prostate gland. Prostate 32.8g. Tumor focally present (<200nm) right posterior apex margin. All other margins free of tumor. No extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicles free of tumor, 11/11 lymph nodes negative. No lymph or vascular invasion. Perineural invasion present. Now here is the concept I was hoping you guys could clue me in on: In the fine print... Margin involved by invasive carcinoma, focal right apex (Gleason 4), without extraprostatic extension (inked margin within prostate tissue) So, I remember Walsh saying in his book that the apex was tough because there was no clear demarcation of where prostate ends and spincter begins. My impression of the above is that the tumor was still in the prostate but there was still some prostatic tissue on the other side of the margin? If that is the case how do you track PSA post op? Will I ever have a non detectable PSA if there is still prostatic tissue in there? I'm guessing this is the part of the game, but any thoughts?",

So I'm probably the typical diffuse change of the whole prostatic gland.

      "Content": "Ok you guys, give me some feedback if you have time on this one. I just got off the phone with my urologist. While I was deciding about surgery I had him run the Prolaris test on my biopsy tissue. I had essentially decided to do the robot and ditch AS while I was waiting to hear from him. The score was -1.5 (no idea what the reference range was), but that puts me in a \"very low risk\" grouping apparently. I was getting the vibe from the uro that he is leaning toward AS now, but I may be reading too much into his inflection and I know it's a choice I that I have make. Any experience with the test? Fairly new, but is a DNA assay to determine aggressiveness of cell division.",

I had an unremarkable recovery, but I can't say it was a lot of fun.

I was not one of the guys that got though it on tylenol only, lol. I don't know, I'm a big, tough guy in theory, but I was in the market pretty quicky for narcotics after my procedure. I had an unremarkable recovery, but I can't say it was a lot of fun. My second night was the worst really, I think the local wore off on the body wall incisions and I was at home in a normal bed, so getting up and down was rough. Hang in there.

I was referred to a Urologist, and he offered the full range of options. I elected to take the new(er) PHI panel. The PHI came back as a 45 index reading, with a 32.7 % chance of cancer being present. The PSA within the panel was actually trending down (3.2) but free PSA was low at six percent, I believe. My urologist sounded very concerned and biopsies are scheduled. Let's just say the more I research the worse I feel about the situation. I can't find a lot of reference material for men in their 40's, which isn't helping me either. Many examples found just reference the aggressive forms of PC found in my age bracket. I keep trying to find a statistic to hold on to, but it just feels like a game of odds -- there will be three straws that day ...and don't pick the short one. I was hoping someone could give me some insight into how stressed one should be at this point, but I'm going into it with my eyes open. Does anybody have experience with the PHI?

      "Content": "Hello All. First post. I'm 45 with a +1 family history of PC. No symptoms, normal DRE. PSA two and a half years ago was 2.0 PSA last month was 3.5 on routine wellness screen. I was referred to a Urologist, and he offered the full range of options. I elected to take the new(er) PHI panel. The PHI came back as a 45 index reading, with a 32.7 % chance of cancer being present. The PSA within the panel was actually trending down (3.2) but free PSA was low at six percent, I believe. My urologist sounded very concerned and biopsies are scheduled. Let's just say the more I research the worse I feel about the situation. I can't find a lot of reference material for men in their 40's, which isn't helping me either. Many examples found just reference the aggressive forms of PC found in my age bracket. I keep trying to find a statistic to hold on to, but it just feels like a game of odds -- there will be three straws that day ...and don't pick the short one. I was hoping someone could give me some insight into how stressed one should be at this point, but I'm going into it with my eyes open. Does anybody have experience with the PHI? Thank you ahead of time.",

      "Content": "Hey Guys, I don't have my Walsh book yet (on order), and I'm trying to wrap my head around the semantics on my recent path. report, just so I'm not looking through rose colored glasses. In addition to the two cores that showed 3+3, I had two cores which showed atypical small acinar proliferations. Each were small with one to three acinar aggregates. One had the absence of a basal cell layer by some type of cytokeratin cocktail and AMACR stains, and a path note saying \"by size criterion the finding is not consistent with adenocarcinoma\". I guess I was looking for some insight as to is this a precursor to adenocarcinoma and should I assume it as such? Meaning I really have four core positive samples? My understanding thus far is that high grade PIN's can go cancerous eventually, but unsure as to the ASAP lesions? One resource implied that ASAPs meant that the pathologist can't say it's a carcinoma, but has suspicion. I'm sure some of it is irrelevant, if I have 3+3, it doesn't change my treantment options -- but does it change prognosis, if more then one site of PC found? Thanks ahead of time.",

      "Content": "Well, I guess I can answer my own question now. Walsh does touch on this briefly in his book, but there is also a resource on the John Hopkins website. The short answer looks like yes. They are definite \"maybe\" for cellular changes associated with carcinoma -- probably not big enough yet to give the pathologist a true read. Additionally, you want to look harder for PC if you have these findings without a definitive positive on your biopsies. Now I get that it is a multifocal disease, that causes a field change in the whole gland. My impression is that traditionally three to seven small tumors are found on most prostatectomies and this doesn't change prognosis if still contained. I sent my slides on to Epstein for a second opinion BTW.",
