      "Content": "Hi It seems those in the know are recommending cialis 5mg daily to start if your neural tissue is only lightly 'stunned' from the op then you should be a responder to meds and its worthwhile continuing with them If you don't notice any changes maybe discuss using a booster dose of cialis with your GP (make sure you take them on an empty stomach though) If still a non responder there is some merit (certainly financially!) in ceasing the drugs and trying another approach for a while then retrying the drugs in a couple of months Maybe injection therapy would work well in this case of non drug responsiveness Penile rehab needs blood flow and I know over here in Australia we try to encourage 2-3 erections per week (either voluntary or induced) to maintain health penile blood flow Hope this helps with your decision making Stuart",

      "Content": "Hi Bob You make some interesting points. Ornish et al 2013 just released a poignant paper on lifestyle modifications for men on AS which despite its small size merits consideration. My take on things is based on the fact that historically we know incontinence in women is helped by pelvic floor training but unfortunately we have just assumed that strength training is therefore going to benefit men following prostate surgery. With the damage done during childbirth to the female pelvic floor (stretch/tear) it makes sense to recover with a strength program, but the surgical trauma during prostatectomy is quite different. I don't have the answers (yet!) but I'm looking. I personally think that we may need a period of time (about 3 weeks) post op where we just plain rest and take it easy. Allow mother nature to recover naturally and listen to our bodies. I tell most of my guys to undertake predominately dry activities only (even if this means to rest up, sit down and avoid all activities that cause the recovering sphincter muscles to fail - i.e. leak) I also think that it is beneficial to undertake a period of preoperative motor training (skill acquisition) whereby we use the ultrasound machine transperineally to teach guys how to bias more contractile effort AWAY from the anal sphincter (levator ani) and more towards the puboperineals/external urinary sphincter (penile bias) My first study (currently awaiting review for publication) showed that you can teach the skill of motor acquisition within a clinically reasonable period form most guys (1.5 physio sessions average) but the most success in skill acquisition occurred in the group we saw pre operatively. Maybe we don't need strength Maybe we just need to restimulate the motor memory through more selective biassing of our kegel exercises ( a bit like golf....dont just focus on hitting the ball hard....maybe improve your swing first!!) I'm finding the research bit tough as I'ma through and through clinician but I feel we need to focus on research rather than just churn out the 'womens health' solution to a mens health problem Stuart",
