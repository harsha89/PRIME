Orgasm is achievable though and i've found that if i empty my bladder immediately before, i do not leak. Also, if i'm on my back, i'm far less likely to leak. So - let her do the work for a while and you might be surprised. Best of luck and keep it pointed up. Cheers",

Post op internal urine leaking visible through cystogram and felt like unbelievable labor cramps 3-4 times per day. Catheter remained in place for 31 long days. I felt hopeless on several occasions but my wife dragged me on. Constipation (should be written in capital letters) beyond description. Had my first post op PSA at >0.05. This came with no explanation and was perceived by me as not being zero and therefore, more bad news. Fortunately my Urologist was available and explained that this is goodness... At 66 days, I leak when i stand, cough, sneeze, clear my throat, and laugh. Doing my exercises but no progress. Thinking of buying Tena stock... Despite sparing 1 nerve, there is no erection. Insurance refuses 5mg daily Cialis but approves 2.5mg despite price being the same. No effect whatsoever... Whoda thunk at 54, no sex and wearing panty liners. Hopeful but not too confident. I could live with the incontinence if only the ED could be solved. Having a wife 18 years younger than me used to be a thrilling thing. Good luck to you all, Dan",
