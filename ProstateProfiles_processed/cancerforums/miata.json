      "Content": "Hello, I had an open RP in 2009 at a VA hospital in Columbia MO. My PSA was <.1 till Jul 2013 and then rose to .2. My wife freaked out and we were off to Mayo clinic in Rochester MN for a 2nd opinion. Everything I have read say's to start RT at .2. Mayo said I should watch PSA and return when it is 1.0 and they will preform a C-11 PET choline scan. I'm not comfortable having IMRT done at the University of Missouri hospital in Columbia. I have a severe panic disorder and have a lot of abdominal cramping/movement. They said they use the RP surgical staples to define the prostate bed. I think I might need calypso or another IMRT. I have no problem with Mayo but don't understand waiting. My wife is looking at other options for treatment, but, we could use some help. Thanks!!!",
