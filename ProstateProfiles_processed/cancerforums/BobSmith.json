      "Content": "Eight months after a radical prosatectomy my PSA is still negligible, but it's on the rise (see below). I have an appointment to see my surgeon in three months. I expect that I will probably cross the 0.1 PSA mark at about that time. So I am trying to plan ahead and be ready. I have a great surgeon locally, but am considering the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN for salvage radiation treatment if that is needed. The problem is, I'm several hours away and would need to move to Rochester for a few weeks. It's just too far to commute. So these questions come to mind: 1) Is the selection of a radiation oncologist really all that critical, or are the results of salvage radiation therapy for prostate cancer pretty much the same from one center to the next? 2) Does anyone know how difficult is it to schedule salvage treatment at the Mayo Clinic as a new patient? I expect that once I cross that 0.1 mark I'll want to move pretty quickly based on studies I have read. Has anyone had experience with switching centers/providers in the middle of the action? Thanks.",
