My stats are below and I don't know what to look for as far as the direction my cancer is taking me. I was diagnosed last March 2016. June DaVinci removal . Diagnosed as aggressive after my first biopsy from the Urologist. He had me to the Oncologist quickly and planed the surgery. Surgery was as successful as I hoped. PSA 0. PSA second .024 Third .042. With 3 months to \"recover\" Oncologist moved to radiation . I just completed that and now have a PSA of .080. Not the New Years celebration I hoped for. So I have never really gone to PSA zero since my first test after the prostate was removed. My next PSA will be the end of January 2017, meeting with the Oncologist first week of February for that review. Oncologist said at the .080 that we didn't \"hit\" where we need to be. Has anyone had this scenerio? What have you done? Definitely looks like I continue to have cancer. thank you...",
