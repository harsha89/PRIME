      "Content": "Hi Bob, thanks for the reply. I am 67, PSA 8.77, Gleason score 6 (3+3). Of the 12 samples taken it appears there is cancer in 2 of them at 5%. DRE appears normal. Urologist says it appears in the very early detection stage. He says I am a good candidate for \"Active Surveillance\". I go back to see him on the 20th of Nov to discuss my options. I was not shocked at my diagnosis or even that surprised. I have a family history of PC. My Dad and 2 of his brothers had PC. I am also looking at IMRT. Just have a couple million questions on just about everything involved in the whole process. I have ordered a couple books on line and the doc gave me several books and literature that I have pretty much already overwelmed me. Any help or direction would certainly be appreciated. Thanks, Brian",
