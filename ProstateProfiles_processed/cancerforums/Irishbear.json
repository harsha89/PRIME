      "Content": "Hello. First post so here are my vitals: * CURRENT - Age 57 * For past 17 years extreme avid runner, cardio and eat healthy.* No smoking. Limited wine intake. * Physical 4.5 years ago (at age 52), elevated PSA of 6.02. At that time I was WHAT IS A PSA??? * Referred to Urologist. PSA drop to 5.04, biopsy taken. At this time I was, HUH? WHAT?? What is a Biopsy let alone a prostate??? All clear. NO CANCER. * PSA taken once a quarter (4 x's year) for 2 years. Stable. * Move to PSA twice a year for a year. Stable. * Move to PSA once year. Stable * Stable was a range of 5.4 to 7.4. * PSA taken in November 2016 - PSA 14.7. * Outlier?? PSA taken 6 weeks late - 10.9. * Sinus infection at the time of 10.9 so 8 weeks later another PSA - 10.2. * MRO ordered. * Results \"an area of suspicion\". Area of suspicion??? What is that? * Biopsy March 31. * Prostate Cancer positive. * positive 2 cores - Left Medial Mid 20%. Left Medial Apex 15% * Gleason 3+4=7 * T1a stage. Met with Urologist for consultation regarding biopsy outcome and my options. Options are Radiation or Surgery. Dr. strongly encouraged me to seek second opinions include to meet with a Radiation Oncologist, Medical Oncologist and even a different Urologist. I have done all with exception of another Urologist - This meeting will take place next week. * Radiation Oncologist did not specify his recommendation BUT his comments were consistent towards surgery. WHY? The age thing. Said in his practice he likes to use radiation on older patients. I asked why. He says that if I were to choose radiation AND if the cancer came back, my only choices at that time would be cryotherapy of Hormone Therapy. Said at this age of 57 if cancer were to come bac, alotof time for it to grow. He additionally detailed the POTENTIAL of rectal problems and/or bladder cancer with radiation. Again, POTENTIAL is all. * Medical Oncologist.* He touted the benefits/downside to both radiation and surgery and to my surprise came out and recommended surgery.* The main reason was my age.* I have said previously that society considers me somewhat old BUT in this arena it certainly appears I am a young buck.* WHAT?? In addition to the age*consideration, he did detail for me the question I had regarding radiation*AFTER surgery.*He*explained the if I elected the EBRT route and cancer returned, surgery is not an option.* The radiation effects to much surrounding tissue. If I chose Brachytherapy and cancer returned, he did say that surgery is very troublesome. I asked what that meant.* He detailed that since radiation destroys surrounding tissue-but Brachyterapy not as much as EBRT- surgery following radiation is not a real good option.* All three Dr.s detailed the possibility (due to radiation) of rectal cancer and bladder cancer.* My age gives these cancers more time to develop. Again, these are a POSSIBILTY not guarantee. So, if the cancer were to return after surgery,*I have a surgeon telling me Surgery is not an option if I choose Radiation.* I have a Radiation Oncologist telling me Surgery is not an option following Radiation.* I have a Medical Oncologist WAVERING regarding if Surgery is an option following surgery.* The only options*would be*Cryotherapy or Hormone Therapy. All three Dr's consistently hit on \"young age\" and the importance to remove the cancer now.* All said if I was late 60's and beyond, we probably would not be discussing surgery at all - only Radiation options. The Medical Oncologist did say that he would recommend a bone scan though.* When I had my consultation with my primary Urologist,**he had said that he did not feel a bone scan was warranted.* Well since I have gone down the road of getting many \"second opinions\", I am going to go ahead and get a bone scan.* If I solicit second opinions from some really fine Doctors, I should at least listen - right?? I have one more \"second opinion\" set for next week.* This is with a different Urologist. So that's where I at. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hello KitKat. I am also 57 like your husband. I am 8 weeks \"on the other side\" of surgery. Since same age and relatively same timing, I'll share my experience: * I was AS for 5 years. * Picture perfect health. Cardio 6 days week for 27 years. Always ate good. No smoking. Wine occasionally. Wife of 37 years. Two kids. ALL GOOD. * Had Biopsy 5 years ago - no issues. * UNTIL February this year - PSA shot up to over 13- retested twice and both results were around 10. * Now action was needed. * First step was MRI - found \"area of suspicion\". * Second step was Biopsy of 12 cores and specific target to the \"area of suspicion\". * Results - Prostate Cancer. 2 of 12 cores. * Gleason 3+4=7. * Clinical Stage - T1cNOMO * Two months of visiting Radiation Oncologists, Medical Oncologists and second opinion from a different Urologist. * As you must know already, this is a highly personalized disease. MANY variables come into play when making a decision on course of action by each individual. * Decided on Radical Laparoscopic Prostatectomy. * Post surgery now. My surgery was July 10. * I was in hospital from Monday through Thursday. * Pathologist report came back on Wednesday and final reading of prostate was 4+3=7 (versus 3+4=7). Clinical Stage T2cNOMO (versus T1cNOMO). * This increase is NOT UNCOMMON. * My surgery was 7:30 am. I finally woke up about 1:15. Dozed off and on. * Has some broth later in evening and then sleep. * Next morning was only interested in some bland Cream of Wheat and Tea and this was about 10:30. I don't LIKE Tea but sounded good?? Weird stuff. * Tired and no energy throughout day. * Was not hungry for lunch. Dinner only Cream of Wheat sounded good and chicken broth. * Now about the passing gas. FINALLY passed some gas at 7:02am Wednesday. You remember the BIG events! * Now was interested in Cream of Wheat, some toast and yogurt. * I thought passing gas was the BIG event. UH-NO. * At some point, ya have to have a Bowel Movement. * So after the cream of wheat, toast, yogurt, I'm laying in bed and BOOM! EXCRUCIATING STOMACH pains! I mean worst thing I have felt. * 2 Nurses came running in, asked my wife questions and automatically said \"We need to get him up\"! * KEY POINT, It WILL BE SLOW BUT get your husband up and walking around - FAST. * Again, MY PERSPECTIVE ONLY, It felt VERY odd walking around with a catheter in place. This was one of my \"stress points\" throughout this thing. Ridiculous - Right?? * Get him walking fast. Gotta get that gas to work down. * Ok now better but still gotta do the BM at some point. * The time came and for me, it was stressful and awkward. I was in my own bathroom in my room BUT now had a catheter hanging out of me, painful gas and need to have a BM. * No to be crude but I passed the loudest gas followed by BM that was somewhat painful. * My catheter also felt odd. BUT I had never had a BM with a catheter before! * MAJOR relief that I passed gas and had a BM. Now I had some confidence on what my recovery would entail. * Released and went home Thursday. * Was at home for 2 weeks before Catheter was removed. * Learn all about the LEG bag during the day! * I thought the BIG DAY was surgery day. TO ME, the BIG day is the follow-up PSA day. * I received my follow-up PSA 7 weeks post surgery and UNDETECTABLE. THAT is the BIG DAY. So hopefully by the time you read this, your Husband is through surgery and in recovery. Keep us all informed and to me, NO QUESTION is odd, embarrassing or out of line. Godspeed!",

      "Content": "Hello. First post so here are my vitals: * CURRENT - Age 57 * For past 17 years extreme avid runner, cardio and eat healthy.* No smoking. Limited wine intake. * Physical 4.5 years ago (at age 52), elevated PSA of 6.02. At that time I was WHAT IS A PSA??? * Referred to Urologist. PSA drop to 5.04, biopsy taken. At this time I was, HUH? WHAT?? What is a Biopsy let alone a prostate??? All clear. NO CANCER. * PSA taken once a quarter (4 x's year) for 2 years. Stable. * Move to PSA twice a year for a year. Stable. * Move to PSA once year. Stable * Stable was a range of 5.4 to 7.4. * PSA taken in November 2016 - PSA 14.7. * Outlier?? PSA taken 6 weeks late - 10.9. * Sinus infection at the time of 10.9 so 8 weeks later another PSA - 10.2. * MRO ordered. * Results \"an area of suspicion\". Area of suspicion??? What is that? * Biopsy March 31. * Prostate Cancer positive. * positive 2 cores - Left Medial Mid 20%. Left Medial Apex 15% * Gleason 3+4=7 * T1a stage. Met with Urologist for consultation regarding biopsy outcome and my options. Options are Radiation or Surgery. Dr. strongly encouraged me to seek second opinions include to meet with a Radiation Oncologist, Medical Oncologist and even a different Urologist. I have done all with exception of another Urologist - This meeting will take place next week. * Radiation Oncologist did not specify his recommendation BUT his comments were consistent towards surgery. WHY? The age thing. Said in his practice he likes to use radiation on older patients. I asked why. He says that if I were to choose radiation AND if the cancer came back, my only choices at that time would be cryotherapy of Hormone Therapy. Said at this age of 57 if cancer were to come bac, alotof time for it to grow. He additionally detailed the POTENTIAL of rectal problems and/or bladder cancer with radiation. Again, POTENTIAL is all. * Medical Oncologist.* He touted the benefits/downside to both radiation and surgery and to my surprise came out and recommended surgery.* The main reason was my age.* I have said previously that society considers me somewhat old BUT in this arena it certainly appears I am a young buck.* WHAT?? In addition to the age*consideration, he did detail for me the question I had regarding radiation*AFTER surgery.*He*explained the if I elected the EBRT route and cancer returned, surgery is not an option.* The radiation effects to much surrounding tissue. If I chose Brachytherapy and cancer returned, he did say that surgery is very troublesome. I asked what that meant.* He detailed that since radiation destroys surrounding tissue-but Brachyterapy not as much as EBRT- surgery following radiation is not a real good option.* All three Dr.s detailed the possibility (due to radiation) of rectal cancer and bladder cancer.* My age gives these cancers more time to develop. Again, these are a POSSIBILTY not guarantee. So, if the cancer were to return after surgery,*I have a surgeon telling me Surgery is not an option if I choose Radiation.* I have a Radiation Oncologist telling me Surgery is not an option following Radiation.* I have a Medical Oncologist WAVERING regarding if Surgery is an option following surgery.* The only options*would be*Cryotherapy or Hormone Therapy. All three Dr's consistently hit on \"young age\" and the importance to remove the cancer now.* All said if I was late 60's and beyond, we probably would not be discussing surgery at all - only Radiation options. The Medical Oncologist did say that he would recommend a bone scan though.* When I had my consultation with my primary Urologist,**he had said that he did not feel a bone scan was warranted.* Well since I have gone down the road of getting many \"second opinions\", I am going to go ahead and get a bone scan.* If I solicit second opinions from some really fine Doctors, I should at least listen - right?? I have one more \"second opinion\" set for next week.* This is with a different Urologist. So that's where I at. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hello KitKat. I am also 57 like your husband. I am 8 weeks \"on the other side\" of surgery. Since same age and relatively same timing, I'll share my experience: * I was AS for 5 years. * Picture perfect health. Cardio 6 days week for 27 years. Always ate good. No smoking. Wine occasionally. Wife of 37 years. Two kids. ALL GOOD. * Had Biopsy 5 years ago - no issues. * UNTIL February this year - PSA shot up to over 13- retested twice and both results were around 10. * Now action was needed. * First step was MRI - found \"area of suspicion\". * Second step was Biopsy of 12 cores and specific target to the \"area of suspicion\". * Results - Prostate Cancer. 2 of 12 cores. * Gleason 3+4=7. * Clinical Stage - T1cNOMO * Two months of visiting Radiation Oncologists, Medical Oncologists and second opinion from a different Urologist. * As you must know already, this is a highly personalized disease. MANY variables come into play when making a decision on course of action by each individual. * Decided on Radical Laparoscopic Prostatectomy. * Post surgery now. My surgery was July 10. * I was in hospital from Monday through Thursday. * Pathologist report came back on Wednesday and final reading of prostate was 4+3=7 (versus 3+4=7). Clinical Stage T2cNOMO (versus T1cNOMO). * This increase is NOT UNCOMMON. * My surgery was 7:30 am. I finally woke up about 1:15. Dozed off and on. * Has some broth later in evening and then sleep. * Next morning was only interested in some bland Cream of Wheat and Tea and this was about 10:30. I don't LIKE Tea but sounded good?? Weird stuff. * Tired and no energy throughout day. * Was not hungry for lunch. Dinner only Cream of Wheat sounded good and chicken broth. * Now about the passing gas. FINALLY passed some gas at 7:02am Wednesday. You remember the BIG events! * Now was interested in Cream of Wheat, some toast and yogurt. * I thought passing gas was the BIG event. UH-NO. * At some point, ya have to have a Bowel Movement. * So after the cream of wheat, toast, yogurt, I'm laying in bed and BOOM! EXCRUCIATING STOMACH pains! I mean worst thing I have felt. * 2 Nurses came running in, asked my wife questions and automatically said \"We need to get him up\"! * KEY POINT, It WILL BE SLOW BUT get your husband up and walking around - FAST. * Again, MY PERSPECTIVE ONLY, It felt VERY odd walking around with a catheter in place. This was one of my \"stress points\" throughout this thing. Ridiculous - Right?? * Get him walking fast. Gotta get that gas to work down. * Ok now better but still gotta do the BM at some point. * The time came and for me, it was stressful and awkward. I was in my own bathroom in my room BUT now had a catheter hanging out of me, painful gas and need to have a BM. * No to be crude but I passed the loudest gas followed by BM that was somewhat painful. * My catheter also felt odd. BUT I had never had a BM with a catheter before! * MAJOR relief that I passed gas and had a BM. Now I had some confidence on what my recovery would entail. * Released and went home Thursday. * Was at home for 2 weeks before Catheter was removed. * Learn all about the LEG bag during the day! * I thought the BIG DAY was surgery day. TO ME, the BIG day is the follow-up PSA day. * I received my follow-up PSA 7 weeks post surgery and UNDETECTABLE. THAT is the BIG DAY. So hopefully by the time you read this, your Husband is through surgery and in recovery. Keep us all informed and to me, NO QUESTION is odd, embarrassing or out of line. Godspeed!",
