      "Content": "You can review my history (story) in signature. A few weeks ago I had bone scan and abdominal CT scan - both came back negative for metastasis/growth. Of course the PSA number and the velocity of rise (since the Lupron cessation) is a concern. My doc suggested PET/CT F-18 Fluciclovine (Axumin) scan. (I go to Cleveland Clinic). Well, Anthem denied the scan after the peer-to-peer. So I don\u2019t know how much I can fight it, but my insurance guy and I will try. I\u2019m asymptotic - I think. Years of sports and the Army have taken their toll ... so what ache and pain is normal or not .. who knows at this point. Lol. I\u2019m researching the cost. I have no idea what the scan costs but trying to get info from Cleveland. My questions: A) anyone else have this scan? Anyone\u2019s thoughts? B) if I don\u2019t do the scan or scan comes back neagative, what should I do? Continued PSA maybe monthly? Bone and CT scan monthly? I know my age, and the ridiculous PSA/Gleason numbers point towards the crap side of the bell curve. My doc said he reviewed the stats on 2,000 cases and found 20 that were close to mine. But this is the 4th time in my life the doctors have either said, \u201cit\u2019s in God\u2019s hands\u201d or \u201cget your affairs together\u201d. (Cleveland has not said this though) Different illnesses/maladies. Not cancer. But I beat em all. So ... at least it\u2019s not my first rodeo ... This whole ordeal is a trip. It\u2019s now like - well .... let\u2019s just see what happens. Lol. The doc is wonderful and good, Cleveland is great. I\u2019ve spent hours with people there (and my own research ... I\u2019m not in the medical field but been around it my whole life and am an engineer) and PC just seems to be a mother when it comes to progression and foresight. Depending on cost of scan (if anyone knows ballpark cost please let me know) I will do it. But any advice would be great. I\u2019ve learned to always listen to others. With Cleveland, we are waiting to see if I can get anywhere with insurance. Next week we speak to game plan with scan or no scan. So any input here would be awesome. Thank you very much and bless you all. And thanks for this resource.",

I'm no expert either, but a few questions: An abdominal CT can usually visualize the top part of the pelvis, but are you sure you didn't have a pelvic CT also? Or even a chest, abdomen, and pelvis? Sorry. Yes on pelvis and abdomen. I am not sure but I don\u0092t think the chest. I will confirm would make sense to do chest Do you remember how many lymph nodes were removed during your surgery? 2 closest to the prostate Why wasn't the Lupron restarted when your PSA began its last rise? Or some other form of HT? What has your doc said about treatment options going forward? Thanks for your help and response. Moving forward he said let\u0092s do the fancy test first. We debated the Lupron back in June but testosterone was really low. If we don\u0092t do another test we probably start Lupron again. Arggg lol. He did say in \u0093normal cases \u0093 like PSAs in high single or mid-range single (at diagnosis) he would but starting so high it\u0092s somewhat of an anomaly. I know. Numbers for PSA and Gleason are ridiculous. Lol. Researching on here and other studies, etc I don\u0092t find too many as high as mine got. I\u0092ve got call with them this week. Hoping to gather more insight here to ask them. They see so many cases etc there that they\u0092re exposed to more situations ... but ... damn, I tell people who understand these numbers and I get that look ... lol. Thanks for help !",

The PA said he will work this week to figure out this testing and insurance crap. Actually went through this with Anthem and the beam radiation and in the end they did it.

      "Content": "You can review my history (story) in signature. A few weeks ago I had bone scan and abdominal CT scan - both came back negative for metastasis/growth. Of course the PSA number and the velocity of rise (since the Lupron cessation) is a concern. My doc suggested PET/CT F-18 Fluciclovine (Axumin) scan. (I go to Cleveland Clinic). Well, Anthem denied the scan after the peer-to-peer. So I don\u2019t know how much I can fight it, but my insurance guy and I will try. I\u2019m asymptotic - I think. Years of sports and the Army have taken their toll ... so what ache and pain is normal or not .. who knows at this point. Lol. I\u2019m researching the cost. I have no idea what the scan costs but trying to get info from Cleveland. My questions: A) anyone else have this scan? Anyone\u2019s thoughts? B) if I don\u2019t do the scan or scan comes back neagative, what should I do? Continued PSA maybe monthly? Bone and CT scan monthly? I know my age, and the ridiculous PSA/Gleason numbers point towards the crap side of the bell curve. My doc said he reviewed the stats on 2,000 cases and found 20 that were close to mine. But this is the 4th time in my life the doctors have either said, \u201cit\u2019s in God\u2019s hands\u201d or \u201cget your affairs together\u201d. (Cleveland has not said this though) Different illnesses/maladies. Not cancer. But I beat em all. So ... at least it\u2019s not my first rodeo ... This whole ordeal is a trip. It\u2019s now like - well .... let\u2019s just see what happens. Lol. The doc is wonderful and good, Cleveland is great. I\u2019ve spent hours with people there (and my own research ... I\u2019m not in the medical field but been around it my whole life and am an engineer) and PC just seems to be a mother when it comes to progression and foresight. Depending on cost of scan (if anyone knows ballpark cost please let me know) I will do it. But any advice would be great. I\u2019ve learned to always listen to others. With Cleveland, we are waiting to see if I can get anywhere with insurance. Next week we speak to game plan with scan or no scan. So any input here would be awesome. Thank you very much and bless you all. And thanks for this resource.",

      "Content": "I just got off an email with the PA. Lol. To your points Michael (and Djin) - he said almost exactly what you just said. About pinpointing and new treatments. He added that starting the Lupron again now immediately can actually mess up the tests. I will look into these other tests as well. The PA said he will work this week to figure out this testing and insurance crap. Actually went through this with Anthem and the beam radiation and in the end they did it. Just typical bureaucratic dance. Lol Thanks again!",

      "Content": "You can review my history (story) in signature. A few weeks ago I had bone scan and abdominal CT scan - both came back negative for metastasis/growth. Of course the PSA number and the velocity of rise (since the Lupron cessation) is a concern. My doc suggested PET/CT F-18 Fluciclovine (Axumin) scan. (I go to Cleveland Clinic). Well, Anthem denied the scan after the peer-to-peer. So I don\u2019t know how much I can fight it, but my insurance guy and I will try. I\u2019m asymptotic - I think. Years of sports and the Army have taken their toll ... so what ache and pain is normal or not .. who knows at this point. Lol. I\u2019m researching the cost. I have no idea what the scan costs but trying to get info from Cleveland. My questions: A) anyone else have this scan? Anyone\u2019s thoughts? B) if I don\u2019t do the scan or scan comes back neagative, what should I do? Continued PSA maybe monthly? Bone and CT scan monthly? I know my age, and the ridiculous PSA/Gleason numbers point towards the crap side of the bell curve. My doc said he reviewed the stats on 2,000 cases and found 20 that were close to mine. But this is the 4th time in my life the doctors have either said, \u201cit\u2019s in God\u2019s hands\u201d or \u201cget your affairs together\u201d. (Cleveland has not said this though) Different illnesses/maladies. Not cancer. But I beat em all. So ... at least it\u2019s not my first rodeo ... This whole ordeal is a trip. It\u2019s now like - well .... let\u2019s just see what happens. Lol. The doc is wonderful and good, Cleveland is great. I\u2019ve spent hours with people there (and my own research ... I\u2019m not in the medical field but been around it my whole life and am an engineer) and PC just seems to be a mother when it comes to progression and foresight. Depending on cost of scan (if anyone knows ballpark cost please let me know) I will do it. But any advice would be great. I\u2019ve learned to always listen to others. With Cleveland, we are waiting to see if I can get anywhere with insurance. Next week we speak to game plan with scan or no scan. So any input here would be awesome. Thank you very much and bless you all. And thanks for this resource.",

Sorry. Yes on pelvis and abdomen. I am not sure but I don\u0092t think the chest. I will confirm would make sense to do chest Do you remember how many lymph nodes were removed during your surgery? 2 closest to the prostate Why wasn't the Lupron restarted when your PSA began its last rise? Or some other form of HT? What has your doc said about treatment options going forward? Thanks for your help and response. Moving forward he said let\u0092s do the fancy test first. We debated the Lupron back in June but testosterone was really low. If we don\u0092t do another test we probably start Lupron again. Arggg lol. He did say in \u0093normal cases \u0093 like PSAs in high single or mid-range single (at diagnosis) he would but starting so high it\u0092s somewhat of an anomaly. I know. Numbers for PSA and Gleason are ridiculous. Lol. Researching on here and other studies, etc I don\u0092t find too many as high as mine got. I\u0092ve got call with them this week.

They see so many cases etc there that they\u0092re exposed to more situations ... but ... damn, I tell people who understand these numbers and I get that look ... lol. Thanks for help !",
