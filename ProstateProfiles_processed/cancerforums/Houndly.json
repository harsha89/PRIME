I also have a cancer survivor colleague at work, who's been very supportive and helpful. If I go with Johns Hopkins, is it still good to find a local urologist, or is an oncologist better?

      "Content": "Thanks for the suggestions. I've been thinking about Johns Hopkins, but I really wanted some other opinions. I'm 54. In October I had a PHI test done as a follow up to the PSA tests. Here are the results: PSA Total: 8.4 (on 9/19/ it was 7.6, DRE normal) PSA Free: 1.03 pro2PSA: 14.79 % Free PSA: 12 Prostate Health Index (PHI): 41.6 The biopsy numbers, from Feb., what I was given, anyway, are: 16 cores: Left lat apex: Gleason 3+3=6, 10% of specimen Left lat mid: Atypical small acinar proliferation, suspicious Left medial base: Gleason 3+3=6, 10% of specimen The rest benign. Biopsy was done by Bostwick (which is out of my network, without being told it would be done with them, so I'm working on them to get at least some of the $3K+ paid anyway- no help at all from my urology practice). A second Urologist who looked at the numbers noted that it's very low risk with almost no metastatic potential. He suggested besides the surgery option that I consider active surveillance. I did have a bone scan, abdominal/pelvic CT scan with contrast, and chest x-ray, all of which were clean. I had an appendectomy a couple of years ago, which revealed some carcinoids there, and that's what got me thinking, then the rising PSA numbers. In the last six months I've also done a colonoscopy (clean except for hemorrhoids), kidney ultrasound (I had a kidney stone recently) and an upper endoscopy (some issues there, but not related to cancer). Prostate is enlarged some also, but not to the point of giving me much problem urinating- just not like my young days",
