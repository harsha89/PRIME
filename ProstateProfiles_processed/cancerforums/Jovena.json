I have tried Cialis and Viagra and they dont help.... leak badly. All I hear from the DR is that it just takes time. .. At times I just want to beat my head against the wall. Any thoughts guys? Sorry to hear about your bad experiences. ED and incontinence may last up to a year (or more) for DaVinci (with nerves sparing). Takes time for both to recover. If leakages really bad/unacceptable; You may wish to wish to consider installations of an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS):https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifi...nary_sphincter. To be considered as a last resort as surgery is required. Wishing you all the best. Jovena",

My father will also be starting his 6 rounds (3 weekly) of Docetaxel next week, together with Lupron. Only complain of low back pain on Lupron. Gabapentin helps in reducing bone, muscle, nerve pains; also preventing hot flashes with great sleeps. Suggests you discuss with your MO for reducing side effects. Understand that hair loss, red/white blood cells dropped, peripheral nerve pains (fingers/toes etc), mouth ulcers etc are additional side effects. Should avoid sick people/crowded places as immunity will be very low in the second week after chemo. Try to exercise in the 3rd week (walking, stretching exercises etc). Take plenty of fruits, vegetables. Just wondering how you are getting on. Hope you are coping well. Appreciate your update. Best wishes. Jovena",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by po18guy Lupron and Bicalutamide are not chemotherapy drugs. If I understand correctly (I'm a lymphoma guy), they are hormone antagonists, which have the ultimate effect of reducing the production of hormones which facilitate prostate cancer growth. .... As to chemotherapy worries, I was 10 years younger than your dad, but I received maximum doses of eight chemotherapy drugs in four months. I went on to receive 17 chemotherapy drugs total, and I am still alive, and happy to be so. ... Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome to the forum, Jovena AND Mary. Just dropping in to wish the best for both of your loved ones. Chuck Lupron (Lucrin) is an LHRH agonist. Initially it causes the testosterone to rise (10 to 20 days) after the first injection. Gradually the testosterone level goes down to its nadir or lowest level by 28 days after injection. Casodex (Bicalutamide) is an anti-androgen taken about 12 days before start of Lupron to reduce the (10 to 20 days) flare response. (An anti-androgen will stop testosterone from stimulating cancer cells.) Taxotere (Docetaxel ) is a chemotherapy drug. My dad is using all the generics (in brackets). Thanks for the feedback and good wishes. Originally Posted by maryanddan Sorry to hear about your dad. My husband had his first chemo treatment two weeks ago. He has had very few side effects from the chemo or the radiation and hormone therapy he's had in the past couple months. ... They seem to have manipulated the Taxotere to make it more tolerable. I've read that chemo can help with the pain from bone mets too if that's an issue. Good luck to you and your dad. Sorry to hear about your hubby. Happy for you that he is doing well with few side effects. Appreciate if you can advise: 1) Will he be taking 6 courses of Taxotere (3 weekly interval) ? 2) Is his Lupron injections supposed to be every 3 months ? 2nd injection is suppose to be on 6/10/16. No more Lupron ? Our oncologist is recommending Lupron injections every 3 months (for life) with 6 courses of chemo (Taxotere) now. The chemo must start before the second Lupron injection on 8/16/16 to get full benefits (Chaarted Trial). My dad is already \"struggling\" with his \"Total Androgen Blockage\" (Casodex & Lupron) plus back pain (also taking Gabapentin). Not keen at all to take on more toxic loads. Very nice of you to feedback. Kindly keep us further updated. Wishing your dad all the best.",

If I understand correctly (I'm a lymphoma guy), they are hormone antagonists, which have the ultimate effect of reducing the production of hormones which facilitate prostate cancer growth. .... As to chemotherapy worries, I was 10 years younger than your dad, but I received maximum doses of eight chemotherapy drugs in four months. I went on to receive 17 chemotherapy drugs total, and I am still alive, and happy to be so. ... Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome to the forum, Jovena AND Mary. Just dropping in to wish the best for both of your loved ones. Chuck Lupron (Lucrin) is an LHRH agonist. Initially it causes the testosterone to rise (10 to 20 days) after the first injection. Gradually the testosterone level goes down to its nadir or lowest level by 28 days after injection. Casodex (Bicalutamide) is an anti-androgen taken about 12 days before start of Lupron to reduce the (10 to 20 days) flare response. (An anti-androgen will stop testosterone from stimulating cancer cells.) Taxotere (Docetaxel ) is a chemotherapy drug. My dad is using all the generics (in brackets).

I've read that chemo can help with the pain from bone mets too if that's an issue. Good luck to you and your dad. Sorry to hear about your hubby. Happy for you that he is doing well with few side effects. Appreciate if you can advise: 1) Will he be taking 6 courses of Taxotere (3 weekly interval) ? 2) Is his Lupron injections supposed to be every 3 months ? 2nd injection is suppose to be on 6/10/16. No more Lupron ? Our oncologist is recommending Lupron injections every 3 months (for life) with 6 courses of chemo (Taxotere) now. The chemo must start before the second Lupron injection on 8/16/16 to get full benefits (Chaarted Trial). My dad is already \"struggling\" with his \"Total Androgen Blockage\" (Casodex & Lupron) plus back pain (also taking Gabapentin). Not keen at all to take on more toxic loads. Very nice of you to feedback. Kindly keep us further updated. Wishing your dad all the best.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by po18guy Lupron and Bicalutamide are not chemotherapy drugs. If I understand correctly (I'm a lymphoma guy), they are hormone antagonists, which have the ultimate effect of reducing the production of hormones which facilitate prostate cancer growth. .... As to chemotherapy worries, I was 10 years younger than your dad, but I received maximum doses of eight chemotherapy drugs in four months. I went on to receive 17 chemotherapy drugs total, and I am still alive, and happy to be so. ... Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome to the forum, Jovena AND Mary. Just dropping in to wish the best for both of your loved ones. Chuck Lupron (Lucrin) is an LHRH agonist. Initially it causes the testosterone to rise (10 to 20 days) after the first injection. Gradually the testosterone level goes down to its nadir or lowest level by 28 days after injection. Casodex (Bicalutamide) is an anti-androgen taken about 12 days before start of Lupron to reduce the (10 to 20 days) flare response. (An anti-androgen will stop testosterone from stimulating cancer cells.) Taxotere (Docetaxel ) is a chemotherapy drug. My dad is using all the generics (in brackets). Thanks for the feedback and good wishes. Originally Posted by maryanddan Sorry to hear about your dad. My husband had his first chemo treatment two weeks ago. He has had very few side effects from the chemo or the radiation and hormone therapy he's had in the past couple months. ... They seem to have manipulated the Taxotere to make it more tolerable. I've read that chemo can help with the pain from bone mets too if that's an issue. Good luck to you and your dad. Sorry to hear about your hubby. Happy for you that he is doing well with few side effects. Appreciate if you can advise: 1) Will he be taking 6 courses of Taxotere (3 weekly interval) ? 2) Is his Lupron injections supposed to be every 3 months ? 2nd injection is suppose to be on 6/10/16. No more Lupron ? Our oncologist is recommending Lupron injections every 3 months (for life) with 6 courses of chemo (Taxotere) now. The chemo must start before the second Lupron injection on 8/16/16 to get full benefits (Chaarted Trial). My dad is already \"struggling\" with his \"Total Androgen Blockage\" (Casodex & Lupron) plus back pain (also taking Gabapentin). Not keen at all to take on more toxic loads. Very nice of you to feedback. Kindly keep us further updated. Wishing your dad all the best.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by WaterUnderTheBridge It's possible your insurance company might cover Jevtana after an initial treatment of Taxotere, after which the doctor contacts the insurance company to say the patient is not tolerating Taxotere and needs Jevtana. It's an approach worth asking about. It is not unusual. I am on Eligard (like Lupron, but at 6 month intervals) but take Bicalutamide as well. I will say a prayer for your dad--and for you. And I wish you the best as well! Many thanks for being so nice and comforting. Also wish you all the best too. Jovena",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by WaterUnderTheBridge I was slated to have Taxotere, .. insurance company .. approve the more expensive drug, Jevtana. I've had 5 of 6 treatments, and I haven't had hair loss, nausea, mouth sores, or extremity nerve pain. If there is any way he can have Jevtana instead of Taxotere, it might be much easier on him. I am puzzled by why he would only take bicalutamide for 21 days. I'd expect him to have to take it until it stops working. Jevtana (http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/sa..._cancer_357147) is very expensive, not covered by our insurance. My oncologist is recommending: 1) Lupron (3 monthly injections for life) plus 6 courses of Taxotere (3 weekly interval) now as per Chaarted Trial: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056...3747#t=article ; or else 2) Lupron (3 monthly injections) plus Bicalutamide (daily) for life: Total Androgen Blockage (TAB) Very grateful to you for your feedback. Great that you have completed 5 courses of Jevtana with minimal side effects. Very happy for you. Wishing you all the best. Jovena",
