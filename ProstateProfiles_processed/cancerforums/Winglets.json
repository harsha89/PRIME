      "Content": "Hi, thanks for your responses. I meant the GP. I need to go through the GP to request an urologist appointment. Only they can refer us if they feel it's necessary. I'm thinking maybe it's the medication but then I've stopped it now for the last 3 days and I am aware that there are withdrawal symptoms with this medication as well. Even so I'm still having this unusual urination pattern. For example yesterday I drank plenty, maybe well over 3-4l but had no urge to go for most of the day apart from in the morning. In total I went maybe around 3/4 times which is normal for me. Today however, I've already been twice within 2 hours and voided around 1 litre despite the fact that I've only drunk about 500ml before my first void. So this makes no sense to me and is what slightly concerns me because it's not normal for me. Again though no pain, burning or straining, no other real obvious symptoms etc. I thought if it were prostate related, would it not present with more obvious, physical symptoms like more frequent urges, burning, straining, poor flow etc. and it would be progressive and consistent, not like on and off?",

      "Content": "I'm 34 and for almost 2 months I've been having this slight sensation that I want to pee however it's not consistent or regular. It started when I was waking up every night around 3/4am with that slight sensation. Last week or so I've been sleeping better at night time until last night when I felt the sensation again to pee and a reasonable amount came out when I went twice. I wake up with the feeling too but soon disappears as I get up out of bed. I'll have three or more days maybe where I'm totally fine, normal urination, no urge etc. then suddenly the next day I'll have this bout where I'll go a few times in succession, like twice in 2 hours. During this time my pee is clear, almost white colour but what's bothering me is why this is happening randomly. I haven't changed my diet or fluid intake. Still no pain or burning or anything severe before or after peeing. Maybe it is what it is but it's not really normal for me. Usually I'll only need to pee about 2-3 times for the entire day! The only other slight and again mild symptom is that I feel an urge straight after showering even though I just peed whilst showering, even that though comes and goes. Also I have a slightly dry, out during the night which is better by the morning. The doctor has no idea about this. I've been to three different doctors. It's not high blood sugar as I checked my bs during one of these bouts and it was normal. It could be the mirtazapine / remeron I'm on (15mg) but this is not a known side effect. It's not an infection or uti as 4 urinalysis have come back negative each time. Doctor not concerned about prostate issues, firstly due to my age and secondly because I'm not having any prostate related symptoms but I'm not sure now. Can someone under 40 have prostate issues? So have no idea what to do apart from going back to doctor and requesting an urologist apt. God knows how long that will take. The only thing I could attribute it to is the remeron / mirtazapine but if these are side effects from that then I wasn't getting them when I started it 2 months ago.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider A \"slightly enlarged\" prostate is nothing, I wouldn't worry so much. As a man gets older and older, his prostate gets bigger and bigger. A 20 year old man has a prostate the size of a walnut, by the time he is 40 its the size of a golf ball, it becomes the size of a lemon when he reaches 60, and the size of a softball at age 80. That's your future, I wouldn't worry about it. There is a connection between self-abuse and the PSA test, you just want to avoid it for 3 days before the blood test as it does push up the score temporarily. But it doesn't have ill effects nor does it cause BPH or prostate cancer. Yeah I guess it\u2019s still a little un-nerving to know that I might have an enlarged prostate. This is not something a person my age is meant to get, apparently. So I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m upset. Also if it is on the large side now, then it might well be huge by the time I get to 50 or so.",

      "Content": "I'm 34, male and for more than 2 months now I've been experiencing some strange, vague symptoms which are actually hard to describe as there is no pain or anything severe physically. It's like a slight sensation of fullness with a very slight urge to pee which is more prominent at night and can disturb my sleep. I wake up around 3/4 am on and off for these 2 months with that slight sensation. Sometimes it makes me want to pee but most of the time I don't need to go so I don't, so it's not really that severe. Occasionally I'll end up having an urge to pee and some days I have voided a bit more than other days despite not changing my drinking habits. I've never had pain or burning or straining when peeing and there's no pain whatsoever anywhere else. I've had urianalysis samples done 4 times, all normal, tested my blood glucose level several times using home testing kits before/after meals and that's normal too. I then finally had a DRE and to my surprise, the doctor said it was slightly enlarged however it was very smooth and normal in that regard. It shocked me because I didn't expect someone my age to have this but the doctor wasn't overly concerned about it and said it's not abnormal and this can happen and it's nothing hugely to worry about. Nevertheless it's got me really anxious now. He gave me a PSA form so I'm going to go and get that done. I realise that prostate enlargement is a benign condition and there is no link to cancer but I don't know, I'm a little worried. Am I right in thinking that the smoothness and surface/texture of the prostate is more important than the actual size? He thinks that my symptoms are more likely due to a slight over-active bladder than anything else. I should also mention in relation to the enlarged prostate and a reason why possibly it could be in my case is that I have mas-bing on average once a day since I was around 13/14 years of age. Now that is quite alot of mas-bion and I know this has a connection with your prostate right? Is there any connection with prostate enlargement and m? Also on the morning of the DRE I had mastb'd about an hour/1.5 hours before it so I don't know if that too had an effect.",

That's your future, I wouldn't worry about it. There is a connection between self-abuse and the PSA test, you just want to avoid it for 3 days before the blood test as it does push up the score temporarily.

This is not something a person my age is meant to get, apparently. So I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m upset.
