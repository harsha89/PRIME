After my annual physical and my lab results back received a cll from my primary doctor requesting to go for another visit .

The doctor give me a round of antibiotics and I was scheduled for another visit and a new lab work . PSA test comes elevated once again and a third one. After my last PSA test results the doctor decided to proceed with the cystoscopy and the biopsy at the same time. Results posted below. He recommended complete removal of the prostate.
