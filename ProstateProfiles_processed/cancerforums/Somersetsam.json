      "Content": "Hi to all, I am new to the forum, received a positive diagnosis from a 14 sample biopsy in July 2017. My results are as follows; T1c 7 of 14 samples tested positive Right Base- 3+4 (Pattern 4 5%), involving 2 of 2 cores (10.5 mm 90%; 11 mm 80%) Right Mid- 3+4 (Pattern 4 5%), involving 2 of 2 cores (10.5 mm 83%; 11 mm 90%) Right Apex- 4+3 involving 1 of 2 cores (1 mm 7%) Left Mid- 4+3 involving 1 of 2 cores (1.2 mm 12%) Left Apex- 3+3 involving 1 of 3 cores (1.2 10%) Prostate size 26 grams Last 3 PSA's: 4.2 04/13/2016, 5.4 03/23/2017, 7.2 04/24/2017 I am 63 years old I have met with 2 urologists, and am really leaning towards surgery. My wife and I met with the surgeon that would do my robotic procedure, and he would like to do the surgery soon. Here's where it gets complicated. The surgeon's first opening is October 2, and my son is getting married on September 30, in a town 800 miles from our home. While we could change all our plans it would be difficult. The surgeon's next opening is October 24, but he was really suggesting I try to make the October 2 surgery. I know that nothing is written in stone, but my question is could the 3 weeks between the first and second surgery date really make a difference? If I have the surgery on Oct.2, I will need to tell all my family members prior to the wedding, and I did not want to do this. However, I would like to be around to enjoy my family for as long as possible. Any input will be much appreciated! Kevin",
