      "Content": "Hi, Hoping someone can give me their advice. I was diagnosed about 5 to 6 years ago with prostate cancer. I had the surgery. The cancer came back, so I underwent radiation. It came back a third time. I have been watching the PSA increase for around 1 1/2 yrs. Last January my PSA was at .02. By last August it had reached 4.0. Then in Nov it was at 18.1. The January 2019 test from last week shows my PSA at 71. I also went for CAT and Bone scans this past December. Test showed that the cancer has spread to my lymph nodes and to most of my bones (thighs, arms, shoulders, and spine). I went to Cancer Care Manitoba this past Monday and they want to put me on ADT along with Chemo. They said that I could live many more years if I agreed to this (my GP had said I had 1 year). I am having an issue with this as I do not want to go through all the side effects. It used to be that ADT would give you an additional 2 yrs, but they are now saying that I might live another 10 years. Does this sound right? I have come to the point where I might agree to try it for 1 yr and see where I am at. Any comments or advice would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Bruce Henderson.",

I had a file with all the info you mentioned, but I lost everything this past Aug, when an apartment fire burned down my building and I lost everything. I appreciate your comments about the new advances currently seen and I think your right that the future could bring more advances. I guess what concerns me is that the cancer has spread to lymph nodes and bones already. Can this treatment reverse that? I am also wondering how other members were able to handle all the side effects from the Hormone replacement therapy. Worried that while I may live longer, the quality of life will be negatively impacted. Thanks, Bruce",
