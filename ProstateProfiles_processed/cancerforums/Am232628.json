      "Content": "Dear Chuck Many thanks for telling me the book. I will order immediately to study. He is 71 and he did have previous PSA values and recently did some rectum related test, so I guess it is the procedure you mentioned. Now I know what info to ask for and will share more. The last PSA test score of 10, was taken immediately after our romantic weekend getaway. He did not realize that he should not do the test immediately. After subsequent research, I mentioned that the score could be affected and he should mention it to his doctor. In Asia, men at the golden age, often are reluctant to mention they have sexual needs and activities. They would often be judged as inappropriate individuals, especially by the younger generation, like one's children. Often men would not want to mention their medical conditions to their family, as they fear it would cause worries and fears. So I will try to find a way to get the info without being too investigative. Will get back soon. Many thanks Chuck. The info is fantastic! Best, A",

My boyfriend informed me on new year day that he went for a scan after receiving a PSA score of 10. Doctor recommend he should have an operation. We live in Asia, and I feel our doctors often do not explain well or forgot we have rights to information. He told me some side effects to expect after the operation, which sounded scary. We both are new to this topic. I also know no one who has the knowledge or courage to share. I am feeling very confused, worried and stressed over the unknown. Will you be kind enough to share first of all what information, tests, or medical procedures to ask the doctor? I felt my boyfriend might not like to ask for help and his adult children who are not living with him ( he lost his wife a few years ago) would not be able to help him. How to provide care and emotional support without sounding too nosy. I am also very keen to know how to be a good partner to support him emotionally, he seemed rather concern of the possibility of end of sex life, meaning an end to our relationship. I look forward to your advice, it's so hard to speak or learn about these topics in Asia. Best wishes to all in the new year, A",
