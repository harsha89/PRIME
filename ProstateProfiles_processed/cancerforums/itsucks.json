      "Content": "Hi all, I'm new here and I registered this account for my dad (61 years old). My dad recently got some blood test and MRI done. He has fear for biopsy and he doesn't have insurance in the U.S. Would really appreciate some feedback and comments on his results from other members on this forum. Do you guys think this is likely prostate cancer? Is a biopsy absolutely necessary at this stage? Thank you all so much! He got his tests done at a non-English speaking country. So I tried my best to translate them into English here: Blood Test Results: FRT: 49.7 ng/ml Normal range: 23.9-336.2 AFP: 5.58 ng/ml Normal range: 0-10 CEA: 1.29 ng/ml Normal range: 0-5 CA125: 4.8 IU/ml Normal range: 0-35 CA153: 5.4 IU/ml Normal range: 0-35 CA199: 6.3 IU/ml Normal range: 0-37 TPSA: 4.93 ng/ml Normal range: 0-4 FPSA: 0.55 ng/ml Normal range: 0-1 FPSA/TPSA: 0.11 Normal range: >0.25 MRI Results: Bladder filling looks fine. The inner wall of the bladder does not look very smooth. Enlarged prostate, mainly enlarged median lobe, is identified. The median lobe shows multi-nodular. The trigone of bladder is clear. Does not observe fluid in the pelvis. Does not observe swollen enlarged lymph nodes. Impression: Prostatic hyperplasia accompanied by median lobe multi-nodular. Suggests biopsy.",
