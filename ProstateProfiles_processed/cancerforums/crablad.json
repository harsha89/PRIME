I am very glad to see the numbers drop but does this mean they will go back up faster as well and the cells become resistant? I have so many questions just not sure where to start?? My husband was diagnosed at the age of 54 PSA 44, he is now 72 and his PSA is 30. We have had it go up and down, up and down. He has had probably every type of meds available plus three clinical trials. When his PSA went to 187 he started chemo with taxotere which worked great, some side effects. He is now on Xtandi...we will see how that goes. He is still strong and works hard...so there are lots of options...just find a good oncologist.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by hollienbilly My name is Hollie and my husband (45) was diagnosed with prostate cancer on 1/14/14. He has no signs or symptoms of the cancer. They started him on hormone therapy and after 6 weeks his psa fell to 139 and then after another 6 weeks it is down to 39. I am very glad to see the numbers drop but does this mean they will go back up faster as well and the cells become resistant? I have so many questions just not sure where to start?? My husband was diagnosed at the age of 54 PSA 44, he is now 72 and his PSA is 30. We have had it go up and down, up and down. He has had probably every type of meds available plus three clinical trials. When his PSA went to 187 he started chemo with taxotere which worked great, some side effects. He is now on Xtandi...we will see how that goes. He is still strong and works hard...so there are lots of options...just find a good oncologist.",
