      "Content": "Hi and thanks for my addition to the forum. I've been diagnosed with urethral carcinoma in situ in my bladder. Several cystos and CT and IVP scans have revealed no tumors. But I did have elevated PSA levels, a 5. So my urologists wants to do a ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. It's going to happen in about three weeks. I just was asking if any forum members have had this procedure and if so what should I expect as far as pain, discomfort and recovery times. Thanks and if this topic is more appropriate at a different forum could you please direct me there. Thanks again. Joe",

      "Content": "Hi, Thanks for the feed back. The biopsy after my TURP indicated CIS but it may be from the bladder. I'm still getting urgency to urinate frequently sometimes every hour and like four times during the night. I bit uncomfortable when I urinate. I'm thinking maybe with BCG maintenance I may be able to live with the discomfort. The prostate is a different issue. So I guess I'll have to see what the Ultrasound biopsy reveals and go from there. I do have a consultation with the urologist a week after the biopsy. I'll know more then. The good thing about all of this is my girlfriend has been very supportive which means so much to me.",

Back then I started experiencing discomfort during urination and frequent trips to the bathroom. This happened sporadically. This kept occurring frequently. I went to my GP and tested my urine which checked out to be normal. Urine was clear with minor evidence of blood but no indication of anything remarkable. Did several rounds of antibiotics which did nothing. Took saw palmetto, pumpkin seed oil, probiotic and other supplements, nothing relived the symptoms. Finally referred to a urologist. He tried the antibiotic routine plus Oxybutinin and Flomax generic. No relief. The urologist diagnosed me with prostatitis. I went to a second urologist. He basically did the same things. What he did do was insert a scope into my bladder to look for tumors. He found none, but he sent the fluid in my bladder to check for carcinoma. The biopsy was positive but he had to determine where the carcinoma cells were coming from, kidneys, bladder or prostate. He did a cystoscopy. The carcinoma was isolated in the bladder. He referred me to a specialist in Stanford Hospital. Stanford recommended a series of 6 BCG treatments followed up with a second cystoscopy. First set of BCG treatments were not successful so a second set of 3 BCG treatments. Not sure if the second set of BCG treatments were successful, waiting on the results. Urologist found elevated levels in PSA test. So this is where I am now. Ultrasound guided prostate biopsy scheduled in two weeks.

      "Content": "Hi, Thanks for the feed back. The biopsy after my TURP indicated CIS but it may be from the bladder. I'm still getting urgency to urinate frequently sometimes every hour and like four times during the night. I bit uncomfortable when I urinate. I'm thinking maybe with BCG maintenance I may be able to live with the discomfort. The prostate is a different issue. So I guess I'll have to see what the Ultrasound biopsy reveals and go from there. I do have a consultation with the urologist a week after the biopsy. I'll know more then. The good thing about all of this is my girlfriend has been very supportive which means so much to me.",

      "Content": "Hi, My PSA is a 4 and my urologist wants to do a ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. I have been diagnosed with carcinoma in situ in my bladder and a digital rectal exam revealed a bump on my prostate about a month ago. Did a series of 6 BCG treatments and a follow-up of 3 BCG treatments 2 months ago. Also had a TURP and cytology 3 months ago. So I'm wondering if a ultrasound guided prostate biopsy is necessary at this time or is the safe to wait to see if the PSA levels are reduced. Thanks Joe",
