      "Content": "Dave, You might want to consider having a 3T MRI and see what the results are or even a MRI guided biopsy. The MRI guided biopsy are much more accurate then a standard TRUS. At Sloan Kettering they are now doing MRI's before any biopsy. The biopsy would only be done if the results of the MRI warrant it. Let us know the results of your 2nd biopsy. If only one or two cores are found, Gleason 6 you might want to consider Active Surveillance. Best of luck to you.",

I decided on radiation (IMRT). Luckily I changed my mind last minute and boy am I glad. Over the last 2 years I have monitored my PSA and had two MRI's. Just this week I had a MRI guided biopsy which takes a biopsy sample from the suspicious tumor. This increases the accuracy of the biopsy, no guessing if they missed a higher grade cancer. I bring this up to point out you have to be your own advocate and educate yourself.",

Through my research and speaking with doctors I was informed that PCa is slow growing and I have plenty of time to decide on my treatment method. Johns Hopkins, Memorial Sloan Kettering and others are now informing PCa patients about over treatment for low grade cancer. These organizations are HIGHLY respected in the field of cancer research and I am trying not to be influenced by people on these forums who made there decision on fear and uncertainties. AS programs are very similar throughout the world, PSA and DRE every 3 months and a biopsy once a year. Under this program there is a very good chance of detecting if the cancer is growing and needs treatment. This is just my opinion. I recommend taking your time and do as much research as possible.",

My Dr. at Memorial Sloan Kettering only does MRI guided biopsy's. If you do a standard biopsy and nothing is found you'll be in the same boat. I think you need to find a Dr. who specializes in MRI guided biopsy's. Keep us posted and best of luck.",
