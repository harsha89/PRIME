      "Content": "Thanks so much for your response. The doctor intends to do a Turp after the radiation. Did you have a lot of pain with your BPH? He had been very healthy, and in fact, finally retired (for the last time) at 78. A year ago in August he had a stroke, and he has pretty much completely recovered from it, only to now have this new issue. I think we're all a little concerned about him tolerating surgery, but I don't think he will be able to tolerate a catheter for the rest of his life. I just feel really bad for him.",

      "Content": "My Dad has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Sorry, I don't know the Gleason score--my parents could not remember. However, I know that they think it is in the early stages and thought that he could either do watchful waiting or radiation. He decided to go with radiation. His prostate has been enlarged and he has been unable to urinate on his own for about 4 months. He is now getting radiation treatments every day, and uses a self-catheter for urination. He currently has a urinary tract infection, so he is on an anti-biotic. My big worry for him, is that he is in a lot of pain. The dr said that the pain was related to the infection and gave him a narcotic. The narcotic keeps the pain at bay for a while, but after a few days on it, he starts acting like he has dementia, (he is almost 81 and normally does not really appear to be his age.) Also, after a few days, even when taking the pain pills, he complains of terrible pain. He has never been good with taking any kind of drugs--they always seem to affect him more than most people. I haven't been able to find anything on the web related to prostate cancer and excessive pain problems. I don't think that the cancer has spread to his bones, because they did a bone scan and it seemed to be fine. I'm just not sure how to help him. He is really having a hard time making it through each day. My Mom is stressed and worried about him as well, as she tries to take care of him. Has anyone else experienced this, and what have you done to relieve the pain?",
