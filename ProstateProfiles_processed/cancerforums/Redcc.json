      "Content": "My dad was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer in February 2012 (my mum with BC a month later). The cancer had spread to his back andwas too far advanced for chemo. He has had hormone treatment and started new medication earlier this year abiraterone acetate, 4 tablets once a day and steroids. My dad attends Clatterbridge every 4 weeks, his PSA levels have steadily risen 70, 88, 98.7 and today 116. What can anyone tell me about these levels? And what to expect as it advances further thanks",

The meds he has now where the last chance and they don't seem to be slowing it down as his PSA levels have risen every month",
