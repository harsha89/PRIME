      "Content": "I figured I would check back in since I have not been online much lately. I've had 4 of my 6 chemotherapy treatments (Docetaxel) and they have been rough. I was hospitalized after the first treatment because my insurance company refused to allow me to receive Nuelasta after the treatment. I got so ill I had to be brought to the hospital and was admitted for 3 days. My WBC was in the danger zone as were my platelets so I was treated over the next three days and released. Each treatment has been brutal as far as getting sick and my body getting weak and pain levels increasing with each treatment. My insurance company began approving Neulasta after the second chemotherapy treatment as they were threatened with a lawsuit if they refused the shot a second time. I had a Eleguard shot days before my 4th treatment and it compounded the symptoms of fatigue, nausea and pain, that really made me feel at my lowest point. I have continued working in between chemotherapy treatments as I feel up to it. I usually feel good enough toward the end of the second week to go back to work for 6 or 7 days prior to the next treatment. I have two more treatments to go, July 28th and August 18th. I will then be scheduled for another CT Scan to check my lungs to see what the status is of the nodules. Over all the worst part of this is that my whole body feels really weak, I have no strength what so ever. My oncologist has informed me that I will be this way until all of the drugs are out of my system. However the good news is I am still here fighting and I know I have given myself every opportunity possible to battle the cancer and hopefully win the fight. I've had Da Vinci Surgery, 38 Radiation Treatments, 2 Lupron injections (6 month dose), 1 Eleguard injection (6 month dose) and 6 doses of Docetaxel when the chemo is complete. I will stay on Eleguard through 2017 with my last dose in December 2017. After that it is active surveillance and a lot of praying that the cancer does not come back. My last PSA came back as undetectable on June 29th so things are looking good so far.",

Currently the hormone therapy side effects have been brutal, I have bone, joint and muscle pain as well as nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hot flashes, chills and fatigue.

I ended up having my prostate, the seminal vesicle, a nerve bundle and 11 lymph nodes removed, after surgery I was informed of the positive margin. Since surgery on June 3rd 2015 I have had 3 hormone therapy shots with a 4th one scheduled for the end of December, I have also had 38 radiation treatments and 8 chemotherapy treatments. My current PSA level is undetectable. is the catheter a PIA? Absolutely, but you need to look at the big picture, long term survival. Do I have any regrets? I do not have any regrets and I am happy I made my own decisions because I feel removing as much cancer as possible gave me the best chance at long term survival.",

The swelling in my legs has gotten worse (during the wait for an appointment) and the pitting in my calves is pretty bad when I press on my legs with a finger. The pain is also bad, but I am controlling that with 2 Extra Strength Tylenol every 4 hours to stay ahead of the pain. Due to the medical expenses I have already paid for other medical treatments for my prostate cancer, these treatments will be covered at 100%, that includes the massages, wraps, compression clothing and compression pump to help make this condition more tolerable. The Lymphedema has put a big crimp in my lifestyle which is driving me crazy as I was always a very active person performing home improvement projects and maintaining my yard. I pray to God everyday to get my life back on track from this nasty side effect.",

      "Content": "Thank you for the warm welcome, it is nice to have other folks to speak to that are going through a similar experiences. I originally went to speak to my Urologist about erection problems in September 2014. I was given a prostate exam and a PSA test and my prostate was found to be enlarged and my PSA was a 4.1. My Urologist gave me a sample of Cialis and told me that he would like to see me again in 6 months (March 2015). When I went back to see my Urologist in March 2015 he ran another PSA test and it also came back as a 4.1 and I informed him that the Cialis did not help. At this point my Urologist set up a date for the biopsy in April 2015, the rest is explained above. After the surgery it was pretty scary to hear that the post-op biopsy revealed a much worse condition. Finding out that I was now a stage four cancer patient with metastatic disease had me real worried. Luckily my daughter graduated from the Duke School of Nursing and she is a Certified Pediatric Oncology Nurse at Children's Hospital in Washington, DC. She kept me focused and set my mind at ease over the last 7 months. She is my personal nurse and an angel, she has been and continues to oversee all of my medical care. On numerous occasions she has made recommendations of tests and procedures during this battle so I would receive nothing but the best care possible.",

Shortly after my chemotherapy I developed Lymphedema, swelling in both feet and legs. I had no idea I was at an increased risk by having lymph nodes removed and due to both radiation and chemotherapy. Lymphedema happens when you lymphatic system does not allow the lymphatic fluid to flow properly in your body, thus causing swelling in limbs and it can take up to 36 months to occur. From everything I have read, there is no cure for Lymphedema, just treatments. Unfortunately there is no way to determine what treatment caused mine. I have an appointment on November 7th to be evaluated and a plan put in place to fight this nasty side effect. From what I have read the plans include exercises, massages of the lymph nodes, compression pumps and compression clothing to reduce swelling, thus reducing the pain. Has anyone else developed Lymphedema? If so what are you doing to combat the swelling and pain?",

      "Content": "Hello all, I have been reading a lot of the posts and decided I might as well introduce myself. My name is Ron, I live in Northern Virginia and I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in April 2015. My first biopsy show 8 cores of 12 positive for cancer with a Gleason score of 7. I did some research and decided to have my prostate removed via the DaVinci Robotic Procedure. After the biopsy results were in I had a bone scan which turned out negative, an MRI with contrast which showed the cancer had broken through the prostate capsule and possibly had lympnode involvement. After I got the results I met with my Urologist Dr. John Klien and my Oncologist Dr. Joseph Lee to discuss my options. After meeting with both of them, they each recommended that I choose radiation because the odds of the surgery being successful was only 30%. My family and I met and discussed my options in great detail and I decided to stay with my original plan to have my prostate removed. When we discussed this with my Urologist he tried to push me to choosing radiation. I stood my ground and my Urologist finally agreed to perform the surgery but he wanted me to understand that I would need the salvage radiation treatments after surgery, I informed him that I fully understood this. Well my surgery took place on June 3rd and it went much longer than planned, the total surgery time was 7 1/2 hours and I almost needed a blood transfusion during surgery. After the surgery my Urologist came in to speak with my family and I and stated that the cancer had in fact engulfed one nerve bundle, the seminal vesicle and at least one lymphnode and that he removed the nerve bundle, the seminal vesicle and 11 lymphnodes. He further stated that he sent out a sample to pathology as soon as the surgery started and that those results showed a different picture. There was a positive margin just below the bladder and the post operation pathology came back with a Gleason scale of 9 and that one lymphnode tested positive for cancer Fast forward 30 days, I was placed on Lupron on July 3rd to help control the cancer. I have since been feeling the effects of the Lupron with hot flashes, chills, fatigue and loss of sex drive. My Urologist informed me that I had a maximum of four months to recover before the salvage radiation treatments would begin. I regained my continence during that time and that was a huge plus for me. My radiation treatments began in September, I was informed that there would be 38 treatments, today I receive treatment number 22. Unfortunately I have been dealing with side effects abdominal pain, increased fatigue and diarrhea from the radiation treatments. These side effects really are miserable but I just keep pushing forward knowing that I will be finished with the radiation treatments on November 12. My family and I will be celebrating on November 12th after my last treatment. I hope to be cancer free one day, God willing. I did meet with my Urologist before starting radiation treatments and asked him what he thought about the choices I made and he informed that after looking back on everything that the choices I made were in fact the best way to go, that made me feel good. Do I have any regrets about my choices? Absolutely not, I had as much of the cancer removed from my body as possible and I am attacking the cancer with a three step fight, surgery, hormone therapy and radiation treatments. Do I understand that there is a 80% to 90% chance of recurrence of the cancer? Yes I do and I will fight that battle if and when that happens.",

      "Content": "All, I watched two television shows and some videos online that mention Rick Simpson Canabis Oil. Dennis Hill a Bio-Chemist at MD Anderson Cancer Center had Prostate Cancer (Gleason - and it had metastisized. He mentions that he held off on traditional treatments (surgery, radiation and chemotherapy) to attempt using the canabis oil. He mentioned two receptors in the body CB1 and CB1 and an Antrogen receptor that the cannabis oil bonds with to attack cancer cells. Dennis Hill claims that within 6 months that the cancerous tumor was and the metatstatic lesions were cured. Is there any known truth to this cannabis oil actually attacking and killing cancer cells like they have stated? I performed a search on the Rick Simpson cannabis oil and it is only available to California residents due to drug laws and that a 30 day supply is $1,500.",

      "Content": "Previously, doctors have only been able to see prostate cancer, either as a tumor or at metastatic sites, when there have been enough cancer cells gathered together to make a critical mass that would show up on MRI or another form of imaging. There was no way to target prostate cancer cells specifically. Have any cancer cells escaped the prostate? This is the question that every man who has prostate cancer, and every doctor treating him, wants to answer. Now there's a way to find out without making an incision or taking another biopsy sample. It's a brand new technique, called PSMA imaging, and it uses a PET (for positron emission tomography) scanner. The technique was developed by Martin G. Pomper, M.D., Ph.D., the William R. Brody Professor of Radiology and Director of the Division of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, and the original support to develop it came from a grant made by Patrick C. Walsh Prostate Cancer Research Fund. \"This truly is individualized medicine, and we can really help patients with it,\" says Pomper; in fact, men with prostate cancer from around the world have flown to Johns Hopkins just to have this test done. \"The results from this new radiotracer have changed how the disease is being managed in some patients. It, and others like it being used in Europe, have caught on like wildfire.\" At medical meetings devoted to prostate cancer, sessions are now being taught on PSMA imaging. Here's why this is such a breakthrough: Previously, doctors have only been able to see prostate cancer, either as a tumor or at metastatic sites, when there have been enough cancer cells gathered together to make a critical mass that would show up on MRI or another form of imaging. There was no way to target prostate cancer cells specifically. But what if there could be a way to make those cells light up somehow? With this in mind, Pomper figured out a way to engineer a harmless radioactive tracer that would attach itself specifically to prostate cancer cells. The tracer targets something on the surface of these cells: a molecule called PSMA, for (prostate-specific membrane antigen). \"PSMA is a protein that is present in high concentrations on the surface of prostate cancer cells,\" Pomper says. \"PET is a sensitive imaging technique that can allow us to see tumors deep within the body. PET works by detecting the radioactive molecules we made to 'tag' the prostate cancer cells specifically.\" Previously in Discovery, we reported that Pomper had discovered and tested the first PSMA-targeting PET agent in a clinical trial. Now he has refined this \u0097 alphabet soup alert here \u0097 into a second-generation, PSMA-targeting PET agent called DCFPyL. Pomper is excited about the potential for DCFPyL to help men throughout the prostate cancer spectrum. \"This agent has vastly higher sensitivity and specificity, and it provides sharper images,\" he says. \"That will enable us to expand the use of imaging, not only to primary disease, but to see if the disease has returned after initial treatment, to help make treatment more accurate, and even as a monitoring tool for men on active surveillance. We believe that the images we are getting are the clearest ever obtained for prostate cancer in a human being.\" As a bonus, because PSMA is also expressed in the blood vessels of other types of cancers, this technique may also help spot other tumors, including certain forms of kidney cancer, he adds. Pomper and colleagues recently published their results in Molecular Imaging and Biology. http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/brady...cancer-imaging",

      "Sample": "My name is Ron, I live in Northern Virginia and I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in April 2015. My first biopsy show 8 cores of 12 positive for cancer with a Gleason score of 7. I did some research and decided to have my prostate removed via the DaVinci Robotic Procedure....Joseph Lee to discuss my options. After meeting with both of them, they each recommended that I choose radiation because the odds of the surgery being successful was only 30%....I ended up having my prostate, the seminal vesicle, a nerve bundle and 11 lymph nodes removed, after surgery I was informed of the positive margin. Since surgery on June 3rd 2015 I have had 3 hormone therapy shots with a 4th one scheduled for the end of December, I have also had 38 radiation treatments and 8 chemotherapy treatments....Jack, I had surgery and my Gleason was a 9. My Urologist wanted me to do radiation rather than surgery but I chose not to follow that advice....My first biopsy show 8 cores of 12 positive for cancer with a Gleason score of 7. I did some research and decided to have my prostate removed via the DaVinci Robotic Procedure. After the biopsy results were in I had a bone scan which turned out negative, an MRI with contrast which showed the cancer had broken through the prostate capsule and possibly had lympnode involvement....Jack, I had surgery and my Gleason was a 9. My Urologist wanted me to do radiation rather than surgery but I chose not to follow that advice. I ended up having my prostate, the seminal vesicle, a nerve bundle and 11 lymph nodes removed, after surgery I was informed of the positive margin....After meeting with both of them, they each recommended that I choose radiation because the odds of the surgery being successful was only 30%. My family and I met and discussed my options in great detail and I decided to stay with my original plan to have my prostate removed....I completed my 38 radiation treatments last week and had a PSA test and the results are in 0.00 We are celebrating the good news right now, however I will remain on Lupron for another 19 months as part of my original 3 tier treatment plan (Da Vinci Robotic Surgery, Hormone Therapy - Lupron and Radiation) as a precaution. I have also been told that I will being getting PSA tests every 3 months due to the fact I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer with metastatic disease (post surgery biopsy)....",
