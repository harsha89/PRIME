I went for a regular blood screen in May (vitamin/diet doctor) and my PSA came back at 17.7 from Quest diagnostics lab! I'm 58 years old and my father had prostate cancer in his mid 70s (successfully treated with proton therapy at Loma Linda). I made quick pace to a urologist. DRE was normal. Another PSA with his lab came back 24.6! Two weeks of antibiotics (levo), wait two weeks, another PSA came back 28.9! MRI ordered and no signs of anything spreading with just one spot of an \"indeterminate abnormality\". Biopsy is scheduled for August 14th. He'll take 16 samples, or \"until my wrist gets tired\" (my doc has a sense of humor). I'll let you guys know what's up...obviously could be a few different things.
