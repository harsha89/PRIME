      "Content": "His most rectn PSA is 30 and he is off treatment for last 2 months. CT scan recently showed paraaortic lymphnodes. No ther organ involvement. Bone scan scheduled next week. He does complain of back pain. Plain x-ray did show some \"osteoblastic\" activity. Oncologist also recommends Zytiga. But he does not have insurance. Can someone tell me if Johnson and Johnson patient assistance program is reliable? Are they currently accepting new applications? is there any coupon or drug discount card for this medication if we need to pay eventually? is it available in CVS,walgreens etc? or we need to order and wait for few days? many questions going on in my mind right now.....thanks for all your help.",

      "Content": "I am looking for some inputs about Zytiga. My father was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2010 and underwent orchiectomy. His PSA was then stable on casodex. Recently PSA went up and he now has enlarging pelvic lymph node and paraaortic lymphnodes. No other mets. His Gleason was 4+4 at diagnosis. Bone scan was negative in 2010. He also failed DES. He does not have insurance here in USA, nor he qualifies for medicare or medicaid since he does not have SS#. He does follow with urologist and oncologist here. We cannot afford to pay for this drug. My question is- what if he is rejected by Johnson and Johnson patient assistance program? I want to consider worse case scenario, and what if there is no help from local charity? Are there any other ways to get this drug atleast for cheap? please help us. Thank you in advance.",
