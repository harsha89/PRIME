I do walk every day, but just started doing Kegels this week, even though my doc said no special exercises, but he's away right now and I feel like I have to do something. One thing I have noticed recently, if I sit for a while and my bladder fills, it is less likely to leak when I stand up.(I'm tempted to drink non-stop, and keep my bladder full! lol ) Anybody else experienced this?

I'm not really one to sit and wait for stuff to happen, so, my question is, what are you guys doing to lessen the impact of urinary incontinence on your daily lives? Have you changed your diet?

      "Content": "Thanks MoHawk. Right now I am 5 weeks out of surgery, 3 weeks with catheter out, and my incontinence hasn't improved at all. I do walk every day, but just started doing Kegels this week, even though my doc said no special exercises, but he's away right now and I feel like I have to do something. One thing I have noticed recently, if I sit for a while and my bladder fills, it is less likely to leak when I stand up.(I'm tempted to drink non-stop, and keep my bladder full! lol ) Anybody else experienced this? Is it a good sign?",

As time goes by, things have got back to \"normal\" at work, and now it's only occasionally that someone asks about it. I think being proactive, and openly discussing it yourself puts people at ease, let's them know you are approachable, and can show them that it's not a \"taboo\" subject. A bunch of friends even threw me a pre-surgery dinner a couple of days before my surgery. Great food, lot's of wine and beer..... but I was on a damn liquid diet prior to my surgery!!",

      "Content": "Hi all. Found this forum by accident today, searching for help with my bladder issues, so I registered right away! From what I have read so far, there are lots of knowledgeable, helpful, and sincere people here, and I look forward to \"picking your brains\" I do have a couple of questions, but I will save them for another post. I was \"fortunate\" enough to be diagnosed in early March of this year. I say fortunate because I found out through a series of events stemming from my father-in-laws \"defective\" blood pressure machine. He was having problems with it, and asked me to check it out, so I took my BP with it. It was HIGH! My wife freaked out, and needless to say insisted I get a check up. I deferred for a few weeks, but monitored my BP with a machine I have at home.(whole other story! ) I kept track on my iPhone and eventually made an appointment for a check up. Doc ordered blood tests, including PSA, which came back at 5.4 (a little high for my age, I'm 55) My doc then INSISTED that he do a rectal exam, which I have never had done. So I said, what the hell, I'm there, might as well do it before I think about it too much. Well, the doc felt that my prostate felt a \"little abnormal\" and referred me to a urologist, who examined me, and suggested a biopsy be done. Biopsy was done under general anesthetic, thank God. Biopsy came back positive for cancer, so doc recommended a Radical Prostatectomy, which was done retropubic on April 23/13. I was in hospital for 6 days, staples removed after 5 days. Went home with my friend the catheter, which was removed May 8th. Now sitting at home recovering. That's my story, hope it's not to long for you. Mark",

Right now I am using Depends Guards, and they work OK, but, from my experience, they tend to bunch up a little, which can lead to leaks. At work I'll usually go through 4-5 pads per day. Thanks",

I just wear regular briefs right now. Off to Walmart! Mark",

      "Content": "Now 14 weeks post op and things were progressing well, just a minor set back a few weeks ago, my urine flow was really poor and it turned out to be sutures that hadn't dissolved and were blocking the urethra. Doctor cut them out and things were fine 'til 2 days ago and my flow almost totally stopped! Went to emerg as pressure built, and of course they had to put a catheter in..... 3 attempts later, and 3 different sized catheters. no luck! That was fun . Luckily, my urologist was on call in the OR, so they got me in within an hour (a new world record?). Turns out there was some scarring, BUT, worst of all, some of the sutures were still there!! Doc used his fancy laser thing and vaporized everything, and I spent the night in hospital. Catheter stays in for a couple of days, then things should be back to normal.... I hope. Has anybody had a similar experience with indestructible sutures?",

      "Content": "Bit of a trivial question really, considering the prevailing subject of this forum, but I was wondering how soon after surgery you guys got to soak in the tub? I was told 4 weeks, which is tomorrow for me. What is the reason for this? I was allowed to shower as soon as I went home from the hospital, as long as I didn't rub the incision directly. Unfortunately I neglected to ask my doc why I couldn't bathe, and he's away until May 27th, so I have waited as instructed, though it's been hard. I enjoy the occasional soak in the tub. Just curious. Mark",
