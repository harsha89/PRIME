      "Content": "I've read and learned enough. My decision is to go HIFU, it came when I took my wife in for her mamogram. The doctor showed us the photo and pointed out the area of possible cancer, or calcification, as they both show up as little diamonds, shiney dots. then she had the biopsy, and it was ultra sound guided, because the ultrasound can indeed show the cancer spots. thank God it was calcification, not cancer. But, I now acknowledge the value of the simple ultra sound machine. Maybe it hasn't been proven to work 10 years out, but nothing has. I just called international HIFU and am gathering up all my data for review by the doctor. I feel very relieved. It's only money afterall, and it's my future I am gambling with. And I have heard that Aetna pays, that's what I have. BTW, thanks lauriejo for your posts, although I've found many people at other sites talking with glowing remarks about their HIFU experience as well. Here is what I found helpful: HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue thus destroying the cancerous cells. Essentially, ultrasonic waves are precisely focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer with minimal risks of effecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100oC In lay terms, the HIFU technology is similar to using a magnifying glass to burn a piece of paper by focusing sunlight at a small precise point on the sheet. The ability to focus the ultrasonic waves leads to a relatively low occurrence of both incontinence and impotence. (0.6% and 0-20%, respectively. According to international studies, when compared to other procedures, HIFU has a high success rate with a reduced risk of side effects. HIFU was first used in the 1940s and 1950s in efforts to destroy tumors in the central nervous system. Since then, HIFU has been shown to be effective at destroying malignant tissue in the brain & prostate. Today, the HIFU procedure for prostate cancer is perfomed using a transrectal probe. This procedure has been performed for over ten years and is currently approved for use in Japan, Europe, Canada, and parts of Central and South America. It is completely non-invasive, except you do need a supra pubic catheter installed for 2 to 3 weeks.",

It's even in clinical trials, so it's free, it's being offered in many hospitals around the country. You can also pay for it.....Here is the article about the treatment -- I've heard it works exceptionally well for pain relief: http://www.fusfoundation.org/disease...one-metastases Here is the list of where to get it, looks like many hospitals in the USA to chose from, http://www.fusfoundation.org/the-tec...ll%20Countries My best wishes",

      "Content": "I've always read on forums about it and I've never seen that the c.c. remedy worked. However, in the medical community and in the wholistic community I've read again and again that red meat causes your cells to divide more rapidly and cancer to move fast. I also hear that about refined sugar, but we need sugar for energy, fruit supplies that. I'd recommend no red meat at all, only organic chicken (no hormones) and limit the refined sugar as much as he can. And stay on the hormones, they work. But look around and research what hormones he's on, some are better than others, and sometimes doctors are obliged to prescribe the lesser ones, but he can demand the hormone of his choice. Keep us posted, good luck.",

      "Content": "I've read and learned enough. My decision is to go HIFU, it came when I took my wife in for her mamogram. The doctor showed us the photo and pointed out the area of possible cancer, or calcification, as they both show up as little diamonds, shiney dots. then she had the biopsy, and it was ultra sound guided, because the ultrasound can indeed show the cancer spots. thank God it was calcification, not cancer. But, I now acknowledge the value of the simple ultra sound machine. Maybe it hasn't been proven to work 10 years out, but nothing has. I just called international HIFU and am gathering up all my data for review by the doctor. I feel very relieved. It's only money afterall, and it's my future I am gambling with. And I have heard that Aetna pays, that's what I have. BTW, thanks lauriejo for your posts, although I've found many people at other sites talking with glowing remarks about their HIFU experience as well. Here is what I found helpful: HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue thus destroying the cancerous cells. Essentially, ultrasonic waves are precisely focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer with minimal risks of effecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100oC In lay terms, the HIFU technology is similar to using a magnifying glass to burn a piece of paper by focusing sunlight at a small precise point on the sheet. The ability to focus the ultrasonic waves leads to a relatively low occurrence of both incontinence and impotence. (0.6% and 0-20%, respectively. According to international studies, when compared to other procedures, HIFU has a high success rate with a reduced risk of side effects. HIFU was first used in the 1940s and 1950s in efforts to destroy tumors in the central nervous system. Since then, HIFU has been shown to be effective at destroying malignant tissue in the brain & prostate. Today, the HIFU procedure for prostate cancer is perfomed using a transrectal probe. This procedure has been performed for over ten years and is currently approved for use in Japan, Europe, Canada, and parts of Central and South America. It is completely non-invasive, except you do need a supra pubic catheter installed for 2 to 3 weeks.",

      "Content": "I've read and learned enough. My decision is to go HIFU, it came when I took my wife in for her mamogram. The doctor showed us the photo and pointed out the area of possible cancer, or calcification, as they both show up as little diamonds, shiney dots. then she had the biopsy, and it was ultra sound guided, because the ultrasound can indeed show the cancer spots. thank God it was calcification, not cancer. But, I now acknowledge the value of the simple ultra sound machine. Maybe it hasn't been proven to work 10 years out, but nothing has. I just called international HIFU and am gathering up all my data for review by the doctor. I feel very relieved. It's only money afterall, and it's my future I am gambling with. And I have heard that Aetna pays, that's what I have. BTW, thanks lauriejo for your posts, although I've found many people at other sites talking with glowing remarks about their HIFU experience as well. Here is what I found helpful: HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue thus destroying the cancerous cells. Essentially, ultrasonic waves are precisely focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer with minimal risks of effecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100oC In lay terms, the HIFU technology is similar to using a magnifying glass to burn a piece of paper by focusing sunlight at a small precise point on the sheet. The ability to focus the ultrasonic waves leads to a relatively low occurrence of both incontinence and impotence. (0.6% and 0-20%, respectively. According to international studies, when compared to other procedures, HIFU has a high success rate with a reduced risk of side effects. HIFU was first used in the 1940s and 1950s in efforts to destroy tumors in the central nervous system. Since then, HIFU has been shown to be effective at destroying malignant tissue in the brain & prostate. Today, the HIFU procedure for prostate cancer is perfomed using a transrectal probe. This procedure has been performed for over ten years and is currently approved for use in Japan, Europe, Canada, and parts of Central and South America. It is completely non-invasive, except you do need a supra pubic catheter installed for 2 to 3 weeks.",

      "Content": "I've read and learned enough. My decision is to go HIFU, it came when I took my wife in for her mamogram. The doctor showed us the photo and pointed out the area of possible cancer, or calcification, as they both show up as little diamonds, shiney dots. then she had the biopsy, and it was ultra sound guided, because the ultrasound can indeed show the cancer spots. thank God it was calcification, not cancer. But, I now acknowledge the value of the simple ultra sound machine. Maybe it hasn't been proven to work 10 years out, but nothing has. I just called international HIFU and am gathering up all my data for review by the doctor. I feel very relieved. It's only money afterall, and it's my future I am gambling with. And I have heard that Aetna pays, that's what I have. BTW, thanks lauriejo for your posts, although I've found many people at other sites talking with glowing remarks about their HIFU experience as well. Here is what I found helpful: HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue thus destroying the cancerous cells. Essentially, ultrasonic waves are precisely focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer with minimal risks of effecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100oC In lay terms, the HIFU technology is similar to using a magnifying glass to burn a piece of paper by focusing sunlight at a small precise point on the sheet. The ability to focus the ultrasonic waves leads to a relatively low occurrence of both incontinence and impotence. (0.6% and 0-20%, respectively. According to international studies, when compared to other procedures, HIFU has a high success rate with a reduced risk of side effects. HIFU was first used in the 1940s and 1950s in efforts to destroy tumors in the central nervous system. Since then, HIFU has been shown to be effective at destroying malignant tissue in the brain & prostate. Today, the HIFU procedure for prostate cancer is perfomed using a transrectal probe. This procedure has been performed for over ten years and is currently approved for use in Japan, Europe, Canada, and parts of Central and South America. It is completely non-invasive, except you do need a supra pubic catheter installed for 2 to 3 weeks.",

      "Content": "I've read and learned enough. My decision is to go HIFU, it came when I took my wife in for her mamogram. The doctor showed us the photo and pointed out the area of possible cancer, or calcification, as they both show up as little diamonds, shiney dots. then she had the biopsy, and it was ultra sound guided, because the ultrasound can indeed show the cancer spots. thank God it was calcification, not cancer. But, I now acknowledge the value of the simple ultra sound machine. Maybe it hasn't been proven to work 10 years out, but nothing has. I just called international HIFU and am gathering up all my data for review by the doctor. I feel very relieved. It's only money afterall, and it's my future I am gambling with. And I have heard that Aetna pays, that's what I have. BTW, thanks lauriejo for your posts, although I've found many people at other sites talking with glowing remarks about their HIFU experience as well. Here is what I found helpful: HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue thus destroying the cancerous cells. Essentially, ultrasonic waves are precisely focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer with minimal risks of effecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100oC In lay terms, the HIFU technology is similar to using a magnifying glass to burn a piece of paper by focusing sunlight at a small precise point on the sheet. The ability to focus the ultrasonic waves leads to a relatively low occurrence of both incontinence and impotence. (0.6% and 0-20%, respectively. According to international studies, when compared to other procedures, HIFU has a high success rate with a reduced risk of side effects. HIFU was first used in the 1940s and 1950s in efforts to destroy tumors in the central nervous system. Since then, HIFU has been shown to be effective at destroying malignant tissue in the brain & prostate. Today, the HIFU procedure for prostate cancer is perfomed using a transrectal probe. This procedure has been performed for over ten years and is currently approved for use in Japan, Europe, Canada, and parts of Central and South America. It is completely non-invasive, except you do need a supra pubic catheter installed for 2 to 3 weeks.",

      "Content": "I've read and learned enough. My decision is to go HIFU, it came when I took my wife in for her mamogram. The doctor showed us the photo and pointed out the area of possible cancer, or calcification, as they both show up as little diamonds, shiney dots. then she had the biopsy, and it was ultra sound guided, because the ultrasound can indeed show the cancer spots. thank God it was calcification, not cancer. But, I now acknowledge the value of the simple ultra sound machine. Maybe it hasn't been proven to work 10 years out, but nothing has. I just called international HIFU and am gathering up all my data for review by the doctor. I feel very relieved. It's only money afterall, and it's my future I am gambling with. And I have heard that Aetna pays, that's what I have. BTW, thanks lauriejo for your posts, although I've found many people at other sites talking with glowing remarks about their HIFU experience as well. Here is what I found helpful: HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue thus destroying the cancerous cells. Essentially, ultrasonic waves are precisely focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer with minimal risks of effecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100oC In lay terms, the HIFU technology is similar to using a magnifying glass to burn a piece of paper by focusing sunlight at a small precise point on the sheet. The ability to focus the ultrasonic waves leads to a relatively low occurrence of both incontinence and impotence. (0.6% and 0-20%, respectively. According to international studies, when compared to other procedures, HIFU has a high success rate with a reduced risk of side effects. HIFU was first used in the 1940s and 1950s in efforts to destroy tumors in the central nervous system. Since then, HIFU has been shown to be effective at destroying malignant tissue in the brain & prostate. Today, the HIFU procedure for prostate cancer is perfomed using a transrectal probe. This procedure has been performed for over ten years and is currently approved for use in Japan, Europe, Canada, and parts of Central and South America. It is completely non-invasive, except you do need a supra pubic catheter installed for 2 to 3 weeks.",

The doctor showed us the photo and pointed out the area of possible cancer, or calcification, as they both show up as little diamonds, shiney dots. then she had the biopsy, and it was ultra sound guided, because the ultrasound can indeed show the cancer spots. thank God it was calcification, not cancer. But, I now acknowledge the value of the simple ultra sound machine. Maybe it hasn't been proven to work 10 years out, but nothing has. I just called international HIFU and am gathering up all my data for review by the doctor. I feel very relieved. It's only money afterall, and it's my future I am gambling with.

BTW, thanks lauriejo for your posts, although I've found many people at other sites talking with glowing remarks about their HIFU experience as well. Here is what I found helpful: HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue thus destroying the cancerous cells. Essentially, ultrasonic waves are precisely focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer with minimal risks of effecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100oC In lay terms, the HIFU technology is similar to using a magnifying glass to burn a piece of paper by focusing sunlight at a small precise point on the sheet. The ability to focus the ultrasonic waves leads to a relatively low occurrence of both incontinence and impotence. (0.6% and 0-20%, respectively. According to international studies, when compared to other procedures, HIFU has a high success rate with a reduced risk of side effects. HIFU was first used in the 1940s and 1950s in efforts to destroy tumors in the central nervous system. Since then, HIFU has been shown to be effective at destroying malignant tissue in the brain & prostate. Today, the HIFU procedure for prostate cancer is perfomed using a transrectal probe. This procedure has been performed for over ten years and is currently approved for use in Japan, Europe, Canada, and parts of Central and South America. It is completely non-invasive, except you do need a supra pubic catheter installed for 2 to 3 weeks.",

The doctor showed us the photo and pointed out the area of possible cancer, or calcification, as they both show up as little diamonds, shiney dots. then she had the biopsy, and it was ultra sound guided, because the ultrasound can indeed show the cancer spots. thank God it was calcification, not cancer. But, I now acknowledge the value of the simple ultra sound machine. Maybe it hasn't been proven to work 10 years out, but nothing has.

Here is what I found helpful: HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue thus destroying the cancerous cells. Essentially, ultrasonic waves are precisely focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer with minimal risks of effecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100oC In lay terms, the HIFU technology is similar to using a magnifying glass to burn a piece of paper by focusing sunlight at a small precise point on the sheet. The ability to focus the ultrasonic waves leads to a relatively low occurrence of both incontinence and impotence. (0.6% and 0-20%, respectively. According to international studies, when compared to other procedures, HIFU has a high success rate with a reduced risk of side effects.
