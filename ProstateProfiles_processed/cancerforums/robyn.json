      "Content": "OUr current recommendation is to have a mapping biopsy (takes 60-80 cores, under general anesthesia) first, and if the cancer is confined to one or two small areas and not near vital structures, then it will be treated w/ spot radiation or cryo. We really hadn't considered this before until this particular surgeon told us \"we are vastly overtreating prostate cancer\" and that given my husband's numbers (G6, psa 4.5, 5% of one core), surgery or seeds are overkill. Interesting perspective between surgery/seeds and WW. Robyn",
