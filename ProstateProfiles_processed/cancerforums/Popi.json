      "Content": "Originally Posted by Walnut You must know and define your goals. The MRI with rectal coil cannot diagnose cancer for sure, but it can tell you that you \"for sure\" need a biopsy. . That's half my goal, right there...the other half is to give the doc a more precise target other than the entire prostate. Sticking 12 needles into something the size of a pea (if the MRi actually finds something) is preferable to 12 needles being stuck, somewhat haphazardly, into something the size of a large walnut (no pun intended). I really am all for biopsies, I just want better ones. OT...how does the Doc know when it's OK to remove the catheter?",

      "Content": "Wondering why we seem to be getting a biopsy prior to a MRI (or no MRI at all). With 3T/4T MRIs, tumors can very easily be found, and they're non-invasive scans...no needles, and thus, no chance of infection. I'm still waiting for my follow-up same-day PSA test in February, but my Doc has only mentioned a biopsy, and never a MRI. I don't see any downsides outweighing any benefits. Yes, a biopsy is necessary to determine cancer type, but with so many biopsies missing the tumor (edit: very surprised regarding the percentage of false negatives), wouldn't a MRI prior to the procedure pretty much ensure the samples are taken from the correct location within the prostate? Am I missing something?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago Simply put, you don't seem to understand why doctors don't want to order repeat PSA testing sooner than you think would be good. All you get by testing too soon is another test result that isn't reliable. Why would getting the test sooner than what the Doctor ordered make it unreliable? My guess, waiting 3-4 months between tests simply allows time for a significant enough change to take place. Three tests in one year, or 10 tests in one year...you're still going to arrive at the same numbers by the end. A test result is nothing more than a data point, and really, what's so bad about having more test results than what's normally obtained. If kept in perspective (a 2% rise is not the same as a 90% rise), can you really have too much data? I'm still going to my appointment in February, and I'm still planning on coordinating any possible future care with my doctor, but this test will satisfy my curiosity, more quickly, whether or not, and to what extent, sex affected MY scores.",
