      "Content": "Total newbie here. In fact, I haven't even had my initial consultation with a urologist yet! It's tomorrow, Thursday. So I'm still just preparing, thinking of the questions I should ask, worrying (of course!), etc. The background is this: I'm 69 and generally in decent health, except that I'm type II insulin-dependent diabetic. I have a PSA test annually with my PCP and he does a DRE. That was done in September. I think I recall he said my PSA then was 4-something, but I honestly do not remember. I can't tell you what my history has been farther back than last September. I know I need to close that knowledge gap, for my own benefit, and I will. I plan to ask my PCP's nurse tomorrow to give me my PSA history! I have known for 10-15 years that my prostate is, according to a PCP from the mid-90s, \"a little generous\". I do have the usual frequent night time urination symptom, but I'm also diabetic, and frequent urination is a common symptom of that illness also, so I've always attributed that to the diabetes at least as much as to BPH. My PCP told me he wanted to recheck PSA in December, and he did. In mid-December, he said it was 7-something, and at that point he referred me to a urologist. Like I said, that initial consultation is tomorrow. I have no idea what will happen then, but I guess I'd expect another DRE and maybe another blood sample/PSA test? I do also want to point out this fact, which I intend to discuss tomorrow. As I said, I am type II insulin-dependent diabetic. During the 3-4 day period when I had the Dec PSA blood sample drawn, I did experience difficulty with high blood glucose. At the time, I attributed it to the usual problems I have with BG, which for me are more common than with many diabetics. But I also recall that during that period of high BG, I also was having some minor bowel problems. I did not have diarrhea, but I was close. It was quite clear to me my bowels were not normal. I was definitely abnormal, for almost the entire 3-4 day period in question. Once that problem went away of its own accord, my BG returned to (for me) normal. My question now is: how worrisome is a rate of rise like I've experienced here? What chance is there that this rate of rise I've experienced was due more to that intestinal abnormality than to a long-term problem with the big C?",

      "Content": "I'm totally new here. I just had an initial consultation yesterday with a urologist. My PSA rose from 4ish to a bit over 7 between last Sept and last Dec, and my PCP referred me. The urologist did a DRE and said I feel normal. I told him I had been having abdominal problems and bowel irregularities during the 4-day time period in which the Dec blood sample was taken, and he agreed that I should take Cipro for a week first, and then he'll repeat the PSA in a couple weeks. He said \"maybe you can avoid a biopsy\". So, no decision yet, but the DRE did sound encouraging, I guess. My question now has to do with the biopsy process from a scheduling point of view, not merely medical. The next PSA test is scheduled for mid-February. If the Dr decides I do need a biopsy, are those things usually scheduled to take place within days of his decision to do it, for example? Or is it more liketo to get scheduled longer than that in the future? Then, once I have it, how rapidly might I return to fairly normal activities? Hours? Days? Weeks? My reason for asking is: right now, we're planning a 2-week RV trip March 5-18. If the PSA is done Feb 17, is it practical to plan on fitting in the biopsy between then and going on the RV vacation March 5? Or is more likely that the biopsy would be put off till after mid-March? Or am I being too anal (no pun intended) to try to preplan this closely anyway?!",

      "Content": "I'm totally new here. No clue at all what to expect or what to do. My PCP told me my PSA has risen suddenly, from 4-something to 7-something in 3 months. So he has referred me to the urology firm in town that he typically refers people to. I have no idea at all if they're competent or not. But today I checked their web page and found out the \"doc\" I'm going to see for my initial consultation later this week is not an M.D., he's a D.O. I've Googled that term also, but I still have no clue at all if I'm being sent to a real doctor I can trust or to some guy with webbed feet. All I know for sure is that 60 years ago, a D.O. almost killed my grandmother because he didn't know what the **** he was doing and what was wrong with her. When my dad found out (after he came down from hitting the roof) he pulled his mom out of the hospital where she was and got her an M.D., and in a very short time she was fine and back home. So my one data point with a D.O. is not a good one. Should I be concerned? If I am, and the urology firm does have other doctors who are in fact M.D., what should I do?",
