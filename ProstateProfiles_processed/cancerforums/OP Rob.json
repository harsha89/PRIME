      "Content": "I'd had increasing PSA resulting in two \"regular\" biopsies (number one had one sample with PIN, number two was clean) over about five years beginning in my mid-50s. When my PSA hit 9.7 in March, my internist sent me to new urologist (the previous one left town) who ended up doing a saturation biopsy - 24 specimens on May 22. Getting a call from your urologist on a Saturday is rarely a good thing, and on May 25he called to tell me one of the 24 samples had a Gleason score of 4+3. We talked about treatment, and his thoughts were radiation or surgery. After some research I was pretty set on surgery. He also recommended a bone scan and abdominal CT, which I did in early June, and both were negative. Now to find a surgeon At age 60 I had only been admitted to a hospital once when I was a kid, and had never had any surgery or general anesthesia. It turns out the University of Kansas Medical Center is the only NCI hospital in town, and the head of the urology practice, Dr. Thrasher, has been doing robotic surgery for eight years. I was able to get an appointment to meet Dr. Thrasher on June 25th. I liked him immediately and after some discussion we agreed robotic surgery was the way I was going to go. One of his lines stuck with me - something to the effect that after surgey \"you'll have the urinary tract of a 60-year old woman.\" Being married to one, I knew this was not necessarily something to look forward to. Surgery was scheduled for July 15th. As an aside, I'd had an umbilical hernia for some time, so I asked if Thrasher could do the repair while I was getting my prostate removed, and he said no problem. So now to the subject line. While he was excising my prostate, he noticed urine leaking out of the prostate itself, and discovered my left kidney had two ureters. One routed correctly, the other connected directly to the prostate. The prostate then backed this flow into my bladder, so I'd never known of this anatomic abnormality. Needless to say this required some additional plumbing on his part, connecting the second ureter to my bladder. He said clamping it off wasn't an option as both ureters on this side were undersized, and both were needed to drain the kidney. I apparently was also a useful teaching aid for his residents. So I went home on July 17th with a catheter that was in for two weeks, a surgical drain (so they could determine if anything was leaking) that stayed in for 10 days,and a stent in my bonus ureter for six weeks. The only thing that hurt was the hernia repair, which ended up as an open procedure and thus my only real scar, but I was off percocet within five days. I will say having the stent removed created some of the weirdest sensations - it wasn't painful per se, but it felt very odd - I'd ever experienced. Pathology couldn't have been better. Tumor was downgraded to a 3+4 (still a 7, but a \"better\" 7), 5% volume and clean margins. PSA undetecable at three months. Still working on continence, but making progress as long as I don't have a beer or two watching football. All in all, a good outcome. Now if I can just get my wife to buy pads for me....",

      "Content": "Two and a half years out from robotic surgery, uro turned me over to primary care after two years of \"undetectable\" PSA. New PCP uses a different lab. Here's their note from yesterday's PSA: Your PSA is very low at 0.01. Your past 2 reports were <0.1 ng/ml which is considered undetectable so I would still consider this year's level undetectable since it is well under 0.1 ng/ml. I'm not sure why they changed the way it is reported, but again, I do not think 0.01 ng/ml is worrisome. I understand different labs have different sensitivities, and as reported my PSA isn't \"undetectable,\" although .01 is way less than .1. Is this worth a re-test at 6 months? Curious more than concerned. Surgeon said I was good for an annual PSA. My post-op pathology was excellent, nothing outside the prostate, small 3+4 tumor.",

He does four or five DaVinci's a week - at least the did in 2013, and has been doing them a looong time. Great guy, outstanding surgeon. My pathology was similar to yours, and PSA remains undetectable three years out. As he was excising my prostate he noticed it was leaking urine, which is odd to say the least. Turns out my left kidney has two ureters, one of which had attached itself to the prostate rather than the bladder. So he \"simply\" made an opening in the bladder and stitched it in place. So I got to spend two night rather than one. It's a big practice, but Thrasher's THE guy.",
