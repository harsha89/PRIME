      "Content": "Pratoman: I can't speak to the lymph node but I reiterate your observation that the tiny 3mm lung nodule is only 2 more than one silly little millimeter. If you look closely at my lung history, you will find a nodule SIX TIMES larger at 1.8 CM. It scared me. Three doctors had their fingers on the slice-and-dice machine but the damn thing disappeared at the end of 3 months. One thing I did learn about pulmonology is that the overall public would be aghast if they knew the junk that floats intermittently into and out of their lungs -- some harmful, some not. This MAY be nothing -- stay strong. Jim",

      "Content": "jefft: Thank you for sharing that wonderful news. It will go a long way toward helping others who find themselves in similar circumstances. I agree that the DaVinci machine has brought this disease to a level where it allows patients to experience the modern advances of science without the fear of so many who don't want to undergo the rigors of open surgery. Even more remarkable (at least to me) are the benefits rendered by the PSA test. The PSA led me to surgery. The PSA found the cancer when it returned and allowed me to proceed with salvage radiation. So, it may have saved my life twice. Whenever I'm in the company of guys over 50 who are friends or relatives, I beseech them to get annual PSA tests. Some never heard of the PSA and that's unfortunate because this is a disease that is almost always curable with early treatment. And the people on that government panel who want to save money and eliminate the PSA because it \"may\" lead to unnecessary treatment and unwanted side effects can go pound sand up their kazoo. They claim that only one life is saved for each PSA test, which I think is a horrible underestimate. What they fail to mention - even if you accept their numbers - is that for every one million PSA tests, a thousand lives are saved. If ANY test can save a thousand lives, that's a good thing, right? Again, congrats. Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter . For example, an Italian study published in 2010 looked at post op PNI found by post op pathology and recurrence. Here is a link to the report: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20516669 And here is the statement they made: The actuarial biochemical progression-free survival rate for all patients was 96.9 and 93.5% at 60 and 84 months, respectively, and the stratification based on the presence or absence of PNI did not allow us to identify different prognostic groups. Here is a summary by The \"NEW\" Prostate Cancer Infolink: http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/20...me-of-surgery/ who stated: This study appears to suggest that the prognostic impact of PNI on risk for progressive prostate cancer is actually much lower than has been assumed in the past. So, I believe mom2two should not worry too much about the PNI finding in the pathology report. Peace. AN ITALIAN STUDY?? With all of the high tech medical resources in this country, we're going to fall back on a 4-year-old ITALIAN study?",

      "Content": "My only cystoscopy had nothing to do with my prostate cancer. In 2008 and 2014, I had a kidney stone block my left ureter -- horrible, horribly painful -- and had to have surgery to have it removed (two nights in hospital -- fun, fun, fun). After each surgery, standard procedure is to place a stent in the ureter that must remain in place for 7 to 10 days to prevent it from collapsing. In 2008, the stent caused me to have significant pain. Couldn't wait to get it out. In 2014, three days after surgery, I awoke at home to find that I could not urinate. Not a drop. Very scary. I had visions of my bladder expanding and exploding. Called the uro and he had me come to the office where he used a temporary catheter to clear the blockage. On the fifth day after surgery, the same thing happened. No pain but couldn't pee. Back to the office where he started to insert the cystoscope. I started moaning. He said \"What's wrong?\". I said I was scared to death something very bad was about to happen. He put the scope in -- no pain at all, just a weird feeling. He cleared the blockage, then removed the scope and went back in and removed the stent. Also, no pain or discomfort after the procedure. All in all, I found the cystoscopy to be a piece of cake. Hope you have the same experience.",

      "Content": "\"Depressed and barely functioning\" Welcome Ernie: Your reaction to learning you have the \"Big C\" is certainly understandable. At age 55, you should not have to deal with this. As our esteemed moderator, Chuck, has pointed out based upon your test results, treatment is indicated. He listed the options available to you. I'd like to point out that the primary focus should always be on the mortality issue. With that in mind, if you're going to have cancer, this is the one you want because when caught early and treated, it is almost always 100% survivable. Following treatment, most PC patients go on to lead a normal life. Yes, there are sometimes side effects but we're still here and you will be, also. If you really want to know what it's truly like to be depressed, when you have time, take a look at some of the other cancer threads on this website. Some have 5-year survivor rates of only 6-16%. I have friends on the lung cancer thread and I find it difficult to communicate with them without crying-- and I don't cry easily. So, as I see it, we're the lucky ones. And you'll still be here with plenty of time to settle with the IRS. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Two facts: 1. SBRT/Cyberknife is a whole gland treatment. It uses a precision targeting system to deliver highly focused radiation dosages. It is no more \"focal\" than a surgical cut, an EBRT beam, or a brachy seed. All whole gland treatments involve a series of local actions. 2. SBRT/Cyberknife is not new. It was FDA approved in 2001, and has treated over 40,000 patients, with the numbers sharply increasing in recent years. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/119573/abstract https://www.sciencedaily.com/release...0418145458.htm While I am not a fan of super-star Dr. Samadi, just to throw a little gasoline on the Cyberknife discussion, here are his thoughts on the subject from his website: Q. What are the side effects of Cyber Knife? A. The negative side effects of CyberKnife® can be expected to mirror those of other targeted radiation therapies. Over the short term, radiation therapy for prostate cancer can cause: Urination problems including burning and blood in the urine Urinary urgency and frequency Weakened urinary stream Incomplete emptying of the bladder Anal and rectal irritation, rectal bleeding, hemorrhoids, and stool problems Fatigue and nausea Long-term CyberKnife® and prostate cancer radiation side effects may include: Sexual impotence and/or erectile dysfunction for up to 2 years after treatment Delayed orgasm or ejaculation Temporary or permanent reduction in sperm count; fertility should be discussed with your physician prior to CyberKnife® treatment Impaired bowel function Potential increased risk of bladder or rectal cancer by 5% And post-treatment patient satisfaction surveys repeatedly show Cyberknife as the LEAST popular method of treating prostate cancer, primarily due to radiation burns from the massive doses of radiation versus the decades-old gold standard of 35 - 40 sessions of EBRT.",

      "Content": "jefft: Thank you for sharing that wonderful news. It will go a long way toward helping others who find themselves in similar circumstances. I agree that the DaVinci machine has brought this disease to a level where it allows patients to experience the modern advances of science without the fear of so many who don't want to undergo the rigors of open surgery. Even more remarkable (at least to me) are the benefits rendered by the PSA test. The PSA led me to surgery. The PSA found the cancer when it returned and allowed me to proceed with salvage radiation. So, it may have saved my life twice. Whenever I'm in the company of guys over 50 who are friends or relatives, I beseech them to get annual PSA tests. Some never heard of the PSA and that's unfortunate because this is a disease that is almost always curable with early treatment. And the people on that government panel who want to save money and eliminate the PSA because it \"may\" lead to unnecessary treatment and unwanted side effects can go pound sand up their kazoo. They claim that only one life is saved for each PSA test, which I think is a horrible underestimate. What they fail to mention - even if you accept their numbers - is that for every one million PSA tests, a thousand lives are saved. If ANY test can save a thousand lives, that's a good thing, right? Again, congrats. Jim",

Then, in December 2015, after your PSA had inexplicably doubled in four months to 9.54, you decided on surgery and scheduled it for April. But, then because the PSA dropped in March, you cancelled the surgery and returned to active surveillance. Now, you underwent an MRI and another biopsy??? My head is starting to do that Linda Blair-type 360-degree spin from The Exorcist. You were diagnosed with prostate cancer via a biopsy!! Yes, it's a G6, however as Chuck noted, it's 80% involved. When your PSA number decreased in March, that didn't change the fact that you have prostate cancer. The lower PSA number doesn't mean the cancer went away!! If you had decided on surgery, the change in PSA IMHO had no bearing whatsoever on anything. What did you expect to accomplish with a second biopsy? You already know you have prostate cancer. What did you expect to accomplish with the recent MRI? You already know you have prostate cancer. Sorry. Had to wait for my head to stop spinning. Good luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman I would like to correct a fallacy that's been stated here a number of times.. It is incorrect to say that surgery cannot be done after radiation. There are surgeons who do it, and some specialize in it. For example. The surgeons at MSKCC do it. Specifically, Dr James Eastham, you can go to his website and see that it's an area that he specializes in. It is clearly more difficult after radiation, and side effects Alan be more severe, but it can be done. Called Salvage surgery. I discussed this with my RO, in our consult. Also, there are other alternatives if brachybor EBRT fail, such as cryosurgery, and other treatments . So to say surgery is not an option after radiation is not correct. It's not as straightforward , but can be and is, done. Also, in my consult with the RO at MSKCC, he explained that salvage radiation, after failed surgery, is only successful 50% of the time. Two pints of contention: Whenever the discussion of not being able to have surgery after radiation, most members, including me, use the term \"rarely\". That's because only a handful of surgeons across the country will attempt it and most patients would have to fly to a strange city to be treated by a doctor whom they've never seen before. After the hospital stay, short-term recovery will be in a local hotel/motel before flying back home. Then what happens if there are complications once you return home? No local doctor is going to want to resolve problems created by a high-risk out-of-town surgery. And to say that salvage radiation is only successful 50% of the time is factually incorrect.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman I would like to correct a fallacy that's been stated here a number of times.. It is incorrect to say that surgery cannot be done after radiation. There are surgeons who do it, and some specialize in it. For example. The surgeons at MSKCC do it. Specifically, Dr James Eastham, you can go to his website and see that it's an area that he specializes in. It is clearly more difficult after radiation, and side effects Alan be more severe, but it can be done. Called Salvage surgery. I discussed this with my RO, in our consult. Also, there are other alternatives if brachybor EBRT fail, such as cryosurgery, and other treatments . So to say surgery is not an option after radiation is not correct. It's not as straightforward , but can be and is, done. Also, in my consult with the RO at MSKCC, he explained that salvage radiation, after failed surgery, is only successful 50% of the time. Two pints of contention: Whenever the discussion of not being able to have surgery after radiation, most members, including me, use the term \"rarely\". That's because only a handful of surgeons across the country will attempt it and most patients would have to fly to a strange city to be treated by a doctor whom they've never seen before. After the hospital stay, short-term recovery will be in a local hotel/motel before flying back home. Then what happens if there are complications once you return home? No local doctor is going to want to resolve problems created by a high-risk out-of-town surgery. And to say that salvage radiation is only successful 50% of the time is factually incorrect.",

      "Content": "Hi Mike: Over the years, patients always seem to be in a rush to get their first post-surgery PSA result and it can often be misleading. At six weeks post-surgery, your PSA of 1.1 is certainly not undetectable, but it may not tell the whole story. History has shown that the PSA reading at 3 months post-surgery is a more reliable number. With that said, it is not intended to minimize the G8-9 you are dealing with and the anticipated follow-up radiation and HT. My salvage radiation is nearly 4 years in the rear-view mirror and, although I was G7, my PSA remains at 0.00. So, a successful outcome IS possible. For how long? Who knows? Best of luck, Jim",

Here is a link to the report: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20516669 And here is the statement they made: The actuarial biochemical progression-free survival rate for all patients was 96.9 and 93.5% at 60 and 84 months, respectively, and the stratification based on the presence or absence of PNI did not allow us to identify different prognostic groups. Here is a summary by The \"NEW\" Prostate Cancer Infolink: http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/20...me-of-surgery/ who stated: This study appears to suggest that the prognostic impact of PNI on risk for progressive prostate cancer is actually much lower than has been assumed in the past. So, I believe mom2two should not worry too much about the PNI finding in the pathology report. Peace. AN ITALIAN STUDY?? With all of the high tech medical resources in this country, we're going to fall back on a 4-year-old ITALIAN study?",

      "Content": "Welcome fixit: This is the place to find support and caring people who will \"gently\" help to guide you. Unfortunately, I'm more pragmatic. Your urologist said to get a biopsy. Your response: \"Oh, what should I do?\". Again, following another PSA test, your doctor said to get a biopsy. Again, you procrastinated. Next, you have a 4k blood test which is a confirmation of nothing -- never is. You could have just as easily spent money on a palm reader. She can't confirm anything, either. As noted, only a biopsy will provide confirmation of cancer -- nothing else. It's not rocket science -- you need a biopsy. You have no monopoly on scared -- few of us can say we weren't afraid but it's a necessary evil -- you need the biopsy. It's nothing more than a diagnostic test, just as the PSA test is diagnostic and you didn't hesitate there. Complications arise in a very small percentage of biopsies. On the other hand, there is no debate about the fact that this can be a deadly disease but it's nearly 100% curable when found early and treated. Thirty thousand men die in the U.S. every year from prostate cancer. Don't be one of them. Your urologist went to medical school for a zillion years and he got it right. You need the biopsy. NOTE: A 3T MRI is performed in SUPPORY of a biopsy, not an opportunity to REJECT a biopsy which has ALREADY been determined is needed. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Two facts: 1. SBRT/Cyberknife is a whole gland treatment. It uses a precision targeting system to deliver highly focused radiation dosages. It is no more \"focal\" than a surgical cut, an EBRT beam, or a brachy seed. All whole gland treatments involve a series of local actions. 2. SBRT/Cyberknife is not new. It was FDA approved in 2001, and has treated over 40,000 patients, with the numbers sharply increasing in recent years. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/119573/abstract https://www.sciencedaily.com/release...0418145458.htm While I am not a fan of super-star Dr. Samadi, just to throw a little gasoline on the Cyberknife discussion, here are his thoughts on the subject from his website: Q. What are the side effects of Cyber Knife? A. The negative side effects of CyberKnife® can be expected to mirror those of other targeted radiation therapies. Over the short term, radiation therapy for prostate cancer can cause: Urination problems including burning and blood in the urine Urinary urgency and frequency Weakened urinary stream Incomplete emptying of the bladder Anal and rectal irritation, rectal bleeding, hemorrhoids, and stool problems Fatigue and nausea Long-term CyberKnife® and prostate cancer radiation side effects may include: Sexual impotence and/or erectile dysfunction for up to 2 years after treatment Delayed orgasm or ejaculation Temporary or permanent reduction in sperm count; fertility should be discussed with your physician prior to CyberKnife® treatment Impaired bowel function Potential increased risk of bladder or rectal cancer by 5% And post-treatment patient satisfaction surveys repeatedly show Cyberknife as the LEAST popular method of treating prostate cancer, primarily due to radiation burns from the massive doses of radiation versus the decades-old gold standard of 35 - 40 sessions of EBRT.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman I would like to correct a fallacy that's been stated here a number of times.. It is incorrect to say that surgery cannot be done after radiation. There are surgeons who do it, and some specialize in it. For example. The surgeons at MSKCC do it. Specifically, Dr James Eastham, you can go to his website and see that it's an area that he specializes in. It is clearly more difficult after radiation, and side effects Alan be more severe, but it can be done. Called Salvage surgery. I discussed this with my RO, in our consult. Also, there are other alternatives if brachybor EBRT fail, such as cryosurgery, and other treatments . So to say surgery is not an option after radiation is not correct. It's not as straightforward , but can be and is, done. Also, in my consult with the RO at MSKCC, he explained that salvage radiation, after failed surgery, is only successful 50% of the time. Two pints of contention: Whenever the discussion of not being able to have surgery after radiation, most members, including me, use the term \"rarely\". That's because only a handful of surgeons across the country will attempt it and most patients would have to fly to a strange city to be treated by a doctor whom they've never seen before. After the hospital stay, short-term recovery will be in a local hotel/motel before flying back home. Then what happens if there are complications once you return home? No local doctor is going to want to resolve problems created by a high-risk out-of-town surgery. And to say that salvage radiation is only successful 50% of the time is factually incorrect.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman I would like to correct a fallacy that's been stated here a number of times.. It is incorrect to say that surgery cannot be done after radiation. There are surgeons who do it, and some specialize in it. For example. The surgeons at MSKCC do it. Specifically, Dr James Eastham, you can go to his website and see that it's an area that he specializes in. It is clearly more difficult after radiation, and side effects Alan be more severe, but it can be done. Called Salvage surgery. I discussed this with my RO, in our consult. Also, there are other alternatives if brachybor EBRT fail, such as cryosurgery, and other treatments . So to say surgery is not an option after radiation is not correct. It's not as straightforward , but can be and is, done. Also, in my consult with the RO at MSKCC, he explained that salvage radiation, after failed surgery, is only successful 50% of the time. Two pints of contention: Whenever the discussion of not being able to have surgery after radiation, most members, including me, use the term \"rarely\". That's because only a handful of surgeons across the country will attempt it and most patients would have to fly to a strange city to be treated by a doctor whom they've never seen before. After the hospital stay, short-term recovery will be in a local hotel/motel before flying back home. Then what happens if there are complications once you return home? No local doctor is going to want to resolve problems created by a high-risk out-of-town surgery. And to say that salvage radiation is only successful 50% of the time is factually incorrect.",

      "Content": "\"Bottom line MRI showed nothing to worry about a few months ago,\" Really? Except for the fact that you had ALREADY been diagnosed with prostate cancer prior to the MRI? Hi namvet6971: Got to be honest with you -- I've never seen a history quite like yours. You had a biopsy in August, 2015 revealing a Gleason 6 prostate cancer in 2 cores with an 80% involvement in one core. You went to Aruba. Then, in December 2015, after your PSA had inexplicably doubled in four months to 9.54, you decided on surgery and scheduled it for April. But, then because the PSA dropped in March, you cancelled the surgery and returned to active surveillance. Now, you underwent an MRI and another biopsy??? My head is starting to do that Linda Blair-type 360-degree spin from The Exorcist. You were diagnosed with prostate cancer via a biopsy!! Yes, it's a G6, however as Chuck noted, it's 80% involved. When your PSA number decreased in March, that didn't change the fact that you have prostate cancer. The lower PSA number doesn't mean the cancer went away!! If you had decided on surgery, the change in PSA IMHO had no bearing whatsoever on anything. What did you expect to accomplish with a second biopsy? You already know you have prostate cancer. What did you expect to accomplish with the recent MRI? You already know you have prostate cancer. Sorry. Had to wait for my head to stop spinning. Good luck, Jim",

      "Content": "My only cystoscopy had nothing to do with my prostate cancer. In 2008 and 2014, I had a kidney stone block my left ureter -- horrible, horribly painful -- and had to have surgery to have it removed (two nights in hospital -- fun, fun, fun). After each surgery, standard procedure is to place a stent in the ureter that must remain in place for 7 to 10 days to prevent it from collapsing. In 2008, the stent caused me to have significant pain. Couldn't wait to get it out. In 2014, three days after surgery, I awoke at home to find that I could not urinate. Not a drop. Very scary. I had visions of my bladder expanding and exploding. Called the uro and he had me come to the office where he used a temporary catheter to clear the blockage. On the fifth day after surgery, the same thing happened. No pain but couldn't pee. Back to the office where he started to insert the cystoscope. I started moaning. He said \"What's wrong?\". I said I was scared to death something very bad was about to happen. He put the scope in -- no pain at all, just a weird feeling. He cleared the blockage, then removed the scope and went back in and removed the stent. Also, no pain or discomfort after the procedure. All in all, I found the cystoscopy to be a piece of cake. Hope you have the same experience.",

You have no monopoly on scared -- few of us can say we weren't afraid but it's a necessary evil -- you need the biopsy. It's nothing more than a diagnostic test, just as the PSA test is diagnostic and you didn't hesitate there. Complications arise in a very small percentage of biopsies. On the other hand, there is no debate about the fact that this can be a deadly disease but it's nearly 100% curable when found early and treated. Thirty thousand men die in the U.S. every year from prostate cancer. Don't be one of them. Your urologist went to medical school for a zillion years and he got it right. You need the biopsy. NOTE: A 3T MRI is performed in SUPPORY of a biopsy, not an opportunity to REJECT a biopsy which has ALREADY been determined is needed. Best of luck, Jim",

I immediately cancelled my membership in AARP, because PSA tests helped to save my life TWICE (primary and secondary PC) and I will not associate myself with any asshole doctor who publically makes comments that can cost the lives of patients. Since 1992, when PSA tests first became widely available, death by prostate cancer has fallen 44%. Government panels are only interested in saving money by reducing or eliminating testing (including recommending no mammograms for women before age 50) and the many dead bodies created by such mindlessness are simply collateral damage to them.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman I would like to correct a fallacy that's been stated here a number of times.. It is incorrect to say that surgery cannot be done after radiation. There are surgeons who do it, and some specialize in it. For example. The surgeons at MSKCC do it. Specifically, Dr James Eastham, you can go to his website and see that it's an area that he specializes in. It is clearly more difficult after radiation, and side effects Alan be more severe, but it can be done. Called Salvage surgery. I discussed this with my RO, in our consult. Also, there are other alternatives if brachybor EBRT fail, such as cryosurgery, and other treatments . So to say surgery is not an option after radiation is not correct. It's not as straightforward , but can be and is, done. Also, in my consult with the RO at MSKCC, he explained that salvage radiation, after failed surgery, is only successful 50% of the time. Two pints of contention: Whenever the discussion of not being able to have surgery after radiation, most members, including me, use the term \"rarely\". That's because only a handful of surgeons across the country will attempt it and most patients would have to fly to a strange city to be treated by a doctor whom they've never seen before. After the hospital stay, short-term recovery will be in a local hotel/motel before flying back home. Then what happens if there are complications once you return home? No local doctor is going to want to resolve problems created by a high-risk out-of-town surgery. And to say that salvage radiation is only successful 50% of the time is factually incorrect.",

I immediately cancelled my membership in AARP, because PSA tests helped to save my life TWICE (primary and secondary PC) and I will not associate myself with any asshole doctor who publically makes comments that can cost the lives of patients. Since 1992, when PSA tests first became widely available, death by prostate cancer has fallen 44%. Government panels are only interested in saving money by reducing or eliminating testing (including recommending no mammograms for women before age 50) and the many dead bodies created by such mindlessness are simply collateral damage to them.",

      "Content": "Hi George: I'm a little confused by your post where you identified \"Final Surgical Pathology Report\" which indicates that surgery has taken place. Then, you mentioned a PET Scan to determine if the cancer has spread. I could be wrong but my experience has been that the scan has normally been performed before surgery because if the cancer has metastasized, there is no surgery. As you are almost certainly aware by now, a Gleason score of 10 represents an advanced aggressive form of prostate cancer. Certainly, if your Dad is comfortable with you being present, I would strongly encourage you to join him for the doctor's consultation. Rather than provide a long list of questions to ask the doctor on this page, I recommend you simply Google a request for prostate questions on any reputable cancer website and print it out and bring it with you. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Mike: Over the years, patients always seem to be in a rush to get their first post-surgery PSA result and it can often be misleading. At six weeks post-surgery, your PSA of 1.1 is certainly not undetectable, but it may not tell the whole story. History has shown that the PSA reading at 3 months post-surgery is a more reliable number. With that said, it is not intended to minimize the G8-9 you are dealing with and the anticipated follow-up radiation and HT. My salvage radiation is nearly 4 years in the rear-view mirror and, although I was G7, my PSA remains at 0.00. So, a successful outcome IS possible. For how long? Who knows? Best of luck, Jim",

On the contrary, it's the detail that helps guide others on this site who may still be in the decision stage as to how to move ahead in the treatment of prostate cancer. All information is valued and appreciated. I'm sorry you have had such a difficult family and personal history that included thyroid cancer. Under the category \"Misery loves company\", next month it looks like I'll be needing a biopsy of the thyroid too, to determine whether some suspicious growths are cancerous. I have come to view cancer overall as equivalent to the carnival game called \"Whack a Mole\". No sooner do you knock it down with a large mallet, the damn stuff pops up somewhere else. For the time being, at least, I am able to sign all of my e-mails with the post-script \"I'm still here\". Wishing you the best of luck, Jim",

It may be a waste of time, however, I would explore legal action since the doctor DOES bear a certain responsibility to protect his/her patients against this type of back-door scam.

      "Content": "While I agree with everything Chuck said, I'd just like to add (as I often do) that if you experience a recurrence after primary treatment, if you choose surgery, you will have the opportunity for salvage radiation. Not so if you select radiation as the primary treatment. That fact was what led me to choose surgery and, as you can see from my history, it was a good thing that I did because the PC returned 3 years after my surgery. This decision is not for everyone but by getting a second bite at the apple, it has, so far at least, worked well for me as all PSA tests taken since my salvage radiation have resulted in readings of 0.00. Again, best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by timeshifter That's a very modest change, and many people wouldn't consider that to necessarily be failure as above; nevertheless, the goal PSA after surgery is zero. Two main options include continued monitoring or radiation (due to it being Gleason 8, some people would use hormone therapy for 6 months around radiation). How's the recovery of continence going? The radiation doctors often prefer to allow maximum recovery of urinary continence before going with radiation. I respectfully disagree that a reading of 1.8 PSA following a prostatectomy is \"modest\". If fact, any reading exceeding 0.2 PSA sets off flashing red lights and bells and loud whistles in my urologist's office. Three years after my Da Vinci prostatectomy in Nov., 2010, my PSA has inched back up to 0.16 while doubling in less than one year. After consultations with my urologist and an oncology radiologist, last summer I received 40 treatments of radiation to the prostate bed area. This was followed 3 months later by my first ever true 0.00 PSA reading. It's worth noting that the $240,000 worth of radiation was approved by Medicare even though my PSA reading was less than 10% of Beeman's friend's reading. If the OP can wait until his October Medicare coverage kicks in, he may find less resistance in seeking out insurance payments for services that may be needed.",

      "Content": "Hi Tilly: If the biopsy comes back confirming prostate cancer (and, of course, it's not cancer yet until the biopsy says it is -- we may be jumping ahead too quickly), then age 77 may indeed become a factor in treatment recommendations. As a general rule of thumb -- and there are always exceptions -- in my doctor's group of 9 urologists, they lean toward surgery before age 60, it's a toss-up between surgery and radiation between ages 60 and 70, and over age 70 radiation is the treatment of choice. Even a person who is a \"fit\" age 77 may be encouraged to forego surgery to avoid a potential traumatic reaction to the rigors of surgery -- both open and robotic. As long as the cancer has not metastasized to other distant areas of the body (normally found via a full-body bone scan), then radiation has a successful \"cure\" rate about equal to surgery. As Chuck mentioned, the main focus will be on whether the cancer remains encapsulated within the prostate. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by timeshifter That's a very modest change, and many people wouldn't consider that to necessarily be failure as above; nevertheless, the goal PSA after surgery is zero. Two main options include continued monitoring or radiation (due to it being Gleason 8, some people would use hormone therapy for 6 months around radiation). How's the recovery of continence going? The radiation doctors often prefer to allow maximum recovery of urinary continence before going with radiation. I respectfully disagree that a reading of 1.8 PSA following a prostatectomy is \"modest\". If fact, any reading exceeding 0.2 PSA sets off flashing red lights and bells and loud whistles in my urologist's office. Three years after my Da Vinci prostatectomy in Nov., 2010, my PSA has inched back up to 0.16 while doubling in less than one year. After consultations with my urologist and an oncology radiologist, last summer I received 40 treatments of radiation to the prostate bed area. This was followed 3 months later by my first ever true 0.00 PSA reading. It's worth noting that the $240,000 worth of radiation was approved by Medicare even though my PSA reading was less than 10% of Beeman's friend's reading. If the OP can wait until his October Medicare coverage kicks in, he may find less resistance in seeking out insurance payments for services that may be needed.",

      "Content": "While I agree with everything Chuck said, I'd just like to add (as I often do) that if you experience a recurrence after primary treatment, if you choose surgery, you will have the opportunity for salvage radiation. Not so if you select radiation as the primary treatment. That fact was what led me to choose surgery and, as you can see from my history, it was a good thing that I did because the PC returned 3 years after my surgery. This decision is not for everyone but by getting a second bite at the apple, it has, so far at least, worked well for me as all PSA tests taken since my salvage radiation have resulted in readings of 0.00. Again, best of luck, Jim",

It was my birthday and friends were visiting from three states to help me celebrate. Talk about a party killer. The source of my pain was a kidney stone completely blocking the left ureter. Although I was able to urinate, it appeared to be just blood. After six hours of intravenous saline, the hydration apparently was sufficient to break loose the stone that was ripping into the side of the ureter creating the blood and I was able to pass it. In an identical occurrence six years ago, I was admitted to the hospital, my first-ever catheter was implanted, I was placed on morphine for 24 hours and my first kidney stone had to be surgically removed. That was followed by the insertion of a stent in the ureter, almost as painful as my reason for being there originally, that had to remain in place for five days. In your case, Chuck is almost certain to be correct about a BPH complicated by an infection (especially with your history involving Flomax), because the only other scenario that seems reasonable/logical to explain your inability to pass any urine would be the unlikely blockages of both ureters at the same time, allowing a small amount of urine to flow through to the bladder and the catheter. But the odds of that happening would probably be equal to being struck by lightning twice in one week. Since we are not medical personnel on this site, we can share with you only our personal experiences and can't offer medical advice. But I would neither worry about having the catheter the rest of your life nor the likelihood that you're looking at cancer -- at least not yet.

      "Content": "Welcome fella: With a family history of prostate cancer, you are doing an excellent job of keeping an ongoing record of any changes in your PSA results. But, while qualifying any comments to follow as coming from a non-medical professional, I see nothing at this point that is outside normal parameters for your age. As Southsider correctly points out, when antibiotics reduced your PSA numbers, it also confirms that the prior rise in your PSA was not due to cancer simply because cancer would likely not be affected by an antibiotic. I believe the current medical protocol is to consider a biopsy if your PSA reaches or exceeds a reading of 4.0. If you have confidence in your urologist, I would tend to follow his recommendations while keeping a close eye on your PSA or, as suggested by ASAdvocate, a free PSA test may help to put your mind at ease. Finally, try to not let the issue take a disproportionate amount of your time and mindset. It appears that much would have to change before PC should be feared as life-threatening in your case. Best of luck, Jim",

You are scheduled on Sept. 28th to have prostatectomy surgery but you are vacillating over whether you should have chosen brachytherapy? On this site, among other things, we try to provide support to those who have decided on a particular treatment. With that said, other than the known potential side effects of surgery, may I ask what caused you to focus on brachytherapy? While there is certainly a place for brachytherapy among various options in treating prostate cancer, it fits a niche outside the mainstream of either surgery or external radiation and comes with its own set of side effects. With all due respect to the doctor who quoted brachytherapy as the choice of 25% of men at age 50, my research shows brachy as the overall choice of only 2% of patients. And, if that 2% is correct, then if I were you, I would investigate why 98% of patients reject it or do not qualify to receive it. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Mike: Please correct me if I'm wrong. You are scheduled on Sept. 28th to have prostatectomy surgery but you are vacillating over whether you should have chosen brachytherapy? On this site, among other things, we try to provide support to those who have decided on a particular treatment. With that said, other than the known potential side effects of surgery, may I ask what caused you to focus on brachytherapy? While there is certainly a place for brachytherapy among various options in treating prostate cancer, it fits a niche outside the mainstream of either surgery or external radiation and comes with its own set of side effects. With all due respect to the doctor who quoted brachytherapy as the choice of 25% of men at age 50, my research shows brachy as the overall choice of only 2% of patients. And, if that 2% is correct, then if I were you, I would investigate why 98% of patients reject it or do not qualify to receive it. Best of luck, Jim",

If the lights are flickering in your house, you would accept the recommendation of an electrician to fix it.

Unlike deadly other cancers (think pancreatic cancer) that give you virtually zero options for a cure, prostate cancer is nearly 100% curable but ONLY when found EARLY and treated. Your home may be dry from a repaired roof and the risk of an electrical fire can be resolved with the work of a skilled electrician but neither will be of any value to you if next year the list of men who die from prostate cancer have 29,999 names on it plus yours.

      "Content": "Hi Tilly: If the biopsy comes back confirming prostate cancer (and, of course, it's not cancer yet until the biopsy says it is -- we may be jumping ahead too quickly), then age 77 may indeed become a factor in treatment recommendations. As a general rule of thumb -- and there are always exceptions -- in my doctor's group of 9 urologists, they lean toward surgery before age 60, it's a toss-up between surgery and radiation between ages 60 and 70, and over age 70 radiation is the treatment of choice. Even a person who is a \"fit\" age 77 may be encouraged to forego surgery to avoid a potential traumatic reaction to the rigors of surgery -- both open and robotic. As long as the cancer has not metastasized to other distant areas of the body (normally found via a full-body bone scan), then radiation has a successful \"cure\" rate about equal to surgery. As Chuck mentioned, the main focus will be on whether the cancer remains encapsulated within the prostate. Best of luck, Jim",

I always think of it as nothing more than the equivalent of repairing a part that might become defective on your car. The only difference is that the car doesn't have to deal with a catheter afterwards. But even though the catheter was a nuisance, it caused me zero pain. In fact, I took a single pain pill following surgery. Since you asked, my \"suggestion\" is to appreciate the fact that you are almost certainly enroute to an actual cure.

      "Content": "Hi Donald: I'm sure it is not much consolation but last Sunday, I, too, had severe pain and wound up in the ER. It was my birthday and friends were visiting from three states to help me celebrate. Talk about a party killer. The source of my pain was a kidney stone completely blocking the left ureter. Although I was able to urinate, it appeared to be just blood. After six hours of intravenous saline, the hydration apparently was sufficient to break loose the stone that was ripping into the side of the ureter creating the blood and I was able to pass it. In an identical occurrence six years ago, I was admitted to the hospital, my first-ever catheter was implanted, I was placed on morphine for 24 hours and my first kidney stone had to be surgically removed. That was followed by the insertion of a stent in the ureter, almost as painful as my reason for being there originally, that had to remain in place for five days. In your case, Chuck is almost certain to be correct about a BPH complicated by an infection (especially with your history involving Flomax), because the only other scenario that seems reasonable/logical to explain your inability to pass any urine would be the unlikely blockages of both ureters at the same time, allowing a small amount of urine to flow through to the bladder and the catheter. But the odds of that happening would probably be equal to being struck by lightning twice in one week. Since we are not medical personnel on this site, we can share with you only our personal experiences and can't offer medical advice. But I would neither worry about having the catheter the rest of your life nor the likelihood that you're looking at cancer -- at least not yet. We all fear the unknown and your wife is probably more frightened than you are but everything has an explanation and you will almost certainly learn the cause when you consult with the urologist, assuming a Cat Scan or MRI was performed to try to identify the location of the blockage. Please let us know your outcome. Wishing you the very best, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Mike: Please correct me if I'm wrong. You are scheduled on Sept. 28th to have prostatectomy surgery but you are vacillating over whether you should have chosen brachytherapy? On this site, among other things, we try to provide support to those who have decided on a particular treatment. With that said, other than the known potential side effects of surgery, may I ask what caused you to focus on brachytherapy? While there is certainly a place for brachytherapy among various options in treating prostate cancer, it fits a niche outside the mainstream of either surgery or external radiation and comes with its own set of side effects. With all due respect to the doctor who quoted brachytherapy as the choice of 25% of men at age 50, my research shows brachy as the overall choice of only 2% of patients. And, if that 2% is correct, then if I were you, I would investigate why 98% of patients reject it or do not qualify to receive it. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome fella: With a family history of prostate cancer, you are doing an excellent job of keeping an ongoing record of any changes in your PSA results. But, while qualifying any comments to follow as coming from a non-medical professional, I see nothing at this point that is outside normal parameters for your age. As Southsider correctly points out, when antibiotics reduced your PSA numbers, it also confirms that the prior rise in your PSA was not due to cancer simply because cancer would likely not be affected by an antibiotic. I believe the current medical protocol is to consider a biopsy if your PSA reaches or exceeds a reading of 4.0. If you have confidence in your urologist, I would tend to follow his recommendations while keeping a close eye on your PSA or, as suggested by ASAdvocate, a free PSA test may help to put your mind at ease. Finally, try to not let the issue take a disproportionate amount of your time and mindset. It appears that much would have to change before PC should be feared as life-threatening in your case. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Donald: I'm sure it is not much consolation but last Sunday, I, too, had severe pain and wound up in the ER. It was my birthday and friends were visiting from three states to help me celebrate. Talk about a party killer. The source of my pain was a kidney stone completely blocking the left ureter. Although I was able to urinate, it appeared to be just blood. After six hours of intravenous saline, the hydration apparently was sufficient to break loose the stone that was ripping into the side of the ureter creating the blood and I was able to pass it. In an identical occurrence six years ago, I was admitted to the hospital, my first-ever catheter was implanted, I was placed on morphine for 24 hours and my first kidney stone had to be surgically removed. That was followed by the insertion of a stent in the ureter, almost as painful as my reason for being there originally, that had to remain in place for five days. In your case, Chuck is almost certain to be correct about a BPH complicated by an infection (especially with your history involving Flomax), because the only other scenario that seems reasonable/logical to explain your inability to pass any urine would be the unlikely blockages of both ureters at the same time, allowing a small amount of urine to flow through to the bladder and the catheter. But the odds of that happening would probably be equal to being struck by lightning twice in one week. Since we are not medical personnel on this site, we can share with you only our personal experiences and can't offer medical advice. But I would neither worry about having the catheter the rest of your life nor the likelihood that you're looking at cancer -- at least not yet. We all fear the unknown and your wife is probably more frightened than you are but everything has an explanation and you will almost certainly learn the cause when you consult with the urologist, assuming a Cat Scan or MRI was performed to try to identify the location of the blockage. Please let us know your outcome. Wishing you the very best, Jim",

      "Content": "Getting kicked out of Medicare Advantage may not be a bad thing. Overall, the history of Advantage plans are not very inviting. I assume your former employer was paying at least a portion of your Advantage premiums. However, Advantage in many instances has such high deductibles and co-pays, it is sometimes referred to as \"non-insurance\". An example would be that my neighbor with Medicare Advantage has a co-pay of $40 for each family doctor visit and an $80 co-pay to visit a specialist. On the other hand, traditional Medicare has no networks for you to adhere to and you don't need a \"permission slip\" to see a specialist. Since turning 65, I have had Medicare plus supplemental coverage. During that time, I have never filled out an insurance form nor paid a single penny of deductible (covered by my Medigap insurance) or ever paid any co-pays. Personally, I think it's the best route to take (although I'm sure others have a different point of view).",

Old guys sometimes come back and go on to even bigger and greater things than before, as evidenced by my appearance on national television a few months back: https://www.dropbox.com/s/2tgsaqzh4a...ience.mp4?dl=0 My only complaint was that I was the qualifying poker tournament winner ($17,500 package) on the World Poker Tour beating more than 3,200 other entrants but my wife got more air time than me.

      "Content": "Hi 08: Not sure if I understand what you mean by \"your company carved you out\". If you are still employed, then your company's health insurance is primary and Medicare is secondary. And a doctor may or may not accept your employer-provided insurance. But if you are no longer working (...carved out...?), then Medicare becomes your primary coverage and you have the option to purchase Medicare supplemental coverage for the 20% of costs not covered by Medicare (or purchase a Medicare Advantage policy). If the urologist accepts Medicare assignment, which means that the supplemental insurance approves whatever Medicare approves, then injections administered by the physician should be covered. And, if you are still working and you plan to retire soon, then depending on the extent of the injection costs, you may want to expedite your retirement in order to move Medicare into position as your primary insurer. Good luck. Jim",

I was diagnosed with 3+3 in August 2012, tracking PSA religiously, every three to four months at two different places to avoid false readings. One Prolaris Test, low risk of 2%. Two Oncotype DX tests, low risk. Two subsequent biopsied from first Bx showed G6s. PSA gradually rose from 3.2 to 5.3, brought that up with my uro but my uro just said PSA was not the best indication. Last Bx on 05/05/2017, one G9, one G8, one G7, two G6s. I think the first three biopsied missed the G9, genomic tests gave me false sense of security, they are only as good as the samples tested. All biopsies were T3MRI fused, two at USC and two at UCLA. MRI never picked up this G9 or G8 spots. I thought that the 3TMRI would pick up aggressive type of PCa but apparently not. The G9 spot was from the systematic 12 samples not from the targeted spots pointed by the MRI. akai: I share in your disappointment. Most of us would not have expected such large Gleason scores on your fourth biopsy. Most of us would not have expected the complete failure of 3T MRIs to identify areas of concern on all four biopsies. Hell, we have a new poster who is chasing all over the Southwestern states just trying to get a doctor to provide a scrip for access to a 3T MRI. It provides little benefit to beat a dead horse (the testing failures, not the patient) but have your doctors provided any explanation how, after you did everything according to the book, that this could have happened? Again, best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Darwyn: I liked your story about the counter lady at the super-store. It reminded me of when I was first diagnosed with PC and I asked my urologist directly \"Am I going to die?\". He paused and said, \"Yes, Jim, you are going to die. But not now and certainly not from this\". Next, I must confess that my directness has sometimes caused me to get my wrist slapped on this site. With that said, I must tell you that I am not thrilled with your urologist for a number of reasons: First and foremost, your PSA results exceeded 4.0 for more than two full years before he recommended a biopsy. Not good. Second, he defended that position with the announcement that you had no abnormalities in the DRE exam. Not relevant if the PSA is over 4.0. Third, he recommended only a six-core biopsy because you \"..had no other signs or symptoms \" which to me sounds unprofessional since this is a disease that RARELY demonstrates its presence via symptoms. Finally, that same six-core biopsy (even though six out of six were positive), on average, could have missed hard-to-locate tumors. Many doctors who do not utilize a standard 12-core biopsy go in the other direction and perform a saturation biopsy with 20 or more cores. Yours is the first six-core biopsy I have EVER read about in thousands of posts on this and other websites. And, to be perfectly honest, it is my suspicion that if he found G6 in six out of six cores (100% - fairly rare), there is a considerable likelihood that cores NOT sampled could indeed harbor cancer at a higher Gleason score. Unless you find a competent urologist more in step with the rest of the medical community, however, you may never know the answer to that. Best of luck, Jim",

And a tip of the hat to your husband for suspecting that active surveillance might lead to you submitting a life insurance claim. That's the first I have heard that accusation. At least you know that the cancer has not impeded his brain function. Good luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Allen: Not sure I understand your question. You're not on HT, right? Why think negatively when your salvage radiation -- like mine -- seems to be doing the job it was intended to? It sounds like the perennial argument of whether the glass is half-full or half-empty. Like you, I am 3 years post-SR but March's 6-month PSA came and went for me without a single thought that I would or would not remain a true zero. It was just a date on the calendar to get a blood test, nothing more. If it didn't, then it was time to deal with the next step, but not before. Before coming to this thread today (and since I had a lung cancer scare), I was on the lung cancer thread where it seems the latest news is rarely good. Try to focus on the positive aspects of PC. We're still here. Things could have been much worse. Try to re-evaluate the contents of that glass. Jim",

But that's putting the cart before the horse (you'll find a myriad of similar clichés here -- some of us are geezers) because that is only one type of treatment among many. The words \"natural remedies\" scare me because there are a lot of charlatans out there looking for people just like your Dad to take his money under false promises. Once he has been confirmed with prostate cancer, there are NO REMEDIES like green tea or garlic, etc. that will make it go away. Standard treatment usually consists of either surgery or radiation with both being equal in success rates but each harbors some side effects. Don't be dismayed by only a few responses today because the weekend activity on this site is slower than the rest of the week.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by akai Hi Jim 215, thanks for the suggestion. Johns Hopkins confirmed the results and also upgraded one of the 3+4 to 3+5, then added another 3+3 of less than 5%. I was diagnosed with 3+3 in August 2012, tracking PSA religiously, every three to four months at two different places to avoid false readings. One Prolaris Test, low risk of 2%. Two Oncotype DX tests, low risk. Two subsequent biopsied from first Bx showed G6s. PSA gradually rose from 3.2 to 5.3, brought that up with my uro but my uro just said PSA was not the best indication. Last Bx on 05/05/2017, one G9, one G8, one G7, two G6s. I think the first three biopsied missed the G9, genomic tests gave me false sense of security, they are only as good as the samples tested. All biopsies were T3MRI fused, two at USC and two at UCLA. MRI never picked up this G9 or G8 spots. I thought that the 3TMRI would pick up aggressive type of PCa but apparently not. The G9 spot was from the systematic 12 samples not from the targeted spots pointed by the MRI. akai: I share in your disappointment. Most of us would not have expected such large Gleason scores on your fourth biopsy. Most of us would not have expected the complete failure of 3T MRIs to identify areas of concern on all four biopsies. Hell, we have a new poster who is chasing all over the Southwestern states just trying to get a doctor to provide a scrip for access to a 3T MRI. It provides little benefit to beat a dead horse (the testing failures, not the patient) but have your doctors provided any explanation how, after you did everything according to the book, that this could have happened? Again, best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Darwyn: I liked your story about the counter lady at the super-store. It reminded me of when I was first diagnosed with PC and I asked my urologist directly \"Am I going to die?\". He paused and said, \"Yes, Jim, you are going to die. But not now and certainly not from this\". Next, I must confess that my directness has sometimes caused me to get my wrist slapped on this site. With that said, I must tell you that I am not thrilled with your urologist for a number of reasons: First and foremost, your PSA results exceeded 4.0 for more than two full years before he recommended a biopsy. Not good. Second, he defended that position with the announcement that you had no abnormalities in the DRE exam. Not relevant if the PSA is over 4.0. Third, he recommended only a six-core biopsy because you \"..had no other signs or symptoms \" which to me sounds unprofessional since this is a disease that RARELY demonstrates its presence via symptoms. Finally, that same six-core biopsy (even though six out of six were positive), on average, could have missed hard-to-locate tumors. Many doctors who do not utilize a standard 12-core biopsy go in the other direction and perform a saturation biopsy with 20 or more cores. Yours is the first six-core biopsy I have EVER read about in thousands of posts on this and other websites. And, to be perfectly honest, it is my suspicion that if he found G6 in six out of six cores (100% - fairly rare), there is a considerable likelihood that cores NOT sampled could indeed harbor cancer at a higher Gleason score. Unless you find a competent urologist more in step with the rest of the medical community, however, you may never know the answer to that. Best of luck, Jim",

But he does highlight one area that I shared during my 8 days with the catheter. Beyond whatever exercise you are comfortable with, I too immersed myself in an oversize recliner and just let myself become a human vegetable. I had the luxury of a ManCave where my wife acted as gate-keeper -- didn't want any well-meaning visitors -- guess I'm a grumpy old man because I had the attitude \"Just leave me the (blank) alone until I get rid of this bag\". On that 8th day, we celebrated with a big restaurant dinner. I sincerely hope you're feeling better soon -- based on my experience and on other posts, the absence of bloating will likely occur within the next 24 hours. Welcome to the site. Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome ddvh: On this site, you will find many people who will gladly share their experiences in order to help others and I have no doubt that you will be the beneficiary of some very intelligent and caring feedback. At the same time, many of us continue to learn via this sharing mechanism. With that said, I am floored by the fact that your Dad, at age 50, began to religiously obtain and record his many PSA tests over the next 10 years, BUT apparently took no action relative to his PSA test results. Of the 28 PSA tests listed, every one of the 28 had a reading that should have caused bells to start ringing and red lights flashing to alert him that his PSA results FAR exceeded the norm. Has your Dad declined a biopsy and treatment for the last 10 years? Michael asked: - What did his primary care MD tell your dad about his steadily rising PSA over the past 10 years? Uh-huh!! Patients are free to accept or reject a doctor's recommendation for a prostate biopsy; however, after demonstrating 28 out of 28 times that the patient \"could\" be suffering from prostate cancer and he rejects same, some doctors would fire the patient. Could you share with us what happened that possibly allowed prostate cancer to spread for 10 years unabated? You wrote: My father(Age 59), has recently been diagnosed with PC on 2/25, we are still trying to soak it all in. That's simply not true as nearly any non-medical professional on this website could have told you the same thing 8 years ago based on his PSA test results. And if your Dad was not the one who declined follow-up, than he almost certainly has a viable malpractice case against the doctor who failed to recommend action. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Davii: Very glad to see your first post-surgery PSA is undetectable and that you experienced a rapid return to full continence. You said in your first post that you're keeping an open mind but have ruled out adjuvant radiation. From among your G9 band of brothers, what has been their post-surgery experiences and are they in Australia or world-wide? In the States, \"the original reason for surgery\" on a G9 patient (assuming surgery is not denied) is frequently only Step One on the road to trying to cure the most aggressive form of prostate cancer. Some patients, like myself, experience a recurrence months or years after surgery and require salvage radiation (Step Two) to clean up any remaining residue of PC. And that's true for a moderate number of run-of-the-mill G7 cases. In higher level Gleason patients, it's fairly common to initiate AR or SR as a proactive measure, focused primarily on mortality issues, not side effects. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome ddvh: On this site, you will find many people who will gladly share their experiences in order to help others and I have no doubt that you will be the beneficiary of some very intelligent and caring feedback. At the same time, many of us continue to learn via this sharing mechanism. With that said, I am floored by the fact that your Dad, at age 50, began to religiously obtain and record his many PSA tests over the next 10 years, BUT apparently took no action relative to his PSA test results. Of the 28 PSA tests listed, every one of the 28 had a reading that should have caused bells to start ringing and red lights flashing to alert him that his PSA results FAR exceeded the norm. Has your Dad declined a biopsy and treatment for the last 10 years? Michael asked: - What did his primary care MD tell your dad about his steadily rising PSA over the past 10 years? Uh-huh!! Patients are free to accept or reject a doctor's recommendation for a prostate biopsy; however, after demonstrating 28 out of 28 times that the patient \"could\" be suffering from prostate cancer and he rejects same, some doctors would fire the patient. Could you share with us what happened that possibly allowed prostate cancer to spread for 10 years unabated? You wrote: My father(Age 59), has recently been diagnosed with PC on 2/25, we are still trying to soak it all in. That's simply not true as nearly any non-medical professional on this website could have told you the same thing 8 years ago based on his PSA test results. And if your Dad was not the one who declined follow-up, than he almost certainly has a viable malpractice case against the doctor who failed to recommend action. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Jaybee: First, did your husband have a full-body bone scan prior to surgery? If so, it likely would have ruled out metastatic PC. Indeed, if metastasis had been found, he probably would have been disqualified from having surgery in the first place. The logic is that there is no point in removing the prostate if the cancer had already spread elsewhere. Since you have \"scoured\" the Internet for info, I'm frankly surprised at your reaction over pre-surgery PSA numbers. 21.6 versus 23.6 has little or no bearing on the situation. To assume, without evidence, that number somehow exceeded 30 is unreasonable. His post-surgery pathology report trumps anything and everything that came before. Although the 4+3=7 Gleason is less desirable than a 3+4=7 score, everything about the pathology report is worth celebrating. News flash: It was a victory, not a defeat. Most patients would be thrilled with a similar outcome. While an ashen color is not desirable, has he lost any significant weight since surgery? Keep in mind that 5 weeks post-surgery still places him in recovery mode. Prior to his August 5th surgeon appointment, perhaps a quick check with a GP may reveal some other issue that may be unrelated to his surgery. With respect to surgery versus radiation as primary treatment, my history shows that I had a recurrence 3 years post-surgery. And yet, if I had it to do over again, I would change nothing. That's because surgery gave me the option for salvage radiation, if needed, and it was needed. No one knows what my future may hold but currently, the cancer is undetectable, a luxury that would almost certainly not have been available had I chosen radiation as my primary treatment. At this point, your husband's glass is half-full, not half-empty. Best of luck and please let us know the outcome of his Aug. 5th visit. Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Davii: Very glad to see your first post-surgery PSA is undetectable and that you experienced a rapid return to full continence. You said in your first post that you're keeping an open mind but have ruled out adjuvant radiation. From among your G9 band of brothers, what has been their post-surgery experiences and are they in Australia or world-wide? In the States, \"the original reason for surgery\" on a G9 patient (assuming surgery is not denied) is frequently only Step One on the road to trying to cure the most aggressive form of prostate cancer. Some patients, like myself, experience a recurrence months or years after surgery and require salvage radiation (Step Two) to clean up any remaining residue of PC. And that's true for a moderate number of run-of-the-mill G7 cases. In higher level Gleason patients, it's fairly common to initiate AR or SR as a proactive measure, focused primarily on mortality issues, not side effects. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Wayno2: I apologize in advance to my fellow posters as I probably sound like a broken record by now but I note that one caveat, in deciding between radiation or surgery, isn't mentioned enough. With surgery, if the cancer returns (as it did in my case 3 years after DaVinci surgery), then salvage radiation still offers a potential \"cure\". With radiation as your primary treatment, if the cancer returns, then follow-up surgery is rarely an option. The thing that appealed to me was that I got 2 bites at the \"cure\" apple instead of just one. And, as you can see from my history, I needed and invoked that option. So far, so good but the future always remains unknown. As far as the \"poor wife\" comments, I have an analogy from 4 years ago. After picking up my wife at the airport late at night, we were returning home over an interstate highway when a very large deer jumped in front of my car. The collision was horrific with much blood and detached animal limbs scattered across the highway. We weren't hurt but as I managed to bring the demolished vehicle onto the shoulder of the road, my wife uttered the words, \"Oh, that poor animal\". My response: \"Are you kidding me? What about my poor Cadillac?\" Best of luck to you, Jim",

It sounds like the perennial argument of whether the glass is half-full or half-empty. Like you, I am 3 years post-SR but March's 6-month PSA came and went for me without a single thought that I would or would not remain a true zero. It was just a date on the calendar to get a blood test, nothing more. If it didn't, then it was time to deal with the next step, but not before. Before coming to this thread today (and since I had a lung cancer scare), I was on the lung cancer thread where it seems the latest news is rarely good. Try to focus on the positive aspects of PC. We're still here. Things could have been much worse. Try to re-evaluate the contents of that glass. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Wayno2: I apologize in advance to my fellow posters as I probably sound like a broken record by now but I note that one caveat, in deciding between radiation or surgery, isn't mentioned enough. With surgery, if the cancer returns (as it did in my case 3 years after DaVinci surgery), then salvage radiation still offers a potential \"cure\". With radiation as your primary treatment, if the cancer returns, then follow-up surgery is rarely an option. The thing that appealed to me was that I got 2 bites at the \"cure\" apple instead of just one. And, as you can see from my history, I needed and invoked that option. So far, so good but the future always remains unknown. As far as the \"poor wife\" comments, I have an analogy from 4 years ago. After picking up my wife at the airport late at night, we were returning home over an interstate highway when a very large deer jumped in front of my car. The collision was horrific with much blood and detached animal limbs scattered across the highway. We weren't hurt but as I managed to bring the demolished vehicle onto the shoulder of the road, my wife uttered the words, \"Oh, that poor animal\". My response: \"Are you kidding me? What about my poor Cadillac?\" Best of luck to you, Jim",

If it was open-heart surgery, I might also be having second thoughts. Am I going to survive the operation, etc., etc.? But that doesn't apply here. You should have zero fear of what is a standardized procedure. After my DaVinci surgery, I took one pain pill! One! And, at your age, you are so LUCKY to have one of the few cancers that offers a likely CURE. I was 68 when I had my DaVinci surgery in November, 2010. In the exact same month, the president of a local university in my area, also age 68, died of prostate cancer. I'm not as smart as a university president but I was smart enough to keep an eye on my PSA and have the surgery. He didn't. I'm still here and he's not. Don't make the same mistake that he did. Go with your first inclination and have the surgery. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Jaybee: First, did your husband have a full-body bone scan prior to surgery? If so, it likely would have ruled out metastatic PC. Indeed, if metastasis had been found, he probably would have been disqualified from having surgery in the first place. The logic is that there is no point in removing the prostate if the cancer had already spread elsewhere. Since you have \"scoured\" the Internet for info, I'm frankly surprised at your reaction over pre-surgery PSA numbers. 21.6 versus 23.6 has little or no bearing on the situation. To assume, without evidence, that number somehow exceeded 30 is unreasonable. His post-surgery pathology report trumps anything and everything that came before. Although the 4+3=7 Gleason is less desirable than a 3+4=7 score, everything about the pathology report is worth celebrating. News flash: It was a victory, not a defeat. Most patients would be thrilled with a similar outcome. While an ashen color is not desirable, has he lost any significant weight since surgery? Keep in mind that 5 weeks post-surgery still places him in recovery mode. Prior to his August 5th surgeon appointment, perhaps a quick check with a GP may reveal some other issue that may be unrelated to his surgery. With respect to surgery versus radiation as primary treatment, my history shows that I had a recurrence 3 years post-surgery. And yet, if I had it to do over again, I would change nothing. That's because surgery gave me the option for salvage radiation, if needed, and it was needed. No one knows what my future may hold but currently, the cancer is undetectable, a luxury that would almost certainly not have been available had I chosen radiation as my primary treatment. At this point, your husband's glass is half-full, not half-empty. Best of luck and please let us know the outcome of his Aug. 5th visit. Jim",

If it was open-heart surgery, I might also be having second thoughts. Am I going to survive the operation, etc., etc.? But that doesn't apply here. You should have zero fear of what is a standardized procedure. After my DaVinci surgery, I took one pain pill! One! And, at your age, you are so LUCKY to have one of the few cancers that offers a likely CURE. I was 68 when I had my DaVinci surgery in November, 2010. In the exact same month, the president of a local university in my area, also age 68, died of prostate cancer. I'm not as smart as a university president but I was smart enough to keep an eye on my PSA and have the surgery. He didn't. I'm still here and he's not. Don't make the same mistake that he did. Go with your first inclination and have the surgery. Best of luck, Jim",

While none of us are doctors on this site, the medical protocol for your situation tends to point with large, blinking neon arrow signs toward chemo. And, of course, as suggested, a second opinion can never hurt. But I'm also positive that you have done much research on your own since your mets were diagnosed four months ago. It's absolutely none of my business, however I must ask: if you have confidence in your oncologist, why have you allowed four precious months to slip by while failing to accept his recommendation?

      "Content": "Welcome Jaybee: First, did your husband have a full-body bone scan prior to surgery? If so, it likely would have ruled out metastatic PC. Indeed, if metastasis had been found, he probably would have been disqualified from having surgery in the first place. The logic is that there is no point in removing the prostate if the cancer had already spread elsewhere. Since you have \"scoured\" the Internet for info, I'm frankly surprised at your reaction over pre-surgery PSA numbers. 21.6 versus 23.6 has little or no bearing on the situation. To assume, without evidence, that number somehow exceeded 30 is unreasonable. His post-surgery pathology report trumps anything and everything that came before. Although the 4+3=7 Gleason is less desirable than a 3+4=7 score, everything about the pathology report is worth celebrating. News flash: It was a victory, not a defeat. Most patients would be thrilled with a similar outcome. While an ashen color is not desirable, has he lost any significant weight since surgery? Keep in mind that 5 weeks post-surgery still places him in recovery mode. Prior to his August 5th surgeon appointment, perhaps a quick check with a GP may reveal some other issue that may be unrelated to his surgery. With respect to surgery versus radiation as primary treatment, my history shows that I had a recurrence 3 years post-surgery. And yet, if I had it to do over again, I would change nothing. That's because surgery gave me the option for salvage radiation, if needed, and it was needed. No one knows what my future may hold but currently, the cancer is undetectable, a luxury that would almost certainly not have been available had I chosen radiation as my primary treatment. At this point, your husband's glass is half-full, not half-empty. Best of luck and please let us know the outcome of his Aug. 5th visit. Jim",

Noticed it was undercooked in center. No worries. Hours later, experienced violent projectile vomiting. Ok, food poisoning -- just have to deal with it. BUT, volatile vomiting dislodged a stone from the left kidney which get jammed in the left ureter causing unbearable pain. Hospital ER visit unable to dislodge kidney stone. Surgery to remove kidney stone completed next day as hospital in-patient after 24 hours on pain-killer Dilauded (poor spelling). Stent inserted in ureter for 10 days to prevent collapse. Discharged from hospital after 2 days. On third day with stent, unable to pass any urine. Painful. Doctor's office visit resulted in a jack-hammer approach to break free blockage caused by stent. Relief, only to repeat the same blockage scenario on the 7th day following surgery when stent was finally removed. Lesson learned: Don't eat undercooked beef.",

Forgive me but I'm being blunt for a reason. If you want to help your father, get Dr. Pat Walsh's book on prostate cancer and educate yourself about REAL options in dealing with PC. No one here is a medical professional but you have access to the history and experiences of patients who have already dealt with this issue and are here to help. With Gleason 6, your Dad has the mildest strain of PC if the biopsy is accurate. Yes, active surveillance is a reasonable choice with most Gleason 6s, however there are a myriad of variables that come into play. For example, if your Dad decided he wanted surgery instead of AS, he is rapidly reaching an age where many surgeons will not operate. If the doctor offered radiation, surgery, chemo or active surveillance -- all sensible time-proven medical protocols -- and instead you're pursuing curry powder, why bother seeing a doctor at all? I know it's not what you want to hear and I may well be censured but you REALLY need to snap out of it. Best of luck, Jim",

While none of us are doctors on this site, the medical protocol for your situation tends to point with large, blinking neon arrow signs toward chemo. And, of course, as suggested, a second opinion can never hurt. But I'm also positive that you have done much research on your own since your mets were diagnosed four months ago. It's absolutely none of my business, however I must ask: if you have confidence in your oncologist, why have you allowed four precious months to slip by while failing to accept his recommendation? Other than the well-known bouts of sometimes severe nausea with chemo, is there a specific reason why you haven't acted yet? Best of luck to you, Sir. Jim",

Some of our forum brothers have found success with brachytherapy and they will be able to share details with you. But, even if your Dad is a brachy candidate as you mentioned, know that brachy represents only 2% of patients treated for prostate cancer.

      "Content": "Hi RILEYO: According to my urologist, as recently as five years ago, many doctors waited until the PSA hit 0.5 before triggering action toward dealing with a cancer recurrence following a prostatectomy. Most now believe (according to him) studies have shown that definitive action taken when the PSA reaches 0.2 has better long-term results. In my case, I began salvage radiotherapy at 0.16 but the decision to go ahead with it was already made at 0.11. Others on this site have also taken similar early action and they will likely add to this thread. So far, as noted below, I have been fortunate in the outcome. Fingers crossed. Good luck. Jim",

      "Content": "October, 2014 Consumed delicious, super-greasy Five Guys cheeseburger. Don't know what magical ingredient causes it to taste SO much better than other burgers. Noticed it was undercooked in center. No worries. Hours later, experienced violent projectile vomiting. Ok, food poisoning -- just have to deal with it. BUT, volatile vomiting dislodged a stone from the left kidney which get jammed in the left ureter causing unbearable pain. Hospital ER visit unable to dislodge kidney stone. Surgery to remove kidney stone completed next day as hospital in-patient after 24 hours on pain-killer Dilauded (poor spelling). Stent inserted in ureter for 10 days to prevent collapse. Discharged from hospital after 2 days. On third day with stent, unable to pass any urine. Painful. Doctor's office visit resulted in a jack-hammer approach to break free blockage caused by stent. Relief, only to repeat the same blockage scenario on the 7th day following surgery when stent was finally removed. Lesson learned: Don't eat undercooked beef.",

      "Content": "\"I have chosen AS in hopes of a preferred or new breakthrough in treatment of PC\" After extensive research and a PSA of 10, that's what you arrive at? Well, here's some data to consider: As of 2015, a person diagnosed with lung cancer had a 16% five-year survival expectation. Exactly fifty years earlier, in 1965, a lung cancer patient had a 15% five-year survival expectation. True, lung cancer is not prostate cancer but at a 1% improvement rate each half-century, very few people will be around for the cure in 4,200 years. Choosing AS with a PSA of 10, in this poster's humble opinion, is a ripe environment for metastasis to occur while you wait for a better choice of a cure. And if you're waiting for \"national guidelines\", the President's Panel has already issued a belief that men don't need PSA testing because it causes undue anxiety and may lead to unnecessary treatment. In the meanwhile, 30,000 men die every year from prostate cancer.",

However, playing Devil's Advocate as I often do (not to be confused with my respected forum brother ASAdvocate -- I'm highly jealous of Sweden, btw, with their disproportionate supply of hot blondes), I would like to mention two caveats: First, the initial Gleason score may not tell the whole story if there are higher-Gleason score critters still hiding in his prostate; Second, and this is a big one, many doctors prefer to not perform surgery on prostate cancer patients after roughly age 70 and depending upon the overall health of the patient.

      "Content": "Hi RILEYO: According to my urologist, as recently as five years ago, many doctors waited until the PSA hit 0.5 before triggering action toward dealing with a cancer recurrence following a prostatectomy. Most now believe (according to him) studies have shown that definitive action taken when the PSA reaches 0.2 has better long-term results. In my case, I began salvage radiotherapy at 0.16 but the decision to go ahead with it was already made at 0.11. Others on this site have also taken similar early action and they will likely add to this thread. So far, as noted below, I have been fortunate in the outcome. Fingers crossed. Good luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome, David: I'm sorry to hear of your difficulties with the VA. However, yours is a cautionary tale of not getting PSA tests that could be avoided and the message should shine as a bright blinking red light to others who find themselves in the same situation. You repeatedly refer to the fact that \"they\", meaning the VA, failed to provide PSA tests which is (allegedly) the reason that your prostate cancer was allowed to grow. Newporter points out that the federal government stopped providing PSA testing several years ago. So, what is a VA patient to do? Answer (for all current VA patients): Get an annual PSA test and, since it is not a major expense, pay for it yourself. Only YOU can adequately take care of you. You've had a tough time, David. I wish you well and thank you for your service. Jim",

I ask that question because if you are leaning at any time in the future to receiving primary treatment (surgery or radiation), then you should be cognitive of the fact that many doctors prefer to not perform surgery after the patient reaches roughly age 70. So, if you are approaching that stage, you have many options to consider moving forward. If AS is working for you, fine. But keep in mind that AS will never make the confirmed cancer disappear.

      "Content": "Hi Sheldon: Welcome and sorry you have to be here. There may be several reasons why your PSA is at 0.91 only 5 months after a prostatectomy. The doctor on Tuesday may be able to pin down an explanation. If your surgery margins (a surgical pathology report would help us understand your issue better) were positive as mine were, the remaining cancer may have to be addressed with salvage radiation. My prostate cancer took 3 years to return but my urologist just shrugged and said, \"No problem. We'll just go in with radiation and clean this up\". He spoke as if he had forgotten to wash a couple of dishes while hand washing a larger number of dishes. As you can see from my history/signature, so far it has worked out well for me. Could this be your future? Don't know but it's certainly possible. Please get back to us with the doctor's opinion and we will try to provide info relative to our real-time experiences. Best of luck.

      "Content": "The first question can only be answered by the doctor who performed the biopsy. Since an MRI guided biopsy was not available in your area (and keep in mind that none of us are medical professionals), then it would appear that the full benefit of the 3T MRI could not be employed. Also, the fact that \"...3 prostate expert radiologists reviewed your MRI...\" and did not find the low-level G6 is not surprising because the 3T MRI is only \"suggestive\" of where cancer may be present. The biopsy is the only current device that is \"definitive\" of the presence of cancer and, even then, it can -- and often does -- miss areas that may have the same G6 or higher, simply because of the small portion of the prostate removed for study. You didn't mention your age or your previous PSA results that could be indicative of something more serious than the low-level G6 found. For the moment, and without additional info, I think most of us would agree with ASAdvocate that you show no need yet for interventional action. Keep a close watch on your next PSA tests.",

      "Content": "Hi Allen: How low is the pain in your \"lower\" region? Groin area or higher? Seven times in the last seven years, I have experienced a sharp stabbing pain in the lower left quadrant. The difference between your issue and mine is that my pain never subsided. They were kidney stones jammed in the left ureter. Worst pain I've ever had. Twice had to have surgery to remove the stones (2008 & 2014) which included the necessity to implant a long stent in the ureter for 2 weeks each time following the surgery. Then, last year, bad things happened with the stent twice. In my case, the offending kidney stones only showed up on a Cat Scan, not an ultrasound. In your case, it's possible the blood could be caused by stone(s) tearing up the inside of your ureter on their way to the exit. BUT, with no medical training, I can only speculate. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Tom: You'll be hearing from many other members shortly. Your age tends to point toward surgery, which you have likely discovered. As Chuck asked, is there some specific reason (scar tissue or hernia, etc.) that would lead you to select open surgery instead of robotic? On this site, I think you will find an admitted bias toward surgery versus radiation and a subset of patients who favor robotic over open surgery. DaVinci robotic surgery is long past any experimental stage if that is a concern. Everyone should press for a highly experienced surgeon but the fact that you reference your local surgeon has been performing open surgery since 1973 is not necessarily (in my humble estimation) a \"good\" thing as he may be averse to accepting and learning new procedures. I see you live in a small town. Is it possible that the DaVinci machine is not available to you in your immediate area? The \"gold standard\" open surgery you describe, while equally effective, has a longer and more painful recovery period. You will be well served to hear the stories and histories of both series of patients. Best of luck. Jim",

As Chuck asked, is there some specific reason (scar tissue or hernia, etc.) that would lead you to select open surgery instead of robotic? On this site, I think you will find an admitted bias toward surgery versus radiation and a subset of patients who favor robotic over open surgery. DaVinci robotic surgery is long past any experimental stage if that is a concern. Everyone should press for a highly experienced surgeon but the fact that you reference your local surgeon has been performing open surgery since 1973 is not necessarily (in my humble estimation) a \"good\" thing as he may be averse to accepting and learning new procedures. I see you live in a small town. Is it possible that the DaVinci machine is not available to you in your immediate area? The \"gold standard\" open surgery you describe, while equally effective, has a longer and more painful recovery period.

      "Content": "Hi Allen: How low is the pain in your \"lower\" region? Groin area or higher? Seven times in the last seven years, I have experienced a sharp stabbing pain in the lower left quadrant. The difference between your issue and mine is that my pain never subsided. They were kidney stones jammed in the left ureter. Worst pain I've ever had. Twice had to have surgery to remove the stones (2008 & 2014) which included the necessity to implant a long stent in the ureter for 2 weeks each time following the surgery. Then, last year, bad things happened with the stent twice. In my case, the offending kidney stones only showed up on a Cat Scan, not an ultrasound. In your case, it's possible the blood could be caused by stone(s) tearing up the inside of your ureter on their way to the exit. BUT, with no medical training, I can only speculate. Best of luck, Jim",

It was only a few years ago that the point of alarm for the recurrence of prostate cancer following a prostatectomy was a PSA of 0.5. You mention 0.2 as being a \"warning level\" but that number, depending on your doctor, could easily be outdated. When I was referred to an oncology radiologist last year for salvage radiation, the trigger was when my PSA passed 0.1. Please see my history/signature below. Others on this site have also had SR based on their PSA exceeding 0.1, so you are certainly correct to keep an eye on it. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Michele: I concur completely with Chuck and Pratoman. While your Dad had radiation as a primary prostate cancer treatment followed by brachy, my experience with radiation came three years after a robotic prostatectomy, which is referred to as salvage radiotherapy. I apologize if I sound like a Monday morning quarterback but one area of your Dad's history jumps out at me. In May, 2014, when his PSA level returned to a reading of 7, did that not trigger any concerns from his uro at that time? Was there any mention of trying hormone therapy then or did he just say \"Let's wait another year for another PSA test.\"? Wishing you and your Dad the best possible outcome, please let us know the next step you pursue. We will be glad to share our experiences which, hopefully, will be helpful. And any info you provide may be of assistance to others. Jim",

      "Content": "I view the PSA as having saved my life, not once, but twice. First, it alerted my uro to do a biopsy which led to surgery and secondly, it was the PSA that raised a red flag that my PC had returned 3 years post-surgery which led to salvage radiation. The Federal Panel that denounces PSA testing, as causing unnecessary anxiety, claims that only one life is saved for every one thousand PSA tests given and, therefore, is not a prudent use of limited resources. My retort is that, if you accept their numbers, for every one million PSA tests given, ONE THOUSAND LIVES are saved. And, IMHO, anytime you can save ONE THOUSAND LIVES, that's a good thing and screw the costs. Just one old guy's opinion.",

      "Content": "Hi Tom: You'll be hearing from many other members shortly. Your age tends to point toward surgery, which you have likely discovered. As Chuck asked, is there some specific reason (scar tissue or hernia, etc.) that would lead you to select open surgery instead of robotic? On this site, I think you will find an admitted bias toward surgery versus radiation and a subset of patients who favor robotic over open surgery. DaVinci robotic surgery is long past any experimental stage if that is a concern. Everyone should press for a highly experienced surgeon but the fact that you reference your local surgeon has been performing open surgery since 1973 is not necessarily (in my humble estimation) a \"good\" thing as he may be averse to accepting and learning new procedures. I see you live in a small town. Is it possible that the DaVinci machine is not available to you in your immediate area? The \"gold standard\" open surgery you describe, while equally effective, has a longer and more painful recovery period. You will be well served to hear the stories and histories of both series of patients. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Lu: My investigation into Cyberknife and its sister applications - Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) - shows that it seems to be most beneficial to patients with other forms of cancer who have definitive tumors that can be targeted, not so much with prostate cancer that may be diffuse. On another front, Cyberknife uses advertising that implies people who elect to have primary radiation (30 to 40 sessions - the gold standard for decades) are idiots while Cyberknife patients only have to receive 5 treatments, on average. This is accomplished by receiving massive doses of radiation via Cyberknife that does not always end well. I personally know two patients - both in Florida - who experienced radiation burns from Cyberknife that penetrated the anal walls and has remained painful. And, finally, a simple Google search of prostate cancer patients who received all available forms of treatment will show Cyberknife patients were the LEAST satisfied with their outcomes. Please don't take my word for it -- it's easily accessible. So, you are correct about what appears to be a majority of posters who are biased toward surgery and the info contained above could very likely be at least one reason why that is so.

      "Content": "The first question can only be answered by the doctor who performed the biopsy. Since an MRI guided biopsy was not available in your area (and keep in mind that none of us are medical professionals), then it would appear that the full benefit of the 3T MRI could not be employed. Also, the fact that \"...3 prostate expert radiologists reviewed your MRI...\" and did not find the low-level G6 is not surprising because the 3T MRI is only \"suggestive\" of where cancer may be present. The biopsy is the only current device that is \"definitive\" of the presence of cancer and, even then, it can -- and often does -- miss areas that may have the same G6 or higher, simply because of the small portion of the prostate removed for study. You didn't mention your age or your previous PSA results that could be indicative of something more serious than the low-level G6 found. For the moment, and without additional info, I think most of us would agree with ASAdvocate that you show no need yet for interventional action. Keep a close watch on your next PSA tests.",

      "Content": "I view the PSA as having saved my life, not once, but twice. First, it alerted my uro to do a biopsy which led to surgery and secondly, it was the PSA that raised a red flag that my PC had returned 3 years post-surgery which led to salvage radiation. The Federal Panel that denounces PSA testing, as causing unnecessary anxiety, claims that only one life is saved for every one thousand PSA tests given and, therefore, is not a prudent use of limited resources. My retort is that, if you accept their numbers, for every one million PSA tests given, ONE THOUSAND LIVES are saved. And, IMHO, anytime you can save ONE THOUSAND LIVES, that's a good thing and screw the costs. Just one old guy's opinion.",

Just one guy's opinion. It's not mandatory.",

      "Content": "Hi Nicnic: Welcome to the forum. Sorry any of us have to be here. After reading your post, my first reaction is to tell you to calm down. With a Gleason score of 6, nothing is going to happen overnight to you. Also, that one-month jump in your PSA from 6.3 to 9.7 seems suspect. It may simply be an inflammation or infection. Can you give us more info about your biopsy, specifically the number of cores that tested positive and the percentage of involvement? While we are not medical professionals on this site, we can share our actual prostate cancer experiences with you which, hopefully, will put your mind at ease that you're not alone in dealing with this issue. We have all walked the same walk. Others will chime in shortly, many of whom have shared your same surprise and sense of urgency. In addition, try to learn as much as you can about PC because there are many different facets of the disease. Reading several of the threads on this PC site should also be helpful. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Dear Mrs. GG: In the 1992 film A League of Their Own, baseball manager Tom Hanks famously states, \"There's no crying in baseball\". The same is true with Gleason 7. Please -- please -- no more crying -- no more blathering mess. You've got this. A year from now, this episode has a 98% chance of being nothing more than a faint memory, an infinitesimal \"blip\" along life's highway. The \"C\" word can to frightening to many but if your husband was going to have cancer, this is the cancer he wants. Caught early, it has a nearly 100% cure rate. Not so with pancreatic or lung cancer. At age 68, I had a DaVinci robotic prostatectomy. At age 71, the cancer returned and I had 40 sessions of salvage radiotherapy. Today, I am cancer-free (although no one can ever predict the future). On September 27th, I will be featured on a tape from April of the TV program, The World Poker Tour, as the online winner of a $17,500 package at the Borgata Casino in Atlantic City where I beat more than 3,200 other entrants. Television cameras followed my wife and I around for a week. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcTiYiwMBh8 Our moderator, Chuck, gave me permission to post this 90-second clip. I like to needle my grandchildren by asking them to inquire how many of their friends has a grandfather with his own YouTube video. So, after 72 years, I finally received my 15 minutes of fame. But this site is far more important than any silly fleeting fame as it can sometimes be of benefit to others as we share our non-medical suggestions, experiences and support. And your future feedback will be of help to others. Best of luck to you and your husband, Jim",

      "Content": "Dear Mrs. GG: In the 1992 film A League of Their Own, baseball manager Tom Hanks famously states, \"There's no crying in baseball\". The same is true with Gleason 7. Please -- please -- no more crying -- no more blathering mess. You've got this. A year from now, this episode has a 98% chance of being nothing more than a faint memory, an infinitesimal \"blip\" along life's highway. The \"C\" word can to frightening to many but if your husband was going to have cancer, this is the cancer he wants. Caught early, it has a nearly 100% cure rate. Not so with pancreatic or lung cancer. At age 68, I had a DaVinci robotic prostatectomy. At age 71, the cancer returned and I had 40 sessions of salvage radiotherapy. Today, I am cancer-free (although no one can ever predict the future). On September 27th, I will be featured on a tape from April of the TV program, The World Poker Tour, as the online winner of a $17,500 package at the Borgata Casino in Atlantic City where I beat more than 3,200 other entrants. Television cameras followed my wife and I around for a week. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcTiYiwMBh8 Our moderator, Chuck, gave me permission to post this 90-second clip. I like to needle my grandchildren by asking them to inquire how many of their friends has a grandfather with his own YouTube video. So, after 72 years, I finally received my 15 minutes of fame. But this site is far more important than any silly fleeting fame as it can sometimes be of benefit to others as we share our non-medical suggestions, experiences and support. And your future feedback will be of help to others. Best of luck to you and your husband, Jim",

It's absolutely none of my business but after being biopsied in Feb., 2014 and diagnosed with a 4+3=7 moderately aggressive form of prostate cancer, why -- why, why, why -- would you wait three years and three months before implementing treatment? It's clear that your PSA remained low, but once a biopsy confirms the actual presence of cancer, everything else is just peripheral \"noise\". I see that you have selected a celebrity doctor for your surgery. Are you traveling to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York for the operation? Just wanted you to be aware of this info on Dr. Samadi posted on Wikipedia, referencing an article in the Boston Globe newspaper. On March 12, 2017 the Boston Globe reported that Samadi is under investigation for a practice of booking multiple simultaneous surgeries and having medical residents perform many of the surgeries without proper supervision of training, while promising patients that he will personally treat them.[1] All the best to you, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Nicnic: Welcome to the forum. Sorry any of us have to be here. After reading your post, my first reaction is to tell you to calm down. With a Gleason score of 6, nothing is going to happen overnight to you. Also, that one-month jump in your PSA from 6.3 to 9.7 seems suspect. It may simply be an inflammation or infection. Can you give us more info about your biopsy, specifically the number of cores that tested positive and the percentage of involvement? While we are not medical professionals on this site, we can share our actual prostate cancer experiences with you which, hopefully, will put your mind at ease that you're not alone in dealing with this issue. We have all walked the same walk. Others will chime in shortly, many of whom have shared your same surprise and sense of urgency. In addition, try to learn as much as you can about PC because there are many different facets of the disease. Reading several of the threads on this PC site should also be helpful. Best of luck. Jim",

It's absolutely none of my business but after being biopsied in Feb., 2014 and diagnosed with a 4+3=7 moderately aggressive form of prostate cancer, why -- why, why, why -- would you wait three years and three months before implementing treatment? It's clear that your PSA remained low, but once a biopsy confirms the actual presence of cancer, everything else is just peripheral \"noise\". I see that you have selected a celebrity doctor for your surgery. Are you traveling to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York for the operation? Just wanted you to be aware of this info on Dr. Samadi posted on Wikipedia, referencing an article in the Boston Globe newspaper. On March 12, 2017 the Boston Globe reported that Samadi is under investigation for a practice of booking multiple simultaneous surgeries and having medical residents perform many of the surgeries without proper supervision of training, while promising patients that he will personally treat them.[1] All the best to you, Jim",

Due to my history (see sig.), I respectfully disagree because the 2-decimal method allowed me to be prepared when the cancer returned and it was necessary to act.

Your doctor's recommendation of radiation appears to be on target. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men. Your insurance man may be correct that you should do nothing because something else will probably kill you first. But before you do that, you may want to ask him about the 30,000 men who died last year (and every year) from prostate cancer. If he had given those men the same advice that he is giving you, then he would have been wrong THIRTY THOUSAND TIMES. A second opinion -- already scheduled -- sounds like a much more practical path to take. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Max: You and I and Allen have followed the same pathway. Ditto to Allen and lancepeace's comments. A consultation with a radiation oncologist will likely show that your \"team\" is about 5 years behind the curve if they're prepared to wait until you reach a PSA of 0.4. I scheduled treatment (please see below) when my recurrence reached PSA 0.11 and commenced 40 sessions of salvage radiation at PSA 0.16. So far, so good. I would be more concerned with your PSADT (PSA doubling time). In your case, the PSA doubled in only 3 months when most urologists would stand up and wave a red flag if it happened in one year. The only impediment may the point at which you can receive insurance approval for salvage radiation. Medicare approved my treatment and received a bill for $240,000 (not a typo). Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "\"Hubby saw uroligist for his 6 mt check up., and his psa has risen. Every time we went it was good news, until NOW.\" Hi September: My path has been similar to your husband's journey except for G7 versus his G9 and my PSA following salvage radiation has stayed undetected at 0.00. Your comment above says he had good news until now but his history shows a PSA of 0.1 during the 2-year period after salvage radiation which is actually not that good. Is it possible that his post-salvage radiation numbers were <0.1, rather then 0.1? If I experience any rise at all in my PSA, I'm pretty sure I will circle the wagons and take the ADT plunge immediately. For me, side effects would be of zero consequences as the mortality issue looms larger. Since you favor waiting to implement ADT until a higher PSA number is reached based on Dr. Walsh's recommendation (that is the 3rd edition of his book, right?), do you have a PSA number in mind that would trigger action?

      "Content": "Hi Kamie: You will receive much good info on this site. First of all, while your ideas are certainly admirable, no diet has ever cured prostate cancer. Eating smartly will help in other areas, but not this one -- the horse is already out of the barn. On the bright side, Gleason 6 is considered the mildest form. As our astute moderator will tell you shortly, there is a saying that \"No man has ever died of Gleason 6\", so please put that thought to rest. In your upcoming research, you may find that Active Surveillance could be the best route to follow now. Some people, however, just can't abide the thought of cancer anywhere within their body and choose a route that will, hopefully, lead to a \"cure\", such as surgery or radiation. You will be advised to get the \"Bible\" of prostate cancer, a book written by Dr. Walsh and read about all of the options available. Deep breath now. Your husband isn't going anywhere. Best of luck.

      "Content": "Want to decide on some additional term life before any possible diagnosis Welcome TN Bigfoot: As a former licensed life insurance agent, if you happen to croak from prostate cancer, the insurer could always point to your earlier PSA results as likely proof of a \"pre-existing condition\" which took your life and voids any obligation for them to pay a benefit. So, you can try to buy additional life insurance but don't think you can outsmart the insurance industry. It's not their first rodeo. Waiting another 3 months, after a uro has suggested a biopsy, has the added risk of allowing the cancer to spread if it happens to be of the fast-moving aggressive (though less prevalent) variety. So, while you're trying to think of reasons not to have the biopsy, you could possibly be reaching a point where some treatment options, like surgery, could be eliminated due to metastasis. Generally speaking, if a uro says to get a biopsy, then get a biopsy. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Want to decide on some additional term life before any possible diagnosis Welcome TN Bigfoot: As a former licensed life insurance agent, if you happen to croak from prostate cancer, the insurer could always point to your earlier PSA results as likely proof of a \"pre-existing condition\" which took your life and voids any obligation for them to pay a benefit. So, you can try to buy additional life insurance but don't think you can outsmart the insurance industry. It's not their first rodeo. Waiting another 3 months, after a uro has suggested a biopsy, has the added risk of allowing the cancer to spread if it happens to be of the fast-moving aggressive (though less prevalent) variety. So, while you're trying to think of reasons not to have the biopsy, you could possibly be reaching a point where some treatment options, like surgery, could be eliminated due to metastasis. Generally speaking, if a uro says to get a biopsy, then get a biopsy. Best of luck, Jim",

Of course, I was concerned but he said there is absolutely nothing to worry about.

      "Content": "With life insurance, the general rule is that if there is any way for them NOT to pay a claim, they will find it. Granted, a PSA reading is not a confirmation of cancer but they have armies of lawyers that can keep the case court-bound for years at a time when your dependents may be in need. When that happens, a lowball \"settlement\" is sometimes offered and the dependents may be forced to accept it if they are destitute from paying their own lawyers. Specific disease (like cancer) life insurance policies belong in Las Vegas only because you are betting on the method of your demise and if you guess wrong, then SNAKE EYES -- your beneficiaries get nothing. You are better off with whole life insurance. And don't be misled by hybrid policies like \"variable life\" and \"universal life\" and other types. There are only two kinds of life insurance: whole life and term life -- everything else is the same with slight add-ons, including \"investment\" products that have no relationship to life insurance. BTW, even if you can afford the premium for term insurance at your present age of 59, you will find that (should you live), it will quickly become cost-prohibitive. Term life insurance is ideal for a young family with kids to raise because it provides about seven times the face value of an ordinary life policy for the same premium dollar. However, as one approaches around age 60 and slightly older, term life premiums become painfully expensive to the point where most policyholders must let it lapse. Good luck, Jim",

      "Content": "\"Hubby saw uroligist for his 6 mt check up., and his psa has risen. Every time we went it was good news, until NOW.\" Hi September: My path has been similar to your husband's journey except for G7 versus his G9 and my PSA following salvage radiation has stayed undetected at 0.00. Your comment above says he had good news until now but his history shows a PSA of 0.1 during the 2-year period after salvage radiation which is actually not that good. Is it possible that his post-salvage radiation numbers were <0.1, rather then 0.1? If I experience any rise at all in my PSA, I'm pretty sure I will circle the wagons and take the ADT plunge immediately. For me, side effects would be of zero consequences as the mortality issue looms larger. Since you favor waiting to implement ADT until a higher PSA number is reached based on Dr. Walsh's recommendation (that is the 3rd edition of his book, right?), do you have a PSA number in mind that would trigger action? Wishing you both the very best possible outcome, Jim",

      "Content": "Allen: The full bladder issue is really interesting. I completed my salvage radiation 3 months before you and the first oncology radiologist that my urologist sent me to insisted on a full bladder by drinking 48 oz. of water one hour before each of the 40 treatments began. The problem was that the only appointments available were at 8AM, during rush hour, and his office was reached via two major highways. On any given day, one or both of those highways could be gridlocked during morning rush. I could envision no way that I would be caught in the middle lane and be able to hold a bladder about to burst. So, instead of that scenario, I decided that I would arrive an hour early and drink the fluid in his parking lot. But with 40 sessions scheduled, that meant that I would waste 40 hours sitting in his parking lot over the course of the treatments. I didn't like that any better than the bladder-busting on the Interstate highway. So, I interviewed a local oncology radiologist who was located 12 minutes from my home over local roads. After signing up with the second guy and solving the distance problem and fluid consumption timing problem, I asked how much he wanted me to drink before each session. He gave me a funny look and said, \"Why would I care how much you drink? It has no bearing on your radiation treatment.\" Bottom line: My last four PSA tests following his 40 sessions of IMRT salvage treatments a year ago have all been 0.00. Jim",

      "Content": "Want to decide on some additional term life before any possible diagnosis Welcome TN Bigfoot: As a former licensed life insurance agent, if you happen to croak from prostate cancer, the insurer could always point to your earlier PSA results as likely proof of a \"pre-existing condition\" which took your life and voids any obligation for them to pay a benefit. So, you can try to buy additional life insurance but don't think you can outsmart the insurance industry. It's not their first rodeo. Waiting another 3 months, after a uro has suggested a biopsy, has the added risk of allowing the cancer to spread if it happens to be of the fast-moving aggressive (though less prevalent) variety. So, while you're trying to think of reasons not to have the biopsy, you could possibly be reaching a point where some treatment options, like surgery, could be eliminated due to metastasis. Generally speaking, if a uro says to get a biopsy, then get a biopsy. Best of luck, Jim",

Please note that I say \"so far\" because I have no idea what the future may hold. Some posters have expressed a concern over radiation exposure long-term, however with a Gleason 9 and a PSA that has quickly doubled (PSADT), I think you would agree that you have everything to possibly gain and very little to lose by exploring SR or, as newporter mentioned, a combination employing HT with a highly experienced oncologist.

But while sitting at home recovering on the East Coast of the U.S., I was stunned by the amount of repetitive television commercials that focused on people who had to \"self-catherize\" while trying to sell them catheter supplies. Although I'm not the brightest bulb on the string, I concluded that costly television commercials must be funded by a high volume of customers who bought the products advertised -- and that surprised the hell out of me that tens of thousands of people have to daily self-cath because I had no idea of the enormity of the problems.

I question because I haven't seen doubling PSA incidents noted in many of the posts. age 54 dx PC. 7/14 psa 5.1 4/15 psa 5.5 5/15 biopsy 2 of 12 samples positive 3 + 3 gleasonT1 c (I think) 7/15 psa 7.1 12/15 psa 9.7 12/15 MRI - from what I read on the report no areas of real concern. for now doing the active surveillance and will do biopsy again in may 2016. i'm ok with waiting but the only thing that makes me wonder is the rising PSA. if I use the doubling time calculator i'll be in the 14 range by June 2016. thanks for input. Welcome Thom: It's fine that you're OK with waiting but you bring up one of the weaknesses in an active surveillance program. What do you do if the PSA keeps rising? Do you wait until the PSA reaches 14 -- or 20 -- or 30? Where do you draw the line? Who makes that decision? Speaking only for myself (and perhaps a handful of others), I would be measuring the distance that I needed to cover in doing a somersault onto an operating table. But that's just me. We all have different comfort levels. I wish you the best, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Steve: I concur with Chuck. My initial interpretation (with no medical training whatsoever) is that you seem to be a strange candidate for a \"trial\". In my limited experience, I have always viewed trials as being for those patients who have exhausted virtually all other means of treatment without success. Your presentation appears to be somewhat straightforward (a likely biochemical recurrence that is frequently treated with salvage radiation, sometimes supported with hormone therapy). The scenario whereby \"...There are a bunch of bench marks you must meet...\" sounds counter-productive. If something is broken, it needs to be fixed, sooner rather than later. I must tell you that if I found myself in the same set of circumstances, I would not dick around with any \"trial\". Rather, I would move forward and get the treatment needed. What's best for the trail moderators/organizers is not necessarily what is best for you. Have you discussed your case with any radiation oncologist who is unrelated to this \"trial\"?

Welcome Thom: It's fine that you're OK with waiting but you bring up one of the weaknesses in an active surveillance program. What do you do if the PSA keeps rising? Do you wait until the PSA reaches 14 -- or 20 -- or 30? Where do you draw the line? Who makes that decision? Speaking only for myself (and perhaps a handful of others), I would be measuring the distance that I needed to cover in doing a somersault onto an operating table. But that's just me. We all have different comfort levels. I wish you the best, Jim",

True, some patients do experience less than perfect outcomes, however I think the majority who elect surgery are closer to the textbook result that you have shown after 18 months. I'm approaching four years post-surgery and although I had a recurrence, like you, if I had it to do all over again, I would select DaVinci robotic surgery.",

You must perform a thorough bowel cleansing prior to a virtual colonoscopy just as with a conventional procedure. That means if the virtual method identifies a polyp to be removed, the conventional method must be employed in a second procedure which will trigger A SECOND BOWEL CLEANSING. I find the thought of doing something THAT unpleasant (like a bowel cleansing) more than once to be counter-productive if it can be avoided by simply submitting to a single bowel cleansing with a conventional colonoscopy.",

      "Content": "Wow, Delta. I thought I was the only patient who REALLY closely monitored PSA post-surgery but someone needs to grab a spatula and scrape you down off of the ceiling. Many large cancer centers don't even recognize a movement until 0.1 PSA is reached, although I agree with MichiganMan16 to be super-vigilant as my history attests in preparation for what may -- or may not -- come next. Above and beyond that issue, I cannot figure out your aversion to salvage radiation. Side effects? I had NONE, unless you count some slight fatigue toward the end of my 40 sessions. It was a piece of cake. One of the easiest things I've ever encountered. Hell, after two barium enemas in the early Nineties, I'd gladly trade those for 500 sessions of salvage radiation. Try to relax. You can't fight an adversary that has not yet raised its head to be recognized. Just keep an eye on your PSAs and you'll be ready for the battle if it comes. Best of luck, Jim",

The catheter removal was one of the happiest days of my life -- not because it was painful, it wasn't -- because I found the eight-day experience to be emotionally taxing. But, even considering a worst case scenario, because you chose to have surgery, rather than radiation as your primary treatment, if the cancer should return (as it did for Allen from Toronto and me), then you have the fallback option of adjuvant or salvage radiation to knock it down. In the meantime, think positive.",

      "Content": "Welcome Pat: As Michael noted, we are not medical professionals here but the people who contribute to this forum have experienced pretty much everything related to prostate cancer and can share the benefit of their accumulated knowledge of the subject. Two things are of immediate interest in your post: First, with such a serious G9 diagnosis, it may be advantageous to send your slides to Johns Hopkins for confirmation. Secondly, as RobLee pointed out, an MRI seems of little value at this point. Kind of like locking the barn door after the horse has escaped. An MRI often helps to locate areas of suspicion in the prostate. If you and your doctor have already decided that the prostate is coming out, then the location of the cancer within the prostate becomes a moot point. It will be thoroughly examined during post-surgery pathology. And, again, if a prostatectomy is your weapon of choice, history indicates that more treatment may be in your future. Best of luck, Jim",

You've seen the bias toward surgery by the majority of our forum brothers.

Two things are of immediate interest in your post: First, with such a serious G9 diagnosis, it may be advantageous to send your slides to Johns Hopkins for confirmation. Secondly, as RobLee pointed out, an MRI seems of little value at this point. Kind of like locking the barn door after the horse has escaped. An MRI often helps to locate areas of suspicion in the prostate. If you and your doctor have already decided that the prostate is coming out, then the location of the cancer within the prostate becomes a moot point.

Your above observation is not consistent with your pathology report. Why think negatively when you haven't received your first post-surgery PSA test result yet? You're only 14 days from the trauma of surgery. You don't need to complicate it with mental trauma that is unsupported. The PSA at 3 months post-surgery is the test that should help to guide future action or non-action. Until then, relax. Jim",

It's sometimes best to have a significant other accompany you to the visit because four ears tend to hear more than two. Next, formulate a plan of attack. It's natural to worry whenever The Big \"C\" may be hovering but take comfort in the fact that should you be diagnosed, then prostate cancer is definitely a cancer you want since it's almost always curable when caught early.

      "Content": "Ok. You haven't ruled out the radiation but when I calculate 75 minutes each way plus the minimal time to get zapped, then you're looking at a 3-hour a day crunch for 8 weeks (often 40 sessions). If you are employed, that could be problematic. Not sure how you felt it would take 5 weeks to recover from surgery. Usually, if it's robotic, you spend one night in the hospital then about a week at home with a catheter (some people actually go to work or go out in public with the catheter using a leg bag but I couldn't bring myself to do that). Normally, some leakage will follow but is mostly manageable. Some people have a longer road to full dryness. So, unless I've missed something, you're looking at 8 weeks (radiation) versus 8 days (surgery) for basically the same outcome with respect to a potential cure. Plus, as Chuck pointed out, surgery -- not radiation -- is the resolution for BPH if it rears its ugly head. And as Allen mentioned, if the cancer returns after surgery, you can have salvage radiation, as I did, as a fallback Plan \"B\". If the cancer returns after primary radiation, surgery is rarely an option due to the damage done to the prostate. Please let us know what you decide and why, which may be helpful to others who follow in your (our) footsteps. Best of luck to you.",

      "Content": "Welcome Pat: As Michael noted, we are not medical professionals here but the people who contribute to this forum have experienced pretty much everything related to prostate cancer and can share the benefit of their accumulated knowledge of the subject. Two things are of immediate interest in your post: First, with such a serious G9 diagnosis, it may be advantageous to send your slides to Johns Hopkins for confirmation. Secondly, as RobLee pointed out, an MRI seems of little value at this point. Kind of like locking the barn door after the horse has escaped. An MRI often helps to locate areas of suspicion in the prostate. If you and your doctor have already decided that the prostate is coming out, then the location of the cancer within the prostate becomes a moot point. It will be thoroughly examined during post-surgery pathology. And, again, if a prostatectomy is your weapon of choice, history indicates that more treatment may be in your future. Best of luck, Jim",

At age 57, though, with a PSA of 2.9, which is very close to a normal reading for your age group, you may be reading too much into your results. No need to fear a biopsy, IMHO, because you may very well be years away, if ever, from needing one. If you have confidence in your uro, I would be inclined to accept his apparent view of your situation as a non-event. I share your propensity for kidney stones -- 7 attacks in the last 7 years of which two had to be surgically removed. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Sparky: Keeping a close eye on your PSA is always a good proactive and preventive measure to guard against the possible onset of prostate cancer. At age 57, though, with a PSA of 2.9, which is very close to a normal reading for your age group, you may be reading too much into your results. No need to fear a biopsy, IMHO, because you may very well be years away, if ever, from needing one. If you have confidence in your uro, I would be inclined to accept his apparent view of your situation as a non-event. I share your propensity for kidney stones -- 7 attacks in the last 7 years of which two had to be surgically removed. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Logic1 Jim - thanks. I didn't realize surgery recovery (back to work fulltime, I mean) is often only a couple of weeks. I thought that many people have significant incontinence for a month or more, and healing to do, that would maybe add up to 4 weeks or more. Would 4 weeks be unusually long to recovery from surgery? My bad! Just about everything comes with a qualifier and this is one that I should have expanded on -- sorry. With respect to length of recovery time after surgery, the short answer is...it depends (no pun intended related to Depends pads, although I found them to do the job well). As an office worker who is desk-bound and performs little physical exertion related to the job, then sufficient pads to protect against leakage should dramatically shorten your \"recovery\" stage. If you are obligated to carry 90 lb. bundles of shingles up a ladder all day, then you will want to wait considerably longer before returning to work, allowing for a return to full strength in addition to protecting against leakage. On this site, posters have documented the length of leakage time following the removal of the catheter from anywhere close to one week to more than one year. I achieved full dryness in 60 days but could have resumed work (if not retired) in about a week using adequate padding.",

      "Content": "Welcome Madan: Thank you for sharing your experiences. Was the Feb., 2016 discovery of prostate cancer in your lungs (both lungs?) confirmed by biopsy? As you can see by my history, I had lung and prostate issues, too. After a prostatectomy, I asked my pulmonologist if the cancer believed to be in my right lung was related to my prior prostate cancer. He advised that when escaping from the prostate, cancer usually finds its way to the nearest organs (bladder, kidney, liver, pancreas, etc.) before it would reach the lungs. Has your doctor related whether he thought it was rare for your cancer to \"jump\" from the prostate to the lungs without affecting any other organ? You mentioned that salvage radiation in the pelvic area in your case was \"..uncalled for, a waste and invasive\". I'm very sorry to hear that but please recognize that the practice is effective in the majority of cases, including mine. With three years of zero PSAs following salvage radiation, I attribute it to saving my life. Is your lung issue considered resolved at this point? You've had a rough journey, my friend. Glad to hear the Lupron and chemo have successfully suppressed the PSA. Best of luck, Jim",

Do you consider the PSA from 6/13 to be zero? As Chuck noted, a biochemical recurrence is somewhat unusual in a confirmed post-surgery Gleason 6. My BR occurred three years after surgery with a path report of G7. However, as shown below, it recurred as a slow steady aggression, so it was not a surprise. I also had a single margin and was told it was nothing to worry about. I agree that another PSA in about 2 months, rather than wait 4 months, would be prudent. \"What, if anything can be done if it is indeed back? I am freaking out.\" If the next PSA is equal or higher than the last, medical protocol normally leans toward salvage radiation. My 40 sessions of SR were without incident or side effects, although I did experience some minor fatigue toward the end of the treatment. Others on this site have had similar journeys with success, so it's really nothing to \"freak out\" about. One of the benefits of surgery is that \"second bite\" at the apple -- if necessary -- toward an actual \"cure\". It was the primary reason I chose surgery. No one can predict the future with true accuracy but, so far at least, my SR has withstood the test of over 3 more years. How old is your Dad? Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Tom: My doc also said to not be concerned about a positive margin and look where that got me. I was a great early believer in closely monitoring my slowly rising post-surgery PSA. Glad I did because when the time came for salvage radiation, I was mentally prepared to proceed with it. My highly knowledgeable forum brothers are providing you with the best possible advice -- watch your PSA like a hawk. As far as a genome test to \"...predict the probability of a recurrence\", I guess I never understood the logic of that pursuit when you can actually see the progression via PSA testing versus a test based on speculation.

      "Content": "Hi Goldbass: You've twice asked about side effects of radiation which leads me to believe that you may benefit from further research into primary radiation to treat a cancerous prostate gland versus salvage radiotherapy to \"clean up\" any remaining cancer following surgery to remove the prostate. In the former example, the oncology radiologist is mainly focused on a specific \"target\" tumor(s) and zaps the crap out it (sorry, that's not a professional description found in medical literature). It is this type of primary radiation treatment that frequently comes with side effects, some of which are delayed. In the latter case, the prostate is already gone and the likelihood of finding a remaining identifiable tumor is small. Therefore, the radiologist often sends gy forces to the prostate bed (where the prostate used to reside) in much smaller doses of intensity as the entire area is radiated. For that reason, there is significantly less concern about \"side effects\" of the salvage radiation. In fact, of the guys on this site who have had SR (as I have), I don't recall any major radiation problems (but, please chime in if you have). Basically, don't make the mistake of viewing the two treatments equally. It's like mixing apples and oranges. Just not the same. I agree with checking your PSA in 3-month intervals from this point on. Jim",

Of course, no one knows what the future holds. Your surgical pathology report indicates that your doctor's recommendation is on target, in my non-professional opinion.

You recognize that with Gleason 9 and the rest of your path report that you are dealing with a serious issue -- no one here will try to sugarcoat it.

However, if the doctor is recommending a biopsy now, I have to wonder whether he has additional information not listed in your post. For example, do you have any family history of prostate cancer? If so, that could be a contributing factor that increases your risk. You list \"peace of mind\" as a reason to have the biopsy. Please consider that it could be much more than that. Specifically, it could be life-saving. Keep in mind that 30,000 men die each year from this disease and it is the second leading cause of men's cancer deaths after lung cancer. Most important, though, is that you continue to stay on top of the situation. Whether you decide on another PSA or the biopsy, don't allow it to go \"..out of sight, out of mind\".

Then, again, maybe not. It's totally dependent on your desire to view the uncertainty of what lies ahead. The logic involved may be best explained that my only grandson died at age 19. No one can say they know the pain of such a tragedy unless they themselves have gone through it. Same thing with prostate cancer. No one will sugarcoat Gleason 9 here -- it sucks. While I personally have had the surgery, I needed salvage radiation three years later. Everyone is somewhat different, although hms03049 seems to have a history very similar to yours. It's OK to be a cat on the front porch. You may even run into a dog named Toto here. He was from Kansas, too, wasn't he? Stick around and welcome aboard. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Goldbass: You've twice asked about side effects of radiation which leads me to believe that you may benefit from further research into primary radiation to treat a cancerous prostate gland versus salvage radiotherapy to \"clean up\" any remaining cancer following surgery to remove the prostate. In the former example, the oncology radiologist is mainly focused on a specific \"target\" tumor(s) and zaps the crap out it (sorry, that's not a professional description found in medical literature). It is this type of primary radiation treatment that frequently comes with side effects, some of which are delayed. In the latter case, the prostate is already gone and the likelihood of finding a remaining identifiable tumor is small. Therefore, the radiologist often sends gy forces to the prostate bed (where the prostate used to reside) in much smaller doses of intensity as the entire area is radiated. For that reason, there is significantly less concern about \"side effects\" of the salvage radiation. In fact, of the guys on this site who have had SR (as I have), I don't recall any major radiation problems (but, please chime in if you have). Basically, don't make the mistake of viewing the two treatments equally. It's like mixing apples and oranges. Just not the same. I agree with checking your PSA in 3-month intervals from this point on. Jim",

Most indicators now show that the old criteria of waiting until the PSA reaches 0.2 on at least two tests have pretty much been debunked. The new threshold to trigger action seems to be a PSA of 0.1 on two successive tests (I started salvage radiation at a PSA of 0.11, followed by 0.16, as have others). The consensus seems to be the sooner salvage radiation starts, the better the long-term outcome. I'll leave it to others to offer their thoughts. Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Barbaralynn: As a life-long resident of the Philadelphia area, I can say with confidence that you will repeatedly hear the name Dr. David Lee of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) as the go-to guy for prostate surgery. He has led the robotic prostatectomy field for more than a decade and has completed thousands of prostatectomies. Six years ago, I had to make a decision to either stay with my uro's group in suburban Delaware County for PC robotic surgery or go into the big bad city. I chose the former but that doesn't mean that I doubt Dr. Lee's credentials for a moment. The MRI should help guide you toward a path to pursue. I can understand how multiple negative biopsies can be horribly frustrating. My only question would be, if his most recent PSA was 8.2, three points above the previous PSA, why no action was taken when it reached 5.2. With a ten-year history of high PSAs, suspicion lurks around every corner. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome: After I experienced a recurrence of PC three years after surgery, I had 40 sessions of salvage radiation at age 71 which, as you can see below, has worked out well so far. Of course, no one knows what the future holds. Your surgical pathology report indicates that your doctor's recommendation is on target, in my non-professional opinion. Others on this site with similar histories will chime in shortly. In my case, the salvage radiation caused zero side effects except for some slight fatigue toward the end of the sessions. You recognize that with Gleason 9 and the rest of your path report that you are dealing with a serious issue -- no one here will try to sugarcoat it. So, I can tell you that if I found myself in your circumstances, I would proceed ASAP with adjuvant radiation, possibly accompanied by hormone therapy, because I would conclude that I have everything to gain and very little to lose.

      "Content": "06/18/13 First post-op PSA: <<0.04 \"All PSA test up to January 2016 have came back zero.\" Hi Brandon: I suppose it depends on what you accept as zero. Do you consider the PSA from 6/13 to be zero? As Chuck noted, a biochemical recurrence is somewhat unusual in a confirmed post-surgery Gleason 6. My BR occurred three years after surgery with a path report of G7. However, as shown below, it recurred as a slow steady aggression, so it was not a surprise. I also had a single margin and was told it was nothing to worry about. I agree that another PSA in about 2 months, rather than wait 4 months, would be prudent. \"What, if anything can be done if it is indeed back? I am freaking out.\" If the next PSA is equal or higher than the last, medical protocol normally leans toward salvage radiation. My 40 sessions of SR were without incident or side effects, although I did experience some minor fatigue toward the end of the treatment. Others on this site have had similar journeys with success, so it's really nothing to \"freak out\" about. One of the benefits of surgery is that \"second bite\" at the apple -- if necessary -- toward an actual \"cure\". It was the primary reason I chose surgery. No one can predict the future with true accuracy but, so far at least, my SR has withstood the test of over 3 more years. How old is your Dad? Best of luck, Jim",

Most indicators now show that the old criteria of waiting until the PSA reaches 0.2 on at least two tests have pretty much been debunked. The new threshold to trigger action seems to be a PSA of 0.1 on two successive tests (I started salvage radiation at a PSA of 0.11, followed by 0.16, as have others). The consensus seems to be the sooner salvage radiation starts, the better the long-term outcome. I'll leave it to others to offer their thoughts. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Dsweetie: It's unusual that your Dad remains incontinent 15 months after surgery. Additional info will certainly help. As Allen stated above, he attacked the recurrence problem when the PSA reached 0.17. As you can see from my history, I started salvage radiation upon reaching a PSA of 0.16. Allen's cancer returned about the same time frame as your Dad's following DaVinci surgery -- mine came back three years after surgery. Fingers crossed, we are both doing well (PSA: 0.00) more than a year after treatment. As others have noted, the \"standard\" protocol is to wait for two PSA readings over 0.2 before moving ahead with SR, but it's strictly a personal decision. My suggestion is to keep a close watch on his PSA, perhaps having it drawn every three months, if you are so inclined. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "A surgical analogy: In 2011, I bought a one-year-old Caddy with a low price and high mileage from a dealer who tried to talk me out of it because it was part of his full-page newspaper \"teaser\" ad that brought customers in the door. I may not be the brightest bulb on the string but with some miles left on the factory warranty and the purchase of a long-term warranty, I figured that I had implemented a fail-safe protection that nothing bad could happen to me in years. Indeed, in the first year I owned it, I experienced two blown head gaskets ($4,000), an engine rear seal failure (another $4,000) and two broken motor mounts ($1,000). All costs were absorbed by the factory warranty. I paid nothing. Unlike most motorists, I look forward to mechanical failures as I get all new parts plus labor for free. With respect to selecting surgery as my primary treatment for prostate cancer, I figured that I had implemented a fail-safe protection that nothing bad could happen to me in years. Specifically, if I had a recurrence, I could fall back on a \"second chance\" at a cure via salvage radiation, an option not normally available if you choose any other primary treatment. When the PC came back 3 years later, it confirmed that (perhaps for once in my life), I had made the right choice.",

Most indicators now show that the old criteria of waiting until the PSA reaches 0.2 on at least two tests have pretty much been debunked. The new threshold to trigger action seems to be a PSA of 0.1 on two successive tests (I started salvage radiation at a PSA of 0.11, followed by 0.16, as have others). The consensus seems to be the sooner salvage radiation starts, the better the long-term outcome. I'll leave it to others to offer their thoughts. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Dsweetie: It's unusual that your Dad remains incontinent 15 months after surgery. Additional info will certainly help. As Allen stated above, he attacked the recurrence problem when the PSA reached 0.17. As you can see from my history, I started salvage radiation upon reaching a PSA of 0.16. Allen's cancer returned about the same time frame as your Dad's following DaVinci surgery -- mine came back three years after surgery. Fingers crossed, we are both doing well (PSA: 0.00) more than a year after treatment. As others have noted, the \"standard\" protocol is to wait for two PSA readings over 0.2 before moving ahead with SR, but it's strictly a personal decision. My suggestion is to keep a close watch on his PSA, perhaps having it drawn every three months, if you are so inclined. Best of luck, Jim",

And I did not have complicating factors like the bladder issue. There are others on this site with similar histories who also pursued salvage radiation with success.

Step back and view it as if the symptoms belong to another patient. Realize that you are only 17 days post-catheter. It is simply the nature of this form of recovery with the incontinence that you take one step forward and, inexplicably, you take two steps backward. Guys tend to agonize over this aspect -- think it is only happening to them -- when, in fact, it is just part of the normal process. Some patients recommend that you measure success by weekly plateaus. My doctor said that if you never did a Kegel in your life, you -- at least the overwhelming majority of guys -- would still be dry in 60 to 90 days (I was dry exactly on the 60th day). Patience -- as Pratoman noted -- is the key word here (I know it's not easy). Best of luck, Jim",

In fact, to the best of my knowledge, most cancers detected in and surrounding the prostate are diffuse. One example might be a biopsy showing different core Gleason scores (3+4=7) indicating more than one single tumor. A post-surgery pathology report can help to reveal the specifics of the prostate contents and whether single or multiple tumors were involved.",

If he is having a biopsy (and a biopsy is the only way to confirm prostate cancer), then you should have the information you/he need to move forward. Even under a worst case scenario, if he has to have cancer, this is the one he wants because it is almost always 100% curable when found early and treated. Please give us an update when you can.

With such a family history of PC, including your brother, you were wise to keep a close eye on your PSA results at such a young age. Whenever I encourage men of your age group to make sure they get a PSA test annually, you would be amazed at the number of men who have never heard of the PSA test. Based on your biopsy results, there are some posters on this site who might have recommended active surveillance but you have already done your due diligence in investigating your options and, with your family history of PC and your age, your choice of robotic surgery would be the same decision that I and many others would have chosen. And just to prove that there is life after prostate cancer, at age 73, exactly 12 days before your surgery, I will be flying to Vegas on an all-expenses-paid poker package after winning an online poker tournament. I keep telling my wife that she is fortunate to have a Trophy Husband but she seems more concerned that I take out the trash. Please keep us updated on your progress -- there are many great contributors on this site who will be happy to provide helpful info. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Bill: Welcome. Sorry you find yourself here. In your case, I understand that surgery may be a challenge but I would urge you to do as much research as possible before agreeing to Cyberknife. Cyberknife ads play upon the theory that you are the exceptionally \"smart\" patient because you will only have to show up for five treatments (of massive doses of radiation) whereas all of those people who elect to drive back and forth to 40 sessions of radiation (the gold standard for decades) are obviously stupid. First, among the thousands of patients on this prostate cancer site, Cyberknife represents an incredibly small group. Second, of the people who did select Cyberknife, short-term and long-term complications were numerous, primarily caused by radiation burns. I personally know two patients who experienced radiation burns that penetrated the anal walls. Finally, if you perform a Google search of patient satisfaction with various prostate cancer treatment options, in virtually every survey, Cyberknife is listed as being the LEAST popular. But please don't take my word for anything. Check it out yourself. Wishing you the best treatment, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Bill: Welcome. Sorry you find yourself here. In your case, I understand that surgery may be a challenge but I would urge you to do as much research as possible before agreeing to Cyberknife. Cyberknife ads play upon the theory that you are the exceptionally \"smart\" patient because you will only have to show up for five treatments (of massive doses of radiation) whereas all of those people who elect to drive back and forth to 40 sessions of radiation (the gold standard for decades) are obviously stupid. First, among the thousands of patients on this prostate cancer site, Cyberknife represents an incredibly small group. Second, of the people who did select Cyberknife, short-term and long-term complications were numerous, primarily caused by radiation burns. I personally know two patients who experienced radiation burns that penetrated the anal walls. Finally, if you perform a Google search of patient satisfaction with various prostate cancer treatment options, in virtually every survey, Cyberknife is listed as being the LEAST popular. But please don't take my word for anything. Check it out yourself. Wishing you the best treatment, Jim",

Only you can decide what's best for you, given your research on the subject of PC. My input is twofold and brief: My urologist said that in his practice containing 9 urologists, with a Gleason score of 7, under age 60, do surgery. Over age 70, do radiation. Between ages 60 and 70, flip a coin. Secondly, if you choose surgery and the cancer returns (see my signature), you can always have salvage radiation to eradicate any remaining cancer. However, if you choose radiation as your primary treatment and the cancer returns, surgery is not an option (except in extremely rare cases). All the best to you. Jim",

      "Content": "Prior to having prostate cancer surgery 4 years ago, I performed some extensive research on the pros/cons of that Cyberknife gadget. Now, I'm sure the device has been helpful to some people. But, when it was applied to the prostate (I didn't look at lung application), on a large-scale population survey, out of 5 different treatment choices of people who had already been treated, the Cyberknife was listed in a distant 5th place. One complaint among patients was that it was sold to them as \"you are so much smarter to have only 5 Cyberknife treatments instead of those stupid people who have 40 radiation treatments - which has been the gold standard for many decades\". In looking for a quick fix, the most common complaint was that the Cyberknife uses massive doses of radiation at each session, frequently resulting in painful radiation burns. In applying the beam to the prostate area, I read of numerous instances where the radiation burned a hole through the anal wall. So, if you're looking to pursue that treatment, I would gather as much information as possible. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Katyana: Welcome and sorry you find yourself here. Your question, of course, is impossible to answer. With or without cancer, none of us come with an expiration date. As you likely know by now, Stage 4 does not offer a cure but if you read a number of posts on this prostate cancer site, you will find an awful lot of people whose lives have been extended -- some for many years -- mainly through recommended medical treatment, which you described. Some patients, not all by any means, do have difficulty in dealing with the side effects of those treatments. Others, like your Dad, may forego treatment using the logic that they would rather have limited quality time rather than quantity of time. There are no right or wrong positions on the subject. Others will chime in shortly but I think I can say without too much fear of contradiction that, prior to outright rejection of treatment, your Dad would be well served to have an extended sit-down with an oncologist specializing in prostate cancer. The oncologist could evaluate your Dad's specific medical situation and explain to him in detail exactly what he views as the best case/worst case scenario with respect to his prognosis. With that information in hand, your Dad may still stick with his initial decision or he may be swayed to at least consider other options. Best wishes to you and your Dad. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi: On this site, you will encounter patients who have made different personal choices even though their basic medical scenarios are close to being identical. Only you can decide what's best for you, given your research on the subject of PC. My input is twofold and brief: My urologist said that in his practice containing 9 urologists, with a Gleason score of 7, under age 60, do surgery. Over age 70, do radiation. Between ages 60 and 70, flip a coin. Secondly, if you choose surgery and the cancer returns (see my signature), you can always have salvage radiation to eradicate any remaining cancer. However, if you choose radiation as your primary treatment and the cancer returns, surgery is not an option (except in extremely rare cases). All the best to you. Jim",

In fact, there appears to be no need for any special diet or particular food intake. Either way, you seem to have over-reacted to the initial PSA. Not to worry. Some of that dietary stuff sounds horrible. Have a Big Mac. Intense exercise? My most intense exercise is to walk to the kitchen for a beer. Enjoy.",

With such a family history of PC, including your brother, you were wise to keep a close eye on your PSA results at such a young age. Whenever I encourage men of your age group to make sure they get a PSA test annually, you would be amazed at the number of men who have never heard of the PSA test. Based on your biopsy results, there are some posters on this site who might have recommended active surveillance but you have already done your due diligence in investigating your options and, with your family history of PC and your age, your choice of robotic surgery would be the same decision that I and many others would have chosen. And just to prove that there is life after prostate cancer, at age 73, exactly 12 days before your surgery, I will be flying to Vegas on an all-expenses-paid poker package after winning an online poker tournament. I keep telling my wife that she is fortunate to have a Trophy Husband but she seems more concerned that I take out the trash. Please keep us updated on your progress -- there are many great contributors on this site who will be happy to provide helpful info. Best of luck, Jim",

As Allen mentioned, a GP could monitor your case or a urologist is normally the starting point in this area. Sorry to hear that your Dad and your uncle contracted the disease but, based on your age and low PSA numbers, it may have caused you to have a greater concern about your own well-being than, say, someone else with the same stats. It is actually GREAT that you are keeping a close eye on your PSA (lots of guys never bother at all) but a urologist should be able to help guide you in this area and provide a balanced perspective. Good luck. Jim",

November 8th is my six-year anniversary post-surgery and I'll be staying. My thinking is that since we're all here for just a blink of the eye overall, if I have helped only one person in those six years to step back and recognize that the diagnosis of The Big \"C\" in prostate cancer is not potentially terminal compared to, say, pancreatic cancer, then all of the hours online have been worth it. Interacting with strangers from around the world, both forum brothers and new patients, for the purpose of providing support just seems like the right thing to do. Of course, there are sometimes bumps along the way. Although I'm an East Coast guy, my wife and I normally visit California about once a year. In your area, we especially liked the Harborside Restaurant in Balboa with it's water views. And further north, twelve miles north of San Francisco, my great-grandfather helped to found a town in Marin County in 1890. I call it Utopia but the real name is Mill Valley.

Basically, unless there was some unexpected complications post-surgery, there is virtually no need to address a question of pain management because there is mostly very little and it's quite manageable. After arriving home following a one-night hospital stay, I took a single pain pill. Over the next few days, I popped a couple of Tylenol. With all of the various things to worry about related to PC, this subject is definitely low on the concern meter. You should be fine. Best of luck, Jim",

With such a family history of PC, including your brother, you were wise to keep a close eye on your PSA results at such a young age. Whenever I encourage men of your age group to make sure they get a PSA test annually, you would be amazed at the number of men who have never heard of the PSA test. Based on your biopsy results, there are some posters on this site who might have recommended active surveillance but you have already done your due diligence in investigating your options and, with your family history of PC and your age, your choice of robotic surgery would be the same decision that I and many others would have chosen. And just to prove that there is life after prostate cancer, at age 73, exactly 12 days before your surgery, I will be flying to Vegas on an all-expenses-paid poker package after winning an online poker tournament. I keep telling my wife that she is fortunate to have a Trophy Husband but she seems more concerned that I take out the trash. Please keep us updated on your progress -- there are many great contributors on this site who will be happy to provide helpful info. Best of luck, Jim",

Basically, unless there was some unexpected complications post-surgery, there is virtually no need to address a question of pain management because there is mostly very little and it's quite manageable. After arriving home following a one-night hospital stay, I took a single pain pill. Over the next few days, I popped a couple of Tylenol. With all of the various things to worry about related to PC, this subject is definitely low on the concern meter. You should be fine. Best of luck, Jim",

As you can see from the replies (and none of us are medical professionals, just guys who have dealt with our own PC), there are different opinions of your case which some may see as borderline without a need for immediate action and others suggest that you consider commencing treatment quickly. I fall into the latter camp. At age 57, if you devote too much time to posturing (\"Do I do this or that or nothing?\"), you may be giving the cancer an opportunity to metastasize. I only had 2 out of 12 cores positive, the same Gleason 3+4=7 and I leapt onto the operating table. And if you arrive at a decision to either have surgery or radiation as primary treatment, remember that with surgery if you have a recurrence, as I did, you can always have salvage radiation to knock it down.

Keep in mind that surgery or radiation are the two primary forms of treatment, with surgery recommended nearly universally for patients in your age group. At any age, seeds therapy is implemented in only 2% of all prostate cancer treatments. And, since most PC patients perform extensive research prior to treatment, I always ask why 98% of patients reject the seeds. A search of this thread shows a number of patients who suffer for years later with seeds complications. But it is best that you perform your own research in deciding what is acceptable to you.

      "Content": "Welcome function2: I see that pretty much all of the key points have already been covered by my forum brothers. The only thing I would reiterate is that a return to work in just 2 weeks post-surgery seems overly optimistic and I agree that 4 weeks (even with a desk job) is more realistic. And while some patients do indeed experience full urinary control within one month, the majority reach the Land of Dryness in about 2 to 3 months. These two items are inter-related because if you try to return to work in 2 weeks, you may have zero urinary control at that point. Pads may not be sufficient for an office environment if that happens. Your Gleason 8 should be taken quite seriously, keeping in mind that the actual surgical pathology may be lower or higher. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Moonshadow: The others have pretty much covered everything, including the reality that a hope for a cure is not an option -- something you are already aware of. We don't say that to be cruel but rather for you to know that everyone on this forum will be completely honest with you. Here's a thought: see if you can figure out something he always wanted to do but didn't -- and then surprise him with it. My wife, for example, in her 70 years always yearned to visit Hawaii. I couldn't take her because, completely unrelated to my two bouts with prostate cancer, the idea of spending 24 hours in the air round-trip was impossible as I am a white-knuckle flyer. I told her that she would have to go with her next husband (after dealing with me for 53 years). Last week, our elder daughter finally took her to Hawaii using her frequent flyer miles for first-class all the way and, while we have taken dozens of trips, this was The Big One and they both loved it. I can't really add anything to the supportive and knowledgeable comments already stated, however I would like to make one observation after several years on this forum. We get some sons of PC patients who seek out information here but the daughters -- oh, the daughters, so many daughters -- that I get choked up just thinking about their love for their ailing fathers. This old geezer must bore you with an old cliché: \"A son is a son until he takes a wife; a daughter is a daughter all of her life\". Best of luck to you and your Dad, Jim",

The numbers you reported, as you already know, are indeed serious, although the clear bone scan is definitely a celebratory finding. Pratoman has provided an excellent list of subjects to consider. Personally, I focused on Items #1 & #2. I sincerely hope you don't think my comments are too dramatic but I would press the doctors to tell you whether they realistically expect a complete \"cure\" versus an extension of life. I'm not trying to paint a picture of gloom. The latter path can last for decades with the proper treatment. Again, we are not doctors and can only offer our personal experiences with this disease.

Normally, with surgery as primary treatment, follow-up adjuvant or salvage radiation IF NEEDED is scheduled at a later date. For example, the need for salvage radiation in my case (please see history below) didn't surface until a full three years after my DaVinci robotic surgery. As Michael stated, there is no need to be scared to death. When I expressed a similar concern to my urologist upon being diagnosed with The Big \"C\", prostate cancer and Gleason 3+4=7, he said, \"Relax. Don't be overly dramatic. What you have is a basic garden-variety episode of PC that we see every day and you have very little cause for concern\". Best of luck, Jim",

It would be easy to say that you can depend on us, here on this website, as we have been through a small part of what you have suffered. It would be easy for me to tell you that we somehow managed to get through the death of our only grandson at age 19, ten years ago, from substance abuse. It remains the most crushing event of our lifetime. It would be easy to tell you that my wife at age 56, a successful college administrator, suffered two strokes that caused her to lose her job due to cognitive deficits. I might ask her what we're having for dinner tonight and the response could be, \"It's going to be partly cloudy next Thursday\". I never know what's coming next. But none of that would be of help to you other than watching people try to adjust. Respectfully, support groups may be of help but, frankly, my thoughts turn to a leaking roof. If you have one, you would call a roofer because he is the one most trained to repair the damage. With that in mind, you may want to seek professional therapeutic help to ease your emotional pain. Depression can fester, if left untreated. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Oliver: After reading of your experiences with the Russian form of TRUS surgery, a few things come to mind: You received wonderful value for your money. An 8-day hospital stay seems awfully long for such a procedure. Forty-five days of pain sounds excessive. I'm very sorry to hear that. The Gleason 6 evaluation of the incidental portion of the prostate removed reveals little or nothing about whether your prostate harbors any tumors that could remain in the prostate that may be G6 or higher. Your PSA history did not seem to warrant a biopsy but it's unfortunate that it did not because if it did and you chose a prostatectomy, all of your problems (BPH, cancer, urination difficulties, etc.) would have been history by now with perhaps a one-night hospital stay and less than 45 days of pain. I'm not being critical of anything -- just such a damn shame that the sequence of events played out as they did. Best of luck, Jim",

You say, \"Yes, I have cancer\" but you're acting as if you are in denial. Please perform due diligence and seek appropriate consultation -- and treatment, if warranted.

      "Content": "\"Urologist wanted to do a biopsy, but we did a 3T MRI instead.\" Welcome Fred: Your use of the word \"instead\" is puzzling. Usually, a 3T MRI (which cannot confirm cancer) is used as a support tool in trying to identify areas that a biopsy (the only thing that CAN confirm cancer) might target. Over the years on this website, we have seen a number of instances where a low PSA does not tell the whole tale. The entire issue comes down to the amount of risk you are willing to take with respect to avoiding a biopsy. Another MRI seems kind of pointless if it is not scheduled in coordination with a biopsy. But this is just the opinion of one old guy without a medical degree. Best of luck, Jim",

The numbers you reported, as you already know, are indeed serious, although the clear bone scan is definitely a celebratory finding. Pratoman has provided an excellent list of subjects to consider. Personally, I focused on Items #1 & #2. I sincerely hope you don't think my comments are too dramatic but I would press the doctors to tell you whether they realistically expect a complete \"cure\" versus an extension of life. I'm not trying to paint a picture of gloom. The latter path can last for decades with the proper treatment. Again, we are not doctors and can only offer our personal experiences with this disease.

      "Content": "Welcome Steve: Due to your age, you should benefit from the lively discussion of treatment options under the thread \"surgery vs. radiation for younger patients\". Keep in mind that surgery or radiation are the two primary forms of treatment, with surgery recommended nearly universally for patients in your age group. At any age, seeds therapy is implemented in only 2% of all prostate cancer treatments. And, since most PC patients perform extensive research prior to treatment, I always ask why 98% of patients reject the seeds. A search of this thread shows a number of patients who suffer for years later with seeds complications. But it is best that you perform your own research in deciding what is acceptable to you.

      "Content": "[QUOTE=Steve2017;334456]Thanks Jim. I have been taking generic Flomax since 2014. It is becoming less efficient recently possibly due to prostate increased 20% in size in the last few months from 40 to 50 gm. I don't believe urine flow decreased due to PC. My father was diagnosed with PC at about age 80. He took one $1000 pill that gave him hot flashes so he stopped any further treatment. He had to catheterize for the last several years of his life until he was 89. His bladder was fine. One of my brothers had a radicle open prostatectomy 15 years ago. He goes for his last PSA test next month. He has been in the zero club since surgery. My other brother had radiation last year. Seems to be doing ok. This prostate cancer thing is becoming burdensome to me so I am leaning toward robotic removal before the end of the year. I freaked out when first diagnosed in 2014. This Forum helped me enormously. Thanks for your input. ======================================== Thanks, Steve. That's very interesting. If your Dad had to catheterize for the last years of his life and his bladder was not the issue, do you know the confirmed reason for his daily catheterization? Do you know if he had any issues with kidney stones (I ask that because I've had seven kidney stone hospitalizations in the last decade, two of which caused total urine blockage and required surgical removal of the stones which completely blocked my left ureter)? Have you had any kidney hydronephrosis or kidney stone problems that might relate to the poor urination? Jim",

      "Content": "\"Urologist wanted to do a biopsy, but we did a 3T MRI instead.\" Welcome Fred: Your use of the word \"instead\" is puzzling. Usually, a 3T MRI (which cannot confirm cancer) is used as a support tool in trying to identify areas that a biopsy (the only thing that CAN confirm cancer) might target. Over the years on this website, we have seen a number of instances where a low PSA does not tell the whole tale. The entire issue comes down to the amount of risk you are willing to take with respect to avoiding a biopsy. Another MRI seems kind of pointless if it is not scheduled in coordination with a biopsy. But this is just the opinion of one old guy without a medical degree. Best of luck, Jim",

Some posters have mentioned having anesthesia -- didn't make sense to me -- kind of like having general anesthesia to have a tooth filled. It would be beneficial if you recognize this biopsy for what it is. It's merely a diagnostic test, nothing more. You've had it before so there should be no surprises. I know it's a cliché but you need to take it one step at a time. If you require treatment for a disease that is almost always 100% curable if caught early, there will be plenty of time to stress about it then, while recognizing that millions of men have gone before you without incident and millions more will follow. And we'll be here to share our experiences which will, hopefully, take away some of the unknown to make your journey go smoothly. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Rev: As Chuck said, a PSA reading of 0.04 seems remarkably premature to be talking about salvage radiotherapy although it \"could\" eventually lead to that as seen in my signature/history. Are you sure it wasn't 0.4 instead? That would seem to be the only justification for even making an appointment with an oncologist at this point. But the thing that would most concern me is exactly what the doctor meant by describing your cancer as \"very advanced\". In fact, I would ask for a detailed written explanation of that terminology directly from the doctor. Please let us know what the oncologist has to say tomorrow. And the very best of luck to you, Sir. Jim",

He had to catheterize for the last several years of his life until he was 89. His bladder was fine. One of my brothers had a radicle open prostatectomy 15 years ago. He goes for his last PSA test next month. He has been in the zero club since surgery. My other brother had radiation last year. Seems to be doing ok. This prostate cancer thing is becoming burdensome to me so I am leaning toward robotic removal before the end of the year. I freaked out when first diagnosed in 2014. This Forum helped me enormously. Thanks for your input. ======================================== Thanks, Steve. That's very interesting. If your Dad had to catheterize for the last years of his life and his bladder was not the issue, do you know the confirmed reason for his daily catheterization? Do you know if he had any issues with kidney stones (I ask that because I've had seven kidney stone hospitalizations in the last decade, two of which caused total urine blockage and required surgical removal of the stones which completely blocked my left ureter)? Have you had any kidney hydronephrosis or kidney stone problems that might relate to the poor urination? Jim",

At your age 54, it must have been worse. So, I shared my thoughts with my urologist who was spectacularly unimpressed. He explained that a 3+4=7 Gleason score was nothing more than run-of-the-mill PC that his group sees every day and that the cure rate, when treated early, is nearly 100%. He referred me to a scene in the 1987 movie \"Moonstruck\" where Cher slaps Nicholas Cage hard in the face and says, \"Snap out of it\". A tour of other cancer forums on this website will quickly convince you that, if you were going to have cancer, this is the one you want --really!! Again, you are looking at a nearly 100% survival rate where others may fall into the 6-16% rate. The only tears to be shed in the near future will probably be from your wife when she realizes that she may have to pamper you for the week after surgery as you maneuver at home with the cumbersome -- but not painful -- catheter. Relax. You're not going anywhere soon. Others will chime in later with virtually guaranteed similar comments. Deep breath now. Best of luck, Jim",

We don't say that to be cruel but rather for you to know that everyone on this forum will be completely honest with you. Here's a thought: see if you can figure out something he always wanted to do but didn't -- and then surprise him with it. My wife, for example, in her 70 years always yearned to visit Hawaii. I couldn't take her because, completely unrelated to my two bouts with prostate cancer, the idea of spending 24 hours in the air round-trip was impossible as I am a white-knuckle flyer. I told her that she would have to go with her next husband (after dealing with me for 53 years). Last week, our elder daughter finally took her to Hawaii using her frequent flyer miles for first-class all the way and, while we have taken dozens of trips, this was The Big One and they both loved it. I can't really add anything to the supportive and knowledgeable comments already stated, however I would like to make one observation after several years on this forum. We get some sons of PC patients who seek out information here but the daughters -- oh, the daughters, so many daughters -- that I get choked up just thinking about their love for their ailing fathers. This old geezer must bore you with an old cliché: \"A son is a son until he takes a wife; a daughter is a daughter all of her life\". Best of luck to you and your Dad, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Neighbor Emar: As mentioned, the bone scan is absolutely standard procedure after PC diagnosis and the test itself is nothing to worry about. In the unlikely event that the bone scan finds remote mets, that would be a different story that needs to be addressed separately. With a Gleason 6 biopsy, in just 2 cores, often a doctor's recommendation would lead to active surveillance. However, your husband's 8 biopsies (I don't think we have any forum brothers who can beat that number) combined with years of highly elevated PSA tests, to say nothing of the self-catheterization, pains me just to read about the anxiety you have both experienced for more than a decade. As our esteemed moderator pointed out, surgery resolved his many problems with BPH and urination. As a non-medical professional I cannot provide medical advice but if I had suffered as long as your husband has, I'd want to bring this odyssey to an end, sooner rather than later. And if surgery was likely to end this misery, then surgery would be my choice, as long as the bone scan was clean. Wishing you the very best, Jim",

He has had a total of seven biopsies and all have been negative. As he approaches his 80th birthday, he has decided that he will have no more PSA tests or biopsies. Hopefully, in your case, the upcoming MRI will provide proper guidance enroute to a resolution. Jim",

      "Content": "\"I was not prepared for the profound psychological impact my cancer diagnosis would have on me\". Zencat: At age 68, those were also my thoughts exactly. At your age 54, it must have been worse. So, I shared my thoughts with my urologist who was spectacularly unimpressed. He explained that a 3+4=7 Gleason score was nothing more than run-of-the-mill PC that his group sees every day and that the cure rate, when treated early, is nearly 100%. He referred me to a scene in the 1987 movie \"Moonstruck\" where Cher slaps Nicholas Cage hard in the face and says, \"Snap out of it\". A tour of other cancer forums on this website will quickly convince you that, if you were going to have cancer, this is the one you want --really!! Again, you are looking at a nearly 100% survival rate where others may fall into the 6-16% rate. The only tears to be shed in the near future will probably be from your wife when she realizes that she may have to pamper you for the week after surgery as you maneuver at home with the cumbersome -- but not painful -- catheter. Relax. You're not going anywhere soon. Others will chime in later with virtually guaranteed similar comments. Deep breath now. Best of luck, Jim",

Although his comment of \"probably nothing\" would deter the need for a biopsy, I can think of one reason why he might want to delay it. The soft \"nodule\" may not be there on his next DRE. If it's gone and with your low PSA, it's possible that the need for a biopsy could yet be years away. Any family history of prostate cancer? Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "I agree with Allen. My experience with the biopsy was discomfort but not pain. Some posters have mentioned having anesthesia -- didn't make sense to me -- kind of like having general anesthesia to have a tooth filled. It would be beneficial if you recognize this biopsy for what it is. It's merely a diagnostic test, nothing more. You've had it before so there should be no surprises. I know it's a cliché but you need to take it one step at a time. If you require treatment for a disease that is almost always 100% curable if caught early, there will be plenty of time to stress about it then, while recognizing that millions of men have gone before you without incident and millions more will follow. And we'll be here to share our experiences which will, hopefully, take away some of the unknown to make your journey go smoothly. Jim",

It would be easy to say that you can depend on us, here on this website, as we have been through a small part of what you have suffered. It would be easy for me to tell you that we somehow managed to get through the death of our only grandson at age 19, ten years ago, from substance abuse. It remains the most crushing event of our lifetime. It would be easy to tell you that my wife at age 56, a successful college administrator, suffered two strokes that caused her to lose her job due to cognitive deficits. I might ask her what we're having for dinner tonight and the response could be, \"It's going to be partly cloudy next Thursday\". I never know what's coming next. But none of that would be of help to you other than watching people try to adjust. Respectfully, support groups may be of help but, frankly, my thoughts turn to a leaking roof. If you have one, you would call a roofer because he is the one most trained to repair the damage. With that in mind, you may want to seek professional therapeutic help to ease your emotional pain. Depression can fester, if left untreated. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Hawk Just contacted Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. They told me my PSA has to be 1.5 or higher so I guess I just wait. Hopefully it will be at least 2 years before I hit that level. Hawk: While I have much confidence in Mayo, I would be inclined to reach out to an equally reputable secondary source for a confirmation that a PSA of 1.5 or higher is needed before you qualify for a C11 Choline PET Scan. Did Mayo indicate what treatment protocol you could expect to receive after the PET scan? Best of luck, Jim",

In fact, during my extensive investigation of SR and in consultation with two highly respected radiation oncologists, the subject of hormone therapy as an addendum to the radiation never came up in conversation. Perhaps the combo is utilized in conjunction with a more aggressive biochemical recurrence than the one I experienced.

It would be easy to say that you can depend on us, here on this website, as we have been through a small part of what you have suffered. It would be easy for me to tell you that we somehow managed to get through the death of our only grandson at age 19, ten years ago, from substance abuse. It remains the most crushing event of our lifetime. It would be easy to tell you that my wife at age 56, a successful college administrator, suffered two strokes that caused her to lose her job due to cognitive deficits. I might ask her what we're having for dinner tonight and the response could be, \"It's going to be partly cloudy next Thursday\". I never know what's coming next. But none of that would be of help to you other than watching people try to adjust. Respectfully, support groups may be of help but, frankly, my thoughts turn to a leaking roof. If you have one, you would call a roofer because he is the one most trained to repair the damage. With that in mind, you may want to seek professional therapeutic help to ease your emotional pain. Depression can fester, if left untreated. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Oliver: After reading of your experiences with the Russian form of TRUS surgery, a few things come to mind: You received wonderful value for your money. An 8-day hospital stay seems awfully long for such a procedure. Forty-five days of pain sounds excessive. I'm very sorry to hear that. The Gleason 6 evaluation of the incidental portion of the prostate removed reveals little or nothing about whether your prostate harbors any tumors that could remain in the prostate that may be G6 or higher. Your PSA history did not seem to warrant a biopsy but it's unfortunate that it did not because if it did and you chose a prostatectomy, all of your problems (BPH, cancer, urination difficulties, etc.) would have been history by now with perhaps a one-night hospital stay and less than 45 days of pain. I'm not being critical of anything -- just such a damn shame that the sequence of events played out as they did. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Prowler: Such a small change in your PSA three years post-surgery, as mentioned, is likely nothing to worry about. At the same time, it is prudent to keep an eye on it without the need to stare at the ceiling as you try to go to sleep each night. After my surgical pathology showed a positive margin, I was told there was nothing to be concerned about. When my first PSA post-surgery at three months read 0.02, I was told there was nothing to be concerned about. Three years after surgery, I experienced a recurrence and required 40 sessions of salvage radiation. So far, so good. I am probably one of the few forum brothers who advocate for ultrasensitive PSA monitoring because, as I watched the PSA number climb over those three years (please see signature below), it helped me to mentally prepare for what came next (SR). Think about those patients who only receive one-decimal test results and are stunned when, out of nowhere, they are informed of a recurrence. To put your concerns at rest, it would probably be best to draw your PSA every six months or even every three months if it will give you peace of mind. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "\"I was not prepared for the profound psychological impact my cancer diagnosis would have on me\". Zencat: At age 68, those were also my thoughts exactly. At your age 54, it must have been worse. So, I shared my thoughts with my urologist who was spectacularly unimpressed. He explained that a 3+4=7 Gleason score was nothing more than run-of-the-mill PC that his group sees every day and that the cure rate, when treated early, is nearly 100%. He referred me to a scene in the 1987 movie \"Moonstruck\" where Cher slaps Nicholas Cage hard in the face and says, \"Snap out of it\". A tour of other cancer forums on this website will quickly convince you that, if you were going to have cancer, this is the one you want --really!! Again, you are looking at a nearly 100% survival rate where others may fall into the 6-16% rate. The only tears to be shed in the near future will probably be from your wife when she realizes that she may have to pamper you for the week after surgery as you maneuver at home with the cumbersome -- but not painful -- catheter. Relax. You're not going anywhere soon. Others will chime in later with virtually guaranteed similar comments. Deep breath now. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome: DaVinci would be one of several choices if he was about 10 years younger, which is around the age that I had the surgery. There are always exceptions to every \"rule\" but in the U.S., many doctors will decline to perform PC surgery (open or robotic) past around age 70. At age 77, unless he is in extremely good physical condition, it would be my guess that it wouldn't be an option in Russia, either, because of the risk/reward ratio of major surgery (and even the robotic version is major surgery). Radiation, possibly combined with hormone therapy, particularly when dealing with an aggressive Gleason 8, would seem to be a logical choice of treatment. It surprises me that there was such a large degree of top-of-the-line medical devices available (ultrasound, MRI, Cat scan, PET scan, etc.) for him while at the same time the medical community didn't want to spend a minimal amount of rubles to pay for a PSA blood test to prevent the need for those later devices. In the United States, the federal government is trying to discourage PSA testing, also, primarily to save money while stating a desire to reduce \"anxiety\" and alleged unnecessary side effects of some treatment. Best of luck to you and your Dad, Jim",

I'm not a doctor but I have never in my life heard of spreading prostate cancer through sex. To feel certain, that's one to ask your doc. You didn't mention how long ago you had the full body bone scan but you are certainly correct that it will determine if the cancer has spread to other organs and, ultimately, help to decide the path to follow in your treatment. But don't get ahead of yourself. My prostate biopsy was similar to yours -- 3+4=7 -- 2 of 12 cores positive. When I expressed my panicked concern to my urologist, he simply said, \"Will you please calm the hell down? Yes, you have cancer but we can fix it because the cancer you have is just everyday run-of-the-mill prostate cancer. It's nothing special. We see it every day\". At one point, 300 people reported to me. Being chastised was something new for me. Waiting for test results drive me crazy, too. I now deal only with a hospital group that posts all test results online within 36 hours for that reason. Since you likely have more diagnostic tests in your future, you may want to inquire whether that option is available to you.

      "Content": "Welcome Neighbor Emar: As mentioned, the bone scan is absolutely standard procedure after PC diagnosis and the test itself is nothing to worry about. In the unlikely event that the bone scan finds remote mets, that would be a different story that needs to be addressed separately. With a Gleason 6 biopsy, in just 2 cores, often a doctor's recommendation would lead to active surveillance. However, your husband's 8 biopsies (I don't think we have any forum brothers who can beat that number) combined with years of highly elevated PSA tests, to say nothing of the self-catheterization, pains me just to read about the anxiety you have both experienced for more than a decade. As our esteemed moderator pointed out, surgery resolved his many problems with BPH and urination. As a non-medical professional I cannot provide medical advice but if I had suffered as long as your husband has, I'd want to bring this odyssey to an end, sooner rather than later. And if surgery was likely to end this misery, then surgery would be my choice, as long as the bone scan was clean. Wishing you the very best, Jim",

Therapy: Radiation About 3 weeks ago the gel was injected between prostate and colon as a shield to protect colon from radiation. Radiation is underway now. This gel is a new development ho help reduce radiation side efects. Problem: Spaceoar Gel apparently to low positioned and eventually some gel in the injection cannula holes. Situation: Permanent pain in the perineum area between scrotum and anus. Very uncomfortable. This gel gets hard right after the injection. Now it is pressing hard and rubbing permanently from the inside. No seating for lunch or dinner, no car driving. Pain is always there. Gel gets dissolved and disappears apparently after 2-3 months. I can't imagine waiting so long with that pain. Any experience with such a situation or any advice? Thank you Chuck, found his only other post from a couple years ago. Makes me wonder if it's the gel that was supposed to dissolve/disappear. I've never heard of this gel, not being a radiation guy (at least not yet!).",

      "Content": "Hi Barry: Welcome aboard but, as others will reiterate, sorry you have to be here, especially at age 46. The only stupid question is the one not asked. I'm not a doctor but I have never in my life heard of spreading prostate cancer through sex. To feel certain, that's one to ask your doc. You didn't mention how long ago you had the full body bone scan but you are certainly correct that it will determine if the cancer has spread to other organs and, ultimately, help to decide the path to follow in your treatment. But don't get ahead of yourself. My prostate biopsy was similar to yours -- 3+4=7 -- 2 of 12 cores positive. When I expressed my panicked concern to my urologist, he simply said, \"Will you please calm the hell down? Yes, you have cancer but we can fix it because the cancer you have is just everyday run-of-the-mill prostate cancer. It's nothing special. We see it every day\". At one point, 300 people reported to me. Being chastised was something new for me. Waiting for test results drive me crazy, too. I now deal only with a hospital group that posts all test results online within 36 hours for that reason. Since you likely have more diagnostic tests in your future, you may want to inquire whether that option is available to you. I, too, have found this site to be beneficial as I am about to travel on my next journey. Others will chime in shortly. Best of luck to you -- please keep us updated Jim",

Invariably, after reading a first post, I formulate a response and as I start to type, I note that Chuck has already hit one or more of the key points in response. One thing missing in your post is whether your husband has a family history of PC that might make him more susceptible to this disease. In your husband's case -- at age 48 -- I would respectfully agree with Chuck that two PSA tests 30 days apart MAY still represent merely a bad case of prostatitis. Hopefully, the biopsy will bring a definitive answer. You seem focused on the 4-week PSA movement from 6.48 to 7.22. Again, that COULD be explained as an infection. I hate to be repetitious but if you have read a lot of posts on this thread, you can take comfort in knowing that if it is indeed the \"C\" word, then this is actually the \"C\" you want to have, as it is nearly always 100% curable if found early and treated.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago I don't exactly understand why being 67 and having Type 2 diabetes would make anyone \"be pro-active and not consider active surveillance\" ? . Because at age 67, the clock is ticking, Otago. When I had the DaVinci at age 68, I was rapidly approaching a cut-off at around age 70 when many doctors remove the option of surgery in favor of radiation. And, with Obamacare continually reducing payments on virtually all aspects of Medicare, it would not surprise me if that cut-off age dropped even further, removing a patient's options unless they want to pay for the surgery themselves. So, if a patient at age 67 or 68 is leaning toward active surveillance, the \"watchful waiting\" may actually eliminate the choice of surgery as calendar months pass by. And, as Chuck mentioned, the actual Gleason score could easily be higher. Sitting around, hoping things will get better (which won't happen) would not be my first choice. Best of luck to you, Engel.

      "Content": "Welcome: DaVinci would be one of several choices if he was about 10 years younger, which is around the age that I had the surgery. There are always exceptions to every \"rule\" but in the U.S., many doctors will decline to perform PC surgery (open or robotic) past around age 70. At age 77, unless he is in extremely good physical condition, it would be my guess that it wouldn't be an option in Russia, either, because of the risk/reward ratio of major surgery (and even the robotic version is major surgery). Radiation, possibly combined with hormone therapy, particularly when dealing with an aggressive Gleason 8, would seem to be a logical choice of treatment. It surprises me that there was such a large degree of top-of-the-line medical devices available (ultrasound, MRI, Cat scan, PET scan, etc.) for him while at the same time the medical community didn't want to spend a minimal amount of rubles to pay for a PSA blood test to prevent the need for those later devices. In the United States, the federal government is trying to discourage PSA testing, also, primarily to save money while stating a desire to reduce \"anxiety\" and alleged unnecessary side effects of some treatment. Best of luck to you and your Dad, Jim",

PSA tests are designed to \"indicate\" whether prostate cancer may or may not be present. A biopsy is the ONLY definitive way to determine if a patient ACTUALLY has prostate cancer. After your biopsy, you wrote; Considering the fact my PSA is stable, ...I'm going to wait 6 months....\" My response: Since the PSA reading is designed to help \"identify\" whether prostate cancer is present, it is of little value to be comforted in knowing your PSA is \"stable\" because that issue is no longer relevant. The ONLY thing that is relevant are the three positive cores which confirm the following: YOU HAVE PROSTATE CANCER!!! IN MOST MEDICAL PROTOCOL PROFILES OF PROSTATE CANCER, THREE POSITIVE CORES -- EVEN THE LESS AGGRESSIVE GLEASON 6 -- NORMALLY CALL FOR TREATMENT. You're certainly free to wait six months for another PSA test that will be as meaningless as your last one and it may bring you additional comfort if it is lower but it will only give your PC an additional six months to potentially spread.

Therapy: Radiation About 3 weeks ago the gel was injected between prostate and colon as a shield to protect colon from radiation. Radiation is underway now. This gel is a new development ho help reduce radiation side efects. Problem: Spaceoar Gel apparently to low positioned and eventually some gel in the injection cannula holes. Situation: Permanent pain in the perineum area between scrotum and anus. Very uncomfortable. This gel gets hard right after the injection. Now it is pressing hard and rubbing permanently from the inside. No seating for lunch or dinner, no car driving. Pain is always there. Gel gets dissolved and disappears apparently after 2-3 months. I can't imagine waiting so long with that pain. Any experience with such a situation or any advice? Thank you Chuck, found his only other post from a couple years ago. Makes me wonder if it's the gel that was supposed to dissolve/disappear. I've never heard of this gel, not being a radiation guy (at least not yet!).",

      "Content": "Welcome Ready: As you may have read, we have a very knowledgeable moderator. Invariably, after reading a first post, I formulate a response and as I start to type, I note that Chuck has already hit one or more of the key points in response. One thing missing in your post is whether your husband has a family history of PC that might make him more susceptible to this disease. In your husband's case -- at age 48 -- I would respectfully agree with Chuck that two PSA tests 30 days apart MAY still represent merely a bad case of prostatitis. Hopefully, the biopsy will bring a definitive answer. You seem focused on the 4-week PSA movement from 6.48 to 7.22. Again, that COULD be explained as an infection. I hate to be repetitious but if you have read a lot of posts on this thread, you can take comfort in knowing that if it is indeed the \"C\" word, then this is actually the \"C\" you want to have, as it is nearly always 100% curable if found early and treated. A tour around this website will find other \"C\"s that frequently tend to be life-threatening and that doesn't likely apply to your husband. We look forward to hearing his biopsy results and while we are medical non-professionals (with a few exceptions), we can share our experiences that may be helpful further down the road.

      "Content": "Southsider: Maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm not reading this post properly. I keep reading similar posts and my eyes start rolling around in the back of my head. PSA tests are designed to \"indicate\" whether prostate cancer may or may not be present. A biopsy is the ONLY definitive way to determine if a patient ACTUALLY has prostate cancer. After your biopsy, you wrote; Considering the fact my PSA is stable, ...I'm going to wait 6 months....\" My response: Since the PSA reading is designed to help \"identify\" whether prostate cancer is present, it is of little value to be comforted in knowing your PSA is \"stable\" because that issue is no longer relevant. The ONLY thing that is relevant are the three positive cores which confirm the following: YOU HAVE PROSTATE CANCER!!! IN MOST MEDICAL PROTOCOL PROFILES OF PROSTATE CANCER, THREE POSITIVE CORES -- EVEN THE LESS AGGRESSIVE GLEASON 6 -- NORMALLY CALL FOR TREATMENT. You're certainly free to wait six months for another PSA test that will be as meaningless as your last one and it may bring you additional comfort if it is lower but it will only give your PC an additional six months to potentially spread. Comments, please. If I'm wrong, please let me know. Good luck, Sir Jim",

      "Content": "Theszak: Please don't be offended by my position but sometimes we overthink an issue to the point of complicating something that is really not that complicated. I had a prostate biopsy in Aug., 2010. Was it uncomfortable? Yes, absolutely. Was it actually painful? No. Cancer was detected. Gleason score: 3+4=7 This was followed shortly thereafter by a prostatectomy via DaVinci robotic surgery. I had a textbook recovery period. For decades the prostate biopsy has been the gold standard in cancer detection of the prostate. While there are always \"new\" methods of addressing almost anything, so far, none have proven more effective or reliable. If you are focused exclusively on something that is non-invasive, my advice is to consult a fortune teller. I know that may seem insensitive, but the opposite is true. I wish only the best for you. But don't take my word for it. Please continue to seek out the opinion of others, many of whom like me, have actually walked the walk. Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Joe1 It seems to me that numbers do not lie, for most men the cost of false positive PSA testing and the resulting cost of over treatment of indolent cancers that would have never been an issue, is a waste of limited health care dollars, and yes there is only a limited number of dollars to go around, irregardless how highly one may value their own life. Everyone here who has benefited from early detection by a routine PSA obviously would want everyone else to have the same benefit, but what is lost in this argument is that those of you in this group are a minority of PCa patients as hard as that may be to accept based on your personal experience. The bottom line is this, every dollar spent on the over diagnosis and over treatment of indolent prostrate cancers that never would have threated one's health is a dollar taken away from everyone else with medical conditions that could have actually benefited from those medical dollars. So, Joe, we have a limited number of dollars to \"go around\" to save/prolong the lives of American citizens? No one mentioned that to me when I spent the last 50 years contributing to the Medicare program out of my earnings to insure that I had adequate medical coverage in my retirement years. I must have missed the part where we're all on monetary rations and must make sacrifices (including our lives, according to you) in order for financial aid to benefit the rest of the world. With hundreds of billion dollars sent to foreign countries via aid packages, they will prosper and thrive through the taxes collected from my years of labor. And we can't AFFORD PSA tests to continue to save lives here? I do not share your views.",

      "Content": "Hi Rob: The information you have received so far is accurate and timely. But look closely at my history below and you will find that my PSA post-surgery jumped from 0.02 to 0.04 and I was told that it was meaningless (sound familiar?). It was the advance notice (for me, not necessarily for you) that, three years after surgery, my prostate cancer had returned. And, although the accepted medical protocol confirmation of a biochemical recurrence happens after a patient receives at least 2 PSA readings of 0.2 or above, I opted for salvage radiation when my PSA reached 0.11, since an upward trend was obvious (Jim's protocol). I had zero side effects from the 40 sessions of salvage radiation and, at least for now, the monster is being held at bay, based on my recent pristine PSA results. Of course, no one knows what the future holds. My suggestion is to keep a close eye on your PSA numbers and consider taking action if and when you exceed 0.1, not 0.2. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Steve: Welcome. Sorry you find yourself here but there are many forum brothers who have experienced similar histories and who will share their views with you shortly. Personally, my \"insight\", for what it's worth, with respect to predicting cancer outside the prostate via tables, is to use the paper they are written on to wrap dead fish. The only thing that matters is your personal case. No one here will sugar-coat that Gleason 8 is less than desirable. Your age will determine how much importance you assign to the nerve bundles and only you can decide whether you can make the necessary adjustments to do without them. First and foremost, though, is the need to survive the cancer. As our esteemed moderator, Chuck, has often said \"A hard-on is of little value to a dead guy\". Even if you decide on surgery and require salvage radiation later, I'm a living example that it is doable, having suffered no side effects to speak of (except for the PC recurrence 3 years post-surgery). I'm still here. Read as much as you can, then make your decision. We'll be here for you. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago I don't exactly understand why being 67 and having Type 2 diabetes would make anyone \"be pro-active and not consider active surveillance\" ? . Because at age 67, the clock is ticking, Otago. When I had the DaVinci at age 68, I was rapidly approaching a cut-off at around age 70 when many doctors remove the option of surgery in favor of radiation. And, with Obamacare continually reducing payments on virtually all aspects of Medicare, it would not surprise me if that cut-off age dropped even further, removing a patient's options unless they want to pay for the surgery themselves. So, if a patient at age 67 or 68 is leaning toward active surveillance, the \"watchful waiting\" may actually eliminate the choice of surgery as calendar months pass by. And, as Chuck mentioned, the actual Gleason score could easily be higher. Sitting around, hoping things will get better (which won't happen) would not be my first choice. Best of luck to you, Engel.

      "Content": "Welcome Howard: You raise the never-ending query about which PSA test is better -- the standard biopsy where a post-surgery result of <0.1 is considered \"undetectable\" as recommended by the Mayo Clinic -- or the readings of an ultra-sensitive machine that takes the number to the second decimal, thereby divulging any underlying \"trend\". Based on my history below of watching and acting on an increasing trend, my vote would be to always have too much information rather than too little so you can gradually be prepared to act, if need be. The idea that there is still PSA left over from benign tissue 15 months after surgery sounds like a stretch. At the same time, your latest number is lower than your PSA reading just after surgery so I would not hit the panic button just yet. Plus, my salvage radiation bill was $240,000, so it is unlikely that insurers or Medicare would pick up such an expense without a clear demonstration that you have experienced a biochemical recurrence; a post-surgery PSA reading of .07 most likely does not satisfy that criteria. My recommendation would be to accept the opinion of the doctor who said to watch for a trend. Best of luck, Jim",

What you will likely hear less often is that surgery provides a second grab at the brass ring of success which radiation rarely does. If your Dad elects surgery (which may not be available based on his age -- some doctors prefer not to perform surgery after age 70), and the cancer returns at a later date, he will have a \"second chance\" at a resolution via salvage radiation. That's what happened to me and several other PC forum brothers. My cancer returned three years after my DaVinci prostatectomy. Salvage radiation knocked down the cancer and now, three more years later, my PSA remains at zero. So, I tend to be biased in favor of surgery as a primary treatment, as do a large percentage of contributors to this website. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "jdsky: There is no link -- possibly deleted by webmaster? I agree with your position. PSA tests saved my life, not once, but twice, following a recurrence. The President's Death Panel has gone on record as saying that only one life is saved for every one thousand PSA tests administered. My position is that 1,000 lives can then be saved with each one million PSA tests. And that's a good thing, even considering any side effects that may result from treatment. If the intent is to keep the population uninformed via a diagnostic test that has led to a 44% decline in PC deaths since 1992, then let's do away altogether with diagnostic testing. X-ray machines ? Trash them. CT scans? Same thing. MRIs? A horribly expensive test that could save millions of dollars for insurance companies and the federal government (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) if we just destroy all of those machines. Then, like ostriches, we can all sink our heads in the sand permanently. Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Joe1 It seems to me that numbers do not lie, for most men the cost of false positive PSA testing and the resulting cost of over treatment of indolent cancers that would have never been an issue, is a waste of limited health care dollars, and yes there is only a limited number of dollars to go around, irregardless how highly one may value their own life. Everyone here who has benefited from early detection by a routine PSA obviously would want everyone else to have the same benefit, but what is lost in this argument is that those of you in this group are a minority of PCa patients as hard as that may be to accept based on your personal experience. The bottom line is this, every dollar spent on the over diagnosis and over treatment of indolent prostrate cancers that never would have threated one's health is a dollar taken away from everyone else with medical conditions that could have actually benefited from those medical dollars. So, Joe, we have a limited number of dollars to \"go around\" to save/prolong the lives of American citizens? No one mentioned that to me when I spent the last 50 years contributing to the Medicare program out of my earnings to insure that I had adequate medical coverage in my retirement years. I must have missed the part where we're all on monetary rations and must make sacrifices (including our lives, according to you) in order for financial aid to benefit the rest of the world. With hundreds of billion dollars sent to foreign countries via aid packages, they will prosper and thrive through the taxes collected from my years of labor. And we can't AFFORD PSA tests to continue to save lives here? I do not share your views.",

You guys have been great and more helpful than my urologist who I intend to replace once I can change during open enrollment in September. Is there any chance of these cancer cells migrating?[/QUOTE] Hi Howard: As a medical non-professional, my short answer is affirmative. The increase in my post-surgery PSA numbers over a 3-year period seems to indicate that was the case for me. As far as salvage radiation treatment, it's a balancing act to watch whether your PSA number may never exceed 0.1 and therefore follow-up treatment is not needed versus watching for an upward trend that makes it clear the critters are on the loose and there is no doubt that SR is warranted. That's probably an uninformed oversimplification of the issue but that's what I've got. Certainly, I invite our forum brothers to offer their thoughts. Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by fishinguy Thanks all. I hadn't originally planned for a second opinion. I've decided this weekend to do just that. My urologist, who has performed over 3000 open surgeries had talked about it right away, and reminded me that this s about me and not him. I like him, and trust him. But I think I may go to Mayo and have a talk with someone there. Funny, almost makes me feel like I'm cheating on a girlfriend going somewhere else. Anyone else ever had that feeling going for a second opinion? --Dan Dan: Yes, we get it. But when your life may depend on obtaining the best information on how to move forward, then cheating is not only condoned but encouraged. Jim",

And the numbers -- about $100 a month -- tell me that no one can afford to be without Medicare Part B. It pays 80% of your doctors fees and most diagnostic tests. Heck, one MRI is probably equivalent to 3 to 4 years of Part B premiums. You MUST have it. On the other hand, if you are destitute and really can't afford it, then you are almost certainly eligible for Medicaid which will cover most of your health care bills at little or no cost. And you should not wait for symptoms with a PSA of 65 which is actually a large red flashing neon sign that is saying you need to take action NOW. You don't have a weight problem -- you have a medical problem. I don't mean to be sarcastic but, really, all of the best diets and green veggies in the world won't change your PSA from 65 to 3.

      "Content": "\"One thing I forgot to mention is the biopsy report shows that he has chronic protastisis. Would that be a cause for the higher PSA number?\" Hi Dev: Yes, a diagnosis of chronic prostatitis could cause a high PSA number. However, that's a moot point now that the biopsy has confirmed a diagnosis of prostate cancer with a score of Gleason 7. The issue of chronic prostatitis is yet another good argument for surgery versus other treatment methods. Once the prostate is gone, the cancer may return (as in my example) but the chronic prostatitis will be gone forever. I hope I don't sound like a used car salesman. All options should be explored.

      "Content": "Welcome MissViv: Could you please provide us with some info, such as your husband's age, medical history and PSA results, within a signature, that led to his Gleason 8 diagnosis? In answer to your question about why both a CT scan and a full-body bone scan are usually recommended, other than being routine investigative tools, they also serve as means to avoid pointless procedures. As I'm sure you are already aware, Gleason 8 represents an aggressive form of prostate cancer. I apologize if this is too direct but the bone scan is looking for whether the cancer has spread (metastasis). If so, it \"could\" rule out some treatments, such as surgery. As long as the cancer is believed to be confined within the prostate, a \"cure\" remains possible. However, even under a worst case scenario of metastasis, treatments are available to extend life for years and, sometimes, decades. Of course, it's not possible for us to understand or evaluate how his prior colon cancer may or may not impact upon his current diagnosis. Best of luck, Jim",

You guys have been great and more helpful than my urologist who I intend to replace once I can change during open enrollment in September. Is there any chance of these cancer cells migrating?[/QUOTE] Hi Howard: As a medical non-professional, my short answer is affirmative. The increase in my post-surgery PSA numbers over a 3-year period seems to indicate that was the case for me. As far as salvage radiation treatment, it's a balancing act to watch whether your PSA number may never exceed 0.1 and therefore follow-up treatment is not needed versus watching for an upward trend that makes it clear the critters are on the loose and there is no doubt that SR is warranted. That's probably an uninformed oversimplification of the issue but that's what I've got. Certainly, I invite our forum brothers to offer their thoughts. Jim",

      "Content": "jdsky: There is no link -- possibly deleted by webmaster? I agree with your position. PSA tests saved my life, not once, but twice, following a recurrence. The President's Death Panel has gone on record as saying that only one life is saved for every one thousand PSA tests administered. My position is that 1,000 lives can then be saved with each one million PSA tests. And that's a good thing, even considering any side effects that may result from treatment. If the intent is to keep the population uninformed via a diagnostic test that has led to a 44% decline in PC deaths since 1992, then let's do away altogether with diagnostic testing. X-ray machines ? Trash them. CT scans? Same thing. MRIs? A horribly expensive test that could save millions of dollars for insurance companies and the federal government (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) if we just destroy all of those machines. Then, like ostriches, we can all sink our heads in the sand permanently. Jim",

But I think I may go to Mayo and have a talk with someone there. Funny, almost makes me feel like I'm cheating on a girlfriend going somewhere else. Anyone else ever had that feeling going for a second opinion? --Dan Dan: Yes, we get it.

      "Content": "Hi Mike: I, too, had the DaVinci procedure at age 68 in 2010. Last year, my PSA started climbing (not as high as yours) and I had 40 sessions of radiation ($240,000 billed to Medicare - I paid zero after Medigap paid their portion) that knocked the PSA down to 0.00. In answer to your question about doctor-administered drugs or shots, I reviewed my Medicare statements and it looks like 80% was paid by Medicare on multiple occasions (but no Lupron). And I suppose you have already done your research to select a Medicare Part \"D\" policy which will pay for regular prescriptions after a monthly fee and product co-pay. If we had to pay retail for my wife's anti-seizure anti-stroke drugs last year, the out-of-pocket costs would have exceeded $24,000. I'm not sure if I'm permitted to mention a specific Medigap policy to cover the remaining 20% on this website but my wife and I have had excellent results with AARP Medicare Supplemental (Medigap) coverage provided by United Healthcare. The cost in PA is about $200 per person per month. In nearly 7 years of coverage, through multiple surgeries, I have never had a deductible or co-pay of any kind and never filled out a single form after registration. Conversely, my research of Medicare Advantage plans produced a long list of high deductibles and co-pays which caused me to firmly decide against Advantage plans. Hope this helps a little. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Rob: The information you have received so far is accurate and timely. But look closely at my history below and you will find that my PSA post-surgery jumped from 0.02 to 0.04 and I was told that it was meaningless (sound familiar?). It was the advance notice (for me, not necessarily for you) that, three years after surgery, my prostate cancer had returned. And, although the accepted medical protocol confirmation of a biochemical recurrence happens after a patient receives at least 2 PSA readings of 0.2 or above, I opted for salvage radiation when my PSA reached 0.11, since an upward trend was obvious (Jim's protocol). I had zero side effects from the 40 sessions of salvage radiation and, at least for now, the monster is being held at bay, based on my recent pristine PSA results. Of course, no one knows what the future holds. My suggestion is to keep a close eye on your PSA numbers and consider taking action if and when you exceed 0.1, not 0.2. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Howard: I've never heard of a post-surgery PSA reading of .03 as being considered a recurrence. Chuck's explanation is the industry standard. Are you certain that you have the decimal point in the right location? Medicare did pay for almost all of my salvage radiation while the remainder was paid by my Medicare supplemental insurance. I paid nothing. But, keep in mind that my SR began at a PSA reading of 0.16. For the reasons explained earlier, I suspect that Medicare would decline payment of SR at a PSA reading of 0.07. But I could be wrong. You'll want to investigate with Medicare before you give the green light for salvage radiation. Good luck, Jim",

Now, that 10 hours in the air round-trip to Vegas and back to PA seems like just too much effort, especially for this rapidly aging white-knuckle flier. But the very BEST thing about poker is that my legally-wedded nightmare (now 50 years, 6 months and counting) started playing in poker tournaments about 10 years ago, instead of feeding $100 bills into slot machines. That literally saves me thousands of dollars a year. Jim",

I apologize if this is too direct but the bone scan is looking for whether the cancer has spread (metastasis). If so, it \"could\" rule out some treatments, such as surgery. As long as the cancer is believed to be confined within the prostate, a \"cure\" remains possible. However, even under a worst case scenario of metastasis, treatments are available to extend life for years and, sometimes, decades. Of course, it's not possible for us to understand or evaluate how his prior colon cancer may or may not impact upon his current diagnosis. Best of luck, Jim",

In most attempts at diagnosing the prostate, an MRI is usually ordered prior to the biopsy, not after it, in order to help identify specific areas of interest to draw specimens from. However, the doctor obviously has a reason so far be it from me to argue. Please keep us updated and while we are not medical professionals, we frequently are able to share our experiences that can be helpful to those who face this particular challenge. All the best, Jim",

Are you certain that you have the decimal point in the right location? Medicare did pay for almost all of my salvage radiation while the remainder was paid by my Medicare supplemental insurance. I paid nothing. But, keep in mind that my SR began at a PSA reading of 0.16. For the reasons explained earlier, I suspect that Medicare would decline payment of SR at a PSA reading of 0.07. But I could be wrong. You'll want to investigate with Medicare before you give the green light for salvage radiation. Good luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Howard: You raise the never-ending query about which PSA test is better -- the standard biopsy where a post-surgery result of <0.1 is considered \"undetectable\" as recommended by the Mayo Clinic -- or the readings of an ultra-sensitive machine that takes the number to the second decimal, thereby divulging any underlying \"trend\". Based on my history below of watching and acting on an increasing trend, my vote would be to always have too much information rather than too little so you can gradually be prepared to act, if need be. The idea that there is still PSA left over from benign tissue 15 months after surgery sounds like a stretch. At the same time, your latest number is lower than your PSA reading just after surgery so I would not hit the panic button just yet. Plus, my salvage radiation bill was $240,000, so it is unlikely that insurers or Medicare would pick up such an expense without a clear demonstration that you have experienced a biochemical recurrence; a post-surgery PSA reading of .07 most likely does not satisfy that criteria. My recommendation would be to accept the opinion of the doctor who said to watch for a trend. Best of luck, Jim",

The zero PSA at 12 weeks is VERY encouraging and yet....something seems out of whack. Although I have about 15 or 20 questions bouncing around in the back of my head, there is one that jumps out at me: If the doctor believes adjuvant or salvage radiation is \"...not effective for this type of cancer...\", then I would want to know exactly what he means by that statement. And if what he says is accurate, wouldn't that remain true at 3 months, 6 months or 12 months post-surgery and make future PSA tests pointless, with respect to considering AR or SR? John (MM) touched on it briefly -- and it's obviously a sensitive area -- but it almost sounds like the surgeon suspects metastasis has already occurred and radiation of the prostate bed would be a moot point. As the loving spouse, you are certainly entitled to know the answer to that and the only way to find out is to ask the doctor directly. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "As noted on a couple of other threads, you and I have traveled a similar prostate cancer path. Having 6 colon polyps removed is time for celebration, in my view, not stress at all. You have literally hit two home runs by finding and eradicating, not one, but two silent killers - prostate cancer AND colon cancer -- by having timely tests that many others delay until it's too late. I suspect that your next colonoscopy will be scheduled for less than 10 years, which will contribute to staying on top of a potential problem. In answer to your question, however, I can relate to at least one upcoming test that I am not looking forward to on June 13th. It is a simple Cat Scan with contrast of the chest which will determine whether a nodule remains in my right lung middle lobe and will have to be excised via the removal of part or all of that particular lobe. That decision - to remove the entire lobe - will be made while I'm still unconscious on the operating table if the lab says the nodule is cancerous. The national mortality rate for that operation is 3%. The recovery period at home is a full two months. I am worried that once I have part of a lung cut out, it could lead to a downward health spiral which I've seen before in others. With prostate cancer in 2010, I leaped onto the operating table. With horrible jump-off-a-bridge type pain in my right leg, I leaped onto the operating table to undergo spine surgery in 2011 (Success). With the likelihood of lung cancer this time around, I just have a bad feeling about this one. I'll climb onto the table but I won't be leaping.",

      "Content": "Welcome MissViv: Could you please provide us with some info, such as your husband's age, medical history and PSA results, within a signature, that led to his Gleason 8 diagnosis? In answer to your question about why both a CT scan and a full-body bone scan are usually recommended, other than being routine investigative tools, they also serve as means to avoid pointless procedures. As I'm sure you are already aware, Gleason 8 represents an aggressive form of prostate cancer. I apologize if this is too direct but the bone scan is looking for whether the cancer has spread (metastasis). If so, it \"could\" rule out some treatments, such as surgery. As long as the cancer is believed to be confined within the prostate, a \"cure\" remains possible. However, even under a worst case scenario of metastasis, treatments are available to extend life for years and, sometimes, decades. Of course, it's not possible for us to understand or evaluate how his prior colon cancer may or may not impact upon his current diagnosis. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Pierre: With your family history, it is only normal to be concerned about whether you might yet become another prostate cancer patient. And you will find a number of posters on this site who religiously rail against prostate biopsies until the PSA level reaches a point where there is no question that it needs to be done. Normally, I'm in the other camp encouraging biopsies. But with a PSA of only 1.7 and no mention of DRE abnormalities, I would not recommend (again, as a non-professional) a biopsy until you experience significant changes in your PSA or DRE. As Chuck mentioned, you should probably have no trouble in getting a GP to order a PSA based on your age (over 50) and your family history. If you continue to be concerned, you could ask for a PSA scrip every six months. Whether insurance pays for every test is really not relevant because a PSA test is not cost-prohibitive if you have to pay for it out-of-pocket. And it may help to give you peace of mind. Good luck, Jim",

But the very BEST thing about poker is that my legally-wedded nightmare (now 50 years, 6 months and counting) started playing in poker tournaments about 10 years ago, instead of feeding $100 bills into slot machines.

Apparently, the doctor feels that the patient may not be physically able to withstand the rigors of chemo. From what the OP describes, with his Dad in a weakened condition, would you consider that the time is rapidly approaching when a decision needs to be made regarding quantity versus quality of time remaining? Perhaps a consultation with a medical professional specializing in palliative care could spell out the various scenarios. In fact, as noted, the earlier removal of the patient's testicles (orchiectomy) in January, 2012 is described in medical journals as a form of palliative treatment in dealing with advanced prostate cancer. Just a thought. Jim",

      "Content": "Newporter: Your knowledge of chemo is much more extensive than mine but, please forgive my interjection, I didn't see a mention of any potentially nasty side effects. Apparently, the doctor feels that the patient may not be physically able to withstand the rigors of chemo. From what the OP describes, with his Dad in a weakened condition, would you consider that the time is rapidly approaching when a decision needs to be made regarding quantity versus quality of time remaining? Perhaps a consultation with a medical professional specializing in palliative care could spell out the various scenarios. In fact, as noted, the earlier removal of the patient's testicles (orchiectomy) in January, 2012 is described in medical journals as a form of palliative treatment in dealing with advanced prostate cancer. Just a thought. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Pierre: With your family history, it is only normal to be concerned about whether you might yet become another prostate cancer patient. And you will find a number of posters on this site who religiously rail against prostate biopsies until the PSA level reaches a point where there is no question that it needs to be done. Normally, I'm in the other camp encouraging biopsies. But with a PSA of only 1.7 and no mention of DRE abnormalities, I would not recommend (again, as a non-professional) a biopsy until you experience significant changes in your PSA or DRE. As Chuck mentioned, you should probably have no trouble in getting a GP to order a PSA based on your age (over 50) and your family history. If you continue to be concerned, you could ask for a PSA scrip every six months. Whether insurance pays for every test is really not relevant because a PSA test is not cost-prohibitive if you have to pay for it out-of-pocket. And it may help to give you peace of mind. Good luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Stuart: I have zero knowledge about what Canadian health care insurance allows but this comment from Michael F last week may serve to \"split\" the difference between a second biopsy versus no biopsy (hope you don't mind my plagiarism, Michael): \"With today's available technologies, why won't insurance allow for a 3T MRI (that simultaneously captures the data for a subsequent ultrasound guided biopsy, if needed) for those who are suspected to have PC based on PSA data (elevated or rising) and DRE results and after BPH has been ruled out?\" Rather than advocate for a biopsy, perhaps you could campaign for the 3T MRI which is less invasive. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Thanks, Allen. That's the kind of info I like to hear. For the last 17 years during July/August, my wife of 50 years has traveled out West in the U.S. for 2 weeks with a girlfriend who has a condo in Park City, Utah that they use as a base camp. They've visited 15-16 states. They're into that outdoor stuff - not for me - while I require a hotel with an air-conditioned cocktail lounge. Well, she says she goes with a girlfriend but for some reason, I've never met the girlfriend. Just kidding. Anyway, she cancelled her plans for this year, knowing that I may need her help during my lung cancer surgery rehab. I feel bad that I'm responsible for breaking her streak but I can't seem to teach our Shih Tzu how to change dressings. Jim",

      "Content": "My thoughts are: Your plan to wait three months for another PSA is valid; Your plan to STILL avoid a biopsy if the next PSA is the same (7.9) or higher is questionable. In the U.S., a common pursuit after a high initial PSA is to try antibiotics to rule out infection (yes, I know it's not perfect). Absent that path, on receiving a second high PSA reading, I would not dick around anymore with alternatives. Don't be concerned about a biopsy being \"cost effective\" to an insurer. Be more concerned about a biopsy being an \"anti-death effective\" option to you, the patient. Once again, a biopsy is the ONLY way to confirm the existence of prostate cancer. Why settle for anything less?",

      "Content": "Hi Samie: As someone who has benefited from salvage radiation, I concur with Michigan Man on virtually every aspect of your husband's case. The zero PSA at 12 weeks is VERY encouraging and yet....something seems out of whack. Although I have about 15 or 20 questions bouncing around in the back of my head, there is one that jumps out at me: If the doctor believes adjuvant or salvage radiation is \"...not effective for this type of cancer...\", then I would want to know exactly what he means by that statement. And if what he says is accurate, wouldn't that remain true at 3 months, 6 months or 12 months post-surgery and make future PSA tests pointless, with respect to considering AR or SR? John (MM) touched on it briefly -- and it's obviously a sensitive area -- but it almost sounds like the surgeon suspects metastasis has already occurred and radiation of the prostate bed would be a moot point. As the loving spouse, you are certainly entitled to know the answer to that and the only way to find out is to ask the doctor directly. Best of luck, Jim",

For the last 17 years during July/August, my wife of 50 years has traveled out West in the U.S. for 2 weeks with a girlfriend who has a condo in Park City, Utah that they use as a base camp. They've visited 15-16 states. They're into that outdoor stuff - not for me - while I require a hotel with an air-conditioned cocktail lounge. Well, she says she goes with a girlfriend but for some reason, I've never met the girlfriend. Just kidding. Anyway, she cancelled her plans for this year, knowing that I may need her help during my lung cancer surgery rehab.

      "Content": "Hi Don: Excellent detailed history. More people should keep a journal like yours. Glad your biopsy wasn't as bad as expected. Those online calculators estimating the percentage likelihood of cancer, in my estimation, only add to a person's anxiety levels and serve no useful purpose. For example, at age 72, the likelihood that I would win a $17,500 World Poker Tour online prize package against more than 3,200 opponents was probably less than 1%, yet I did just that last month. Go figure. And to speculate about various scenarios -- no cancer versus aggressive cancer -- again benefits no one, especially you. Only the biopsy will tell the tale. While it often misses finding actual cancer, if it does find a malignancy they will be able to stage it and provide a Gleason score that should reveal what you are dealing with. Once you receive those results, please come back and the caring people on this site who have \"been there, done that\" will be able to share with you their experiences which, hopefully, will be beneficial to you. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "As noted on a couple of other threads, you and I have traveled a similar prostate cancer path. Having 6 colon polyps removed is time for celebration, in my view, not stress at all. You have literally hit two home runs by finding and eradicating, not one, but two silent killers - prostate cancer AND colon cancer -- by having timely tests that many others delay until it's too late. I suspect that your next colonoscopy will be scheduled for less than 10 years, which will contribute to staying on top of a potential problem. In answer to your question, however, I can relate to at least one upcoming test that I am not looking forward to on June 13th. It is a simple Cat Scan with contrast of the chest which will determine whether a nodule remains in my right lung middle lobe and will have to be excised via the removal of part or all of that particular lobe. That decision - to remove the entire lobe - will be made while I'm still unconscious on the operating table if the lab says the nodule is cancerous. The national mortality rate for that operation is 3%. The recovery period at home is a full two months. I am worried that once I have part of a lung cut out, it could lead to a downward health spiral which I've seen before in others. With prostate cancer in 2010, I leaped onto the operating table. With horrible jump-off-a-bridge type pain in my right leg, I leaped onto the operating table to undergo spine surgery in 2011 (Success). With the likelihood of lung cancer this time around, I just have a bad feeling about this one. I'll climb onto the table but I won't be leaping.",

From what I have read of other forum brothers' experiences, that would appear to be something that a minority of others have suffered. At age 71, I began my forty SR treatments three years after a DaVinci prostatectomy. I had zero side effects except for some minor fatigue toward the end of treatment. My history below continues to show a PSA of 0.00 three years post-SR. While no one can predict the future, I am comfortable that I made the right decision for myself at the time. Personally, given evidence of a biochemical recurrence, I would be focused not on \"possible\" side effects of salvage radiation but rather on the very real implications of a steadily rising PSA. Seven years ago, you took on PC and won the battle. My suggestion is to not allow The Beast to win the war now. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "My thoughts are: Your plan to wait three months for another PSA is valid; Your plan to STILL avoid a biopsy if the next PSA is the same (7.9) or higher is questionable. In the U.S., a common pursuit after a high initial PSA is to try antibiotics to rule out infection (yes, I know it's not perfect). Absent that path, on receiving a second high PSA reading, I would not dick around anymore with alternatives. Don't be concerned about a biopsy being \"cost effective\" to an insurer. Be more concerned about a biopsy being an \"anti-death effective\" option to you, the patient. Once again, a biopsy is the ONLY way to confirm the existence of prostate cancer. Why settle for anything less?",

      "Content": "PDV: As a veteran poster, you are familiar with the issue that your question goes back to the never-ending discussion of: \"You should be kept in the dark regarding any PSA reading under 0.1 because it can only cause anxiety\". As Chuck points out, even the Mayo Clinic offers that recommendation. But, since you ask, and since I just received my latest post-surgery, post salvage radiation semi-annual PSA test result within the last hour (0.00 -- three years straight), my response to your question is: it depends. It depends on the specific machinery -- or assay -- used to reach the \"actual\" PSA result. In some cases, <0.02 or 0.01 may indeed be considered truly \"undetectable\". Only the medical professional -- or the doctor who ordered the test -- processing the results can adequately answer your question. When I received my first post-surgery PSA test result and it was 0.02, I was quite upset and made it clear to the surgeon that I was VERY concerned. He replied that it was nothing to worry about. However, in my case (which may be atypical) the PSA number continued to rise over a 3-year period resulting in the necessity to employ salvage radiation -- so far, so good. Finally, while I would love to say that your 0.01 is nothing to worry about, I can only share with you my personal belief that an unarguable TRUE zero is 0.00 and nothing else. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Don: Excellent detailed history. More people should keep a journal like yours. Glad your biopsy wasn't as bad as expected. Those online calculators estimating the percentage likelihood of cancer, in my estimation, only add to a person's anxiety levels and serve no useful purpose. For example, at age 72, the likelihood that I would win a $17,500 World Poker Tour online prize package against more than 3,200 opponents was probably less than 1%, yet I did just that last month. Go figure. And to speculate about various scenarios -- no cancer versus aggressive cancer -- again benefits no one, especially you. Only the biopsy will tell the tale. While it often misses finding actual cancer, if it does find a malignancy they will be able to stage it and provide a Gleason score that should reveal what you are dealing with. Once you receive those results, please come back and the caring people on this site who have \"been there, done that\" will be able to share with you their experiences which, hopefully, will be beneficial to you. Best of luck. Jim",

My reaction to the diagnosis of the Big \"C\" was in no way welcoming but, at the same time, after letting the news sink in, I could only describe my feelings as being pragmatic. Something is bad -- something is broken -- let's fix it. Nothing more -- nothing less. I'm happy with the outcome even though the cancer returned 3 years later. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't change anything. My only acknowledgement to the disease is that I end my e-mails with \"I'm still here\". Best of luck to you in your recovery, Jim",

But at least it provides an enthralling and captivating-topic-of-discussion narrative while having a drink with friends. Forty years ago, they sent men to the moon but they still have to fire a spear gun up our butt to learn what they need to know. It could be worse. Twenty years ago, I had to have TWO barium enemas within one week in a hospital where a tech shoves a garden hose up your kazoo, then from another room inflates your abdomen with barium until it triples in size and looks like you will explode. But the WORST part was that I needed to keep my butt cheeks clenched because if that hose ever came out while the test was being performed, there would be barium spread over many, many acres. If nothing else, there is a measure of empathy extended and a declaration that the guys at cocktail hour were immensely grateful it happened to me and not them. We do what we can.",

      "Content": "Hi Don: Excellent detailed history. More people should keep a journal like yours. Glad your biopsy wasn't as bad as expected. Those online calculators estimating the percentage likelihood of cancer, in my estimation, only add to a person's anxiety levels and serve no useful purpose. For example, at age 72, the likelihood that I would win a $17,500 World Poker Tour online prize package against more than 3,200 opponents was probably less than 1%, yet I did just that last month. Go figure. And to speculate about various scenarios -- no cancer versus aggressive cancer -- again benefits no one, especially you. Only the biopsy will tell the tale. While it often misses finding actual cancer, if it does find a malignancy they will be able to stage it and provide a Gleason score that should reveal what you are dealing with. Once you receive those results, please come back and the caring people on this site who have \"been there, done that\" will be able to share with you their experiences which, hopefully, will be beneficial to you. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "\"Waiting for the urologist on call\" jumps out at me. Upon surgical discharge, virtually all patients receive specific written instructions on how to proceed if a post-surgery problem occurs. This should include direct access to YOUR surgeon, not some resident medical student staffing the ER \"on call\" at 3AM who has never seen your husband before. Since you don't believe that his doctor has received messages left for him, then I suggest a proactive approach: Show up at the doctor's office, unannounced and without an appointment. As you explain the reason for your presence to the counter staff, be sure to do so loud enough that patients in the waiting room overhear your dilemma. You may be pleasantly surprised that, in order to avoid an exodus of potential surgical patients heading for the door after hearing your husband's tale of woe, a block of time may be allocated to you to meet with the surgeon then and there. At this point, you have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Needless to say, complications can always arise, but to receive no response from the surgeon is unforgivable and should not be tolerated. Make noise!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Maverick91 My DW and I met with the radiologist this morning. It was a consult to talk about IMRT as a treatment option. To hear him talk, I haven't found a downside, compared to what I've learned about a surgical option. We meet with the surgeon next week to discuss that option. With my cancer being so early, we're not in a rush, per se. Radiation and surgery have roughly equal successful outcomes. But the \"downside\" could come if you experience a recurrence. With surgery, you have the fall-back option of salvage radiation to solidify a cure. With radiation as primary treatment, there are little to no fall-back options to a cure. Personally, those two statements caused me to choose surgery and it was fortunate that I did, because my PC returned 3 years post-surgery. As long as your Gleason 6 is accurate, you have time to weigh the choices. Best of luck, Jim",

When I first heard that I had prostate cancer -- The Big \"C\" -- I figured at age 68 that I had bought the farm. Then my urologist said, \"Snap out of it. Stop being so freaking dramatic. You have a common, garden-variety Gleason 7 version of prostate cancer that we see every day and we almost always treat it successfully. A year from now, it will be a distant memory\". While that wasn't exactly true -- I had a recurrence 3 years later -- I'm just fine now. In fact, at age 73, I appeared last month on national television where I won a large poker tournament on the World Poker Tour in Atlantic City. I'm still here. You're going to be just fine. Jim",

I would be very interested in the names and locations of the doctors who will even attempt such a surgery, per your \"research\". In 2014, my research found a total of only 5 doctors in the entire United States who performed salvage surgery after failed primary radiation (2 in L.A., one each in Dallas, Miami and Boston). And, of course, that means traveling to a distant city for the high-risk surgery -- they're not coming to you. Salvage radiation, on the other hand, is performed extensively.",

This supposed \"cure\" has been around for more than sixty years and is touted as \"the cancer cure that the medical community doesn't want anybody to know about\". During those sixty years, not one study has proven this diet effective at curing cancer or anything else. Maybe it can cure dandruff. If you have a loved one fighting prostate cancer, he may as well try peanut butter and jelly (which may be more nutritious) but it too will not cure his cancer. There is no magic bullet -- or magic quark cheese. A patient may have only one chance to beat prostate cancer (usually treatable and curable via surgery or radiation, if caught early).

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Maverick91 Actually, I've been told the differently, by two doctors, and my own research backs up the idea, that after radiation, surgery may still be an option. I would be very interested in the names and locations of the doctors who will even attempt such a surgery, per your \"research\". In 2014, my research found a total of only 5 doctors in the entire United States who performed salvage surgery after failed primary radiation (2 in L.A., one each in Dallas, Miami and Boston). And, of course, that means traveling to a distant city for the high-risk surgery -- they're not coming to you. Salvage radiation, on the other hand, is performed extensively.",

The discharge paperwork provided by my surgeon suggested that I would not likely find dryness until the end of the second month. Voila! By the 60th day, I was completely dry and remained so. But, at the same time, based upon the experiences of others in the same situation, I would not be concerned that your 4-week history is out of the ordinary. Best of luck on your journey to drydock.",

      "Content": "Some insurance companies are notorious for trying to find ways NOT to pay and they're willing to spend a little to avoid paying a lot. For example, three years ago, my best friend's brother-in-law had a high PSA and his biopsy was either Gleason 8 or 9. He decided he wanted robotic surgery, his doctor agreed but his employer's insurance company required a full body bone scan first or they would not pay for the surgery. The bone scan revealed metastasis to other areas. Based on those findings, the insurance company refused to pay for a prostatectomy for a patient they considered to have limited time remaining. So, the bone scan can be a double-edged sword.",

At your age, I believe you have made a wise choice for your future. As you approach 9/14 and after surgery, we should be able to share some tips that you may find helpful from our experiences. For example, I'm the \"recliner guy\". When you arrive back home with a catheter for a week to 10 days (it was my first-ever experience with a catheter -- wasn't even sure how it worked), it should cause zero pain but it is a nuisance. What I found was that trying to lie flat in bed posed some logistical problems for me as I constantly toss and turn. I slept instead in a recliner with the Foley bag in a bucket at my feet and that worked great for me. Another poster on this site said he liked it SO much, he has remained in the recliner for the last six months, while his wife urges him to return to bed. We'll be here with you every step of the way. The only dumb question is the one left unasked. Best of luck, Jim",

What if your cognitive abilities diminished (certainly not demonstrated here as you have done an excellent job articulating your dilemma) over 20 years and not 10 years? If you do have prostate cancer -- which if caught early is nearly 100% curable -- then why not investigate the degree via a biopsy? Especially with young children dependent upon you. Our moderator, Chuck, who is a very easy-going guy, demonstrated his concerns through his words. On the other hand, since this is a prostate cancer forum and you insist that you have no interest in seeking a potential cure, why are you wasting our time? Jim",

Once cancer is confirmed, no diet is going to make it disappear. The CT and full-body bone scan, as you likely know, will act to determine the next step. It is standard procedure and should reveal whether a patient is actually a candidate for a \"cure\" (cancer has not metastasized to other areas of the body) usually via surgery or radiation, or whether the objective is to extend life through various applications of hormone therapy. Please don't misinterpret my layman's explanation (none of us are physicians on this site and, therefore, can't make recommendations -- only share our experiences) as extension of life is often many years, even many decades. We will be here for any questions you may have along the way and our esteemed moderator, Chuck, should be along shortly to provide a formal welcome.

      "Content": "Hi Mike: Michael F provides excellent observations relative to your inquiry. As a DaVinci AND salvage radiation patient, I would simply add the following: In my case, my urologist recommended and worked closely with a radiation oncologist following a PC recurrence 3 years after DaVinci. In the 2 years since I received salvage radiation, I alternated visits between the urologist and oncologist as they monitored my PSA levels which, thankfully, have remained at 0.00. Last week, I had my final visit with the oncologist who handed me back to my urologist for continued care of my plumbing which has a nasty habit of developing kidney stones (7 attacks in the last 7 years -- two removed surgically from the left ureter in 2008 & 2014). In your case, assuming you are covered by Medicare, you may run into a problem getting approval for salvage radiation if your PSA remains undetectable. My oncologist billed Medicare $240,000 for 40 sessions of SR (no, that's not a typo) and, under Obamacare, you may be required to show a demonstrated need for SR. That's just my non-professional thoughts and I could be wrong, but it is certainly something you may wish to inquire about. Best of luck, Jim",

And it's especially frustrating when that opinion is DEAD wrong. Many posters on this site -- including me - have had surgery and then salvage radiation when the PC returned. Today, I have no detectable cancer. Oh, by the way, during my treatment and in the 3 years since my 40 sessions of radiation, I have experienced ZERO side effects. If your Dad was not going to have radiation, come hell or high water, then I just have one question. Why did he bother having the surgery? He could have saved himself a lot of wasted energy by simply throwing in the towel pre-surgery. Please encourage him to read the outcomes on this site and try to keep an OPEN mind.

And it's especially frustrating when that opinion is DEAD wrong. Many posters on this site -- including me - have had surgery and then salvage radiation when the PC returned. Today, I have no detectable cancer. Oh, by the way, during my treatment and in the 3 years since my 40 sessions of radiation, I have experienced ZERO side effects. If your Dad was not going to have radiation, come hell or high water, then I just have one question. Why did he bother having the surgery? He could have saved himself a lot of wasted energy by simply throwing in the towel pre-surgery. Please encourage him to read the outcomes on this site and try to keep an OPEN mind. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Maverick91 Actually, I've been told the differently, by two doctors, and my own research backs up the idea, that after radiation, surgery may still be an option. I would be very interested in the names and locations of the doctors who will even attempt such a surgery, per your \"research\". In 2014, my research found a total of only 5 doctors in the entire United States who performed salvage surgery after failed primary radiation (2 in L.A., one each in Dallas, Miami and Boston). And, of course, that means traveling to a distant city for the high-risk surgery -- they're not coming to you. Salvage radiation, on the other hand, is performed extensively.",

Since the travel was over two major roads that are frequently subject to gridlock, I decided, for me, the best resolution was to arrive an hour early and consume the water on-site at the radiation center. Eventually, I chose a radiologist who didn't believe in inflating the bladder which caused my anxiety level to go back to normal. Glad to hear your SR is going fine. Jim",

Once cancer is confirmed, no diet is going to make it disappear. The CT and full-body bone scan, as you likely know, will act to determine the next step. It is standard procedure and should reveal whether a patient is actually a candidate for a \"cure\" (cancer has not metastasized to other areas of the body) usually via surgery or radiation, or whether the objective is to extend life through various applications of hormone therapy. Please don't misinterpret my layman's explanation (none of us are physicians on this site and, therefore, can't make recommendations -- only share our experiences) as extension of life is often many years, even many decades. We will be here for any questions you may have along the way and our esteemed moderator, Chuck, should be along shortly to provide a formal welcome. Generally speaking, if your husband was going to have any cancer, this is the one he wants because the survival rate is nearly 100% if caught early and treated. Others are not as fortunate, as they deal with diminished five-year survival rates (pancreatic and lung cancer). A Gleason 7 is in the moderate range so there is every reason to be hopeful that, following treatment, this will merely be a bump in life's highway and nearly forgotten in the years to come.

The discharge paperwork provided by my surgeon suggested that I would not likely find dryness until the end of the second month. Voila! By the 60th day, I was completely dry and remained so. But, at the same time, based upon the experiences of others in the same situation, I would not be concerned that your 4-week history is out of the ordinary. Best of luck on your journey to drydock.",

      "Content": "Hi Janet: Welcome to a club that no one wants to be a member of. While some members prefer specific diets, I'm not a fan. Once cancer is confirmed, no diet is going to make it disappear. The CT and full-body bone scan, as you likely know, will act to determine the next step. It is standard procedure and should reveal whether a patient is actually a candidate for a \"cure\" (cancer has not metastasized to other areas of the body) usually via surgery or radiation, or whether the objective is to extend life through various applications of hormone therapy. Please don't misinterpret my layman's explanation (none of us are physicians on this site and, therefore, can't make recommendations -- only share our experiences) as extension of life is often many years, even many decades. We will be here for any questions you may have along the way and our esteemed moderator, Chuck, should be along shortly to provide a formal welcome. Generally speaking, if your husband was going to have any cancer, this is the one he wants because the survival rate is nearly 100% if caught early and treated. Others are not as fortunate, as they deal with diminished five-year survival rates (pancreatic and lung cancer). A Gleason 7 is in the moderate range so there is every reason to be hopeful that, following treatment, this will merely be a bump in life's highway and nearly forgotten in the years to come. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Drbbt: It's great that you've been on top of this issue for years and have a better grasp of what to expect than, say, someone who is learning for the first time that they have PC. At your age, I believe you have made a wise choice for your future. As you approach 9/14 and after surgery, we should be able to share some tips that you may find helpful from our experiences. For example, I'm the \"recliner guy\". When you arrive back home with a catheter for a week to 10 days (it was my first-ever experience with a catheter -- wasn't even sure how it worked), it should cause zero pain but it is a nuisance. What I found was that trying to lie flat in bed posed some logistical problems for me as I constantly toss and turn. I slept instead in a recliner with the Foley bag in a bucket at my feet and that worked great for me. Another poster on this site said he liked it SO much, he has remained in the recliner for the last six months, while his wife urges him to return to bed. We'll be here with you every step of the way. The only dumb question is the one left unasked. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome cliffytom: Blood clots can be very serious, so the need to take action ASAP is certainly understandable. However, a medical opinion that something is \"most likely Stage 4 prostate cancer\" seems questionable without a solid confirmation. I have no medical training whatsoever, but even to a layman, the commencement of treatment (Firmagon) in the absence of a confirmation of prostate cancer raises a red flag. Have you acquainted yourselves with the substantial side effects of Firmagon (degarelix)? As Chuck said, only a biopsy can confirm PC. Has there been any discussion of performing a prostate biopsy? Could you share with us the specific results of his CT scan? Hopefully, the full-body bone scan will help to reveal whatever underlying problem(s) are present. It's always possible that his urination difficulties are completely unrelated to the blood clots. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Janet: Welcome to a club that no one wants to be a member of. While some members prefer specific diets, I'm not a fan. Once cancer is confirmed, no diet is going to make it disappear. The CT and full-body bone scan, as you likely know, will act to determine the next step. It is standard procedure and should reveal whether a patient is actually a candidate for a \"cure\" (cancer has not metastasized to other areas of the body) usually via surgery or radiation, or whether the objective is to extend life through various applications of hormone therapy. Please don't misinterpret my layman's explanation (none of us are physicians on this site and, therefore, can't make recommendations -- only share our experiences) as extension of life is often many years, even many decades. We will be here for any questions you may have along the way and our esteemed moderator, Chuck, should be along shortly to provide a formal welcome. Generally speaking, if your husband was going to have any cancer, this is the one he wants because the survival rate is nearly 100% if caught early and treated. Others are not as fortunate, as they deal with diminished five-year survival rates (pancreatic and lung cancer). A Gleason 7 is in the moderate range so there is every reason to be hopeful that, following treatment, this will merely be a bump in life's highway and nearly forgotten in the years to come. Best of luck, Jim",

Our friend, Allen from Toronto, began SR at an even lower number. Am I reading your signature correctly that you commenced SR with a PSA of .07? Assuming you had insurance coverage, was there no problem getting approval for SR at that level? Best of luck to you during treatment. I hope you have clear sailing, as I did. Jim",

What if your cognitive abilities diminished (certainly not demonstrated here as you have done an excellent job articulating your dilemma) over 20 years and not 10 years? If you do have prostate cancer -- which if caught early is nearly 100% curable -- then why not investigate the degree via a biopsy? Especially with young children dependent upon you. Our moderator, Chuck, who is a very easy-going guy, demonstrated his concerns through his words. On the other hand, since this is a prostate cancer forum and you insist that you have no interest in seeking a potential cure, why are you wasting our time? Jim",

What if your cognitive abilities diminished (certainly not demonstrated here as you have done an excellent job articulating your dilemma) over 20 years and not 10 years? If you do have prostate cancer -- which if caught early is nearly 100% curable -- then why not investigate the degree via a biopsy? Especially with young children dependent upon you. Our moderator, Chuck, who is a very easy-going guy, demonstrated his concerns through his words. On the other hand, since this is a prostate cancer forum and you insist that you have no interest in seeking a potential cure, why are you wasting our time? Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Angelmum: With respect to treatment, as you can see from my signature, I sampled a little bit of almost everything. When my PC came back three years after robotic surgery, I had 40 sessions of radiation just before I turned 71, a few years younger than your uncle. So far, my outcome has been on target (PSA=0.00) and the salvage radiotherapy I received caused no problems to speak of. A couple of caveats: my radiation dosage was focused on the remaining prostate bed so the dosage was less than for primary treatment of PC. If you do decide on radiotherapy, be wary of \"quick fixes\" of only 5 radiotherapy sessions with devices like the Cyberknife where massive doses of radiation may result in serious painful burns. I personally know of two patients who suffered burns completely through the anal wall. As long as you gather the info needed from various sources, including recommendations from others on this site who have experienced a similar scenario -- especially the age factor -- then you will gain confidence in arriving at the right treatment decision.

      "Content": "Chuck points out that your progressively higher PSA readings could be caused by infection or an enlarged prostate. Left unsaid is that you possibly could have prostate cancer which is spreading. And a biopsy is the only way to know for certain. Your words \"...single biopsy also can often tell nothing...\" and \"...one problem might be, saturation biopsy might not be a preferred way for most urologist in Canada...\" sound like you're searching for reasons to not have the biopsy. While you vacillate, bad things could be happening internally. When you come onto an online prostate cancer forum and ask for comments, you're not going to like some of the feedback. I'm sure I fit that scenario but, given six progressively higher PSA tests over 4.0, try stepping back and look at the big picture and ask, \"What would the average person do?\".",

Five years ago, I considered Dr. Lee at HUP since he was the recognized leader in DaVinci surgery in the region at that time and remains so today. In my view, you would be in excellent hands if you decide to choose Dr. Lee for your surgery. I live about 5 miles west of Philadelphia and most doctors that I see are on the Main Line, just outside Philly. If it had been a transplant of some kind, I would have gone into Philly for the surgery. But, while I viewed a prostatectomy as serious surgery, I decided instead to stay out of the city and have my DaVinci robotic surgery performed by the leading surgeon in the western suburbs, Dr. David McGinnis, who is a member of the urology group where I was a patient. My surgery was performed at Bryn Mawr Hospital and was textbook with no pain and 60 days to full continence post-surgery. However, I did have a small positive margin that resulted in a BCR 3 years later and salvage radiation to knock it down. As of now, as you can see from the history below, my PSA levels remain at 0.00 two years after salvage radiation. As for the future, who knows? And while no one wants to be pressured to make a decision quickly (\"the price I'm offering you for this car is only good for today\"), the fact that you have 4 positive cores - yes, you have prostate cancer, albeit it a Gleason 6 - also means that you would do yourself a disservice if you take a long time to ponder your next step.

      "Content": "Thanks, Highlander. As of last summer, my urologist and two oncology radiologists in suburban Philadelphia informed me that the \"0.2 PSA threshold following prostatectomy\" was being closely watched by their medical communities as possibly being somewhat outdated. They claimed that more recent studies have shown a moderately higher successful radiation outcome when they eyeball and evaluate any reading exceeding 0.1 PSA. That's not to say that everyone who has a reading higher than 0.1 PSA needs immediate radiation. Rather, they check the PSA more often and are particularly concerned about any reading that doubles within a limited time frame. I'm also glad that Jebstart has had a fruitful journey. Just wanted to suggest that he stay on the alert for any changes that may occur. Jim",

      "Content": "PC: You pose a difficult question. Could you be that one in a million who experiences a recurrence ten years after surgery? Could that be the reason you can find little info on post-surgery AS? That's hard to answer but it's impossible to argue against the factual aspects of your currently rising -- and disturbing -- PSA numbers. My recurrence happened three years after surgery. I can only suggest that, if I found myself in the same situation at ten years, I wouldn't spend a lot of time over-thinking the situation. My 40 sessions of SR was accompanied by zero side effects with the exception of some slight fatigue toward the end. You've won the battle so far. With SR, you may finally win the war.

      "Content": "Thanks, Highlander. As of last summer, my urologist and two oncology radiologists in suburban Philadelphia informed me that the \"0.2 PSA threshold following prostatectomy\" was being closely watched by their medical communities as possibly being somewhat outdated. They claimed that more recent studies have shown a moderately higher successful radiation outcome when they eyeball and evaluate any reading exceeding 0.1 PSA. That's not to say that everyone who has a reading higher than 0.1 PSA needs immediate radiation. Rather, they check the PSA more often and are particularly concerned about any reading that doubles within a limited time frame. I'm also glad that Jebstart has had a fruitful journey. Just wanted to suggest that he stay on the alert for any changes that may occur. Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome TLKai: The urologist's decision to not act until your husband's PSA level reached \"2\" is perplexing. The current industry standard following surgery is that a biochemical recurrence is recognized after two successive PSA tests that equal or exceed a reading of \"0.2\", not \"2.0\". Is it possible that there was some misunderstanding? I made my decision to pursue salvage radiation when my PSA reached 0.11 once I noticed an upward trend. As mentioned above, proton therapy is most often effective if there is a finite target and proton has no long term studies yet to support it. Your husband and I have almost a mirror image of our experiences, except that I'm two decades older. As you can see from my history, I had the DaVinci surgery in 2010, only to have the cancer return exactly 3 years later. My route with IMRT as salvage radiation encountered virtually no side effects and, while I am currently cancer-free, no one can predict the future. Whatever decisions you make from this point forward, especially with a doubling of the PSA in less than a year, should probably be made sooner rather than later. Prior to salvage treatment, however, I was required to undergo a full-body bone scan to insure that the cancer had not metastasized. Don't be alarmed if your doctor suggests the same scan as it is often viewed as medical protocol. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Michael F & Bob Smith: While the info on PSA doubling time is helpful from the standpoint of guidance, sometimes, common sense check-mates charts. For example, I didn't need a chart or a truck to hit me to observe an upward trend in my PSA post-surgery (please see below). It didn't take a rocket scientist to conclude that bad things await on the horizon if proactive measures were not implemented. As far as I was concerned, the recommendation to wait for a PSA >0.2 and rising only gives the cancer an opportunity to spread. I chose to move forward with salvage radiotherapy when my PSA reached 0.11 and it commenced at 0.16. So far, so good. Allen (Bravehardon) from Toronto had a similar view and began SR well before his PSA ever reached 0.2, also with excellent results so far (I say \"so far\" because no one ever knows what the future holds). For me, it's not a case of being right or wrong -- rather, we all need to be our own doctor to a certain degree. Jim",

Could that be the reason you can find little info on post-surgery AS? That's hard to answer but it's impossible to argue against the factual aspects of your currently rising -- and disturbing -- PSA numbers. My recurrence happened three years after surgery. I can only suggest that, if I found myself in the same situation at ten years, I wouldn't spend a lot of time over-thinking the situation. My 40 sessions of SR was accompanied by zero side effects with the exception of some slight fatigue toward the end. You've won the battle so far. With SR, you may finally win the war.

      "Content": "Now the big question is how long will this continue? Hi Osh: Looks like you are on target for a standard recovery. If you are asking how long you will receive PSA testing, my non-professional belief is that it will extend for the rest of your life (a small price to pay for the knowledge that you remain cancer free). Many post-op PC patients have their PSA tested every 3-6 months for the first year, semi-annually for the second year and annually, thereafter. Depending on the urologist, that schedule may vary somewhat. We all have different experiences with incontinence following surgery. My surgeon said his patients were completely dry, on average, at the end of two months. Lo and behold, on exactly the 60th day, I found the Land of Dryness. Don't be discouraged -- you can see the improvements from weighing your pads. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Angelmum: With respect to treatment, as you can see from my signature, I sampled a little bit of almost everything. When my PC came back three years after robotic surgery, I had 40 sessions of radiation just before I turned 71, a few years younger than your uncle. So far, my outcome has been on target (PSA=0.00) and the salvage radiotherapy I received caused no problems to speak of. A couple of caveats: my radiation dosage was focused on the remaining prostate bed so the dosage was less than for primary treatment of PC. If you do decide on radiotherapy, be wary of \"quick fixes\" of only 5 radiotherapy sessions with devices like the Cyberknife where massive doses of radiation may result in serious painful burns. I personally know of two patients who suffered burns completely through the anal wall. As long as you gather the info needed from various sources, including recommendations from others on this site who have experienced a similar scenario -- especially the age factor -- then you will gain confidence in arriving at the right treatment decision. Best of luck. Jim",

If your ultimate desire is to learn whether or not you have prostate cancer, I question why you (or anyone) would fly hundreds of miles, visit a foreign country, spend $895 for a 3T MRI test and STILL not know whether you have PC. As Chuck said, only a biopsy will give you a confirmed diagnosis of PC (assuming the biopsy sample hits active PC). But if you have lots of time and money to squander, go for it.",

Since you have not yet had a biopsy or a confirmation that you actually have PC, rest assured that we will be available at all times and at all points along the journey. Even if you do receive a confirmation, if you had to have cancer, this is the one you want because it is almost always 100% curable when found early and treated. That scenario is in contrast to other cancer patients on different threads throughout this website. As my urologist said, \"Yes, you are going to die. But not now and certainly not from this\".

      "Content": "Now the big question is how long will this continue? Hi Osh: Looks like you are on target for a standard recovery. If you are asking how long you will receive PSA testing, my non-professional belief is that it will extend for the rest of your life (a small price to pay for the knowledge that you remain cancer free). Many post-op PC patients have their PSA tested every 3-6 months for the first year, semi-annually for the second year and annually, thereafter. Depending on the urologist, that schedule may vary somewhat. We all have different experiences with incontinence following surgery. My surgeon said his patients were completely dry, on average, at the end of two months. Lo and behold, on exactly the 60th day, I found the Land of Dryness. Don't be discouraged -- you can see the improvements from weighing your pads. Best of luck, Jim",

Certainly, at age 40, cancer would be unusual, but not impossible. It seems strange that no follow-up was conducted to determine whether you responded to medication. It seems even stranger that the urologist -- especially the urologist -- would allow 2 years to pass before scheduling another PSA test while attempting to give validity to his original diagnosis. Also, do you have a family history of PC? I make these observations strictly as a layman with no medical background or credentials.",

As far as I was concerned, the recommendation to wait for a PSA >0.2 and rising only gives the cancer an opportunity to spread. I chose to move forward with salvage radiotherapy when my PSA reached 0.11 and it commenced at 0.16. So far, so good. Allen (Bravehardon) from Toronto had a similar view and began SR well before his PSA ever reached 0.2, also with excellent results so far (I say \"so far\" because no one ever knows what the future holds). For me, it's not a case of being right or wrong -- rather, we all need to be our own doctor to a certain degree. Jim",

Everyone is different with respect to the length of time you will need them, but here's a good reason to buy a lot now and trash the rest that are unneeded. My leakage ceased at the end of 60 days but during the second month when I ran short, I went to the supermarket to pick up pads. As I put the Depends on the conveyor belt at checkout, the woman in line behind me gave me a sympathetic look. I never want to see that look again -- fortunately those additional pads were sufficient to see me through. Best of luck to you, Sir, and please return to share your experience which will be helpful to others, Jim",

After a DaVinci in 2010, I followed a slow but steady PSA upward trend that caused me to decide to proceed with salvage radiation when the PSA reached 0.11. My SR actually commenced at 0.16. Good results so far, as noted below, but honestly I view cancer in general as being equivalent to the \"Whack A Mole\" game at a carnival. You knock it down and it pops up elsewhere. Nevertheless you really can't ignore a clear-cut biochemical recurrence and any doctor who tells you to wait until your PSA reaches 0.3 before seeking treatment is locked in a time warp from 1999.

      "Content": "Hi Michael: Thank you for your kind words. On my lung saga, it was my adult daughter who sells body parts (currently, heart valves) who joined my wife and I in consultation with the lung surgeon who was already sharpening his scalpel. It was a risk to wait 3 months because it could have spread. But I was actually more concerned that the removal of part of a perfectly functioning lung (I kill the breathing machine every time) could lead to an overall downward health spiral. I've seen that happen in others and it's not pretty as they struggle to breathe. Just got lucky this time, I suppose. With respect to side effects from salvage radiation, I got lucky there, also, because I've never experienced any problems whatsoever. It's good to see that you are keeping vigil on your PSA, with excellent results 3 years after your surgery. Jim",

Well, after receiving the news that my prostate biopsy showed a 3+4=7 Gleason score, I was feeling pretty sorry for myself (I've got cancer. I'm gonna die). My uro sort of played the part of Cher when he told me that there was nothing special about my diagnosis. He said that I simply had a run-of-the-mill case that they saw every day in his office and the \"cure\" rate was close to 100%. Three years after the 2010 DaVinci surgery, I had a recurrence which he was equally unimpressed by. His analogy focused on a dishwasher that didn't get all of the dishes clean the first time around and salvage radiation was employed to clean the last couple of dishes. No one can guarantee the future but I must be getting a little cocky since I finish most e-mails with \"I'm still here\". You should be fine. Best of luck. Jim",

At age 49, was this your first PSA test? Can you share your PSA details/history with us, Bernard? Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "If your uncle did not want any of the \"conventional\" treatments for prostate cancer, I must question just how much accurate information you are receiving on the subject. For example, after being \"diagnosed\" -- \"biopsy showed certain spread in the gland\" -- unknown Gleason score -- borders on the ridiculous. If he was a Gleason 9 three years ago, he is likely terminal now. And, if he was diagnosed 3 years ago with prostate cancer, how many doctors visits has he had in those 3 years to address the issue? It sounds like he has stuck his head in the sand like an ostrich for 3 years while his PSA has gotten out of control and probably metastasized (regardless of negative cat scan and bone scan) BUT that was HIS choice. Naturopathic doctors may recommend healthy foods that DO NOTHING to cure cancer BUT that was HIS choice. Sounds like he just wants to do things HIS way. Unless he has asked you to step in and help control his health care and treatment, maybe he doesn't wish any intervention.",

      "Content": "Hi Michael: Thank you for your kind words. On my lung saga, it was my adult daughter who sells body parts (currently, heart valves) who joined my wife and I in consultation with the lung surgeon who was already sharpening his scalpel. It was a risk to wait 3 months because it could have spread. But I was actually more concerned that the removal of part of a perfectly functioning lung (I kill the breathing machine every time) could lead to an overall downward health spiral. I've seen that happen in others and it's not pretty as they struggle to breathe. Just got lucky this time, I suppose. With respect to side effects from salvage radiation, I got lucky there, also, because I've never experienced any problems whatsoever. It's good to see that you are keeping vigil on your PSA, with excellent results 3 years after your surgery. Jim",

      "Content": "I had the DaVinci surgery in Nov., 2010 with a small positive margin remaining. My first post-op PSA was 0.02 that I was told was considered \"undetectable\", which, looking back was indeed detectable. By summer of 2013, the PSA had gradually risen to 0.16 at which time my urologist referred me to an oncology radiologist. Had 40 sessions of salvage radiotherapy ending in late Sept., 2013. Three months later, my first post-radiation PSA test was a true zero -- 0.00 -- and it has remained there. Finally, prostate cancer-free. The celebration lasted only 5 days in early January. Unfortunately, I have developed a nodule in my right lung middle lobe that is in a location difficult to biopsy so I need to have a \"wedge re-section\" to remove it and determine if the nodule is cancerous, while I'm still on the operating table next month. If it comes back positive, they will continue the surgery and remove my entire right middle lobe, surrounding lymph nodes and I will have chemo at a later date. Is this related to my prostate cancer? The docs say \"No\" but who the hell really knows for sure?",

      "Content": "Why use the ultrasensitive test if it does not correlate to a specific treatment regimen? Well, one reason would be that if you follow the slow progression of a biochemical recurrence, as I did (below), once the PSA reached 0.1, I was mentally prepared for the need to take action via salvage radiation. If you are kept completely in the dark with a steady reading of <0.1, there is a tendency to believe all is well when, if fact, it may not be so. And that sudden awakening to a BCR can be crushing to some patients who may have thought they were done with prostate cancer forever. Given the choice, I would always want to have too much information, rather than not enough.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by jlynn6864 I realize it is major surgery. Sorry if I ask stupid questions. Dr. Davis was great but as for the nurses, they weren't wealthy with information on what to expect and if they did try to give us any information most of them had a heavy accent that was extremely hard to understand. I've found great information on this site and if I repeat something that was already mentioned, please forgive me. I just want to give my husband the best possible care I can. Hi jlynn: The only stupid question is the one not asked. And don't be concerned about repeating a question. Most men are Neanderthals and without the help of wives like you and significant others, we would have never made it past the evolutionary stage. One suggestion (please don't be offended): when you start a new thread, many readers don't know what has transpired up to that point, so adding new posts to an existing thread is sometimes helpful. Best of luck and get ready to have a big celebration after his catheter removal. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi and welcome fx: Remember the 1987 movie \"Moonstruck\" where Cher slaps Nicholas Cage across the face and yells at him \"Snap out of it\"? Well, after receiving the news that my prostate biopsy showed a 3+4=7 Gleason score, I was feeling pretty sorry for myself (I've got cancer. I'm gonna die). My uro sort of played the part of Cher when he told me that there was nothing special about my diagnosis. He said that I simply had a run-of-the-mill case that they saw every day in his office and the \"cure\" rate was close to 100%. Three years after the 2010 DaVinci surgery, I had a recurrence which he was equally unimpressed by. His analogy focused on a dishwasher that didn't get all of the dishes clean the first time around and salvage radiation was employed to clean the last couple of dishes. No one can guarantee the future but I must be getting a little cocky since I finish most e-mails with \"I'm still here\". You should be fine. Best of luck. Jim",

He tells me that (with minimal exceptions) the ENTIRE group adheres to the following prostate cancer treatment recommendations: Under age 60: Surgery Between ages 60 and 70: Patient decides between surgery and radiation Age 70 and older: Radiation While this doesn't answer your specific inquiry, there is something to be learned here: If a patient starts to over-think an issue where most signs point in one direction, then he could easily find himself in a much worse quandary than that which he fears. There is a reason why doctors go to school for many years to learn a medical specialty -- and that's to get it right. If a patient wants to go zig while the rest of the medical community is going zag, he does so at his own risk. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome JJ: It appears that you have done an exhaustive study on the subject of incontinence. As you have found, virtually every patient is different. One poster recently mentioned that he was completely dry one week after the removal of the catheter. I wish I could give you a specific date that you would see an end to the problem but I can only share my uro's experiences. He said that, on average, his patients were dry at the end of two months. Whether I was guided by that statement, I'll never know but on exactly the 60th day after my surgery, I entered the Land of the Dry and remained there to this day. And while he encourages the use of Kegels, as do nearly all doctors and publications on the subject, my doc said that continence would indeed return with or without the use of Kegels. Kegels will just shorten the time needed to return to normal. It sounds like you are very fortunate to have a job with the flexibility to remain in the healing mode for an extended period of time. Due to the demands of your job, my only suggestion would be to maximize the time before returning to work. And, at age 62, I'll bet you are looking forward to the day when you don't have to work grueling 12-hour shifts. I was lucky to snag an early retirement program at age 53 and I'm now entering my 21st year of retirement. If I can live just 5 more years, I will have collected a pension check longer than I worked for the organization and that's my goal. All the best to you, Jim",

And then it seems you have to do a coin flip to choose the doctor that you want to mutilate or burn you. How sick is that. Sorry to be so frank in my opinion. I'm ready to deal with the after effects so I'll be flipping the coin soon. Time to move on to the rest of my life. I'm realizing that I have to develop a sense of humor to trudge through this mess to get to the GOOD SIDE. I guess comedy and tragedy really are two heads of the same coin. Steve: There is another way of looking at things. While you wear your \"Why me?\" hat, take 5 or 10 minutes and read the posts on the pancreatic cancer forum on this website. Then, come back here and bend all the way over and kiss your lucky ass that you have prostate cancer with nearly a 100% survival rate and NOT pancreatic cancer with an average 6% five-year survival rate.

      "Content": "Hi Carol: It was completely unfair of you to post that link. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop until I reached the end. If it had been in book form, it would have reeled me in like a barracuda for at least 3 days straight. You're a wonderful writer. And the active surveillance you and your husband chose is fine, but in all of your text, I saw nothing regarding Tom's Gleason score. Usually, depending on that crucial number, AS relates well to a Gleason 6, not so much to Gleason 7 or higher. And, forgive me, but the idea that AS is beneficial and somehow contributes to scientific research is a bit of a stretch. In my view (slanted as it is), contributions to science are best left to lab rats. If a car is broken and has problem processing fuel through the engine, we fix it. Ergo, if a human is broken, I'm a great believer that he should be fixed (not in the neutered sense). As you may have read on this thread before stepping forward, there are people on this site who adamantly promote surgery, others are supportive of radiation and we also have a rabid contingent of brachytherapy zealots. All of those procedures, as you have probably already researched, have pros and cons, and at the same time are maddeningly nearly equally effective. I look forward to your future comments, particularly because I have already read your pre-novel. Jim",

      "Content": "Maybe I'm a little dense but since HIFU is localized ultrasound directed at a specific site, how can a patient know if there is any residual cancer remaining in the prostate that might rear its ugly head at some later time? Is that a gamble that many people want to take? At least with surgery, you know that anything remaining in the prostate can't hurt you if the prostate itself is no longer contained in your body. Granted risk would still remain with positive margins, metastasis, etc., as I discovered when my PC returned 3 years after DaVinci.",

Secondly, with all due respect to Michael's travelogue of Boston sights (and I never disagree with Michael), I encourage you to Google the benefits of Centerfolds Boston, located on LaGrange Street, one of the highest rated strip clubs in Boston. It has 242 online reviews of which 88% are positive. With all of the crap that we have had to go through, you deserve to treat yourself to a lap dance. Of course, in the absence of a medical degree, I cannot attest to any improvement other than a 10-minute smile on your face. Wishing you the best -- always, Jim",

For example, after being \"diagnosed\" -- \"biopsy showed certain spread in the gland\" -- unknown Gleason score -- borders on the ridiculous. If he was a Gleason 9 three years ago, he is likely terminal now. And, if he was diagnosed 3 years ago with prostate cancer, how many doctors visits has he had in those 3 years to address the issue? It sounds like he has stuck his head in the sand like an ostrich for 3 years while his PSA has gotten out of control and probably metastasized (regardless of negative cat scan and bone scan) BUT that was HIS choice. Naturopathic doctors may recommend healthy foods that DO NOTHING to cure cancer BUT that was HIS choice. Sounds like he just wants to do things HIS way. Unless he has asked you to step in and help control his health care and treatment, maybe he doesn't wish any intervention.",

      "Content": "Hi Nick: Your question, as ASAdvocate notes, is certainly valid. At 4 weeks post-surgery, your PSA is likely to have decreased but may not yet reflect a true lowest-possible reading. In looking back over many post-surgery PSA tests, a reading at the three-month mark is usually more indicative of accuracy. However, if you come up with a 0.00 at the 4-week test, disregard all of the above. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Carol: It was completely unfair of you to post that link. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop until I reached the end. If it had been in book form, it would have reeled me in like a barracuda for at least 3 days straight. You're a wonderful writer. And the active surveillance you and your husband chose is fine, but in all of your text, I saw nothing regarding Tom's Gleason score. Usually, depending on that crucial number, AS relates well to a Gleason 6, not so much to Gleason 7 or higher. And, forgive me, but the idea that AS is beneficial and somehow contributes to scientific research is a bit of a stretch. In my view (slanted as it is), contributions to science are best left to lab rats. If a car is broken and has problem processing fuel through the engine, we fix it. Ergo, if a human is broken, I'm a great believer that he should be fixed (not in the neutered sense). As you may have read on this thread before stepping forward, there are people on this site who adamantly promote surgery, others are supportive of radiation and we also have a rabid contingent of brachytherapy zealots. All of those procedures, as you have probably already researched, have pros and cons, and at the same time are maddeningly nearly equally effective. I look forward to your future comments, particularly because I have already read your pre-novel. Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome PC: Your recurrence at 10 years is the longest post-surgery period that I have seen. Mine was three years prior to implementing salvage radiation. You have done an excellent job of researching your options. On the one hand, I find it interesting that both radiologists recommend their modality and the urologists say to pass at this time. So, that would leave most guys scratching their heads -- \"What to do?\" Gleason 6, notwithstanding the mantra that \"No one ever dies from Gleason 6\", with a current PSA of 0.20, it seems obvious that something is going on -- and that's not good. You've made it this far by staying on top of the problem. It would be a damn shame to guess wrong now with regard to treatment versus no treatment. Given the same circumstances, I'm pretty certain that I would opt for the SR, probably as soon as possible by using the logic that there is no obvious benefit to waiting. In fact, I would have started to get zapped at 0.1. I found SR to be a piece of cake -- no side effects whatsoever except some slight fatigue toward the end of treatment. Others have experienced side effects. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Now What?: I notice that your husband's signature path report includes the term \"PC contained\". Does that confirm there were no positive margins? We have some forum brothers who believe that a PSA of 0.03 post-surgery is evidence of a biochemical recurrence. Twenty years ago, a BCR was viewed as occurring at 0.5. Ten years ago, that number was 0.2. Four years ago when I experienced the PSA numbers creeping up post-surgery, I decided at 0.11 to move ahead with salvage radiation. So far, so good. Forty sessions - a piece of cake - just a little fatigue toward the end. If his doctor feels that a PSA every three months is reasonable, that sounds OK. However, just as I watched my PSA rise post-surgery and was prepared to act, you may want to ask his doctor at what \"trigger\" point he would recommend moving forward with salvage radiation. As \"Another\" states, sooner has been proven better that later. The only remaining question is \"How soon\". And, more importantly, whether you agree or not. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by njstol01 Do you think it should be higher or lower? If lower, might as well just irradiate all RP patients just'cause? No, not \"just 'cause\". The other criteria is the identification of a \"trend\". If you observe a progressive increase in the PSA number, that is a contributing factor to deciding whether to proceed with post-surgery follow-up treatment. There may not be current universal acceptance of a finite PSA number which should trigger a move toward salvage radiation. However, once a clear-cut PSA trend is identified in an upward trajectory, rarely will it ever return to a 0.00 reading. If I had it to do over again, I would have acted before my post-surgery PSA reached 0.1 once I saw the upward trend. But I don't know whether Medicare would have approved the $240,000 billing charge prior to 0.1. Nor do I know what minimal PSA number that will gain current approval for payment by Medicare or insurance companies for salvage radiation.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by LILDOG At what psa level is salvage radiation advised ? Does insurance usually pay when a patient is not at the recurrence level ( 0.2 and rising ) ? Is salvage radiation advised with such low levels of psa even 0.055 to keep from overtreating a patient ? Lildog: Allen and I are recipients of salvage radiotherapy following a radical prostatectomy. Don't know your history but I assume you also have had a RP. In answer to your question as to what PSA level that SR is advised, it seems to deviate among urologists with the overall belief that sooner is better than later. Again, Allen and I fall into that category. As recently as five years ago, some uros were waiting until the PSA reached 0.5 before recommending SR but I think that notion has faded in favor of a number closer to 0.2. My decision was made at 0.11 (0.16 just before SR) and as you can see from my history that has worked out well (at least for now -- no one knows what the future holds). While your numbers are still quite low, I would never suggest that they are too low to take action. As far as insurance, Medicare approved me at 0.16 but I can't offer any knowledge on the actions of other insurers. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "I understand your frustration but your reference to passing blood for weeks is far from the norm. As mentioned by others, I didn't experience any pain (discomfort, yes) but no pain and no bleeding at all. Try to think about it this way (and repeat after me): It's a diagnostic test -- it's only a diagnostic test, it's not open-heart surgery. You can do it. There's nothing special about us and we did it. Plus it has the benefit of sending each of us on a journey that, in some cases, may save our lives. This is one of only a few cancers that, if treated early, is nearly 100% curable. Many other cancers are found too late. Anxiety issues or not, this is an opportunity that should not be squandered. When you re-schedule with this doctor (who may have been dealing with an emergency) or some other doctor, explain to the staff that your level of anxiety regarding the biopsy needs to be addressed to avoid a repeat of your first experience.

      "Content": "Hi: Otago makes an excellent point on learning how many surgeries are performed annually by the operating physician. My DaVinci robotic surgery was in 11/2010 at age 68. I was quite apprehensive but surgery went smoothly and I was walking the hospital corridors just a few hours after the operation. After arriving at home following surgery, I had a portable catheter for 8 days. It was my first experience with a catheter and, while there was absolutely no pain involved, I found it to be challenging. I knew in advance that it would be necessary but I just had a hard time mentally wrapping my mind around the fact that everywhere I went, the catheter went also. I found that sleeping with the catheter was awkward. Since I was older, I asked for and received visits from home health aides every couple of days who monitored my vital signs and to try to catch anything unexpected, like an infection. No problems ever developed. For a period of about two months, you will likely need pads, similar to the brand name \"Depends\", to deal with leakage which will diminish over time. At two months following surgery, I was completely dry. As mentioned elsewhere on this thread, your Keagel exercises should be closely adhered to. I read and re-read my discharge instructions following surgery and virtually everything that was stated came through like clockwork for me. So, if I had to categorize the recovery period, I had no surprises and can confirm that the two month recovery period was considered to be textbook. Many people, I'm sure, travel with the smaller catheter -- even go to work -- but since I was retired I simply avoided that issue for the 8 days mentioned. Jim",

Welcome Steve: It is most unfortunate that you have endured such a difficult experience following a prostate biopsy. However, it is important that you recognize that this is a rare and unusual outcome and could be misleading to new patients viewing this website. Currently, a biopsy is the only methodology that can confirm the presence of cancer. The lives of millions of patients depend of knowing the results of such biopsies, so that they can move forward with treatment, if warranted. As such, your recommendation to not undergo a biopsy due to your travails is equivalent to throwing out the baby with the bath water and IMHO is inappropriate. I hope your find a speedy resolution to the symptoms you describe. Best of luck, Jim",

Walking is fine but no heavy lifting or exertion that might undo internal stitching. We are all just guys and caregivers who have been through the same thing that you have, so while we can't give medical advice, we can sometimes help others to avoid some of the pitfalls we encountered. For example, it's unfortunate that you didn't find us sooner as we would have never let you go to have the catheter removed without bringing protective guards and/or underwear. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Now What?: I notice that your husband's signature path report includes the term \"PC contained\". Does that confirm there were no positive margins? We have some forum brothers who believe that a PSA of 0.03 post-surgery is evidence of a biochemical recurrence. Twenty years ago, a BCR was viewed as occurring at 0.5. Ten years ago, that number was 0.2. Four years ago when I experienced the PSA numbers creeping up post-surgery, I decided at 0.11 to move ahead with salvage radiation. So far, so good. Forty sessions - a piece of cake - just a little fatigue toward the end. If his doctor feels that a PSA every three months is reasonable, that sounds OK. However, just as I watched my PSA rise post-surgery and was prepared to act, you may want to ask his doctor at what \"trigger\" point he would recommend moving forward with salvage radiation. As \"Another\" states, sooner has been proven better that later. The only remaining question is \"How soon\". And, more importantly, whether you agree or not. Best of luck, Jim",

At 4 weeks post-surgery, your PSA is likely to have decreased but may not yet reflect a true lowest-possible reading. In looking back over many post-surgery PSA tests, a reading at the three-month mark is usually more indicative of accuracy. However, if you come up with a 0.00 at the 4-week test, disregard all of the above. Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by njstol01 Do you think it should be higher or lower? If lower, might as well just irradiate all RP patients just'cause? No, not \"just 'cause\". The other criteria is the identification of a \"trend\". If you observe a progressive increase in the PSA number, that is a contributing factor to deciding whether to proceed with post-surgery follow-up treatment. There may not be current universal acceptance of a finite PSA number which should trigger a move toward salvage radiation. However, once a clear-cut PSA trend is identified in an upward trajectory, rarely will it ever return to a 0.00 reading. If I had it to do over again, I would have acted before my post-surgery PSA reached 0.1 once I saw the upward trend. But I don't know whether Medicare would have approved the $240,000 billing charge prior to 0.1. Nor do I know what minimal PSA number that will gain current approval for payment by Medicare or insurance companies for salvage radiation.",

Would anyone reading this post volunteer to be among the 1,000 whose lives or the lives of loved ones would be lost? Let's take this a step further mathematically: The last U.S. census of 2010 showed a population of over 308 million citizens. Of that number, about half are male (150 million). Of the 150 million men, about 30% are 55 or older (roughly 45 million). Assuming this is Day One of the PSA era, if you could save one life in every 1,000 PSA tests, then 45 million PSA tests would hypothetically result in the saving of 45,000 lives. Do we surrender 45,000 lives to avoid \"anxiety\" in others? Is this even a valid argument? I would trade unlimited \"anxiety\" for the saving of ONE LIFE, let alone 45,000 lives saved.",

Also, the first two bags fly for free on Southwest, saving about $120 a person round-trip. Another option: Check the price of a \"refundable ticket\", which is more expensive than a non-refundable ticket, BUT it will return ALL of your money if you cancel, whereas travel insurance will cost a premium. Sorry to disagree with shaww, but on virtually ALL airlines, you don't need to check cancellation policies on a \"refundable\" ticket because there are none.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by white08gt sorry to hear the bad news, I was almost there myself. I was staged T3b with positive margins, the HT will suppress the cancer. seems a little early to me to start SRT, my Urologist waited 6 months to make sure I was healed and not incontinent. I know he knows more than me but their is a chance the SRT will clean up anything left. from what I have read they likw to wait a full year before SRT or at least wait to see the PSA doubling time. there alot more on hear that have more knowledge than me that will chime in. I was given a 50/50 chance of beating this, at the least keeping it under control for a long time. your post PSA will tell a lot, I had a steady rise from 0.06 to 0.11 in 4 months time. started my HT at the end of the 4th month and took about 2 months to meet with Radiology Oncologist to schedule my SRT. your husbands age and PSA before surgery will help plus what type surgery? hope for the best Hi White: This quote from the Prostate Cancer Foundation defines the difference between salvage radiotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy: In some cases, particularly if the tumor was considered high-grade and therefore at greater risk of spreading to the surrounding areas, your doctor might decide to initiate radiation therapy right after you\u2019ve healed from your surgery. This approach, known as adjuvant therapy, typically starts about six weeks after surgery, and is unrelated to \"salvage\" radiation therapy that is administered if the PSA begins to rise. Jim",

With a Medigap policy, I never filled out a form, never paid a penny in co-pays or deductibles. And, unlike the dreaded Medicare Advantage that requires you to accept a limited network of doctors and hospitals accompanied by high co-pays and deductibles, with original Medicare and a Medigap policy you can go to any doctor and any hospital in the country that accepts Medicare.",

      "Content": "Hi RAD (hello also from Philly burbs): Sorry to hear of your situation, particularly the depression aspect. In particular, I note your listing of \"major depression\" in 2015, apparently related to hypogonadism. While I have no personal history in this area, my first suggestion would be to step back and look at the current big picture. At age 65, you are just three weeks away from having robotic surgery with a downgraded post-surgery pathology report, which for many people would be a cause for celebration, not depression. A positive margin, for most patients means virtually nothing. In your case, however, it interacts negatively with your desire to focus on your testosterone for various reasons. With all due respect, while certainly not an ideal situation, you have received the necessary treatment needed to preserve your continued existence. And that by itself, for a lot of patients, is reason enough to be thankful that you will not be among the 30,000 men who die each and every year in the U.S. from this horrible disease. To focus so greatly on the libido aspect of your case misses the point that a dead man has no need for a hard-on. If you pose the question to your significant other as to which of the two choices -- assuming only one choice can be fulfilled -- she would rather have, I feel confident that her vote would be for you to remain with us. Please keep in mind that your situation is not isolated. You are not alone -- many of us have ED problems but we are thankful to still be here. Yes, there are numerous options (injections, pumps, etc.) but each one is fighting a single battle in a war that you have already won. Your loved ones still have you to embrace and cherish. That, in itself, is enough for many people. I realize that I'm just one silly old man trying to reason with you but I'll be glad to buy you a beer and bore you to tears by telling you how I have found new meaning late in life by becoming a television poker semi-celebrity, winning major poker tournaments at ages 72, 73 and, just 11 days ago, at age 74. In August, I fly to Los Angeles on an all-expenses-paid package to play in a $3 million poker tournament. https://www.dropbox.com/s/2tgsaqzh4a...ience.mp4?dl=0 Each of us have the ability to find ways to meaningful enjoyment. All the best to you, Sir, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome PC: Your recurrence at 10 years is the longest post-surgery period that I have seen. Mine was three years prior to implementing salvage radiation. You have done an excellent job of researching your options. On the one hand, I find it interesting that both radiologists recommend their modality and the urologists say to pass at this time. So, that would leave most guys scratching their heads -- \"What to do?\" Gleason 6, notwithstanding the mantra that \"No one ever dies from Gleason 6\", with a current PSA of 0.20, it seems obvious that something is going on -- and that's not good. You've made it this far by staying on top of the problem. It would be a damn shame to guess wrong now with regard to treatment versus no treatment. Given the same circumstances, I'm pretty certain that I would opt for the SR, probably as soon as possible by using the logic that there is no obvious benefit to waiting. In fact, I would have started to get zapped at 0.1. I found SR to be a piece of cake -- no side effects whatsoever except some slight fatigue toward the end of treatment. Others have experienced side effects. Best of luck, Jim",

Yes, this thread tends to skew toward recommending surgery but the ADT then EBRT normally goes hand-in-hand with a large tumor for the purpose of reducing same prior to radiation, a more aggressive strain of PC and/or if accompanied by modest metastasis. Again, none of us are medical professionals -- we can only share our personal experiences and offer support, so you need to weigh the validity of anything that I or the other contributors recommend.

      "Content": "Welcome JJ: It appears that you have done an exhaustive study on the subject of incontinence. As you have found, virtually every patient is different. One poster recently mentioned that he was completely dry one week after the removal of the catheter. I wish I could give you a specific date that you would see an end to the problem but I can only share my uro's experiences. He said that, on average, his patients were dry at the end of two months. Whether I was guided by that statement, I'll never know but on exactly the 60th day after my surgery, I entered the Land of the Dry and remained there to this day. And while he encourages the use of Kegels, as do nearly all doctors and publications on the subject, my doc said that continence would indeed return with or without the use of Kegels. Kegels will just shorten the time needed to return to normal. It sounds like you are very fortunate to have a job with the flexibility to remain in the healing mode for an extended period of time. Due to the demands of your job, my only suggestion would be to maximize the time before returning to work. And, at age 62, I'll bet you are looking forward to the day when you don't have to work grueling 12-hour shifts. I was lucky to snag an early retirement program at age 53 and I'm now entering my 21st year of retirement. If I can live just 5 more years, I will have collected a pension check longer than I worked for the organization and that's my goal. All the best to you, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sw1218 what if the apifiny results place me in the low risk category, should i still request the 3T MRI? Since the Apifiny test was only recently made available, there is no real-time history of its accuracy or its value to patients. And it is not a stand-alone test, merely a supplement to the PSA results. For that reason, I would be inclined to not give a lot of weight to the Apifiny test when deciding how to proceed. On the other hand, a 3T MRI is a respected definitive tool that can potentially identify specific points of interest in your prostate. Your age indicates a low likelihood of PC but anything is possible. You may simply be suffering from chronic prostatitis as identified nearly 2 years ago. As noted, if your insurance covers the 3T MRI, that would likely be my first choice to avoid an unnecessary biopsy. Good luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome PC: Your recurrence at 10 years is the longest post-surgery period that I have seen. Mine was three years prior to implementing salvage radiation. You have done an excellent job of researching your options. On the one hand, I find it interesting that both radiologists recommend their modality and the urologists say to pass at this time. So, that would leave most guys scratching their heads -- \"What to do?\" Gleason 6, notwithstanding the mantra that \"No one ever dies from Gleason 6\", with a current PSA of 0.20, it seems obvious that something is going on -- and that's not good. You've made it this far by staying on top of the problem. It would be a damn shame to guess wrong now with regard to treatment versus no treatment. Given the same circumstances, I'm pretty certain that I would opt for the SR, probably as soon as possible by using the logic that there is no obvious benefit to waiting. In fact, I would have started to get zapped at 0.1. I found SR to be a piece of cake -- no side effects whatsoever except some slight fatigue toward the end of treatment. Others have experienced side effects. Best of luck, Jim",

Yes, this thread tends to skew toward recommending surgery but the ADT then EBRT normally goes hand-in-hand with a large tumor for the purpose of reducing same prior to radiation, a more aggressive strain of PC and/or if accompanied by modest metastasis. Again, none of us are medical professionals -- we can only share our personal experiences and offer support, so you need to weigh the validity of anything that I or the other contributors recommend.

      "Content": "Hi Wife: With a positive margin, as the doctor noted, there is a risk of recurrence. In my case, it returned 3 years post-surgery. With some other forum brothers, the recurrence happened quicker. By closely following my ultra-sensitive PSA results, I was able to mentally prepare and act to receive salvage radiation as soon as I saw an upward trend (please see below) before reaching a reading of 0.2. According to my doctor, this is not an unusual occurrence and not something to stress over, with respect to mortality concerns. He equated it to an automatic dishwasher that failed to wash all of the dishes the first time around (surgery) and required the last two dirty dishes to be hand-washed (salvage radiation). I sailed through the SR without any side effects or complications and my outcome has been excellent to date. My only recommendation is to keep a close watch on his PSA numbers. He may never need SR. Best of luck, Jim",

However, when you say you may have to use physical force, that's another story because you certainly don't want to take a chance that some scumbag might punch you in the lower abdomen. Also, at 4 to 6 weeks, you'll probably not want to encounter the need to climb over a high fence while pursuing a subject. For those reasons, I would suggest stretching your return time somewhat longer.",

      "Content": "Hi loves: You're right to be concerned about Gleason 9 which is advanced cancer but I'm not telling you anything that you're not already aware of. If it was wholly encapsulted in the prostate, then you can breathe easier but still must be watchful in the future. If you haven't already received it, I strongly suggest you obtain a copy of the surgical report and study it carefully. Then, if you have any questions, you can ask the doctor at the next appointment. Immediately after surgery, my doctor said he felt they got it all but in actuality they didn't (see signature below). I wasn't smart enough to ask for a copy of the surgical report which stated that the margins weren't clear. Lesson learned. Best of luck to you both. Jim",

There is a reason why doctors go to school for many years to learn a medical specialty -- and that's to get it right.

      "Content": "Hi Steven: Chuck covered it better than any of the rest of us could. You obviously have something going on but nothing that fits with anything I've ever seen before related to prostate cancer. At age 43, a PSA reading of 6 is not normal. If nothing is found and you still have problems, then a prostate biopsy may be in your future. No one welcomes the biopsy and, although most say it can't be described as painful, nevertheless, it is uncomfortable. But it is currently the ONLY way to confirm the presence of prostate cancer. Since the biopsy only reviews small sections of the prostate, sometimes the biopsy will be a false negative if it misses the actual cancer present. And I just wanted to reiterate what Chuck said about symptoms of prostate cancer. Most patients on this site never had a single symptom. They investigated only after receiving an abnormal PSA blood test reading. Thanks mainly to the widespread acceptance of PSA testing starting in 1992, overall deaths from PC have dropped 44%. We would be very interested in your outcome, PC or not. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome Samie: In closely reading your post, I note that \"open radical surgery\" was offered, but there is no mention of the operation that is most frequently utilized today, which is DaVinci robotic prostate cancer surgery. Is that because your local hospital does not offer DaVinci? Normally, I am in lock step with my forum brother, lancepeace, but with a PSA of 39, I would be inclined to act fairly quickly in order to prevent the cancer from continuing to spread. And, as Michael has pointed out, surgery is sometimes supplemented by radiation if the cancer returns or if there is reason to believe that surgery was not successful in removing the prostate with the cancer wholly encapsulated. Your post talks about \"surgery followed by probable radiation\" which is somewhat unusual, unless the doctor believes that the cancer has already escaped the prostate gland. And, your husband talks about \"downsides\" to surgery, but seems to ignore the fact that the majority of patients, after performing their due diligence and weighing the risks -- and downsides -- of all forms of treatment, select surgery more often than any other corrective methodology. However, only he and you can make the determination as to what is right for him. As noted, Dr. Walsh's book is a great first step (we receive no royalties -- not trying to sell you anything). Best of luck, Jim",

If you have surgery and the cancer returns, you can then turn to radiation to finish it off. If you choose radiation as your primary treatment and the cancer returns, surgery is not possible (except in extremely rare cases). That's what sold me on the surgery -- and lucky it did.",

      "Content": "Welcome PC: Your recurrence at 10 years is the longest post-surgery period that I have seen. Mine was three years prior to implementing salvage radiation. You have done an excellent job of researching your options. On the one hand, I find it interesting that both radiologists recommend their modality and the urologists say to pass at this time. So, that would leave most guys scratching their heads -- \"What to do?\" Gleason 6, notwithstanding the mantra that \"No one ever dies from Gleason 6\", with a current PSA of 0.20, it seems obvious that something is going on -- and that's not good. You've made it this far by staying on top of the problem. It would be a damn shame to guess wrong now with regard to treatment versus no treatment. Given the same circumstances, I'm pretty certain that I would opt for the SR, probably as soon as possible by using the logic that there is no obvious benefit to waiting. In fact, I would have started to get zapped at 0.1. I found SR to be a piece of cake -- no side effects whatsoever except some slight fatigue toward the end of treatment. Others have experienced side effects. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Thank you, Allen. My somewhat abrupt post was simply meant to say: You already had the surgery (the worst is over); Now that you've suffered a setback, how can you (with a family history of prostate cancer) not keep an open mind with respect to future treatment that can still produce a \"cure\" while others are experiencing advanced metastasis and do not have your potential life-saving options? If you are going to give up that easily, then you could have just skipped the surgery in the first place. Don't give up. You have the opportunity to break the chain of prostate cancer deaths in your family. Fight for your life. Jim",

My objective was not to ridicule but rather to bring attention to the OP's history and his total disregard for flashing red lights AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, how that impacts upon first-time visitors to this website. For example, anyone with a family history of PC, who ignores clear-cut warning signs (PSA of 10 for 5-6 years without follow-up) needs to have his case held up to the light as something that NEWBIES SHOULD NOT VIEW AS THE NORM. If it wasn't for unfiltered comments like mine \"calling out\" the OP for dereliction to saving his own life -- which, of course, is his right, any newbie reading his history could easily view it as acceptable conduct. Of all people, I don't need to remind you of the 30,000 PC deaths every year. A first-time viewer on this site could interpret haha's actions as being similar to his own and simply log off, thinking he's doing just fine, at least as well as haha.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind I also feel Jim's post is way out of line....We are not here to pass judgement on people especially when the criticism reaches the point of ridicule. Jim, that was uncalled for.... Fairwind: I understand your position. My objective was not to ridicule but rather to bring attention to the OP's history and his total disregard for flashing red lights AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, how that impacts upon first-time visitors to this website. For example, anyone with a family history of PC, who ignores clear-cut warning signs (PSA of 10 for 5-6 years without follow-up) needs to have his case held up to the light as something that NEWBIES SHOULD NOT VIEW AS THE NORM. If it wasn't for unfiltered comments like mine \"calling out\" the OP for dereliction to saving his own life -- which, of course, is his right, any newbie reading his history could easily view it as acceptable conduct. Of all people, I don't need to remind you of the 30,000 PC deaths every year. A first-time viewer on this site could interpret haha's actions as being similar to his own and simply log off, thinking he's doing just fine, at least as well as haha. If not for fat mouth geezers like me, how else would he know? Being politically correct is not always correct. Jim",

Although I know it is painful for you to imagine, is it possible that your Dad could have been shielding you from a diagnosis of a more aggressive form of prostate cancer? For example, if he had any Cat scans or full body bone scans following his initial diagnosis in 2008, they may have divulged metastasis to other areas of his body. You could start there to investigate if you are so inclined. Again, we are not doctors and at this point can only speculate. I, too, am very sorry for your loss.",

      "Content": "Hi Wife: With a positive margin, as the doctor noted, there is a risk of recurrence. In my case, it returned 3 years post-surgery. With some other forum brothers, the recurrence happened quicker. By closely following my ultra-sensitive PSA results, I was able to mentally prepare and act to receive salvage radiation as soon as I saw an upward trend (please see below) before reaching a reading of 0.2. According to my doctor, this is not an unusual occurrence and not something to stress over, with respect to mortality concerns. He equated it to an automatic dishwasher that failed to wash all of the dishes the first time around (surgery) and required the last two dirty dishes to be hand-washed (salvage radiation). I sailed through the SR without any side effects or complications and my outcome has been excellent to date. My only recommendation is to keep a close watch on his PSA numbers. He may never need SR. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi loves: You're right to be concerned about Gleason 9 which is advanced cancer but I'm not telling you anything that you're not already aware of. If it was wholly encapsulted in the prostate, then you can breathe easier but still must be watchful in the future. If you haven't already received it, I strongly suggest you obtain a copy of the surgical report and study it carefully. Then, if you have any questions, you can ask the doctor at the next appointment. Immediately after surgery, my doctor said he felt they got it all but in actuality they didn't (see signature below). I wasn't smart enough to ask for a copy of the surgical report which stated that the margins weren't clear. Lesson learned. Best of luck to you both. Jim",

Of course, if you had contracted out the yard work as I suggested BEFORE you got a nose-full of dirt leading to the infection, this episode likely would not have occurred. Please slow down. You have to take care of yourself (he said, again). Those teenage students will eventually graduate with or without your help.

      "Content": "I agree with Michael and Southsider -- very small chance of metastasis with a PSA of 6.1 and Gleason 6. The nurse is correct -- you are deemed low risk. At the same time, after re-reading your other extensive thread, I see no record of an abdominal scan or a full-body bone scan prior to your biopsy or afterwards. For many of us, those two tests were given routinely by a lot of doctors to provide a broader overall picture. Also, if the full body bone scan reveals metastasis, it MAY rule out surgery. No point in removing the prostate if the PC has spread to other areas and possibly to other organs. Was the subject of a bone scan discussed with your doctor prior to biopsy? And a full body bone scan may have offered more definitive information than a genomic prostate score that merely tries to \"assess\" the potential aggressiveness of your PC. Still, with that said, all indications are that the sky is NOT falling.",

My somewhat abrupt post was simply meant to say: You already had the surgery (the worst is over); Now that you've suffered a setback, how can you (with a family history of prostate cancer) not keep an open mind with respect to future treatment that can still produce a \"cure\" while others are experiencing advanced metastasis and do not have your potential life-saving options? If you are going to give up that easily, then you could have just skipped the surgery in the first place. Don't give up. You have the opportunity to break the chain of prostate cancer deaths in your family. Fight for your life. Jim",

My Surgeon is the Professor of Urology and my Oncologist is the Professor of Medicine and Surgery, both at the University of Arizona Cancer Center. I figured I was in good hands. I've put in a call to see if I can accelerate this treatment schedule after the comments I've received here. Nick Welcome Nick: Your stats -- age 68 and G7 (3+4, for me) at the time of surgery -- are identical to mine. Was G7 your final post-surgery pathology result, also? The comments from Michael and MM16 are highly knowledgeable but somewhat subdued compared to what you will hear from me. Picture this: bright flashing neon red lights, loud bells gonging, sirens blasting...... Now, take a look at my history that shows my salvage radiation treatment (no HT - never mentioned) BEGAN at 0.11. If your decimal places are correct on your PSA tests, as noted by Michael, your current status of PSA 1.0 without follow-up treatment is TEN TIMES WORSE than when I commenced salvage radiation. My 40 sessions of SR resulted in NO side effects with the exception of some mild fatigue toward the end. Six years after surgery and 3 years after SR, my PSA remains at 0.00. I can only conclude that there must be some other medical reasoning for not addressing your status with some ACTION. Or the acclaimed doctor you listed may be suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. Thanks to his non-action, you MAY now be past the point of cure (as mentioned) but rather are simply looking for an extension of life treatment. And, based upon your rising PSA numbers, if you don't act QUICKLY you may not get that opportunity. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Fred: One core of Gleason 6 usually falls into the AS category but every case is different, especially with an oversized prostate. Your assessment sounds on point. My urologist belongs to a group of 9 uros whose general (always exceptions) rule of thumb is \"under age 60, surgery; over age 70, radiation; between 60 and 70, a coin flip\". So, if you are now age 74 and leaning toward surgery, you should probably consider pursuing it sooner rather than later. And, with Obamacare kicking in, you could find yourself on the outside looking in, with respect to Medicare paying for the surgery. I got in under the wire at age 68 -- then salvage radiotherapy at age 71. Good luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by LetsDoThis Thanks for that sharing that. It's just so weird that it will be 2 years in November since he's had a Lupron shot....and now he's just developing the gynecomastia, never had an issue during. He's having that very same problem, rolling over and waking up to the pain. Still waiting for the oncologist call back to hear what he has to say. I'm thinking he will probably say the same thing..hormone confusion. Man does this disease really stink for you guys. I know our oncologist said he wouldn't give him testosterone but if this keeps up, I wonder if we should explore too.... We did get the Kidney stone results and they are 100% Uric Acid. So they are doing another c-scan and some blood work done to rule out anything else, but if that turns up ok, than they can start him on some meds so those don't happen again. (I really wish the stone was tested after the first attack and we could have nipped this before the other attacks...argh!) So always get those stones tested people Thanks for the welcome back Michael and Dave. I'm sorry I haven't been keeping up with this. Especially when all of you have been just so supportive and such an awesome resource too. I'll try to do a better job. I'll keep you posted if we hear anything else too Wishing everyone a Happy Memorial Day Weekend and Good PSA test results Gina Hi Gina: Five years ago, after two hospitalizations for kidney stones, including one surgery to remove a stone that completely shut down my left ureter in unbearable pain, my uro started me on a medication (Urocet-K) to hopefully prevent future kidney stone issues. It's good to have a positive outlook for the future but be advised that these horse-size pills that I choke on twice a day, are not the panacea one might hope for. In the last five years, I have been hospitalized five MORE times for severe pain from kidney stones with one incident causing surgical removal. On each of my two surgical removals, a stent had to be placed in the ureter for a week to prevent collapse. Last year, the stent failed and I was unable to urinate AT ALL -- not one drop. That led to a great personal fear of my bladder filling (without consuming any liquids) and exploding before I could be treated in the ER. Fortunately, I got to the ER in time to resolve the issue. Just picture a Roto-Rooter for a private part. My uro said that without the medication, the creation of more kidney stones would have led to even more difficulties. I mention this only so that you do not harbor unrealistic expectations for the kidney stone medication(s). Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Let me see if I understand this post correctly. Walnut is willing to surrender one thousand lives in order to avoid some anxiety!! WHAT??? Would anyone reading this post volunteer to be among the 1,000 whose lives or the lives of loved ones would be lost? Let's take this a step further mathematically: The last U.S. census of 2010 showed a population of over 308 million citizens. Of that number, about half are male (150 million). Of the 150 million men, about 30% are 55 or older (roughly 45 million). Assuming this is Day One of the PSA era, if you could save one life in every 1,000 PSA tests, then 45 million PSA tests would hypothetically result in the saving of 45,000 lives. Do we surrender 45,000 lives to avoid \"anxiety\" in others? Is this even a valid argument? I would trade unlimited \"anxiety\" for the saving of ONE LIFE, let alone 45,000 lives saved.",

      "Content": "\"If you screen men [aged 55 to 69] based on the protocol in those trials, every two to four years for 13 years, five out of 1,000 will die from prostate cancer. If you don't screen, six out of 1,000 men will die from prostate cancer,\" Bell said. \"So the reduction in prostate cancer mortality is one in 1,000 or about 0.1 per cent.\" This figure of only 1 in 1,000 lives saved by PSA tests is the same ratio cited in the U.S. task force report. Let's say the numbers are correct (which I don't really believe, but let's say they are) Now, I may not be the world's great mathematician, but that means for every one million PSA tests performed, one thousand lives will be saved. Please forgive my ignorance, perhaps I'm missing something, but isn't the saving of ONE THOUSAND LIVES a good thing?",

      "Content": "Hi David: I strongly agree with Ron. Unless you have a reason to believe that your biopsy was flawed in some way (unlikely), there appears to be no need for a second biopsy. You have extensive cancer within the prostate, albeit of the lower-risk G6 variety. And keep in mind that if you choose surgery, that G6 could possibly be upgraded to a higher number upon surgical pathological examination of the excised prostate. Surgery or radiation appears to be the logical treatment choices -- both have nearly identical successful outcomes, on average.. However, if you have a recurrence following surgery as your primary treatment, you can always revert to salvage radiation to \"clean up\" anything remaining. If you select radiation as your primary treatment, surgery is no longer an option. It was that \"second bite at the apple\" that helped to make my decision for me and, lucky that I did, because I needed salvage radiation 3 years after DaVinci surgery. What worked well for me, though, is not for everyone. Only you can decide what is the best path for yourself. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi gsteve: Glad to hear your PSA is still at zero. In many cases, \"zero\" is defined as any reading below 0.1 which is officially considered to be \"undetectable\", but may actually be detectable if you go to the second decimal. So, if you view my history at the end of my two years after DaVinci, I too was in the \"undetectable\" category at the same time that the cancer was once again beginning to rear its ugly head. Your last sentence is exactly what I would suggest. However, at the end of the 2nd year after DaVinci with no evidence of a recurrence, many uros recommend a PSA test only once a year. My feeling -- regardless of \"medical protocol\" -- especially with my history, is that I will never be comfortable waiting longer than every six months between PSA tests. Good luck, Jim",

As noted in the past, my knowledge of a PSA \"creeping\" up helped me to mentally deal with the need for salvage radiation when it came time to be zapped. As an old guy, I lean toward using analogies -- try this one: You live in Florida. You have a small inflatable pool in the back yard filled with 12 inches of water. Your 18-month-old grandchild is playing and splashing in the pool. You walk back into the house for just a few seconds. As you do, an alligator leaves a nearby swamp and heads for the pool. Question: Do you want to be alerted when the alligator is 100 yards away from the pool or just 2 yards away? Would you NOT want to know when it's 100 yards away because it may cause you \"anxiety\"?

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Nick P MichiganMan Why am I waiting? I'm following the advice I'm given. My Surgeon is the Professor of Urology and my Oncologist is the Professor of Medicine and Surgery, both at the University of Arizona Cancer Center. I figured I was in good hands. I've put in a call to see if I can accelerate this treatment schedule after the comments I've received here. Nick Welcome Nick: Your stats -- age 68 and G7 (3+4, for me) at the time of surgery -- are identical to mine. Was G7 your final post-surgery pathology result, also? The comments from Michael and MM16 are highly knowledgeable but somewhat subdued compared to what you will hear from me. Picture this: bright flashing neon red lights, loud bells gonging, sirens blasting...... Now, take a look at my history that shows my salvage radiation treatment (no HT - never mentioned) BEGAN at 0.11. If your decimal places are correct on your PSA tests, as noted by Michael, your current status of PSA 1.0 without follow-up treatment is TEN TIMES WORSE than when I commenced salvage radiation. My 40 sessions of SR resulted in NO side effects with the exception of some mild fatigue toward the end. Six years after surgery and 3 years after SR, my PSA remains at 0.00. I can only conclude that there must be some other medical reasoning for not addressing your status with some ACTION. Or the acclaimed doctor you listed may be suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. Thanks to his non-action, you MAY now be past the point of cure (as mentioned) but rather are simply looking for an extension of life treatment. And, based upon your rising PSA numbers, if you don't act QUICKLY you may not get that opportunity. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Fred: Well, your PSA is certainly nothing to be concerned about, but if two doctors have confirmed that there is an irregularity with respect to a hard nodule on your prostate, then it certainly seems prudent to investigate. A prostate biopsy is nothing more than a diagnostic tool that takes a very small sample of your prostate and sends it to the lab. A biopsy is the only test that can detect and confirm the presence of cancer in the prostate, which would be unusual at age 43 but not unheard of. Like most diagnostic tests, it is performed to rule out, not rule in, a particular disease. You could elect to do active surveillance (AS) and have the area re-checked in 3 to 6 months. Most prostate cancers are slow-growing and, therefore, a delay may be reasonable. However, there are also less frequent strains of prostate cancer that are fast-moving and can actually kill you rather quickly. So, if you delay, you are accepting somewhat of a risk. I would view your description of a biopsy as \"overwhelming\" to be somewhat overstated. The test is frequently performed in the doctor's office and takes about ten minutes to complete. There is rarely pain involved, but the procedure is uncomfortable and you may be sore for 24-48 hours. The test is not life-threatening. Others will follow with additional info. Please let us know how you make out. Good luck. Jim",

Nick Welcome Nick: Your stats -- age 68 and G7 (3+4, for me) at the time of surgery -- are identical to mine. Was G7 your final post-surgery pathology result, also? The comments from Michael and MM16 are highly knowledgeable but somewhat subdued compared to what you will hear from me. Picture this: bright flashing neon red lights, loud bells gonging, sirens blasting...... Now, take a look at my history that shows my salvage radiation treatment (no HT - never mentioned) BEGAN at 0.11. If your decimal places are correct on your PSA tests, as noted by Michael, your current status of PSA 1.0 without follow-up treatment is TEN TIMES WORSE than when I commenced salvage radiation. My 40 sessions of SR resulted in NO side effects with the exception of some mild fatigue toward the end. Six years after surgery and 3 years after SR, my PSA remains at 0.00. I can only conclude that there must be some other medical reasoning for not addressing your status with some ACTION. Or the acclaimed doctor you listed may be suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. Thanks to his non-action, you MAY now be past the point of cure (as mentioned) but rather are simply looking for an extension of life treatment. And, based upon your rising PSA numbers, if you don't act QUICKLY you may not get that opportunity. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Fred: Well, your PSA is certainly nothing to be concerned about, but if two doctors have confirmed that there is an irregularity with respect to a hard nodule on your prostate, then it certainly seems prudent to investigate. A prostate biopsy is nothing more than a diagnostic tool that takes a very small sample of your prostate and sends it to the lab. A biopsy is the only test that can detect and confirm the presence of cancer in the prostate, which would be unusual at age 43 but not unheard of. Like most diagnostic tests, it is performed to rule out, not rule in, a particular disease. You could elect to do active surveillance (AS) and have the area re-checked in 3 to 6 months. Most prostate cancers are slow-growing and, therefore, a delay may be reasonable. However, there are also less frequent strains of prostate cancer that are fast-moving and can actually kill you rather quickly. So, if you delay, you are accepting somewhat of a risk. I would view your description of a biopsy as \"overwhelming\" to be somewhat overstated. The test is frequently performed in the doctor's office and takes about ten minutes to complete. There is rarely pain involved, but the procedure is uncomfortable and you may be sore for 24-48 hours. The test is not life-threatening. Others will follow with additional info. Please let us know how you make out. Good luck. Jim",

There is no explanation as to whether overexertion may have been a factor, but if it was, then your experience should be a clarion call to others to take it easy following surgery.

      "Content": "Hi mcnova: Welcome to the forum. Sorry you and your father have a need to be here. I can identify with his situation as I was also age 67 (see signature history below) when diagnosed with PC and my PSA level was similar. There are a number of suggestions that you will receive from those who come after me (surgery, radiation, etc.) on this site so I will speak only of the question you asked about waiting for higher scores before initiating treatment. My opinion: Don't. While surgery remains an option now, in a relatively short time, it may be one of the options taken off of the table as he reaches age 70. At that point, radiation may be the only hope for a \"cure\". And, to compound the dilemma, if he has surgery and the cancer returns (as mine did), he can then have salvage radiotherapy to eradicate the remaining cancer. On the other hand, if he selects radiation, he cannot (except in very rare instances) have surgery next because the prostate is deformed during radiation in such a way as to not permit surgery. Another issue is the Gleason 6 diagnosis; treatment now is almost always 100% successful as you read in Dr. Walsh's book. But a higher Gleason score may be indicative of a less successful outcome as it will possibly reveal a more aggressive strain of PC and/or show that the cancer has already spread to surrounding lymph nodes and, potentially, other organs. Right or wrong, I have never been a proponent of active surveillance. Nothing good can ever happen as the cancer isn't magically going to go away. Best of luck and I hope you find the info you seek and convince your Dad that action is indeed warranted at this point. Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome bassoneman: Over the next several days, you should expect to hear from patients and their care-givers who have already experienced the path that you are approaching. With luck, it will be as uneventful as my journey was, which was secondary, or salvage radiation, three years after surgery. A number of oncologists like to have patients with a full bladder prior to your 10-12 minute daily zap. Zap refers to radiation, not physical contact -- you will feel nothing as the machine circles around you, assuming you are receiving IMRT treatment. Originally, I had a 30-minute drive to receive my salvage radiation over two major highways that sometimes wind up in gridlock. I didn't like that scenario, as I was certain that I could not hold the fluid very long.. Instead, I found a highly skilled radiation oncologist just six minutes from home who did not require a full bladder. Finding him was like hitting a home run with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth. My best wish for you is that you find someone just like my RO. Some patients experience minor side effects with IMRT but my only SE was some very slight fatigue toward the end of my 40 sessions. It's been 3 1/2 years since my SR and as you can see from my signature, all looks well so far. Just had my latest PSA on Tuesday -- will get the results at the beginning of next week. You've found a group of very caring people who will be available to you with any help they can provide. All the best to you, Sir, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Nick P MichiganMan Why am I waiting? I'm following the advice I'm given. My Surgeon is the Professor of Urology and my Oncologist is the Professor of Medicine and Surgery, both at the University of Arizona Cancer Center. I figured I was in good hands. I've put in a call to see if I can accelerate this treatment schedule after the comments I've received here. Nick Welcome Nick: Your stats -- age 68 and G7 (3+4, for me) at the time of surgery -- are identical to mine. Was G7 your final post-surgery pathology result, also? The comments from Michael and MM16 are highly knowledgeable but somewhat subdued compared to what you will hear from me. Picture this: bright flashing neon red lights, loud bells gonging, sirens blasting...... Now, take a look at my history that shows my salvage radiation treatment (no HT - never mentioned) BEGAN at 0.11. If your decimal places are correct on your PSA tests, as noted by Michael, your current status of PSA 1.0 without follow-up treatment is TEN TIMES WORSE than when I commenced salvage radiation. My 40 sessions of SR resulted in NO side effects with the exception of some mild fatigue toward the end. Six years after surgery and 3 years after SR, my PSA remains at 0.00. I can only conclude that there must be some other medical reasoning for not addressing your status with some ACTION. Or the acclaimed doctor you listed may be suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. Thanks to his non-action, you MAY now be past the point of cure (as mentioned) but rather are simply looking for an extension of life treatment. And, based upon your rising PSA numbers, if you don't act QUICKLY you may not get that opportunity. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi David: I strongly agree with Ron. Unless you have a reason to believe that your biopsy was flawed in some way (unlikely), there appears to be no need for a second biopsy. You have extensive cancer within the prostate, albeit of the lower-risk G6 variety. And keep in mind that if you choose surgery, that G6 could possibly be upgraded to a higher number upon surgical pathological examination of the excised prostate. Surgery or radiation appears to be the logical treatment choices -- both have nearly identical successful outcomes, on average.. However, if you have a recurrence following surgery as your primary treatment, you can always revert to salvage radiation to \"clean up\" anything remaining. If you select radiation as your primary treatment, surgery is no longer an option. It was that \"second bite at the apple\" that helped to make my decision for me and, lucky that I did, because I needed salvage radiation 3 years after DaVinci surgery. What worked well for me, though, is not for everyone. Only you can decide what is the best path for yourself. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "\"However if the tumers start to grow at anytime they will move you into the treatment side of the study.\" Wow! If accurate, this almost borders on the bizarre. I am in 100% agreement with Michael F who is able to express his opinion much more eloquently than I am able to or inclined to. As a non-medical professional, I have always operated under the assumption that trials are primarily for patients who have already exhausted all reasonable means of potential cure. If metastases was wide-spread, then little would be left to interpretation. However, a single small spot on the lower back that tests positive makes me wince. What if it's a false positive? In this case, if I understand it correctly, the trial will give you a 50/50 chance of \"treatment\". Please forgive my bluntness, but if it was me, my knee-jerk response would be, \"Screw that\". Why be a guinea pig if treatment is still an option? Unless I am deemed to be terminal, I would want - no, I would demand - a 100% chance of treatment IMMEDIATELY. Am I missing something here? I truly wish you the very best, Sir, Jim",

You have extensive cancer within the prostate, albeit of the lower-risk G6 variety. And keep in mind that if you choose surgery, that G6 could possibly be upgraded to a higher number upon surgical pathological examination of the excised prostate. Surgery or radiation appears to be the logical treatment choices -- both have nearly identical successful outcomes, on average.. However, if you have a recurrence following surgery as your primary treatment, you can always revert to salvage radiation to \"clean up\" anything remaining. If you select radiation as your primary treatment, surgery is no longer an option. It was that \"second bite at the apple\" that helped to make my decision for me and, lucky that I did, because I needed salvage radiation 3 years after DaVinci surgery.

      "Content": "No, it's not early. You don't need a \"better view of trending\". YOU ALREADY HAVE A TREND. In the past, a post-surgery PSA reading of at least 0.2 at least twice was considered a confirmation of a biochemical recurrence. Many doctors have now trashed that and encourage commencement of salvage radiation at or near 0.1. Please review my history. Upon reaching 0.11 three years after surgery, I immediately started SR and, so far at least, it's worked out well. Don't screw around with this. Make an appointment with your surgeon to discuss his confirmation of a quick 7-month failure and his recommendations for a resolution. OR skip the surgeon and go directly to a radiology oncologist. You have touched on the fallacy of traditional one-numerical-decimal PSA testing wanting to avoid \"unnecessary concerns or anxiety\". Keeping a patient in the dark relative to a rising post-surgery PSA, IMHO, is like an ostrich sticking its head in the sand. It's like having a leak in your gas tank and not wanting to know that your car is about to blow up. Note: Thanks, Michael. Our posts passed in the interim.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Nick P MichiganMan Why am I waiting? I'm following the advice I'm given. My Surgeon is the Professor of Urology and my Oncologist is the Professor of Medicine and Surgery, both at the University of Arizona Cancer Center. I figured I was in good hands. I've put in a call to see if I can accelerate this treatment schedule after the comments I've received here. Nick Welcome Nick: Your stats -- age 68 and G7 (3+4, for me) at the time of surgery -- are identical to mine. Was G7 your final post-surgery pathology result, also? The comments from Michael and MM16 are highly knowledgeable but somewhat subdued compared to what you will hear from me. Picture this: bright flashing neon red lights, loud bells gonging, sirens blasting...... Now, take a look at my history that shows my salvage radiation treatment (no HT - never mentioned) BEGAN at 0.11. If your decimal places are correct on your PSA tests, as noted by Michael, your current status of PSA 1.0 without follow-up treatment is TEN TIMES WORSE than when I commenced salvage radiation. My 40 sessions of SR resulted in NO side effects with the exception of some mild fatigue toward the end. Six years after surgery and 3 years after SR, my PSA remains at 0.00. I can only conclude that there must be some other medical reasoning for not addressing your status with some ACTION. Or the acclaimed doctor you listed may be suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. Thanks to his non-action, you MAY now be past the point of cure (as mentioned) but rather are simply looking for an extension of life treatment. And, based upon your rising PSA numbers, if you don't act QUICKLY you may not get that opportunity. Best of luck, Jim",

And then it seems you have to do a coin flip to choose the doctor that you want to mutilate or burn you. How sick is that. Sorry to be so frank in my opinion. I'm ready to deal with the after effects so I'll be flipping the coin soon. Time to move on to the rest of my life. I'm realizing that I have to develop a sense of humor to trudge through this mess to get to the GOOD SIDE. I guess comedy and tragedy really are two heads of the same coin. Steve: There is another way of looking at things. While you wear your \"Why me?\" hat, take 5 or 10 minutes and read the posts on the pancreatic cancer forum on this website. Then, come back here and bend all the way over and kiss your lucky ass that you have prostate cancer with nearly a 100% survival rate and NOT pancreatic cancer with an average 6% five-year survival rate.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by GunsmokeFan Jim215: thank you for your reply. How would we find out what percentage of patients choose this? or any treatment? And do you know how we could find statistics of rates of side affects (other than maybe what the doctor who does the focal cryotherapy may say)? Hi GF: Sorry for the delay in responding. It appeared to me from your husband's profile with multiple listings of PSA tests and an absence of primary treatment that your inquiry related to considering cryotherapy as primary treatment. Of course, Pratoman had the good sense to ask whether it was primary or secondary. Since my guess without research was that only about 2% of prostate cancer patients elect to have cryotherapy, I did a Google search. And I found that among all PC patients (primary and secondary), cryotherapy is selected by......2% of the men. It is described on many health care sites as being\"...a viable alternative among a paucity of choices for patients who experience a biochemical recurrence after failed primary radiation treatment.\" As far as specific side effects, I wish I could provide some info but I do not have the resources to do so with any level of confidence. My first reaction was to being uncomfortable with the recommendations of \"celebrity\" doctors, like Dr. Katz and Dr. Oz on television who sometimes cloud an issue that may be quite straightforward. For example, Dr. Katz has stated that \"over 80%\" of prostate cancer patients do NOT need surgery or radiation as their primary treatment and he seems to have his own objectives by creating active surveillance foundations and selling books. Yes, there can be unwanted, sometimes quite serious, side effects from surgery or radiation, but PC kills 30,000 men every year and any attempt to guide patients away from primary treatment -- without examining the patient in person -- just rubs me the wrong way.",

      "Content": "Hi Izicc: Welcome to the forum. You will find a fine group of caring people here who will readily share their personal experiences and provide information to the best of their ability. There are no conflicts of interest because no one is trying to sell you anything. At the same time, you may find posters who are in favor of a particular type of treatment, more so than an alternative, and that's OK because it worked for them. My only comments are: The nurse is correct that once the prostate is removed, the cancerous gland is gone but it's still very important to watch your PSA results post-surgery as the cancer can return (as shown in my history/signature below). One of the major benefits of having surgery instead of radiation (there's my bias kicking in) is that you can have salvage radiation after surgery but not surgery after radiation -- except in very rare cases. And it is also possible that your preliminary Gleason 6 could actually be pathologically upgraded to Gleason 7 post-surgery. Your doctor will be able to tell you his protocol for removal of lymph nodes (some docs take more than others). Best of luck to you and please keep us updated with your decisions/treatment/outcome which may be helpful to others. Jim",

There is no explanation as to whether overexertion may have been a factor, but if it was, then your experience should be a clarion call to others to take it easy following surgery.

My take is this: why the hell is ANYONE talking about testing when -- as Chuck pointed out -- the patient has ALREADY been CONFIRMED to have prostate cancer. Instead of worrying whether something bad is going on with a constantly rising PSA -- \"What should I do? What should I do?\", to me, the answer is rudimentary: get it the hell out of there and let post-surgery pathology figure out what's actually in there. If I was the patient, with two brothers with PC, I would be shopping this morning at Wal-Mart for a robe and slippers for my overnight hospital stay following surgery.

It's not impossible but it is unlikely in your husband's case with Gleason 6 & 7s. And a 3+4=7 Gleason score is better than a 4+3=7 score. The former is what both your husband and I presented. My urologist said that I shouldn't feel special because a 3+4=7 Gleason is just the run-of-the-mill type of cancer seen every day in his office. Not a big deal. Treat it and move on just like it never happened. Of course, you will want to arm yourself with enough info to proceed. Our moderator, Chuck, should be along shortly to fill in the basics.

      "Content": "Hi PDV: First, let me say that you have pinpointed the target in the \"big picture\". We're still here. Sometimes on this site, as the months go by after treatment, there is a tendency in some quarters to complain about various side issues of this disease, some temporary, some permanent. What they often overlook is that they would have nothing to whine about if they weren't still around. Positive margins, for the most part, usually mean nothing. Sometimes, it can be a precursor to the return of PC as it was in my case, three years after surgery. But, even then, it can usually be addressed with salvage radiation to \"clean up\" anything remaining. For me, it was important to keep a close eye on the PSA tests and to act sooner employing salvage radiation, rather than later if you detect an upward trend in the numbers. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Ron: Prior to my DaVinci surgery, I never had a catheter before -- didn't know how they worked -- didn't care as long as I didn't have one. There is no need to freak out because it's really a non-issue. Just like folks carry a smart phone everywhere today, the catheter goes everywhere with you. I experienced zero pain and zero discomfort with it but it was a nuisance, on the level that a barking dog next dog is a nuisance. When it's time to remove it (and you will be counting down the days), you just take a deep breath, blow out and the physician or nurse will painlessly slip it out. REALLY, not a big deal. A moderate annoyance, at best. I found that sleeping in a large recliner with the catheter bag on the floor (or in a bucket) to be superior to trying to sleep in bed and worrying that tossing and turning might somehow dislodge the catheter. Some patients actually try to function normally as if they didn't have the catheter by switching to the smaller leg bag retainer and going out to public places. I suppose that's where I fall into the wimp category because I was not nearly so courageous, electing instead to stay home until it was time for the catheter to be removed. Best of luck, Jim",

It's the way that most engineers (I'm not one) analyze a major problem and work toward a solution which is to first break things down into smaller components. The results of the full-body bone scan on Monday will be most helpful because it will assist in being able to rule-in or rule-out certain methodologies in proceeding with treatment. And, as you have likely learned, some form of treatment or combination of treatments will be needed with his Gleason 8 diagnosis. No one here will sugarcoat the fact that G8 is an aggressive form of prostate cancer. But there is absolutely no reason to feel \"hopeless\". If your husband had to have cancer, this is the one he wants. Prostate cancer has very high survival rates and even in a worst case scenario, if a \"cure\" is not possible, the number of treatments available will often allow for a full life span. That's not to be taken lightly as, for example, a pancreatic cancer patient is looking at an average 6% five-year survival rate following diagnosis. Please let us know the results of the bone scan.

In addition to all men being pigs, they are also inherently stupid, as in you sometimes must drag a thirsty horse to a watering hole. By age 58, I had spent a lifetime avoiding a DRE. My philosophy was adamant -- that's an \"exit only\" location. Don't even think about suggesting it to me. Somehow, with different doctors retiring and doctors' practices consolidating, I wound up with a female doctor named Maria, a tiny Italian girl with a bright disposition. As I was putting on my shirt after a routine exam, she said we weren't done yet and pulled on a plastic glove. I explained my position on the subject and respectfully declined. She walked to the door and locked it. She told me that I would have to throw her to the floor before she would allow me to leave without a DRE. Then, she held her gloved hand in front of my face and said, \"Jim, look at my hand. I'm 99 pounds and my fingers are almost skeletal thin. You need to have this exam at your age. Who would you rather perform it? Me or some male doctor who is 260 pounds with fat, stubby fingers?\". Oh, Maria. Yes, I caved. It was followed shortly thereafter by a colonoscopy that I had deathly feared (which wound up being so easy it was unbelievable - go to sleep, wake up to a cold orange juice). And a decade later, the PSA test that detected prostate cancer. Please advise your bf that he doesn't have a monopoly on stupidity, but there may be hope yet. Jim",

Would anyone reading this post volunteer to be among the 1,000 whose lives or the lives of loved ones would be lost? Let's take this a step further mathematically: The last U.S. census of 2010 showed a population of over 308 million citizens. Of that number, about half are male (150 million). Of the 150 million men, about 30% are 55 or older (roughly 45 million). Assuming this is Day One of the PSA era, if you could save one life in every 1,000 PSA tests, then 45 million PSA tests would hypothetically result in the saving of 45,000 lives. Do we surrender 45,000 lives to avoid \"anxiety\" in others? Is this even a valid argument? I would trade unlimited \"anxiety\" for the saving of ONE LIFE, let alone 45,000 lives saved.",

Walking is fine but no heavy lifting or exertion that might undo internal stitching. We are all just guys and caregivers who have been through the same thing that you have, so while we can't give medical advice, we can sometimes help others to avoid some of the pitfalls we encountered. For example, it's unfortunate that you didn't find us sooner as we would have never let you go to have the catheter removed without bringing protective guards and/or underwear. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "I understand your frustration but your reference to passing blood for weeks is far from the norm. As mentioned by others, I didn't experience any pain (discomfort, yes) but no pain and no bleeding at all. Try to think about it this way (and repeat after me): It's a diagnostic test -- it's only a diagnostic test, it's not open-heart surgery. You can do it. There's nothing special about us and we did it. Plus it has the benefit of sending each of us on a journey that, in some cases, may save our lives. This is one of only a few cancers that, if treated early, is nearly 100% curable. Many other cancers are found too late. Anxiety issues or not, this is an opportunity that should not be squandered. When you re-schedule with this doctor (who may have been dealing with an emergency) or some other doctor, explain to the staff that your level of anxiety regarding the biopsy needs to be addressed to avoid a repeat of your first experience.

      "Content": "Hi Carol: It was completely unfair of you to post that link. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop until I reached the end. If it had been in book form, it would have reeled me in like a barracuda for at least 3 days straight. You're a wonderful writer. And the active surveillance you and your husband chose is fine, but in all of your text, I saw nothing regarding Tom's Gleason score. Usually, depending on that crucial number, AS relates well to a Gleason 6, not so much to Gleason 7 or higher. And, forgive me, but the idea that AS is beneficial and somehow contributes to scientific research is a bit of a stretch. In my view (slanted as it is), contributions to science are best left to lab rats. If a car is broken and has problem processing fuel through the engine, we fix it. Ergo, if a human is broken, I'm a great believer that he should be fixed (not in the neutered sense). As you may have read on this thread before stepping forward, there are people on this site who adamantly promote surgery, others are supportive of radiation and we also have a rabid contingent of brachytherapy zealots. All of those procedures, as you have probably already researched, have pros and cons, and at the same time are maddeningly nearly equally effective. I look forward to your future comments, particularly because I have already read your pre-novel. Jim",

      "Content": "I understand your frustration but your reference to passing blood for weeks is far from the norm. As mentioned by others, I didn't experience any pain (discomfort, yes) but no pain and no bleeding at all. Try to think about it this way (and repeat after me): It's a diagnostic test -- it's only a diagnostic test, it's not open-heart surgery. You can do it. There's nothing special about us and we did it. Plus it has the benefit of sending each of us on a journey that, in some cases, may save our lives. This is one of only a few cancers that, if treated early, is nearly 100% curable. Many other cancers are found too late. Anxiety issues or not, this is an opportunity that should not be squandered. When you re-schedule with this doctor (who may have been dealing with an emergency) or some other doctor, explain to the staff that your level of anxiety regarding the biopsy needs to be addressed to avoid a repeat of your first experience. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Wife: With a positive margin, as the doctor noted, there is a risk of recurrence. In my case, it returned 3 years post-surgery. With some other forum brothers, the recurrence happened quicker. By closely following my ultra-sensitive PSA results, I was able to mentally prepare and act to receive salvage radiation as soon as I saw an upward trend (please see below) before reaching a reading of 0.2. According to my doctor, this is not an unusual occurrence and not something to stress over, with respect to mortality concerns. He equated it to an automatic dishwasher that failed to wash all of the dishes the first time around (surgery) and required the last two dirty dishes to be hand-washed (salvage radiation). I sailed through the SR without any side effects or complications and my outcome has been excellent to date. My only recommendation is to keep a close watch on his PSA numbers. He may never need SR. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome JJ: It appears that you have done an exhaustive study on the subject of incontinence. As you have found, virtually every patient is different. One poster recently mentioned that he was completely dry one week after the removal of the catheter. I wish I could give you a specific date that you would see an end to the problem but I can only share my uro's experiences. He said that, on average, his patients were dry at the end of two months. Whether I was guided by that statement, I'll never know but on exactly the 60th day after my surgery, I entered the Land of the Dry and remained there to this day. And while he encourages the use of Kegels, as do nearly all doctors and publications on the subject, my doc said that continence would indeed return with or without the use of Kegels. Kegels will just shorten the time needed to return to normal. It sounds like you are very fortunate to have a job with the flexibility to remain in the healing mode for an extended period of time. Due to the demands of your job, my only suggestion would be to maximize the time before returning to work. And, at age 62, I'll bet you are looking forward to the day when you don't have to work grueling 12-hour shifts. I was lucky to snag an early retirement program at age 53 and I'm now entering my 21st year of retirement. If I can live just 5 more years, I will have collected a pension check longer than I worked for the organization and that's my goal. All the best to you, Jim",

      "Content": "So often you hear that there is no need to act on the discovery of prostate cancer because \"...it's likely something else will kill you first\". But prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the U.S. (estimated 29,480 deaths in 2014). That's a pretty impressive number. If you have the opportunity to catch it early and get rid of it, it just seems logical that you would want to do that. Because, as you get older, if nothing else DOES kill you first, then the prostate cancer absolutely will be your demise. If I had it to do over again, I would LEAP onto the operating table. Well, at my age, it would be more of a semi-leap.",

We're just a bunch of strangers from around the world who have had similar experiences and whose backgrounds may serve to aid each other, albeit in a non-medical expert environment. Before I retired, 300 people reported to me. Now, I can't get the dog to come in out of the rain. The idea of joining a forum or support group had always been foreign to me. I was always a leader, rarely a follower. \"They\" were just people who sat around saying \"Oh, woe is me\" and lamenting their misfortune. How wrong I was -- at least with respect to this group. With the exception of only a few isolated incidents, I have seen nothing but caring and compassion and a true desire to be of benefit to others, if possible. This mindset is personified by our esteemed moderator, Chuck, who tirelessly maintains an even-keel approach in dealing with so many different personalities.

      "Content": "So often you hear that there is no need to act on the discovery of prostate cancer because \"...it's likely something else will kill you first\". But prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the U.S. (estimated 29,480 deaths in 2014). That's a pretty impressive number. If you have the opportunity to catch it early and get rid of it, it just seems logical that you would want to do that. Because, as you get older, if nothing else DOES kill you first, then the prostate cancer absolutely will be your demise. If I had it to do over again, I would LEAP onto the operating table. Well, at my age, it would be more of a semi-leap.",

For example, after being \"diagnosed\" -- \"biopsy showed certain spread in the gland\" -- unknown Gleason score -- borders on the ridiculous. If he was a Gleason 9 three years ago, he is likely terminal now. And, if he was diagnosed 3 years ago with prostate cancer, how many doctors visits has he had in those 3 years to address the issue? It sounds like he has stuck his head in the sand like an ostrich for 3 years while his PSA has gotten out of control and probably metastasized (regardless of negative cat scan and bone scan) BUT that was HIS choice. Naturopathic doctors may recommend healthy foods that DO NOTHING to cure cancer BUT that was HIS choice. Sounds like he just wants to do things HIS way. Unless he has asked you to step in and help control his health care and treatment, maybe he doesn't wish any intervention.",

It's the way that most engineers (I'm not one) analyze a major problem and work toward a solution which is to first break things down into smaller components. The results of the full-body bone scan on Monday will be most helpful because it will assist in being able to rule-in or rule-out certain methodologies in proceeding with treatment. And, as you have likely learned, some form of treatment or combination of treatments will be needed with his Gleason 8 diagnosis. No one here will sugarcoat the fact that G8 is an aggressive form of prostate cancer. But there is absolutely no reason to feel \"hopeless\". If your husband had to have cancer, this is the one he wants. Prostate cancer has very high survival rates and even in a worst case scenario, if a \"cure\" is not possible, the number of treatments available will often allow for a full life span. That's not to be taken lightly as, for example, a pancreatic cancer patient is looking at an average 6% five-year survival rate following diagnosis. Please let us know the results of the bone scan.

Apparently, Blue Cross/Blue Shield remains back in the Stone Age. One thing jumps out at me. Because of the extra expense involved with proton therapy treatment, I would have guessed that BC/BS would have required you to receive a pre-approval letter from them prior to treatment. Now, nearly a year after treatment commenced, they mail you a \"Screw You\" letter? That's just not right. I would consult an attorney. Good luck, Jim",

It's the way that most engineers (I'm not one) analyze a major problem and work toward a solution which is to first break things down into smaller components. The results of the full-body bone scan on Monday will be most helpful because it will assist in being able to rule-in or rule-out certain methodologies in proceeding with treatment. And, as you have likely learned, some form of treatment or combination of treatments will be needed with his Gleason 8 diagnosis. No one here will sugarcoat the fact that G8 is an aggressive form of prostate cancer. But there is absolutely no reason to feel \"hopeless\". If your husband had to have cancer, this is the one he wants. Prostate cancer has very high survival rates and even in a worst case scenario, if a \"cure\" is not possible, the number of treatments available will often allow for a full life span. That's not to be taken lightly as, for example, a pancreatic cancer patient is looking at an average 6% five-year survival rate following diagnosis. Please let us know the results of the bone scan.

      "Content": "Oh, brother. I would love to be a fly on the wall as you explain to the wife-unit that some stranger on the Internet named \"ddayglo\" insists that you MUST have as much sex as possible RIGHT NOW. Not that I disagree, but that should be quite an encounter. You've probably read about government panels stating that unnecessary PSA tests and biopsies lead some men to have treatments/radiation/surgeries that lead to possible impotence and incontinence. And that something other than prostate cancer will likely kill you first. What they never mention is that if something else doesn't kill you first, then prostate cancer will indeed kill you. Prior to my DaVinci surgery, my Gleason score was 3+4=7 and it was explained to me that most men under 60 have surgery and most men over 70 have radiation. Between ages 60 and 70, the patient is left to decide. At age 68, I decided on the surgery. For me, it was a no-brainer. During the same month as my diagnosis, a local university president died of prostate cancer. He was also age 68. I know I'm not as smart as a university president but, apparently, he wasn't smart enough to have a PSA test. As noted above, at your age, surgery seems to be the right choice but you would serve yourself and your family well by doing as much due diligence as possible to consider the potential for unexpected outcomes. A Gleason score of 6 means you are not in imminent danger. You have time. It's very likely that your decision will remain the same and that's fine. I wish you the best. Jim",

It has 242 online reviews of which 88% are positive. With all of the crap that we have had to go through, you deserve to treat yourself to a lap dance.

Sometimes on this site, as the months go by after treatment, there is a tendency in some quarters to complain about various side issues of this disease, some temporary, some permanent. What they often overlook is that they would have nothing to whine about if they weren't still around. Positive margins, for the most part, usually mean nothing. Sometimes, it can be a precursor to the return of PC as it was in my case, three years after surgery. But, even then, it can usually be addressed with salvage radiation to \"clean up\" anything remaining. For me, it was important to keep a close eye on the PSA tests and to act sooner employing salvage radiation, rather than later if you detect an upward trend in the numbers. Best of luck, Jim",

At age 68, my hypertension and high cholesterol was well controlled by medication. I chose DaVinci robotic surgery. Zero side effects. Catheter bag at home for 8 days was a nuisance. But here's a primary consideration for making a decision of surgery or radiation: If you select surgery and the cancer returns, your Dad can then have radiation (as I did - see below). If you select radiation and the cancer returns, your Dad (except in very rare instances) cannot have surgery. During surgery, the prostate is removed as if very carefully peeling an orange. Radiation tends to destroy that possibility. Gather as much info as possible before deciding. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "From Wikipedia: \"Finasteride, sold under the brand names Proscar and Propecia among others, is a medication used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate).\" As a non-medical professional, this is probably a dumb question, but your use of Finasteride is somewhat puzzling to me. If the primary application of Finasteride is for treatment of an enlarged prostate, why would you use it in the absence of a prostate? Combined with the addition of Pomi-T, you may successfully have MASKED the neon red blinking warning signs of increasing PSA numbers that \u201ccould\u201d lead to life-saving salvage radiation. Congratulations -- NOT. The manipulated reduction in your PSA number post-surgery is counter-productive. Reducing the PSA number has no effect on the actual spread of prostate cancer. If you do reach the point of experiencing pain (hopefully this will not be the case), it may be from cancer metastasizing to the bones. And that's not a good thing.",

      "Content": "Hi Steven: Chuck covered it better than any of the rest of us could. You obviously have something going on but nothing that fits with anything I've ever seen before related to prostate cancer. At age 43, a PSA reading of 6 is not normal. If nothing is found and you still have problems, then a prostate biopsy may be in your future. No one welcomes the biopsy and, although most say it can't be described as painful, nevertheless, it is uncomfortable. But it is currently the ONLY way to confirm the presence of prostate cancer. Since the biopsy only reviews small sections of the prostate, sometimes the biopsy will be a false negative if it misses the actual cancer present. And I just wanted to reiterate what Chuck said about symptoms of prostate cancer. Most patients on this site never had a single symptom. They investigated only after receiving an abnormal PSA blood test reading. Thanks mainly to the widespread acceptance of PSA testing starting in 1992, overall deaths from PC have dropped 44%. We would be very interested in your outcome, PC or not. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "I think a key word here is \"trending\". If you see an upward trend, you do have a cause for concern. But your numbers are SO low that, as the others have pointed out, you are certainly in no imminent danger. I would be comfortable with waiting another year for your next PSA and, if you don't have that much patience, try every six months. Some sources recommend not even blinking at any PSA reading below 0.1, but I found it helpful (please see history below) watching the micro numbers climb so I could be prepared to take action when it was warranted. Officially, salvage radiation is recommended to be considered AFTER you receive PSA readings above 0.2 on two consecutive tests. Since my \"trend\" was distinctive, I signed up for SR after my PSA reached 0.11. But everyone is different. What's right for me is not necessarily the correct decision for anyone else.",

I see that you have already undergone salvage radiotherapy -- as have I -- but for others who are experiencing a chemical recurrence following a prostatectomy, isn't there a danger that masking an actual PSA reading will provide a false sense of complacency while the cancer possibly continues to spread unabated? I ask these questions, not because I have a finite answer -- I don't, but because I don't know whether delaying SR would be productive for a patient under this scenario.

Although I know it is painful for you to imagine, is it possible that your Dad could have been shielding you from a diagnosis of a more aggressive form of prostate cancer? For example, if he had any Cat scans or full body bone scans following his initial diagnosis in 2008, they may have divulged metastasis to other areas of his body. You could start there to investigate if you are so inclined. Again, we are not doctors and at this point can only speculate. I, too, am very sorry for your loss.",

If you have surgery and the cancer returns, you can then turn to radiation to finish it off.

But the issue of proposing radiation due to positive margins in the bladder neck in the absence of an increase in PSA is a head-scratcher. I know that the Mayo Clinic is considered to be top-of-the-line, however I would be inclined to get a non-Mayo second opinion before commencing with radiation.",

      "Content": "Hi loves: You're right to be concerned about Gleason 9 which is advanced cancer but I'm not telling you anything that you're not already aware of. If it was wholly encapsulted in the prostate, then you can breathe easier but still must be watchful in the future. If you haven't already received it, I strongly suggest you obtain a copy of the surgical report and study it carefully. Then, if you have any questions, you can ask the doctor at the next appointment. Immediately after surgery, my doctor said he felt they got it all but in actuality they didn't (see signature below). I wasn't smart enough to ask for a copy of the surgical report which stated that the margins weren't clear. Lesson learned. Best of luck to you both. Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind I also feel Jim's post is way out of line....We are not here to pass judgement on people especially when the criticism reaches the point of ridicule. Jim, that was uncalled for.... Fairwind: I understand your position. My objective was not to ridicule but rather to bring attention to the OP's history and his total disregard for flashing red lights AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, how that impacts upon first-time visitors to this website. For example, anyone with a family history of PC, who ignores clear-cut warning signs (PSA of 10 for 5-6 years without follow-up) needs to have his case held up to the light as something that NEWBIES SHOULD NOT VIEW AS THE NORM. If it wasn't for unfiltered comments like mine \"calling out\" the OP for dereliction to saving his own life -- which, of course, is his right, any newbie reading his history could easily view it as acceptable conduct. Of all people, I don't need to remind you of the 30,000 PC deaths every year. A first-time viewer on this site could interpret haha's actions as being similar to his own and simply log off, thinking he's doing just fine, at least as well as haha. If not for fat mouth geezers like me, how else would he know? Being politically correct is not always correct. Jim",

      "Content": "From Wikipedia: \"Finasteride, sold under the brand names Proscar and Propecia among others, is a medication used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate).\" As a non-medical professional, this is probably a dumb question, but your use of Finasteride is somewhat puzzling to me. If the primary application of Finasteride is for treatment of an enlarged prostate, why would you use it in the absence of a prostate? Combined with the addition of Pomi-T, you may successfully have MASKED the neon red blinking warning signs of increasing PSA numbers that \u201ccould\u201d lead to life-saving salvage radiation. Congratulations -- NOT. The manipulated reduction in your PSA number post-surgery is counter-productive. Reducing the PSA number has no effect on the actual spread of prostate cancer. If you do reach the point of experiencing pain (hopefully this will not be the case), it may be from cancer metastasizing to the bones. And that's not a good thing.",

Bingo -- for me there was a recurrence and I was able to use the salvage radiation three years post-surgery to clean up some remaining cells. If I had to do it all over again, I would change nothing. Be sure to factor in your age. My uro was in a group of 9 uros who, with rare exception, adhered to the following mantra: Under age 60 - surgery Between ages 60 & 70 - patient chooses between surgery and radiation Over age 70 - radiation At age 68, I decided that I wanted what the young guys were having. Now, at age 74, I am still (part-time) on the World Poker Tour. They even use me in a nationally broadcast television commercial. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Welcome Samie: In closely reading your post, I note that \"open radical surgery\" was offered, but there is no mention of the operation that is most frequently utilized today, which is DaVinci robotic prostate cancer surgery. Is that because your local hospital does not offer DaVinci? Normally, I am in lock step with my forum brother, lancepeace, but with a PSA of 39, I would be inclined to act fairly quickly in order to prevent the cancer from continuing to spread. And, as Michael has pointed out, surgery is sometimes supplemented by radiation if the cancer returns or if there is reason to believe that surgery was not successful in removing the prostate with the cancer wholly encapsulated. Your post talks about \"surgery followed by probable radiation\" which is somewhat unusual, unless the doctor believes that the cancer has already escaped the prostate gland. And, your husband talks about \"downsides\" to surgery, but seems to ignore the fact that the majority of patients, after performing their due diligence and weighing the risks -- and downsides -- of all forms of treatment, select surgery more often than any other corrective methodology. However, only he and you can make the determination as to what is right for him. As noted, Dr. Walsh's book is a great first step (we receive no royalties -- not trying to sell you anything). Best of luck, Jim",

Although I know it is painful for you to imagine, is it possible that your Dad could have been shielding you from a diagnosis of a more aggressive form of prostate cancer? For example, if he had any Cat scans or full body bone scans following his initial diagnosis in 2008, they may have divulged metastasis to other areas of his body. You could start there to investigate if you are so inclined. Again, we are not doctors and at this point can only speculate. I, too, am very sorry for your loss.",

      "Content": "Hi Maverick: Congrats. I hope as you read this that nothing has changed. Like an old Chevy with parts wearing out, I have had to have surgery to remove kidney stones twice (2008 & 2014). Both times, they had to insert a long stent in the left ureter for about 7 days following surgery to prevent collapse. Both times, I had trouble with the stent. The last time, with the stent inserted on the 5th day after surgery, I could not pee. Not a drop. It happened at midnight. I called the on-call urologist and he said to stop by the office in the morning. For the next 8 hours, I drank nothing but understood that the body produces urine nevertheless. I don't scare easily but I had visions of my bladder filling up and bursting. At 8AM, they removed the stent early -- problem solved -- and I breathed a large sigh of relief. Crazy stuff happens when you get old. I keep looking up in case a grand piano is about to fall on my head. Jim",

If it was wholly encapsulted in the prostate, then you can breathe easier but still must be watchful in the future. If you haven't already received it, I strongly suggest you obtain a copy of the surgical report and study it carefully. Then, if you have any questions, you can ask the doctor at the next appointment. Immediately after surgery, my doctor said he felt they got it all but in actuality they didn't (see signature below). I wasn't smart enough to ask for a copy of the surgical report which stated that the margins weren't clear. Lesson learned. Best of luck to you both. Jim",

With DaVinci, 8 days at home with the catheter was an annoyance but I had zero pain overall, although very uncomfortable for the first 24 hours following surgery. Never even needed an aspirin after 24 hours. When I compare my experience to a co-worker who had open surgery and literally suffered significant pain over two months, then for me it's a no-brainer.

If it was wholly encapsulted in the prostate, then you can breathe easier but still must be watchful in the future. If you haven't already received it, I strongly suggest you obtain a copy of the surgical report and study it carefully. Then, if you have any questions, you can ask the doctor at the next appointment. Immediately after surgery, my doctor said he felt they got it all but in actuality they didn't (see signature below). I wasn't smart enough to ask for a copy of the surgical report which stated that the margins weren't clear. Lesson learned. Best of luck to you both. Jim",

I could not raise my right arm above my belt line. My orthopedic doctor scheduled me for the OR under general anesthesia. I asked how big the scar would be. He said that built-up cartilage had to be broken up, however there would be no need for a scalpel. Basically, they put me under the gas and then about 5 or 6 guys all pulled on my arm at once breaking apart the strictures. It worked great. There is probably a name for what they did but I don't have any idea what it is.",

      "Content": "Welcome John: Although I'm from PA, your City by the Bay is my favorite, having visited 20 years in a row. My great-grandfather was one of the founders of a Utopian-type town just north of you in 1890. You've probably heard of it -- it's called Mill Valley. Anyway, others who are more qualified will be able to fill in the answers to many of your questions. As you have already discovered, surgery and radiation are the two primary forms of prostate cancer treatment. Each is considered to be about equally successful with side effects popping up at different times. Brachytherapy has worked well for some of our forum brothers but be advised it is considered to be outside of the mainstream as it is the choice of only 2% of PC patients. If you are comfortable being a two-percenter, then you should be fine. I note you used the phrase \"cured of prostate cancer\" more than once.

If it was wholly encapsulted in the prostate, then you can breathe easier but still must be watchful in the future. If you haven't already received it, I strongly suggest you obtain a copy of the surgical report and study it carefully. Then, if you have any questions, you can ask the doctor at the next appointment. Immediately after surgery, my doctor said he felt they got it all but in actuality they didn't (see signature below). I wasn't smart enough to ask for a copy of the surgical report which stated that the margins weren't clear. Lesson learned. Best of luck to you both. Jim",

As noted in the past, my knowledge of a PSA \"creeping\" up helped me to mentally deal with the need for salvage radiation when it came time to be zapped. As an old guy, I lean toward using analogies -- try this one: You live in Florida. You have a small inflatable pool in the back yard filled with 12 inches of water. Your 18-month-old grandchild is playing and splashing in the pool. You walk back into the house for just a few seconds. As you do, an alligator leaves a nearby swamp and heads for the pool. Question: Do you want to be alerted when the alligator is 100 yards away from the pool or just 2 yards away? Would you NOT want to know when it's 100 yards away because it may cause you \"anxiety\"?

After someone has gone through treatment -- surgery or, in your case, radiation -- the cost of PSA tests is so inconsequential and so far down the worry scale, it's hardly worth thinking about.

      "Content": "Hi loves: You're right to be concerned about Gleason 9 which is advanced cancer but I'm not telling you anything that you're not already aware of. If it was wholly encapsulted in the prostate, then you can breathe easier but still must be watchful in the future. If you haven't already received it, I strongly suggest you obtain a copy of the surgical report and study it carefully. Then, if you have any questions, you can ask the doctor at the next appointment. Immediately after surgery, my doctor said he felt they got it all but in actuality they didn't (see signature below). I wasn't smart enough to ask for a copy of the surgical report which stated that the margins weren't clear. Lesson learned. Best of luck to you both. Jim",

As you can see from my signature, that was my choice. However, as you go forward with your research, my history contains vital criteria. If you have surgery and the cancer returns, you can then turn to radiation to finish it off. If you choose radiation as your primary treatment and the cancer returns, surgery is not possible (except in extremely rare cases). That's what sold me on the surgery -- and lucky it did.",

      "Content": "Hi mcnova: Welcome to the forum. Sorry you and your father have a need to be here. I can identify with his situation as I was also age 67 (see signature history below) when diagnosed with PC and my PSA level was similar. There are a number of suggestions that you will receive from those who come after me (surgery, radiation, etc.) on this site so I will speak only of the question you asked about waiting for higher scores before initiating treatment. My opinion: Don't. While surgery remains an option now, in a relatively short time, it may be one of the options taken off of the table as he reaches age 70. At that point, radiation may be the only hope for a \"cure\". And, to compound the dilemma, if he has surgery and the cancer returns (as mine did), he can then have salvage radiotherapy to eradicate the remaining cancer. On the other hand, if he selects radiation, he cannot (except in very rare instances) have surgery next because the prostate is deformed during radiation in such a way as to not permit surgery. Another issue is the Gleason 6 diagnosis; treatment now is almost always 100% successful as you read in Dr. Walsh's book. But a higher Gleason score may be indicative of a less successful outcome as it will possibly reveal a more aggressive strain of PC and/or show that the cancer has already spread to surrounding lymph nodes and, potentially, other organs. Right or wrong, I have never been a proponent of active surveillance. Nothing good can ever happen as the cancer isn't magically going to go away. Best of luck and I hope you find the info you seek and convince your Dad that action is indeed warranted at this point. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi David: I strongly agree with Ron. Unless you have a reason to believe that your biopsy was flawed in some way (unlikely), there appears to be no need for a second biopsy. You have extensive cancer within the prostate, albeit of the lower-risk G6 variety. And keep in mind that if you choose surgery, that G6 could possibly be upgraded to a higher number upon surgical pathological examination of the excised prostate. Surgery or radiation appears to be the logical treatment choices -- both have nearly identical successful outcomes, on average.. However, if you have a recurrence following surgery as your primary treatment, you can always revert to salvage radiation to \"clean up\" anything remaining. If you select radiation as your primary treatment, surgery is no longer an option. It was that \"second bite at the apple\" that helped to make my decision for me and, lucky that I did, because I needed salvage radiation 3 years after DaVinci surgery. What worked well for me, though, is not for everyone. Only you can decide what is the best path for yourself. Best of luck, Jim",

My objective was not to ridicule but rather to bring attention to the OP's history and his total disregard for flashing red lights AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, how that impacts upon first-time visitors to this website. For example, anyone with a family history of PC, who ignores clear-cut warning signs (PSA of 10 for 5-6 years without follow-up) needs to have his case held up to the light as something that NEWBIES SHOULD NOT VIEW AS THE NORM. If it wasn't for unfiltered comments like mine \"calling out\" the OP for dereliction to saving his own life -- which, of course, is his right, any newbie reading his history could easily view it as acceptable conduct. Of all people, I don't need to remind you of the 30,000 PC deaths every year. A first-time viewer on this site could interpret haha's actions as being similar to his own and simply log off, thinking he's doing just fine, at least as well as haha. If not for fat mouth geezers like me, how else would he know? Being politically correct is not always correct. Jim",

      "Content": "Fairwind: In PA, Medicare Advantage plans carry ridiculously high premiums (the Philadelphia Inquirer profiled a Medicare Advantage couple whose monthly premium increased by 47% in one year), and deductibles and co-pays are so high (ie., $45 co-pay to see a GP, $65 to see a specialist) that having Medicare Advantage is almost like having no insurance at all. That's the reason why only 13% of Medicare recipients in PA select Advantage. Anytime that 87% of a group of people pick the original Medicare as their coverage, there is a reason for it. Most then buy a Medigap policy to pay for the Part A deductible and the remaining 20% of charges left unpaid under Medicare Part B plus the $147 annual Part B deductible (under Medigap Plans C, D and F). In the seven years I have had original Medicare and a Medigap Plan F policy, I have never had to fill out a single form or pay a penny for a deductible or co-pay, including a bill for $240,000 sent to Medicare for 40 sessions of salvage radiotherapy following a prostatectomy.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by GunsmokeFan Jim215: thank you for your reply. How would we find out what percentage of patients choose this? or any treatment? And do you know how we could find statistics of rates of side affects (other than maybe what the doctor who does the focal cryotherapy may say)? Hi GF: Sorry for the delay in responding. It appeared to me from your husband's profile with multiple listings of PSA tests and an absence of primary treatment that your inquiry related to considering cryotherapy as primary treatment. Of course, Pratoman had the good sense to ask whether it was primary or secondary. Since my guess without research was that only about 2% of prostate cancer patients elect to have cryotherapy, I did a Google search. And I found that among all PC patients (primary and secondary), cryotherapy is selected by......2% of the men. It is described on many health care sites as being\"...a viable alternative among a paucity of choices for patients who experience a biochemical recurrence after failed primary radiation treatment.\" As far as specific side effects, I wish I could provide some info but I do not have the resources to do so with any level of confidence. My first reaction was to being uncomfortable with the recommendations of \"celebrity\" doctors, like Dr. Katz and Dr. Oz on television who sometimes cloud an issue that may be quite straightforward. For example, Dr. Katz has stated that \"over 80%\" of prostate cancer patients do NOT need surgery or radiation as their primary treatment and he seems to have his own objectives by creating active surveillance foundations and selling books. Yes, there can be unwanted, sometimes quite serious, side effects from surgery or radiation, but PC kills 30,000 men every year and any attempt to guide patients away from primary treatment -- without examining the patient in person -- just rubs me the wrong way.",

      "Content": "Hi Izicc: Welcome to the forum. You will find a fine group of caring people here who will readily share their personal experiences and provide information to the best of their ability. There are no conflicts of interest because no one is trying to sell you anything. At the same time, you may find posters who are in favor of a particular type of treatment, more so than an alternative, and that's OK because it worked for them. My only comments are: The nurse is correct that once the prostate is removed, the cancerous gland is gone but it's still very important to watch your PSA results post-surgery as the cancer can return (as shown in my history/signature below). One of the major benefits of having surgery instead of radiation (there's my bias kicking in) is that you can have salvage radiation after surgery but not surgery after radiation -- except in very rare cases. And it is also possible that your preliminary Gleason 6 could actually be pathologically upgraded to Gleason 7 post-surgery. Your doctor will be able to tell you his protocol for removal of lymph nodes (some docs take more than others). Best of luck to you and please keep us updated with your decisions/treatment/outcome which may be helpful to others. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Fred: Well, your PSA is certainly nothing to be concerned about, but if two doctors have confirmed that there is an irregularity with respect to a hard nodule on your prostate, then it certainly seems prudent to investigate. A prostate biopsy is nothing more than a diagnostic tool that takes a very small sample of your prostate and sends it to the lab. A biopsy is the only test that can detect and confirm the presence of cancer in the prostate, which would be unusual at age 43 but not unheard of. Like most diagnostic tests, it is performed to rule out, not rule in, a particular disease. You could elect to do active surveillance (AS) and have the area re-checked in 3 to 6 months. Most prostate cancers are slow-growing and, therefore, a delay may be reasonable. However, there are also less frequent strains of prostate cancer that are fast-moving and can actually kill you rather quickly. So, if you delay, you are accepting somewhat of a risk. I would view your description of a biopsy as \"overwhelming\" to be somewhat overstated. The test is frequently performed in the doctor's office and takes about ten minutes to complete. There is rarely pain involved, but the procedure is uncomfortable and you may be sore for 24-48 hours. The test is not life-threatening. Others will follow with additional info. Please let us know how you make out. Good luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi gsteve: Glad to hear your PSA is still at zero. In many cases, \"zero\" is defined as any reading below 0.1 which is officially considered to be \"undetectable\", but may actually be detectable if you go to the second decimal. So, if you view my history at the end of my two years after DaVinci, I too was in the \"undetectable\" category at the same time that the cancer was once again beginning to rear its ugly head. Your last sentence is exactly what I would suggest. However, at the end of the 2nd year after DaVinci with no evidence of a recurrence, many uros recommend a PSA test only once a year. My feeling -- regardless of \"medical protocol\" -- especially with my history, is that I will never be comfortable waiting longer than every six months between PSA tests. Good luck, Jim",

You will find a fine group of caring people here who will readily share their personal experiences and provide information to the best of their ability. There are no conflicts of interest because no one is trying to sell you anything. At the same time, you may find posters who are in favor of a particular type of treatment, more so than an alternative, and that's OK because it worked for them. My only comments are: The nurse is correct that once the prostate is removed, the cancerous gland is gone but it's still very important to watch your PSA results post-surgery as the cancer can return (as shown in my history/signature below). One of the major benefits of having surgery instead of radiation (there's my bias kicking in) is that you can have salvage radiation after surgery but not surgery after radiation -- except in very rare cases. And it is also possible that your preliminary Gleason 6 could actually be pathologically upgraded to Gleason 7 post-surgery. Your doctor will be able to tell you his protocol for removal of lymph nodes (some docs take more than others). Best of luck to you and please keep us updated with your decisions/treatment/outcome which may be helpful to others. Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Nick P MichiganMan Why am I waiting? I'm following the advice I'm given. My Surgeon is the Professor of Urology and my Oncologist is the Professor of Medicine and Surgery, both at the University of Arizona Cancer Center. I figured I was in good hands. I've put in a call to see if I can accelerate this treatment schedule after the comments I've received here. Nick Welcome Nick: Your stats -- age 68 and G7 (3+4, for me) at the time of surgery -- are identical to mine. Was G7 your final post-surgery pathology result, also? The comments from Michael and MM16 are highly knowledgeable but somewhat subdued compared to what you will hear from me. Picture this: bright flashing neon red lights, loud bells gonging, sirens blasting...... Now, take a look at my history that shows my salvage radiation treatment (no HT - never mentioned) BEGAN at 0.11. If your decimal places are correct on your PSA tests, as noted by Michael, your current status of PSA 1.0 without follow-up treatment is TEN TIMES WORSE than when I commenced salvage radiation. My 40 sessions of SR resulted in NO side effects with the exception of some mild fatigue toward the end. Six years after surgery and 3 years after SR, my PSA remains at 0.00. I can only conclude that there must be some other medical reasoning for not addressing your status with some ACTION. Or the acclaimed doctor you listed may be suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. Thanks to his non-action, you MAY now be past the point of cure (as mentioned) but rather are simply looking for an extension of life treatment. And, based upon your rising PSA numbers, if you don't act QUICKLY you may not get that opportunity. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Izicc: Welcome to the forum. You will find a fine group of caring people here who will readily share their personal experiences and provide information to the best of their ability. There are no conflicts of interest because no one is trying to sell you anything. At the same time, you may find posters who are in favor of a particular type of treatment, more so than an alternative, and that's OK because it worked for them. My only comments are: The nurse is correct that once the prostate is removed, the cancerous gland is gone but it's still very important to watch your PSA results post-surgery as the cancer can return (as shown in my history/signature below). One of the major benefits of having surgery instead of radiation (there's my bias kicking in) is that you can have salvage radiation after surgery but not surgery after radiation -- except in very rare cases. And it is also possible that your preliminary Gleason 6 could actually be pathologically upgraded to Gleason 7 post-surgery. Your doctor will be able to tell you his protocol for removal of lymph nodes (some docs take more than others). Best of luck to you and please keep us updated with your decisions/treatment/outcome which may be helpful to others. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Fred: Well, your PSA is certainly nothing to be concerned about, but if two doctors have confirmed that there is an irregularity with respect to a hard nodule on your prostate, then it certainly seems prudent to investigate. A prostate biopsy is nothing more than a diagnostic tool that takes a very small sample of your prostate and sends it to the lab. A biopsy is the only test that can detect and confirm the presence of cancer in the prostate, which would be unusual at age 43 but not unheard of. Like most diagnostic tests, it is performed to rule out, not rule in, a particular disease. You could elect to do active surveillance (AS) and have the area re-checked in 3 to 6 months. Most prostate cancers are slow-growing and, therefore, a delay may be reasonable. However, there are also less frequent strains of prostate cancer that are fast-moving and can actually kill you rather quickly. So, if you delay, you are accepting somewhat of a risk. I would view your description of a biopsy as \"overwhelming\" to be somewhat overstated. The test is frequently performed in the doctor's office and takes about ten minutes to complete. There is rarely pain involved, but the procedure is uncomfortable and you may be sore for 24-48 hours. The test is not life-threatening. Others will follow with additional info. Please let us know how you make out. Good luck. Jim",

Instead of worrying whether something bad is going on with a constantly rising PSA -- \"What should I do?

      "Content": "Welcome Rob: Michael F and Chuck have done such a good job covering the subject, my only input is agreement that if you want to get the most accurate biopsy, currently the 3T MRI offers the best chance of not missing anything. Your concerns are similar to literally thousands of guys who visit this site. There is absolutely no reason to be terrified of anything. I know it's easy for me to say but you're looking at a diagnostic TEST only, for now. And, even under a worst case scenario, prostate cancer is nearly always curable when found early and treated. But don't put the cart before the horse (you'll hear a lot of silly old clichés here). Just take it one step at a time. We'll be here. Again, no one on this site is a medical professional but we've all been there - done that and we've been of help to a lot of people. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi jphil: As Southsider said, a full-body bone scan is routine and intended to rule out metastasis to other areas of the body. It's not impossible but it is unlikely in your husband's case with Gleason 6 & 7s. And a 3+4=7 Gleason score is better than a 4+3=7 score. The former is what both your husband and I presented. My urologist said that I shouldn't feel special because a 3+4=7 Gleason is just the run-of-the-mill type of cancer seen every day in his office. Not a big deal. Treat it and move on just like it never happened. Of course, you will want to arm yourself with enough info to proceed. Our moderator, Chuck, should be along shortly to fill in the basics. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "\"I just pray that the results won't be cancer.\" Worst case scenario: it's prostate cancer. Best news possible: if you're going to have cancer, this is the one you want. Caught early, it is almost always 100% curable. Other cancers on this forum web site have a five-year survival rate as low as 6%. So, while some people may focus on the dreaded term \"cancer\" and the fear factor is naturally elevated, mortality issues rarely play a part in our prostate cancer thread. Instead, some guys exercise, while the rest of us play poker, drink beer and talk about all of the women who try to rip our clothes off. I join the others in stating that I've never heard of any side effects following a biopsy. Good luck with your biopsy today. Jim",

I was confused by your history but then realized you entered the wrong year for your biopsy, placing the biopsy AFTER your surgery. Good luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi gsteve: Glad to hear your PSA is still at zero. In many cases, \"zero\" is defined as any reading below 0.1 which is officially considered to be \"undetectable\", but may actually be detectable if you go to the second decimal. So, if you view my history at the end of my two years after DaVinci, I too was in the \"undetectable\" category at the same time that the cancer was once again beginning to rear its ugly head. Your last sentence is exactly what I would suggest. However, at the end of the 2nd year after DaVinci with no evidence of a recurrence, many uros recommend a PSA test only once a year. My feeling -- regardless of \"medical protocol\" -- especially with my history, is that I will never be comfortable waiting longer than every six months between PSA tests. Good luck, Jim",

Your concerns are similar to literally thousands of guys who visit this site. There is absolutely no reason to be terrified of anything. I know it's easy for me to say but you're looking at a diagnostic TEST only, for now. And, even under a worst case scenario, prostate cancer is nearly always curable when found early and treated. But don't put the cart before the horse (you'll hear a lot of silly old clichés here). Just take it one step at a time. We'll be here. Again, no one on this site is a medical professional but we've all been there - done that and we've been of help to a lot of people. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Ron: Prior to my DaVinci surgery, I never had a catheter before -- didn't know how they worked -- didn't care as long as I didn't have one. There is no need to freak out because it's really a non-issue. Just like folks carry a smart phone everywhere today, the catheter goes everywhere with you. I experienced zero pain and zero discomfort with it but it was a nuisance, on the level that a barking dog next dog is a nuisance. When it's time to remove it (and you will be counting down the days), you just take a deep breath, blow out and the physician or nurse will painlessly slip it out. REALLY, not a big deal. A moderate annoyance, at best. I found that sleeping in a large recliner with the catheter bag on the floor (or in a bucket) to be superior to trying to sleep in bed and worrying that tossing and turning might somehow dislodge the catheter. Some patients actually try to function normally as if they didn't have the catheter by switching to the smaller leg bag retainer and going out to public places. I suppose that's where I fall into the wimp category because I was not nearly so courageous, electing instead to stay home until it was time for the catheter to be removed. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome John: Although I'm from PA, your City by the Bay is my favorite, having visited 20 years in a row. My great-grandfather was one of the founders of a Utopian-type town just north of you in 1890. You've probably heard of it -- it's called Mill Valley. Anyway, others who are more qualified will be able to fill in the answers to many of your questions. As you have already discovered, surgery and radiation are the two primary forms of prostate cancer treatment. Each is considered to be about equally successful with side effects popping up at different times. Brachytherapy has worked well for some of our forum brothers but be advised it is considered to be outside of the mainstream as it is the choice of only 2% of PC patients. If you are comfortable being a two-percenter, then you should be fine. I note you used the phrase \"cured of prostate cancer\" more than once. Having dealt with it twice (How the hell can you get prostate cancer three years after your prostate has been removed?), I am of the personal opinion that you can never be confident that you are ever \"cured\", just like an alcoholic is an alcoholic for their entire lives, regardless of their sobriety. I view cancer in general as being equivalent to the \"Whack a Mole\" carnival game. If you knock it down in one place, it has a tendency to pop up somewhere else. John Wayne famously announced that he had beaten the Big C when he was operated on for lung cancer. A few years later, he died of stomach cancer. But maybe I'm just a pessimist. Finally, it is presumptuous to note in your history that your PC is \"confined to the gland\". At this point in your journey, it is impossible to know that. Best of luck, Jim",

In addition to all men being pigs, they are also inherently stupid, as in you sometimes must drag a thirsty horse to a watering hole. By age 58, I had spent a lifetime avoiding a DRE. My philosophy was adamant -- that's an \"exit only\" location. Don't even think about suggesting it to me. Somehow, with different doctors retiring and doctors' practices consolidating, I wound up with a female doctor named Maria, a tiny Italian girl with a bright disposition. As I was putting on my shirt after a routine exam, she said we weren't done yet and pulled on a plastic glove. I explained my position on the subject and respectfully declined. She walked to the door and locked it. She told me that I would have to throw her to the floor before she would allow me to leave without a DRE. Then, she held her gloved hand in front of my face and said, \"Jim, look at my hand. I'm 99 pounds and my fingers are almost skeletal thin. You need to have this exam at your age. Who would you rather perform it? Me or some male doctor who is 260 pounds with fat, stubby fingers?\". Oh, Maria. Yes, I caved. It was followed shortly thereafter by a colonoscopy that I had deathly feared (which wound up being so easy it was unbelievable - go to sleep, wake up to a cold orange juice). And a decade later, the PSA test that detected prostate cancer. Please advise your bf that he doesn't have a monopoly on stupidity, but there may be hope yet. Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome John: Although I'm from PA, your City by the Bay is my favorite, having visited 20 years in a row. My great-grandfather was one of the founders of a Utopian-type town just north of you in 1890. You've probably heard of it -- it's called Mill Valley. Anyway, others who are more qualified will be able to fill in the answers to many of your questions. As you have already discovered, surgery and radiation are the two primary forms of prostate cancer treatment. Each is considered to be about equally successful with side effects popping up at different times. Brachytherapy has worked well for some of our forum brothers but be advised it is considered to be outside of the mainstream as it is the choice of only 2% of PC patients. If you are comfortable being a two-percenter, then you should be fine. I note you used the phrase \"cured of prostate cancer\" more than once. Having dealt with it twice (How the hell can you get prostate cancer three years after your prostate has been removed?), I am of the personal opinion that you can never be confident that you are ever \"cured\", just like an alcoholic is an alcoholic for their entire lives, regardless of their sobriety. I view cancer in general as being equivalent to the \"Whack a Mole\" carnival game. If you knock it down in one place, it has a tendency to pop up somewhere else. John Wayne famously announced that he had beaten the Big C when he was operated on for lung cancer. A few years later, he died of stomach cancer. But maybe I'm just a pessimist. Finally, it is presumptuous to note in your history that your PC is \"confined to the gland\". At this point in your journey, it is impossible to know that. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "\"I just pray that the results won't be cancer.\" Worst case scenario: it's prostate cancer. Best news possible: if you're going to have cancer, this is the one you want. Caught early, it is almost always 100% curable. Other cancers on this forum web site have a five-year survival rate as low as 6%. So, while some people may focus on the dreaded term \"cancer\" and the fear factor is naturally elevated, mortality issues rarely play a part in our prostate cancer thread. Instead, some guys exercise, while the rest of us play poker, drink beer and talk about all of the women who try to rip our clothes off.

      "Content": "Hi Izicc: Welcome to the forum. You will find a fine group of caring people here who will readily share their personal experiences and provide information to the best of their ability. There are no conflicts of interest because no one is trying to sell you anything. At the same time, you may find posters who are in favor of a particular type of treatment, more so than an alternative, and that's OK because it worked for them. My only comments are: The nurse is correct that once the prostate is removed, the cancerous gland is gone but it's still very important to watch your PSA results post-surgery as the cancer can return (as shown in my history/signature below). One of the major benefits of having surgery instead of radiation (there's my bias kicking in) is that you can have salvage radiation after surgery but not surgery after radiation -- except in very rare cases. And it is also possible that your preliminary Gleason 6 could actually be pathologically upgraded to Gleason 7 post-surgery. Your doctor will be able to tell you his protocol for removal of lymph nodes (some docs take more than others). Best of luck to you and please keep us updated with your decisions/treatment/outcome which may be helpful to others. Jim",

      "Content": "With all due respect, as usual, I probably fall into the category of Devil's Advocate. The discussion seems centered on testing, testing, testing. My take is this: why the hell is ANYONE talking about testing when -- as Chuck pointed out -- the patient has ALREADY been CONFIRMED to have prostate cancer. Instead of worrying whether something bad is going on with a constantly rising PSA -- \"What should I do? What should I do?\", to me, the answer is rudimentary: get it the hell out of there and let post-surgery pathology figure out what's actually in there. If I was the patient, with two brothers with PC, I would be shopping this morning at Wal-Mart for a robe and slippers for my overnight hospital stay following surgery. But I guess I'm just a crazy old man.",

      "Content": "\".. because my BF becomes irritable when I push him or question him about things.\" Welcome: Relax. Your bf is not alone. In addition to all men being pigs, they are also inherently stupid, as in you sometimes must drag a thirsty horse to a watering hole. By age 58, I had spent a lifetime avoiding a DRE. My philosophy was adamant -- that's an \"exit only\" location. Don't even think about suggesting it to me. Somehow, with different doctors retiring and doctors' practices consolidating, I wound up with a female doctor named Maria, a tiny Italian girl with a bright disposition. As I was putting on my shirt after a routine exam, she said we weren't done yet and pulled on a plastic glove. I explained my position on the subject and respectfully declined. She walked to the door and locked it. She told me that I would have to throw her to the floor before she would allow me to leave without a DRE. Then, she held her gloved hand in front of my face and said, \"Jim, look at my hand. I'm 99 pounds and my fingers are almost skeletal thin. You need to have this exam at your age. Who would you rather perform it? Me or some male doctor who is 260 pounds with fat, stubby fingers?\". Oh, Maria. Yes, I caved. It was followed shortly thereafter by a colonoscopy that I had deathly feared (which wound up being so easy it was unbelievable - go to sleep, wake up to a cold orange juice). And a decade later, the PSA test that detected prostate cancer. Please advise your bf that he doesn't have a monopoly on stupidity, but there may be hope yet. Jim",

Maybe Chuck could provide some info on that subject. I understand what you mean by \"how radiation works\" but in the primary treatment, I suspect it is aimed at a particular tumor(s) while in the SR treatments it likely casts a kind of \"spray\" over the prostate bed area where the prostate once resided.

      "Content": "Hi Izicc: Welcome to the forum. You will find a fine group of caring people here who will readily share their personal experiences and provide information to the best of their ability. There are no conflicts of interest because no one is trying to sell you anything. At the same time, you may find posters who are in favor of a particular type of treatment, more so than an alternative, and that's OK because it worked for them. My only comments are: The nurse is correct that once the prostate is removed, the cancerous gland is gone but it's still very important to watch your PSA results post-surgery as the cancer can return (as shown in my history/signature below). One of the major benefits of having surgery instead of radiation (there's my bias kicking in) is that you can have salvage radiation after surgery but not surgery after radiation -- except in very rare cases. And it is also possible that your preliminary Gleason 6 could actually be pathologically upgraded to Gleason 7 post-surgery. Your doctor will be able to tell you his protocol for removal of lymph nodes (some docs take more than others). Best of luck to you and please keep us updated with your decisions/treatment/outcome which may be helpful to others. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Southsider: So, of your 3 biopsies, you had one core with G6 followed by no malignant cores followed by 3 cores with G6. My comment is that if you have another biopsy, you would do well to have a 3T MRI in advance to try to pinpoint areas of suspicion. As far as your \"low risk\" rating, I never had a lot of confidence in tests that only speculate and fail to provide finite information (like an X-ray showing a broken arm is finite). In Vegas, if you want to bet on the Kentucky Derby, you have a \"low risk\" of picking the winner. Does that help? Probably not much. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi DTrom: My path has been somewhat similar to yours. Although there is a small chance of error, please investigate the following: On your last PSA reading of 0.05, was that provided to you on a written lab report or verbally by a doctor's support staff member? While all of my doctors have been top notch, I have come across some support staff who served as WalMart greeters the week before. With that in mind, a number of labs report PSA findings as <0.05, which could actually translate to 0.00. If you received a verbal report, I would double-check to confirm that the \"<\" (less than) sign was not present. Good luck, Jim",

      "Content": "On the subject of prednisone, just wanted to share a story: In May, 2003, my wife suffered the second of two neurological episodes within a six-month period. At the time, they were believed to be TIAs (mini-strokes), later diagnosed as actual modest strokes. In order to find a suspected area of plaque blockage that was breaking loose, she was given a test (called a TEE, transesophogeal echocardiogram) to view the area behind the heart, near her aortic arch. We arrived back home at 2PM when she laid down to take a nap. She awoke at 6PM with horrible itching of the scalp. A night without sleep followed. By the morning, we returned to the mid-sized hospital where the TEE was given and she was diagnosed as having a reaction to either Demerol or Versed, which were administered with the TEE and she was transferred to the ER. At this point, her entire scalp and the tops of her ears and abdomen were covered in bright-red rashes. For eight hours in the ER, she was given injections of Benadryl which did absolutely nothing to relieve her condition or discomfort. The ER doctor decided to send her home. That's when I went ballistic. I loudly pointed out to the entire staff (and patients within earshot) that it was THIS HOSPITAL that caused her problem and it was THIS HOSPITAL that didn't have a f___ing clue how to resolve the issue. It came very close to having security escort me from the property. After no improvement in 72 hours, I drove my wife into the city to the Dermatology Department of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania where dozens of patients awaited their scheduled appointments with highly-skilled dermatologists -- many of whom who had waited months for their appointment. I approached an older woman at the registration desk, explained what had happened at the mid-sized hospital and literally begged her to have a dermatologist examine my wife, who hadn't had any sleep in 3 days. At first, she said it was impossible because all of the appointment slots were filled. When she saw I was starting to choke up, she asked me to take a seat. Ten minutes later, she asked if we could wait an hour for her to squeeze us in. Could we? Hell, yes, we could wait an hour. When the female Asian-American dermatologist examined my wife, she immediately left the room and returned with three of her colleagues who then each examined my wife. Next, they huddled in a corner of the room and the first doctor said it was good that we had come in when we did because the rash was starting to approach my wife's eyes and that could have been an even bigger problem. Their solution? Massive doses of injected and then oral Prednisone! I asked, \"What if that doesn't work? Do you have a Plan B?\". She looked at her colleagues, smiled and said, \"Sir, this is the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. We don't deal in Plan Bs. This WILL work\". And, within 24 hours, it did. (Sorry for the length). On our follow-up appointment three weeks later, I brought a large box of Godiva chocolate for the clerk who found compassion in her heart to allow my wife to see a specialist.",

Here's a very old silly little ditty that seems quite accurate here: \"A son is a son until he takes a wife; a daughter is a daughter for all of your life\". Our elder daughter, who works in the medical field selling heart valves, sat in with my wife and I and my lung cancer surgeon in March (Please see below). It was she who suggested a 3-month timeout before I had part of a lung cut out. The doctors reluctantly agreed. Three months later, the nodule shrank -- no cancer -- no surgery --and she was proven right. I am most grateful for her input.",

      "Content": "\"....their is no evidence of cancer besides the initial low grade score. I want to have the best information to contradict this advice for a biopsy.\" OK, maybe I'm a little dense but when is there \"no evidence of cancer\" when you are diagnosed with cancer? CANCER IS CANCER, LOW-GRADE OR NOT! Prostate cancer kills 30,000 men every year. Try asking their surviving family members if they believe it was a great idea for the deceased to avoid a second biopsy at any cost. Fairwind states the obvious much better than I possibly can, but are you seriously looking for support on this website from prostate cancer survivors to encourage you to reject a simple diagnostic -- yet uncomfortable -- test, recommended by your doctor, that could potentially save your life? C'mon, man!!",

You could write to MD Anderson to ask the administration if they stand behind Mr. Simpson's claims. Guaranteed, they won't. If you choose to investigate further, I would ask Mr. Simpson's representatives to provide you with copies of \"drug laws\" in each of the 49 states that don't permit the oil to be sold and the reasons why that is true. For example, dozens of states now permit the distribution of medical cannabis. And none cost $1,500 for a 30-day supply, which is patently ridiculous. It's a scam, Ron. Don't be a victim. Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome to the group, Robin, and sorry you find yourself here. Well, holy crap, you sure have had quite a run of doctors. There will be others who chime in shortly but I'd be willing to bet that you won't hear from many other 28-year-olds on this website who have experienced prostate cancer. Not saying it's impossible, but you have already found that it's extremely unusual. We are not medical professionals on this site, so we can only offer to share our experiences which may or may not correlate with what you are suffering from. Let's go back to the low grade fever that you experience daily -- you said it makes you feel \"dizzy\" and \"terrible\". With all of the tests that you have had, has any doctor indicated that your problem might be related to neurology, rather than urology? Have you ever had an MRI or a scan of the head? The \"dizzy\" part of the low grade fever kind of points me in that direction, rather than worry about a somewhat elevated PSA reading for your age group. Stay tuned. More will follow. Best of luck.

Could there be a recurrence, sure, but with an excellent pathology report you are likely in the 80-90% category of not having anything bad happen in the future. You're on target for reaching the Land of Dryness within the average period expected. I recognize that, because of your age, the ED is a concern; you know the numbers -- sometimes it takes up to 2 years to resolve and it's rare to return to the full potency of original equipment. Nevertheless, you have every reason to expect to live a full life-span as if you never had PC. I have friends on the lung cancer thread; it's hard for me to communicate with some of them through my tears because I know their future -- or lack of it. You saw a professional to be treated for your cancer. If you recognize that you're putting too much focus on the aftermath, then you could consider seeing a professional to deal with emotional trauma because, while the next PSA test is always troubling to most of us, you can't let it overcome you.

      "Content": "Hi Jim: If all goes well with surgery AND you take plenty of time to fully recover following surgery before returning to a strenuous job, then a year later you will look in your rear-view mirror at nothing more than a bump along life's highway. That's the scenario for most prostate cancer patients who choose surgery. Conversely, your Gleason 7 pre-surgery could possibly be upgraded post-surgery and your PC journey may not yet be over. In my case, as in about 15-20% of patients, the PC returned 3 years later but, because I had selected surgery as my primary treatment, I was able to get a second chance at a \"cure\" with salvage radiation. If you select radiation as your PRIMARY treatment, that \"second chance\" option is not available. My PC is gone for now, but honestly, no one can predict the future. I'm hopeful that I'm done with it. You've already taken Step #1 by getting Dr. Walsh's book. Only after doing extensive research can you determine what is the right path for YOU personally. But I will recommend this: Stay away from \"alternative\" medicines because they can never cure PC. Every once in a while we get a new patient who thinks he will be cured of PC by eating apricot seeds (or similar stuff). One hundred years ago, con artists tried to sell snake oil to people to \"cure\" all of their maladies. Be careful -- those snake oil salesmen still exist. You will get plenty more input here in the next few days. There are no MDs on this site -- only patients and caregivers who will gladly share their experiences in an effort to help others. And as bad as it is to get news that you have the Big \"C\", this is a cancer that you actually want, as it is virtually 100% curable when caught early and treated. Not so, with some other cancers (ie., pancreatic and lung). Best of luck, Jim",

CANCER IS CANCER, LOW-GRADE OR NOT! Prostate cancer kills 30,000 men every year. Try asking their surviving family members if they believe it was a great idea for the deceased to avoid a second biopsy at any cost. Fairwind states the obvious much better than I possibly can, but are you seriously looking for support on this website from prostate cancer survivors to encourage you to reject a simple diagnostic -- yet uncomfortable -- test, recommended by your doctor, that could potentially save your life?

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ryguy3000 Hi everyone, Looking for some support/information here. My grandfather, who is 85 years old, has been visibly healthy as long as I've known him. He still lives on his own, takes no medications, drives, etc. The past 2 weeks, he's had really bad lower back/leg pain. He also had trouble urinating. After a blood test, it was determined he had a PSA level of around 11. We're now waiting for him to get an appointment with a urologist. Nothing is confirmed, but from what we've been told, it looks like it might be prostate cancer that spread to his bones. From what I've read, this is generally stage 4 prostate cancer. What is the prognosis on this? Do people usually get better with treatment? Thanks. Whoa. Whoa. And whoa again. If you buy into an automatic worst-case scenario (Stage 4 prostate cancer?), you are doing your grandfather a great disservice. As others have noted, there can be reasonable explanations that are not accompanied by dire outcomes. Try to deal only with the reality of confirmed test results and not rampant speculation. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Hi Mattie: A quick story. The year was 1970. A co-worker went out on medical leave for 8 months and returned to the job as merely a shell of his former 220 lb. frame -- he probably weighed about 130 lbs. He looked like death warmed over. I said, \"What the hell happened to you?\". The answer: Open surgery to treat prostate cancer. I made a mental note to myself that if I ever had cancer I hoped beyond hope that I didn't contract prostate cancer. Flash forward to 2010. My diagnosis: Prostate cancer. Damn. Whatever happened, I knew I didn't want to suffer like my former co-worker did forty years earlier. I assure you that your anxiety could not possibly have exceeded my fear. After researching the subject, I learned that the newer DaVinci robotic surgery no longer required being gutted with a scalpel but rather was performed by punching several small holes in the area of the lower abdomen where the surgeon's tools are now able to remove the offending cancerous prostate gland. I never actually understood how a catheter even worked, let alone having experienced one. Bottom line in my case (everyone is different -- some patients do have post-surgery problems but I believe they are the exception): My surgery was textbook -- I took a single pain pill within 24 hours of surgery -- never a need for more; The catheter was totally pain-free although admittedly a nuisance for 8 days at home -- I celebrated the day it came out; My surgeon said his patients experience some incontinence for about 2 months while others take longer to return to normal -- I was completely dry by the 60th day. In my case, the cancer actually returned 3 years later and I dealt with it. If you read multiple prostate cancer threads on this site, you will find many patients who have aggressive forms of the disease which were found late and/or that the cancer has metastasized to the point where a \"cure\" is no longer possible. Or read other cancer threads where the 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is 6% and lung cancer is 18%. For you to thumb your nose at a potential cure while others would give anything to trade places with you, to be frank, seems short-sighted. You are not alone. Millions of men have traveled this path before you -- most with anxiety and dealing with some repellant stuff for a very short time frame -- and continued on with their lives just as if they never had prostate cancer. If they can do it, you can do it. Don't sell yourself short. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Steve: You are a very patient individual if you have suffered with BPH problems for 10-15 years without pushing for a resolution. However, IMHO while I certainly welcome new technologies like 1.5T or 3T MRIs, to \"map' for a possible future fusion biopsy, all of those efforts appear to be \"dancing around the edges\" of simply forging ahead with a biopsy. And, as you know, a biopsy is the ONLY current diagnostic test that will give you the answers you seek. And if you wait another 15 years weighing all of your options, you may \"age out\" of a possible cure if prostate cancer surgery is warranted. My guess is that if your automobile demonstrated equal faulty operations, you would have had it diagnosed and repaired by now. My suggestion is to get the biopsy now and move ahead with whatever decisions need to be made. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Steve: You are a very patient individual if you have suffered with BPH problems for 10-15 years without pushing for a resolution. However, IMHO while I certainly welcome new technologies like 1.5T or 3T MRIs, to \"map' for a possible future fusion biopsy, all of those efforts appear to be \"dancing around the edges\" of simply forging ahead with a biopsy. And, as you know, a biopsy is the ONLY current diagnostic test that will give you the answers you seek. And if you wait another 15 years weighing all of your options, you may \"age out\" of a possible cure if prostate cancer surgery is warranted. My guess is that if your automobile demonstrated equal faulty operations, you would have had it diagnosed and repaired by now. My suggestion is to get the biopsy now and move ahead with whatever decisions need to be made. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by brownie43 You stated you would be furious with the Dr. Well, it is the VA, and I forgot to mention that I am 73yrs. old. The first VA Urologist that I saw at the VA was a bit \"put off\" because I had a PSA in my labs., and said he would never order a PSA for anyone 70 or older but seeing as how someone else was ordering 'unnecessary lab work\", he would do a DRE (enlarged but no bumps). Said if I came in dragging an oxygen bottle or such, he would not order more tests, etc. but I was a youthful 73, so lucky me. Anyway, he did order up another PSA and recommended a biopsy. Not sure how to get a second opinion at the VA, so will probably go to my Medicare PCP Welcome brownie: As Pratoman noted, your high PSA score may indicate a true Gleason score higher than G6. If you Google \"average life expectancy of a male in the U.S.\", you will get 74.4 years. Since I am currently 74.5 years, I'm past my expiration date but, for whatever reason, I feel able to do most things that I could thirty years ago (including traveling the country playing televised poker semi-professionally). https://www.dropbox.com/s/2tgsaqzh4a...ience.mp4?dl=0 But the VA, with a limited budget, clearly looks at you at age 73 as money wasted on a patient with a limited life expectancy, regardless of your robust abilities. By now, you should realize that a primary care physician is fine for treating someone with a boo-boo and can apply a Band-Aid to a knee. You're past that with a cancer (albeit mild G6) confirmation. But if the VA allows you to be treated by an outside Medicare PCP, why not try for an appointment with a non-VA urologist? He/she should be able to provide a second opinion relative to the recommendations of your radiologist, who is concerned about your enlarged lymph nodes. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ryguy3000 Hi everyone, Looking for some support/information here. My grandfather, who is 85 years old, has been visibly healthy as long as I've known him. He still lives on his own, takes no medications, drives, etc. The past 2 weeks, he's had really bad lower back/leg pain. He also had trouble urinating. After a blood test, it was determined he had a PSA level of around 11. We're now waiting for him to get an appointment with a urologist. Nothing is confirmed, but from what we've been told, it looks like it might be prostate cancer that spread to his bones. From what I've read, this is generally stage 4 prostate cancer. What is the prognosis on this? Do people usually get better with treatment? Thanks. Whoa. Whoa. And whoa again. If you buy into an automatic worst-case scenario (Stage 4 prostate cancer?), you are doing your grandfather a great disservice. As others have noted, there can be reasonable explanations that are not accompanied by dire outcomes. Try to deal only with the reality of confirmed test results and not rampant speculation. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Welcome Hilander: Exploring possible odds and probabilities can be counter-productive. But you could look at it this way: Worst case scenario -- you have cancer. Best case scenario if biopsy is positive -- you have prostate cancer. Caught early and treated, it is one of only a few cancers that are nearly 100% curable. That's not something to be taken lightly as a review of some other cancers on this website will reveal. Just take it one step at a time and let us know your biopsy results. Posters on this site are not medical professionals but we (and in many cases, our care-givers) will be glad to share our experiences and offer support which you may find helpful. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Jim: If all goes well with surgery AND you take plenty of time to fully recover following surgery before returning to a strenuous job, then a year later you will look in your rear-view mirror at nothing more than a bump along life's highway. That's the scenario for most prostate cancer patients who choose surgery. Conversely, your Gleason 7 pre-surgery could possibly be upgraded post-surgery and your PC journey may not yet be over. In my case, as in about 15-20% of patients, the PC returned 3 years later but, because I had selected surgery as my primary treatment, I was able to get a second chance at a \"cure\" with salvage radiation. If you select radiation as your PRIMARY treatment, that \"second chance\" option is not available. My PC is gone for now, but honestly, no one can predict the future. I'm hopeful that I'm done with it. You've already taken Step #1 by getting Dr. Walsh's book. Only after doing extensive research can you determine what is the right path for YOU personally. But I will recommend this: Stay away from \"alternative\" medicines because they can never cure PC. Every once in a while we get a new patient who thinks he will be cured of PC by eating apricot seeds (or similar stuff). One hundred years ago, con artists tried to sell snake oil to people to \"cure\" all of their maladies. Be careful -- those snake oil salesmen still exist. You will get plenty more input here in the next few days. There are no MDs on this site -- only patients and caregivers who will gladly share their experiences in an effort to help others. And as bad as it is to get news that you have the Big \"C\", this is a cancer that you actually want, as it is virtually 100% curable when caught early and treated. Not so, with some other cancers (ie., pancreatic and lung). Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Wendy: It would be easy for a majority of my forum brothers to suggest that DaVinci should be the default modality for your husband, particularly at age 56. And his biopsy doesn't show a particularly aggressive Gleason score -- again, advantage DaVinci. But with a PSA hovering around 20 which wasn't affected by antibiotics, indicating the source of that reading was likely not due to an infection, it's possible that something problematic is the cause. With that in mind, we are all sort of peeing into the wind (please pardon the pun) until you meet with the doctor on Wednesday to discuss the results of the CT and full body bone scan and weigh his recommendations. We could speculate; however, there is nothing more valuable than finite test results. Please let us know what happens on Wednesday and, from that point moving forward, our combined experiences may serve to help guide you toward a reasonable pathway to a resolution. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind You should not be concerned at all.... Are you reading the decimal placement correctly? At a PSA of 0.1 post-surgery, many ROs would be prepping a patient for salvage radiation. Assuming the most recent PSA result was not an error, another PSA of 0.1 or higher is currently considered to be a biochemical recurrence. As soon as I hit 0.11, I scheduled 40 sessions of SR after monitoring a clear-cut upward trend. This is exactly the reason why a single decimal point while monitoring PSA makes no sense IMHO because it lulls the patient into thinking <0.1 is just fine when, if fact, it could be climbing every 3 months (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.07) and the patient remains totally in the dark. In this case, a second PSA reading of 0.1 or higher is very likely time for action. Chuck, Pratoman, Michael F, MichiganMan16, am I missing something here?",

Once that starts, I am told continence does NOT improve. So yes I am feeling a bit stressed. However, I think there have been lots of folks who have very good continence in 4 months...hopefully I will be counted among them. As for other activities - I am laying low as instructed. Steve As stated, everyone is different with respect to recovery. I think the one year period noted was to include nearly everyone. My uro said that among his post-surgery patients, the AVERAGE time to reach the Land of Total Dryness was roughly 2 months. I reached that plateau on exactly the 60th day. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Hi Jim: If all goes well with surgery AND you take plenty of time to fully recover following surgery before returning to a strenuous job, then a year later you will look in your rear-view mirror at nothing more than a bump along life's highway. That's the scenario for most prostate cancer patients who choose surgery. Conversely, your Gleason 7 pre-surgery could possibly be upgraded post-surgery and your PC journey may not yet be over. In my case, as in about 15-20% of patients, the PC returned 3 years later but, because I had selected surgery as my primary treatment, I was able to get a second chance at a \"cure\" with salvage radiation. If you select radiation as your PRIMARY treatment, that \"second chance\" option is not available. My PC is gone for now, but honestly, no one can predict the future. I'm hopeful that I'm done with it. You've already taken Step #1 by getting Dr. Walsh's book. Only after doing extensive research can you determine what is the right path for YOU personally. But I will recommend this: Stay away from \"alternative\" medicines because they can never cure PC. Every once in a while we get a new patient who thinks he will be cured of PC by eating apricot seeds (or similar stuff). One hundred years ago, con artists tried to sell snake oil to people to \"cure\" all of their maladies. Be careful -- those snake oil salesmen still exist. You will get plenty more input here in the next few days. There are no MDs on this site -- only patients and caregivers who will gladly share their experiences in an effort to help others. And as bad as it is to get news that you have the Big \"C\", this is a cancer that you actually want, as it is virtually 100% curable when caught early and treated. Not so, with some other cancers (ie., pancreatic and lung). Best of luck, Jim",

That's the scenario for most prostate cancer patients who choose surgery. Conversely, your Gleason 7 pre-surgery could possibly be upgraded post-surgery and your PC journey may not yet be over. In my case, as in about 15-20% of patients, the PC returned 3 years later but, because I had selected surgery as my primary treatment, I was able to get a second chance at a \"cure\" with salvage radiation. If you select radiation as your PRIMARY treatment, that \"second chance\" option is not available. My PC is gone for now, but honestly, no one can predict the future. I'm hopeful that I'm done with it. You've already taken Step #1 by getting Dr. Walsh's book. Only after doing extensive research can you determine what is the right path for YOU personally. But I will recommend this: Stay away from \"alternative\" medicines because they can never cure PC.

I suspect your doctor was sending you for an ultrasound to determine the size of your prostate and then would have likely taken the next step to the PSA test and a urologist referral. Many guys who come to this site for the first time have concerns that are similar to yours. However, you seem on the verge of expecting the worst when there is no evidence yet of anything that bad.

Not saying it's impossible, but you have already found that it's extremely unusual. We are not medical professionals on this site, so we can only offer to share our experiences which may or may not correlate with what you are suffering from. Let's go back to the low grade fever that you experience daily -- you said it makes you feel \"dizzy\" and \"terrible\". With all of the tests that you have had, has any doctor indicated that your problem might be related to neurology, rather than urology? Have you ever had an MRI or a scan of the head? The \"dizzy\" part of the low grade fever kind of points me in that direction, rather than worry about a somewhat elevated PSA reading for your age group. Stay tuned. More will follow. Best of luck.

      "Content": "Hi Mattie: A quick story. The year was 1970. A co-worker went out on medical leave for 8 months and returned to the job as merely a shell of his former 220 lb. frame -- he probably weighed about 130 lbs. He looked like death warmed over. I said, \"What the hell happened to you?\". The answer: Open surgery to treat prostate cancer. I made a mental note to myself that if I ever had cancer I hoped beyond hope that I didn't contract prostate cancer. Flash forward to 2010. My diagnosis: Prostate cancer. Damn. Whatever happened, I knew I didn't want to suffer like my former co-worker did forty years earlier. I assure you that your anxiety could not possibly have exceeded my fear. After researching the subject, I learned that the newer DaVinci robotic surgery no longer required being gutted with a scalpel but rather was performed by punching several small holes in the area of the lower abdomen where the surgeon's tools are now able to remove the offending cancerous prostate gland. I never actually understood how a catheter even worked, let alone having experienced one. Bottom line in my case (everyone is different -- some patients do have post-surgery problems but I believe they are the exception): My surgery was textbook -- I took a single pain pill within 24 hours of surgery -- never a need for more; The catheter was totally pain-free although admittedly a nuisance for 8 days at home -- I celebrated the day it came out; My surgeon said his patients experience some incontinence for about 2 months while others take longer to return to normal -- I was completely dry by the 60th day. In my case, the cancer actually returned 3 years later and I dealt with it. If you read multiple prostate cancer threads on this site, you will find many patients who have aggressive forms of the disease which were found late and/or that the cancer has metastasized to the point where a \"cure\" is no longer possible. Or read other cancer threads where the 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is 6% and lung cancer is 18%. For you to thumb your nose at a potential cure while others would give anything to trade places with you, to be frank, seems short-sighted. You are not alone. Millions of men have traveled this path before you -- most with anxiety and dealing with some repellant stuff for a very short time frame -- and continued on with their lives just as if they never had prostate cancer. If they can do it, you can do it. Don't sell yourself short. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "In February, a close friend was touring Ireland with a group when he took ill. His wife e-mailed us each night for the 10 days he was in a local hospital where tests were run to determine his problem (eventually diagnosed back in the States as an abdominal aortic aneurysm). Her description of the conditions in the Ireland hospital approached the unthinkable for U.S. citizens. She explained that she had to shop nearly every day to provide him with basic necessities. Patients had to supply their own soap, toothbrush and toothpaste, shaving supplies, toiletries and even their own hospital gowns. Her husband shared a room with seven other men, one of whom had been in the same hospital for more than a year because doctors still hadn't been able to successfully diagnose his problem. It sounded very much like a Third World country. Now, you say that robotic surgery, which has been available in many countries for more than a decade \"...is not an option here\". The other posters suggested changing doctors. I suggest, if possible, you change countries for his treatment. In the meanwhile, we look forward to your posting of his biopsy results (number of cores taken, number of positive cores, the percentage involvement of each positive core, etc.). A normal PSA result combined with an aggressive Gleason 9 score seems highly suspect.",

Once that starts, I am told continence does NOT improve. So yes I am feeling a bit stressed. However, I think there have been lots of folks who have very good continence in 4 months...hopefully I will be counted among them. As for other activities - I am laying low as instructed. Steve As stated, everyone is different with respect to recovery. I think the one year period noted was to include nearly everyone. My uro said that among his post-surgery patients, the AVERAGE time to reach the Land of Total Dryness was roughly 2 months. I reached that plateau on exactly the 60th day. Best of luck.",

I've found that a wealth of general knowledge can be gained by simply reading various threads under prostate cancer. Each story is a little different from the previous one. My history was a PSA of 4.95 -- 2 cores of 12 positive -- 3+4 Gleason -- had DaVinci robotic surgery in 2010 - cancer came back in 2013 -- try explaining to someone that you still have prostate cancer but you have no prostate -- 40 sessions of radiation followed -- PSA now 0.00. Yes, you do need a \"plan of action\" but accept the fact that you are not in \"imminent\" danger. Then, take a deep breath and soldier on, gathering as much info as reasonably possible.

Everything that I have read in recent years tells me that success comes more often by being proactive, rather than wait before seeking more treatment. Surely, you can see in my signature that salvage radiation has treated me fine, so far. But,, as you well know, a G7 is a whole lot different than a G9 and I make no attempt to equate the two.

      "Content": "R2F: OMG! You SHOULD sleep soundly tonight based on his performance so far post-surgery AND the favorable pathology report. Pratoman touches on one area that many patients experience angst over when they really shouldn't. Every guy has a different time frame for reaching full continence. And, over and over, we have seen instances when a patient sees more leakage one day than the preceding day and they become depressed and start feeling sorry for themselves because \"...it's not getting better, it's getting worse AND this is ONLY happening to me...\" when, in fact, it is simply normal and part of the healing process. It should not be a cause for concern. Kegels are great (don't overdo what is recommended by his doctor) but my uro explained that even if no Kegels were performed, a return to full continence will still occur -- it would just take a little longer. The other side of the coin can be too much confidence after continence returns and he just wants to move on and forget about PC altogether. It's still vitally important to continue PSA testing at whatever interval is suggested by his doctor. Congrats and best wishes, Jim",

      "Content": "In February, a close friend was touring Ireland with a group when he took ill. His wife e-mailed us each night for the 10 days he was in a local hospital where tests were run to determine his problem (eventually diagnosed back in the States as an abdominal aortic aneurysm). Her description of the conditions in the Ireland hospital approached the unthinkable for U.S. citizens. She explained that she had to shop nearly every day to provide him with basic necessities. Patients had to supply their own soap, toothbrush and toothpaste, shaving supplies, toiletries and even their own hospital gowns. Her husband shared a room with seven other men, one of whom had been in the same hospital for more than a year because doctors still hadn't been able to successfully diagnose his problem. It sounded very much like a Third World country. Now, you say that robotic surgery, which has been available in many countries for more than a decade \"...is not an option here\". The other posters suggested changing doctors. I suggest, if possible, you change countries for his treatment. In the meanwhile, we look forward to your posting of his biopsy results (number of cores taken, number of positive cores, the percentage involvement of each positive core, etc.). A normal PSA result combined with an aggressive Gleason 9 score seems highly suspect.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind You should not be concerned at all.... Are you reading the decimal placement correctly? At a PSA of 0.1 post-surgery, many ROs would be prepping a patient for salvage radiation. Assuming the most recent PSA result was not an error, another PSA of 0.1 or higher is currently considered to be a biochemical recurrence.

At a PSA of 0.1 post-surgery, many ROs would be prepping a patient for salvage radiation.

      "Content": "R2F: OMG! You SHOULD sleep soundly tonight based on his performance so far post-surgery AND the favorable pathology report. Pratoman touches on one area that many patients experience angst over when they really shouldn't. Every guy has a different time frame for reaching full continence. And, over and over, we have seen instances when a patient sees more leakage one day than the preceding day and they become depressed and start feeling sorry for themselves because \"...it's not getting better, it's getting worse AND this is ONLY happening to me...\" when, in fact, it is simply normal and part of the healing process. It should not be a cause for concern. Kegels are great (don't overdo what is recommended by his doctor) but my uro explained that even if no Kegels were performed, a return to full continence will still occur -- it would just take a little longer. The other side of the coin can be too much confidence after continence returns and he just wants to move on and forget about PC altogether. It's still vitally important to continue PSA testing at whatever interval is suggested by his doctor. Congrats and best wishes, Jim",

Many guys who come to this site for the first time have concerns that are similar to yours. However, you seem on the verge of expecting the worst when there is no evidence yet of anything that bad.

      "Content": "R2F: OMG! You SHOULD sleep soundly tonight based on his performance so far post-surgery AND the favorable pathology report. Pratoman touches on one area that many patients experience angst over when they really shouldn't. Every guy has a different time frame for reaching full continence. And, over and over, we have seen instances when a patient sees more leakage one day than the preceding day and they become depressed and start feeling sorry for themselves because \"...it's not getting better, it's getting worse AND this is ONLY happening to me...\" when, in fact, it is simply normal and part of the healing process. It should not be a cause for concern. Kegels are great (don't overdo what is recommended by his doctor) but my uro explained that even if no Kegels were performed, a return to full continence will still occur -- it would just take a little longer. The other side of the coin can be too much confidence after continence returns and he just wants to move on and forget about PC altogether. It's still vitally important to continue PSA testing at whatever interval is suggested by his doctor. Congrats and best wishes, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by brownie43 You stated you would be furious with the Dr. Well, it is the VA, and I forgot to mention that I am 73yrs. old. The first VA Urologist that I saw at the VA was a bit \"put off\" because I had a PSA in my labs., and said he would never order a PSA for anyone 70 or older but seeing as how someone else was ordering 'unnecessary lab work\", he would do a DRE (enlarged but no bumps). Said if I came in dragging an oxygen bottle or such, he would not order more tests, etc. but I was a youthful 73, so lucky me. Anyway, he did order up another PSA and recommended a biopsy. Not sure how to get a second opinion at the VA, so will probably go to my Medicare PCP Welcome brownie: As Pratoman noted, your high PSA score may indicate a true Gleason score higher than G6. If you Google \"average life expectancy of a male in the U.S.\", you will get 74.4 years. Since I am currently 74.5 years, I'm past my expiration date but, for whatever reason, I feel able to do most things that I could thirty years ago (including traveling the country playing televised poker semi-professionally). https://www.dropbox.com/s/2tgsaqzh4a...ience.mp4?dl=0 But the VA, with a limited budget, clearly looks at you at age 73 as money wasted on a patient with a limited life expectancy, regardless of your robust abilities. By now, you should realize that a primary care physician is fine for treating someone with a boo-boo and can apply a Band-Aid to a knee. You're past that with a cancer (albeit mild G6) confirmation. But if the VA allows you to be treated by an outside Medicare PCP, why not try for an appointment with a non-VA urologist? He/she should be able to provide a second opinion relative to the recommendations of your radiologist, who is concerned about your enlarged lymph nodes. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Pratoman: Thanks for your views. In reading your reference numbers, XJC3 cited PSA numbers of 1.0 to 2.0 for certain advanced scans and Chuck referred to PSA numbers of 0.1 to 0.2 to consider commencement of salvage radiation. You're not viewing those numbers as being equal, right? I just can't imagine ANYONE risking the occurrence of possible metastasis while waiting for your PSA to hit 1.0. XJC3 takes the opposite view and suggests that EVERYONE should wait until the PSA hits 1.0 when a Choline scan MIGHT show a more definitive area where cancer has spread to. In my view, waiting until reaching a PSA of 1.0 post-surgery is a sure-fire way to lead to unnecessary deaths. I'd love to see a show of hands on the issue. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi XJC3: When I read the words \"...makes sense to do nothing until PSA reaches a level detectable by PET Choline or Acetate...\", I interpreted that to mean you supported that view. Our paths are very similar except you started your journey about 5 years earlier than mine. And with negative margins (compared to a small margin for me), you had every right to expect that your surgery was a slam-dunk success story. The fact that it took more than 9 years post-surgery and post-salvage radiation to find the spot just outside the prostate bed must be frustrating beyond belief. Hopefully, for the patients who come after us, that \"gray area\" will shrink and the tests of the future will be able to identify the location and source of any suspect cancer sites post-surgery. And, while I have good PSA numbers post-surgery and post-salvage radiation, I have little confidence they will remain that way in the future and I will follow you into some type of HT program. Fortunately for you, the HT seems to be doing the job. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Breezy: Well, it looks like we're back to Square One if your Dad has not had a biopsy. When you were asked for a Gleason score and your Dad's history, we thought a clearer picture would emerge, but without a biopsy your Dad has not been diagnosed with cancer because ONLY a biopsy --nothing else -- will make that determination. Not a blood test -- not a DRE. ONLY a biopsy. So, regardless of what the doctor may believe, as of now your Dad does not have prostate cancer. To repeat, it's not cancer until a biopsy says it's cancer. You really can make good use of Dr. Walsh's book to get a better understanding of the disease, including diagnosis, treatment options and follow-up. Best of luck, Jim",

At a PSA of 0.1 post-surgery, many ROs would be prepping a patient for salvage radiation.

As soon as I hit 0.11, I scheduled 40 sessions of SR after monitoring a clear-cut upward trend. This is exactly the reason why a single decimal point while monitoring PSA makes no sense IMHO because it lulls the patient into thinking <0.1 is just fine when, if fact, it could be climbing every 3 months (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.07) and the patient remains totally in the dark.

I suspect your doctor was sending you for an ultrasound to determine the size of your prostate and then would have likely taken the next step to the PSA test and a urologist referral. Many guys who come to this site for the first time have concerns that are similar to yours. However, you seem on the verge of expecting the worst when there is no evidence yet of anything that bad. Like Chuck said, gather the results from the uro and come back to us. We'll try to share our experiences and provide support to the best of our abilities. For now, calm down. The sky is not falling.

You have a fairly aggressive strain of prostate cancer based on your Gleason 4+3=7 score which requires treatment. The prostate should be the main focus -- lymph nodes are merely peripheral to the location of the primary cancer. Have you discussed this issue with your doctor? Best of luck. Jim",

As I watched the calendar, amazingly, I was completely dry on the 60th day and have remained so, ever since. As you have seen on this site, some guys are dry very quickly while others take a year or more to find the Promised Land of Dryness. For me, the catheter (my first ever) was more challenging than the subsequent leakage. Although there was never any pain involved, I found it to be difficult to mentally cope with. The catheter removal remains one of the best days of my life. Now, I primarily deal with kidney stones, two of which had to be surgically removed. It's always something -- kind of like an old Chevy with parts wearing out. Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome MK: On this site, most contributors naturally reflect upon their experiences with prostate problems. That's normal. But the symptoms you describe don't seem to fit with routine prostate issues, as stated by your doctors. Since you have a background in healthcare, have you considered the possibility that the discomfort could be coming from the remnants of kidney stones passing through? I know that it may be a stretch (pardon the pun) but my history, not shown in my signature, includes seven episodes of moderate to severe kidney stone activity in the last seven years, two of which required surgery to remove the stones. In most instances, the pain was crippling. If you have not already checked out this possibility, I believe accepted medical protocol is to have an ultrasound test of your kidneys and ureters. It may be a long shot but something to consider. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Welcome MK: On this site, most contributors naturally reflect upon their experiences with prostate problems. That's normal. But the symptoms you describe don't seem to fit with routine prostate issues, as stated by your doctors. Since you have a background in healthcare, have you considered the possibility that the discomfort could be coming from the remnants of kidney stones passing through? I know that it may be a stretch (pardon the pun) but my history, not shown in my signature, includes seven episodes of moderate to severe kidney stone activity in the last seven years, two of which required surgery to remove the stones. In most instances, the pain was crippling. If you have not already checked out this possibility, I believe accepted medical protocol is to have an ultrasound test of your kidneys and ureters. It may be a long shot but something to consider. Best of luck, Jim",

You ruled out surgery because you need time to recover and feel like you cannot do that while caring for your wife and there is not an alternative caregiver available for her. But when you add up all of the time when you are getting HT and 9 weeks of radiation daily, doesn't the same issue of caring for your wife come into play? The total amount of travel and treatment time are probably about the same. I seem to recall an old cliché about not allowing short term problems to interfere with long-term solutions, but I'm old and I'll be damned if I can think of it. Just a thought. Best of luck, Jim",

When you were asked for a Gleason score and your Dad's history, we thought a clearer picture would emerge, but without a biopsy your Dad has not been diagnosed with cancer because ONLY a biopsy --nothing else -- will make that determination. Not a blood test -- not a DRE. ONLY a biopsy. So, regardless of what the doctor may believe, as of now your Dad does not have prostate cancer. To repeat, it's not cancer until a biopsy says it's cancer. You really can make good use of Dr. Walsh's book to get a better understanding of the disease, including diagnosis, treatment options and follow-up. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "\"Since SR is usually only targeted to the prostate bed, and recurrence may be outside of the bed, then it seems to me that it makes sense to do nothing until PSA reaches a level detectable by PET Choline or Acetate.\" As a surgery and salvage radiation survivor, I am confused by your question, XJC3. If the tests you cited can only be relevant to identifying prostate cancer mets to areas outside the prostate bed after reaching a PSA of 1.0 or above, then they are of NO VALUE to a patient whose cancer is believed to be exclusively present in the prostate bed who needs to proceed with SR, as is often the case. That's because if you wait until your PSA reaches a reading of 1.0 to 2.0 post-surgery, you have given the cancer an opportunity to spread to those very same outlying areas.

      "Content": "\"Since SR is usually only targeted to the prostate bed, and recurrence may be outside of the bed, then it seems to me that it makes sense to do nothing until PSA reaches a level detectable by PET Choline or Acetate.\" As a surgery and salvage radiation survivor, I am confused by your question, XJC3. If the tests you cited can only be relevant to identifying prostate cancer mets to areas outside the prostate bed after reaching a PSA of 1.0 or above, then they are of NO VALUE to a patient whose cancer is believed to be exclusively present in the prostate bed who needs to proceed with SR, as is often the case. That's because if you wait until your PSA reaches a reading of 1.0 to 2.0 post-surgery, you have given the cancer an opportunity to spread to those very same outlying areas. Maybe I'm missing something here -- I certainly welcome more input from my forum brothers.",

      "Content": "Hi XJC3: When I read the words \"...makes sense to do nothing until PSA reaches a level detectable by PET Choline or Acetate...\", I interpreted that to mean you supported that view. Our paths are very similar except you started your journey about 5 years earlier than mine. And with negative margins (compared to a small margin for me), you had every right to expect that your surgery was a slam-dunk success story. The fact that it took more than 9 years post-surgery and post-salvage radiation to find the spot just outside the prostate bed must be frustrating beyond belief. Hopefully, for the patients who come after us, that \"gray area\" will shrink and the tests of the future will be able to identify the location and source of any suspect cancer sites post-surgery. And, while I have good PSA numbers post-surgery and post-salvage radiation, I have little confidence they will remain that way in the future and I will follow you into some type of HT program. Fortunately for you, the HT seems to be doing the job. Best of luck, Jim",

You're not viewing those numbers as being equal, right? I just can't imagine ANYONE risking the occurrence of possible metastasis while waiting for your PSA to hit 1.0. XJC3 takes the opposite view and suggests that EVERYONE should wait until the PSA hits 1.0 when a Choline scan MIGHT show a more definitive area where cancer has spread to. In my view, waiting until reaching a PSA of 1.0 post-surgery is a sure-fire way to lead to unnecessary deaths. I'd love to see a show of hands on the issue. Jim",

The husband of my wife's best friend is one of those guys who hasn't seen a doctor in 20 years, also age 69. He had really bad rectal pain. Finally, he agreed to have a colonoscopy and they didn't reach the midway point before finding a large malignant mass in the colon. He's had chemo and a colostomy bag (supposed to be temporary) for 8 months. Surgery is scheduled for February after the mass is reduced. Best of luck to your friend. Jim",

      "Content": "Steve: The marketing efforts on behalf of SBRT (Cyberknife, etc.) tends to focus on brevity rather than effectiveness. \"We can cure your cancer in FIVE visits. You must be an IDIOT if you're going to agree to 40 sessions of traditional radiation therapy\". But, sometimes it's best to stick with the gold standard (35 to 40 sessions), proven effective over decades. If you do a search of \"satisfied patients\" among all forms of prostate cancer treatments, SBRT -- Cyberknife, etc. -- is invariably at the bottom of the list. Massive doses of radiation all at once have not been proven to be a good thing, with respect to PC. I personally know of two friends with PC who live in Florida and who both underwent Cyberknife and both experienced radiation burns that penetrated the rectum wall. One patient is still in daily pain, three years later. SBRT seems most successful for isolated tumors, such as brain tumors, rather than prostate cancer that often contain multiple diffuse tumors.

As I watched the calendar, amazingly, I was completely dry on the 60th day and have remained so, ever since. As you have seen on this site, some guys are dry very quickly while others take a year or more to find the Promised Land of Dryness. For me, the catheter (my first ever) was more challenging than the subsequent leakage. Although there was never any pain involved, I found it to be difficult to mentally cope with. The catheter removal remains one of the best days of my life. Now, I primarily deal with kidney stones, two of which had to be surgically removed. It's always something -- kind of like an old Chevy with parts wearing out. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Jack: If I found myself in your position with a difficult G10 to deal with and a surgeon whose judgment you question, I would simply ask him if he is in no hurry because he has doubts about a favorable outcome. I know its hard to read those words but I would want to know his true views on the subject rather than just go through the motions. In all fairness, I would also ask the radiologist oncologist about his expectations that treatment will be totally successful. Then, with that additional information secured, you can move ahead with whatever treatment you are comfortable with, armed with a realistic prognosis. I apologize if that view is too direct, however I am a great believer in stepping back and looking at the big picture, without sugar-coating anything. I wish you the very best, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Fisher: I'm not the only poster on this site who has had surgery and, when the cancer returned, I needed salvage radiation to knock it down. But I would ask you to urge him to read my history and the current success that I experienced due to salvage radiation. As Chuck and Fairwind have stated, more information is needed for us to really get some perspective on his situation. However, if he is simply frustrated that surgery did not rid him of prostate cancer (and we don't know that without more details), he needs to know that others have faced similar situations and acted to resolve the issue and ultimately were victorious. You could point out that if he isn't willing to take the steps necessary to act to save his life, then all of the investment in time and the good work of the surgeon will be lost. And, yes, I said the good work of the surgeon because if the prostate is gone and there was cancer present, the surgeon has removed a major part of the problem -- called debulking the cancer. If he has thrown up a wall of denial, you could encourage him to receive a psychological consultation to try to figure out why he doesn't want to continue to attempt to fight to remain with us. BTW, my 40 sessions of salvage radiation were a piece of cake -- sailed through it without a single side effect. You lay on a table for 10 minutes while a machine circles around you. The patient feels nothing -- never any pain or discomfort, unless they didn't fluff the pillow. Best of luck, Jim",

At nearly age 77, your Dad beat the average by almost 3 years. My lifelong best friend passed at age 53, far below the average mortality age. I'm 72 and may possibly beat the average. I know it's hard to accept that someone who we love so dearly is subject to such cold hard stats but, outside of our control, we all create the \"average\" life expectancy.

      "Content": "Pratoman: In looking back at your earlier thread, I note that newporter gave you some valuable and insightful advice. Assuming you are still meeting with a surgeon in mid-December, you scheduled an MRI probe in late December and you have actually set up surgery for the soonest possible date, here is my thinking: I retired from a planning department -- in advance of implementing a Plan A, I almost always had a fallback Plan B written out. Use your waiting time to be productive. Write down the pros and cons (what is important to you, not to me or any other poster) listing why you favor each particular pathway to a resolution and the reasons why you don't want to pursue that avenue. For example, some patients just want the prostate OUT -- everything else is secondary. Others are more concerned with potential side effects -- ED, incontinence, etc. In my case, the decision was based almost entirely on having a back-up plan. Remarkably, my Plans A and B fell neatly into place 3 years apart. As you likely know by now through your research, if you have surgery first and the cancer returns, you can have salvage radiotherapy to eradicate any remaining or returning cancer. If you have radiation as your primary treatment, you can't have surgery as a secondary option (rarely speaking). In 2010, I chose DaVinci surgery. I was left with a small positive margin. In 2013, the cancer returned and I had salvage radiotherapy which, knock on wood, has left me with repeated PSA results of 0.00 over the last year. Of course, no one knows what the future may hold but so far so good. I must caution you that I am highly biased toward surgery first for the reasons cited and others on this site may strongly disagree. So, again, what's right for me may not be what's best for you. However, few would argue against creating a list and having a plan in place. And it won't hurt to have a brown paper bag next to the list if you feel like you may be about to hyper-ventilate. Remember -- all of the above is useless if you croak from having a heart attack worrying about something that does not rise to the level of irrational anxiety you seem to be experiencing. We've all \"been there - done that\". Repeat after me. You're going to be fine. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Chester: When you said \"early\" salvage radiation, you really meant early. I haven't seen any patient with SR commencement numbers that low (0.023) so far. I started SR at 0.11 and I thought I was on the early side. And, as usual, just as I start typing my question about how on earth did you get an insurer to approve it, of course, there is Michael already on top of the issue, as always. I suppose you are correct about the PPO, Chester. Throughout my employment career, I insisted on the superior coverage, even if it cost me significantly more, in order not to endure having to obtain \"May I?\" referrals from gate-keeper doctors whose in-network job and income depended on NOT sending a patient to a specialist, unless absolutely necessary. While my SR has resulted in all 0.00 readings in the last 4 years, I have never gone to the third decimal. Congrats. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Max: I was roughly your same age when I was diagnosed with a pre-surgery Gleason score of 3+4=7 in 2 out of 12 cores, which remained the same on my surgical pathology report. Although I didn't require adjuvant radiation after DaVinci surgery, I had a positive margin and my PC returned three years post-surgery (please see below). At that point, I had 40 uneventful sessions of salvage radiation three years ago which seems to be holding the beast at bay. The only side effects of the SR was some slight fatigue toward the end of the SR treatment. You are fortunate to have the downgrade to your Gleason score post-surgery. It appears from your path report that adjuvant radiation may be in your future, but most likely will be determined by your upcoming PSA test in 6 weeks from now. Recognize that your situation is not uncommon and there is no reason to believe that follow-up radiation (AR or SR) will not result in a true cure. Best of luck, Jim",

Personally, I would insist on receiving a copy of the test results as soon as they are available, regardless of whether they are positive or negative. You visited the hospital two days ago and he was given an antibiotic. But today you have a lot of blood in the catheter bag which concerns you both. My experience is that the squeaky wheel gets the oil. I would suggest calling for the test results, request a hard copy and advise the doctor of your concerns about the heavy blood loss. If you aren't satisfied (and some fellow posters may see this as an over-reaction), I would drive back to the hospital and badger them until you get the answers that you are satisfied with. Always best to err on the side of caution, in my view. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Chester: When you said \"early\" salvage radiation, you really meant early. I haven't seen any patient with SR commencement numbers that low (0.023) so far. I started SR at 0.11 and I thought I was on the early side. And, as usual, just as I start typing my question about how on earth did you get an insurer to approve it, of course, there is Michael already on top of the issue, as always. I suppose you are correct about the PPO, Chester. Throughout my employment career, I insisted on the superior coverage, even if it cost me significantly more, in order not to endure having to obtain \"May I?\" referrals from gate-keeper doctors whose in-network job and income depended on NOT sending a patient to a specialist, unless absolutely necessary. While my SR has resulted in all 0.00 readings in the last 4 years, I have never gone to the third decimal. Congrats. Jim",

It's unfortunate that you waited until age 62 to have your first PSA since you may have been able to initiate treatment prior to reaching a somewhat worrisome Gleason of 4+3 @ 90%. But as long as the cancer is contained in the prostate (the negative bone scan is great news), you can have every expectation that treatment will result in a \"cure\". I always hesitate to use the word \"cure\" because none of us really know what the future holds. Others will chime in shortly. Wishing you the very best outcome, Jim",

I don't remember the name of the medication used (others can probably fill in this part) but I was told that it identified locations where cancer may have adhered to bones by \"lighting up\" those areas like a neon sign on the scan. Please keep in mind that neither I nor others on this site are medical professionals and therefore the doctors treating your Dad can certainly give a much better explanation than my meager recollections. In answer to your question about the previous CT scan, it's my understanding that the full body scan is much more definitive. Oh, and the table is tilted in many ways to allow the medication to reach all parts of the body. Hope that helps. Please let us know how your Dad makes out with the test.",

At 71, he is already on the outer periphery of being a surgery candidate (my urology group usually recommends radiation at that age).

      "Content": "Hi Mom2two: Chuck pretty much answered your question in full. I can only add my personal experience. Prior to having my surgery, a full body bone scan was mandated. It was explained to me that if the cancer showed up elsewhere (metastasized), then surgery would not be an option. My understanding was that if I was not a surgical candidate, the doctors were certainly not \"giving up\" but they were conceding that a \"cure\" was not possible at that point. Then, the focus would shift from a curative pathway to a methodology to extend life. As you've probably read, there are many, many ways (radiation, hormone therapy, etc.) to accomplish that goal. But let's not put the cart before the horse (that cliché should show my age) and hope for the best results with the bone scan. Best of luck to you and your Dad. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Mom2two: Chuck pretty much answered your question in full. I can only add my personal experience. Prior to having my surgery, a full body bone scan was mandated. It was explained to me that if the cancer showed up elsewhere (metastasized), then surgery would not be an option. My understanding was that if I was not a surgical candidate, the doctors were certainly not \"giving up\" but they were conceding that a \"cure\" was not possible at that point. Then, the focus would shift from a curative pathway to a methodology to extend life. As you've probably read, there are many, many ways (radiation, hormone therapy, etc.) to accomplish that goal. But let's not put the cart before the horse (that cliché should show my age) and hope for the best results with the bone scan. Best of luck to you and your Dad. Jim",

In answer to your question about the previous CT scan, it's my understanding that the full body scan is much more definitive.

You mentioned that if surgery was to be scheduled, you had selected the open method rather than robotic because of a timing glitch waiting for the operation.

At 71, he is already on the outer periphery of being a surgery candidate (my urology group usually recommends radiation at that age).

You just learned at 4AM today that your partner living in another state has metastatic prostate cancer and you then come up with something called \"stadium treatment\" that doesn't appear on a Google search. Metastatic prostate cancer means that the cancer has spread to other areas and/or organs of the body. There is no magic bullet -- stadium treatment or otherwise -- to solve the problem. There is no \"cure\" to be found. Various treatments using radiation and/or hormone therapy can help to extend life. But without any details, such as PSA history, the biopsy results, the staging of the cancer, etc., it is next to impossible to help with any specific information. Please get back to us with any information you can share. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by regress Sage information, Jim. I agree that my doubling time is a big issue here. Do you know if, at numbers < 0.2 and a 4+3, cancer is likely to metastasize? Or would one typically need to have a much higher cell population (and hence higher PSA) to start to see that happen? Hi Max: With respect to your question about the likelihood of the cancer metastasizing, as someone who is not afraid to offer an opinion, I must confess that I would be overstepping my bounds to try to formulate an answer because I'm simply not qualified to do so. I think that's an issue that can best be answered by a medical professional. As you know, on this site, we are not doctors and can merely share with you the experiences that we have had -- both good and bad. For example, some patients select radiation as their primary treatment while others, like you and I, chose surgery. One of the primary benefits to surgery is that you have a second bite at the apple with salvage radiation to \"clean up\" any residual cancer. If you had chosen radiation as your primary treatment and the cancer returned, then surgery is rarely an option available to you. My urologist spoke of SR as nothing more than a house-keeping type of chore that sometimes occurs when all of the cancer is not eradicated at the time of surgery. As you can see from my history, it has worked well for me but, of course, no one can predict the future. I note that you have concern for side effects of radiation but that, almost always, relates to the experiences of those who choose it as their primary treatment, not SR. I can relate to you that I have never had a single problem of any kind from salvage radiotherapy and a number of other posters fall into the same category. Again, I wish you only the best -- except for the difference in age, we have followed a very similar path. Jim",

It's only natural that patients, like you, who are about to undergo the surgery, focus on this area. But, if you do, you are missing the forest for the trees. Shu put it best when he said your primary focus should be the eradication of the cancer. Everything else is merely peripheral. Some people do experience long-term problems but the majority deal with issues that I can only describe as nuisances, such as the catheter for 7-10 days and sort-term incontinence. No need to be afraid of anything -- Hell, if you have dealt with lung cancer, then as Allen said, this WILL be a walk in the park. Fairwind even printed out an itinerary for you. And you'll be able to tell everyone who will listen that your journey to a potential full cure for prostate cancer began on Groundhog Day. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Regress: Chuck is absolutely correct with respect to accepted medical protocol. According to guidelines, you should wait to begin salvage radiotherapy until AFTER you post a PSA score >0.2 on two consecutive PSA tests. I respectfully take an alternate position. Although you list a favorable surgical pathology report, you must accept that your surgery failed. Your cancer has returned (as mine did 3 years post-surgery -- please see history). Here's what you won't find in the protocol: As recently as five years ago, many urologists waited to send a patient for SR only after his PSA reached >0.5. As recently as twelve years ago, many urologists waited to send a patient for SR only after his PSA reached >1.0. Do you detect a trend here? I did and decided that I wanted SR when I hit 0.11 on the PSA scale and commenced treatment at 0.16. In my view, acting sooner is better than letting the returning cancer an opportunity to spread. In just 5 months, since Oct., 2014, your PSA has more than doubled (PSADT). That, in itself, should be a red flag to your doctor. Sometimes -- not always -- it's best to throw the protocol book out the window. That's just the opinion of one grumpy old geezer. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by regress Sage information, Jim. I agree that my doubling time is a big issue here. Do you know if, at numbers < 0.2 and a 4+3, cancer is likely to metastasize? Or would one typically need to have a much higher cell population (and hence higher PSA) to start to see that happen? Hi Max: With respect to your question about the likelihood of the cancer metastasizing, as someone who is not afraid to offer an opinion, I must confess that I would be overstepping my bounds to try to formulate an answer because I'm simply not qualified to do so. I think that's an issue that can best be answered by a medical professional. As you know, on this site, we are not doctors and can merely share with you the experiences that we have had -- both good and bad. For example, some patients select radiation as their primary treatment while others, like you and I, chose surgery. One of the primary benefits to surgery is that you have a second bite at the apple with salvage radiation to \"clean up\" any residual cancer. If you had chosen radiation as your primary treatment and the cancer returned, then surgery is rarely an option available to you. My urologist spoke of SR as nothing more than a house-keeping type of chore that sometimes occurs when all of the cancer is not eradicated at the time of surgery. As you can see from my history, it has worked well for me but, of course, no one can predict the future. I note that you have concern for side effects of radiation but that, almost always, relates to the experiences of those who choose it as their primary treatment, not SR. I can relate to you that I have never had a single problem of any kind from salvage radiotherapy and a number of other posters fall into the same category. Again, I wish you only the best -- except for the difference in age, we have followed a very similar path. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Hab: Do you have a family history of prostate cancer? While I'm not a fan of active surveillance, with only one core involved and a Gleason 6 and no family history of PC, I'm surprised that AS was not one of the options recommended. And although surgery and radiation, including seeds, are about equal in the success rate, brachytherapy (seeds) are actually selected by a very small percentage of prostate cancer patients. It sounds that, although this is your third biopsy, you may wish to investigate further. Our moderator, Chuck, should arrive shortly with a suggestion to buy a book written by Dr. Walsh, considered \"The Bible\" on PC. Per your question, as you can see from my history, I was one of those patients who experienced a return of PC following a DaVinci robotic prostatectomy surgery and I was able to receive salvage radiotherapy which, to date at least, has been successful in knocking down the cancer. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Regress: Chuck is absolutely correct with respect to accepted medical protocol. According to guidelines, you should wait to begin salvage radiotherapy until AFTER you post a PSA score >0.2 on two consecutive PSA tests. I respectfully take an alternate position. Although you list a favorable surgical pathology report, you must accept that your surgery failed. Your cancer has returned (as mine did 3 years post-surgery -- please see history). Here's what you won't find in the protocol: As recently as five years ago, many urologists waited to send a patient for SR only after his PSA reached >0.5. As recently as twelve years ago, many urologists waited to send a patient for SR only after his PSA reached >1.0. Do you detect a trend here? I did and decided that I wanted SR when I hit 0.11 on the PSA scale and commenced treatment at 0.16. In my view, acting sooner is better than letting the returning cancer an opportunity to spread. In just 5 months, since Oct., 2014, your PSA has more than doubled (PSADT). That, in itself, should be a red flag to your doctor. Sometimes -- not always -- it's best to throw the protocol book out the window. That's just the opinion of one grumpy old geezer. Best of luck. Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by regress Sage information, Jim. I agree that my doubling time is a big issue here. Do you know if, at numbers < 0.2 and a 4+3, cancer is likely to metastasize? Or would one typically need to have a much higher cell population (and hence higher PSA) to start to see that happen? Hi Max: With respect to your question about the likelihood of the cancer metastasizing, as someone who is not afraid to offer an opinion, I must confess that I would be overstepping my bounds to try to formulate an answer because I'm simply not qualified to do so. I think that's an issue that can best be answered by a medical professional. As you know, on this site, we are not doctors and can merely share with you the experiences that we have had -- both good and bad. For example, some patients select radiation as their primary treatment while others, like you and I, chose surgery. One of the primary benefits to surgery is that you have a second bite at the apple with salvage radiation to \"clean up\" any residual cancer. If you had chosen radiation as your primary treatment and the cancer returned, then surgery is rarely an option available to you. My urologist spoke of SR as nothing more than a house-keeping type of chore that sometimes occurs when all of the cancer is not eradicated at the time of surgery. As you can see from my history, it has worked well for me but, of course, no one can predict the future. I note that you have concern for side effects of radiation but that, almost always, relates to the experiences of those who choose it as their primary treatment, not SR. I can relate to you that I have never had a single problem of any kind from salvage radiotherapy and a number of other posters fall into the same category. Again, I wish you only the best -- except for the difference in age, we have followed a very similar path. Jim",

While I'm not a fan of active surveillance, with only one core involved and a Gleason 6 and no family history of PC, I'm surprised that AS was not one of the options recommended. And although surgery and radiation, including seeds, are about equal in the success rate, brachytherapy (seeds) are actually selected by a very small percentage of prostate cancer patients. It sounds that, although this is your third biopsy, you may wish to investigate further. Our moderator, Chuck, should arrive shortly with a suggestion to buy a book written by Dr. Walsh, considered \"The Bible\" on PC. Per your question, as you can see from my history, I was one of those patients who experienced a return of PC following a DaVinci robotic prostatectomy surgery and I was able to receive salvage radiotherapy which, to date at least, has been successful in knocking down the cancer. Best of luck, Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Regress: Chuck is absolutely correct with respect to accepted medical protocol. According to guidelines, you should wait to begin salvage radiotherapy until AFTER you post a PSA score >0.2 on two consecutive PSA tests. I respectfully take an alternate position. Although you list a favorable surgical pathology report, you must accept that your surgery failed. Your cancer has returned (as mine did 3 years post-surgery -- please see history). Here's what you won't find in the protocol: As recently as five years ago, many urologists waited to send a patient for SR only after his PSA reached >0.5. As recently as twelve years ago, many urologists waited to send a patient for SR only after his PSA reached >1.0. Do you detect a trend here? I did and decided that I wanted SR when I hit 0.11 on the PSA scale and commenced treatment at 0.16. In my view, acting sooner is better than letting the returning cancer an opportunity to spread. In just 5 months, since Oct., 2014, your PSA has more than doubled (PSADT). That, in itself, should be a red flag to your doctor. Sometimes -- not always -- it's best to throw the protocol book out the window. That's just the opinion of one grumpy old geezer. Best of luck. Jim",

And, if you did, congratulations, you have already won the first major step in dealing with this disease. If the cancer had metastasized in any significant degree to other areas of your body, it's likely that there would be no surgery. The people who frequent this site can provide insight into nearly every aspect of their experiences, before and after receiving treatment. Please feel free to ask any questions and, when you come out on the other side, consider sharing your story which may be helpful to others. Best of luck. Jim",

As a DaVinci AND salvage radiation patient, I would simply add the following: In my case, my urologist recommended and worked closely with a radiation oncologist following a PC recurrence 3 years after DaVinci....Although you have undoubtedly read that incontinence following a prostatectomy varies greatly among patients, if it is of concern to you after 4 weeks post-surgery as it appears to be, contact your surgeon and discuss the issue. The discharge paperwork provided by my surgeon suggested that I would not likely find dryness until the end of the second month....Your last sentence is exactly what I would suggest. However, at the end of the 2nd year after DaVinci with no evidence of a recurrence, many uros recommend a PSA test only once a year....However, playing Devil's Advocate as I often do (not to be confused with my respected forum brother ASAdvocate -- I'm highly jealous of Sweden, btw, with their disproportionate supply of hot blondes), I would like to mention two caveats: First, the initial Gleason score may not tell the whole story if there are higher-Gleason score critters still hiding in his prostate; Second, and this is a big one, many doctors prefer to not perform surgery on prostate cancer patients after roughly age 70 and depending upon the overall health of the patient. Since your husband is nearing that age group, I mention this because if he is going to fire the surgery bullet, the window of opportunity may be rapidly closing....As a DaVinci AND salvage radiation patient, I would simply add the following: In my case, my urologist recommended and worked closely with a radiation oncologist following a PC recurrence 3 years after DaVinci. In the 2 years since I received salvage radiation, I alternated visits between the urologist and oncologist as they monitored my PSA levels which, thankfully, have remained at 0.00....As a general rule of thumb -- and there are always exceptions -- in my doctor's group of 9 urologists, they lean toward surgery before age 60, it's a toss-up between surgery and radiation between ages 60 and 70, and over age 70 radiation is the treatment of choice. Even a person who is a \"fit\" age 77 may be encouraged to forego surgery to avoid a potential traumatic reaction to the rigors of surgery -- both open and robotic....However, just as I watched my PSA rise post-surgery and was prepared to act, you may want to ask his doctor at what \"trigger\" point he would recommend moving forward with salvage radiation. As \"Another\" states, sooner has been proven better that later....However, at the end of the 2nd year after DaVinci with no evidence of a recurrence, many uros recommend a PSA test only once a year. My feeling -- regardless of \"medical protocol\" -- especially with my history, is that I will never be comfortable waiting longer than every six months between PSA tests....Now, you say that robotic surgery, which has been available in many countries for more than a decade \"...is not an option here\". The other posters suggested changing doctors....Welcome Joy -- and fellow PA resident -- Go Little League World Series: I, too, agree that your husband's G6 stats lean strongly toward a path of active surveillance. However, playing Devil's Advocate as I often do (not to be confused with my respected forum brother ASAdvocate -- I'm highly jealous of Sweden, btw, with their disproportionate supply of hot blondes), I would like to mention two caveats: First, the initial Gleason score may not tell the whole story if there are higher-Gleason score critters still hiding in his prostate; Second, and this is a big one, many doctors prefer to not perform surgery on prostate cancer patients after roughly age 70 and depending upon the overall health of the patient....In the past, a post-surgery PSA reading of at least 0.2 at least twice was considered a confirmation of a biochemical recurrence. Many doctors have now trashed that and encourage commencement of salvage radiation at or near 0.1....If his doctor feels that a PSA every three months is reasonable, that sounds OK. However, just as I watched my PSA rise post-surgery and was prepared to act, you may want to ask his doctor at what \"trigger\" point he would recommend moving forward with salvage radiation....If accurate, combined with a G8 pre-surgery (what did the surgical path report show for a confirmed Gleason score?), you are almost certainly headed for either adjuvant or salvage radiation. I am most stunned that your doctor hasn't advised you accordingly, by now....After a prostatectomy, I asked my pulmonologist if the cancer believed to be in my right lung was related to my prior prostate cancer. He advised that when escaping from the prostate, cancer usually finds its way to the nearest organs (bladder, kidney, liver, pancreas, etc.) before it would reach the lungs....I'll keep you posted if we hear anything else too Wishing everyone a Happy Memorial Day Weekend and Good PSA test results Gina Hi Gina: Five years ago, after two hospitalizations for kidney stones, including one surgery to remove a stone that completely shut down my left ureter in unbearable pain, my uro started me on a medication (Urocet-K) to hopefully prevent future kidney stone issues. It's good to have a positive outlook for the future but be advised that these horse-size pills that I choke on twice a day, are not the panacea one might hope for....",
