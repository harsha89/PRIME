      "Content": "Thanks for all the pre and post-surgery tips. My husband\u0092s surgery went well and they found no evidence of disease outside the prostate. He had the catheter removed 7/5. The next day, he started running fevers (101) and feeling generally unwell. I spoke with the Urology resident on call, who encouraged us to come in to the ER (of course it was the evening). Husband declined. Fevers continued the next day so I called again and we went in and spent 8 delightful hours in the ER. The bloodwork looked pretty normal; slightly elevated wbc but nothing krazy. Urine test didn\u0092t show bacteria. Abdominal ct scan didn\u0092t show fluid/abscess. So eventually we were discharged. 24 hours later and he\u0092s still running fevers and now having to pee every 20-30 minutes. Has anyone else experienced this? Thoughts, recs, etc? FWIW he was inconsistent with the Miralax in the beginning and is now more backed up than the NJ Turnpike.",
