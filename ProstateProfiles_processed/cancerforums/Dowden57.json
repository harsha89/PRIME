      "Content": "Originally Posted by brownie43 Hello Dowden. You didn't say anything about \"leg Pain\". I am interested because my situation is very similar to yours. My PSA had always been below 3.0, then it went to almost 7.0 after I hadn't had it checked for a couple years. Now it is almost 16.0 and my Urologist at the VA wants to wait to start ADT until it doubles in 6 months or I get leg pain. What is your PSA? I had a couple Biopsy samples with Gleason 6, and the MRI indicated no significant Prostate lesions; however, it did indicate large Lymph Nodes, and a subsequent Biopsy showed that the Nodes had PC. I guess this is somewhat unusual in that the PC went directly to the Lymph Nodes ?? I guess no surgery is advised in my case seeing as how the PC is already in my Lymph system. The MO's at the local Cancer think I should be on ADT, and I am awaiting a 3rd opinion from another Cancer Center. Seems like everyone but my Urologist thinks I should be on ADT, and he is holding off to spare me the Side Effects of the ADT . Doesn't make much sense to me...Thanks, Brownie Yes I think the size is the tumor is pressing on nerves but that is my opinion. I had a clear colonoscopy so not sure what is happening with the lymph nodes but 3 were marked suspicious on MRI. My PSA is 8.5 up from 5.1 in two years. I don't know what ADT is? How did they confirm the Lymph nodes had PC?",

      "Content": "I had a biopsy in 2015 1 poke out of 12 positive 6 gleason non differentiated. Had an MRI the other day after a digital exam. Will be doing new biopsy on Wednesday. Colonoscopy on Monday. MRI shows extensive tumor on prostate. MRI also shows something in colon. MRI shows three suspicious lymph nodes. Not feeling good about the future? Dr says I might need radiation therapy. Not sure what to make of all this but I will know more by the end of the week.",
