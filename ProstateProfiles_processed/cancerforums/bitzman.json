      "Content": "I am 81 and have been advised by my urologist (surgeon) to seek treatment, either photon or proton therapy. I have decided on Proton Beam. I live in St. Louis and have visited the Indiana University Proton Beam Therapy Center in Bloomfield, Indiana. I also expect to visit Loma Linda. At Indiana, I could commute on weekends, so the logistics and costs are very favorable. However, since Loma Linda \"wrote the book\" I am emotionally drawn to that facility. Does anyone out there have an educated opinion as to which facility, if either, would produce a better outcome?",

      "Content": "I have tentatively planned to seek treatment at Loma Linda. However, I have been reading about pencil beam proton therapy as the latest and most precise form of proton therapy. I inquired at Loma Linda and was advised that they do not do pencil beam. A Procure installation is using this modality of therapy by virtue of having installed the latest hardware and software. Now, I am in doubt about Loma Linda. Can anyone out there help me through this dilemma?",
