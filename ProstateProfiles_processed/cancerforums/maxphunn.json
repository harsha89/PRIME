      "Content": "First post, hope I am doing this right. Today at my pre-surgical screening for ORP, I was told of two different forms of post-op pain mangement. One was the Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump, the other was Spinal Anesthesia. They were both explained to me and I was given a small pamphlet on each. I was also told that they would ask me what I wanted on the day of the operation. I have read some pros and cons for each, but I don't care for the idea of something else hanging from me (PCA) after the operation. Nor do I like the idea of a needle in the spine. So I thought I would post on here and hope to get some real info from those that have been there, done that.",

      "Content": "First post, hope I am doing this right. Today at my pre-surgical screening for ORP, I was told of two different forms of post-op pain mangement. One was the Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump, the other was Spinal Anesthesia. They were both explained to me and I was given a small pamphlet on each. I was also told that they would ask me what I wanted on the day of the operation. I have read some pros and cons for each, but I don't care for the idea of something else hanging from me (PCA) after the operation. Nor do I like the idea of a needle in the spine. So I thought I would post on here and hope to get some real info from those that have been there, done that.",

There are a few of us T3 guys here and they're all still posting. Keep your spirits up and remember that none of this is abnormal.

      "Content": "I got my post op pathology report from my surgon yesterday and it wasn't what I was hoping to hear. In short, positive margin. The stats are listed below in my signiature. He suggested I start thinking about radiation treatments, adjuvant or salvage. He said it is too early to decide, but I should start my research. My first post op PSA test will be in about 6 weeks from now (about 9 weeks post op). So I would like to hear from others that have faced this decision and learn from them about their choice and expieriences. Many thanks to the members that take the time to post all the helpful info on this forum. It is much appreciated.",
