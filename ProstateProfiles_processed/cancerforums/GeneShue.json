      "Content": "Hey gang in the the interest of sharing I thought I'd post the dietary changes and supplements added as part of my effort to throw the kitchen sink at my cancer. As you can see from my signature line I am about 3 months post op from a robotic prostatectomy. Although my 6 week post op showed no measurable PSA, Gleason 9 and positive margins mean that I'm in a high risk position. My surgeon recommended no action until my PSA starts to rise, but my own research, confirmed with information learned on this forum, led me to seek out other opinions. All of those opinions were in favor of starting radiation therapy now and not waiting. Those wheels are turning now and the RP will begin in 2 weeks. In an effort to do everything that I can to increase my cure probability I also explored hormone therapy. Again after getting several opinions and help from this forum I decided to green light the HT as well. My 4 month shot of Eligard was an hour ago. The final leg in my treatment tripod is the nutritional changes that I made about a month ago. I shared them with my uro today and surprisingly he was well versed in this area (his wife is a dietitian) and gave his thumbs up (I was doing it regardless based on my own research). It did make me wonder however why he didn't volunteer this information proactively. Oh well... for those of us looking to throw the kitchen sink at our cancers I suggest you look at adding nutritional elements to your arsenal. Below are the steps I've taken: Dietary changes: Ground flaxseed Two tablespoons/day Green tea 32 oz a day Broccoli A serving every day Eliminate eggs Choline effect on prostate cancer Eliminate dairy foods Except for yougurt Reduce meat consumption Increase greens consumption Add at least one large salad per day (w/spinach, kale, swiss chard, tomatoes, walnuts etc.) Mighty Green beverage 8oz/day Tomato Juice 8oz/day for lycopene Blueberries Two servings every day Supplements: Multivitamin 1x/day Kirkland Signature\u0099 Adults 50+ Mature Multi Vitamin D3 2000IU 2x/day Kirkland Signature Vitamin D3 2000 IU Softgels ECGC 350 mg 2x/day EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate) is one of the most beneficial polyphenol components in green tea DIM 25 mg 2x/day Diindolylmethane, a phytonutrient found in vegetables such as broccoli Turmeric Curcumin 1000 mg 2x/day Fish Oil 1200 mg 1x/day Kirkland Signature\u0099 B-Complex Kirkland Signature\u0099 Super B-Complex Vitamin C 1000 mg 1x/day Vitamin E (natural) 400IU Magnesium Citrate 200 mg 2x/day Key resources: Dr. Michael Greger - \"How Not To Die\" & NutritionFacts.org Dr. Andrew Weil - Various publications National Cancer Institute - Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF)",

      "Content": "Quick summary: - G9 PCa with recent biochemical recurrence after 2016 RP and adjuvant radiation and ADT therapy. - Traveled from home in Fort Myers FL to Johns Hopkins to meet with Dr. Mario Eisenberger on 10/10/18. Recommendation was to check my PSA level in 3 months to determine PSADT. Upon returning home I made an appointment for 10/19 with a local MO who my RO had recommended. I wanted to discuss the JH visit and several other things, including a potential visit to Dr. Kwon at the Mayo Clinic. I prepared a fair amount for that visit (some clinical trial results, potential participation in current PSMA clinical trials, etc., etc.). When i arrived however I met with the doctors PA who talked with me for about 30 minutes before informing that the doctor decided at noon to take the afternoon off - to play golf apparently. I was told that Wednesday morning is the only day that I could avoid that risk. Rather than reschedule for a future Wednesday morning I've decided to find myself a new MO. How do a research a good local (Fort Myers or Naples Florida) MO? Does anyone have any suggestions? My desire is to find a good competent local MO who would actually administer the treatment prescribed in consultation with other experts such as Dr. E, and potentially others that I may decide to visit in my quest for knowledge and treatment options when the time comes.",

      "Content": "Steve - As you know from our PM's, our numbers are very similar and we are heading down the same path. I figured that I would post a response here for the benefit of others who may be in the same boat. I'm just shy of 3 months post-op. My surgeon, who has done more Davinci robotic prostatectomies than anyone in the world suggested that I do nothing right now until my PSA starts to rise (currently < 0.1). As relieved as I was to hear that it just didn't make sense in light of everything that I had read in my research. I sought out 3 other opinions and all agreed that adjuvant radiation was the way to go. One of those 3 also suggested hormone therapy in conjunction with the RP, but given the side effects and the fact that 2 of 3 docs didn't recommend, I figured that I'd pass on this. And then...I received some information from you Steve that motivated me to go back to my Uro to discuss one last time. Again he stated his opinion that it wasn't necessary, but I brought a copy of a recent presentation by Dr. Anthony D'Amico on the benefits of combining HT with RT in treating aggressive cases and asked him to read it. He did, and called me back last night to say that he agreed that it was indeed worthwhile for me to do. So...I get my 4 month shot tomorrow morning, then in 2 weeks the RT will follow. Looks like I'm a few weeks ahead of you Steve, so I'll let you know how this affects me and how I learn to cope with it. The morale of the story guys is that you have to educate yourself - and this forum is a darn go place to start. Through it we can tap into other's experiences and through their medical resources expand our pool of knowledge that we use to make decisions. We aren't doctors, but it is our lives so don't be afraid to question their opinions and suggest that they look into treatment options that some of our brothers reference in this forum. Gene",

      "Content": "As Groucho Marx once said \"I wouldn't want to belong to any club that would have me as a member\"...and yet here I am. I won't repeat the information that you all can see in my signature below, but suffice to say I have a rather serious case of prostate cancer that I'm dealing with. From the very beginning I really had no choice but to remove the prostate. All of the advice received indicated that my cancer was too advanced, and I was too young and otherwise healthy to realistically consider other options. Thankfully there was no evidence of metastasis so I glad to even have the surgical option. After an extensive search I came upon Dr. Vipul Patel in Orlando, FL (about 3 hours from my home) who has done >12,000 robotic prostatectomies. I was very pleased with Dr. Patel and his team, short term incontinence was a minor issue and recovery was very quick. For over 40 years I've been very physically active...I'm afraid that I am a bit of an exercise nut. With that in mind, the short recovery period was a real attraction of the robotic technique. No disappointment on that front, within 3 days I was walking 5 miles/day and within a month I was back (carefully) to doing most of my cardio, strength and stretching routines. Now, at about 9 weeks post-op I'm at about 95% full strength. While I have bounced back quickly, there have been disappointments. The surgical pathology report was sobering - upgrading the gleason to a 4+5=9 and the presence of positive margins was not good news. In addition, sexual function has been non-existent. With the loss of some nerve tissue on each side I'm not optimistic about it's return, though the Vipul's staff says there is a good chance but in months, if not years. They have me on a \"penis rehabilitation\" regime - viagra and a pumped to get induced erections. So far all I have to show for it is headaches from the little blue pills. So...here's where I stand now and decision ahead. At my post-op meeting with my surgeon two weeks ago he was thrilled that my PSA was <0.1 and strongly suggested that I do nothing more, until and if, my PSA started to rise in the future. I however have done a lot of reading on this topic and came into that meeting fully expecting to hear that I needed to start adjuvant radiation therapy very soon. When I returned home I made appointments to see my local urologist, an oncologist and a radiation oncologist. All three were unanimous in recommending that I start radiation therapy in September. Given the high gleason score, the multiple positive margins and the very high decipher score (a predictor of cancer aggressiveness) they all believed that it was a mistake to wait. As much as I'd like to spare myself the exposure to radiation at this point, it just doesn't seem wise to wait. So, tomorrow afternoon I'm back to the radiation oncologist to start that ball rolling. Meanwhile I'm also pursuing the injection option for relief from the ED. Please feel free to express your opinions on the decisions I've made...or just to say hi. This may not be a club I want to be in, but I'm am grateful for the company of those who have been down this bumpy road. Gene",

      "Content": "Thanks for the good wishes. Re: the ED. First off, I feel a little foolish even raising the issue. I'm 59 and just celebrated my 37th wedding anniversary with my wife, who I've been with since the age of 16. We've had a good sex life for 40+ years so if some sexual avenues are closed, then under the circumstances it's certainly not the end of world. But...the loss of intimacy is tough in midst of this battle - and more for her than I. So...I hear the advice to be patient but I read conflicting things out there. So far, I've not heard from anyone who sustained significant nerve damage during their surgery, who didn't have a relatively quick recovery of that function, that subsequently did recover. Hopefully I'll get numerous responses to the contrary. I want to be patient, and in reality what choice do I have, but in the meantime I'm looking at other options to bridge the gap. The vacuum option hasn't worked well so onto the injection possibility. Not a pleasant thought and not driven by the libido of a 20 year old but rather by the desire to maintain that intimacy during the time it's needed most.",

      "Content": "MM16: Your case is very similar indeed. I was particularly interested in your comments re:ADT. My RO suggested that as well, and referred me to an Onocologist to discuss. That doctor however disagreed, as did my Uro. They essentially said that it was best to keep that in the arsenal for later...if it were needed. Tomorrow afternoon I see the RO again to formulate the plan of attack - I have a hunch he will want to revisit the ADT option. I'll print your reply and bring along for reference. I'm not sure what you are referencing when you talk of \"...what UC used for my case\". Can you explain? Finally...we have a couple of connections aside from our health misfortunes. My college football coach was a Michigan man - Harold \"Tubby\" Raymond. Quite a man and a HOF football coach. And...my RO is a UM med school grad ND undergrad. Lastly, I follow the Big Ten in all sports since my son graduated from Northwestern in '03. He was smarter than his dad and confined his athletic endeavors to the swimming pool, captaining the Wildcats for 3 years. Following his swim career brought us to Ann Arbor 3 times. I still have fond memories of those visits...and the sandwiches at Zingermanns!",

I'm 59 and just celebrated my 37th wedding anniversary with my wife, who I've been with since the age of 16. We've had a good sex life for 40+ years so if some sexual avenues are closed, then under the circumstances it's certainly not the end of world. But...the loss of intimacy is tough in midst of this battle - and more for her than I. So...I hear the advice to be patient but I read conflicting things out there. So far, I've not heard from anyone who sustained significant nerve damage during their surgery, who didn't have a relatively quick recovery of that function, that subsequently did recover. Hopefully I'll get numerous responses to the contrary. I want to be patient, and in reality what choice do I have, but in the meantime I'm looking at other options to bridge the gap. The vacuum option hasn't worked well so onto the injection possibility.

      "Sample": "I sought out 3 other opinions and all agreed that adjuvant radiation was the way to go. One of those 3 also suggested hormone therapy in conjunction with the RP, but given the side effects and the fact that 2 of 3 docs didn't recommend, I figured that I'd pass on this....At my post-op meeting with my surgeon two weeks ago he was thrilled that my PSA was <0.1 and strongly suggested that I do nothing more, until and if, my PSA started to rise in the future. I however have done a lot of reading on this topic and came into that meeting fully expecting to hear that I needed to start adjuvant radiation therapy very soon....My surgeon recommended no action until my PSA starts to rise, but my own research, confirmed with information learned on this forum, led me to seek out other opinions. All of those opinions were in favor of starting radiation therapy now and not waiting....",
