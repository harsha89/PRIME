      "Content": "Originally Posted by neutrondbob Just sharing that my brother whom got diagnosed with a low level (perhaps considered the definition of indolent PCa, parameters as mentioned by Brady Urology-John Hopkins) has done W.W. (surveilance-monitoring) for about 5 yrs. now and does not seem insane. His psa has not moved upwards and even dropped a small amount over this time. It is his choice and he has read up on the issues, has Dr. Strums book A Primer on PCa, of which is an excellent source of overall information. Some people enjoy quality of life while they monitor, even though their uro-doc or whomever naturally recommended immediate treatment as if W.W. somehow is non-existent as a choice. It is a real choice, maybe not an easy choice to stand by and live knowing you have some form of PCa. Leading oncologists are less biased about immediate treatment at having indolent looking stats or even little higher stats. Never easy black and white on PCa issues on any level, everything you can think of is less than definitive, might be incorrect data, could even have false positives (prostascint scans). As Robert Young mentioned years ago....'it is a jungle'. (his website: www.phoenix5.org) Let me give you a different perspective. My situation is slightly different as my PSA did rise over the last 4 years. I went through 4 biopsies over 4 years. The last one in June of 2009 showed 5% of only one core had cancer & it was a Gleason 6. This was after 48 core samples over 4 years. A case was made to me for watchful waiting by some on this forum. My urologist recommended external beam radiation since the tumor was so small but agreed that he had no problem with me choosing surgery. I had Davinci surgery on October 26th & got my pathology results on November 3rd. My Dr's greeting to me was \"You made a wise decision to have surgery.\" My cancer was in 30% of my prostate & the Gleason was upgraded to 3+4=7. The cancer was totally contained in my prostate. What would have happened if this 4th biopsy had not found that 5% in one core? When would I have missed the window of opportunity? Even though I am dealing with incontinence I have the knowledge of how much cancer I had. Hopefully, when I get my first postop PSA, it will be zero. My bottom line is that prostate cancer is a very sneaky disease. There aren't a lot of sure fire answers. I know the tumor in my prostate is gone so at least that is good news. My surgeon says that there is a 85 to 90% chance the cancer is cured. I like that much better than waiting & wondering. Biopsies are shots in the dark, a tiny little needle looking for cancer that is usually paper thin & might be located where the needle was used. I hate the incontinence but I chose surgery because with radiation I might have always wondered if my cancer was indolant & I had over-reacted or God forbid, if it isn't contained in the prostate I can always go for radiation in the future.

Fortunately, my wife & I both had flu shots a couple of weeks ago & we're old enough to have a natural immunity to the H1N1 flu.

It's ironic, as I get closer I am more determined than ever to get it over with! I've been through a lot of indecision since I feel healthy & my biopsy shows cancer in only 1 core. Some would say that with such a small sample I should do the WW thing. However, my Dad died of PC & I have that high PSA problem. In addition it's been 4 years of PSA rising from 6.0 & 3 negative biopsies before this positive 1.

When the hospital called Friday to give me arrival time for surgery, the nurse asked if I have a cold or flu. I told her about my symptoms. She told me to call my surgeons answering service if I get a temp of 100 degrees or higher. As of this morninmg, still no temp & very, very little coughing. My question for those who have been through surgery is, should I cancel? Second question is, if I don't cancel, will they still do surgery? At this point, I just want to get it over with. I would appreciate any thoughts, especially based on facts. Thank you & I'm sorry time is of the essence here.",

It's 8 & 1/2 hours since I came out of operating room. Some pain but they give me morphinre. Don't like stockings. Doc says he saved both nerve bundles.

Fortunately, my wife & I both had flu shots a couple of weeks ago & we're old enough to have a natural immunity to the H1N1 flu. My wife & I both have the same symptoms, I just hope I don't start coughing after surgery, it might hurt a little! I am definitely not looking for a reason to postpone this surgery. It's ironic, as I get closer I am more determined than ever to get it over with! I've been through a lot of indecision since I feel healthy & my biopsy shows cancer in only 1 core. Some would say that with such a small sample I should do the WW thing. However, my Dad died of PC & I have that high PSA problem. In addition it's been 4 years of PSA rising from 6.0 & 3 negative biopsies before this positive 1.

      "Content": "Well guys, no more prostate! Surgery took longer than expected almost 5 hours. Surgeon had trouble getting prostate to release. Dox thought this was a result of the 4 biopsies. It's 8 & 1/2 hours since I came out of operating room. Some pain but they give me morphinre. Don't like stockings. Doc says he saved both nerve bundles. This seems to be a great hospital but since it's my first time ever in a hospital I have nothing to compare witj. Thank God for Blackberry so I can pist from room.",

      "Content": "I'm scheduled for Robotic prostate removal tomorrow morning. For the last 5 days I have had a very slight sore throat & a bit of a runny nose. When the hospital called Friday to give me arrival time for surgery, the nurse asked if I have a cold or flu. I told her about my symptoms. She told me to call my surgeons answering service if I get a temp of 100 degrees or higher. As of this morninmg, still no temp & very, very little coughing. My question for those who have been through surgery is, should I cancel? Second question is, if I don't cancel, will they still do surgery? At this point, I just want to get it over with. I would appreciate any thoughts, especially based on facts. Thank you & I'm sorry time is of the essence here.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies. It could be stress, but I think it is a cold. Fortunately, my wife & I both had flu shots a couple of weeks ago & we're old enough to have a natural immunity to the H1N1 flu. My wife & I both have the same symptoms, I just hope I don't start coughing after surgery, it might hurt a little! I am definitely not looking for a reason to postpone this surgery. It's ironic, as I get closer I am more determined than ever to get it over with! I've been through a lot of indecision since I feel healthy & my biopsy shows cancer in only 1 core. Some would say that with such a small sample I should do the WW thing. However, my Dad died of PC & I have that high PSA problem. In addition it's been 4 years of PSA rising from 6.0 & 3 negative biopsies before this positive 1. In fact, I should feel lucky to be in such a good position when I consider what so many of youi have been through! Thanks to all of you who post on this forum. You inspire me! I'll keep you posted after surgery.",
