      "Content": "Hey everyone! I am new to this forum. First off thank you all, after reading a few posts on this forums it has really given me further insight about prostate cancer and bone mets. I am currently undergoing chemotherapy Docetaxel, 6 total cycles every 3 weeks also with lupron shot every 3 months. I am on my 4th cycle and currently my PSA levels are 0.071. I am feeling fine just sometimes worried about whats going to happen. Recently about 1 week ago they found something in my Appendix and they said it may be a second cancer. I did further research online and a few have said chemotherapy can form a second cancer. I have an appointment with a surgeon who will check on that. I am going to UCSF for my treatment. I am worried but am willing to fight this fight and have a lot of love around me Thanks guys!",
