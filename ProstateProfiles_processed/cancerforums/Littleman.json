      "Content": "Thank you for all of the helpful suggestions. We met with my husband's urologist and he indicated that my husband has a low volume intermediate risk cancer. His advice was to pursue active surveillance for the following reasons: age (nearing 74), serious side effects of radiation, better quality of life with a shorter life span!!!!! He said that he is not a candidate for surgery. My husband indicated that he has already had extensive treatment for leukemia including intensive chemotherapy and would prefer starting a radiation regimen instead of a wait and see approach. The idea of frequent labs, biopsies, etc. would be too much for him since he is already seen every three week for labs for his leukemia. I must admit that I am less than impressed with his urologist (who is a well known surgeon in the state). I don't need a good bedside manner if I feel that I am dealing with a top flight physician. That said, however, I do not feel comfortable with his advice. I asked him about genomic testing to ascertain the aggressiveness of the cancer and he said he stopped doing it because it was worthless. I asked about sending the slides to Hopkins and, once again, he said I could if I wanted but that he wouldn't complete the insurance paperwork for reimbursement. I asked why the MRI report suggested prostitatis and no masses and he said that MRIs are not a good diagnostic tool. I just feel that everything that I suggested (which I learned from my readings and especially from the forum) were discounted. He finally said that if my husband wanted, he would arrange for him to meet with the radiation oncologist. My husband is a strong man and has literally been in bed with death. His chance of recovery from his very aggressive leukemia and transplant was less than 20%. That was six years ago. Prostate cancer and its cure rates appear to be high so it seems that it should be an easier beast to slay. The problem is that we are both very tired of having to deal with another cancer and all that it involves. In addition, our hematologist/oncologist is a wonderful man who has been by our side at every step of this journey. I think that he has set the bar very high for other doctors. This urologist (who is at the same hospital) is less than caring. Thank you for allowing me to vent. I know what I have to do - search for second opinions and a more sensitive doctor. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

The initial MRI report indicated that the \"findings were suggestive of prostatitis\". We breathed a sigh of relief until I read today's biopsy report. My husband is approaching 74 and is a survivor of a very aggressive form of leukemia, including a bone marrow transplant 5 years ago. When his PSA started fluctuating, the doctor quickly said that he would not be a candidate for surgery, primarily due to his age. I will report back as to what the urologist says. We live in New Jersey and are seen by doctors at The Cancer Institute in New Brunswick, where he was treated for his leukemia. We are more that willing to travel elsewhere for a second opinion. If anyone has a referral, it would be greatly appreciated. I have learned so much from this forum. Thanks so much!",

The initial MRI report indicated that the \"findings were suggestive of prostatitis\". We breathed a sigh of relief until I read today's biopsy report. My husband is approaching 74 and is a survivor of a very aggressive form of leukemia, including a bone marrow transplant 5 years ago. When his PSA started fluctuating, the doctor quickly said that he would not be a candidate for surgery, primarily due to his age. I will report back as to what the urologist says. We live in New Jersey and are seen by doctors at The Cancer Institute in New Brunswick, where he was treated for his leukemia. We are more that willing to travel elsewhere for a second opinion. If anyone has a referral, it would be greatly appreciated. I have learned so much from this forum. Thanks so much!",

      "Content": "Hello again. My husband\u2019s PSA rose today to 7.4. He is being scheduled for a targeted MRI shortly which will be followed by a biopsy - either in the office or OR. Needless to say, we were both disappointed. His oncologist reminded me that prostate cancer pales in comparison to his AML battle which was extremely grueling. It\u2019s just the idea of having to possibly face another cancer. Thanks for your encouragement. I reread your posts and they are comforting.",

      "Content": "Thank you for all of the helpful suggestions. We met with my husband's urologist and he indicated that my husband has a low volume intermediate risk cancer. His advice was to pursue active surveillance for the following reasons: age (nearing 74), serious side effects of radiation, better quality of life with a shorter life span!!!!! He said that he is not a candidate for surgery. My husband indicated that he has already had extensive treatment for leukemia including intensive chemotherapy and would prefer starting a radiation regimen instead of a wait and see approach. The idea of frequent labs, biopsies, etc. would be too much for him since he is already seen every three week for labs for his leukemia. I must admit that I am less than impressed with his urologist (who is a well known surgeon in the state). I don't need a good bedside manner if I feel that I am dealing with a top flight physician. That said, however, I do not feel comfortable with his advice. I asked him about genomic testing to ascertain the aggressiveness of the cancer and he said he stopped doing it because it was worthless. I asked about sending the slides to Hopkins and, once again, he said I could if I wanted but that he wouldn't complete the insurance paperwork for reimbursement. I asked why the MRI report suggested prostitatis and no masses and he said that MRIs are not a good diagnostic tool. I just feel that everything that I suggested (which I learned from my readings and especially from the forum) were discounted. He finally said that if my husband wanted, he would arrange for him to meet with the radiation oncologist. My husband is a strong man and has literally been in bed with death. His chance of recovery from his very aggressive leukemia and transplant was less than 20%. That was six years ago. Prostate cancer and its cure rates appear to be high so it seems that it should be an easier beast to slay. The problem is that we are both very tired of having to deal with another cancer and all that it involves. In addition, our hematologist/oncologist is a wonderful man who has been by our side at every step of this journey. I think that he has set the bar very high for other doctors. This urologist (who is at the same hospital) is less than caring. Thank you for allowing me to vent. I know what I have to do - search for second opinions and a more sensitive doctor. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

      "Content": "I have posted a few times in the past several months regarding my husband's prostate cancer journey. To quickly update, he is a 74 year old survivor of an aggressive form of leukemia and was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. After an MRI and biopsy, it was determined that he has a 3+4=7 Gleason score in one of 14 cores. We have seen two Urologists (one of whom was Dr. Carter at Johns Hopkins) and two Radiation Oncologists and are confused as to which path to take - either active surveillance or a 6 week course of radiation. All four have stated that surgery in not an option. In Dr. Carter's words, it would be \"overkill\". Unfortunately, although all four gave us compelling reasons for each path, none can definitely suggest which would be best. As one doctor stated, there is no \"free lunch\" when making this decision. My husband is leaning towards radiation since he does not want to have to always think about this cancer. (He already struggles which the possibility of a leukemia relapse.) I lean more towards enrolling in the JH active surveillance program. Here are the troublesome issues: If he opts for active surveillance, we have been told that there is an outside chance that he may miss a window of opportunity for curing the cancer if this 3+4=7 turns out to be aggressive. We were told that this is a small percentage; however, it still exists. On the other hand, he could suffer from quality of life issues with the side effects of radiation which he possibility never needed in the first place. Have any of you faced this dilemma or know of someone in this situation? One hand, we are relieved that his cancer is in the favorable category (low-intermediate); however, the possibility still looms that he may be harboring something more serious. One interesting point, Dr. Carter at JH read his biopsy report and compared to his slides and noted that the suspicious area was not present on the MRI, and that the area of concern which prompted the MRI turned out to be nothing!
