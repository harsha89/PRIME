      "Content": "Originally Posted by Kgravy Hey all, sorry to ask this weird question. But, Ive been on the lung cancer forum for a little bit now. Been dealing with that for a little while (and no there has been no confirmation of any kind of cancer yet.) Ill give a quick rundown on some stuff but Ill be somewhat brief. Basically some lung nodules were found, and they grew and biopsy just said suspicious cells. Did a pet scan,those lit up a bit,but my prostate also lit up. I was asked all sorts of questions. I told them about the blood in my urine (have had it for years) my frequent urination, the lymph node in my pubic area thats always swollen, the \"dribbling\" of urine I always experience. As well as the constant waking up at night to urinate, and weird feeling in my hips, almost achey. Anyways, they did a PSA test (waiting on results) and also did a urine test. Urine test showed high level of blood in urine, as well as no presence of infection or any std. The rectal exam was also done. Said it was enlarged, and possibly some bumpyness to it. She couldnt confirm on the bumpyness but def said it was enlarged for a 26 year old. I mean, its slowly been getting worse for a few years, but I just attested it to anxiety. Now my question, isnt this odd for a 26 year old? I know infections can light up on pet scans as well, and maybe the urine test just cant pick it up. Im just confused as heck right now. Totally derailed my lung dr's current train of thought on what is going on. Now I go back to waiting for some more results and getting a gameplan built. Thanks for listening all, I appreciate it! Reading your thread make me wonder. Will a pet scan show cancer in the prostate with all the body funstions taht are going on there.",

There was a time in the early 2000 time frame that you could take pills and drank a lot of water. That was a breeze but since then they stop because they said the pills could cause kidney damage. The last one I had 3 years ago was golightly (spell wrong). It was a gallon jug with a solution in it that you filled with water and you had to drank all of it, nasty. One good thing about the procedure, at least in my hometown, they put you under and that is the best sleep I've ever had.

      "Content": "When I went to my home town urologist July 18th I made up my mind that if my PSA had gotten higher I would have a biopsy. When I met with the doc he said let\u0092s go another 6 months and if the PSA is still rising we will do another biopsy. I knew then I wanted to see another urologist because I could not believe he wanted me to go 6 more months. So I had my records sent to Vanderbilt. Met with the urologist there and as we were going over my records he saw the 5.4 PSA and said that\u0092s not to bad but then he said wait, did your last biopsy show atypical cells, and I said yes and he wanted to know how long ago was that and I told him over 1 1/2 years and he said you need a biopsy now. That kind of scare me because I could hear the urgency in his voice. So last Thursday I had one at Vanderbilt, 12 core. I asked what about doing a saturation biopsy and he said he only does that when a patient has had more then 2 biopsy and several high PSA\u0092s back to back. I thought, well I should be a candidate for that but he\u0092s the doctor. Anyway the nurse called this morning and said all 12 cores were negative and did I want her to send the results to my home doc. I said no, I want to stay at Vanderbilt. So without talking to the doctor I\u0092m not sure when he will want to do a PSA or another biopsy. All that worry (for now anyway) for nothing. Dec 6, 2011 PSA 2.3 Dec, 11, 2012 PSA 5.9 Jan 2012. saw the urologist who did a DRE and found nothing except enlarged prostate, set up time for biopsy Jan. 22, 2013 had biopsy, results 11 cores negative and one core a few atypical cells April 25, 2013 PSA 3.1 Oct. 29, 2013 3.3 Dec 11, 2013 had a physical from different doctor and PSA was 3.9 Jan 29, 2014 full body CT scan (for a different problem) found Prostatic Hypertrophy April 2, 2014 PSA 4.8, Free PSA 23% July 18, 2014 PSA 5.4 Free PSA 20% Aug 28, 2014 Met with Vanderbilt urologist Oct 2, 2014 Had 2nd biopsy, all cores negative",

I'm 69, so I've been going over my options just in case of PC showing up. I have a question; why would someone choose Active Surveillance. Once a person has prostate cancer and let's say he has a low gleason score and then choose's Active Surveillance, what keeps the cancer from spreading during the time between PSA test. I may look at it differently should I come down with PC but to me it makes sense to go ahead and take the treatment. It just seems that while on AS you start having symptoms that it has spread, it would be too late then.",

      "Content": "Just got back for giving blood for a PSA test. In dec 2012 my psa was 5.9 and it usually ran around 2.5. Based on that I went to the urology group who did a DRE and found the prostate was enlarged (I knew that already) and felt a rough place on the side of the prostate. So I had a biopsy and the results came back normal except for one of the 12 had a few atypical cells. He said come back in 3 months and repeat the blood test which i did. The results were 3.1 which I was glad they were lower but still not as low as it once was so he said come back in 6 months for a repeat test. Now I'm waiting on the results and wondering what he might do if the psa is higher. I guess it depends on the DRE assuming he will do one. Anyone care to guess.",

Yet it seems like that is the golden standard to use on people who have been treated to see if their cancer has come back. If you have scans and other tests and nothing shows up cancer do you still get treated because of the higher PSA.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago Well I do understand some of it as I've done the same, though you seem to be getting real specific. You may be like me, with a psa that just jumps around. Looking back, you had a 5.9 which dropped back to 3.1 Mine jumps all over the place. I no longer worry. I've had one 7.3 and one 5.5. My last one was 3.3. I've gotten use to the game and no longer think about getting a second biopsy. Anyway, let us know after your next one what the result is. Looks like its been 3 months since your last, which was up a bit, but with a freePSA that was OK. If you get another 4.8, I'd probably wait another 3 months and test again, before I'd do another biospy. You have to be careful, if you biopsy enough on almost any man age 69, they'll find a cancer. Mostly ones you don't want to find. Like a 3+3 in one or two cores, with a low percentage of each core. Then what do you do? BTW, I'm 64 and my father had PCa... lived 25 years afterwards, died of other causes. You are right, and I've thought about that too. If they look hard enough they will most likely find some bit of cancer. Makes me at times wish they never invented the PSA test. In fact I think I read articles where they stated the PSA test does not extend life. But I could be mistaken. And why did I take it to began with. It was just part of my physical that I have every year and I was not even aware of it till it exceeded the normal limits. And then it was just hard to ignore it and not try to find out what's going on.",

Are you afraid you will die on table or the side effects that may happen. You say your very healthy which with any luck at all you could live another 20 years, except for PC.

      "Content": "Immediate and severe funding cuts may curtail access to cancer clinical trials Statement by ASCO President Clifford A. Hudis, MD, FACP The nation\u0092s clinical trial network, which provides care to thousands of cancer patients across the United States, may have no choice but to abandon life-saving and life-extending research studies, including support for the patients participating in those studies, due to crippling proposed budget cuts. For decades, federally supported clinical trials have produced critical advances in the fight against cancer, representing one of the greatest returns on research investment anywhere. But this progress could soon grind to a halt due to far-reaching \u0097 and largely unnoticed\u0097budgeting decisions that are happening in plain sight. In the face of its own inadequate budget, which Congress should address, the National Cancer Institute has made the decision to end funding for federally-funded clinical trials in the community setting through the Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP). As of June 1, 2014, support for the CCOP program will end, jeopardizing care for thousands of patients in communities across the United States\u0097unless and until these research programs receive new NCI research grant funding that is not available until at least September 2014. This will result in a dangerous disruption of cancer care for patients who rely on these trials. The CCOPs are 60-plus community-based cancer research programs that make participation in clinical trials possible in nearly every community across America. To be very clear, they are being forced to choose between either ceasing research activities or self-funding it. At the same time, the new National Clinical Trials Network, which replaced the nation\u0092s previous Cooperative Group clinical trials system, faces a 40 percent reduction in operating budgets. This is forcing NCTN leaders to make an unreasonable choice: either halt critical research studies currently underway\u0097and in the process renege on obligations to patients committed to these studies\u0097or cancel planned and urgently needed new trials. Either choice spells the end or a significant slowing of research that could have delivered new treatments and more personalized and effective care to millions of Americans with cancer. These budget decisions mean that progress will slow. Life-saving therapies will be significantly delayed or not studied at all, local access to state-of-the-art treatments will be reduced, and patients currently receiving study treatments may no longer have expenses reimbursed or could even see their therapy interrupted. At a time when there are enormous and unprecedented opportunities to improve cancer care, America shouldn\u0092t be turning its back on cancer patients and science. Federally-funded trials have produced some of the biggest advances in cancer care, saving and improving countless lives over the last 50 years. We should not put cancer patients and our scientific leadership in jeopardy by interrupting funding for community-based cancer research. We urge NCI to restore budgets to NCTN operations to prevent the gap in funding to community-based centers that will cause this otherwise avoidable damage to our research infrastructure and progress while ensuring that patients with cancer receive critically important, life-extending care, regardless of where they live",

What's it hurt to get as much info up front so that I will have a better knowledge of what I will want to do and what surgeon I will choose.. I'm 69",

      "Content": "I've been reading this forum for over a year and right now I'm very nervous. I'll be 69 in June and you can read my stats below. The reason I'm nervous is, for the past 4 or 5 months I've been having a nagging pain in my lower back off and on and also the right hip. Of course my first thought was PC in the bones even though I do not know yet if I have PC. Last time I saw the urologist was 5 1/2 months ago. I went there today to give a blood sample and will see him next week for results. I was suppose to see him at the end of April but managed to get it moved up. When I went by there last month to see him sooner they asked why and I told them about the back pain. The lady at the desk said we do not treat back pain you need to see an orthopaedic doctor. After explaining to her my concern she still said no and then I just said, well, it burns every time I pee. She said OK, we will move your appointment up. So what do you guys think. The way my PSA is going up, could I have prostate cancer and could it be advanced enough to be in the bones. I did have a full body CT scan on an unrelated problem 2 months ago and the report said prostatic hypertrophy, which I believe means enlarged prostate, which I knew I had for several years. I think regardless of the PSA he will want to do another biopsy or bone scan or? Dec 6, 2011 PSA 2.3 Dec, 11, 2012 PSA 5.9 Jan 2013. saw the uroligist who did a DRE and found nothing except enlarged prostate, set up time for biopsy Jan. 22, 2013 had biopsy, results 11 cores negative and one core a few atypical cells. Only one lab saw the slides. April 25, 2013 PSA 3.1 Oct. 29, 2013 3.3 Dec 11, 2013 had a physical from different doctor and PSA was 3.9 Jan 29, 2014 full body CT scan, found Prostatic Hypertrophy April 2, 2014 PSA?, will know results in one week.",

May sound chauvinist but having a women stick her finger up my butt made me a little nervous, more so then a man doing it. But I must say it was the easiest DRE I have ever had. I guess it's the thin fingers and a women's touch. So my PSA was 4.36 and 34.4% free. The main doctor said I do not need to see him for another year. For me that means never. These PSA test for me generate more harm in anxiety then good.

The second biopsy(Oct 2014) found nothing. Since then have had several PSA done with my family doctor and the urologist. PSA jumps around some but never over 5.9 and mostly in the 4 range. My urologist at Vanderbilt, who I see once a year, called and said recent PSA is 4.2 and FREE PSA 47%. I said the free number sounds pretty good to me, what does it mean to you. Doctor said based on my age (73) and PSA numbers, I have a 12% change of getting prostate cancer. She tried to explain the math involved in coming up with that number but I could not follow. I guess I'm OK for now but those atypical cells still concern me.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mikla Good question. It's been awhile since I've read up on it but I seem to remember saturation biopsies can be don first when an imaging technique or DRE may have indicated an increased chance of cancer (and location). It seems logical that after one biopsy, a second one can be more targeted based on the results of the first. Typical number of cores I have seen range from 20 to 40. Forgive me if you've posted this elsewhere, but what was the result of your last biopsy? All 12 cores were benign. Since the nurse called me with the results I did not get a chance to talk to the doctor to see what happens if PSA keeps going up. I have an appointment in 6 months. I had this one, my second biopsy, at Vanderbilt thinking maybe they would have more experience in giving a biopsy. The only difference I noticed, comparing the first one with this one, was on a few cores he took, it felt like he was really pushing hard on that spring loaded gizmo they use. Maybe to get more tissue, not sure.",
