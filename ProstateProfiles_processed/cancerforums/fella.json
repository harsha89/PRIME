      "Content": "Hello everyone, This is my first post to the forum. A little background I'm a 50 year old male whose father was diagnosed at age 56 with PCa due to an irregular DRE. He had RP; however the cancer had spread beyond the prostate to the surrounding tissues (though lymph nodes were clear). Aside from extensive side effects from the RP he was symptom free for about 10 or so years but ultimately succumbed to the disease at age 72. I started having my PSA take at age 41 (2006). I have included the results below in order that I can frame my question: Oct '06 - 1.31 - Unknown machine/assay Oct '07 - 1.84 - Unknown machine/assay Oct '08 - 1.60 - Dade Behring EIA method (Hybritech) Feb '09 - NO TEST Feb '10 - 1.74 - Dade Behring EIA method (Hybritech) Jan '11 - 1.85 - Dade Behring EIA method (Hybritech) Jan '12 - 1.88 - Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics EIA (Hybritech)* Feb '13 - 1.44 (1.77)** - Siemens/Centaur (WHO) Feb '14 - 1.78 - Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics EIA (Hybritech) Feb '15 - 2.28*** - Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics EIA (Hybritech) Mar '15 - 1.39 (1.71)** - Siemens/Centaur (WHO) Feb '16 - 1.68 (2.07)**/# - Siemens/Centaur (WHO) Mar '16 - 2.40 - Roche ECLIA (assay unknown) * Siemens bought Dade Behring and this is the same type of machine ** Adjusted value as the Siemens Centaur uses the WHO assay which records a 23% lower value than Hybritech. *** Prostitis symptoms. Placed on antibiotics # - Again had mild urethritis/prostitis symptoms. All tests negative. Referred to urologist. As you can see, I started off with a PSA above the mean. Given my family history, this has always elevated my concern. In general my PSA has hovered around 1.6 - 1.8. However, my last two tests within a couple months of each other are showing a rise in my PSA. Specifically the one from this February which was at an adjusted value of 2.07 and the other about four weeks later at 2.40. Last year I had prostatis symptoms prior to my PSA test, and sure enough my test was elevated. The doctor put me on antibiotics and I was retested again several weeks later at which point my PSA had lowered somewhat. This year I also had mild urethritis symptoms prior to my PSA test (lighting strikes again?) and was referred to a urologist since the cultures my primary performed returned negative. The urologist said that it is not uncommon to see mild cases of non-specific urethritis and it should resolve which it did between the Feb and March tests of this year. I should note that the March test performed by new GP at a new facility I am feeling quite alarmed since I saw effectively a 0.36 rise in my PSA from Feb 15 to Feb 16, and another 0.33 rise in less than month from Feb to March of this year. I will admit that I am paranoid about PCa since I watched my dad suffer and ultimately die from it as well my PSA has always seemed elevated (though both my GP and the urologist told me that I have a larger than normal prostate for my age which may account for it?) My question is that should I at this point push for a biopsy?",
