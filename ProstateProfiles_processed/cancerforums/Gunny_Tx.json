      "Content": "I can provide what my pelvic floor physical therapist told me to do. 3 sets of 10 exercises, one each in the morning and evening while laying on my side in bed (this is a no load position, no pressure on the bladder or muscles) and one during the day while either sitting or standing. Anything more would fatigue the muscles. I was told to sit and pee as this relaxes the pelvic muscles and works on muscle memory. I was also told to NOT stop and start the flow. My PT hooked sensors to provide biofeedback and I watched on a screen during the exercises, I was clinching too hard and this feedback showed how much is actually needed. As for fluids, I was told no caffeine , alcohol, citrus juices or anything that would cause bladder spasms. I balked at the no caffeine and she said if you drink a lot of water to dilute it then you\u2019ll be fine. For the first week after the cath came out I stuck to water only. I had somewhat bladder control right after the cath came out, the bladder would hold urine and I could pee on demand but still had stress incontinence. Nights were dry with 1 or 2 trips to the bathroom. At about 4 weeks there was a significant difference in the stress incontinence, it was a lot less frequent. I am down to 1 pad during the day and 1 pad at night although not needed unless I dribble some sitting up to get up. I have been drinking 1 cup of coffee in the morning and maybe a beer or two on the weekend and I really don\u2019t see a big difference. Starting back to working out seemed to set me back a little, I think the stress of using the elliptical fatigued the muscles earlier in the day which caused more stress leakage. I found myself holding back the urge to dribble while working out. Hope this helps",

      "Content": "I am 51 yo and finished 38 sessions of radiation in July. After my daily sessions my bowels would feel a little irritated. My sessions were at 4:30 pm daily and then I would eat dinner around 5:30. By 6:30 my food was gone, in the toilet. My bowel movements went from 1 a day to 4 or 5 a day. Everything from diarrhea to soft but never hard. I did not feel fatigued or run down. It is normal, everyone has a different reaction but what you described is more of the extreme of the side effects. The part that isnt \"normal\" is the strange feeling since the biopsy. I would consult your Urologist for a second opinion. All my side effects went away 30-45 days after the radiation ended.",

      "Content": "Hello Thanks for the replies so far. I appreciate the feedback. I had my appointment with my urologist on the 25th. He explained a lot but, bottom line, he recommends surgery and he mainly does open. He said he has performed robotic with the DaVinci as well. All in all, about 100 of each. This is a military surgeon since I am active duty Army. He offerd to use the DaVinci at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio Tx if I desired but I think with him only having 100 and it is not his primary tool, I'll pass. The other option is open surgery at Fort Hood Tx. I do have a consult in for a Radiation Oncologist but it may take a few weeks. I have also been approved for a consult at Scott & White in Temple Tx where there are two very good doctors that use DaVinci exclusively. One issue that concerned me, my doctor stated that he would not attempt to spare the right side nerve bundle becuase of the PNI, too risky that it has spread to the nerves. I think I need a 2nd opinion on that one. He also told me there really isnt a difference in recovery between open and laparoscopic. This is contrary to what I have read. I ordered Dr. Patrick Walsh's book and will read it cover to cover. As an aside to a topic above, I was told that if radiation therapy is used first it may damage the prostrate and surrounding organs with scaring that will make it next to impossible for a surgeon to remove the prostrate.",

      "Content": "Hello Thanks for the replies so far. I appreciate the feedback. I had my appointment with my urologist on the 25th. He explained a lot but, bottom line, he recommends surgery and he mainly does open. He said he has performed robotic with the DaVinci as well. All in all, about 100 of each. This is a military surgeon since I am active duty Army. He offerd to use the DaVinci at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio Tx if I desired but I think with him only having 100 and it is not his primary tool, I'll pass. The other option is open surgery at Fort Hood Tx. I do have a consult in for a Radiation Oncologist but it may take a few weeks. I have also been approved for a consult at Scott & White in Temple Tx where there are two very good doctors that use DaVinci exclusively. One issue that concerned me, my doctor stated that he would not attempt to spare the right side nerve bundle becuase of the PNI, too risky that it has spread to the nerves. I think I need a 2nd opinion on that one. He also told me there really isnt a difference in recovery between open and laparoscopic. This is contrary to what I have read. I ordered Dr. Patrick Walsh's book and will read it cover to cover. As an aside to a topic above, I was told that if radiation therapy is used first it may damage the prostrate and surrounding organs with scaring that will make it next to impossible for a surgeon to remove the prostrate.",

I think you are doing the right thing based on age and biopsy findings. My report came back showing the cancer was confined to the prostate so I am glad I made this decision. If there were positive margins or other findings to show there was still some cancer remaining, I would seek radiation treatment after the surgery. IMO, this is the best way for survival.
