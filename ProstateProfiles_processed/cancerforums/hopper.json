      "Content": "Hi All And thank you for the support. I had been reading alot prior to the surgery date and questioned the Doctors office about any needed prep or tests prior to the surgery date and was told that unless they suspected something (which with me they didn't) they do there testing the the day of the surgery. The Anesthesiologist said my blood work and blood pressure were great but the last test was the EKG. They said if they had a Cardiologist at the hospital and gave an ok they still could have gone ahead with the surgery but none available. So.. they made me an appointment next Tuesday and said as soon as I was cleared they would reschedule. I still have good hopes and feel much better then I did a couple days ago. Again Thank you all.",

The doctor said I have atrial fibrillation and redid my EKG which came back the same. My surgeon came in and said they would refer me to a Cardiologist and once I was treated and cleared I could have the surgery. If not I would have to go with the Radiation. So.. I will let you know down the road what happens. Best to every one else.",

      "Content": "Hello This is my first post. Age 59. PSA of 4.7 on 9/14/2014, PSA of 6.3 on 11/12/2014. Urologist performed DRE and said slightly enlarged but was fairly confident that nothing would be found in a biopsy. Biopsy performed on 12/16/2014. 12 samples, 5 benign 7 positive with the highest being 3+4=7 in 2 cores. the rest were 3+3=6. Cancer seems to be confined to prostate. Negative bone scan. He suggested RP but also gave me a brochure to Cyberknife (SBRT). I did a lot of reading and decided to go with the Cyberknife until I had my appointment to talk with the Oncologist. The Dr. said he was surprised that I would consider it over surgery considering my age and my cancer being considered of medium risk. He also said that he would want to do HT for about a year. The HT was nothing I had considered. I read up on the side effects and I talked with the wife and grown Daughter and they both said I was moody enough and depressed enough already(which is true) to have the HT. I called the Dr. and asked if I could do the SBRT without the HT. He said I could but strongly advised against it. I thought OK I will have the surgery. I then talked to my Urologist and told him this and he didn't understand why the oncologist would not want me to do it without the HT saying that the cancer was on the low side of medium risk. He also said he would do the surgery without the HT. BTW both DR.s have very good reputations and several awards in their fields and I researched them both and found no bad reviews. Sorry for the babbling but just going a bit nuts trying to decide which way to go. So if anyone has any comments I would sure appreciate it",

      "Content": "Hello everyone I scheduled Da vinci surgery for 03/31/2015. I posted a couple months ago and since have read everything I can about surgery vs. SBRT and decided on surgery. Mainly because the Radiation oncologist told me I would need to take HT for up to 9 months and also suggested the surgery over the radiation. I told my Urologist and reminded him of past abdominal surgeries (splenectomy, a brief colostomy and double hernia which were like 30 years ago) and he said that since he only did open surgery that he did not feel confident doing the surgery. I did however get the chief of Urology at one of the hospitals to agree to do the Da vinci but said once he gets in if there is to much scar tissue he would have to close me up and I would have to do radiation instead. I guess I am not so nervous about the surgery but the after effects. I am not looking for answers but just needed to vent a bit. 59 years old PSA 6.7 6 of 12 cores positive 5 of 6 cores 3+3=6 1 core 3+4=7 from 2% to 90%",

      "Content": "Hello everyone I scheduled Da vinci surgery for 03/31/2015. I posted a couple months ago and since have read everything I can about surgery vs. SBRT and decided on surgery. Mainly because the Radiation oncologist told me I would need to take HT for up to 9 months and also suggested the surgery over the radiation. I told my Urologist and reminded him of past abdominal surgeries (splenectomy, a brief colostomy and double hernia which were like 30 years ago) and he said that since he only did open surgery that he did not feel confident doing the surgery. I did however get the chief of Urology at one of the hospitals to agree to do the Da vinci but said once he gets in if there is to much scar tissue he would have to close me up and I would have to do radiation instead. I guess I am not so nervous about the surgery but the after effects. I am not looking for answers but just needed to vent a bit. 59 years old PSA 6.7 6 of 12 cores positive 5 of 6 cores 3+3=6 1 core 3+4=7 from 2% to 90%",
