      "Content": "This could be answered on different fronts senior1957 and respect seems to be the core issue. Secondary smoke has been shown to contribute/cause cancer. Because you had prostate cancer probably doesn't put you at any higher risk than anyone else. Right now I'm somewhat driving my family crazy because of the healthier lifestyle I'm pushing around the house. While eating healthier won't do anything about prostate cancer (it's out anyway), but it will help mitigate potential other cancers like colon. That said, I think your main issue is respect and perhaps joint counseling might help.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by hcv I had my surgery 4/24/12 and had nerve sparing. My program has included viagara, cialis, or levitra nightly but I use a 50mg of viagara (when using this ) nightly instead of 25mg. At 5 months I added injections of caverject twice a week. I pump three times a week. Your program is good and should include self stimulation. I would also do injections if no significant action by 5-6 months at the latest. FYI- unless you are very lucky this is not an overnite process and can be very discouraging. I am ten months in and have some partial erections in the morning with stimulation - nothing for sex. I have not really had sex since surgery. It has been very trying for me and my wife. I would encourage you to use the injections to restart your intimacy. My wife and I had a lot of tension with the whole injection process and I use them only for rehab. I think my depression after surgery set us back. Try to be compliant with rehab and be realistic and positive- this is where I went astray. Good Luck. Thanks hcv. I can understand/feel your depression. It is very hard to explain to my wife the importance of the physicality of sex & penetration. Yes, the cancer is gone, but then the rest of life sets in. My wife has been wonderfully understanding and helpful in helpping me develop patience (yep, it's only been 3 weeks.) There is some feeling and I help it along as I can. I also found that manually stimulating her is relaxing for me and creates some response for me. It keeps physical intimacy going, at least staying in the game, so to speak.",

There is some loss of spontaneity but, the trade off is more staying power. Great to hear sgtt. My docs said to hold off have intercourse or masterbating until four weeks. (I've learned that listenting to doctor post-op advice is the smart path.) Good to hear the rings work. Sex has been much less a spontaneous exercise in the post-kid and busy life years, so some prep (as foreplay?) is not a big addition. Thanks for sharing your experience",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by sgtt I have never seen a post here about using the pump and bands to have sex. I use this regularly and my partner and I have a great relationship doing so. There is some loss of spontaneity but, the trade off is more staying power. Great to hear sgtt. My docs said to hold off have intercourse or masterbating until four weeks. (I've learned that listenting to doctor post-op advice is the smart path.) Good to hear the rings work. Sex has been much less a spontaneous exercise in the post-kid and busy life years, so some prep (as foreplay?) is not a big addition. Thanks for sharing your experience",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by hcv I had my surgery 4/24/12 and had nerve sparing. My program has included viagara, cialis, or levitra nightly but I use a 50mg of viagara (when using this ) nightly instead of 25mg. At 5 months I added injections of caverject twice a week. I pump three times a week. Your program is good and should include self stimulation. I would also do injections if no significant action by 5-6 months at the latest. FYI- unless you are very lucky this is not an overnite process and can be very discouraging. I am ten months in and have some partial erections in the morning with stimulation - nothing for sex. I have not really had sex since surgery. It has been very trying for me and my wife. I would encourage you to use the injections to restart your intimacy. My wife and I had a lot of tension with the whole injection process and I use them only for rehab. I think my depression after surgery set us back. Try to be compliant with rehab and be realistic and positive- this is where I went astray. Good Luck. Thanks hcv. I can understand/feel your depression. It is very hard to explain to my wife the importance of the physicality of sex & penetration. Yes, the cancer is gone, but then the rest of life sets in. My wife has been wonderfully understanding and helpful in helpping me develop patience (yep, it's only been 3 weeks.) There is some feeling and I help it along as I can. I also found that manually stimulating her is relaxing for me and creates some response for me. It keeps physical intimacy going, at least staying in the game, so to speak.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Patsuz1 What are your thoughts on all of this? Thank you in advance. You're on the right path. (See a thread I started about ED as some of the guys put great feedback in it). My doctors at Stanford (surgeon/urologist & ED specialist) advocate using - pills to initiate oxygenated blood flow into penis to restore/rejuvanate the tissue - pump to vacuum veinous (non-oxygenated blood) to restore volume and length If those do not restore function, then they recommend injections or a urethral suppository. Google this and you will find similar plans of action. I found U Michigan and UC Irvine prostate cancer departments had similar guidance. I take 25mg Viagra at bedtime to promote \"nocturnal\" erections and because viagra gives me the usual headache and screws up my vision (normal side effects). 50mg for me is just awful. They advised beginning injections in 2 months if the viagra does not move things along fast enough. The pump - weird is about the best I can say about it, but they said use it, so I do. Later on, I can try adding a little rubber ring to maintain the erection pumped up. A number of guys said this works pretty well. Note: viagra is expensive. The Stanford docs wrote a Rx and sent it to a Canandian pharmacy (don't know if mentioning name is allowed here). It is orders of magnitude cheaper. Ordering was simple. Am waiting for shipment to arrive. I wish you well. You are among people who care about your success.",
