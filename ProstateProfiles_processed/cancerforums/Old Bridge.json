Like you I am in my mid-forties and trying to find balance in a \"new normal.\" I wish you peace and comfort as you sort through this very difficult period of adjustment. Taking care of yourself is perhaps a bit more in your direct control than fighting Prostate Cancer. For me, I would fight with the greatest intensity to improves those things that I might have more control (BP, diabetes) to counterbalance those things for which I have little or no control (PC). But that is me. Perhaps it can be you too.",
