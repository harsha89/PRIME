I'm learning all kind of new words/phrases that I never wanted to know anything about. I'm concerned about Dad's high Gleason score and hope that the cancer was caught before it has a chance to spread. From what I've been reading, the low PSA when you have a high Gleason score can be misleading. Meaning, that ordinarily a low PSA would indicate that the cancer hasn't progressed much but sometimes if the person has a high Gleason, it just means that the cells aren't producing as much PSA because they're so abnormal. Here's hoping for the best...I guess we'll know whether or not it's spread once the results from his scans come back next week. I'm also concerned about any problems he may have after the surgery - especially if the doctor isn't confident that the nerves can be spared.

I'm hoping and praying that it's contained to the prostate. Initially, with the low PSA the feeling was that the cancer had been caught quickly and wasn't likely to have spread outside the prostate.
