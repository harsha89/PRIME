      "Content": "I'd not heard of presumptive disability before, but there is indeed a lot of info on the internet. Connecticut does include prostate cancer. As for a doctor not cooperating, I'd quickly expand my list of professionals by adding a Worker Comp attorney to the mix. Although my first call would be to the firefighter's Union, to see what advice/assistance they offer. Business Insurance, 2008 More than 40 states have some type of presumptive disability statutes for firefighters, according to the International Assn. of Fire Fighters. Although they vary widely, the laws essentially provide that certain conditions, from skin cancer to hepatitis C to heart attacks, are presumed to be job-related and compensable under workers comp, with some limitations. As a result, rather than firefighters proving that their conditions are job-related, the public entity has to prove that they are not, which observers say is a tough hurdle to overcome, especially since many presumptive conditions such as cancer and heart attacks are prevalent in the general population. In some states, the presumptions are not refutable. Presumptive Disability Law in Connecticut Sec. 31-294j. Eligibility of municipal firefighters, police officers, constables and volunteer ambulance service members re benefits for diseases arising out of and in the course of employment. Eligibility of municipal firefighters, police officers, constables and volunteer ambulance service members re benefits for diseases arising out of and in the course of employment. For the purpose of adjudication of claims for payment of benefits under the provisions of this chapter, a uniformed member of a paid municipal or volunteer fire department, a regular member of a paid municipal police department, a constable, as defined in section 31-294i, or a member of a volunteer ambulance service shall be eligible for such benefits for any disease arising out of and in the course of employment, including, but not limited to, hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, tuberculosis, Kahler\u0092s Disease, non-Hodgkin\u0092s lymphoma, and prostate or testicular cancer that results in death or temporary or permanent total or partial disability.",

Virtually any laboratory can perform a PSA test, but some labs are more efficient and careful than others. If you have a blood test, and your blood is then split up and placed into three separate vials and sent to three different laboratories, it's possible that you may receive three slightly different PSA measurements. For this reason, your doctor will order a recheck of your blood, particularly if you have an elevated PSA level, to rule out any possible lab errors.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by LILDOG When prostate cancer has spread does the psa usually rise first or pain at the site of metastasis is felt before the rise ? I don't know about the tracking of PSA levels, but I do know that not all mets are initially painful. For example, metastatic cancer in the lungs can be pain free and even symptom free until an advanced progression in that location. I think that for some mets, including those origination from the prostate, other tests [blood, CT, etc] could well pick up on a problem before pain becomes an indicator. On the other hand, pain might be the first noticeable indicator. \"Usually\" doesn't really help an individual assess their own situation. The same as stats on lifespan, reccurance, etc .... an overall indicator does not equate to it applying to an individual.",
