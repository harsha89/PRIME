Now is the time to relax, stay calm and start building an action plan. MF Thank you for this. I like the steps you have outlined. I like having something specific that I can do. I have a lot of experience in advocating for family members as they've been patients. I know how to do that. I've kept the notebook, asked the questions, written down the answers, filed the medical reports, tracked appointments and prescriptions. I've also learned when to overrule the patient and, for instance, call the dang ambulance already no matter how much they protest. I'm a strong advocate. I needed to know where to start.

Now is the time to relax, stay calm and start building an action plan. MF Thank you for this. I like the steps you have outlined. I like having something specific that I can do. I have a lot of experience in advocating for family members as they've been patients. I know how to do that. I've kept the notebook, asked the questions, written down the answers, filed the medical reports, tracked appointments and prescriptions. I've also learned when to overrule the patient and, for instance, call the dang ambulance already no matter how much they protest. I'm a strong advocate. I needed to know where to start.
