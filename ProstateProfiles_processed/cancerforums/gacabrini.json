      "Content": "Hello and thank you in advance for your help, My boyfriend is 54 year old, lives in NYC, who was found out several weeks ago that he had a PSA reading of 15. He saw a urologist, who prescribed a course of antibiotics. During the time he took the antibiotics, he seemed to have some kind of a cold or infection. After finishing the antibiotics and several days ago he went back to the urologist who re-tested his PSA level. His PSA level had \"spiked\" and was 22. He says that the urologist told him that he should wait for several weeks (not sure exactly why) and that the urologist does not think that he has cancer. I'm alarmed that the second reading went up. I'm not sure if I have complete information regarding the md's explanation, because my BF becomes irritable when I push him or question him about things. I've recommended getting a second opinion but my boyfriend does not think this is necessary. Any suggestions regarding his situation would be greatly appreciated! thank you!",
