      "Content": "Originally Posted by fasteddie paulplus, sorry to hear that you are a member of the club. Your stats indicate that you are in the early stage of prostate cancer. I would encourage you to get a copy of \"The Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Dr. Walsh. Read it cover to cover and you will have a better understanding of your condition. During your DRE did the urologist feel a nodule or an area of hardness? You definitely have time to research your next step. You may want to get a second opinion from a cancer center that specializes in prostate cancer. This would help you confirm active surveillance as an option. You will need to send your slides to them ahead of time with the pathology report. You need to know that 30%of the time the Gleason score is higher than the biopsy indicates. Keep us posted on updates. I am sure a number of more informed member will respond. Peace and Grace Ed Thanks you for the book suggestion. Will order tonite. No issues found during DRE",
