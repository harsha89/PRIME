      "Content": "Hello Everyone. Great to have a forum where we can share our experiences. Six months ago I had a MRI. Found no suspicious areas. It was negative. My doctor claims now a days MRI is about 90% accurate My PSA was 14.02 back than. Prior to that a year before it was 12.00 so its been slowly increasing, so my doctor scheduled another PSA blood test in six months. Six months later I now have my results but this time my doctor ordered PSA-Total and PSA-Free. Beside the PSA ratio is says not informative. but below provide some standard stuff Free PSA/Total PSA Ratio Reference Range Total <4: Prostate cancer unlikely and Free is not informative. Total >10: Prostate cancer likely and Free is not informative. Total >=4 and <=10: If Free/Total ratio >0.27, chance of prostate cancer is about 10%. If ratio is <0.17, chance of prostate cancer is about 50%. My PSA total is 16.00. My PSA-Free is 2.21. ug/L How do I calculate the PSA Ratio ? Is there some formula to use. ? Obviously looks my results are worsening but still wondering what to make of it because my previous two tests were PSA only. Is it not important to calculate the PSA-Ratio ? Too see how that plays into it. ? I do have an appointment with my doctor next week but as many as you know its an anxious nervous time so any input would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for help.

      "Content": "Hello Everyone. Great to have a forum where we can share our experiences. Six months ago I had a MRI. Found no suspicious areas. It was negative. My doctor claims now a days MRI is about 90% accurate My PSA was 14.02 back than. Prior to that a year before it was 12.00 so its been slowly increasing, so my doctor scheduled another PSA blood test in six months. Six months later I now have my results but this time my doctor ordered PSA-Total and PSA-Free. Beside the PSA ratio is says not informative. but below provide some standard stuff Free PSA/Total PSA Ratio Reference Range Total <4: Prostate cancer unlikely and Free is not informative. Total >10: Prostate cancer likely and Free is not informative. Total >=4 and <=10: If Free/Total ratio >0.27, chance of prostate cancer is about 10%. If ratio is <0.17, chance of prostate cancer is about 50%. My PSA total is 16.00. My PSA-Free is 2.21. ug/L How do I calculate the PSA Ratio ? Is there some formula to use. ? Obviously looks my results are worsening but still wondering what to make of it because my previous two tests were PSA only. Is it not important to calculate the PSA-Ratio ? Too see how that plays into it. ? I do have an appointment with my doctor next week but as many as you know its an anxious nervous time so any input would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for help.

      "Content": "Hello Everyone. Great to have a forum where we can share our experiences. Six months ago I had a MRI. Found no suspicious areas. It was negative. My doctor claims now a days MRI is about 90% accurate My PSA was 14.02 back than. Prior to that a year before it was 12.00 so its been slowly increasing, so my doctor scheduled another PSA blood test in six months. Six months later I now have my results but this time my doctor ordered PSA-Total and PSA-Free. Beside the PSA ratio is says not informative. but below provide some standard stuff Free PSA/Total PSA Ratio Reference Range Total <4: Prostate cancer unlikely and Free is not informative. Total >10: Prostate cancer likely and Free is not informative. Total >=4 and <=10: If Free/Total ratio >0.27, chance of prostate cancer is about 10%. If ratio is <0.17, chance of prostate cancer is about 50%. My PSA total is 16.00. My PSA-Free is 2.21. ug/L How do I calculate the PSA Ratio ? Is there some formula to use. ? Obviously looks my results are worsening but still wondering what to make of it because my previous two tests were PSA only. Is it not important to calculate the PSA-Ratio ? Too see how that plays into it. ? I do have an appointment with my doctor next week but as many as you know its an anxious nervous time so any input would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for help.

You might consider having it analyzed by a URO Radiologist who is highly experienced in detecting PC with MRIs. ASAdvocate makes solid suggestions that you should discuss with your URO MD. Also discuss in advance the metrics that will trigger a biopsy. Good luck and keep us updated! MF I am 65. My Uro said he would order a biopsy depending on my latest test results. I just got them today. My Uro sent me to his favorite clinic for MRI because he said he really trusted them for reading and being accurate. carmax17",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F i.e. Your % Free PSA is 13.8 - What is your age? - Was your MRI a 3T (Tessa)? - Has your URO MD suggested a biopsy? The (-) MRI is encouraging. You might consider having it analyzed by a URO Radiologist who is highly experienced in detecting PC with MRIs. ASAdvocate makes solid suggestions that you should discuss with your URO MD. Also discuss in advance the metrics that will trigger a biopsy. Good luck and keep us updated! MF I am 65. My Uro said he would order a biopsy depending on my latest test results. I just got them today. My Uro sent me to his favorite clinic for MRI because he said he really trusted them for reading and being accurate. carmax17",

      "Content": "Hello Everyone. Great to have a forum where we can share our experiences. Six months ago I had a MRI. Found no suspicious areas. It was negative. My doctor claims now a days MRI is about 90% accurate My PSA was 14.02 back than. Prior to that a year before it was 12.00 so its been slowly increasing, so my doctor scheduled another PSA blood test in six months. Six months later I now have my results but this time my doctor ordered PSA-Total and PSA-Free. Beside the PSA ratio is says not informative. but below provide some standard stuff Free PSA/Total PSA Ratio Reference Range Total <4: Prostate cancer unlikely and Free is not informative. Total >10: Prostate cancer likely and Free is not informative. Total >=4 and <=10: If Free/Total ratio >0.27, chance of prostate cancer is about 10%. If ratio is <0.17, chance of prostate cancer is about 50%. My PSA total is 16.00. My PSA-Free is 2.21. ug/L How do I calculate the PSA Ratio ? Is there some formula to use. ? Obviously looks my results are worsening but still wondering what to make of it because my previous two tests were PSA only. Is it not important to calculate the PSA-Ratio ? Too see how that plays into it. ? I do have an appointment with my doctor next week but as many as you know its an anxious nervous time so any input would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for help.
