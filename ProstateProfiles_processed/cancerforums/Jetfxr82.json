      "Content": "Well, it's been a year. First off I would like to say howdy....I kinda withdrew from posting the last few months . I just want to update my personal experience so hopefully someone else can benefit. Last time I posted I was post-op and was 100% continent and that's still the case. I had my 1st post-op meeting with my surgeon in Oct. 16 and if you look at my pathology report....well I had a considerable change in staging. The tertiary 5 and the EPE bumped the staging up to 3 although it is still called organ confined. It wasn't wonderful news but I am so glad that I went with the surgery. Now I know exactly what was inside me and it is gone. My doctor said I went from a 10% chance of BR to about 25%. I look at it as a 75% chance of BR NOT happening. BUT if it does I can do salvage radiation and go from there. The choice was difficult but with my age I felt this path would be the best choice for me. As far as SE's I can honestly say I'm better that before surgery. I went for years with low flow of urinary function and problems with ED. I now can fully empty my bladder and my ED problems are better. I take 20mg of Sildenafil daily and up to 100mg during sexual activity and thing are getting better. I also use a VED to help with blood flow. Things are looking \"up\". So I've put PC in the rear view mirror and mashed the gas.....he's still there but he's fading....getting a little hard to see in the dust.......but if he catches back up I'm gonna punch him with all I got. P.S. I hope that everyone that comes on this site can take something away from all the info on here. I know that when I first came on here my head was spinning out of control and I couldn't shut it off. I was numb from all the info and the Dr.'s pretty much leave it up to you to make a decision. I wish the best for everyone in their journey through this....no matter what don't ever, ever give up.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 Jet: Thanks for sharing. Glad to hear your doing well. One question. A t3 tumor is defined as having penetrated the capsule. Why is yours being considered contained? Thanks, MM From the report it says that I had 6 tumors present, 2 in the transition zone and 4 in the peripheral zone. The dominant tumor was located in the right posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, and left posterior peripheral zone. \"All tumor foci are confined to the prostate.\" [In the right superior neurovascular bundle region this tumor focus extends focally(less than 1.0 mm) into extraprostatic tissue.] So from what the Dr. said the EPE extended into the nerve bundle but did not penetrate the capsule. The tertiary grade 5 and the EPE upgraded the staging to pT3a. I'm not sure if one or both caused the upgrade, I didn't ask. The biopsy staging was T1C and the endo-rectal MRI did not identify anything other that the 1 large tumor I had before surgery. Glad the damn thing is out, now I just wait and see if I can stay in the zero club.",

      "Content": "Hey rooster, I'm 4 weeks out from RALP and after removing the catheter I had a burning/stinging sensation in my perineum area and the ureathra of my penis. It was bad enough that I was having trouble sleeping without having to get up every hour feeling like I had to use the bathroom. I went to my family Dr. and did a urine test and I did have a UTI. So he put me on 10 days of antibiotics and it is much better. I would say have a test done for an infection and go from there. Good luck. P.S. If you get to where you can't pass urine that is an emergency situation and you need to see a Dr. ASAP.",

      "Content": "I just had my surgery last week and did not have any scans other than MRI. I think is has to do with PSA level and the probability that tumor is organ confined. The PA that I saw the week prior to surgery double checked with the Dr. and he didn't order any scans. I asked another Dr. about a CT scan and he said he didn't want to give me cancer while looking for cancer. Said that a CT scan is equivalent to 500 chest X-rays. I think with us younger guys (40's and 50's) they want to be careful of not overdoing it. Good luck with your surgery, this was my first time for any type of internal medical procedure. 1 week post-op and I'm doing well.",

      "Content": "Just wanted to update my PC journey. I don't post on the forum often but I do check the new posts. I had my 2 year post-op check-up at MD Anderson yesterday and still had zero's for my PSA for the last 2 Yrs. They have transferred me over to survivorship care now and declared me PC free. It's was a great feeling although I know I still have to be on the lookout for any PSA rise. I will have a PSA every 6 Mos. with my PCP and go to MDA once a year for an annual check-up. I just want all of the new members and anyone just lurking the forum to know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and although the initial diagnosis was a heavy weight and a daze of trying to figure out what best to do for your PC situation there is hope and you can have a great outcome. I have no regrets for my decision to go to MDA and I found a Dr. and staff that did a wonderful job. Now I will continue to take care of my wonderful wife who has been there for me all the way. Back in Dec. 07 2017, a date that will live in infamy for my family, my wife was at work and had a seizure and fell and hit her head. After a trip to the ER and a CAT scan they found 3 meningioma's. The one on her upper lobe caused the seizure and was the size of a silver dollar, they did a craniotomy and removed almost all of that one. She was paralyzed on her right side for about 4-5 weeks due to the swelling. She is doing great now even after 36 rounds of IMRT on the upper lobe where they remove the tumor and 1 treatment of SBRT on the other 2 tumors on her spinal cord. She has been back to work since March and is as active as ever, just walking a little slower. So I will just say DONT GIVE UP. No matter what.....life is great and go live it up, cause you never know what tomorrow will bring.",
