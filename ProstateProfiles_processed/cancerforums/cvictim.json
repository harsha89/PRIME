I usually go on the tread mill or go for a long walk, around 30mins on tread mill and 3 miles outside. I also work out on the weights for about 1/2 hour. Not sure how long I will be able to keep up becasue the drugs do take the wind out of the sails..... But on a positive note spring is arriving real quick, then summer so that will boost my metabolism. The Sun is my Drug................",

In othe words Watchfull.Waiting. And some men wait till the PSA reaches about 10.ng. Mine is only .47. My urologist did mention that its better to start the hormone therapy when it reaches .30.. Having said that what if the PSA rises substantially 3 years after all this. Sometimes the Cancer cells become drug resistant. In my case I have to see the Oncologist soon and take it from there. If my PSA drops quickly I may get off the Drugs and keep up with the blood tests before going full blown with the Drugs and Radiation. Having a low PSA and not to be Chemically Castrated I may enjoy my summer, even if its my Last. Those are my thoughts. And been only 57 I still have some youthfull Testosterone that gives me Life. I had my Testosterone level checked last year its down about 15-20% from say a 40 year old.",

I have a bad lower back with 2 degenerative discs. One good thing about this is that I will be on Hormone therapy and Radiation maybe during the Summer and thats a good thing because I shine in the Summer months. The extra Vit-D from the Sun gives me a huge boost mentally and physically. From what I hear the density loss from Hormone therapy is ireversible. But I'm thinking if I work out big time after I off the hormone therapy I may gain my bone density back. You did have a Radical prosectomy..? How come you are still on the Hormones after one year..?",

I feel ok so my PSA could be 20.0 I may have a Pet scan but thats where it ends. I have heard of other men that opted out of the drugs and just went for the radiation. From all the reasearch I have done the Hormone drugs do not kill the cancer cells but just merely by you time without the quality of life.",

      "Content": "I hope a few guys tune in on this topic. Just want to get some feedback on the pitfalls of not having surgery done and opting for Brachy Therapy instead. So the doctor gives you the option of Brachy Therapy or Radical pros. surgery, for arguemnts sake your Gleason is 7 PSA is 8 biopsy is 40% left lobe negative margins. You decide to have Brachy Therapy and all goes well except for some side effects of course, nothing unusall. Your PSA after 12 months has dropped to 0.04. My arguement is you still have the prostate gland, cancer will eventually return will it not..? My doctor also said that PSA tests after Brachy Therapy can be very eratic and not accurate as well as having a cemented prostate and other damaged tissue surounding the prostate. I opted for Surgery, it hopes of not having prior damage to the area. Make sense. It has to me allthough now I will be having Radiation Treatment. Not all of us get away lucky with just having surgery and been good for 20 years. The other argument is a lot of guys had only a Gleason of 6, which is not considered an urgent treatment situation. Most of these guys could probably just do Rad treatement and/or Hormone therapy and be fine in 20 years.",

For me, I'm glad that surgery was my best bet because it is currently the only way to know the true pathology of the prostate -- which gives a good idea of what to expect in the future. Take care, Chuck I think that pretty well sums it up for me. Having read all the posts there does not seem to be a clear and concise decision based on individual circumstances and the state of the cancer, after all its Cancer and who really know what the future holds.",

And many men are going the Organic diet way, this is what I'm doing. I have been living with PC for probably over 15 years. My PSA was high 17 years ago. Symptoms appeared about 7 years ago. 2011 surgery 2014 radiation and hormone deprivation drugs..... Current PSA 3.9. And dont tell me I'm dying becasue I feel the same I did 2 years ago. Actually I feel worse because the drugs have taken some wind out of my sails. At any rate I will treat myself my way not the conventional Doctor prescription method..!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mikem350 Could you please clear something? If the scans are clear, how do they know where to irradiate? Radiation is suggested based on rising psa alone? How high is psa now, and your pain level? Am very curious because I am 8 wks post op and my psa is higher now, and may have to repeat the scans too. 8 wks post op with rising PSA is a concern to be taken up with your doctor. I had surgey 3 years ago. My PSA has risen to .49 in December 2013, normally they recommend radiation before it gets to 1.0. The Cancer according to the scans has not gone beyond the prostate region. But only time will tell. I could have metasaes in the lungs but the scans will never show that. My pain level is nill, taking Hormone drugs. I feel fine except for side effects from medication. I also had negative margins. But some of the cells are very agressive, this is what they found after the post op biopsy.",

What is your guys take on this...? I have heard horror stories from other Cancer folks that had surgery and post surgery showed no cancer present then 6mos to a year later Cancer spread like wild fire. Some urologists decline PC surgery based on late tests and later finding out that the patient had a high Gleason score and PSA so surgery is declined because chance of it Spreading. .....",

So many doctors want to give out prescriptions for cancer drugs and evasive scans and tests. If it aint broke dont fix it...! My experience a good diet and alternative approach like herbs or Marijuana. In search of better quality of life. Heroin is a better option. Lupron sucks Balls",

It will be useful to all of us who are in The Protracted Post Treatment PSA \"Watch & Wait\" Mode. Enjoy the achievement! MF I'am not going thru my docs, but as far as I recall my Gleason was 4+3. Pre op PSA was 6.7, negative margins, only left side of prostate was positive. Post surgery PSA was .02 then went to about 1.1 after 18 months or so. In 2014 April PSA was .04 pre radiation and during hormone therapy. Received hormone drugs for 6 months. I will have another PSA test next month. Currently I sit at 2.0 PSA.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Great & Fantastic news CV!!! Congrats! Can you share with us your PSA history pre and post treatment? It will be useful to all of us who are in The Protracted Post Treatment PSA \"Watch & Wait\" Mode. Enjoy the achievement! MF I'am not going thru my docs, but as far as I recall my Gleason was 4+3. Pre op PSA was 6.7, negative margins, only left side of prostate was positive. Post surgery PSA was .02 then went to about 1.1 after 18 months or so. In 2014 April PSA was .04 pre radiation and during hormone therapy. Received hormone drugs for 6 months. I will have another PSA test next month. Currently I sit at 2.0 PSA.",

      "Sample": "Don't know your husbands background but for the surgery was a cake walk. I had it done at 55 years I went in at 7am did the prep went down to OR around 8am, came to in recovery at around 10:30 am....\"So, did you have any lymph nodes tested? \" No, what kind of test is involved..? When I went for surgery he stated that the lymph nodes in that region were clear upon observation....For me, I'm glad that surgery was my best bet because it is currently the only way to know the true pathology of the prostate -- which gives a good idea of what to expect in the future. Take care, Chuck I think that pretty well sums it up for me....Some urologists decline PC surgery based on late tests and later finding out that the patient had a high Gleason score and PSA so surgery is declined because chance of it Spreading. ........I had it done at 55 years I went in at 7am did the prep went down to OR around 8am, came to in recovery at around 10:30 am. Surgery went like gangbusters....Apparently tap water that lacks Selenium is not a good thing for those prone to PC. I did a small test before my surgery and drank water from a different town, my PSA was 6.7 it actullay went down to 6.3, now is this a coincidence..? not sure because since 2011 I have had about 12 PSA tests and all were rising except for some Post-op tests....How high is psa now, and your pain level? Am very curious because I am 8 wks post op and my psa is higher now, and may have to repeat the scans too....I did a small test before my surgery and drank water from a different town, my PSA was 6.7 it actullay went down to 6.3, now is this a coincidence..? not sure because since 2011 I have had about 12 PSA tests and all were rising except for some Post-op tests. But that test was the only one where it dropped....What is your guys take on this...? I have heard horror stories from other Cancer folks that had surgery and post surgery showed no cancer present then 6mos to a year later Cancer spread like wild fire. Some urologists decline PC surgery based on late tests and later finding out that the patient had a high Gleason score and PSA so surgery is declined because chance of it Spreading....My arguement is you still have the prostate gland, cancer will eventually return will it not..? My doctor also said that PSA tests after Brachy Therapy can be very eratic and not accurate as well as having a cemented prostate and other damaged tissue surounding the prostate. I opted for Surgery, it hopes of not having prior damage to the area....Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH My own case was a Gleason 6, so it may not have complete relevance here. For me, I'm glad that surgery was my best bet because it is currently the only way to know the true pathology of the prostate -- which gives a good idea of what to expect in the future....\" No, what kind of test is involved..? When I went for surgery he stated that the lymph nodes in that region were clear upon observation. Am I missing something that should of been tested prior to surgery and prior to having Radiation to the Prostate bed based on the likelihood of cancer cells been present in that area when in fact my PSA was rising at the same rate After Radiation....I opted for Surgery, it hopes of not having prior damage to the area. Make sense....",
