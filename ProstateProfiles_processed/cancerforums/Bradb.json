      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Dr. Walsh's, \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\", most recent book edition is recommended reading.. Thanks for all the intelligent and thoughtful replies! I'm very impressed. I read most of the relevant parts of Dr Walsh's, \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" over the weekend and saw the urologist today. The book and this forum were very helpful when asking him questions. My choices are now surgery or radiation. I was initially leaning towards the less evasive radiation therapy. My wife and I are going on 7 week vacation next week back to the US. The radiation specialist is booked to discuss it when we return to NZ. My dilemma: I can go with surgery and have it scheduled when we return. If I wait to talk to the radiation specialists, and then decide to go with surgery it will be another 6-8 weeks. In his book, Dr Walsh recommends surgery for people with lower intermediate prostate cancer like mine who expect to live 20 years or more - considering family history and current health (which is my case at 63 -my family seem to mostly live between 80-100+). Open Prostatectomy results are more certain. And radiation can be used as a mop up. Another problem in our mostly public system is that I\u2019ll have no choice of the surgeon\u2026it is a lottery, unless I go private (at 16-20k NZD or 10.5-13.5 USD, and almost twice as much for robotic surgery). Radiation in our location is only available publically. It is free. I\u2019m not sure about brachytherapy. My wife and I thought that the urologist seemed very nice, trustworthy and intelligent. He is not pushy on the method or whom I use. He is youngish with 100 or so surgeries under his belt. He said he about 84% of his patients had negative margins. (He, unlike some surgeons operates on quite advanced cases.) He said he that none of his patients were incontinent after 2 years\u2026 none so far need artificial sphincters. It is a small country so it is hard to lie about these things. All the specialists more or less know about each other. He also said he could get me in touch with a doctor who had done 300+ operations if I wanted to. But his small city is close, an hour drive to where we live - good in case of complications. With all these factors I\u2019m thinking of spending the money (12.5k USD) and using him. I\u2019ve easily saved that much by discontinuing my health insurance when I was 50. (The public system here has been very good to me so far, but I\u2019d like to choose my surgeon, if I go that route.) Or should I spring for a top urologist at a \u201cdistant\u201d city (meaning a 4-6 hour drive)? Or radiation? My son (an intern) says flip a coin.",

      "Content": "Hello, I\u2019m generally a reasonably healthy 63 year old. I just found out that I have prostate cancer from my GP. I see the specialist next week. I\u2019d like to be armed with information before talking to him. I moved to New Zealand from NYC 23 years ago. Here most use the \"free\" public system, but if one has insurance or a lot of money private is available. My biopsy read 2 (out of 12 cores) both with a 3+4 Gleason score. My PSA has been at 3.9 and 3.7. I have no family history of cancer. (Indeed most live fairly long \u2013 my mom a smoker until 93 and lived to 94,; my Dad also a smoker, who was 68 when I was born, lived to 80, and his sister 101.) My question is: am I pretty much doomed to wearing diapers for the rest of my life with normal treatment? A friend, who also has PC (with slightly worse Gleason readings) insists that incontinence and impotency are almost inevitable. He\u2019s been to support group where 18 out of 20 were still incontinent\u2026though it could be a skewed group since the ones happy with treatment probably aren\u2019t there. He won\u2019t get treatment and is using Active Surveillance, a lot of exercise and a strict diet. The publicly available treatments here in New Zealand are traditional radiation and non-robotic surgery. Brachytherapy is available privately. But high dose brachytherapy combined with the traditional radiation treatment which is available publicly for more advanced cases. Nanoknife surgery is available privately. Approximately 25- 30% of kiwi have private insurance. The public health system is quite good. I'm pretty active. I exercise every day and go tot the gym in early retirement. Leakage could put a big damper on my life. Any suggestions?",

Open Prostatectomy results are more certain. And radiation can be used as a mop up. Another problem in our mostly public system is that I\u2019ll have no choice of the surgeon\u2026it is a lottery, unless I go private (at 16-20k NZD or 10.5-13.5 USD, and almost twice as much for robotic surgery). Radiation in our location is only available publically. It is free. I\u2019m not sure about brachytherapy. My wife and I thought that the urologist seemed very nice, trustworthy and intelligent. He is not pushy on the method or whom I use. He is youngish with 100 or so surgeries under his belt. He said he about 84% of his patients had negative margins. (He, unlike some surgeons operates on quite advanced cases.) He said he that none of his patients were incontinent after 2 years\u2026 none so far need artificial sphincters. It is a small country so it is hard to lie about these things. All the specialists more or less know about each other. He also said he could get me in touch with a doctor who had done 300+ operations if I wanted to. But his small city is close, an hour drive to where we live - good in case of complications. With all these factors I\u2019m thinking of spending the money (12.5k USD) and using him. I\u2019ve easily saved that much by discontinuing my health insurance when I was 50. (The public system here has been very good to me so far, but I\u2019d like to choose my surgeon, if I go that route.) Or should I spring for a top urologist at a \u201cdistant\u201d city (meaning a 4-6 hour drive)? Or radiation? My son (an intern) says flip a coin.",

He\u2019s been to support group where 18 out of 20 were still incontinent\u2026though it could be a skewed group since the ones happy with treatment probably aren\u2019t there. He won\u2019t get treatment and is using Active Surveillance, a lot of exercise and a strict diet. The publicly available treatments here in New Zealand are traditional radiation and non-robotic surgery. Brachytherapy is available privately. But high dose brachytherapy combined with the traditional radiation treatment which is available publicly for more advanced cases. Nanoknife surgery is available privately. Approximately 25- 30% of kiwi have private insurance. The public health system is quite good. I'm pretty active. I exercise every day and go tot the gym in early retirement. Leakage could put a big damper on my life. Any suggestions?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Dr. Walsh's, \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\", most recent book edition is recommended reading.. Thanks for all the intelligent and thoughtful replies! I'm very impressed. I read most of the relevant parts of Dr Walsh's, \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" over the weekend and saw the urologist today. The book and this forum were very helpful when asking him questions. My choices are now surgery or radiation. I was initially leaning towards the less evasive radiation therapy. My wife and I are going on 7 week vacation next week back to the US. The radiation specialist is booked to discuss it when we return to NZ. My dilemma: I can go with surgery and have it scheduled when we return. If I wait to talk to the radiation specialists, and then decide to go with surgery it will be another 6-8 weeks. In his book, Dr Walsh recommends surgery for people with lower intermediate prostate cancer like mine who expect to live 20 years or more - considering family history and current health (which is my case at 63 -my family seem to mostly live between 80-100+). Open Prostatectomy results are more certain. And radiation can be used as a mop up. Another problem in our mostly public system is that I\u2019ll have no choice of the surgeon\u2026it is a lottery, unless I go private (at 16-20k NZD or 10.5-13.5 USD, and almost twice as much for robotic surgery). Radiation in our location is only available publically. It is free. I\u2019m not sure about brachytherapy. My wife and I thought that the urologist seemed very nice, trustworthy and intelligent. He is not pushy on the method or whom I use. He is youngish with 100 or so surgeries under his belt. He said he about 84% of his patients had negative margins. (He, unlike some surgeons operates on quite advanced cases.) He said he that none of his patients were incontinent after 2 years\u2026 none so far need artificial sphincters. It is a small country so it is hard to lie about these things. All the specialists more or less know about each other. He also said he could get me in touch with a doctor who had done 300+ operations if I wanted to. But his small city is close, an hour drive to where we live - good in case of complications. With all these factors I\u2019m thinking of spending the money (12.5k USD) and using him. I\u2019ve easily saved that much by discontinuing my health insurance when I was 50. (The public system here has been very good to me so far, but I\u2019d like to choose my surgeon, if I go that route.) Or should I spring for a top urologist at a \u201cdistant\u201d city (meaning a 4-6 hour drive)? Or radiation? My son (an intern) says flip a coin.",
