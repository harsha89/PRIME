    "Content": "My age is 62 and have been lifting weights, bicycling, and other activities for years and have always had great health. My diet for 42 years has been very unconventional eating 20 raw eggs in protein/milk shakes, one medium steak or greasy hamburger, yogurt and cheese for all my meals each day. But however I'm a driver of paratransit buses and sit for 8 to 10 hours per day 5 days a week and in the last year I hadn't done any exercise period and suspected that my inactivity and sitting in the same position for those hours was the reason I had these blood clots I did no walking, nothing and would go home turn on the tv and then go to sleep? I just don't know the answer ? I now realize that eggs have vit K that contributes to clotting as well as greasy hamburger. How it all started, I hadn't felt well for about 2 months first I had a cold, then towards the end of that followed with a sore throat felt like strep throat it was very raw and painful. Once I started getting over that throat thing I started to come down with bronchitis or what I thought to be bronchitis since I was born with it and I do get it every so many years apart last time I had it was 1992. After about two and a half weeks of that I noticed it started to become difficult to breathe deeply I was walking about 20 feet and getting completely out of breathe. I thought I would go see my allergist since I have pollen allergies, the allergist said to just get rest and ride it out its just real bad bronchitis. After a few more days I thought I've never been like this with bronchitis and went to urgent care at Highland Hospital in Oakland (I have no health care insurance). After a scan with contrast die and a chest x ray they found 2 blood clots in the lungs. They also found that my thyroid was slightly enlarged. They took blood test had me on blood thinners etc. etc. after 3 days in the hospital the doctor team (6 doctors) came to visit and suggested I stay an additional 7 days for more tests. They said that they suspected prostate cancer and also wanted to do a prostate biopsy along with a camera inserted up my rear end. Well all of this scared the you know what out of me and I declined as I didn't really trust what they were telling me about needing the additional tests. I needed to get out of there in order to regroup my thoughts and think about what options and proceed cautiously with some knowledge of what would be a sensible approach. Doing as much reading and searching the internet I'm thinking to do a FPSA first then see what I have, then go forward from there. I understand that biopsy is not accurate and also can spread cancer cells to other areas other than the prostate. I would appreciate some sensible suggestions and opinions to what could be going on.Thank you. p.s. I have changed my diet to more of a well balanced conventional diet and yes I lived very well on the diet I mentioned and the saturated fat was used as fuel or energy. Take into account that all these years from age 20 to my current age of 62 I hadn't had any issues with my health except hay fever. Every time I went to the doctors and they did all the blood work it would show everything was normal good and bad cholesterol were perfect then the doctor would say you are doing something right keep on the same road.",
