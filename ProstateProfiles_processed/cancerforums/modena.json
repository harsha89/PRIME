I did get an ultrasound as well that showed enlargement and was put on a 10 day antibiotic. On your advice I will call the urologist and request someone from their office (even if its just a PA) to give me the details of the procedure and I will definitely ask about an extended PSA (thanks Dave)...It also helps the shock to know that this is a very normal procedure (thanks Highlander)... If the biopsy is necessary, is there a number of samples I should insist on or is it variable based on how the procedure goes?",

      "Content": "Hello forum....I obviously wish I was making your acquaintance under different circumstances. My father recently passed from PC at age 81 and I was hoping that I would have a while before I personally had to experience this. I am extremely well versed in the treatment protocol and cutting edge blockade therapies in the late stages of advanced PC due to my father's experience. However, I was not made aware of his initial diagnosis and am a relative newbie at the biopsy stage of the diagnosis. I recently saw my urologist and my PSA has risen to 4.8 from 2.5 within the last year. My urologist has retested my PSA and it remained constant at 4.8 which initiated his suggestion of a biopsy. Since I relied so heavily and got so much good advice for my father's treatment here, I wanted to reach out again and ask about the biopsy procedure. The urologist gave no details, possible complications, just scheduled it for a week from now and prescribed some anti-biotic. I am hoping to learn what I should be asking? should I get a 2nd opinion? Is there a less invasive first step here? what are the complications?",
