    "Content": "I have just been diagnosed with prostate cancer. My Gleason scores were 8, in most cases (4+4,4+4, and 3+4). I am trying to determine which method of treatment would be most beneficial with the least amount of side effects and issues. I have spoken with a surgeon about Da Vinci RLP, and will be meeting with a radiation oncologist the end of the week. I would appreciate input from anyone.",
