I do understand the need that a surgeon have the operation experiance but I don't know how to find the right surgeons to ask in the first place. I can't afford to go door to door and inquire about the number of procedures they have performed. I am reading Dr. Walsh's book which I find very good so far and am trying to become as informed as possible about PC and be able to ask the right questions and understand the answers in return.
