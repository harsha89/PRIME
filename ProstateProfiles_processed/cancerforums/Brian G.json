      "Content": "I had da Vinci surgery on Feb. 5 after my PSA reached 13.4 in October 2012 (who knows what it was at by Feb. 5 considering it was a 7 in July 2011). My Dec. 18, 2012 biopsy showed cancer in three of four quadrants (3+3, 3+4, 3+4) but no invasion. There was so much cancer my doctor couldn't spare the nerves on the right side. So anyway, I'm going in March 27 for follow-up 90-day ultra-sensitive PSA. When talking to my doctor pre-surgery, I misspoke and said someone else who had it scored 0.2 post-surgery when I meant 0.02. He said they want to see it at about 0.02. So how low should it be? Should I freak if it is 0.04 or 0.05 or 0.1 or whatever?",

      "Content": "I had robotic prostate cancer surgery in February 2013 to remove 4/3 Gleason score cancer in three quadrants. Now I'm into the PSA test every six months phase. My February test result was 0.02 with the \"less than or equal to\" symbol in front of it. My August test result was simply 0.02. I received a letter from Keith Van Meter (Dr. Ellis was my surgeon) at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance along with my test results and he was very upbeat. He wrote that the low score meant the cancer hadn't returned. However, my local urologist (Dr. Benson in Port Angeles) agreed with me that the test result was odd. So she did a rectal exam (negative) and ordered a followup PSA test for October. Now, I realize that once the PSA level gets below 0.02, the technician really can't measure it. I assume that is why the test result is stated as \"less than or equal to 0.02.\" However, my August PSA test result was stated as simply 0.02. Basic mathematics says that is an increase over the February result. The limits/lower limits of the PSA test may say otherwise.

      "Content": "Chuck, Thanks. I'm getting one ultra-sensitive PSA at six weeks (March 27) and then another at 90 days (May 15) during my follow-up appointment. That's good to know that it might not be all gone (at least according to the test) at six week mark. He just ordered the ultra-sensitive, he didn't say why. But I'm assuming that he wants to see if *anything* is remaining. Since I no longer have a prostate, it should be close to zero, at least at six weeks. I assume that's the reason for the ultra-sensitive test. So far, I'm impotent but the doctor said that should improve within a year given that I'm 46 and had full function beforehand. (I hope I didn't damage the nerves with aggressive masturbation too early.) I'm sure if that's with or without the $124 a month Cialis that I can't afford. I have nerve damage in my left eye so the understand the concept but it's weird seeing something arousing and not getting aroused.",
