    "Content": "I am a 65 YOA guy in Florida who was diagnosed with stage 1 prostate cancer in August 2018.My PSA was 4.55. Had LDBT at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio September 25th 2018. Today just had my first post treatment PSA test done and it came back at 0.36 ng/ml. I am hoping that this is a good sign and it stays low. My MD is a long time family friend and his treatment was excellent. Anyone else have the same experience?",
