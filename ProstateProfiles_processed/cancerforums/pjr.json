      "Content": "Hello All, I'm seeking your advice regarding questions to ask a urologist prior to doing a biopsy. My partner has a biopsy scheduled for early March with a local doctor in town. It's a random biopsy. However, the more I read, the more questions that I have. My husband is 57 years old, PSA = 5.27 (was 6.5 a month earlier), a %FPSA of 14.4, negative DRE. Anyhow, he is going to see the doctor tomorrow, and I have been putting together a list of questions that would be helpful to know prior to doing this biopsy. I'm so new to all this that your thoughts and opinions would be helpful. Below are my questions, so please feel free to tell me which ones aren't good, to add to this, or to suggest different ways to rephrase my questions. Also, for the record -- we're in a college town, but Philly, NY, and Baltimore are about 4 hours or so away. Thank you!! Warmly, pjr ======================================= 1. What do you see as the relative benefit / drawback of doing a random biopsy when it can often yield false negatives over color Doppler or (more importantly) T3 MRI first followed by a biopsy? 2. Do you every do additional tests such as the PHI (prostate health index) test or the MiPs test (Mi Prostate Score \u2013 U. of Michigan)? Why or why not? 3. What record of false-negative biopsies have you seen here in your practice? 4. Who is the pathologist here and what is his/her specialty? 5. We would like to have the slides sent to Dr. Epstein at Johns Hopkins for a second look, regardless of the read. Can we arrange to do this automatically? 6. Should the slides come back negative or with a low Gleason score (e.g., 3+3), how are these cases normally dealt with here? Wouldn\u2019t an MRI prior to this be informative? 7. Since the PSA dropped from 6.5 to 5.27 in a month, should another PSA be taken prior to the biopsy? 8. Should people have a higher Gleason score suggestive of surgery or radiation, where do people typically go for treatment? Who would you recommend? If they seek treatment from a surgeon/radiologist elsewhere, does your office stop treating them? 9. Do you currently have any patients on active surveillance, and if so, how are their cases handled?",

      "Content": "Thanks everybody for the thoughts here. We had the paths re-read by Dr. Epstein, and the findings were basically confirmed. In the previous path, the cores that were 50 and 90% positive for G3+4 noted that the 4 part of the tumor was only 5% of it. We asked Dr. Epstein if that was something that was cause for us to feel positive, and he said yes. Of course, we were hoping for a down-grade on the re-read for the path, but were told by our local uro that when JH re-reads slides, there's typically an upgrade. We were holding our breath for sure, so the general lack of change is good, I think. Prato, let us know what your surgeon says, ok? Also, just curious -- if a path uses the phrase \"discontinuously involving X% of core\" is that of any relevance?",

      "Content": "Hi All, I'm wondering if anyone could enlighten me on how to understand what I think are odd stats that I read on the Johns Hopkins website. I may be missing the obvious, so any thoughts would be helpful! First, in the winter 2014 issue of their \"Prostate Discovery Magazine,\" (article on tweaking the Gleason system) they write: \"In the past, any Gleason pattern 4 tumor was considered aggressive,\" says Epstein. \"But we showed that Gleason score 3+4=7 cancer has a very favorable prognosis, with over 90 percent of men cured after radical prostatectomy.\" http://urology.jhu.edu/newsletter/20...er_2014_19.php Then I look at the Han Table. http://urology.jhu.edu/prostate/han_tables.php Han Table for PSA 4-6; Gleason 3+4; Clinical T1c 3 years after surgery: 3% (1-10) 5 years after surgery: 5% (2-16) 7 years after surgery: 7% (2-23) 10 years after surgery:10% (3-2 Here's the Han Table with data after surgery. Han Table for PSA 4-6; Gleason 3+4; Organ confined 3 years after surgery: 4% (1-10) 5 years after surgery: 6% (2-17) 7 years after surgery: 9% (3-24) 10 years after surgery: 12% (4-29) First, these numbers are pretty consistent with Epstein's quote, but I don't understand the slightly higher percentages given for after surgery if it's known to be organ confined. Then, here's the Han table if it's not organ confined: Han Table for PSA 4-6; Gleason 3+4; Organ confined 3 years after surgery: 12% (5-30) 5 years after surgery: 19% (7-45) 7 years after surgery: 27% (11-59) 10 years after surgery: 34% (14-6 Finally, Partin Table for Clinical T1c; PSA 4-6; Gleason 3+4 lists the probability of organ confined to 66%. http://urology.jhu.edu/prostate/partin_tables.php Maybe I'm splitting hairs here, but I don't understand how people can quote a 90% cure rate for 3+4 when only 66% are predicted to be organ confined; and if it's not organ confined, then there's a 35% chance of recurrence. Can anyone help me understand that? It seems to have pretty important implications in terms of treatment decisions.... Thanks!! Mary",

      "Content": "Hi All, My partner was DX this week, and we we're investigating all options. My question for folks is how they handled traveling for treatment but also having local care? The places we would probably have treatment (probably surgery) would be from 4-5 hours away. I see that people travel all the time, but I'm just now sure how this works. Do you stay in the area until the cath is removed? What about questions like getting drugs, PT, etc., when you're back home? We met with a local urologist yesterday. He was awesome, but just young. He recommended Jonathan Hwang in Washington DC -- 3 hours away (any thoughts on this would be great). But he also said that if we go elsewhere for treatment and there are complications, then he (our local uro) would be unlikely to want to step in because he's just not familiar with what's happening. But for routine things, ok. But I'm just not sure what this means... Can people who have traveled please share their experiences? That would be so helpful. Thank you. With my kind regards, Mary",

      "Content": "Hi All, My partner was DX this week, and we we're investigating all options. My question for folks is how they handled traveling for treatment but also having local care? The places we would probably have treatment (probably surgery) would be from 4-5 hours away. I see that people travel all the time, but I'm just now sure how this works. Do you stay in the area until the cath is removed? What about questions like getting drugs, PT, etc., when you're back home? We met with a local urologist yesterday. He was awesome, but just young. He recommended Jonathan Hwang in Washington DC -- 3 hours away (any thoughts on this would be great). But he also said that if we go elsewhere for treatment and there are complications, then he (our local uro) would be unlikely to want to step in because he's just not familiar with what's happening. But for routine things, ok. But I'm just not sure what this means... Can people who have traveled please share their experiences? That would be so helpful. Thank you. With my kind regards, Mary",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, Sorry for the cross-postings... I've posted a couple of times as a concerned spouse, but thought I would post a new thread here as the wife of a newly official member of the club. Here is the path as far as I understand it, so your take on things and our plan would be great. The collective wisdom here is awesome. Age 57; Health excellent (weight, exercise, etc.) PSA 5.27; %fPSA 14.4 8/20 cores % Gleason: 3+4 Clinical State: T1c Pathologic Stage: T2c -There was a lot of variation regarding % involvement within each core: 5% 5% 10% 50% 50% 60% 80% 90% -All of the cores except 1 were Gleason 6 (3 + 3). -There was a note saying: The Gleason grade 4 component involves approximately 5% of the tumor. The total volume of the prostate is small: 19.5 Right now we have requested a second read with Dr. Epstein. Sooooo... we have a scheduled appointment for a day-long clinic at John's Hopkins on April 3rd. Right now my partner is considering RALP or Brachy. Both Dr. Alluf and Dr. Song will be there, and we are told that they're generally scheduling out about 3-4 weeks (so early May). Any thoughts? Is this putting things off too long? Should we have more consults? Do they seem like good choices? Pretty tough day here. Thanks to everyone for the collected wisdom. Best, pjr (real name is Mary)",

      "Content": "Hi All, My husband and I just pulled into Baltimore about an hour ago to go to the all-day clinic tomorrow at Johns Hopkins for newly diagnosed folks. At the clinic, both a surgeon (Dr. Allaf) and a radiologist (Dr. Song) will be consulting with us together after reviewing everything. It seems like a good idea to have both of them in the room. So... with both of them there, and there any unique questions that you would ask? We seem to be getting contradictory advice depending on if we're talking to a surgeon vs. a radiologist.

      "Content": "Hi All, Thanks for all of the suggestions. Dr. Allaf was great. He was very patient and clear in talking with us. He suggested surgery, of course, but was very reasoned about why, and encouraging that we consider everything. He seemed optimistic and was assuring. I was super impressed with him. He said they don't do paths on sections during the operation -- that it isn't helpful he said. In terms of margins, he said that although they, of course, go for negative margins, having a small margin doesn't mean that a recurrence is going to happen for sure. Our meeting with the radiologist wasn't quite as assuring. When he came in he said that because of the # of positive cores ( and the percent involvement in some of them (up to 90%), even though my husband is 3+4, he considers him unfavorable intermediate risk. Up until this point, every doctor we talked with has characterized my husband as favorable intermediate risk. When we asked if it mattered that the biopsy took 20 (rather than 12) cores, he was surprised and corrected himself a little, but not too much. He was kind of reading the paper as we sat there. When we asked if it mattered that the path report noted that the \"4\" part of the 3+4 represented only 5% of the tumor, he said maybe. He just wasn't all that encouraging on the radiation front. I guest that's about the sum total. Overall, it was a good experience. I look forward to getting their written notes tomorrow or Tuesday.

At the clinic, both a surgeon (Dr. Allaf) and a radiologist (Dr. Song) will be consulting with us together after reviewing everything. It seems like a good idea to have both of them in the room. So... with both of them there, and there any unique questions that you would ask? We seem to be getting contradictory advice depending on if we're talking to a surgeon vs. a radiologist.

      "Content": "Hi All, Thanks so much for the responses. Very helpful. We haven't heard back from MSKCC's re-read of the MRI slides, but we did ask Dr. Epstein his opinion on the upgrade re: the biopsy path. He basically said that the 2 new cores read as 3+4 he saw as 3+3. He also said that they lumped three cores in a given area together as 3+4, but he read the cores separately. Not sure that this makes too much difference, really. A lot of it has to come down to an almost aesthetic judgment call. But having Dr. Zelefsky walk in the room and say \"You don't have two 3+4 cores, you have four\" was really kind of a bummer. Hanging on every shred of optimism here! Have a great weekend everyone, Mary",

      "Content": "Hi All, Thanks much for the fine advice, as always. Right now, all options are still under consideration. However, Dr. Pinto is running a trial for the use of a vaccine prior to surgery to lower the likelihood of recurrence. I'm a (3x) melanoma survivor, so I keenly watch research on immunotherapy, for sure. That's why this trial really caught my eye. But being in the trial necessitates that surgery is done there, by Dr. Pinto. I just don't know much about his track record re: surgery. I think he has done a ton of them, but I don't know much about his technique, side effects, % of positive surgical margins, etc. I think I'm more interested in this trial than my husband is, but if we continue to get more info about trial, I'm happy to share this information.

      "Content": "Hi All, So we went to NY this weekend to see Zelefsky at Sloan Kettering and Teweri at Mt. Sinai. Here was the BUMMER news. The path from MSKCC went from 2 cores of 3+4 (read by Epstein) to 4 cores read by MSKCC. Also, Dr. Zelefsky is having a radiologist there look at the MRI slides from Upenn again. Although Upenn read them as showing all organ confined, Zelefsky read them as suggesting that they may be breaching the prostate wall. So.... choices: Brachy with a 5-day (over 2 weeks) Hypofractionated boost with Dr. Zelefsky...? Or surgery with Dr. Tewari....? Or maybe this clinical trial? As a cancer survivor, I watch clinical trials a lot and beginning to think that immunatherapy is a real thing. This is for people prior to going for surgery to try to minimize recurrence. It would delay treatment though... https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/s...-C-0112&rank=1 I'm just flat-out overwhelmed with information.

      "Content": "Hello All, I'm a newbie here and am a concerned partner. Thank you so much for this forum!!! My 57-year old husband had a PSA in early Jan of 6.5. His only other prior PSA (four years ago) was 2.75. I asked him to do another PSA last week, and it came back lower, 5.27, but his %free was 14.4. (Free PSA wasn't measured the first time) My concern is that his biopsy isn't scheduled until March 5th. This %free is really worrying me, as I keep reading that it's an indicator of more aggressive types. We just learned that his dad had pc, but it's really weird -- my husband didn't know it, and his siblings have only vague memories (e.g., it was over 20 years ago, he didn't do anything about it, no surgery, lived to be 89 years old, etc.). I'm just wondering if I should push to have the biopsy sooner because of this %free issue? Or a more sensitive biopsy? Also, should he have another PSA right before the biopsy? I'm not sure why his PSA would drop so much, and if it would have dropped further, the %free would have been above the magic 15% number. Wooo.. lots of questions. I'm a survivor of cervical cancer and of melanoma, so I guess I'm trigger happy. !! Thanks SO MUCH for any advice or insights! Warmly, pjr",

      "Content": "Hello Again All, I just can't seem to stop reading and reading, so here I am asking for your thoughts again... So my husband has 8/20 positives identified; 6 were 3+3 and 2 were 3+4. However, now when reviewing his path, here's what has me concerned: 5 of the positive cores were in the left and right apex. Three in the left were 3+3 at 5%; 10% and 60%. Two in the right were 3+4 with 50% and 90%. Path note says that the portion of 4 in the 3+4 was about 5% (I guess that's a ray of hope there). The other thing I read is that smaller prostate volume is associated both with higher surgical margins and higher recurrence. He has a small total volume = 17.3. I'm trying not to flip, but OMG, worried. We have a day-long clinic scheduled at Johns Hopkins on April 3 where both a radiologist and a surgeon will be there. Prior to that we have a consult with a surgeon at UPenn. I'm just wondering if the location, volume, size of prostate, etc., should be cause for rethinking strategy here. Thank you!!!! Warmly, Mary",
