I usually walk 2 mile three or four days a week and that seems to keep it from swelling. I'm 73 now and restarted golfing last year an recently started riding my bike and not walking. My leg started swelling again. It seems that biking doesn't do the job for me. I guess I need to start walking again. It does tire me a lot but it's better than having the swelling. My swelling usually goes down at night but begins first thing in the morning after standing a while.",
