I found my self looking forward to the surgery to get it behind me. Think of it that way and you may find it easier in the few days ahead. This forum really helped me to understand what was about to happen and on the other side. I have always had a pretty high tolerance for pain so the surgery pain did not overwhelm me and it is certainly tolerable. The one thing that got to me right out of the gate and was the most unpleasant part of the whole ordeal was the catheter. Make friends with it right from the get-go and you will be fine. Take a steady diet of stool softener like Metamucil until your first BM and things will go smoothly! (Pun intended) Good luck and see you on the other side. Fran",

With a negative DRE and marginally high PSA that has fluctuated down considerably, your uro is not very confident in finding any cancer.

      "Content": "Welcome Brock, sorry you had to join our little club. You have come to a great place for insight and advice. Most here who have been through the surgery will tell you that you will feel remarkably better as the days and weeks go by. Take it slow, walk when you can to get and keep things moving, keep doing those Kegels and stay positive. You will undoubtedly get frustrated when you start to feel really good but your incontinence or ED issue don't seem to be progressing. Be patient as it takes much time for your body to recover from this ordeal. Good luck! Fran",

As Chuck so often tells people, the biopsy only samples about 1/1000th of the prostate so in your case, there is likely a lot going on and of an aggressive nature. You are wise to seek treatment relatively quickly. Do your research, pick a treatment that is best for you and don't look back. Many of us here were lucky enough to find our cancer early and have become members of our Zero Club. Here's hoping you get to join that club as well. Good luck and stay positive! Fran",

As Chuck so often tells people, the biopsy only samples about 1/1000th of the prostate so in your case, there is likely a lot going on and of an aggressive nature. You are wise to seek treatment relatively quickly. Do your research, pick a treatment that is best for you and don't look back. Many of us here were lucky enough to find our cancer early and have become members of our Zero Club. Here's hoping you get to join that club as well. Good luck and stay positive! Fran",

With a negative DRE and marginally high PSA that has fluctuated down considerably, your uro is not very confident in finding any cancer.

Your urologist will use it along with it's trend and rate of change (sometimes referred to as doubling time) along with DRE's to try to gauge what is going on. Trust your doctor (or if you don't, find one you do) and retest in January along with another DRE (after the blood draw) and go from there. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome, Popi. You will get some excellent insight and advice here. Did you have a DRE (digital rectal exam) as part of your urologist visit? If you did I would guess it did not show anything out of the ordinary. If it had been abnormal, your urologist would probably have recommended a biopsy as the next step. I would not worry too much about your psa numbers. You are right that sex, bike riding, exercise, etc. can spike your psa. Keep an eye on it and continue to have dre's looking for abnormalities. As far as your surgeon, most here recommend that you find one that has done at least 500 daVinci prostatectemies. As Highlander, an administrator here who is sure to chime in, likes to say, you only get one shot at this! Many of us here felt the same way as you. When cancer was found remove it as soon possible! Good luck, stay positive, and we all hope you don't have to join our club. Or if you do, not any time soon. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome to the club, Peter! You are right that this forum helps many through this ordeal. I often see many signed on to the forum, but few posters and often wondered who was lurking and getting help by just reading. You will find that you will make great strides in the months to come. I am coming up on 5 months post surgery and it's almost like it never happened. LOL You will get frustrated at times as your mind thinks you should be doing better than you are, but take it slow and easy as the trauma of the surgery takes more out of you than you think! Good luck, stay positive, and here's hoping you join the Zero Club that Highlander speaks of! Fran",

That is said not to scare you but to point out the vagaries of the disease and it's diagnosis and treatment. It is a somewhat inaccurate science. It is what leads some of us to choose surgery...to hopefully cut it out and remove all traces from the body. Sometimes it works and other times it doesn't. Good luck in your research and treatment choice. We are all here for you. Fran",

Like Chuck, I had severe BPH which eventually turned into cancer and after daVinci surgery, I am cancer free and peeing like a racehorse . Most comments above are spot on. In addition, I would add that I was on Avodart for a number of years and had no adverse side affects. In addition, there is a procedure to essentially Rotorooter your urethra, which will open up the passage where the prostate is squeezing it shut. That may be in your future. It seems to me that 15 years is an awful long time to have BPH, so like the others I am interested to know your age. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Walt_Green not to pic nits here, but the OP did Watchful Wait, not Active Surveillance. there is a very big difference! Unless I read it incorrectly, he went 2 years (perhaps 3?) in between biopsies, and only had PSA's every 6 months. IIRC, AS requires yearly biopsies as well as PSA tests every three months. As for the OP, I would recommend a he get second opinion on the G8 scoring. His PSA is *extremely* low for his age. Even if scaled back to a G7a or 7b, he should still treat, of course. But, there's a world of difference between G7a/b or G8. For those quick to criticize WW/AS, the OP has had three years of normal life. His scans are negative. Even if he has to treat now, he's LOST NOTHING. on the other hand, he has gained THREE YEARS OF NORMAL LIFE. Given his age, his WW was a smart play. He's lost nothing, only gained. I don't give a lot of weight to negative scans. It has been said many times here that the scans don't show anything unless any tumor is large. There still could micrometastisis that no scan will detect. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome, Gurley 43. Sorry you are joining the club. You will get great insight and support here. I had similar psa numbers when my cancer was detected this past May. At 62 and with excellent health my choice was surgery and having found it early, I'm confident that I am now and will remain cancer free. Only time will tell. I'm not sure I would make the same treatment choice if I had been 70, but I'm pretty sure I would. Gleason 8 is pretty aggressive so whatever you decide, you should move quickly. I had a good friend who had the seeds implanted at 70. He was not in as good physical condition as I and I'm not sure of his Gleason score or psa but he has done well for 5 years now. There are lots of options. If you haven't already, get a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book Surviving Prostate Cancer. It is one of the bibles on the subject. Others will likely chime in with more advice. Good luck Fran",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Walt_Green not to pic nits here, but the OP did Watchful Wait, not Active Surveillance. there is a very big difference! Unless I read it incorrectly, he went 2 years (perhaps 3?) in between biopsies, and only had PSA's every 6 months. IIRC, AS requires yearly biopsies as well as PSA tests every three months. As for the OP, I would recommend a he get second opinion on the G8 scoring. His PSA is *extremely* low for his age. Even if scaled back to a G7a or 7b, he should still treat, of course. But, there's a world of difference between G7a/b or G8. For those quick to criticize WW/AS, the OP has had three years of normal life. His scans are negative. Even if he has to treat now, he's LOST NOTHING. on the other hand, he has gained THREE YEARS OF NORMAL LIFE. Given his age, his WW was a smart play. He's lost nothing, only gained. I don't give a lot of weight to negative scans. It has been said many times here that the scans don't show anything unless any tumor is large. There still could micrometastisis that no scan will detect. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome, Gurley 43. Sorry you are joining the club. You will get great insight and support here. I had similar psa numbers when my cancer was detected this past May. At 62 and with excellent health my choice was surgery and having found it early, I'm confident that I am now and will remain cancer free. Only time will tell. I'm not sure I would make the same treatment choice if I had been 70, but I'm pretty sure I would. Gleason 8 is pretty aggressive so whatever you decide, you should move quickly. I had a good friend who had the seeds implanted at 70. He was not in as good physical condition as I and I'm not sure of his Gleason score or psa but he has done well for 5 years now. There are lots of options. If you haven't already, get a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book Surviving Prostate Cancer. It is one of the bibles on the subject. Others will likely chime in with more advice. Good luck Fran",

After catheter removal, you'll be able to drive and you' ll start to feel like your old self. It drags at first, but soon time will be flying by. I'm over 6 months post op now and it's almost like it never happened! Good luck in joining our Zero Club and stay positive! Fran",

And I was lucky enough ?? to have it in for 12 days as that is my doctors typical protocol! I just used loose fitting shorts (it was the summer) and sweat pants and let the tube run inside the waist band and then down. My nurse daughter-in-law hooked me up with some velcro sticky pads specially made for the catheter tube and they worked great. Good luck with catheter removal tomorrow, guys. Piece of cake! Bring a pair of pad briefs with you as most have little control right after removal. Fran",

      "Content": "Bill, I had my 6 week follow up visit with my urologist today. He said I was doing great and to just keep doing Kegels. He prescribed a drug for helping with bladder control. I was also surprised to learn that some of the sutures that he used to tie the bladder to the urethra probably have not dissolved yet so as that happens, expect more and more control....interesting. I also realized later that I avoided coffee altogether today(quite by accident) so that helped play a role in me staying dry this morning. Fran",

Definitely get a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book Surviving Prostate Cancer. It is considered one of the bibles on the subject. Otago is correct that psa is not a reliable predictor of pca in and of itself. You will see below my psa at cancer diagnosis was 2.9. And although the needle biopsy finds cancer when it exists most of the time when present, it can miss it. MRI and scans usually are done after because they are less accurate in finding minute amounts of cancer. It is a combination of all of these tests including the DRE that give the urologist the overall picture of what is going on.

I choose daVinci surgery and just had my 5 year PSA showing 0 and still cancer free. My Gleason score was 7 and biopsy found it on one lobe only. Funny thing is final pathology showed both lobes involved so biopsies can miss cancer as they are sampling such a minute amount of tissue. Not to alarm you, but in the same vain, a very good friend at 53 years old that had virtually the same stats as I going into surgery had G9 cancer that had spread and he is going through radiation now. Get all your tests and with a urologist you trust, make an informed decision on your treatment, which could include active surveillance. Good luck and keep us up to date on your progress. Fran",

Otago is correct that psa is not a reliable predictor of pca in and of itself. You will see below my psa at cancer diagnosis was 2.9. And although the needle biopsy finds cancer when it exists most of the time when present, it can miss it. MRI and scans usually are done after because they are less accurate in finding minute amounts of cancer.

I am still struggling to gain bladder control after one week post catheter, but I must admit there is slight improvement every day. I am hoping it continues to improve. Good luck on our PSA testing as we move forward....may it remain undetectable for years to come! Fran",

Fairwind is correct in stating 300 surgeries is a minimum base line for a surgeon to be considered experienced. Obviously, more surgeries, more experienced but you could also look at your particular surgeons results concerning complications and speak to some of his patients if allowed. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

Like you, we found my cancer very early and I am and should remain cancer free. Slight incontinence persists but is improving and ED is still a major issue, but I had issues before surgery from BPH and being 63, it is to be expected. I feel great and am in a good place physically as well as emotionally. I have tremendous support from my family and co-workers and this forum was also invaluable in helping me through the ordeal.

Like you, we found my cancer very early and I am and should remain cancer free. Slight incontinence persists but is improving and ED is still a major issue, but I had issues before surgery from BPH and being 63, it is to be expected. I feel great and am in a good place physically as well as emotionally. I have tremendous support from my family and co-workers and this forum was also invaluable in helping me through the ordeal.

No two PCa cases are the same which doesn't make it any easier to decide on a treatment. Put all your husband's history and stats into his signature and it will show up each time you post. That way responders can see his info at a glance each time they answer. Good luck in your search for answers. Fran",

If you are like most of us, you will leak heavily at first, then less and less quickly until recovery starts to slow. You may then get frustrated that it is not going as quickly as you think it should. Be patient...it was almost a year to the day that I was able to not use any protection at all. It is major surgery with major reconstruction to your plumbing! It takes time to heal. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

I wonder by taking everything that included the nerves that control erections? I am coming up on 9 weeks post surgery. I did not have any of the testicle pain your dad suffers from but have heard it mentioned here. I have never seen the foot pain described here but that doesn't mean it hasn't as I'm pretty new to this club. Others will certainly chime in. I would expect that your dad, much like I have, will be recovered very quickly and pretty much back to his old hard working self. Other than slow recovery in the incontinence department, and still waiting for the ED issue to come around, I feel 100% and am doing everything I did before surgery. Good luck to your dad and congrats to you for looking for answers for him. Fran",

I always thought that my G7 diagnosis made surgery an easy choice and wondered what I might have done had it been G6. In your case, with your family history, you too don't have to second guess before the surgery and have many years to enjoy ahead of you. Be patient...you had major surgery with major plumbing reconstruction and the healing is a long slow process. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

I wonder by taking everything that included the nerves that control erections? I am coming up on 9 weeks post surgery. I did not have any of the testicle pain your dad suffers from but have heard it mentioned here. I have never seen the foot pain described here but that doesn't mean it hasn't as I'm pretty new to this club. Others will certainly chime in. I would expect that your dad, much like I have, will be recovered very quickly and pretty much back to his old hard working self. Other than slow recovery in the incontinence department, and still waiting for the ED issue to come around, I feel 100% and am doing everything I did before surgery. Good luck to your dad and congrats to you for looking for answers for him. Fran",

If surgery ends up your plan of action, it will not occur until 6-8 weeks after your biopsy to allow for that to heal. There is life after Prostate surgery, so take heart in that fact. In addition, consider yourself lucky not to have G7,8, or 9 Cancer which is more aggressive than your diagnosed G6. When giving more details of your history, kindly give your age as well. Good luck and stay positive! Fran",

      "Content": "Enzo, if you learn anything anything along the way, it will be that no two prostate cancers are the same. A very high PSA doesn't necessarily mean cancer and a low PSA doesn't mean there is no cancer. A combination of tests of PSA , DRE, and a needle biopsy are used to determine a cancerous prostate and even then, the most definitive test, the biopsy, can occasionally miss the cancer. The combination of the PSA and DRE are used by the doctor to determine if a biopsy is needed and to establish a baseline of you prostate condition. See what your PSA number is and then see what your doctor says. Fran",

Our hospital was also only 10 minutes away. By the way, unless something bad happens, he would have no issue with oxygen. He will be intibated for the surgery, which means he will have oxygen pumped directly to his lungs through a tube down his throat. Afterwards, he will not even know it happened save for a raspy throat possibly. Fran",

I trusted his judgement and although it took three to find my cancer, I consider it the reason my G7 cancer was found early and after surgery, I am cancer free. (Hoping to stay that way). Although PSA is also an obvious trigger for a biopsy, in my case Avodart was doing a good job at keeping my PSA low (2.9 at surgery). As has been said many times, every case is different so knowledge and trust in your doctor are certainly key factors in your decision. Good luck. Fran",

When I got up in the middle of the night, I would actually have to squeeze my penis to keep from leaking as I hustled to the bathroom. Don't worry as control comes back slowly but surely! Today after 7 months post op, I wear a light pad during the day for that occasional leak from sneezing or coughing and pad free at night. Keep doing those Kegels! Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

You always have salvage radiation as a backup if you need it, but not the other way around. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome to the forum, Gearloose. Sorry to hear of your story, but I am glad you told it. There are many here who find themselves in the same predicament you were in with Gleason 6 cancer diagnosed and not knowing whether AS is a good option for them. Unfortunately, everyone's cancer is different so it is such a roll of the dice to not treat. I was lucky enough (if you can call it lucky) to have G7 cancer which made my choice a lot easier. I had been on Avodart for years and it had shrunk my prostate too, but my urologist was sharp enough to continue to biopsy looking for PCa even though my PSA was 2.9. We found it on the third try and was lucky enough to find it early. Out it came and hopefully I remain cancer free. Good luck with your continued treatment and stay positive. Fran",

That would give you plenty of time to prepare yourself both mentally and physically for the ordeal. If at all possible, I would try to pick a surgeon and get a date for surgery, so you don't have to wait once you get up north. There are too many G6's that are upgraded after surgery. At 59, you have many years ahead of you. In my mind, you are making the right decision. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

When it inevitably became impossible I felt a little old and bummed until one day I read a story in Runners World about Frank Shorter and how he was happy with running 10 minute miles at his age. If he can be happy at that pace, then so could I. Kick ass and take names! Fran",

It seems to me that infection has been ruled out as a cause of your abnormally high PSA numbers. The fluctuations from month to month can be possibly caused by anything you may have done to aggravate your prostate including sex or bicycling or any number of things prior to your blood draw. In any case your doctor is right in suggesting a biopsy to determine if any cancer exists. I would not hesitate further in having the procedure. There is very little pain and discomfort involved and the results are critical in determining your next move. PCa found early gives you the most options for treatment and the best chance at a cure.

At your age you stand a great chance of being cured and are young enough to tolerate the surgery with little difficulty. I am 4 months post daVinci and expect to get my second undetectable PSA in a couple of weeks. I am back to normal with mild incontinence and ED issues I hope improve as time moves on. Many will chime in with questions to ask your surgeon but experience is probably the key one. Most would say close to one thousand surgeries experience or more would be good.

      "Content": "Welcome boeinguy! You have come to a great place for insight and advice. It looks like you are a good candidate for active surveillance, what we call AS around here. The key is to watch it closely enough so that you catch it and treat it in time to prevent any cancer from spreading outside the prostate. The good news is Gleason 6 cancer is considered very slow growing and much less aggressive than the G7's,8's and 9's. So that means it could be some years before treatment is warranted, if at all. It should be noted, however, that even with 2-12 core biopsies, cancer could still have been missed. My G7 was found in one of 14 cores on one side but final pathology showed it on both sides. Others will chime in with their take on your situation. In the mean time, read some of the threads on this site to get an idea of the different pca situations that we are all dealing with. In addition, get a copy of Dr. Walsh's book Surviving Prostate Cancer. It is considered one of the bibles on the subject. If you have questions, fire away as there are many here who would be happy to help. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

I am over 9 weeks post daVinci and still struggling with incontinence but it is much better than where you are now. I was extremely frustrated at three weeks post surgery but that frustration wains as time goes on. You get a little better and a little used to it. I have serious ED so in that regard you are ahead of me! Everyone heals and recovers differently. All I can say is keep doing those Kegels and try to be patient. I find now that if I sit for a long period and overfill my bladder, I have to Kegel all the way to the John to make it without filling my pad. I am down to two pads during the day and one overnight that stays pretty dry. The more active I am, the less control I have but better as the weeks go on.

      "Content": "Welcome to our club Kargok9. Highlander and Otago bring up some good points. The decision on treatment is different for everyone as every single case is different. It has so much to do with age, physical condition, Gleason score, psa, life expectancy, DRE findings, prior urinary and ED issues, and on and on. You have to analyze all these, make a decision and don't look back. In your case, I don't think I would stay on AS for long. Both surgery and Brachy are good options for you. I would decide on one and hopefully put this pca thing behind you so can continue doing what you love for many years to come. Good luck and stay positive. Fran P.S.- I am curious to know if you would be following this same course if you had a confirmed G7 pc??",

It has so much to do with age, physical condition, Gleason score, psa, life expectancy, DRE findings, prior urinary and ED issues, and on and on. You have to analyze all these, make a decision and don't look back. In your case, I don't think I would stay on AS for long. Both surgery and Brachy are good options for you. I would decide on one and hopefully put this pca thing behind you so can continue doing what you love for many years to come. Good luck and stay positive.

      "Content": "Welcome to the club. You have many friends here who have and are struggling with different issues just like you. You will get great insight and help here. I am over 9 weeks post daVinci and still struggling with incontinence but it is much better than where you are now. I was extremely frustrated at three weeks post surgery but that frustration wains as time goes on. You get a little better and a little used to it. I have serious ED so in that regard you are ahead of me! Everyone heals and recovers differently. All I can say is keep doing those Kegels and try to be patient. I find now that if I sit for a long period and overfill my bladder, I have to Kegel all the way to the John to make it without filling my pad. I am down to two pads during the day and one overnight that stays pretty dry. The more active I am, the less control I have but better as the weeks go on. As far as your signature goes, go to your profile page , click on forum actions at top and click on edit profile, and look for edit signature over in the left column. If you click on that it will allow you to enter info that will show up on all your posts. Good luck and stay positive! Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome. Sorry your dad is joining. I am guessing you got the numbers backwards PSA of 4.2 and Gleason score of 6. I am surprised at treatment so soon, if in fact he was just diagnosed. In addition Gleason 6 cancer is not considered aggressive so that is good and PSA of 4.2 is only barely marginally high. I would suggest getting a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book, Surviving Prostate Cancer, which many consider one of the bibles on the subject. If everything is as you have described, your dad has a good chance his treatment will be successful. Try not to worry and keep us informed. Good luck, Fran",

I had three biopsies over 4 years driven by rising PSA and DRE results and it wasn't until the third that a small amount of cancer was found. I had been troubled by BPH for some years before that. You are wise, with your family history, to stay on top of your Prostate health. Try not to worry too much and know that you are doing everything that you possibly can and if you end up with a pc diagnosis at some point, it will be early enough that a cure will certainly be attainable.

      "Content": "Welcome to our club Kargok9. Highlander and Otago bring up some good points. The decision on treatment is different for everyone as every single case is different. It has so much to do with age, physical condition, Gleason score, psa, life expectancy, DRE findings, prior urinary and ED issues, and on and on. You have to analyze all these, make a decision and don't look back. In your case, I don't think I would stay on AS for long. Both surgery and Brachy are good options for you. I would decide on one and hopefully put this pca thing behind you so can continue doing what you love for many years to come. Good luck and stay positive. Fran P.S.- I am curious to know if you would be following this same course if you had a confirmed G7 pc??",

Read up on the stickies and older posts and you might get a sense of what your dad and his family are in for. Hopefully they have caught this early and with the correct treatment he will become cancer free. It would benefit you both to pick up a copy of Dr. Walsh's book \"Surviving Prostate Cancer\". It is considered one of the bibles on the subject. Stay tuned as many more will chime in with advice and words of encouragement. Good luck and stay positive.

      "Content": "The PSA is only one of the tools used to help evaluate for PC. The DRE is is a very important one. And the biopsy, of course, is more important still. All, however, have their limitations and drawbacks. It is the judgement and skill of the urologist to evaluate all these to determine what is actually going that is key. All cases are different, so it is hard to put yours or anyone's in with others that are exactly the same...there are none. In my case, my urologist used the changing DRE over a number of years to schedule three biopsies, the third one finding G7 cancer. Because he was paying attention, we found it early enough and after daVinci surgery I am, and hope to remain, cancer free. I say, find a urologist you trust and are comfortable with. Research PC and how it relates to your situation. Eventually, if necessary, chose a course of treatment and don't look back. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome to the forum. Yes, there is a good chance it is nothing serious at this time. I had three biopsies over 4 years driven by rising PSA and DRE results and it wasn't until the third that a small amount of cancer was found. I had been troubled by BPH for some years before that. You are wise, with your family history, to stay on top of your Prostate health. Try not to worry too much and know that you are doing everything that you possibly can and if you end up with a pc diagnosis at some point, it will be early enough that a cure will certainly be attainable.

      "Content": "All giving great advice. I would add that your husband's bottom will be sore for some days. Most find that sitting in a reclined position, whether in the car or at home takes pressure off this area and is much more comfortable. I found the catheter to be the biggest challenge of the whole ordeal. Tough to get comfortable for sleeping but he will get used to it. I was lucky enough to have mine in for 12 days and found the leg bag not worth the trouble and stuck with the large bag for the majority of that time. First bowel movement, first shower, and catheter removal are big milestones that were like religious experiences for me. After that, the slow healing process. Tell him to not get frustrated, it is a long haul. Good luck and stay positive. Two years now since my surgery and it's like it never happened! Fran",

      "Content": "Fairwind, he states near the end of the first paragraph that he just made 50. My two cents is, put less stock in the psa number (mine was 2.9 at surgery) and more stock in the biopsy and other scans. You obviously have a tumor that is growing. I would seek treatment as soon as possible. Of course mine was gleason 7 but either way, it is not getting better without some form of treatment and at 50, you have a lot of good years left if treated successfully. That's my take. Others may disagree. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

For the time being I would concentrate on the next six to eight weeks of healing and then see where his psa stands. As Prato said, there is life after daVinci surgery but the healing process is not linear and can be frustrating at times. Although I too was playing golf at 8 weeks post surgery, I was soaking a pad after 9 holes. It took me a year to the day to throw them out and go pad free. Now it's like it never happened!

You are lucky or unlucky, depending on how you look at it, to have G6 cancer. My G7 made my decision for treatment far easier! I am here to tell you, though, that if you decide on surgery, you will be back to work in virtually no time. I went back to work 1/2 days after 3 weeks and was back full time at about 5. The surgery kicks the stuffing out of you, no question, but you will recover. I am 1 1/2 years post daVinci now and it's almost like it never happened. No decision you make will be wrong, as no matter what you decide, it is right for you! Good luck and stay positive! Fran",

Always having a spare pad for the just in case. etc., etc. What helped me was staying busy and not dwelling on the issues.

Someone on the site recommended asking for a prescription for a numbing cream to use on the tip of the penis before I was discharged and I made sure I got it and I feel that helped immensely! I also found that the attachment of the tube to the thigh was critical for comfort. A relative who is a nurse hooked me up with a velcro device that is specially made for this and it also helped position the tube perfectly and keep it there during movement and allowed quick disconnect for bag emptying and cleaning. Tell him to hang in there and the catheter will be out before he knows it and he will be on his way to a full recovery. Most on here will tell you that soon he will find it's almost like it never happened. Good luck, Fran",

If you can, pick up a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book Surviving Prostate Cancer. It is considered one of the bibles on the subject and may shed some insight into what your father faces. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

Someone on the site recommended asking for a prescription for a numbing cream to use on the tip of the penis before I was discharged and I made sure I got it and I feel that helped immensely! I also found that the attachment of the tube to the thigh was critical for comfort. A relative who is a nurse hooked me up with a velcro device that is specially made for this and it also helped position the tube perfectly and keep it there during movement and allowed quick disconnect for bag emptying and cleaning. Tell him to hang in there and the catheter will be out before he knows it and he will be on his way to a full recovery. Most on here will tell you that soon he will find it's almost like it never happened. Good luck, Fran",

      "Content": "Congratulations Ralph. Just passed my one year 7/17 and am also thankful to continue to be in the Zero Club. It also marks the time where I would consider myself fully continent. I just stopped using any leakage pads and have continued to be leak free for a couple of weeks no matter what my activity. In addition, there seems to be a little stirring in the ED department, so I am still hopeful for continued improvement. Continued success! Fran",

You tend to feel much better pretty quickly and your mind says you are in better shape than you really are. I went back to work 1/2 days at about three and a half weeks and when I got home at lunch I had to take a pretty good nap! It took me two or three weeks of that before I was able to go full time and then it was off to bed after dinner. It was months, not weeks, until I felt back to my pre surgery stamina. Take it slow and easy and listen to your body closely! Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome to our site and here's hoping you don't get to join our little club! We have all been through what you are going through. You are wise to be vigilant with your PSA and I would have done the biopsy as well. It's the only way so far to know definitively whether you have pc or not and if you do, how aggressive it may be. As you research you will come to know that no two cases of pc are alike. In addition cases can range from high PSA with low Gleason score cancer to high PSA cases with low G scores and everything in between. Besides urinary issues, do you suffer from ED issues as well? Many of us with enlarged prostates were struggling with ED prior to surgery and that continues after treatment. Those with smaller prostate's that had less ED issues seem to have a better outcome with sexual function after surgery. Good luck and stay positive no matter what. Be sure to let us know how you make out. Fran",

I was hoping the injections would accelerate any nerve healing still going on and I must say, there is improvement...we will just have to wait and see. I am with you, it ain't over till its over!

You are right that sex or anything else that tweaks your prostate will affect the psa number. How much is another question but either way the amount of increase against the amount of time between tests is a bigger marker. I would not hesitate in getting the biopsy done and see where you stand asap. There is very little chance of infection and early detection is key. You will find through your research that no two pca cases are the same. Low psa cases can have lots of cancer and high psa cases can have none. It took a third biopsy over 5 years in my case to find mine and my psa was 2.9 at diagnosis. I chose surgery because I was convinced we found it early and as of now, consider myself cancer free. I am hoping that continues as I have my psa tested for the next 5 years. Others will chime here with more advice but I expect most will say have that biopsy. Good luck. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome to our site and here's hoping you don't get to join our little club! We have all been through what you are going through. You are wise to be vigilant with your PSA and I would have done the biopsy as well. It's the only way so far to know definitively whether you have pc or not and if you do, how aggressive it may be. As you research you will come to know that no two cases of pc are alike. In addition cases can range from high PSA with low Gleason score cancer to high PSA cases with low G scores and everything in between. Besides urinary issues, do you suffer from ED issues as well? Many of us with enlarged prostates were struggling with ED prior to surgery and that continues after treatment. Those with smaller prostate's that had less ED issues seem to have a better outcome with sexual function after surgery. Good luck and stay positive no matter what. Be sure to let us know how you make out. Fran",

Much depends on your age, physical health, mindset and many other factors. As you can see in my signature, I was 62 when diagnosed with a PSA of 2.9 but ended up with G7 in both lobes after surgical pathology. I am hoping because of early detection, we got it all out and I will remain cancer free. We'll see. Read a bunch of the threads on this forum for a wealth of info. Also pick up a copy of Dr. Walsh's book Surviving Prostate Cancer as it is considered one of the bibles on the subject. Stay tuned as many more will weigh in.

Much depends on your age, physical health, mindset and many other factors. As you can see in my signature, I was 62 when diagnosed with a PSA of 2.9 but ended up with G7 in both lobes after surgical pathology. I am hoping because of early detection, we got it all out and I will remain cancer free. We'll see. Read a bunch of the threads on this forum for a wealth of info. Also pick up a copy of Dr. Walsh's book Surviving Prostate Cancer as it is considered one of the bibles on the subject. Stay tuned as many more will weigh in. Give us your age and as many of your stats and history as you can. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

      "Content": "Interesting Bill! The obvious question, I suppose, is because the Gleason score can routinely be higher in post surgery pathology, could the Gleason 6 originally diagnosed really have been a 7? In my case, the initial biopsy showed one side involved but the final pathology showed both sides with cancer. I had initially decided to probably wait till this fall to have the surgery, but my urologist convinced me to act more quickly and take advantage of the early stage of my cancer. I am glad he did. In addition, the psa score seems to be the real monkey wrench in all of this. I am still baffled that mine at surgery was only 2.9. Good luck with your Kegels! Fran",

      "Content": "Interesting Bill! The obvious question, I suppose, is because the Gleason score can routinely be higher in post surgery pathology, could the Gleason 6 originally diagnosed really have been a 7? In my case, the initial biopsy showed one side involved but the final pathology showed both sides with cancer. I had initially decided to probably wait till this fall to have the surgery, but my urologist convinced me to act more quickly and take advantage of the early stage of my cancer. I am glad he did. In addition, the psa score seems to be the real monkey wrench in all of this. I am still baffled that mine at surgery was only 2.9. Good luck with your Kegels! Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome Bob. Sorry you have to join our little club. You will get great insight and advice here. I don't think there is a person here who hasn't benefited from being here because we all are in the same boat! However, everyone's pca is a little different. That's what makes it hard to recommend a treatment option for anyone as no two are the same. What worked for me doesn't necessarily work for you. And that is emotionally as well as physically. Give the troops here as much information as you can on your test results and history and you will get some great feedback. Also pick up a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book Surviving Prostate Cancer. It is considered one of the bibles on the subject. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

Nighttime fairly dry but getting up every 2-3 hours to empty my bladder. Great stream but small to medium volume. Moving during the day very little control. Sitting during the day, I seem to hold urine and if I \"Kegel\" all the way to the bathroom, I can empty my bladder before leaking. Any activity, uncontrollable leaking. A little more control every day, so I am being patient, doing Kegels, and hoping for continued improvement . Fran",

Nights staying dry but empty the bladder two to three times during the night. Down to two pads during the day and one overnight which stays pretty dry. ED is my main concern now as there is nothing going on even with Viagra help as of now. Using the pump which works ok but hoping the nerves start working sometime soon. Good luck on your continued recovery. Fran",

      "Content": "Knowledge, although confusing at times, is power, Joe. Your stats say that 2 put of 100 will be severely affected by PC. The big question is are you willing to take the chance of being one of those two! There is a saying on this forum that NO two cases of PC are exactly the same, so you cannot look for the one that is like your case and do what he did! Some, like myself, had an easier time at making a treatment decision because the stats were weighted in the treatment direction, like my having a G7 diagnosis. Not sure what I would have decided had it been G6. In any case, do your research, decide what you are going to do, and go for it and don't look back. What ever you decide, it will be right for YOU! Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome to the club Dave although sorry you had to join. Ottago is correct. You are the perfect candidate for AS ( active surveillance ) . Even with advances in the last year or so, Walsh's book remains relevant so it would be worth picking up a copy to read and use as a reference guide. You have come to a great place for insight and advice. Many will chime in on your situation and if you have any specific questions, fire away. All are here to help. Good luck and stay positive.

You will find as you research and read the stories here, that no two pca cases are the same. You cannot look for the case that is just like yours and do what they did...it does not exist. You will have to research as best you can, find a doctor you trust, decide on a treatment plan and go for it, confident in your decision.

      "Content": "Welcome to the site wishful! You have come to a great place for information and insight. To begin, don't get too nervous about your 4.9 PSA ...it does not suggest you have prostate cancer in and of itself. High normal for a person of your age is 4.0. A DRE is certainly next up so your urologist can determine if there is anything abnormal about the size and shape of your prostate. Depending what that shows, he may suggest a biopsy to look for any cancerous tumors. The biopsy, though uncomfortable is relatively painless. A DRE can stimulate your prostate to artificially inflate your PSA some, so make sure the blood draw happens prior to the DRE. I would not worry too much, until a biopsy confirms any cancer you might have and even then, there is a chance that it may be low grade giving you many options including watchful waiting (active surveillance ) to see how it progresses. Many on the forum will chime in so stay tuned. Good luck and stay positive ! Fran",

As to your question about symptoms, there are significant ones for BPH that don't necessarily mean any cancer and there can be cancer with absolutely no symptoms. No two prostate cancer victims have exactly the same disease. There is no exact duplicate of your issue that you can find to study and copy. Just continue to research, ask questions and test and search out the best answer for you. There are many ,many threads on this forum you can read for initial guidance. Good luck and stay positive.

Sounds like your urologist favors the treat first protocol. You and your husband will ultimately have to make that decision. That's a tough one and I don't know what I would do. Concentrate on recovery now. In a few weeks he'll feel almost back to normal and you can then start to consider your options. Good luck and stay positive! Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome to the site wishful! You have come to a great place for information and insight. To begin, don't get too nervous about your 4.9 PSA ...it does not suggest you have prostate cancer in and of itself. High normal for a person of your age is 4.0. A DRE is certainly next up so your urologist can determine if there is anything abnormal about the size and shape of your prostate. Depending what that shows, he may suggest a biopsy to look for any cancerous tumors. The biopsy, though uncomfortable is relatively painless. A DRE can stimulate your prostate to artificially inflate your PSA some, so make sure the blood draw happens prior to the DRE. I would not worry too much, until a biopsy confirms any cancer you might have and even then, there is a chance that it may be low grade giving you many options including watchful waiting (active surveillance ) to see how it progresses. Many on the forum will chime in so stay tuned. Good luck and stay positive ! Fran",

You had major plumbing reconstruction during major surgery even though you only have 5 or 6 small scares to show for it. It is easy to think that you are more healed than you really are. For the majority of RALP victims, it takes months to get to a point where you have decent urine control. My experience is that the urge to urinate has also been redirected and you have to learn what the new urge feels like. I still wake up in the middle of the night on occasion not realizing why until it dawns on me my body is telling me it's time to pee. It was almost a year to the day that I was able to throw the small shields in the trash and considered myself fully continent. Be patient and stay positive. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome to the site wishful! You have come to a great place for information and insight. To begin, don't get too nervous about your 4.9 PSA ...it does not suggest you have prostate cancer in and of itself. High normal for a person of your age is 4.0. A DRE is certainly next up so your urologist can determine if there is anything abnormal about the size and shape of your prostate. Depending what that shows, he may suggest a biopsy to look for any cancerous tumors. The biopsy, though uncomfortable is relatively painless. A DRE can stimulate your prostate to artificially inflate your PSA some, so make sure the blood draw happens prior to the DRE. I would not worry too much, until a biopsy confirms any cancer you might have and even then, there is a chance that it may be low grade giving you many options including watchful waiting (active surveillance ) to see how it progresses. Many on the forum will chime in so stay tuned. Good luck and stay positive ! Fran",

      "Content": "Dennis, relax and take a breath! The PSA is just a number. In my case it was artificially low because I was on a drug to shrink my prostate due to BPH, which caused me weak urine stream and other problem and some ED issues. My urologist caught my cancer early, by paying attention to subtle differences in the feel of my prostate over 5 years and biopsies that finally found some cancer on the third biopsy. It takes those three tests to confirm any cancer. As to your question about symptoms, there are significant ones for BPH that don't necessarily mean any cancer and there can be cancer with absolutely no symptoms. No two prostate cancer victims have exactly the same disease. There is no exact duplicate of your issue that you can find to study and copy. Just continue to research, ask questions and test and search out the best answer for you. There are many ,many threads on this forum you can read for initial guidance. Good luck and stay positive.

      "Content": "Welcome to the site wishful! You have come to a great place for information and insight. To begin, don't get too nervous about your 4.9 PSA ...it does not suggest you have prostate cancer in and of itself. High normal for a person of your age is 4.0. A DRE is certainly next up so your urologist can determine if there is anything abnormal about the size and shape of your prostate. Depending what that shows, he may suggest a biopsy to look for any cancerous tumors. The biopsy, though uncomfortable is relatively painless. A DRE can stimulate your prostate to artificially inflate your PSA some, so make sure the blood draw happens prior to the DRE. I would not worry too much, until a biopsy confirms any cancer you might have and even then, there is a chance that it may be low grade giving you many options including watchful waiting (active surveillance ) to see how it progresses. Many on the forum will chime in so stay tuned. Good luck and stay positive ! Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome cmcona, sorry to hear you are joining our club. To the question of considering surgery, I would recommend that you find a surgeon you trust and go for it. There are many stories here of men who chose to wait and found out later that more aggressive cancer was missed on biopsy and/or it had spread outside the prostate putting them in a worse predicament. Like my case, I would take advantage of finding it early and have it removed. You are young enough that you should recover nicely and have many more cancer free years with your grandkids. I was lucky enough that my urologist was paying attention, found my cancer early and is also an excellent surgeon with 1000+ daVinci's behind him. I am a member of the Zero Club (no detectable psa) and expect to remain a member and three months post surgery, I am as active as I was before with minor incontinence that is still improving every week. If you had BPH for 10 years you probably experienced some ED issues during that time like I did. I am hoping that I get back to the level of function I had before surgery or better, but that takes the longest so I will just have to wait and see. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

      "Content": "Just passed the 3 yr anniversary of my DaVinci surgery. Figured I would let those new to the game know that things are still A-OK after 3 years. Incontinence is not an issue and there doesn't seem to be any change in that regard as I get older, soon to be 66. I continue to struggle with ED but had serious issues before surgery, so wasn't expecting any great change for the better in that regard anyway. Aside from that I remain very active and tell everyone it's almost like it never happened. So, those of you just starting your recovery or about to have surgery, I am here to tell you there is life after prostate cancer surgery. Hang in there. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome cmcona, sorry to hear you are joining our club. To the question of considering surgery, I would recommend that you find a surgeon you trust and go for it. There are many stories here of men who chose to wait and found out later that more aggressive cancer was missed on biopsy and/or it had spread outside the prostate putting them in a worse predicament. Like my case, I would take advantage of finding it early and have it removed. You are young enough that you should recover nicely and have many more cancer free years with your grandkids. I was lucky enough that my urologist was paying attention, found my cancer early and is also an excellent surgeon with 1000+ daVinci's behind him. I am a member of the Zero Club (no detectable psa) and expect to remain a member and three months post surgery, I am as active as I was before with minor incontinence that is still improving every week. If you had BPH for 10 years you probably experienced some ED issues during that time like I did. I am hoping that I get back to the level of function I had before surgery or better, but that takes the longest so I will just have to wait and see. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome to our club. Very sorry you had to join! You will get excellent advice and support here. You will learn quickly that no two prostate cancers are the same. That makes it difficult to follow any prescribed path because what is good for me may not be the best treatment for you. In my case, finding G 7 cancer early enough, the obvious choice for me was surgery. AS was off the table, and I wanted to take advantage of finding it early, and believed surgery would most probably rid me of cancer. The jury will be out for a while but it looks good so far. It would be prudent to get a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book, Surviving Prostrate Cancer. It is consider the bible on the subject. Others here will chime in with their take on your situation. Good luck and keep us informed. Fran",

      "Content": "If there is any chance that it is still organ confined, I would guess your urologist will suggest surgery. Surgery is delayed until 6-8 weeks after a biopsy to allow the prostate to heal. If you go that route, make sure your surgeon has quite a few hundred surgeries to his credit. As our administrator Chuck likes to say, you only get one shot at this so make it a good one! Stay positive and let us know how your consult goes on the 20th. Fran",

I was in your shoes in my 50's and it took me three biopsies over 6 years to finally confirm pca. Because my urologist and I were paying close attention, we are convinced we found it early and after surgery I am and will remain cancer free (at least prostate cancer!). Finding and treating it early is a huge plus depending on how aggressive it is. You might get a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book Surviving Prostate Cancer.

As far as surgery, be prepared to be catheterized for 7-10 days or more. For some of us who had the robotic surgery, that was the toughest to get used to. To prepare for that, loose fitting sweat pants or the like would be good for your trip home from the hospital and at home while dealing with your urine bag. Most here would tell you to use the large bag almost exclusively as the small leg bag is more a hassle than it is worth. I would expect that you will have trouble getting in and out of a chair or bed for the first week and stairs will be difficult. Slow and easy was always our mantra as the healing process begins. Good luck and stay positive! Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome to our club. Very sorry you had to join! You will get excellent advice and support here. You will learn quickly that no two prostate cancers are the same. That makes it difficult to follow any prescribed path because what is good for me may not be the best treatment for you. In my case, finding G 7 cancer early enough, the obvious choice for me was surgery. AS was off the table, and I wanted to take advantage of finding it early, and believed surgery would most probably rid me of cancer. The jury will be out for a while but it looks good so far. It would be prudent to get a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book, Surviving Prostrate Cancer. It is consider the bible on the subject. Others here will chime in with their take on your situation. Good luck and keep us informed. Fran",

I am sure there are examples of very high psa's with little or no cancer and/or low Gleason score disease. I got all worked up after my second biopsy and it ended up negative. In an ironic twist, I was far calmer on the third and found it much easier accepting the positive finding. Go figure! This forum has a wealth of knowledge and insight and helped me immensely! Good luck and stay positive! Fran",

      "Content": "Interesting Bill! The obvious question, I suppose, is because the Gleason score can routinely be higher in post surgery pathology, could the Gleason 6 originally diagnosed really have been a 7? In my case, the initial biopsy showed one side involved but the final pathology showed both sides with cancer. I had initially decided to probably wait till this fall to have the surgery, but my urologist convinced me to act more quickly and take advantage of the early stage of my cancer. I am glad he did. In addition, the psa score seems to be the real monkey wrench in all of this. I am still baffled that mine at surgery was only 2.9. Good luck with your Kegels! Fran",

I had been looking forward to this option after reading the posts about Bimix and Trimix. Somewhat surprised that he has prescribed Edex which I have not heard anything about on this forum. Anyone out there have any experience with this drug? Looking forward to trying this, but want to know as much about it as possible. Thanks in advance! Fran",

Much depends on your age, physical health, mindset and many other factors. As you can see in my signature, I was 62 when diagnosed with a PSA of 2.9 but ended up with G7 in both lobes after surgical pathology. I am hoping because of early detection, we got it all out and I will remain cancer free. We'll see. Read a bunch of the threads on this forum for a wealth of info. Also pick up a copy of Dr. Walsh's book Surviving Prostate Cancer as it is considered one of the bibles on the subject. Stay tuned as many more will weigh in. Give us your age and as many of your stats and history as you can. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

You will find that no two PCa are the same so you can't look for the one like yours and follow that treatment plan. What works for someone else might not be right for you. For me, finding Gleason 7 cancer early made my decision for surgery seem easy. I am convinced that surgery has left me cancer free and I expect to stay that way. After four months now it's almost like it never happened. Sure there was discomfort and side effects, but being rid of the cancer was important to me, not just physically but emotionally as well. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome Israel. Sorry to hear of your plight. I was in your same predicament some years ago in my late 50's. Over the course of 6 years I had three biopsies before pca was found. Funny, I was convinced and prepared for a positive finding after the second but it to was negative. When pc was found on the third a couple of years later, I was actually relieved to find it, convinced that we were paying attention and found it really early with only one core of 14 positive. Now after surgery I am and hope to remain cancer free and am pretty happy how everything went, even with some slight incontinence and ED issues still. I hope you don't have and don't get pc but if you do, find it early and treat it aggressively and get on with your life. You should pick up a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book Surviving Prostate Cancer. It is considered one of the bibles on the subject. good luck and stay positive. Fran",

To begin, don't get too nervous about your 4.9 PSA ...it does not suggest you have prostate cancer in and of itself. High normal for a person of your age is 4.0. A DRE is certainly next up so your urologist can determine if there is anything abnormal about the size and shape of your prostate. Depending what that shows, he may suggest a biopsy to look for any cancerous tumors. The biopsy, though uncomfortable is relatively painless. A DRE can stimulate your prostate to artificially inflate your PSA some, so make sure the blood draw happens prior to the DRE. I would not worry too much, until a biopsy confirms any cancer you might have and even then, there is a chance that it may be low grade giving you many options including watchful waiting (active surveillance ) to see how it progresses.

      "Content": "Dennis, relax and take a breath! The PSA is just a number. In my case it was artificially low because I was on a drug to shrink my prostate due to BPH, which caused me weak urine stream and other problem and some ED issues. My urologist caught my cancer early, by paying attention to subtle differences in the feel of my prostate over 5 years and biopsies that finally found some cancer on the third biopsy. It takes those three tests to confirm any cancer. As to your question about symptoms, there are significant ones for BPH that don't necessarily mean any cancer and there can be cancer with absolutely no symptoms. No two prostate cancer victims have exactly the same disease. There is no exact duplicate of your issue that you can find to study and copy. Just continue to research, ask questions and test and search out the best answer for you. There are many ,many threads on this forum you can read for initial guidance. Good luck and stay positive.

      "Content": "Welcome Israel. Sorry to hear of your plight. I was in your same predicament some years ago in my late 50's. Over the course of 6 years I had three biopsies before pca was found. Funny, I was convinced and prepared for a positive finding after the second but it to was negative. When pc was found on the third a couple of years later, I was actually relieved to find it, convinced that we were paying attention and found it really early with only one core of 14 positive. Now after surgery I am and hope to remain cancer free and am pretty happy how everything went, even with some slight incontinence and ED issues still. I hope you don't have and don't get pc but if you do, find it early and treat it aggressively and get on with your life. You should pick up a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book Surviving Prostate Cancer. It is considered one of the bibles on the subject. good luck and stay positive. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome to our club but sorry you were forced to join. Great advice on this site. It helped me immensely. Please note that almost no two cancers are exactly alike so it is hard to put yours into a particular slot for comparison with others. I also was diagnosed at 62 but no history in my family. I have wondered out loud more than once, how I would have done things differently if I was diagnosed G6 instead of G7! I often thought that the G7 made my decision easy, and after daVinci surgery about 18 months ago, I have remained cancer free and other than pretty severe ED which I had from BPH prior to surgery, it is almost like it never happened. My BPH had me under my urologists scrutiny for some years until cancer was found at a third biopsy, so I was lucky enough to find mine early. This gave little chance that my cancer had escaped the prostate and a good chance for a cure. Only future PSA testing will confirm that but I am very confident. Continue to monitor your PSA, DRE's, and if warranted more biopsies and hopefully after much research, you will find a treatment choice that is perfect for you. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

You will find that no two PCa are the same so you can't look for the one like yours and follow that treatment plan. What works for someone else might not be right for you. For me, finding Gleason 7 cancer early made my decision for surgery seem easy. I am convinced that surgery has left me cancer free and I expect to stay that way. After four months now it's almost like it never happened. Sure there was discomfort and side effects, but being rid of the cancer was important to me, not just physically but emotionally as well. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome to our club but sorry you were forced to join. Great advice on this site. It helped me immensely. Please note that almost no two cancers are exactly alike so it is hard to put yours into a particular slot for comparison with others. I also was diagnosed at 62 but no history in my family. I have wondered out loud more than once, how I would have done things differently if I was diagnosed G6 instead of G7! I often thought that the G7 made my decision easy, and after daVinci surgery about 18 months ago, I have remained cancer free and other than pretty severe ED which I had from BPH prior to surgery, it is almost like it never happened. My BPH had me under my urologists scrutiny for some years until cancer was found at a third biopsy, so I was lucky enough to find mine early. This gave little chance that my cancer had escaped the prostate and a good chance for a cure. Only future PSA testing will confirm that but I am very confident. Continue to monitor your PSA, DRE's, and if warranted more biopsies and hopefully after much research, you will find a treatment choice that is perfect for you. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome to our club but sorry you were forced to join. Great advice on this site. It helped me immensely. Please note that almost no two cancers are exactly alike so it is hard to put yours into a particular slot for comparison with others. I also was diagnosed at 62 but no history in my family. I have wondered out loud more than once, how I would have done things differently if I was diagnosed G6 instead of G7! I often thought that the G7 made my decision easy, and after daVinci surgery about 18 months ago, I have remained cancer free and other than pretty severe ED which I had from BPH prior to surgery, it is almost like it never happened. My BPH had me under my urologists scrutiny for some years until cancer was found at a third biopsy, so I was lucky enough to find mine early. This gave little chance that my cancer had escaped the prostate and a good chance for a cure. Only future PSA testing will confirm that but I am very confident. Continue to monitor your PSA, DRE's, and if warranted more biopsies and hopefully after much research, you will find a treatment choice that is perfect for you. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

I continue to think the biopsies found my cancer early enough that surgery has left me cancer free and that was the whole point. In your case, I would not hesitate to have another biopsy and see where you stand. I agree with Fairwind...an MRI and/or CT scan is no substitute for a biopsy. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

To begin, don't get too nervous about your 4.9 PSA ...it does not suggest you have prostate cancer in and of itself. High normal for a person of your age is 4.0. A DRE is certainly next up so your urologist can determine if there is anything abnormal about the size and shape of your prostate. Depending what that shows, he may suggest a biopsy to look for any cancerous tumors. The biopsy, though uncomfortable is relatively painless. A DRE can stimulate your prostate to artificially inflate your PSA some, so make sure the blood draw happens prior to the DRE. I would not worry too much, until a biopsy confirms any cancer you might have and even then, there is a chance that it may be low grade giving you many options including watchful waiting (active surveillance ) to see how it progresses.

      "Content": "Dennis, relax and take a breath! The PSA is just a number. In my case it was artificially low because I was on a drug to shrink my prostate due to BPH, which caused me weak urine stream and other problem and some ED issues. My urologist caught my cancer early, by paying attention to subtle differences in the feel of my prostate over 5 years and biopsies that finally found some cancer on the third biopsy. It takes those three tests to confirm any cancer. As to your question about symptoms, there are significant ones for BPH that don't necessarily mean any cancer and there can be cancer with absolutely no symptoms. No two prostate cancer victims have exactly the same disease. There is no exact duplicate of your issue that you can find to study and copy. Just continue to research, ask questions and test and search out the best answer for you. There are many ,many threads on this forum you can read for initial guidance. Good luck and stay positive.

      "Content": "Welcome to the site wishful! You have come to a great place for information and insight. To begin, don't get too nervous about your 4.9 PSA ...it does not suggest you have prostate cancer in and of itself. High normal for a person of your age is 4.0. A DRE is certainly next up so your urologist can determine if there is anything abnormal about the size and shape of your prostate. Depending what that shows, he may suggest a biopsy to look for any cancerous tumors. The biopsy, though uncomfortable is relatively painless. A DRE can stimulate your prostate to artificially inflate your PSA some, so make sure the blood draw happens prior to the DRE. I would not worry too much, until a biopsy confirms any cancer you might have and even then, there is a chance that it may be low grade giving you many options including watchful waiting (active surveillance ) to see how it progresses. Many on the forum will chime in so stay tuned. Good luck and stay positive ! Fran",

Each was triggered by a psa rise or an abnormal DRE and in each case, I concurred with my doctor in having the biopsy. I was lucky enough to find my cancer early and after surgery, with luck, I will remain cancer free. What is your psa and what are your DRE results? By the way, I was treating my BPH with Avodart which did a great job shrinking my prostate and lowering psa (2.9) at diagnosis. Fran",

      "Content": "Welcome to our club, Tom. You have gotten some great advise from some of our distinguished members. I would add that if you decide on a surgeon or facility for surgery, schedule it asap so you will have a slot reserved. You have to wait 6 weeks from biopsy before surgery anyway so might as well line up a spot. You can always cancel if you opt to go another route. Also know that your case is unique. You will not find another just like it so don't waste time looking for the success story to copy. Do your research, choose a treatment and don't look back. Whatever you decide will be right for you! good luck and stay positive. Fran",

That makes it difficult to follow any prescribed path because what is good for me may not be the best treatment for you. In my case, finding G 7 cancer early enough, the obvious choice for me was surgery. AS was off the table, and I wanted to take advantage of finding it early, and believed surgery would most probably rid me of cancer. The jury will be out for a while but it looks good so far. It would be prudent to get a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book, Surviving Prostrate Cancer. It is consider the bible on the subject. Others here will chime in with their take on your situation.

I was in your shoes in my 50's and it took me three biopsies over 6 years to finally confirm pca. Because my urologist and I were paying close attention, we are convinced we found it early and after surgery I am and will remain cancer free (at least prostate cancer!). Finding and treating it early is a huge plus depending on how aggressive it is. You might get a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book Surviving Prostate Cancer. It is considered one of the bibles on the subject. Good luck and let us know how you make out. Fran",

      "Content": "The catheter was the big shock for me and the worst part of the ordeal. My first impression was that they had inserted a 5/8\" garden hose up my penis! Getting used to the catheter and urine bag takes some effort. Insist that your nurse get you some Velcro leg attachments for the catheter tube and stick it on your upper thigh. It will minimize the movement of the tube and therefore increase your comfort level. Also insist on some lidocaine cream for the tip of your penis and use it often. Come up with a plan for rolling out of bed and recliners you are in which will minimize the discomfort considerably. Walking as often as you can will help speed your recovery and give you something to do. Forget the leg bag and use the large collection bag almost exclusively. The leg bag is far more trouble than it is worth. Almost everyone adds Metamucil or similar stool softener to their diet to help with your first bowel movement. Good luck Tuesday and we look forward to hearing from you on the other side! Fran",

Surgery is delayed until 6-8 weeks after a biopsy to allow the prostate to heal. If you go that route, make sure your surgeon has quite a few hundred surgeries to his credit. As our administrator Chuck likes to say, you only get one shot at this so make it a good one! Stay positive and let us know how your consult goes on the 20th. Fran",

Haven't posted in quite some time but was brought back having found out a 54 year old cousin just had surgery at Dana Farber in Boston. His initial biopsy pathology was 7 +8's but a re-read by DF had it at 8 +9's with a PSA of 36. I have given him as much advice as I could and suggested he check out this forum and hope he does. I am waiting to see what his final pathology report is and if he had negative margins and no vesicles or lymph nodes involved. Hoping for the best for him. I continue on with yearly PSA tests of 0 with no continence problems but severe ED, which I have pretty much have grown accustomed to. Fran",

I had blood in my ejaculate for about two weeks. Turns it dark brown. I would surmize that the you could have sex at this point and the sooner you clear that old blood from your system the sooner it will be back to normal. It is kind of disconcerting looking, but wife was prepared and ok with it. Good luck and I'm sure you are anxious for the results. Fran",

I found, and reiterated here often, that the catheter was by far the most difficult issue to deal with in the whole daVinci surgery process (at least for me). My surgeon likes to leave his patients catheters in for two weeks. I considered myself lucky to have been able to have it removed on the 12th day. Good luck...Friday will be here before you know it.

Whichever would give you the best chance of a cure would be my choice. You could always hire a visiting nurse or home instead worker to help you through the recovery after surgery, if that is your choice. You would only need someone part time for a week or so, before you could handle it on your own. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

Whichever would give you the best chance of a cure would be my choice. You could always hire a visiting nurse or home instead worker to help you through the recovery after surgery, if that is your choice. You would only need someone part time for a week or so, before you could handle it on your own. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

Do you have other symptoms like weak urine flow or ED issues which point to an enlarged prostate? I had three biopsies ever 6 years to check for PC and never had any issues of infection or pain. I had what I considered a very conscientious and experienced urologist who I trusted enough to do my surgery and believe he has got me cancer free.

Laying down is no problem. Also as mentioned get them to give you the litacaine cream for the tip of your penis...it starts getting sore pretty quickly. Good luck! Fran",

Use this time before surgery to read up on what you need to know to make it as smooth an ordeal as possible. You can also work on your diet and exercise to be in as good condition as possible before your surgery. Good luck and stay positive. Many of us on the forum have been in your position. Remember there is life after Prostate cancer. Fran",

If you can give more info on your situation like values of your PSA tests and Gleason score of your biopsy, the troops can chime in more accurately. In any event, your PSA can fluctuate for a variety of reasons between tests for anything that stimulates the prostate like sex, DRE by your doctor, certain activities like bike riding, etc. Also, certain foods and drugs can play a role in fluctuations. It looks like you are doing active surveillance so continued success and stay positive. Fran",

I too am very pleased with how things have gone. My incontinence is starting to come around after 12 days of catheterization. How is you urine control going and if you would give your age. As for the travel question, I would avoid longer travel for a few days. Sitting was quite difficult for a number of weeks and remains a little sore even now almost a month post surgery. Reclining worked the best for me ( and still does) to eliminate direct pressure on the area where all the plumbing was rearranged. Good luck! Fran",

My doctor, who I have great confidence in, is for the longer catheterization. He wanted two weeks and I kind of talked him in to 12 days. I am seeing steady improvement, but because I had urinary and erection issues before surgery, I expect some to return post surgery and we'll deal with them as best we can. I returned to work 1/2 days after three weeks and other than filling up a number of Depends every day, feel great. Night time I stay dry but have to empty my bladder three to four times a night as muscles can' t hold back much volume yet.

I returned to work 1/2 days after three weeks and other than filling up a number of Depends every day, feel great. Night time I stay dry but have to empty my bladder three to four times a night as muscles can' t hold back much volume yet. Sorry you had to join the club at 46, but you're lucky to have found it early and here's to remaining cancer free for many years to come!",

I too am very pleased with how things have gone. My incontinence is starting to come around after 12 days of catheterization. How is you urine control going and if you would give your age. As for the travel question, I would avoid longer travel for a few days. Sitting was quite difficult for a number of weeks and remains a little sore even now almost a month post surgery. Reclining worked the best for me ( and still does) to eliminate direct pressure on the area where all the plumbing was rearranged. Good luck! Fran",

I am wondering if you allowed your doctor to perform the DRE and if so, what the results were. It is the results of this test, along with PSA results that drove my three biopsies that eventually found G7 cancer. Did your doctor identify something during the DRE that triggered her advice for a biopsy? You sound like someone who is willing to roll the dice and hope the odds are in your favor. I wish you luck with that. I, for one, aren't willing to let luck play any roll in my health. Fran",

Many on this forum have been through the surgery so we can help ease your anxiety a little. If you haven't noticed there are stickies at the top of the page that are common themes that all are interested in and have much information in them. You may find that as your surgery date gets closer, looking forward to getting it behind you. Good luck and stay positive. Fran",

As far as your surgeon, most here recommend that you find one that has done at least 500 daVinci prostatectemies....Welcome cmcona, sorry to hear you are joining our club. To the question of considering surgery, I would recommend that you find a surgeon you trust and go for it....I was pleasantly surprised to be able to walk out of the hospital the day after my surgery and would recommend it to anyone. I didn't have the balls before surgery, but after, I watched the surgery on YouTube and in the hands of a skilled surgeon the robot is an amazing tool....As far as your surgeon, most here recommend that you find one that has done at least 500 daVinci prostatectemies. As Highlander, an administrator here who is sure to chime in, likes to say, you only get one shot at this!...You have gotten some great advise from some of our distinguished members. I would add that if you decide on a surgeon or facility for surgery, schedule it asap so you will have a slot reserved....If you have the means, there are many here who would suggest you search out the best urologist to do your surgery, even if it means traveling to John Hopkins or a similar center of excellence. One that has thousands of surgeries under his belt....To the question of considering surgery, I would recommend that you find a surgeon you trust and go for it. There are many stories here of men who chose to wait and found out later that more aggressive cancer was missed on biopsy and/or it had spread outside the prostate putting them in a worse predicament....I had the daVinci and am very happy with the results. If you have the means, there are many here who would suggest you search out the best urologist to do your surgery, even if it means traveling to John Hopkins or a similar center of excellence....I had what I considered a very conscientious and experienced urologist who I trusted enough to do my surgery and believe he has got me cancer free. They do exist and I would suggest you find yourself one....If there is any chance that it is still organ confined, I would guess your urologist will suggest surgery....If there is any chance that it is still organ confined, I would guess your urologist will suggest surgery. Surgery is delayed until 6-8 weeks after a biopsy to allow the prostate to heal....",
