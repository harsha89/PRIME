He has had very few side effects from the chemo or the radiation and hormone therapy he's had in the past couple months. He's just starting to lose some hair and had a kind of blotchy rash on his arm (probably from the sun), but he didn't even have the crash days that people complain of. Fingers crossed that this continues during future cycles. They seem to have manipulated the Taxotere to make it more tolerable.

He has had very few side effects from the chemo or the radiation and hormone therapy he's had in the past couple months. He's just starting to lose some hair and had a kind of blotchy rash on his arm (probably from the sun), but he didn't even have the crash days that people complain of. Fingers crossed that this continues during future cycles. They seem to have manipulated the Taxotere to make it more tolerable. I've read that chemo can help with the pain from bone mets too if that's an issue. Good luck to you and your dad.",
