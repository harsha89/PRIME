      "Content": "Agree with all above comments. In my research of the medical literature I found two other items. First, the uPSA can also react to antigens in the blood from exposure to household animals. These can be corrected for. A second frequent comment I found was that the uPSA was good for \"early warning\", but several writers recommended that decision making on treatment be based upon standard PSA testing. The recommendation for always using the same lab is also important.",

At one week followup, he stated that this would be too risky because of my MS, fearful of permanent damage to bowel and bladder control, also walking. Consult with PCP who sent me to medical oncologist who recommended radiation. Saw radiation oncologist who was extremely hesitant for the same reasons, risk of permanent damage and lack of guidance from medical literature. He recommended consult with a major cancer center that may have actually treated MS patients. Still working on that. I have reviewed PubMed, there is a scattering of descriptive reports on radiation therapy on cancer patients with MS, almost all with negative outcomes about half the time -- particularly when brain is involved. Since this would be at the other end, I was looking for anyone who had been in a similar situation. Thank you for your interest and response. By the way, how do I get the \"stats\" on my cancer to appear each time, is there a \"signature\" function?",
