Ihave been having a difficult time urinating for several years but with Flomax I was able to get the job done.In the recent past my PSA numbers have been from 3.86 to about 4.25. Digital have never found anything. Last Saturday night I noticed a painful urination and very slow stream. Sunday morning early my stream stopped completely and I had to go to ER. I was put on antibiotics for a very bad UTI. They installed a cath and it is there to this day. The nurses at the urologist were going to pull it out but I had strong bladder spasms. As the doctor was delayed at surgery they left it in and sent me home. I am to see the doctor this Wed. morning. Am I destined to remain with this cath for the rest of my life? Will the Dr. do scans to check for cancer? As far as I know the penal relief tube is still blocked. I know because Two days ago I had them remove to cath anyway only to be back in ER later that night. I am sorry for the long story but I am scared and my wife doesn't seem to be of much help right now. Thank you, Donald.",

      "Content": "Jim and Chuck, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I was first diagnosed with BPH almost 15 years ago. My GP told me it was very large but did not show any signs of a problem. Not too long after that I went on Flomax and it helped a lot. For awhile. I later went off of it until recently. The urination stream gradually got weaker and weaker. Over the past few weeks I noticed that the stream was just a dribble and it felt like I always had some left when I finished. I guess I should have taken this as a warning shot. A perfect set up for a UTI. And that is what happened. I am sure that the Dr will want a scan when I see him on Wed and I guess that would be a good place to start. I would assume that he will also take a new PSA. I would also be curious as to the number. It has been over a year since my last one. But what confuses me is what protocol is used to get me off of the cath shorter term than using something like Avodart? It takes time for that stuff to work and for some the results are not good. I hope he has a plan for this. It will be my first visit. Even though he didn't actually see me, he was the one that wanted me to understand that when I went in to the office to have his nurse remove that last cath, that the problem could return. And it did. Perhaps the infection is still there? His nurse has me doing \"bladder retraining\". I think that is good and hope it helps with the spasms but seems kind of academic if no urine will pass. Donald.",

      "Content": "Hello friends. I am new here but have been well acquainted with prostate issues for many years. Ihave been having a difficult time urinating for several years but with Flomax I was able to get the job done.In the recent past my PSA numbers have been from 3.86 to about 4.25. Digital have never found anything. Last Saturday night I noticed a painful urination and very slow stream. Sunday morning early my stream stopped completely and I had to go to ER. I was put on antibiotics for a very bad UTI. They installed a cath and it is there to this day. The nurses at the urologist were going to pull it out but I had strong bladder spasms. As the doctor was delayed at surgery they left it in and sent me home. I am to see the doctor this Wed. morning. Am I destined to remain with this cath for the rest of my life? Will the Dr. do scans to check for cancer? As far as I know the penal relief tube is still blocked. I know because Two days ago I had them remove to cath anyway only to be back in ER later that night. I am sorry for the long story but I am scared and my wife doesn't seem to be of much help right now. Thank you, Donald.",
