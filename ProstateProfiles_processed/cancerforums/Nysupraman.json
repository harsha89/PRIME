I have also heard of Dr. Klein's name elsewhere, I do not know if the initial consultation is with him, but I will definitely look for him time comes surgery if that is the route they will choose. I feel very confident with Cleveland Clinic and hope to come back from Ohio next week with some good news",

      "Content": "Well guys just got back from Cleveland... I must say service and staff there are top notch! I know I did not mention another side of his story, but the main reason we are already in contact and continue to be seen at Cleveland Clinic is because my father has been also diagnosed with Hepatitis B about a year and a half ago, way before the prostate roadblock. He never knew he had been positive for Hep B, mainly because it usually is seen in the fifth decade of life, and since he emigrated from outside the USA, most likely it is from vertical transmission (passed down from birth from his mother) and he never received a vaccine upon birth. Anyhow, he has liver cirrhosis even though it is functioning at 100% and two small tumors, he has already gotten two chemo-embolizations and is due for a new liver hopefully in the next 6 months! So really he was in perfect health otherwise to receive a transplant before this whole prostate thing came into play. Moving forward and what the urologist said to him based on his situation of course is that surgery would be a bad idea for him, as it would put him at high risk for literally bleeding to death, because liver cirrhosis causes a low platelet count (his current is 78000 or so). He recommended that he either goes the radiation route or go for the Da Vinci robotic surgery. He also suggested that there are some great doctors that he recommends locally, especially if it would be easier for him to go to almost everyday to receive treatment. I wanted to ask some of you gentlemen on here if you have any names of radiation oncologists that you recommend in NY, and also which route do you think would be best based on his situation? Based on my limited knowledge I think that radiation would definitely be his best choice as well. I know that radical prostatectomy is still considered the gold standard and obviously the mental satisfaction of having the damn thing out is favorable, however I also agree with the doctor at Cleveland and do not think it's wise to risk bleeding and having to face a huge transplant surgery in the near future for his liver might be too risky to undergo surgery right now. On a side note I just bought the Walsh guide to surviving prostate cancer to quickly increase my knowledge on the situation so we can make a decision and start treatment as soon as possible, as it would be best for his chances of a \"cure\".",

      "Content": "Hey guys I am very sad to inform everyone that my father has just been diagnosed with \"aggressive\" prostate cancer. My family and I are so heartbroken and worried I really can't stop thinking of the worst possible outcome. We are in New York but made an appointment to see Doctors at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Are they a good choice? I really just need a little assurance from this great community that he has some sort of hope. He is 60 years old with a PSA of 4.5, from what I know it was a 3.5 a year ago. He just had his biopsy one week ago and here are the findings: Left base Adenocarcinoma 4+4=8 involving less than 5% of 1 of 2 cores. Adenocarcinoma 3+4=7 involving 60% of 1 of 2 cores. Left mid Adenocarcinoma 3+4=7 involving 70% and 50% of 2 of 2 cores. Adenocarcinoma 3+3=6 involving 5% of 1 of 2 cores. Right side benign Any words of hope and knowledge will help!",

I will be visiting Cleveland Clinic in Ohio next week and I will give you guys an update as to what is going on. I hope that if he has to wait a couple of weeks, it won't progress too far beyond the prostate! I just pray that they can do something ASAP since he is aggressive!",
