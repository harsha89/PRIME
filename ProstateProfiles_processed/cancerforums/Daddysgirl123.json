      "Content": "My dad received his results today from his biopsy. He had 16 places tested and they all showed cancer. One showed small cell undifferentiated carcianoma and one place showed squamous differentiation. He had a Gleason score of 9 in several places. His doctor said he could have his prostate removed or radiation and hormone therapy and said to next meet with a radiation oncologist which we can't get in with until September 12th. Everything I read seems very grim. Any advice? Also, he has been in severe pain at night when he lays down- but he did have a bone scan and it does not show that it has moved to his bones. Today, the urologist appeared concerned he is in pain. What could all the pain be coming from if it's not an infection that the urologist tested for? I hate all of this waiting! Thanks for any help!",
