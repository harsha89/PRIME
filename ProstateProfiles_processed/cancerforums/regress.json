I'm hoping once the surgery has been scheduled I will feel a little of the psychological weight lift off. I'm interested that you've had a PET and bone scan, an MRI and so many DREs, with a Gleason 6. I'm a Gleason 3+4 and so far both surgeons I've spoken with don't see the need for any additional investigation before surgery (I've had one DRE, a cystoscopy and the biopsy. I did get two opinions on the biopsy slides but that was not suggested by the docs). Max",

      "Content": "Allen, lancepeace, Jim, thanks so much for your replies. Interesting that 0.4 is behind the curve -- so far I've trusted the team @ CoH to be first-rate in every way and really on top of the data. I presume they have data that supports 0.4, I'm speaking with them this week hopefully. I certainly don't want to take any unnecessary risks and I'm young enough and in good enough health to tolerate salvage therapy, I believe, very well. My recovery from surgery has been great, continence almost from the git-go and no major ED. Good point about insurance, Jim -- I figured it was expensive but didn't realize it could be that much -- WOW. I have good insurance, hopefully it won't be problem but these days it wouldn't shock me if there are caveats.",

Have any of you had a similar kind of situation after surgery -- if so I'd love to hear details. At what point was it considered a recurrence? What salvage treatment did you choose and how successful was it? How have you dealt with it mentally and emotionally? Very best wishes to each and everyone on this forum, Max",

However long-term daily use might indeed show a lower PSA reading (at least one study suggested that pomegranate might cause cell death). However the delta would likely be small. It seems like pomegranate \"couldn't hurt\" if you want to kill off a few stray cells, but there is no evidence to indicate that it would ever kill enough cells to really matter.",

Dr. Wilson did a great job answering our questions, anticipating most of them. The hospital has done over 7000 robotic procedures and he has done 2500. I particularly like his motivation to constantly optimize/improve the procedure. We're still in the decision stage but are leaning heavily toward CoH.",

      "Content": "Just a quick update with some thoughts, six weeks post. Surgeon & Hospital The nerve-sparing procedure was performed by Timothy Wilson at City of Hope in the LA area. We drove from out-of-state two days before and stayed ten days after at a nearby hotel at the \"cancer rate\". Dr. Wilson, with over 2500 RALPs, did a great job IMO. CoH was professional, caring and particular. Recommended. Results Three hours in surgery, no complications. Nerves spared. Six incisions. Organ-confined, 15% cancer, 58 grams, Gleason 7 (4+3) upgraded from (3+4), one microscopic unifocal positive margin on the right side. 31 lymph nodes, seminal vesicles, extraprostatic soft tissue all clear. Side Effects Other than some rare stress incontinence, bladder control has been perfect since day one. ED is too soon to tell, although recent \"testing\" over the last several days has been surprisingly successful -- not exactly the same as before, but in the same neighborhood. Taking 5 mg Cialis per day. Recovery Incisions look about 75% healed. I've lost 15 lbs and am in otherwise very good health. Returned to work (non-strenuous) at two weeks. Perineal pain comes and goes, nothing intense but sometimes very annoying. Bowels feel mostly back to normal as of this week, constipation also comes and goes. The biggest surprise is my overall energy level which, although improving daily, is currently at about 70-75% pre-surgery. I've been averaging 10-11 hours sleep vs. 7-8 before. I seem to tire out a bit faster in any event, although that's slowly improving as well. As of this week I can start to resume more normal exercise (I'm a runner) and I'm finally rid of the lifting restriction. Questions How long did it take you to get back to your pre-surgery energy level? I'm a little concerned about the positive margin, a bit glum when I saw that. The surgeon believes it is of little significance. It does change my 10-year non-recurrence from 90% to 86% (Sloan-Kettering). Have any of you had a single tiny positive margin of this nature? If it did reoccur, how soon did it happen, did you get salvage radiation and how did that go? My first post-surgery PSA is coming up and I'm somewhat nervous. And then every three months for the next two years. I've got to get my head around that and figure out a good strategy for dealing with some anxiety there. Any tips? Cheers, Max",

      "Content": "Scheduled for surgery (RALP) a bit less than a month from now at City of Hope! The surgeon is Timothy Wilson. I feel relieved and optimistic (ready to get it done!), although I have an intermittent sort of \"calm anxiety\" under the surface in anticipation of both the procedure and the recovery -- typical, methinks. If anyone has any specific words of advice regarding CoH -- or any other words of wisdom -- please chime in! We'll be there two days before surgery + eight days after (removal of catheter). Scheduled as his second surgery on a Wednesday. I'm a little worried about the drive back (11 hours), but I'll have a fully reclining seat in which to travel, so I think that will be OK.",

I wasn't clear -- we'll be there for eight days after which includes removal of the catheter on day 6 and another 2 days after that in case of any complications from removal (hospital orders).

I hope we don't have to split the drive home into 2 days, would love to get home as soon as possible and I know by then both of us will be sick of hotels.",

I was started on HT about 6 weeks before starting SRT after rising PSA when it reached 0.11 Doctor wanted to hit hard with both barrels. radiation was not that bad, just a little burning toward the end of the 30th treatment. My Radiation Oncologist and I spoke about it and decided that, in my case, SR would be sufficient. My big concern with radiation is long-term toxicity, the way I understand it, >3 years out is when side effects might more likely present due to scar tissue and such. Hence I see SR certainly with some risk -- of course that risk is nothing compared to metastasis.",

Chuck That's kind of what I'm thinking, although I wonder if I'm just putting off the inevitable. The way I understand it, a detectable reading means there are prostate cells of some kind producing PSA, and they must be either normal cells or cancer cells. Do you know if normal cells can even live outside the prostate? I was surprised to see the 0.16 -- I fully expected more like 0.19, e.g. about the same rate of increase. The 0.16 doesn't make sense to me.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 In my view, acting sooner is better than letting the returning cancer an opportunity to spread. In just 5 months, since Oct., 2014, your PSA has more than doubled (PSADT). That, in itself, should be a red flag to your doctor. Sometimes -- not always -- it's best to throw the protocol book out the window. That's just the opinion of one grumpy old geezer. Best of luck. Jim Sage information, Jim. I agree that my doubling time is a big issue here. Do you know if, at numbers < 0.2 and a 4+3, cancer is likely to metastasize? Or would one typically need to have a much higher cell population (and hence higher PSA) to start to see that happen?",
