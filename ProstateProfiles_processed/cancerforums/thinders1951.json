My next PSA is Jan 26th The last entry is for a pelvic MRI. The radiologist observed what he believes is a 9 mm mass. My Urologist is having the MRI reviewed by the Radiation Oncologist who treated me with Salvage Radiation. I do not have the MRI report nor the result of the consultation. Next week I will request. I expect that after the review and consultation, my Urologist will provide a \"next step\". I am expecting one of the following: Wait and see Hormone Replacement Some other form of radiation He mentioned a \"cryo\" process I am also seeking a second opinion, on what other steps I might take (suggestions as to who / how I should get the second opinion welcome) Prostate Cancer Summary YOB 1951 PSA 06/10/2008 3.6 PSA 05/08/2009 6.2 Biopsy 08/2009 Gleason 3+3 CAP from both right base and right mid.
