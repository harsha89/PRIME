      "Signature": "Prostate removed at age 49 on 7/10/2015 at University of Chicago via Dan Vinci by Dr. Eggener First diagnosed with biopsy on 8/2013 after a 5.5 PSA. One core of 12--Gleason 6. Chose active surveillance. PSA stayed same, but yearly biopsy 10/2014 showed a change to Gleason 7 (3+4), still in one core. Since GF died of prostate cancer, and father had his removed at 55 (he's 79 now) I decided to have removed. Final pathology showed cancer confined to prostate, no spread. Wore pads and liners for 3 weeks after catheter removal for drips. Stopped wearing on 8/10/2015! Phewww!!",

      "Content": "Well, 5 weeks after removal, I've finally got rid of liners and pads. I probably could have last week, but wanted the reassurance. It's amazing how strong your floor muscles can be, via kegals. I was scared with all the stories I read about 8 pads a day. etc. I got lucky, and never went thru more than one a day. Perhaps it is my age, or just lucky.",
