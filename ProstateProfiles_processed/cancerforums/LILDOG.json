My uro is pushing for radiation , I am willing to wait because there is no evidence of rise or doubling time. I'm also thinking it may be benign tissue since my psa is low , stable and not rising . Should I RADIATE OR WAIT ? PLEASE HELP !",

Does this mean something was left behind ( prostate tissue etc. ) by the surgeon ? If so could this cause a slight increase in my psa results if i had sex before a psa test ? It really freaked me out to see i was still releasing this clear sticky fluid . Has anyone else experienced this ?",
