      "Content": "Hello, everybody. My name is Samuel. I live in Atlanta, GA. On December 18, 2013, I celebrated my 40th birthday. On July 9th, I went in to get my yearly check up. Everything came back fine except my PSA was a 5.5. I'm sure I don't have to tell you how scared I am. On July 29th, my urologist performed a DRE and said that he found nothing out of the norm. At the same time, he felt that was to be expected. This upcoming Tuesday, I will need to go in for a biopsy on my prostate. There's a part of me that wants to believe I don't have cancer, yet I'm afraid that I may be in for a surprise. The only symptom that is noticeable is frequent trips to the men's room. Those frequent trips seem to be less frequent as time passes. Every so often, I feel a slight pain in my right testicle, but that pain is not unbearable and doesn't last everyday. Sometimes I notice a discomfort in my lower abdomen, but my stool passes through just fine. My uro said he didn't see any infection in my urine sample. He's not a very comforting doctor. So, these are reasons I'm pretty scared. I was wondering if anyone would be kind enough to provide me with some support, any expertise you may have on the subject and what ever else you think I may need. Thank you so much in advance.",

      "Content": "Hello, everybody. My name is Samuel. I live in Atlanta, GA. On December 18, 2013, I celebrated my 40th birthday. On July 9th, I went in to get my yearly check up. Everything came back fine except my PSA was a 5.5. I'm sure I don't have to tell you how scared I am. On July 29th, my urologist performed a DRE and said that he found nothing out of the norm. At the same time, he felt that was to be expected. This upcoming Tuesday, I will need to go in for a biopsy on my prostate. There's a part of me that wants to believe I don't have cancer, yet I'm afraid that I may be in for a surprise. The only symptom that is noticeable is frequent trips to the men's room. Those frequent trips seem to be less frequent as time passes. Every so often, I feel a slight pain in my right testicle, but that pain is not unbearable and doesn't last everyday. Sometimes I notice a discomfort in my lower abdomen, but my stool passes through just fine. My uro said he didn't see any infection in my urine sample. He's not a very comforting doctor. So, these are reasons I'm pretty scared. I was wondering if anyone would be kind enough to provide me with some support, any expertise you may have on the subject and what ever else you think I may need. Thank you so much in advance.",

From a bit of my research, I also read that AIP doesn't require treatment. I also read that AIP has no symptoms. From time to time at night (but not every night), I wake up making frequent trips to urinate. So, my question is if every so often I have to use the men's room quite frequently would that still qualify as AIP? How can I treat this condition?",

Because it was a little difficult to perform the enema myself, I had my nurse to do it for me. Afterwards, I had the biopsy done. Right before my urologist performed the biopsy, he measured and looked at my prostate via ultrasound. He said the prostate is small. He said the number, but I just can't recall what the number was. After he measured and looked at my prostate, he performed the biopsy. My urologist took twelve samples. As he was taking the samples he noticed that there were no nodes visible. When my uro finished the biopsy, he said I should have the results between this and next week.

My primary doctor had blood work done and discovered that my PSA was a 5.5. It's been almost seven months since I turned 40 at the time I had my blood labs. So, he referred me to a urologist. When I saw the uro, he performed a DRE and didn't find anything out of the ordinary. So, he recommends a biopsy. Needless to say in spite of ALL of the wonderful advice and support that I have received on this forum, I am still a bit scared, not as scared, but still scared a bit. I just pray that the results won't be cancer. In these last few days, I have noticed that I'm not making as many trips to urinate. So, I'm beginning to wonder if it was something other than PC. Before I go any further, I would like to ask is urinary incontinence one of the common side effects to having a biopsy on my prostate? If so, how would I address this? I would like to also say to EVERYONE of you who has followed my story and responded with great information and very encouraging words, a great big THANK YOU Sure it's been said before from so many, but had it not been for you, I wouldn't be as calm as I am now. I don't know when the results will come in, but I promise to keep in touch and share my journey. Later this evening or tomorrow, I will share with you my biopsy experience.

      "Content": "Hello, everybody! I just went on to the Emory Healthcare web site and was able to see some of the results from my urinalysis, right before I had my prostate biopsy. Well, the urinalysis results shows a trace of Leukocyte Esterase [White Blood Cells] in my urine. My question is does that mean it's more likely that I have some sort of infection than PC? I haven't received my biopsy results yet, but I was kind of curious. You know what? I just remembered that I took ciprofloxacin like maybe an hr. or so before my biopsy. Do you think the cipro is what the urine test noticed? Based on what I was looking up on the internet, I didn't see any similarities with white blood cell count and prostate cancer. However, it's 3:47am, Atlanta, GA. time. So, I can't call Emory to ask them any questions. Plus, I know that you all are more informed about this than I am. ANY information would be greatly appreciated. Yes, I still need to wait for the biopsy, maybe I could have PC AND some sort of infection. I would just like to know your interpretation of this issue. Thank you!",
