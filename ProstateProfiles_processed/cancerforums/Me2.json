      "Content": "Thank you all for your replies. I thought I had said I have had a recent MRI and a biopsy which is how I knew the suspected location. With your replies and further googling I now have a better idea of \"what\" and \"where\" - and that just raises my concern over \"what next\". I have an appointment with my specialist next week and simply want to be better prepared to understand and to ask pertinent questions. The diffusion restriction area has grown from .5cm to 1.5cm in three months - that's not just 3x bigger it is 27x bigger in volume - seems serious to me. And I read that the anterior side of the prostate and the transition zone in particular are more likely to have faster growth but at the same time statistically less likely to show aggressive malignancy. All of which is why I want to be as prepared as possible for the discussions. Any comments on these points would be appreciated. Finally any comments on how significant this location is with respect to the ease or difficulty of the various possible treatments would be great. Does it rule out robotic surgery? Does it make open surgery more appropriate? Does the less accessible location suggest cryo or seed implantation are more appropriate? Is HIFU ruled out? Etc. Etc. To repeat - I'm just trying to get more background information for a better discussion. Thank you all again.",
