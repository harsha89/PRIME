      "Content": "Hi, Tom here Was on here last year couldn't decide whether to go Brachy Seeds or Surgery Well, went down to FL (we winter there) they had no Da Vinci machines in Sebring BUT They had what looked like an excellent brachy program, rad dr came in from Orlando and I got brachy on 12/23/2014 All went well, didn't even need a catheter, seeds went in at 7:30 and was on the way home shortly after noon. 1st PSA done 4/6/15 showed 1.85 PSA TODAY, 6/28/15 a little over 6 mo out, I scored a 1.2!! I couldn't be happier, I think the seeds are doing/have done their job and did/doing it well Urination is a bit slow, can't take flomax (itch like hell) but I'm doing ok there Sex has yet to materalize, but shows signs of coming back, (I had ED before all this happened) I'm so stoked by my score that isn't even an issue with me right now. So on we go...I made the RIGHT decision for ME it would seem. If you're considering seeding this could be you as well I was a Gleason 6, (3+3) 32CM prostate, had a PSA of 10.4, and cancer near as they could tell was all contained in the prostate My calcium and cholesterol is great too It's good to be alive!",

      "Content": "Hey, thanks for all your input! I may talk to a rad onc next week, just to be sure but at this point I'm leaning towards the open surgery. We DO have robotic available to us here but my Dr doesn't do it. I do know he is the most experienced in this area, and I wouldn't know who is doing the robotic. Maybe open will be a bit more painful, but I'm pretty confident I'll come out ok. Also, on open surgery he doesn't go thru the peritoneal cavity...the robot does. I just feel better knowing a competant surgeon with 30+ years of experience is handling it. And, as the Mod says, I really dont want to waste any more time. I'll post my decision and the outcome when I know it. I appreciate all the input i can get.",

      "Content": "Hey, thanks for all your input! I may talk to a rad onc next week, just to be sure but at this point I'm leaning towards the open surgery. We DO have robotic available to us here but my Dr doesn't do it. I do know he is the most experienced in this area, and I wouldn't know who is doing the robotic. Maybe open will be a bit more painful, but I'm pretty confident I'll come out ok. Also, on open surgery he doesn't go thru the peritoneal cavity...the robot does. I just feel better knowing a competant surgeon with 30+ years of experience is handling it. And, as the Mod says, I really dont want to waste any more time. I'll post my decision and the outcome when I know it. I appreciate all the input i can get.",
