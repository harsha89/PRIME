      "Content": "I m new to the forum with a question I am having trouble getting feedback on. I got an infection, presumptive dx epididymitis, after Calypso beacon implantation.I am on my fifth day of Levaquin of a two week rx. Implantation was on 8/1 with scrotal fullness and right testicular discomfort several days later. On 8/10-11 temp rose to 100.8 and went to normal after 2-3 days antibiotic and early tylenol. Only minor discomfort remains. I am concerned that getting radiation as scheduled on 8/17 is an invitation to problems I would be less likely to suffer if I were to wait for 4-7 more days. Does anyone have feedback on this?",
