      "Content": "I finally convinced my VA pcp that I wanted a PSA test done because I will be 55 this year. On Aug 11th, my PSA level was 11.7, did a urinalysis that day all negative and normal. pCP did a DRE and said nothing abnormal or enlarged. Aug 24th I did a second PSA and this one went down to 7.7. I do have frequency of urination issues and having to urinate immediately at times. I have initial appointment with Urologist on September 12th. Question is why would my PSA go down that much in 2 weeks with no apparent infection?",
