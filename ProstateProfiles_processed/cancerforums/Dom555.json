Before Xmas his psa was 4 and has now jumped to 33. He's had a uti which was very painful and he has a very high pain barrier . His gp tried to perform the rectal exam however this was very painful. He has been urinating more frequently at night and reports problems with the flow of urine. Can anyone tell me whether he's more likely to have this as we r waiting for an appointment with the urologist but the wait is killing us",
