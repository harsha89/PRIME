      "Content": "New to forum, 68 year old here. After many years PSA running up slowly from 1.4 to 3.2, in 2014 at 3.5, and in 2015 4.7. Moved to new state and did not get PSA test until 06/08/2017 which came in at 8.8. Primary Dr referred me to URO who rechecked PSA and came back as 9.88. DRE at that time was normal, but URO recommended biopsy which I had done on 08/15/2017. Received call from URO on 08/21/2017 asking me to come in to review results from biopsy. Results from biopsy were (see signature for full report) I did indeed have PCa. Good news was that all cores came back at 3+3=6. Areas of concern were that PSA was 9.88, 9 of 12 cores were positive, tumor involvement ran from 10-95%, and have family history of PCa. He stated that while we might not be in a big rush to do anything, we needed to come up with some plan for the future. Spent the next hour discussing and explaining AS, surgery, and radiation. Thought he did an excellent job in explaining them all, giving me names of what he thought were excellent Dr in each field, and did not seem to pushing any one over the other. Told him of the options given, at that time I was leaning toward AS or surgery. Again he stated that we did not have to make decision immediately and that he would like to run an OncotypeDx test which might make decisions easier. Told us it would take around 2 weeks to hear back on OncotypeDx and that would give my wife and I time to think about choices available before meeting with him again. So that is where we are now. Have spent a great deal of time talking to other Pca patients about thier choice of treatment and outcomes, reading what I can find on internet,,and of course spent hours here seeing what other guys thoughts and results are. This is where I start feeling like that squirrel trying to cross a busy street. Do I stay where I am keeping an eye on everything, or make a dash across the street and hope I don't get hit. My thought process to this point has me running in one direction, and then just as quickly heading of in another direction. You guys and gals seem to have excellent insight, so hopefully you can see something in reports to date that might get me headed in the right direction. Thanks, Denny",

      "Content": "New to forum, 68 year old here. After many years PSA running up slowly from 1.4 to 3.2, in 2014 at 3.5, and in 2015 4.7. Moved to new state and did not get PSA test until 06/08/2017 which came in at 8.8. Primary Dr referred me to URO who rechecked PSA and came back as 9.88. DRE at that time was normal, but URO recommended biopsy which I had done on 08/15/2017. Received call from URO on 08/21/2017 asking me to come in to review results from biopsy. Results from biopsy were (see signature for full report) I did indeed have PCa. Good news was that all cores came back at 3+3=6. Areas of concern were that PSA was 9.88, 9 of 12 cores were positive, tumor involvement ran from 10-95%, and have family history of PCa. He stated that while we might not be in a big rush to do anything, we needed to come up with some plan for the future. Spent the next hour discussing and explaining AS, surgery, and radiation. Thought he did an excellent job in explaining them all, giving me names of what he thought were excellent Dr in each field, and did not seem to pushing any one over the other. Told him of the options given, at that time I was leaning toward AS or surgery. Again he stated that we did not have to make decision immediately and that he would like to run an OncotypeDx test which might make decisions easier. Told us it would take around 2 weeks to hear back on OncotypeDx and that would give my wife and I time to think about choices available before meeting with him again. So that is where we are now. Have spent a great deal of time talking to other Pca patients about thier choice of treatment and outcomes, reading what I can find on internet,,and of course spent hours here seeing what other guys thoughts and results are. This is where I start feeling like that squirrel trying to cross a busy street. Do I stay where I am keeping an eye on everything, or make a dash across the street and hope I don't get hit. My thought process to this point has me running in one direction, and then just as quickly heading of in another direction. You guys and gals seem to have excellent insight, so hopefully you can see something in reports to date that might get me headed in the right direction. Thanks, Denny",
