      "Content": "Not good. 5 positive cores, 4 Gleason 6 (3+3) and 1 Gleason 7 (3+4), all on the right side. I'll add the detail to the signature later. While driving home I was able to book an appointment at Cleveland Clinic on May 10th with Dr. Berglund. Will be having everything, including pathology slides sent to Cleveland tomorrow when Virginia Urology opens. I'm also going to book an appointment with a well regarded local radiation oncologist, and at the Proton therapy center in Hampton, which is about 45 minutes away from us to cover all our options. I'm FURIOUS that there was a 9 month delay to biopsy after the MRI. The MRI wasn't a false negative, it wasn't interpreted by their radiologist - they simply accepted the interpretation of a hospitalist radiologist in a 43 year old man with a PSA density of .5. While I know it doesn't make a difference in how advanced the cancer is, it makes the treatment timing very difficult given our personal circumstances. However I'm grateful that his PCP did a PSA test at 42, because if he had waited till 50, this could be catastrophic. I'm also so thankful that my job provides EXCELLENT health insurance that includes CC in-network AND would cover Proton therapy.",

All DREs have been negative, and at 22cc, it seems his prostate is quite small for any type of BPH issue. Zero urinary or sexual symptoms, he occasionally reports a sensation of \"pressure\" in the region though and has a history of lower back pain. I'm frustrated that over 6 months went by between the MRI and a reading by their internal radiologist, and that they have consistently denied requests for anything beyond PSA & % free PSA tests. And that the MRI was read with a PI RADs 3 in January and we weren't given the results until the end of March. I know that prostate cancer is typically slow growing, but because of his age I feel they should have had a greater sense of urgency. Not to mention this has been hanging over our heads for over a year! Nothing to do now but keep our fingers crossed for the biopsy results I guess.",

But, I agree with your direction of consulting with different specialists. It is extremely important to select the best primary treatment , and not allow one specialist to describe a different treatment. BTW, where in VA are you? I am in Alexandria, and within driving distance to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. We're in the Richmond/Williamsburg area - Hopkins was an option, but our PCP said he prefers Cleveland, so that's where we're headed first.",
