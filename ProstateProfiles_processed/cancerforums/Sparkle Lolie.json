A search reveals over 38% of the general population in the US will be diagnosed with a cancer at some time in their lives. These statistic are available for specific types of cancer as well and are available for the UK. Developing prostate cancer for men is 11.5% and dying of it is 1 in 41 or 2.45%. These numbers are increasing. An average age group, statiscally, to approach a rate of 3% is 25-49 which has a 3.8% rate. You must live in a very young community or a 3% rate may indicate a less than average rate of cancer screening. Your local healthcare group may be revealing a less than average rate of cancer screening rather than a high level of proactive care. Or, your community may be a statistical cancer healthy anomally. Lifetime risk is different from the risk at any given age, though. Age is one of the biggest risk factors for cancer in general. Like you, I'm curious about how a practice would quantify an individual's risk. The inability to do that is one of the major problems with national screening campaigns, so if someone has come up with a method to calculate individual risk they need to be publishing their work because it's a game-changer.",
