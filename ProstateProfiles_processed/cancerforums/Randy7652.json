      "Content": "Please excuse posting across different boards but I am new to this. Hello everyone, New to this forum and also newly diagnosed with prostate cancer with 8 of 14 cores positive, 3-4 and 4-3s. Looks like surgery is in my future and am looking for the most skilled Dr. Which leads me to a question....does a high number of surgeries equal a skilled doctor. I have been seeing Leslie Deane at Rush and have scheduled a visit with Dr Zagaja at UC for a consultation. My concern/question is whether a doc who does a high number surgeries could get complacent. From what I can discern, Dr Deane has done over 250 and performs about 1 per week. Dr. Zagaja- several thousand. Also, what % of the surgery they actually do or if a resident performs a part of it? As of now, I know Dr Deane would do the complete surgery himself. I\u0092m just not sure of Zagaja. Any thoughts on either of these Drs. would be greatly appreciated.",
