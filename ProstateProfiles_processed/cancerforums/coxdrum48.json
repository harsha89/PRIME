I'm talking to the oncologists about starting ADT and salvage radiation. In their terms they are \"throwing the book\" at the cancer. I expressed my reservations about ADT to the medical oncologists and she just said \"we can't make you take it\". She had had a long day and i was her last patient. She had been seeing \"really sick people\" before me snd was 1.5 hours late. How bad is the rising PSA in tge scheme of things?",

After 2 months of ADT I'll begin the 8 weeks of Radiation. I'm 61 for the record. Fully continent. I'm at Memorial Sloan Kettering. I thought they were supposed to be really good. They were my third opinion before my surgery. Nobody seems to be in any big hurry there though. I get so many different reactions from people about the seriousness of my situation. It's confusing. Well, I'm on my way now.",

I'm talking to the oncologists about starting ADT and salvage radiation. In their terms they are \"throwing the book\" at the cancer. I expressed my reservations about ADT to the medical oncologists and she just said \"we can't make you take it\". She had had a long day and i was her last patient. She had been seeing \"really sick people\" before me snd was 1.5 hours late. How bad is the rising PSA in tge scheme of things?",
