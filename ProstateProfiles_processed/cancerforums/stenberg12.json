You could then try PM the posters to see if they will give you a reply or update. By the way, there were reports that it worked better than Taxotere. Good luck. Newporter; Thanks for the response. My Dad just had his first treatment last Friday. He is not feeling well. His psa is over 2000. We're lucky we still have him. Still can't find much on this new chemo- jevtana. Hoping it works. I'm new to this so I did'nt understand the PM or posters you suggested. Thanks for the help.",
