      "Content": "I'm 54 and completely asymptomatic. I did have urine retention in March which necessitated a Foley catheter (prior history of cauda equina and back surgery to fix it), but that was an isolated incident and has not been a problem since. According to the urologist I saw after, it is unlikely that it was related to the cancer as all returned to normal after the catheter was pulled. They did the PSA this month as a precaution after waiting 8 weeks from pulling the catheter. Prior PSA about 10 years ago was under 1, a DRE in 2013 was normal, and there is no history of prostate cancer in my family. The result of the PSA test was a complete surprise to everyone, including my urologist. Other than surgeries for vertebral issues in the past I am in pretty good health and returned to normal activities after those surgeries. Current urologist has it staged at T2c, but will let the docs in Boston look at the new scans and figure it out. Looks like Thursday will be a big day.",

Mine was non-robotic so the doc went a different route and had me drink magnesium citrate, which is usually prescribed prior to a colonoscopy, around 4 in the afternoon the day before. Certainly not pleasant, but it didn't require an enema in the middle of the night either. This was followed by clear fluids up until midnight. The weekend before we went out to dinner and had a couple of bottles of nice wine in anticipation of getting to the other side. My recovery so far has been fairly easy too. You'll be happy to have it done and then get out and go walking. Best of luck on Monday.",

      "Content": "Ron- You'll be amazed how quickly this goes. I had mine two weeks and two days ago, and yes the anticipation was kind of a drag. Mine was non-robotic so the doc went a different route and had me drink magnesium citrate, which is usually prescribed prior to a colonoscopy, around 4 in the afternoon the day before. Certainly not pleasant, but it didn't require an enema in the middle of the night either. This was followed by clear fluids up until midnight. The weekend before we went out to dinner and had a couple of bottles of nice wine in anticipation of getting to the other side. My recovery so far has been fairly easy too. You'll be happy to have it done and then get out and go walking. Best of luck on Monday.",

      "Content": "They pulled the catheter this morning. That was relatively uneventful, but it feels really good to be walking around without having to carry a bag or strap one to my leg. So far that's been going pretty well, with little leakage. We reviewed the path lab results with the doctor also. The good news is that the 14 lymph nodes that they pulled were all negative. Not so good news is the fact that it escaped the capsule and infiltrated the seminal vesicles. Gleason was confirmed at 7 (4+3) with 5% tertiary 8 (5+3). Stage is T3B, N0, M0. First PSA test will dictate where we go from here. Mike",

Here's why: a week ago Friday, December 19th, my 18 year old came home from college with soreness in his neck and periodic vomiting. He had no other unusual symptoms. My wife took him to the hospital and eventually they did a CT scan. They found a mass in his temporal lobe, almost 6 months to the day of my diagnosis. On the 21st, they took out a 5 cm tumor that we just found out to be Grade IV Glioblastoma, which was certainly not what we were hoping for. The doctor was able to get most of it, my son has retained full function with no issues, and he made it home for Christmas, which was great. Now the challenge of how to attack it with chemo and radiation begins. Coming on top of my diagnosis in June, this has really made this the 6 months from hell. 2016 has got to be better.",

      "Content": "I would talk to your RO and MO about doing a short course of ADT in conjunction with the radiation. Though my Gleason score wasn't as high as yours, my PSA 12 weeks post surgery was close to BCR, so they gave me a 3 month shot of Lupron in November to weaken anything that may be lurking. I start radiation today and get the second Lupron shot next week. My MO said that the second shot next week will be my last until after they can get a PSA reading after radiation and after the Lupron has left my system.",

Normally, the primary care people start you off with PT, then if that doesn't help they send you for an MRI to see if there's something that needs to be addressed. Mine were both emergency situations, so PT wouldn't have helped me anyway. Stretching and flexibility exercises like yoga can sometimes help. Mike",

There's a pharma company in England (GW Pharmaceuticals) which has shown positive results with this mix (though theirs is proprietary) in Phase II controlled studies for GBM, but the cohorts were really small.

At the end of the day, what matters is what happens when they do the surgery and prepare the path report. Some cancers are upgraded, while others get downgraded and it all depends on your particular case. I went through this with the various nomograms on the net and finally decided to just talk to the oncology team treating me, to find out what they thought, since they deal with it daily. While my initial post-surgery testing wasn't optimal (approaching BCR), we all anticipated this going into the surgery (they didn't sugarcoat it) and I know i am in the right hands with the approach being taken. For today, try to put it out of your mind and enjoy a nice Thanksgiving dinner. Mike",

Trying to re-do my diet and eat better with less refined sugars. Then I went out for a 1 mile walk, and had the first post surgery BM, which was a relief. Feel really good right now, aside from a little discomfort from the incisions. Took my last dose of Tylenol around 3 on Thursday morning while I was having gas cramps. Was just about to head out for another walk, but it's pouring so have to wait on that. Will keep you all posted as things progress.",

      "Content": "Had a laparoscopic (non-robot version) done on Tuesday the 21st at MGH in Boston. They told us to show up at 10:30, but the pre-op area was swamped. I went in there at 12:45 and was getting prepped by the anesthesiologist by 1:15. He missed one of the veins the first time, which was a little bit of a pain since when he pulled the needle I was bleeding everywhere. This was the only hiccup all day. Wheeled me in about 1:45, shuffled me onto the table told me to say goodnight and the next thing I knew it was about 5:00 in the recovery room. Moved me upstairs at 7, had me up walking at 9. Tried to sleep, but way too many disturbances (medical helicopter; vital signs; changing IV bags) to get anything more than about 3 hours. Started passing gas in the middle of the night which made the nurses happy. Docs came in at 7 to say everything went fine and I would probably be going home. They had me up walking at 8, 10 & 12. Pulled the drain about 1:15 and sent me home around 3. Had some CO2 gas pains last night periodically, but they subsided around 5, so ended with about 7 hours sleep, which isn't too bad. The most uncomfortable part about this has been the laparoscopic incisions, but even those aren't so bad - I've been only taking Tylenol since it was done. All in all this has not been that bad. Compared to two laminectomy spine surgeries, which resulted in my coming home with a catheter each time (and some serious nerve pain), this has been a walk in the park. Yes, the catheter is a PIA, but it is manageable. Looking forward to getting it pulled and getting the results of the Path Lab report. Mike",

If you read the comments from the panel, as well as the editorial I didn't post from the guy who's the head of the American Cancer Society, it is still very discouraging. They keep talking about \"false positives\", additional testing, as in biopsies without an MRI, a \"screening frenzy\", and aggressive treatment for cases such as a G6. You would think based on what was written here that all of the doctors that request PSA tests have absolutely no clue what they are doing. Mike",

      "Content": "In May, Keytruda was approved by FDA for use in solid tumors throughout the body which have specific genetic defects affecting a DNA mismatch repair gene. There is a growing body of evidence that certain types of prostate cancer have a specific protein, PDL-1, which blocks the mismatch repair gene and prevents the damaged DNA from being repaired. This protein is blocked by the Keytruda, which is supposed to stop the cancer cells from multiplying. For PC, it is generally used in combination with something like Xtandi.",
