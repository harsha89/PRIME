The decaf gave me more problems than the regular coffee. Go figure. Glad you are doing so well, increase your activity slowly and you will continue. Ray",

My experience with Florida Hospital was exceptional. Dr Patel has performed over 8,000 RAPs. My recovery has been amazing also. I am at 5 weeks out, back to full activities, dry (no pads) and cath was removed after 4 days. It was well worth the drive. I'm sure someone will respond with info from Mayo but thought you might like other options. Good Luck Ray",

      "Content": "For anyone needing a little help with their little buddy, here's the scoop. To help figure out the dosage, the Doc gave me the first shot in the office of 20 units (NOT CCs) a very tiny amount. I was amazed that there was no pain due to the Very tiny needle used. And I mean no pain at all. His instructions were very clear and simple as to how to use the stuff. Within 10 minutes I was fluffy and little buddy was looking his old self again but not a useable erection for penetration. So next day at home I increased amount to 30 units and got semi erect and usable although nothing to brag about. The next attempt will be at 40 units and that should do the trick. Each vial has about 4-6 injections worth of Trimix. 5 vials cost about $80.00. CAUTION, the stuff is very short dated and has a short shelf life (6weeks) and must be kept refrigerated. To increase the shelf life, I draw up the needed amount and freeze the syringes per the Dr and the compounder. By the way, I gave myself the second shot without so much as a blink, so if this is your worry, forget it. I find it well worth the work. The erection comes in about 10 - 20 minutes and can last for about an hour depending on the dosage you use. Don't get carried away. Ray",

      "Content": "Mas, I got this from a products web site. It is pretty close as to what my instructions were from the Doc. DO NOT over pump the unit. Pain is a sign you are over doing it. I found it to be of no help, but that is just me. If your insurance wont cover it get one from an adult toy store, about $30. I have both and they work about the same. Good Luck Ray 3.After coating the inside of the cylinder and your penis with lubricant, insertthe penis into thecylinder so that it is lying along the bottom. Lubrication helps obtain theseal necessary to createa vacuum and allows the penis to slide easily inside the cylinder. Use onlywater based lubricant. 4.Position the cylinder over the penis, and place it firmly against the body tobegin. In order to getan air tight seal, do not allow air to enter the end of the cylinder pressedagainst your body. 5.Hold the cylinder in place and begin the pumping action by squeezing the handleon the pump.The pump will stop automatically when no pressure is applied tot he handle. 6.Operate the pump slowly. Squeeze the handle and slowly count for 3-5 seconds.Next stop squeezing,the vacuum will stop, and again count for 3-5 seconds. It is this procedurethat drawsblood from your body filling your penis creating an erection. Repeat. DO NOT RUSH THIS PART OF THE PROCEDURE. 7.As blood is drawn into the penis, a stretching sensation will be felt as thepenis enlarges. Discomfortcan be expected during the first few uses. Once the penis fills with as muchblood as itcan hold, STOP! Somemen find that with the erection obtained using the VED®, the penis is wider,feels slightly cool, may appear darker, has prominentveins, and/or pivots at the base. These are all normal responses when usingvacuum constriction. DIRECTIONSFOR VED THERAPY We recommend that men practice using the VED® toachieve a firm erection daily for at least two weeks before using it for intercourse. Withcontinued practice, the length of time needed to achieve an erection will decrease, and the firmnessof the erection will improve. This will also give your penis time to adjust to being filled withblood again. VED Therapy isa daily exercise to pull blood into the penis.

      "Content": "Mary, although a 6.9 is high for his age, there are other things that can spike the PSA, prostatitis being one of them. Keep in mind that PCa does not always have any symptoms. Did he have a negative DRE, did the Urologist try antibiotics? A little more history would be helpful although he has already had the biopsy and that should help with decisions. As D&K mentioned, get the book and read the stickies at the start of the forum and feel free to ask us what you wish. many others will chime in shortly and mention those things that I didn't. Good luck Ray",

I bought one package of Depends mens pull up type and one package of thin shields. I have half of each left. I only used the pullups for the 1st week after the cath was pulled and then the shields for another 2 weeks at the rate of one shield per day (kegles before surgery really helped). The shields are so thin he could fold up two and stick them in his pocket, no problem. With his age and conditioning I would not be surprised if he didn't use just one and for just a couple of weeks. Good luck to you both, let us know how it goes and any other questions. Ray PS; The only must have for home after the surgery is a supportive wife and it looks like he already has that.",

      "Content": "All good advice from my fellow club members. Definitely get another Urologist, check online for patient reviews ( Healthgrades or Vitals). Don't be overly concerned about the biopsy, they seldom cause problems but can save your life. Life expectancy can be somewhat the same if you don't treat prostate cancer, that is if you only have a life expectancy of less than 10 years. You are only 65, I am 66 and plan on living many years past 76, especially now that I have had the cancer removed with robotic surgery. I have never met anyone thus far that has \"catastrophic\" side effects from surgery. But I have dealt with patients that have had a horrible death from metastasized prostate cancer. Your cancer, your decision. Good Luck Ray",

As for the VA treatment, it has been my experience that what you experienced is fairly normal today. Until all vets are allowed to seek outside treatment through Tricare this will continue to be the case. While there are many good Doctors in the VA system, it has always been a place for bad Doctors to hide. That being said, hopefully you will connect with a good surgeon with much experience in open or robotic surgery and get things going. Good luck and have fun in Aruba (great island). Ray",

      "Content": "I'm with fairwind on the piece of cake analogy. Read the. RP sticky for more info. You are going to one of the best in the field for his surgery. Try not to over fret the details. All should go very smoothly. The first day is uncomfortable but not what I considered painful. You need to start walking now. Get yourself into the best shape possible. Your catheter will just be an inconvenience. Many of us did not use the leg bag as it is a pain in the ass. I hung the large bag off the side of my box spring and slept from day one in my own bed. Others kept the bag in a bucket by the bed or slept in a recliner. Only you can make that determination. Hydrate and walk---lots. He will not have a bowel for about 4-5 days and it will be reason for your first celebration. The cath will come out shortly thereafter (second celebration). Not to worry about cath removal, just feels weird, no pain. Then comes celebration number 3 when you get your pathology saying all cancer contained and removed. Don't buy too many pull ups or pads, one pack of each should be enough. I was dry after 3 weeks and am now at week 12. It would be nice to have someone home for the first 4-5 days but not necessary after day 2 (my experience only). This is a process, but not one that has no end. Just follow Drs. instructions, ask questions and hang in there and all will be fine. Good Luck Ray",

Because there was PNI (perineural invasion) I was told by 2 Docs that active surveillance should be avoided as the cancer is a little more aggressive than the gleason score suggests. Dr Su at Shands will give me the third and final opinion in two weeks. He is the head of the Urology robotics program and one of the best in Florida. If not for the PNI, They all agree that the active surveillance would be the best course. Johns Hopkins agrees with this standard. Oh, and my PSA is 6.7. Spiked from 4.2 in 3 months.",

Hope you got the female nurse you wanted. Mine was a male nurse. I have been on Trimix now for two years with mixed results, probably due to the added problem of Peyronies disease. I did learn a trick or two though that I thought I would share. The stuff is expensive and has a short shelf life unless frozen, which is what my Dr and pharmacist recommend. What I do is knock the top of the vial off. The aluminum top is very soft. Then draw up your dosage into the syringes and freeze them then defrost as needed. This allows you to get every last drop and at least a 6 month freezer life. The syringes thaw very quickly. All this info is backed by my Uro and the compounder FYI. Hope you are well Ray",

Because there was PNI (perineural invasion) I was told by 2 Docs that active surveillance should be avoided as the cancer is a little more aggressive than the gleason score suggests. Dr Su at Shands will give me the third and final opinion in two weeks. He is the head of the Urology robotics program and one of the best in Florida. If not for the PNI, They all agree that the active surveillance would be the best course. Johns Hopkins agrees with this standard. Oh, and my PSA is 6.7. Spiked from 4.2 in 3 months.",

      "Content": "Welcome to the other side and congrats on the downgrade. As far as what to expect, everyone is different and everyone will give you a different story. So with that, with me, the urge to pee was noticeable right away. I worked hard on the kegals but did not over do them. I wore pull ups for one week and pads for two more weeks. I was pretty much dry at 3 1/2 weeks but wore thin shields when out to dinner or on prolonged trips as we were on a two week trip to Alaska. No need to weigh your pads, you will know how you are doing. I believe a lot depends on what shape you are in going in and coming out of surgery. I have only worn two shields in the past 4 weeks and I am 12 weeks out from surgery. Don't be surprised if you sneeze or exert yourself and forget your kegal squeeze and leak a little. it will happen. But it will be less and less till you don't think about it. So good luck and again congrats. Ray",

Think of it as taking the dog for a walk, except with your pecker. Look forward to that one time, when the cath comes out, that your wife won't mind some stranger handling your man parts because that will be the last time. Don't overbuy diapers or pads because you probably won't need many after the first few weeks. get out of the pads asap and switch to dribble shields during the day and nothing at night if possible. Have lots of weekend sex, play the sympathy card. and above all be patient and follow your docs directions. Good Luck Ray",

      "Content": "Welcome to the club Mj, sorry you have to be here, but congrats on having a 3+3=6 Gleason and making the decision as to treatment. I say congrats because if the G6 holds up, you are on your way to a complete cure beginning November 13th. That will be the day you join the other side. Try not to stress too much between now and then, although we all did. If you read the stickie about Davinci surgery, you will notice most of us had very positive results and positive things to say about the procedure. I just had my 2nd PSA drawn and have a zero PSA. Now is the time to get your self into the best shape you can, have as much sympathy sex as possible and don't go crazy buying the things you think you will need or you will end up throwing much away. A pillow for the car trip home, one pack of mens pull-ups (I liked Depends pull-ups), one pack of pads. After the catheter came out I used the pull-ups for 1 week. I was dry at night after 3 weeks and switched to pads then shields at that time. I was 100% continent at 6 weeks. Everyone recovers at a different pace so do not get discouraged. Feel free to ask any questions you have and keep us up to date. Good Luck Ray PS: Where are you having surgery?",

      "Content": "Welcome wife3. Oshguy gives good info. My surgery was May 1st. first PSA 6 weeks out. No staples but the usual time for removal is 7-10 days. He should stop the Tylenol as soon as he feels comfortable. I also did not use any pain meds after surgery. Drink plenty of fluids ( no caffeine if possible). Blood in urine can last several weeks, NO heavy lifting for 4-6 weeks depending on Doctor. Once catheter comes out he will feel 100% better. Move from diapers to pads as soon as the leakage slows to a reasonable rate. And most important, keep his spirits up with the support you are showing by this post. Feel free to ask anything. Good Luck Ray",

So far they are working well. Don't be afraid of the word injection as the needle is VERY small and the area of injection has very little feeling. Once you do it , it becomes very easy. That is not to say that this is the only treatment but just one that I am using. They may have other options in the UK, but you must talk with the experts. Good Luck Ray",

As the others have stated, it is very important to know how many Davinci surgerys your Doc has done. Mine did over 8000. There is a high learning curve for this procedure. My local Urologist had done only 95 and told me he would refer me to one of the big dogs if I wanted. And I wanted. My results have been excellent and I attribute that to the skill level of my surgeon. Read the stickies, ask questions and find the right person to do the procedure and you will be on the other side before you know it. Ray",

      "Content": "Stuart, Try not to get to far ahead of yourself. So far no cancer has been detected, hopefully it stays that way. Download or purchase Dr Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. It will give you much information on Gleason scores, staging, questions to ask your surgeon and options for treatment. While your PSA is climbing at a fast rate, there are other reasons that could be the cause. I don't know of any surgeon that would remove the prostate to reduce the chances of cancer. Prostate cancer in generally very slow growing and with correct medical follow up can be caught early and treated successfully. Read some of the stickies on the first page of the forum and let us know when you get your results. Good luck Ray",

      "Content": "Welcome John to the club. As you can see, you will get plenty of advice and comments and answers to any questions you might have. Read the stickies, get the Walsh book and keep asking away. My two cents; at your age and a G6, I'm with Chuck, get it out. Make sure your Doc has done many, my guy did over 8000, robotic procedures, get a second opinion on the read, although it will probably confirm what you already know and finally make a decision based on what your gut tells you. I am now 10 weeks out and 67 years old. I had been troubled with BPH for many years before the Ca diagnosis. I was dry (no incontinence) by the third week after surgery and now feel pretty much like my old self except for the ED issue. With nerve sparing surgery there is a chance of regaining sexual function but I am not counting on it. Wife and I have learned to be quite creative. Hopefully that will not be an issue for you, but be prepared. Please keep us informed and good luck. Ray",

Had a friend with this problem couple weeks ago and he just told me how well it worked. DO NOT use Neosporin for rashes or wounds unless infection is present.

As the others have stated, it is very important to know how many Davinci surgerys your Doc has done. Mine did over 8000. There is a high learning curve for this procedure. My local Urologist had done only 95 and told me he would refer me to one of the big dogs if I wanted. And I wanted. My results have been excellent and I attribute that to the skill level of my surgeon. Read the stickies, ask questions and find the right person to do the procedure and you will be on the other side before you know it. Ray",

He should stop the Tylenol as soon as he feels comfortable. I also did not use any pain meds after surgery. Drink plenty of fluids ( no caffeine if possible). Blood in urine can last several weeks, NO heavy lifting for 4-6 weeks depending on Doctor. Once catheter comes out he will feel 100% better. Move from diapers to pads as soon as the leakage slows to a reasonable rate. And most important, keep his spirits up with the support you are showing by this post. Feel free to ask anything.

      "Content": "Tmack, Not sure if the article below helps but it seems to imply that you are in good shape as far as a cure is concerned. It has been said that Gleeson 6 cells cannot live outside the prostate, so if you truly are a G6 that would be good news. Let us know what your Uro. plans and good luck. Ray In other news, Epstein and colleagues recently took a closer look at the behavior of Gleason score 6 prostate cancer; their findings were published in the American Journal of Surgical Pathology. Although Gleason score 6 cancer is considered slow-growing and not aggressive, it has been found \u2013 rarely \u2013 in studies of prostate specimens after radical prostatectomy, to have spread outside the prostate. Could Gleason 6 cancer ever spread to the pelvic lymph nodes? Good news: The answer is no. \"We performed a search of the radical prostatectomy databases at four large academic centers,\" says Epstein. \"In more than 14,000 radical prostatectomies, there was not a single case of a Gleason score 6 tumor ever spreading to lymph nodes.\" It takes a Gleason score of 7 or higher for prostate cancer to become aggressive enough to spread far beyond the prostate. Under the microscope, Gleason score 6 cells appear uniform, \"and they have a more predictable, excellent prognosis,\" Epstein notes. Gleason score 6 disease has such a good reputation as being \"indolent\" \u2013 slow-growing and wellbehaved, as cancers go \u2013 among pathologists that some of them have questioned whether it should still be considered cancer. Yes it should, Epstein says. One important reason why is that the biopsy Gleason score is often adjusted after radical prostatectomy, when the prostate is studied by a pathologist, \"because the biopsy often underestimates disease grade and extent.\" Also, \"if men think that Gleason 6 tumors are not cancer, this could result in a missed opportunity for cure.\"",

As for the increase in cores, based on what I know from my Doctors, it is not at all unusual to find additional cores on a follow-up biopsy. I'm not a Doctor but I would be more concerned with the Gleason score than the amount of cores. Better to be a 6 than an 8. Four months before your RP seems about right for a busy top notch surgeon.

      "Content": "Welcome John to the club. As you can see, you will get plenty of advice and comments and answers to any questions you might have. Read the stickies, get the Walsh book and keep asking away. My two cents; at your age and a G6, I'm with Chuck, get it out. Make sure your Doc has done many, my guy did over 8000, robotic procedures, get a second opinion on the read, although it will probably confirm what you already know and finally make a decision based on what your gut tells you. I am now 10 weeks out and 67 years old. I had been troubled with BPH for many years before the Ca diagnosis. I was dry (no incontinence) by the third week after surgery and now feel pretty much like my old self except for the ED issue. With nerve sparing surgery there is a chance of regaining sexual function but I am not counting on it. Wife and I have learned to be quite creative. Hopefully that will not be an issue for you, but be prepared. Please keep us informed and good luck. Ray",

Would you be second guessing your decision if after surgery your pathology comes back with a breach of the wall? I know I would. Mine is coming out in 2 weeks and that wasn't soon enough as far as I was concerned. The best decision is the one you and only you are going to be most comfortable with.

      "Content": "Ajna, Having worked in a radiology dept. for 20 years, generally non-specific changes are a good thing as Chuck mentioned. Cancers, fractures and other pathologies are generally easy to observe and classify. That being said, occasionally a non-specific reading can turn out to be one of these. With the low PSA and no definite tumor seen, it is too early to panic. Try to relax until you get the results of the team study, then let us know the results. Good Luck Ray",

I know a week can seem a long way away, but for any of us to make negative or positive predictions would only add to your anxiety. If you want to get more information on Prostate Cancer and it's diagnosis and treatment read Dr. Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. Many of us recommend this book to new members of the group. After the biopsy results let us know the results and we will help answer your many questions. Good Luck Ray",

Compared to other options, side effects can be greater, longer lasting and can occur many months later. Having worked with low dose radiation for 20 years I would not be convinced to have it placed in my body. With prostate surgery if there is a recurrence of PC, radiation is a salvage option. If PC returns after brachytherapy surgery can be very difficult. The following link will give you some information from Johns Hopkins, the leaders in the field.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DavefromMD I had ED before I had an RP in May 2017. I was taking no medication for it. There has been no progress on the ED since the surgery and sensitivity is less (which I expected). I started taking Cialis when we wanted to see if things were getting better and then Viagra. I was taking it on an \"as needed\" basis, not daily. Neither had any effect. I was wondering if any of you on here had ED before surgery and what your ED recovery experience was. Dave, I also had ED prior to surgery as well as Peyronies. The Doc said right out front that post surgery would be as bad or worse. It was worse. I found that the trimix shots were my only alternative and they have worked quite well since finding the correct dosage. The shot is pretyy much painless and the price is fine. Hope this helps. Ray",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jeri so my husbands surgery went well on October 27 . Pathology report says more cancer than initially thought but it was confined. First PSA test today was 0.04. That's good, right? What number should we start worrying about if it gets higher. I could ask Dr. these questions but that's not for a week - Thank you - Jeri from Vancouver (ps - still lots of uncontrollable bladder - he's very frustrated about that - especially now thats hes going back to work Feb 9) Jeri, a0.04 would indeed be good. Anything under <0.1 is usually considered undetectable. The < (less than) sign being very important. Looks like hubby is on his way to a complete cure. Can you share his pathology report? As for his bladder problems, he needs to hang in there and keep up the kagels but not to overdo. See the sticky on this. Continence can take anywhere from weeks to many months and sometimes requires intervention, although that is rare. The other guys will chime in shortly and give their ideas. Good luck Ray",

You will be getting many opinions very shortly from this great group. Hopefully these will help with your decision. Good Luck Ray",
