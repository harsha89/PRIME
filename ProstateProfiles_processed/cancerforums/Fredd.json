      "Content": "@Ron, I'm in QLD. @HighlanderCFH, OK thanks for that reassurance. I think they said the 3+4 comment in my case as it was a guided biopsy on one small area and could have been the other way around. My wife is a little concerned but I've basically said to her and I hope this is correct, that this is not something that is going to go away, it may grow slow or it may grow faster but grow it is certainly going to do and it's likely that if it escapes the prostate as it will probably do within 10 years I'm going to be in some serious trouble. My urologist was confident in doing the op but he does not specialise only in prostate. However he introduced me to another specialist who does specialise in this and is experienced on the Da Vinci or the Play Station as he likes to call it, and he agreed with my decision to go with that due to the better visibility offered.",

      "Content": "About 2.5 years ago, I had a checkup and a PSA of 9.4 eventually after a year of putting it off I had an ultra sound that was 'suspicious', just a small 7mm lesion. Eventually after being talked into a guided MRI biopsy, it was confirmed that the small lesion was indeed cancerous and it returned a 3+4 score, but I've been told that that is not really much better than 4+3, at any rate it's intermediate. Had more whole body bone scans and it was determined that it has not escaped the prostate. Over the past 2.5 years the PSA has steadily but slowing increased to 12. I'm 60 years old and after an interview with the radiation oncologist I have determined that probably a prostatectomy may be in order. After much thinking and studying on this and talking with my urologists I have been offered an operation via the Da Vinci robot with an experienced surgeon with 500 operations on this machine. The lesion is near the side of the prostate but looks completely contained and I'm hoping to save both nerve bundles. I sort of get the impression that if I did nothing that this thing will probably escape the prostate in 6 years by which time I'll regret not having the op. So I've decided to go for it. I am of course concerned with the issue of incontinence which I've been told is in fact relatively low risk as I'm healthy and not overweight and the prostate is small. Then there's the nerve bundle thing. Am I making a wise choice to have the operation at this stage. thx.",

      "Content": "About 2.5 years ago, I had a checkup and a PSA of 9.4 eventually after a year of putting it off I had an ultra sound that was 'suspicious', just a small 7mm lesion. Eventually after being talked into a guided MRI biopsy, it was confirmed that the small lesion was indeed cancerous and it returned a 3+4 score, but I've been told that that is not really much better than 4+3, at any rate it's intermediate. Had more whole body bone scans and it was determined that it has not escaped the prostate. Over the past 2.5 years the PSA has steadily but slowing increased to 12. I'm 60 years old and after an interview with the radiation oncologist I have determined that probably a prostatectomy may be in order. After much thinking and studying on this and talking with my urologists I have been offered an operation via the Da Vinci robot with an experienced surgeon with 500 operations on this machine. The lesion is near the side of the prostate but looks completely contained and I'm hoping to save both nerve bundles. I sort of get the impression that if I did nothing that this thing will probably escape the prostate in 6 years by which time I'll regret not having the op. So I've decided to go for it. I am of course concerned with the issue of incontinence which I've been told is in fact relatively low risk as I'm healthy and not overweight and the prostate is small. Then there's the nerve bundle thing. Am I making a wise choice to have the operation at this stage. thx.",

PSA rose from 9 to 12 over period of 3 years. 4 months after surgery specialist told me that PSA was 0.02 in the lab where it was tested 0.008 is considered to be zero. The surgeon said he was 'surprised, but not alarmed', and made an appointment to see him in 3 months with a new PSA reading. Any comments on this? It sounded to me that he fully expected it to be effectively zero.",

      "Content": "@Ron, I'm in QLD. @HighlanderCFH, OK thanks for that reassurance. I think they said the 3+4 comment in my case as it was a guided biopsy on one small area and could have been the other way around. My wife is a little concerned but I've basically said to her and I hope this is correct, that this is not something that is going to go away, it may grow slow or it may grow faster but grow it is certainly going to do and it's likely that if it escapes the prostate as it will probably do within 10 years I'm going to be in some serious trouble. My urologist was confident in doing the op but he does not specialise only in prostate. However he introduced me to another specialist who does specialise in this and is experienced on the Da Vinci or the Play Station as he likes to call it, and he agreed with my decision to go with that due to the better visibility offered.",

      "Content": "About 2.5 years ago, I had a checkup and a PSA of 9.4 eventually after a year of putting it off I had an ultra sound that was 'suspicious', just a small 7mm lesion. Eventually after being talked into a guided MRI biopsy, it was confirmed that the small lesion was indeed cancerous and it returned a 3+4 score, but I've been told that that is not really much better than 4+3, at any rate it's intermediate. Had more whole body bone scans and it was determined that it has not escaped the prostate. Over the past 2.5 years the PSA has steadily but slowing increased to 12. I'm 60 years old and after an interview with the radiation oncologist I have determined that probably a prostatectomy may be in order. After much thinking and studying on this and talking with my urologists I have been offered an operation via the Da Vinci robot with an experienced surgeon with 500 operations on this machine. The lesion is near the side of the prostate but looks completely contained and I'm hoping to save both nerve bundles. I sort of get the impression that if I did nothing that this thing will probably escape the prostate in 6 years by which time I'll regret not having the op. So I've decided to go for it. I am of course concerned with the issue of incontinence which I've been told is in fact relatively low risk as I'm healthy and not overweight and the prostate is small. Then there's the nerve bundle thing. Am I making a wise choice to have the operation at this stage. thx.",

Initial psa around 2 then a year later almost 6. Biopsy and the rest is history. 4+3 in 2 sites and 2 other low risk sites as well. Bone scan and CT clear. I have talked with my urologist who is a good open surgeon but did reccomend I go see a radiation oncologist just to get all the info. Had a very good meeting for almost an hour but in some ways am more confused. I think each specialty has its own take and bias' on the mode of treatment. It has been very helpful to read some of the posts on the forum. I have another meeting with a surgeon who does do lap/robotic surgery next week to go over the surgical option. I am 48 and am still struggling with the idea of the whole thing. 3 kids and a great wife. Need to do what is the best long term solution. In British Columbia the cancer institute has some pretty good stats on the seed therapy. Any comments.",

      "Content": "You situation including the confusion and the advice given, even my urologist was a open surgery guy, is virtually identical to me, however as I was most concerned about nerves he agreed with the decision to go with another urologist he introduced me to (as I was in the 9public hospital system and the other specialist was next door at the time, thank the lord Australia is not like the USA in this regard, everything is publicly funded including the multiple bone scans and post op physio) as there was just a bit more precision involved. He said he felt confident doing it open but I went with the da vinci and you can read about it in my original thread Gotta say, glad I'm in Originally Posted by archersd Hello , my name is Steve and i was diagnosed with prostate cancer about an month ago. Initial psa around 2 then a year later almost 6. Biopsy and the rest is history. 4+3 in 2 sites and 2 other low risk sites as well. Bone scan and CT clear. I have talked with my urologist who is a good open surgeon but did reccomend I go see a radiation oncologist just to get all the info. Had a very good meeting for almost an hour but in some ways am more confused. I think each specialty has its own take and bias' on the mode of treatment. It has been very helpful to read some of the posts on the forum. I have another meeting with a surgeon who does do lap/robotic surgery next week to go over the surgical option. I am 48 and am still struggling with the idea of the whole thing. 3 kids and a great wife. Need to do what is the best long term solution. In British Columbia the cancer institute has some pretty good stats on the seed therapy. Any comments.",

Instead of simply standing and doing the exercises I was told to, while holding the pelvic floor muscle, to take a step forward then take a step backwards. This will alert you to your brain switching off. It's surprisingly tricky. After I got good at this, while doing the pelvic floor holding technique I would walk forward and walk backwards this made a huge difference. Another thing I was not told until 3 months had passed and which they could have told me three months earlier was that the few dribbles that can come out can simply be some trapped urine and that you can 'milk' your penis by pushing the from the front of the scrotum underneath the penis then along the urethra this can push out a small amount that would stay trapped and then dribble out.
