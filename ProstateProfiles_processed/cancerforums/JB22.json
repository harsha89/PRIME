      "Content": "I am 5 days post RPR, My doctor told me to drink 2 liters of fluid of any kind (water, soda or tea). I have alot of incontenence during the day during any kind of movement that incurs bladder stress (if Im walking or stand I have less incontenence). A pad is no good for me so I wear an adult diaper. At night I have no incontinence what-so-ever (I may get up 3 times a night with the urge to urinate, but no wet diaper. Im a little depressed about the incontenence, I hope to start seeing improvement. My wife says that since I have bo problems a night at all. that that must be a good sign. Anyone else having similar problems or advice? 50 yrs old 6(3+3) Gleason 6 of 12 cores positive Neg margins Divinci Robotic assisted",
