    "Content": "My experience happened quickly. I went for my yearly physical in August of 2014 i am 55 and was told that even though it was low 3.29 my PSA went up to much in a 1 year time frame. It was rechecked in a month and it went up again to 3.50. My Dr had me to see a urologist who checked it again this time it was 3.51. He wanted an MRI which was done Nov 2014. I was called and told they saw 3 spots they wanted to check so it was off to a biopsy on 12/1/14. On 12/15/14 i got the biopsy results it was 16 samples 1 positive a 3-3 gleason. My Dr gave 3 options beads,surgery or watch it and re biopsy on 3/23/14 and that seemed to be what he recommended. He told me that it was my decision since i had to live with it. I read and read and called his office with questions and went in and talked to him about surgery. I found i was not comfortable watching and set up the Davinci surgery. It was rough on me for about 4 days but started getting better after that and got much better after 7 days when they removed the catheter. It was the right decision for me the after biopsy gave a gleason score of 4+3 said bordering a 5+3. It has been a month now i have full erections and have only had to use a pad for some dribbling which i am still doing my kegels to hopefully correct. My next big moment comes at end of April when i get my first PSA test done, fingers crossed. My recommendation to others is to read and question and make the decision that gives you peace of mind. Good luck",
