Another psa, the same result. Biopsy showed trouble in three cores, Gleason of 3+4. My urologist told me the same options you have, and since I am 48 I went with the surgery. Surgery was on May 8 and my psa 6 weeks later showed a minuscule psa (.04). Had the usual catheter for a week, the only time I felt pain was when I stepped on the tube in the shower. No leaking problems after the first few days. The only thing not back to normal, not having full erections yet. At about 50% but seem to be \" better\" each day. I was afraid of reoccurance, that is why I chose surgery. Almost one month to the day I made the drive from northern Michigan to North Carolina then to Nashville with out any problems.

I followed all of my DR's instructions, tried to take care of myself, and biggest for me, staying patient. Now, I have as full of a recovery as possible. My DR did a great job, no problems with urinary functions (that was nearly immediate), full erections, and best of all, an undetectable PSA. At my (and your age) Da Vinci seems the way to go. Follow your DR's advice, they know what is best for you.",
