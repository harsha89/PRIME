I guess the problem is that I think I (and slowly my Dad) DO appreciate the facts of the situation, but those are pretty concrete quantitative things, full of numbers, percentages, and likelihoods. What many of you folks have (which I don't, and my Dad doesn't yet) are qualitative experiences and opinions based on those experiences. I actually do find tremendous value in your views and opinions, because they're precisely what the medical perspective lacks. I read a great book a few years back called \"Being Mortal\" by a doctor named Atul Gawande which has really shifted my perspective on treatment decisions. That's why I'm really quite interested in what your opinions and views are, because those elements are of infinitely more value to my Dad at this point then survival rates and Gleason scores.",

After meeting with another well-known and respected Doc with a reputation for leaning toward treatment alternatives, my Dad has fallen into line with the pretty much overwhelming consensus that HT is pretty much a necessity at this point, although now he's balking at the jump right to radiation...but that's a hurdle to worry about in a couple of months. Michael, you were in particular curious about my Dad's PSA, and that begs a question for somebody relatively new to the PC game. I want to say it was somewhere in the range of 10, with some elevation over the years which is primary care physician attributed to normal changes with age, but I think that that perspective and that Doc's failure to conduct any digital exams of my Dad's no-doubt slowly growing prostate over the past years havn't been the most effective way to have headed off the current issue. But at this point, does the PSA even matter? With that aggressive a disease I would assume that the value of PSA from here on out is a) ensuring that it drops to confirm the efficacy of the HT, and b) future change to get a picture of the activity of the disease after it's in remission.

      "Content": "I have a prostate cancer question that really has no answer I suppose, but I was hoping that I could ask this community for some input based on their very specific experience. My Dad is 81 years old, and in good health...some issues, but nothing major up to this point. He has just been diagnosed with P.C., and is weighing the question with no good answer regarding to treat or not to treat. His disease appears to be relatively aggressive, but he is thus far relatively symptom free. His Gleason score banged a 9-10, and there's some likely involvement in the lymph adjacent to the prostate. His docs are advising HT and radiation, which based on my very limited review of the Intertubes and this forum seems to be a pretty conventional approach. We actually have a second opinion visit with another well known doc in another city today, but I have great faith in his primary doc, and I suspect that the visit will be simple corroboration of observations and advice. Given that, I already know what the medical community would advise. I'm EXTREMELY interested to hear what the prostate cancer community would advise, particularly the older members. My Dad's initial reaction to his research of HT was that he didn't want to deal with the side effects, particularly (and ironically to me) the health risks such as cardiac risk and bone thinning. My point to him, which I don't think he's fully absorbed yet, is that I don't think the big picture is really indicating that cardiac risk is the main thing he needs to be worrying about at this juncture. So to you folks as a group: would you advise (with a great eye to the quality of life) an 81 year old in his straits to go with hormone therapy and radiation? Any advice and messages I can pass along to the patient in question would be greatly appreciated, and I certainly thank you all in advance.",
