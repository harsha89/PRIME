      "Content": "Greetings fellow travelers. So a \"routine\" PSA (9.49) in June began the process, which has involved an MRI, biopsy (Gleason 4+3), procedural delays, and my first Lupron shot in November. I am now about a third of the way through a course of 26 high-intensity IMRT treatments, having selected that as my primary therapy. (I still have a prostate, sporting three calypso beacons, although it is slowly being fried.) Here's my question: I know that my urologist is going to want to keep me on Lupron for a while. Why? I know there is \"some data\" that shows people who continue ADT after radiation live longer, but I am skeptical. What is the theory of action? No one says Lupron kills the cancer. My radiation oncologist is highly confident that his ray gun is going to destroy any cancer in the prostate bed. He also characterized the information supporting the value of continued ADT as highly uncertain. This may be a situation where I prioritize near term quality of life over some dubious promise of a longer life. Foolish move?",

While I am clearly guilty of that, I would submit that that is really all we mere humans have. I can leave the thinking to the doctors and medical researchers or I can be an active participant. So here comes more denial: Doing my own review of the literature, I find the research that I believe drives current guidelines. The logic is all based on five-year survival rates.

The way I understand it, ADT is just a timeout. It stops the clock in the progression of the disease\u0097until it doesn\u0092t.
