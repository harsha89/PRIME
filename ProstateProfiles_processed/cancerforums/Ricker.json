Had a 12 core biopsy, all negative. psa has hovered around 4 ever since until approx March of this past year when it was 6 and change with an enlarged prostate ( GP said grade 2?). Went on a 30 day course of antibiotics and it dropped to 5 something and was referred to a urologist. The urologist was great, took a detailed history, got all my old records, examined means dre was unremRkable. Waited another month and did a repeat psa which came back at 7.6 with a free psa % of 0.07. My doc had this look on his face when he told me the results. I'm nervously awaiting the biopsy in August.",

Was referred to a urologist. He examined me and still negative dre. Repeated the psa may. It was 7.2 (on Avodart) with a free psa % of 0.07. Not sure what all this means, but my urologist had \"a look\" on his face when he shared the results with me. I'm scheduled for a biopsy on August. 11. Can anyone offer any insight?",
