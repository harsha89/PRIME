      "Content": "I had a prostate biopsy done in 2/2012, and 12 cores were all negative. As my PSA continued to be high around 12, my urologist recommended me to do an MRI in 5/2013 at Memorial sloan kettering, and the report indicated a suspicious tumor in left apex. PCA3 was at 4.5 which is negative. Last month I went to see a renowned surgeon in NYC, and he wanted to do a second biopsy. I showed him the MRI report and he said he would do a 12 core biopsy with focus on the left apex area. Last week I went to his office to discuss the biopsy report. He said that the biopsy did not find any cancer, but found ASAP (Atypical small acinar proliferation) on the left side, favor benign; malignancy cannot be definitely excluded. On the right side, benigh prostatic tissue. Mild acute inflammation. He asked me to repeat the biopsy in 3 months if the PSA is still high by then. After the meeting, I asked for a copy of the report. I was surprised to see that the report (from Bostwick) indicates only 2 sites: right base (with 6 tissues) and left base (with 6 tissues), and the result says Right base benign and left base ASAP, etc. The report did not indicate from which site of the 12 sites (locations) the ASAP was found, and also did not mention how many cores have ASAP. I called the doctor's office yesterday and the nurse answered the phone since the doctor was in hospital doing surgery. I asked why 6 cores from right base, and 6 from left base, instead of one core from each site (base, mid, apex, lateral,etc), as in my first biopsy. She said the 6 cores were taken from different sites on each side of the prostate. I asked why the cores were not individually labelled, and she said it does not matter where the cancer is found the treatment is the same if it is still within the prostate. I do not know if I agree to that, as my first biopsy report indicates each specimen individually, but she said this is the way the doctor does biopsies all the time. Does anyone have a similar biopsy, 6 from each side of prostate put in a same vial without individually labelled? Or was mine really a poorly done biopsy with all 6 actually from the same site (left base and right base)? Please share your experience or opinion. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Thank you all for the useful feedbacks. If the 6 samples from each side were indeed, as the nurse said, picked from different locations, then I would feel relatively less nervous as in that case the whole prostate would be well covered, and I would assume that at least one, if not more, samples would be from the left apex where my MRI report shows a suspicious tumor. Ideally if the samples are individually labelled, it would be more helpful to know if the ASAP came from the left apex where the tumor was found on MRI. What I am more concerned is that if for whatever reason, whether an error with the biopsy machine, or from the doctor, all 6 samples were actually all from the base, exactly as the biopsy report says, then the biopsy was a waste, as the primary purpose was to clarify the suspicious tumor in the left apex, not in the base. Furthermore, it will delay the diagnosis by at least another 3 months as I have to wait for the next biopsy. I called the lab, and the client service told me that this is the first time she saw the 6 samples in one vial from my doctor, while the nurse said that the dcotor does the biopsy this way for all his patients. I do not know who to believe. The doctor is a well respected one, and did thousands of prostate surgeries before, and thousands of biopsies (per nurse) as well, and it is hard to believe that he could accidentally screw this up. However, I am not 100% convinced that the biopsy was done properly in light of the MRI findings, and I am somehow disappointed that the biopsy did not clear up the question from MRI report. Please share your thoughts on this as you might have more knowledge about this type of things. Thank you in advance.",
