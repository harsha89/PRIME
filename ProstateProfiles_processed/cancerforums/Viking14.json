    "Content": "My father\u0092s PSA was 3600 Gleason 9. He entered into a study in Houston in July of this year. After 3 treatments 8 weeks apart his PSA in now under 100 with minimal side effects. This treatment is already approved in Germany. It\u0092s a receptor that adheres to the tumor while the German based medicine ( lutetium 177) that\u0092s inside the receptor kills the cancer. German data generally says up to 80% respond favorably. This is a targeted therapy that won\u0092t kill good cells like chemo does. The study is taking in 200 patients in the US. Houston\u0092s Excel Diagnostic and nuclear oncology center and somewhere at Stanford California. There\u0092s no doubt in my mind, after data is completed this will be FDA approved. The treatment is not covered by insurance. 15k for 1st treatment and 10k for the next 3 treatments. Plus any travel you might have. Study calls for 4 treatments. You must prove a rising PSA and you must of took Zytiga or xtandi. Before. Also there are blood analysts requirements. Joe pope",
