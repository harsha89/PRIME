I am told that the dose will be 79.2 Gy for 45 sessions. I also have a condition known as Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), which further leads to bleeding issues. I try and do research in this area and come up with articles on doses of 79.2 Gy in 44 fractions VS 70.2 GY in 39 fractions. And you wonder, with bleeding and rectal issues as one of the primary side effects of radiation treatment, is one dose better in the long run, than the other? Does anyone out there have any experience in this area with similar health issues that went through or is going through EBRT? And I\u0092m not questioning my doctor\u0092s decision on this but it seems that PC has a ton of treatment plans and no shortage of opinions as to which is best for patients.
