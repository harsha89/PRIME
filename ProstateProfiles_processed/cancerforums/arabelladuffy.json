      "Content": "Hi, I started a thread earlier in regards to my fathers situation with stage 4 aggressive pc. I don't want to ramble on about it again, so I will try to make this very short. He is at stage 4, mets to his bones, his cancer type is aggressive, he has refused chemo, radiation and surgery. He is receiving hormone therapy, and some type of bone rebuilding stuff, also he is on an alternative medication called Cesium Chloride. He had a CT scan in January... which is when he was diagnosed, and another one last week to see where he is at now. Today, he spoke to his nurse, who informed him that she saw improvement. Is this even possible? I thought hormone therapy slowed things down, not improved? Either way it is good news.",

I have found a lot of websites that claim it cures half of the time, but any personal story or testimony I find, just says it either did nothing or made it worse. I can not find any personal stories where it says it worked.... I have yet to find that. I know if there were some type of \"cure all\" treatment out there, there would be tons of stories, everyone would know about it and the world would be a better place! Really! I am just hoping it's not another hoax to take poor peoples money who are desperate to live and will do and pay whatever they can to conquer the cancer.",

      "Content": "So, I just found out he has a very agressive form. I'm sure this makes a big difference in his treatment options. He must have progressed to stage 4 very quickly because he said 18 months prior to his diagnosis he did have a prostate exam that showed nothing. He is in lots of pain and says this past week it has been intolerable. I can only assume this means it's getting worse. So he is also on some type of bone growth therapy, but he says it has some very unpleasant side effects. He has yet to find out if anything he is doing is working to slow things down, I think he is scared to do an MRI. From my understanding, hormonal therapy can slow down the growth of the PROSTATE tumor, but after it has spread to a minimum of his bones, the prostate tumor is not the biggest concern anymore. He was diagnosed in January and hasn't had and check ups since. So we don't know how much worse, if at all, the cancer has become.",

      "Content": "Thank you guys so much for your replies. My dad is 66 years old. He was diagnosed at 65. Unfortunately, 2 years prior he was in and out of the hospital for back pain, the doctors then gave him an injection to help the pain and ended up giving him a life threatening infection. So they gave him a strong form of antibiotic, interveniously, which then poisoned him and caused him kidney failure and he was given a week to live. Might I add they knew nothing about his cancer at this time. They told him his back problem was from the poisoning from the antibiotics. A year of blood tests, MRIs, CT scans, X rays... Spending weeks at a time in the hospital... They were unable to find anything wrong with him. Prostate cancer runs in his family, most men get it, which surprises me that this wasn't any concern to the doctors. Finally after 2 years of endless doctor appointments, he was diagnosed at stage 4, with bone involvement. Anyway, at the time, his PSA levels were high, I think he said near a thousand or maybe more.... But after hormonal therapy, they dropped to a 1. My numbers might be wrong but I know there was a very significant drop in the PSA level, which I don't know if it matters being that he has tumors in his bones. He also said his Gleason score makes no difference because of the stage of the cancer. I am so glad I found you guys, thank you for being so friendly and welcoming. I will definately keep you guys updated. He has an upcoming MRI but I think he is scared so he is putting it off. He never did tell me if he has an aggressive type, I could only imagine he does because of all the testing he went through and nothing showed up, then all of the sudden he was at stage 4. Thank you guys again, I will keep in touch and I pray the best on all of you. Take care.",

      "Content": "So, I just found out he has a very agressive form. I'm sure this makes a big difference in his treatment options. He must have progressed to stage 4 very quickly because he said 18 months prior to his diagnosis he did have a prostate exam that showed nothing. He is in lots of pain and says this past week it has been intolerable. I can only assume this means it's getting worse. So he is also on some type of bone growth therapy, but he says it has some very unpleasant side effects. He has yet to find out if anything he is doing is working to slow things down, I think he is scared to do an MRI. From my understanding, hormonal therapy can slow down the growth of the PROSTATE tumor, but after it has spread to a minimum of his bones, the prostate tumor is not the biggest concern anymore. He was diagnosed in January and hasn't had and check ups since. So we don't know how much worse, if at all, the cancer has become.",

      "Content": "Thank you guys so much for your replies. My dad is 66 years old. He was diagnosed at 65. Unfortunately, 2 years prior he was in and out of the hospital for back pain, the doctors then gave him an injection to help the pain and ended up giving him a life threatening infection. So they gave him a strong form of antibiotic, interveniously, which then poisoned him and caused him kidney failure and he was given a week to live. Might I add they knew nothing about his cancer at this time. They told him his back problem was from the poisoning from the antibiotics. A year of blood tests, MRIs, CT scans, X rays... Spending weeks at a time in the hospital... They were unable to find anything wrong with him. Prostate cancer runs in his family, most men get it, which surprises me that this wasn't any concern to the doctors. Finally after 2 years of endless doctor appointments, he was diagnosed at stage 4, with bone involvement. Anyway, at the time, his PSA levels were high, I think he said near a thousand or maybe more.... But after hormonal therapy, they dropped to a 1. My numbers might be wrong but I know there was a very significant drop in the PSA level, which I don't know if it matters being that he has tumors in his bones. He also said his Gleason score makes no difference because of the stage of the cancer. I am so glad I found you guys, thank you for being so friendly and welcoming. I will definately keep you guys updated. He has an upcoming MRI but I think he is scared so he is putting it off. He never did tell me if he has an aggressive type, I could only imagine he does because of all the testing he went through and nothing showed up, then all of the sudden he was at stage 4. Thank you guys again, I will keep in touch and I pray the best on all of you. Take care.",
