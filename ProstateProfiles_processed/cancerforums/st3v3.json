As you know there are several treatment options if needed. Stay strong!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ontheroad How are you handling the chemo? Neuropathy in fingers, often can't hold onto things and drop them. Both heels are numb with numbness in left heel now extending into arch with pain while walking. Lower back pain increasing. After 1st treatment MO said I may have less pain going forward. Now without pain meds I can't go to sleep and with lower dose I wake up in pain. With more pain and numbness after 4th chemo I was seriously considering ending docetaxel and just continue HT and if MO suggested something else trying that. Today I'm two weeks from last treatment. The numbness and pain in arch is better so I'll go for a 5th treatment next week. I know some people consider stopping chemo a quitter attitude but if it comes down to quality of life to quantity, I'll choose quality. I want, what time I have, to enjoy tasting food and drink, and being as pain free as possible. st3v3",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ontheroad How are you handling the chemo? Neuropathy in fingers, often can't hold onto things and drop them. Both heels are numb with numbness in left heel now extending into arch with pain while walking. Lower back pain increasing. After 1st treatment MO said I may have less pain going forward. Now without pain meds I can't go to sleep and with lower dose I wake up in pain. With more pain and numbness after 4th chemo I was seriously considering ending docetaxel and just continue HT and if MO suggested something else trying that. Today I'm two weeks from last treatment. The numbness and pain in arch is better so I'll go for a 5th treatment next week. I know some people consider stopping chemo a quitter attitude but if it comes down to quality of life to quantity, I'll choose quality. I want, what time I have, to enjoy tasting food and drink, and being as pain free as possible. st3v3",

      "Content": "Introduction: First Post: Hi all, Sorry to see many people suffering and worried about what the future holds. Reading through many posts I've learned much and take courage in what I read. Maybe my journey can help those who are here or will find themselves facing a difficult time some day in the future. I'm 65 years old and will start chemo treatment in a few days. My family GP found a prostate nodule last summer. Blood test showed PSA at 5.4. Biopsy came back at Gleason 9. A bone scan in September did not show cancer. I was referred to radiation oncologist who planned treatment after MRI and CT. Markers were placed in my prostate. The MRI revealed metastatic cancer in lower spine so a second bone scan was performed and showed metastatic cancer throughout my skeleton. At this point I was referred to a medical oncologist. I suspect and hope the first bone scan was read wrong. Even if my cancer is aggressive and has spread that much in just two months maybe chemo will knock it back. Here's the plan: August 2016- Bicalutamide (20 pills) / Lupron shots every 6 months for two years started by Urologist December 6, 2016- Dexamethasone - 2 pills every 12 hours, 10 pills. December 7, 2016 - Taxotere - 6 treatments, every 3 weeks Xgeva - prevention of skeletal-related events - bone modifying agent Neulasta - stimulate growth of healthy white blood cells in bone marrow after chemo Cocktail for bone pain - 1 Clariton, 1 Benadryl, and 2 Tylenol - Take day before and few days after each chemo treatment. Last night with my wife's help I shaved my head so it won't be as much of shock when hair disappears. My wife said she's already adjusted to it, I still haven't. st3v3",

I'm 65 years old and will start chemo treatment in a few days. My family GP found a prostate nodule last summer. Blood test showed PSA at 5.4. Biopsy came back at Gleason 9.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee ST3 - I just dropped a note to you in Shreddedwolf's survival thread. Not much to say, just that your story is quite a shocker. Good luck getting thru all this. You have a lot ahead of you. Hey RobLee, The thing with my situation, I had a L1 fusion from an auto accident 16 years before cancer diagnois and 10 years before I had to take early retirement from pain that returned in my lower back. The back injury comprised bowl and bladder. And too, I had what I thought was a typical enlarged prostate that comes with age. So the restricted urination was expected. When I took early retirement I ran all over two states hoping to find a neurologist with answers. During this time my blood work and all vitals were perfect. DRE's were ok until this last summer. The neurologists could not differently tell me something. They did xrays, MRIs, and CT. Like you I thought I should speak to the doctors without my wife. One of the good things about these forums is reading what other guys experienced asking, How much time is left? It appears the specialists give the same answers to their patients. So wife present or not, that's the reply. Really I can see why. There will be an unknown percentage of patients that will survive for some time so why discourage everyone that little time is left? Another big question for me, How painful is the end? That's one it seems few want to talk about. I did find one brave guy named Doug who did a blog, I think the link was given on cancerforums.net. But for now I'm going into chemo with a positive attitude. I have a great MO, and nurse. Had my first chemo this morning and so far feel good. lol. Brave last words till a few days pass.",

Good luck getting thru all this. You have a lot ahead of you. Hey RobLee, The thing with my situation, I had a L1 fusion from an auto accident 16 years before cancer diagnois and 10 years before I had to take early retirement from pain that returned in my lower back. The back injury comprised bowl and bladder. And too, I had what I thought was a typical enlarged prostate that comes with age. So the restricted urination was expected. When I took early retirement I ran all over two states hoping to find a neurologist with answers. During this time my blood work and all vitals were perfect. DRE's were ok until this last summer. The neurologists could not differently tell me something. They did xrays, MRIs, and CT. Like you I thought I should speak to the doctors without my wife. One of the good things about these forums is reading what other guys experienced asking, How much time is left? It appears the specialists give the same answers to their patients. So wife present or not, that's the reply. Really I can see why. There will be an unknown percentage of patients that will survive for some time so why discourage everyone that little time is left? Another big question for me, How painful is the end? That's one it seems few want to talk about. I did find one brave guy named Doug who did a blog, I think the link was given on cancerforums.net. But for now I'm going into chemo with a positive attitude. I have a great MO, and nurse. Had my first chemo this morning and so far feel good. lol. Brave last words till a few days pass.",

My PSA is now down to 0.64 I have prostat3 hormone injections and chemo is docetaxel for six turns, my forth is coming up. After the chemo like everyone I get really tired very weak and always seem to develop a cough, my temp can really jump around, I was in hospital after my third chemo as it soared to 38.3 and my white blood cell count was down to 0.3 but after three days in there all better now. At the end of my chemo in February I have radiology on my prostate to shrink it just want some feed back on this and what people think. Thanks Joe Hey Joe, Looks like our treatments are the same. The radiation oncologist was about to start radiation when an MRI revealed PC in my lower spine. A followup bone scan showed metastasis throughout my skeleton. The RO still wanted to do his treatments along with the MO's, but the MO did not agree. I'm hoping chemo will give guys like us time to where new, better treatments will extend our life years more. st3v3",

The best answer seems to be those of us with prostate bone metastasis have a 47 percent chance of surviving to 5 years.

      "Content": "joeven, Good question for those of us with metastasis and low PSA as a result of treatment. If no one here knows I'll make a note to ask my MO this Thursday when I receive the 5th chemo. Yet he and his crafty nurses avoid answering questions if they think it's underlying purpose is to find out how much longer I have to live. A study done some time ago indicated men who didn't know their time limit survived longer than those who did. And I've also read that doctors really can't predict with much accuracy how much longer anyone of us advanced PC guys have, unless the end is near. With your PC metastasized I'm wondering if they are using RT for your prostate area to control pain and maybe help with urination. Did the RT help your shoulder? If my pain doesn't improve by the end of March after my 6th chemo I expect to be referred to RT. st3v3",
