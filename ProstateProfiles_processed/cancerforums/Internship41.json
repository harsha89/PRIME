      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Hi Internship41 and welcome to the Forum! I would bet that your dad is going to be around for a long time First, it seems that either his PSA is fluctuating or the testing is off for some reason: after it was 0.04 it was 0.02 again (and soon after, 0.04). Testing errors happen for whatever reason. So first, what is the doc saying? To call BCR (biochemical recurrence, or an increase of PSA). I think you would need to see a few constant increases--which isn't the case, at least yet. Also, I think his doc would need the absolute PSA level to be higher to call it BCR. Perhaps wait a few months and then retest. Secondly, those who do have BCR after a good number of years, i.e. a very slow increase, have the best prognosis compared to those who have the PSA return soon after surgery! There can then be years between this increased PSA and the first clinical signs of disease return. And he would be getting treatment during that period if he should develop BCR. It's even possible that healthy prostate cells left behind proliferate and cause a PSA rise. It's great that you are so caring, but I would relax! Let's see what the other say. Keep us posted! Djinnu Thank you so much for the reply. I am a little relieved by now. Another test is in 2-3months from now, and the doctor said maybe rt if it increases but he said that last year when it first rose to 0.04 and my dad had Ct scan for bone that found nothing.. . Wish you all well!",

      "Content": "Hello, My dad had rp at age 57 in 2013 Sept, pt3a I think and I think Gleason 7 (dont know if 3+4 or 4+3). Dont know the details, but there are no seminal vesicles and node lymph involved... Psa has been for the first one or two years below 0.02, after that 0.02, then in Autumn 2017 0.04. three months after that 0.02, then two weeks ago 0.04. all were from the same lab (beckman coulter access 2 machine i think). Now i am worried sick about my dad. How long will he live (he is 61 atm)? Will salvage RT at some point save his life? Can he live until at least 75 or does he has ončy 5 y or so? I so scared for him and dont know what to think anymore, we thought he would be cured after rp but now i fear for the worst... Some kind of encouraging news would be much appreciated. P.s. sorry for my english it is not my native tongue",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Hi Internship41 and welcome to the Forum! I would bet that your dad is going to be around for a long time First, it seems that either his PSA is fluctuating or the testing is off for some reason: after it was 0.04 it was 0.02 again (and soon after, 0.04). Testing errors happen for whatever reason. So first, what is the doc saying? To call BCR (biochemical recurrence, or an increase of PSA). I think you would need to see a few constant increases--which isn't the case, at least yet. Also, I think his doc would need the absolute PSA level to be higher to call it BCR. Perhaps wait a few months and then retest. Secondly, those who do have BCR after a good number of years, i.e. a very slow increase, have the best prognosis compared to those who have the PSA return soon after surgery! There can then be years between this increased PSA and the first clinical signs of disease return. And he would be getting treatment during that period if he should develop BCR. It's even possible that healthy prostate cells left behind proliferate and cause a PSA rise. It's great that you are so caring, but I would relax! Let's see what the other say. Keep us posted! Djinnu Thank you so much for the reply. I am a little relieved by now. Another test is in 2-3months from now, and the doctor said maybe rt if it increases but he said that last year when it first rose to 0.04 and my dad had Ct scan for bone that found nothing.. . Wish you all well!",
