      "Content": "So the news is not good. My dad definitely has advanced prostate cancer. Bone scan and CT scan being done this week to determine if it has metastasized, but the doctor thinks there is a good chance it has due to the pain my dad is experiencing in his back. Doctor started him on Degarelix- gave him one shot yesterday, and said that's for a month, then will be every six months. If there are mets, doctor said there is a new trial that is promising: LATITUDE Trial (addition of Abiraterone to standard hormone therapy.) He also said maybe radiation. We have a follow up on Monday so hopefully I will know more then. I am so upset about this. can't seem to think straight. I would appreciate any suggestions of additional questions to ask at the next appointment. Here is the pathology report from the biopsy (looks pretty bad to me, based on what I've read): Specimen - # of places - L (mm) - Diagnosis - Gleason Score - Grade Group - % tumor - Tumor L (mm) A.
