      "Content": "I wanted some second and third opinions. Thanks in advance. I had just about the lowest form of prostate cancer that anyone would even do anything about. I opted for LDR/HDR which ended in May 2015. The treatments went well with some negative affects from the radiation, but not nearly as bad as my imagination thought it could be. But since then there hasn\u0092t been one day where I did not have a burning sensation when I pee. I have been on Tamsulosin since the treatments began. I tried to stop taking them for a few days and my stream went from medium to weak\u0085so I\u0092m back. I tried UTA and except for the pretty color, they did not have much effect. After a 4 month fight with my insurance company, I was actually able to get a daily 5mg does of Cialis. That helped some, but not completely. Helped a little in the bedroom as well, but far from completely. I\u0092ve been on Cialis for 6 months. My radiologist has put me on a 3 month regiment of Pentoxifylline, Indomethacin, and vitamin E. I\u0092m about half way through and it has helped, but again, not all the way. As expected, the initial PSA results dropped tremendously, to the 1.2 area. It went down to 1.08 but my last one had a slight uptick\u0085which my urologist says is not unexpected. I am currently waiting on the latest results. Neither my Urologist or Radiologist are too concerned with my current condition, but I am. My Urologist is suggesting that if the drugs do not help, he can perform a Cystoscopy with a possible dilation. Am I ever going to urinate normally? Will my sex life (currently rated in the 1-2 out of 10 range) get better? I also have an odd sensation in my groin. To be tacky, it is best described as \u0093blue balls\u0094. Ejaculation does not help. This started about 3 weeks ago. Any help would be appreciated. FX",

I had the biopsies because my Dad had prostate cancer, and my brother has Gleason 6, 3 of 12 (they're just watching him). BTW, since I posted I received my latest PSA. Below 1.0 for the first time. I know that I should be happy, but 16+ months of this has got me a little down. Not an uncommon reaction I'm sure. I do have a theory...let me know what think. I believe that my prostate is finally dying and that's why I have discomfort down there. All my doctors have mentioned numerous times that just because the pain and discomfort is felt in one area, does not mean that is where the issue is...because of all the nerves that are down there.",

      "Content": "Hi Folks, About 12 years ago, I was diagnosed with a rare genetic heart condition. I found a forum on the web, and I credit that organization with saving my life. So I\u0092m very pro medical forums. So let\u0092s get the numbers out of the way; Gleason score of 6 PSA-4.0 Cancer found in 9 of 12 places with the biopsy. My wife and I have been around the web a few laps in researching my treatment options. What I wanted to know is if there is a website or document that lists all the treatment options, their survival rates, and the percentages of side effects (ED, Incontinence, pain, etc)? I would also like to know if the following is a fair statement: Most people opt for surgery (Prostatectomy) because either they have an advanced form of cancer or they want the quickest understanding that their cancer is gone. Appreciate your replies in advance. Felix",

I was thinking of maybe taking one Flomax in the morning and one at night when my urologist said I should try Rapaflo. I started taking it every night and it almost immediately helped.

Although I have other life problems over the last 6 months, I did not believe that any of them could cause the level of anxiety that I was feeling.
