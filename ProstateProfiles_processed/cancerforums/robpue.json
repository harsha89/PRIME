    "Content": "I have been considering HIFU procedure to treat my prostate cancer, my gleason score is 6, PSA is 7.8 and they found 5 maligns cores out of 9. Searching information about this procedure I found that in USA has been approved last October 2015 however has been used to treat prostate cancer for several years in Europe and in our country cancer patients had to travel to Bermudas or Mexico to have this procedure. My Understanding is that it is a very promising procedure with very good results, however I would like to have some feedback from people that had HIFU in the past and see how are they doing after some time and what was their experience. I would appreciate your advice. robpue",
