      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sw1218 hello, i have my results of the biopsy. my report says 6 of the 8 cores taken are gleason 7 prostate cancer. here's the rest of what was said and written. i down't know how to attach the pathology report for everyone to C. that's quite a bit to copy. i'm scared and sad. i don't know what to do. This letter is a follow-up to our telephone call today 2/28/2019. As I discussed with you, your pathology results for your prostate biopsy indicates that SIX of your EIGHT sample cores were positive for prostatic adenocarcinoma (prostate cancer). The severity of prostate cancer is graded on a scale from 2 to 10 called the Gleason Score. Prostate cancer with Gleason Scores 7 through 10 are considered ones in which medical intervention is required. SIX of your prostate samples from the three lesions previously identified by MRI prostate had Gleason Scores of 7 or greater. Medical intervention is typically radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of the entire prostate). However, these are not the only treatment options available to patients. Your earlier MRI of prostate indicated that there was no evidence of spread of cancer beyond the prostate to the lymph nodes or pelvic bones. This is great news! You have informed me that you will contact me early the week of March 4th 2019 to inform me who you would like to meet with for the Multidisciplinary Prostate Cancer Clinic appointment. I can schedule you with Dr. Sanda, Dr. Patteras or Dr. Filson. The purpose of the Multidisciplinary Prostate Cancer Clinic: \u0095 To inform patient of all available treatment choices \u0095 To help patient evaluate all the treatment options \u0095 To answer questions about available therapies \u0095 To help patient with choosing a treatment option What we recommend between now and your appointment is to do your own research on the following topics. Prostate cancer, radiation therapy for prostate cancer, prostatectomy, recovery time after prostatectomy, and Gleason Scores. This research will help you formulate questions to ask the doctor that you meet with at the follow-up. We encourage you to bring either a spouse, fiancee, family member or friend to your follow-up appointment. This will allow you to focus your attention on the discussion with the doctor while your guest can capture notes and provide emotional support. A copy of your pathology report for prostate biopsy is attached. Listed is a link that may be helpful in your research about prostate cancer: https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/C...ic/8796.00.pdf Please let me know if you have any questions in regard to your results. Sincerely, Jan Johnson, NP-C Hi Sw1218, many of us had gone through what you experienced. I can understand the emotional and mental duress. I'm sure many of the brothers here can attest to that. I too was a G7 (4+3) after TRUS biopsy, which turned out 3+4 in post RP. have completed 1 round of RT as well. Do stay strong and work with your doctors to decide the best possible treatment. Your partner is really important in providing you the solid home support you need, so hold fast to each other. All the best!",
