      "Content": "Preston, Thankyou for posting the name of the drug. If I were you I'd keep taking the flavoxate for a while when the catheter is removed again. When I was having the spasms at home I called my MD (during the night). He did not want me to go to the ED either becuase he did not feel they would give me the correct care as they would not understand the details of what was done to me surgically. He convinced me to wait until morning and he would open early and meet me there which is what I did. It does not suprise me that you are not having any more spasms since putting the catheter back in. It may not be the drugs though. My doc after seeing me have this right in his exam room put the catheter back in me as well (just 24hrs after removing it). He said that alone would stop the spasms. He was right. Nothing again since. He just called me to check in and said again he has seen this on rare occassions and putting the catheter back in and letting things heal up a bit longer usually does the trick. He has me going in Monday to have it removed again. I told him there was absolutely no way I wanted to chance that kind of pain again. He said he understood although he really didn't think it would happen again on Monday. I said I wanted something to take just in case. He said that he would give me something to take for the first week the catheter was out but he said again that he didn't think it would be necessary. For me it is worth the insurance.",

      "Content": "Hi folks. I'm new to the forum. Was hoping to run something by the group to see if anyone has heard of this. First my background -------------------------- o 48 yr old male o ~ 3 yrs ago PCP concerned about PSA velocity (even though PSA level only 1.5) and referred me to Urologist o To this day DRE negative, PSA 2.6, velocity running ~ .5/yr o April/2006 biopsy negative o Continued close monitoring of PSA and DRE o 12/15/2007 biopsy showed 2 of 12 cores with disease o 1 core = 10% Gleason 3+3, 1 core = 5% Gleason 3 + 4 o 1/3/08 CT & Bone Scans negative o 1/23/08 Radical Prostatectomy & lymphectomy via DaVinci Robot o Surgeon had done over 550 cases o Surgeon said all looked healthy - nerves were preserved o Post surgical pathology = Gleason 3+3, clean margins, lymph noes clear, seminal vesicle clear, disease found in both sides of prostate. The Problem (& reason for posting): ------------------- Yesterday at 10am I had my catheter out (7 days post surgery). Prior to catheter removal NP filled bladder with solution. She then removed catheter and not a drop was lost. I even had to ask her to leave the room so I could relax and urinate which I did without any problem. Rest of the day was great. Drank 8 oz water per hour (per NP) until 4p and reported back that I was voiding OK and all was good, small amount of blood in urine each time. I was still dry except for one small unexpected dribble later in the evening. The only issue so far was I really couldn't feel when I had to void. So I just went in and voided on a regular basis. At 12 midnight I got up to void. Just as I attempted to relax and void I got hit with really bad bladder spasms.The pain is the worst I have ever felt in my life and I am no wimp. I teetered on the edge of blacking out and throwing up from the pain for 30 to 60 min. Pain was so bad my whole body was shaking and I was sweating profusely. Two Percocets and 3 Ibuprofen didn't help (first pain meds since surgery). Nothing would stop it other than letting the spams run their course of about 1 hour. I had no idea a human could endure this kind of pain for this long. No exageration. So this happened twice during the night. The level of pain scared the hell out of me so I called the docs office. I was on the phone off and on with MD on call (I don't think he did the surgeries himself) and we finally agreed the ED wasn't the place to go so we decided I would come in to the office early. Long story short after some testing and an attempt to void it happened right in the exam room. I looked so bad the med tech in the room got so freaked out at how I looked he said he was taking me across the parking lot to the ED. I said no way go get the doc (busy practice). Shortly thereafter my surgeon appeared and said he has seen this a few times. He thought it was likely that the bladder neck or something nearby was not healed enough yet. He seemed confident and proceeded to put the catheter back in until Monday. Honestly, I'd have done anything to get rid of the pain. The Question: ------------------------ Sorry for the long-winded post but has anyone hear heard of this or experienced it? I am really freaked out that this will re-occur when the catheter is removed on Monday. I cannot bear to even think about experiencing that kind of pain again. Thanks for any insight you can provide. -Matt",

      "Content": "Preston, Thankyou for posting the name of the drug. If I were you I'd keep taking the flavoxate for a while when the catheter is removed again. When I was having the spasms at home I called my MD (during the night). He did not want me to go to the ED either becuase he did not feel they would give me the correct care as they would not understand the details of what was done to me surgically. He convinced me to wait until morning and he would open early and meet me there which is what I did. It does not suprise me that you are not having any more spasms since putting the catheter back in. It may not be the drugs though. My doc after seeing me have this right in his exam room put the catheter back in me as well (just 24hrs after removing it). He said that alone would stop the spasms. He was right. Nothing again since. He just called me to check in and said again he has seen this on rare occassions and putting the catheter back in and letting things heal up a bit longer usually does the trick. He has me going in Monday to have it removed again. I told him there was absolutely no way I wanted to chance that kind of pain again. He said he understood although he really didn't think it would happen again on Monday. I said I wanted something to take just in case. He said that he would give me something to take for the first week the catheter was out but he said again that he didn't think it would be necessary. For me it is worth the insurance.",

      "Content": "Hi folks. I'm new to the forum. Was hoping to run something by the group to see if anyone has heard of this. First my background -------------------------- o 48 yr old male o ~ 3 yrs ago PCP concerned about PSA velocity (even though PSA level only 1.5) and referred me to Urologist o To this day DRE negative, PSA 2.6, velocity running ~ .5/yr o April/2006 biopsy negative o Continued close monitoring of PSA and DRE o 12/15/2007 biopsy showed 2 of 12 cores with disease o 1 core = 10% Gleason 3+3, 1 core = 5% Gleason 3 + 4 o 1/3/08 CT & Bone Scans negative o 1/23/08 Radical Prostatectomy & lymphectomy via DaVinci Robot o Surgeon had done over 550 cases o Surgeon said all looked healthy - nerves were preserved o Post surgical pathology = Gleason 3+3, clean margins, lymph noes clear, seminal vesicle clear, disease found in both sides of prostate. The Problem (& reason for posting): ------------------- Yesterday at 10am I had my catheter out (7 days post surgery). Prior to catheter removal NP filled bladder with solution. She then removed catheter and not a drop was lost. I even had to ask her to leave the room so I could relax and urinate which I did without any problem. Rest of the day was great. Drank 8 oz water per hour (per NP) until 4p and reported back that I was voiding OK and all was good, small amount of blood in urine each time. I was still dry except for one small unexpected dribble later in the evening. The only issue so far was I really couldn't feel when I had to void. So I just went in and voided on a regular basis. At 12 midnight I got up to void. Just as I attempted to relax and void I got hit with really bad bladder spasms.The pain is the worst I have ever felt in my life and I am no wimp. I teetered on the edge of blacking out and throwing up from the pain for 30 to 60 min. Pain was so bad my whole body was shaking and I was sweating profusely. Two Percocets and 3 Ibuprofen didn't help (first pain meds since surgery). Nothing would stop it other than letting the spams run their course of about 1 hour. I had no idea a human could endure this kind of pain for this long. No exageration. So this happened twice during the night. The level of pain scared the hell out of me so I called the docs office. I was on the phone off and on with MD on call (I don't think he did the surgeries himself) and we finally agreed the ED wasn't the place to go so we decided I would come in to the office early. Long story short after some testing and an attempt to void it happened right in the exam room. I looked so bad the med tech in the room got so freaked out at how I looked he said he was taking me across the parking lot to the ED. I said no way go get the doc (busy practice). Shortly thereafter my surgeon appeared and said he has seen this a few times. He thought it was likely that the bladder neck or something nearby was not healed enough yet. He seemed confident and proceeded to put the catheter back in until Monday. Honestly, I'd have done anything to get rid of the pain. The Question: ------------------------ Sorry for the long-winded post but has anyone hear heard of this or experienced it? I am really freaked out that this will re-occur when the catheter is removed on Monday. I cannot bear to even think about experiencing that kind of pain again. Thanks for any insight you can provide. -Matt",
