      "Content": "My history is listed below. I know I was fortunate to have Gleason 6. My heart goes out to those who continue to \"fight the bear.\" I continue running 40 miles a week. I am fully continent and often sleep through the night , without a trip to the bathroom. In a public restroom I am in and out as fast as when I was 20. ED has been an ongoing issue - However- In the past year or so I started noticing a semi- erection occuring between 12-3 AM. This continues to improve. In the past several months , I often have very good \"wood\" during this time period, without any meds. The erection lasts about 10 minutes, and my wife and I take full advantage....... Anyway, I had considered injections, but I am holding off on that now. My major point is that nerves can take a LONG TIME to recover- slower than cold molasses, but they CAN heal over time.",

Makes an excellent seal, even with a cheap pump. The retainer ring with ears has worked fine for me. No breakage.",
