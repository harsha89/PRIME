      "Content": "Hi, My uncle who is 68 years had difficulty urinating for the last few months. Other than this single issue, he is perfectly healthy, no pains, fevers, etc. There is no history of any type of cancer to anyone in his family (at least we haven't heard for the last few generations). Last week, when the urologist had asked the following tests, it came like this. The initial ultrasound scan revealed the size of prostate swollen as 75cc. When PSA was taken it was showing as > 100 ng/ml. There was little urinary infection as well. When the doctor gave the medication, on the 2nd scan, the swelling of the prostate came down showing 70cc from 75cc. However, the PSA is still showing as > 100 ng/ml. Now the doctor had asked for biopsy, which was taken and we are waiting for the result anxiously. The questions I have - 1. Since he is not complaining of any pains anywhere in the body, and perfectly active other than this urine blockage, other than prostate cancer, can BHP or urinary infection can cause such high elevated PSA levels taken in a gap of 1 week? 2. The medication (for infection) he is taking actually reducing the size of the enlarged prostate. Can this confirm whether only BHP will be reduce the swelling through medication, or can the malignant tumors also react and reduce in size to these medications? 3. The DRE (digital rectal examination) did not reveal any unusual bumps other than the prostate enlargement. Can this confirm whether it is BHP or malignant despite having elevated psa level? Can someone, please respond to my above queries? Thanks.",

      "Content": "Thanks mtsarpilot and Fairwind. Both of you have mentioned it is slow-growing which give some hope. The family is under the impression thinking he might have had this problem for quite a few years, and know things are manifested with more urine blockage until recently. Assuming if the original enlargement might have started several years back, unnoticed. Possible? One more day to go for the biopsy results. I will keep posted with the results and what the doctors say. I was under the impression that only benign tumor enlargement can be reduced with normal antibiotics. Can the antibiotics reduce the size of prostate which has malignant tumor?",

      "Content": "Thanks to all for your response. As we are waiting for the biopsy results, once we get in the morning, I will update the same in this forum and see what the doctor says. My uncle still says he is perfectly fine. The first symptom we notice is this urine blockage. We are baffled and really don't know if it is really going to manifest. Gentlemen, I'm under the impression the treatment will make a person bedridden. Is this true? Most of you are saying you are leading normal lives like others. Now we understand the complications of erectile dysfunction after surgery, and at this age of 68 he doesn't have any hesitation to remove it completely.",
