      "Content": "Hi everybody, I finally had the catheter removed after 14 days and what a RELIEF! I am wondering what I should expect, I remember reading about weighing the pull ups to see how much I am leaking, but what about the urge to urinate. Does that come back immediately? I am going for my 1st PSA test on aug 19, I asked the doc if 5 weeks was enough time for my first after surgery test and he said it is. We had a good talk and my Gleason score was downgraded to 6 after pathology( it was a 7(3+4) after the biopsy) so I felt good about that. I have started doing the Kegel exercises and am feeling good, but the doc wants me to take it easy for awhile. I have gained so much insight from the people on this forum and it is lightening the load on my journey. I thank you all for your patience with me and if I am able to answer any questions I will gladly do so.",

      "Content": "Sounds good, I had my open prostatectomy on 7/13/15, right after you and everything seems to be going good. I started using pads and am doing my kegels and the incontinence is getting better almost daily. The 19th I go to see the urologist and have my first PSA since surgery, I thought it was a little soon and asked him about it. He told me that enough time had passed. Here is hoping I join the zero club. Nice present Masbirdies, we just bought three acres to build our retirement home on in a couple of years. Wishing you well..",
