      "Content": "Since it\u2019s Thanksgiving weekend and I have a lot to be thankful for, I\u2019ll share my story. I\u2019m 56 now, and in reasonably good health. Both my grandfather and father had Prostate Cancer, so I sort of knew it was going to be hard for me to avoid the genetic lottery. However both were diagnosed later in life (Grandfather at 88 (lived to 94!)) and my father at 75. My dad went with the pellet implants, and he passed at 86. Last December (2013), at my annual physical, my PSA was 4.5, nothing felt with DRE, so my physician gave me an antibiotic to eliminate any chance of a prostate infection. PSA didn\u2019t change, so he recommended visiting urologist. Nothing felt by urologist with a DRE, and his PSA test said 4.8. Urologist recommended a biopsy, but I decided to wait a while. At follow up with physician in July, PSA was 4.9. Decided to proceed with biopsy, had it done in late July. Result was 1 core positive for PC, right apex, 15% involved, Gleason 4 + 4. Although as I said earlier, I wasn\u2019t really surprised, it was still a lot to process for me. After discussion with urologist, we both agreed at my age, family history, etc., the best course of action was to have my Prostate removed. My local urologist told me he only did the open prostatectomy. I went and got a 2nd opinion at a much larger Urology clinic about an hour away (state capitol city). Met with a couple doctors that were amazing. Discussed Da Vinci procedure, which they performed. My complication was that I had an umbilical hernia repaired several years ago, with a mesh implant used. Doctors were not concerned about this and also recommended re-reading the biopsy slides at another lab. Re-read of slides came back as Gleason 3 + 4, which was encouraging for me. Made the decision to have Da Vinci surgery, but wanted to wait until November, as I had signed up to walk a half marathon with my family in early November. Doctor prescribed Proscar, and said have fun, see you in November. Fast forward to a few weeks ago. Did the half marathon on Sunday, November 9th, and had my surgery on Tuesday, November 11. Spent 2 days in the hospital, with a little pain, but not anywhere what I had expected. Doctor wanted my new constant companion (catheter) to remain in for 2 weeks, mainly due to some mild issues with scar tissue from hernia surgery which made re-attaching my urethra a little more difficult. Made it thru those 2 weeks uneventfully, but as most of you know, it\u2019s a grind. Finally, this past Wednesday was my day to lose my dance partner, and boy was it a relief to say good-bye! Also got the good news that the final pathology report was Gleason 3 + 3! I\u2019m now doing my Kegels and trying to get control back. I\u2019ve noticed I leak more when I\u2019m tired, and also when getting up from sitting. So far, I\u2019m mostly dry when sleeping in my bed (which is a relief, had to sleep in recliner with my catheter because I just could not get comfortable in bed). I know I\u2019m relatively early in this part of the process and have to be patient, but I\u2019m glad I\u2019m now on the back side of the process. I\u2019m so glad to have found this forum and got a lot of comfort from reading about the experiences and advice of others that have gone through this process. I\u2019m not really a huge forum poster, but will update somewhere down the road. Cheers, Wheelar",

Is unitary continence a \"straight line\" of improvement or are there good and bad days/nights? 4 days post catheter I've experienced both. Been doing a lot of reading but don't see much on the day to day trials and tribulations. Hope everyone has a great day. Thanks in advance for your input!",

I get some mild burning when I urinate, but from what I\u0092ve read it\u0092s nothing to be concerned about and will go away. My guess is all the plumbing is healing but is still raw in spots. Also passing very, very small clots from time to time. Kegels are easy to so when you\u0092re watching TV. My Dr. told me to do 4 reps of 8 per day, and after reading the Mayo instructions, I\u0092ve ended up compromising and doing them twice a day, morning and afternoon. I can almost feel the muscles getting tired when I do them. But I do think they are getting stronger! Sitting down and getting up is pretty much a dry event now. If I\u0092m staying around the house, I can use the same pad all day. Sleeping is also better, but I\u0092m still getting up every 3 hours to pee. It\u0092s like having BPH all over again\u0085..I wear a diaper for now just in case but am considering transition to pads for overnight use soon.

I\u0092m amazed just how much endurance I\u0092ve lost, but am working on rebuilding it. It is coming back. Heading out of town in mid January so have to be ready.

It was a little scary venturing back out into public the first time\u0097had visions of leaking all over in Sam\u0092s Club.
