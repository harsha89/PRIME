      "Content": "Thanks for the information, TMCM. Do try to wrangle treatment at best (most expert) cancer center within your travel radius. There is some decent medicine here in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, but MD Anderson in Houston was within a day's drive. We jumped on it with both feet. I was surprised when the Uro here called for a biopsy with PSA only 4, but the guy was right on. (Dude did use *really* firm pressure on the DRE, though; won't miss that at all.) Very best wishes, and keep us informed as things develop. - Shu",

      "Content": "Frankly, I'd be astonished if anyone truly ever - in spite of what they or anyone else might say - returned to pre-operative erectile function. No matter how 'nerve sparing' the surgery, I just don't think those delicate tissues like getting jerked around and ripped out of their happy home. Pretty good recovery to an acceptable level within a few months, I could go along with. But back to pre-op level, I just don't see it. Anyhow, I think I had an excellent doc. With Gleason 3+4 going in there was no expected need to cut or remove any nerves. Six months post-op, spontaneous erections are near totally absent. It takes a while to get worked up, but when needed we can 'rise to the occasion' with just visual and tactile stimulation - no resort to pharmacutacles or mechanical means. That's my story, and I'm stickin' to it. Not bad for a 70 yr old dude.",

      "Content": "Incidentally, and FWIW: erections, while always available and adequate when the need arose (so to speak) without resort to pharmaceutical or mechanical-device assistance, have also been well short of 'prize-winning' territory. This past week however, 14 months post-op, I was pleasingly surprised to awake several times to Morning Wood to rank well up on the Rockwell Hardness scale. In other news, the variety of pains in right groin, testicle, and inner thigh mostly subsided at 12 months post-op after I totally backed off trying to match the pre-op 10,000 daily meters on the Concept II rowing machine. (The groin area, site of two previous hernia repair scar tissue, was doubtless pried open again for the prostatectomy.) The ol' scrotum had been hanging dangerously low, so the last month I made it a point to sleep supine with rolled up towel between the legs keeping said appendage elevated above the crush zone. Perhaps healing just takes longer than we expect, but gets there eventually. Still far-and-away better than living with a constant subliminal nag 'when-am-i-gonna-do-something-about-this-cancer?'. - Shu",

      "Content": "Incidentally, and FWIW: erections, while always available and adequate when the need arose (so to speak) without resort to pharmaceutical or mechanical-device assistance, have also been well short of 'prize-winning' territory. This past week however, 14 months post-op, I was pleasingly surprised to awake several times to Morning Wood to rank well up on the Rockwell Hardness scale. In other news, the variety of pains in right groin, testicle, and inner thigh mostly subsided at 12 months post-op after I totally backed off trying to match the pre-op 10,000 daily meters on the Concept II rowing machine. (The groin area, site of two previous hernia repair scar tissue, was doubtless pried open again for the prostatectomy.) The ol' scrotum had been hanging dangerously low, so the last month I made it a point to sleep supine with rolled up towel between the legs keeping said appendage elevated above the crush zone. Perhaps healing just takes longer than we expect, but gets there eventually. Still far-and-away better than living with a constant subliminal nag 'when-am-i-gonna-do-something-about-this-cancer?'. - Shu",

No matter how 'nerve sparing' the surgery, I just don't think those delicate tissues like getting jerked around and ripped out of their happy home. Pretty good recovery to an acceptable level within a few months, I could go along with. But back to pre-op level, I just don't see it. Anyhow, I think I had an excellent doc. With Gleason 3+4 going in there was no expected need to cut or remove any nerves. Six months post-op, spontaneous erections are near totally absent. It takes a while to get worked up, but when needed we can 'rise to the occasion' with just visual and tactile stimulation - no resort to pharmacutacles or mechanical means. That's my story, and I'm stickin' to it. Not bad for a 70 yr old dude.",

No matter how 'nerve sparing' the surgery, I just don't think those delicate tissues like getting jerked around and ripped out of their happy home. Pretty good recovery to an acceptable level within a few months, I could go along with. But back to pre-op level, I just don't see it. Anyhow, I think I had an excellent doc. With Gleason 3+4 going in there was no expected need to cut or remove any nerves. Six months post-op, spontaneous erections are near totally absent. It takes a while to get worked up, but when needed we can 'rise to the occasion' with just visual and tactile stimulation - no resort to pharmacutacles or mechanical means. That's my story, and I'm stickin' to it. Not bad for a 70 yr old dude.",

Then removing the prostate removes all the cancer - excepting that cancer cells may have crept outside along nerve pathways in an amount too small to be detected at the time (\"perineural invasion\"). If some cancer has escaped but none has left the locality of the prostate, then a radiation treatment is perhaps more appropriate - maybe combined with some hormones to suppress growth.

      "Content": "TMCM - Ouch! Plenty of 4+4 and 4+3 there in your assay. I'm thinking the next important question is: is/not the cancer still contained within the prostate. The CAT and bone scans should provide fairly reliable answer. Surgery is most appropriate if the cancer is still contained. Then removing the prostate removes all the cancer - excepting that cancer cells may have crept outside along nerve pathways in an amount too small to be detected at the time (\"perineural invasion\"). If some cancer has escaped but none has left the locality of the prostate, then a radiation treatment is perhaps more appropriate - maybe combined with some hormones to suppress growth. We are not medical professionals here, as you doubtless know, just folks with a very personal interest in prostate cancer. You should investigate all options, including treatment at a nationally ranked cancer center in Philly or beyond. Good news is prostate cancers grow slowly, but G=4+4 is serious business. If you care to share: your age, what prompted the biopsy, and had you been getting periodic PSA and DRE tests? Very best wishes to you - shu",

      "Content": "Welcome, Felix - I'm thinking that most folks who go for the surgery do so because: ..If PSA drops to and remains at undetectable (after pre-operation existing hormone diminishes) there is very good assurance that no prostate cells exist anywhere in the body and all cancer removed; ..the whole prostate is available for pathology review. If it is known that the cancer has escaped and is well spread to distant sites, then removing the prostate may have no great affect on survival time, but just slaps the body with more insult to handle during treatment with hormones, radiation, etc. Your numbers of Gleason 6, PSA 4.0, 9 of 12 cores positive, suggest good prospect for containment in the prostate, and time available for study and decision; no need to panic. A DRE, digital rectal examination to check for palpable bumps on the prostate would provide helpful information. Sorry, have no links to statistical sites to offer. Numbers are interesting but often hide as much as they reveal. Every case is different, so should your decision be - to fit your physical and mental state, not shucked off on running some numbers. Very best wishes - Shu",

With a maternal grandfather, father, paternal uncle, and older brother diagnosed with PC, I'd started an annual DRE and PSA at age 45. I tell that to my kids, and ain't too shy to mention it to any other male of that age. 'Nuf to make a strong man weep, seeing folks first post on the board here: \"I / my husband / my Dad didn't know what a PSA was, but we just had a biopsy and it's G:4+4=8.\" <\/rant> - shu",

      "Content": "Sandra - Welcome to the forum. Exactly as others have said. It is too soon to panic. The time now is for learning about prostate cancer generally, and testing to determine the nature of your Dad's particular cancer. If the cancer is still within the prostate gland, the situation is entirely fixable by either surgery to remove the gland, or a variety of radiation treatments to kill it in place. Even if there is some slight escape through the margin of the prostate, salvage radiation after surgery may be effective in fixing that. If the cancer has widely spread from the prostate, it is unfortunately a matter of pushing back the tumor growth rate and management of symptoms. IF it comes to that, there are several contributing here who are on that path - or are wives, daughters, or sons of a guy in treatment. Wilde makes an excellent point. Once cancer is confirmed by a biopsy, it is ill advised to spend time in pursuit of ineffective \"treatments. Diet, exercise, and good attitude all contribute to avoiding cancer and to getting through a treatment regimen. But NONE of them, alone or in combination, will \"cure\" cancer. Stay calm, get informed, learn the results of the biopsy and scans, help your Dad make an informed choice regarding available treatments. Our very best wishes to you and your Dad - shu",

      "Content": "Don't know. I had rt inguinal hernia repair at age 5, Lt. side at age 17, and both sides re-done about 2001. Then the area got worked over again last year with the prostatectomy. Some sharp single pains, like a pinch or needle poke, was something I had after the laproscopic work in 2001, but not after the prostatectomy. I put it down to surgical staples inside. Several times - every three or four months for a couple of years after the 2001 surgery, I would lift something wrong, or twist while lifting, and swear I'd sprung another hernia. But no, two or three weeks avoiding heavy work, and whatever was torn loose seemed to heal back. Actually it was about 1 year before I could sit for a long period without discomfort, and two years before I felt no more random pains or other problems. Same thing after the prostatectomy. Eight months out I thought I was cast iron again, and pushed up to 10 kilometers daily on the Concept 2 rowing machine. Then groin pains, rt testicle swelling, etc. Totally left off the rowing machine for two months, got an ultrasound of the area, and it's almost back to normal. Started ten days ago back on the rower with 2K, up to 6K now. Just don't push it, Steve. Gotta give it some time.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Cancerinoregon Now he's taking the SP only. I am worried though. Can the SP actually kill cancer cells in time, not just reduce the hormone? They never gave him the option of hormone therapy because his hormones were fine I guess. I had read that the following are useful in killing cancer cells. Is this true? Welcome to the Board, Oregon - Keeping in mind that most of us, me specifically, are not medical professionals, I will say: ..Can Saw Palmetto kill cancer cells? No. ..Hormone therapy, as I understand it, is not used when hormones are out of balance but rather to purposely *un*balance hormone levels - to load up on female hormones, suppress prostatic activity, thus retard (but not kill) cancer growth rate. (That along with enlarged breasts, hot flashes, and the rest of it.) ..Are any of the following useful in killing cancer cells? No. That said, I see in the statistics a 70 yr old guy in generally good physical condition (better weight and body mass than myself), an elevated PSA, biopsy with four cores of G:3+3=6. (Not to say there is not something more dangerous that escaped sampling.) So, there is cancer there; but G:3+3=6 is not very aggressive. May well be your Dad will live many years and pass on due to some other cause without the known cancer ever becoming a real problem. Active Surveillance, as I understand the criteria, is not appropriate management because there are four cores and involvement on both sides. What your Dad is doing now, the Saw Palmetto \"Cure\", is better described as *in*active surveillance. At age 70, it's maybe a hard choice - to actively treat it or just let it go. For myself, at age 69.5 in good health with some G:3+4=7, we instantly went for surgical treatment. Takes all the worry out of it. Do encourage your Dad to get informed, get a more realistic grip on things, and make a better informed decision. And I'm thinking if he is going to get it treated, the sooner the better - not because of the G:3+3=6 (a concern but no cause for panic) but rather because at age 70 ability to tolerate treatment may start to decline steeply. My very best wishes to you and your Dad. - Shu",

      "Content": "That was my concern also. I'd had a double laproscopic hernia repair about 10 years prior. Also, one hernia repaired each side in my youth. MD Anderson hospital in Houston went ahead with the daVinci procedure. Surgeon said it took a little longer than the usual operation. IIRC he also said he found a couple of other weak areas and slapped some patches on. The prostatectomy was just over a year ago. The right groin area, right testicle, right inner thigh, etc. have been somewhat problematic - but that is the side that was most difficult with the hernias a decade ago. Same thing with this recovery - circulation pains develop if I sit too long (driving or at computer), and I tend to press the limits with working outside and on the exercise machine. Hope this helps.

There is also a lot of gas (used to inflate a work space for the robot between skin and innards) which will migrate out through the gut. Remember the hydrocodone tends toward constipation, and you don't want that. Shoulder pain comes from being positioned head down and butt up on the operating table. Didn't find that myself, but a lot of the guys mentioned it. Best advice I saw on pads, which we followed, was get a small pack of kiddie diapers, about 3 yr old. Cut them in two, halfway between bow and stern. Cheaper than adult pads. First few days off the catheter you'll still be wearing loose pants and not going out in public much. By the time you work through those, you will have a better idea of what capacity and how many adult products to buy. I still have half a 50 ct box of drip pads on the closet shelf. - shu",

      "Content": "Cathy - You mention options, which I take to mean surgery vs. one of the several radiation treatments. Surgery is all I can speak to from personal experience, although father and elder brother did select a radiation treatment. My understanding is that \"cure\" rates (no detectable cancer at 5 years post treatment) are statistically the same for surgery and several of the radiation methods. Colateral effects, urinary incontinence and erectile function, are immediate after surgery - with recovery of both common as time passes. With radiation there are no immediate colateral effects - but they often do appear with the passage of time. You whack the prostate out and re-align the plumbing, yeah there's gonna be some urinary and erection problems right off. But barring unusual problems with the surgery, prospects are good once the shock of trauma wears off. It is major surgery. Expect to be out a few weeks from a desk job, maybe a couple of months if work is physical. With the prostate gone, PSA effectively zero at six weeks means you got it all out. You dose the area with radiation, yeah there's gonna be some tissue scarring. The scars may harden and grow over time, may cause some urinary and erectile problems. May be some scheduling problems with work during radiation treatments, but no major interferrence or time away. PSA dropping after radiation treatment means there is less cancer than before; time will tell. At least that's my take on it. For myself, we chose surgery ..for the certainty, after pathology of the prostate and the six week PSA test, of cure being effective; and ..because being retired, time away from work was not an issue. You can see from the signature block below that at six weeks post surgery we had no detectatble PSA, acceptable urinary control, and acceptable erectile function without pharmacutical assist. Hope this helps. Best wishes. - Shu",

      "Content": "Izzat what that is? Left foot had for many years retained more fluid than right, but after the prostatectomy they are equally bloated. Not painful, or even particularly annoying, but noticeable. Persons who have had varicose leg veins stripped (am well acquainted with one such person) have a similar problem. Compression stockings are available up to thigh height and in different compression grades. Larger selection from internet sources than your local pharmacy. Put them on in the morning before getting out of bed, or you have pretty much lost it for the day. Keep legs raised when/where possible during the day. Feet up on a foot-stool when seated. Lie down and raise legs for a rest. Sleep on back with legs on a large, firm pillow. Best wishes, Dog - shu.",

I had already learned that lying flat with the groin area opened up (e.g. right foot drawn up to left inner thigh, right knee laid out to the right side) feels good and seems to help drainage. This would be like the yoga \"tree\" position if done standing Wife and I had not done any yoga for a year or so, but for a while we were quite regular with Susan Winter Ward's program #1 of \"Yoga for the Young at Heart.\" This evening I was trying some of the old stretches and breathing - all done lying on my back on a mat. Worked marvelous well for draining the scrotum. I'd go *very slowly* with this, especially so soon after surgery and if you have not done any yoga before. You just ease into (\"toward\" is probably a better word than \"into\") the positions, as far as your body wants to go, no forcing, no rapid moves, and breath fully and slowly for a few breaths. -shu",

      "Content": "Hi Fatherbuild. I'm 69 yrs old. Had robotic prostatectomy 19 Aug at MD Anderson in Houston. Pain in foot issue I cannot speak to, altho the damaged nerve possibility someone mentioned seems reasonable. Testicular swelling and groin pain, I can speak to. For background: about 2000 I had laproscopic repair of inguinal hernias (both sides). Swollen balls was a real problem - something I was not prepared for. I put this to inadequate briefing before the surgery. Makes sense that there will be a lot more fluid than usual in that region, that it will flow down-hill, and there aint much mechanism to pump it out. It did get better over time, but it was an effect of surgery I had not been mentally prepared to deal with. Also, it got *very* uncomfortable to sit at a desk or drive for more than 30 minutes at a time. The screen patches placed over the ruptured areas, and the swelling as tissue rebuilt around them, blocked circulation and I just could not stay folded for very long. This too got better with time, but it took months. It was about two years before I felt fully normal. Even so, every two or three years I will lift something too heavy, or make an unusual move with a shovel that stresses the area - the ol' scrotum starts to swell, and I need to be careful for a couple of weeks till things firm up again. Back to the present, for the first couple of weeks recovery from the DaVinci prostatectomy seemed to be a \"piece of cake\" compared to recovery from the hernia repairs. Some scrotal swelling, but I was ready for it this time. Then I got too bold and did something that pulled the groin area. So - I'm making a point to spend more time horizontal, stretch the legs out when seated, wear a jock strap over the shorts, and above all try to stifle urges to be \"Mr. Strongman\" around the house and yard. And, yes, it's getting better a bit every day. I don't know your Dad's age, his physical condition before surgery, or activity level after surgery. A qualified medical practitioner - *which I am not* - would have to determine if there is a condition needing surgical or other intervention. But lacking that, with patience and giving his bod. the rest it needs, it all should get better with time. Best wishes - Shu",

      "Content": "Checked this thread before the trip to Houston (300 miles) for the 6 week post-op visit (and return the next day). Could be the relief of the Doc pressing around on the area and pronouncing nothing torn; could be the enforced reduced activity during the trip; could be news of the PSA reading, <0.1 ... but next day after returning home I was walking a lot better, not having to hold my balls in my hand going from place-to-place around the house. So - I'm gonna give a nod to Fairwind for the post above this, and write me some new rules: ....1) indeed, working the inner thigh muscles in walking may have pumping action that helps clear out accumulated fluid. so walk; ....2) any lifting, especially while turning or reaching, any action more vigorous than walking, may set the recovery back and reduce the sustainable pace from a stride to a slow shuffle; ....3) if that happens, just cowboy up and refer to rule 1). Oh. And if any of the boys have need of a guy with good DaVinci fingers, you can go to MD Anderson in Houston and look up Dr. John Davis. We caught this in time so he had a lot to work with, but I gotta say both bladder control and erectile function are \"astonishing\" - well above what I was prepared to accept. -shu",

      "Content": "Newbury - What the other guys said. Anything is possible, but with biopsy of G:3+3=6 and the low PSA, it would be a real outlier case not to be still confined in the prostate and totally fixable by prostatectomy from a competent surgeon. Just speaking from watching the traffic on the board here, and from personal experience. Best wishes - shu Oh, and there's that thing about \"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change ...\"",

      "Content": "Hi Fatherbuild. I'm 69 yrs old. Had robotic prostatectomy 19 Aug at MD Anderson in Houston. Pain in foot issue I cannot speak to, altho the damaged nerve possibility someone mentioned seems reasonable. Testicular swelling and groin pain, I can speak to. For background: about 2000 I had laproscopic repair of inguinal hernias (both sides). Swollen balls was a real problem - something I was not prepared for. I put this to inadequate briefing before the surgery. Makes sense that there will be a lot more fluid than usual in that region, that it will flow down-hill, and there aint much mechanism to pump it out. It did get better over time, but it was an effect of surgery I had not been mentally prepared to deal with. Also, it got *very* uncomfortable to sit at a desk or drive for more than 30 minutes at a time. The screen patches placed over the ruptured areas, and the swelling as tissue rebuilt around them, blocked circulation and I just could not stay folded for very long. This too got better with time, but it took months. It was about two years before I felt fully normal. Even so, every two or three years I will lift something too heavy, or make an unusual move with a shovel that stresses the area - the ol' scrotum starts to swell, and I need to be careful for a couple of weeks till things firm up again. Back to the present, for the first couple of weeks recovery from the DaVinci prostatectomy seemed to be a \"piece of cake\" compared to recovery from the hernia repairs. Some scrotal swelling, but I was ready for it this time. Then I got too bold and did something that pulled the groin area. So - I'm making a point to spend more time horizontal, stretch the legs out when seated, wear a jock strap over the shorts, and above all try to stifle urges to be \"Mr. Strongman\" around the house and yard. And, yes, it's getting better a bit every day. I don't know your Dad's age, his physical condition before surgery, or activity level after surgery. A qualified medical practitioner - *which I am not* - would have to determine if there is a condition needing surgical or other intervention. But lacking that, with patience and giving his bod. the rest it needs, it all should get better with time. Best wishes - Shu",

      "Content": "Checked this thread before the trip to Houston (300 miles) for the 6 week post-op visit (and return the next day). Could be the relief of the Doc pressing around on the area and pronouncing nothing torn; could be the enforced reduced activity during the trip; could be news of the PSA reading, <0.1 ... but next day after returning home I was walking a lot better, not having to hold my balls in my hand going from place-to-place around the house. So - I'm gonna give a nod to Fairwind for the post above this, and write me some new rules: ....1) indeed, working the inner thigh muscles in walking may have pumping action that helps clear out accumulated fluid. so walk; ....2) any lifting, especially while turning or reaching, any action more vigorous than walking, may set the recovery back and reduce the sustainable pace from a stride to a slow shuffle; ....3) if that happens, just cowboy up and refer to rule 1). Oh. And if any of the boys have need of a guy with good DaVinci fingers, you can go to MD Anderson in Houston and look up Dr. John Davis. We caught this in time so he had a lot to work with, but I gotta say both bladder control and erectile function are \"astonishing\" - well above what I was prepared to accept. -shu",

      "Content": "Welcome aboard, Mrs. GG. The numbers look very promising for a complete removal of the cancer with the prostate. Yes, PNI is an item of \"awareness\" or \"interest\" - but not at the level of \"concern,\" and certainly well short of \"panic.\" Nice thing about the surgery treatment path is the whole gland - and usually some surrounding tissue - goes to the pathology lab, so you get a good reading on the situation. Many of us seem to overbuy on incontinence products. Ain't a big worry. Someone on the forum about the time I was going thru the process suggested get a box of large baby diapers, cut them in half (midway between bow and stern) and you will have two absorbent pads. Before you work your way through that pack, you will have a better idea of what you need. I've still got the major part of a box of 50 drip pads on the closet shelf. With any luck, a couple of weeks after catheter removal (say three weeks out from D day) when Hubby is feeling spry enough for lengthy times away from the house, he may just need to stick a couple of spare drip pads in his pocket. Light, loose fitting pants are nice to have for the first couple of weeks after D day. Maybe a string tie or elastic at the waist rather than belt, and legs loose enough to hide the catheter ankle bag. Whatever. As regards personal stats: If you wish, you can click \"Settings\" at upper right of main panel, then \"Edit Signature\" along the left margin of the Settings window. Best wishes to you both. - Shu",

      "Content": "Hey Wheeler - Thanks for the sharing. Keeps the board alive. I had also had previous hernia repairs - one side age 5, other side age 17, both sides again (laproscopic surgery) about age 60. This was a concern when we got the biopsy news. I believe the robotic procedure is favored over open where there are prior hernia repairs. My own recovery from the prostatectomy, as to healing and pains in the groin area, seems to have been more troublesome than most folks on the forum here, but them's the cards I was dealt and it seems mostly stabilized after a year. Nice news on the Gleason downgrade. (It ain't every day we're happy to see one of our scores lowered!) Best wishes - shu",

By \"internal examination\" do you mean the DRE (digital rectal exam - finger-up-the-butt) or biopsy (tissue samples taken by injection needle thru intestinal wall into prostate)? If you are close to one of the large medical centers like MD Anderson in Houston, the Mayo Clinic, etc., perhaps it's time to call in the heavy hitters. Best wishes - shu",

      "Content": "Hey, FedCav. Good to hear from you. Yeah, water doesn't run uphill you know. Whatever mechanism the body has for moving fluids out of the testicles has to work against all that abdominal swelling now. It'll get much better over the next week or 10 days. You can roll up a small towel between your legs for Larry and Roger to lie on while you sleep. When the abdominal swelling goes down you may want to dig through your sock drawer for that old jock strap. For me, it was not as bad as after the double laproscopic hernia repair in 2000. Still have some problems there because of all the hernia work and the prostatectomy on top of it. Anyhow, you say they likely got all the bad stuff out, so your major worry now is Bedford Forrest.

      "Content": "That's a gnarly one, 2Fury. Twentyseven is just too young. But, there it is. The biopsy results seem valid. You asked \"...what would yall recommend?\" Most of us are older. Heck. ALL of us are older than 27. It's hard for me at 70 with the oldest grandchild getting ready for college, to put myself mentally back at 27. But I think the answer is the same. Given that the biopsy is correct, there are three paths available. ..Ignore the problem. Forget about it. Enjoy the life you are living now. Statistically, it's likely to be relatively short and end with bone cancer. ..Resolve to deal with the problem at some future time. Put off the decision. Some folks can handle this better than others. Might find you spend a lot of time worrying about it, obsessing over PSA readings - was that change because of a different lab tech, something you did or ate yesterday? Wait long enough, and a new miracle cure might be found, altho the major treatment paths available now are technically well developed. Wait too long, and you've missed the boat entire. ..Resolve to treat the cancer now. Yeah, the treatment will take time, and life will be different after, but at least there won't be that cancer to worry about. Of the usual treatments, ....prostatectomy will be a harsh month or so, pretty much back to all activities in six months, good prospects for urinary control and erections (but no ejaculate). ....radiation will be a longer course of treatment; you'll keep all your 'nads, but good chance of erectile problems developing later. ....hormones, etc. - can't speak to; I know nothing. I think healthwise - speaking both mental and physical health - I'd make the same decision at 27 as I did at 69. The hard part is the kids issue. There are ways around it - banking sperm, as you say, or adoption. Hang in there, kid. -shu (F4 Phantoms, DaNang, 1967-",

Funnin' around with what you eat as a cancer preventative is maybe OK, but once the biopsy shows it's there, then the fun stops and you best be looking at serious medically proven methods for *treatment*. Moderator may tell you them's kinda the rules for discussion on this particular board. The stats you report do call for serious treatment. Most guys here, as it happens, seem to opt for surgery. Radiation is effective, statistically about the same as surgery if caught in time, and many do go that route. Surgery removes the prostate for a detailed pathology report. With the prostate gone, an undetectable PSA level points to no cancer escaped or left behind. These are mental comfort features that radiation treatments do not provide.

      "Content": "Bravehardon #7 above. True. A lot of surgeons out there with prostatectomy operation counts over 1,000. Since most of us have only one prostate, it would follow there is a large number of men who have had prostate removal surgery. Add in the number of radiation patients. Consider that prostate cancer is the most common type among males. Shucks. Could be another guy on your same block; half dozen or more in a large apartment complex. But they're all trying to keep it a secret? And, yes, it does get easier with the passage of time to share - often beginning with anonymous sharing on a web forum. My suggestion, wear it like a badge of honor. Happen to meet an old High School chum or co-worker, drop a remark in: \"BTW. I had to leave my prostate in Houston last year. If you ain't getting a poke in the butt and PSA check once a year, you should be.\" - Shu",

      "Content": "Greetings, Glock19. Didn't notice any age reference in yr profile, but will take it as correct you are 70. If you are in good physical condition, surgery is certainly do-able. Mine was at 69 1/2. Whole prostate comes out for a complete pathology report. Only problem post-surgery (aside from the occasional dribble of urine, and dry orgasms) was circulation in groin area and drainage from testicles. I'd had several hernia repairs, and the prostatectomy doc said he found and patched a few more. The major cure for that was giving up my favored Concept2 aerobic rower and getting their stand-up SkiErg. Made the problem manageable. Oh, and G26 is my carry. Shoulder holster is appropriate for a while post-surgery. Very best wishes - Shu",

Anything's possible, but with just one out of twelve showing positive, probably G6, and the Doc suggesting Active Surveillance as appropriate, it's way more likely whatever you have is still contained in the prostate. Hey, you're past fifty, Dude. You gonna start picking up some joint pains. Review the biopsy results, get a PSA and finger poke regularly - whatever you work out with the Docs. You should make at least a Plan A for treatment (surgery or radiation) and set trigger points (maybe appearance of a Gleason 7 core) for activating that plan, but we don't see any reason to short yourself on sleep tonight. Oh - and Welcome Aboard. - Shu Ron G - Urologist who did my biopsy said \"sometimes we do a bone scan, but I don't think one is necessary here.\" MD Anderson, which did the surgery, did not do any scans either. I don't know what their decisions were based on - number of positive cores, location of cores, looking at pathology slides?? Maybe MD Anderson thought \"we're gonna take it out in a month anyhow, we can look at the margins then.\" I do see, in the threads here, bone scans seem to be done well more often than not. Maybe it's just the Doc's wanting to be safe, or establish a base-line.",

At four weeks you may still be feeling and acting some like an invalid. At six weeks - which was my post-op visit with surgeon - you should be ready for most normal activities.

      "Content": "Hello Function. Full Disclosure: this particular Forum does seem to lean toward surgery as primaryl treatment. (Thankfully we have contributors who go with radiation, ASAdvocate, and guys with recurrence issues to keep me on top of things.) You noted one of the +points for surgery; I assume you are aware of others: full assay of the cancer by the pathologist, confident test for clean catch by PSA drop to undetectable, etc. As you noted (and experience of my Father and brothers confirm) radiation effects show up later. Return to work at two weeks may be a bit optimistic - IF you have a short commute, have a desk job, don't mind shuffling rather than walking swiftly, and are willing to get up and walk around every 30-40 minutes. Return at 4 weeks is more realistic. Prostatectomy is serious surgery (well, cancer is a serious disease!!) and there are those aboard the Forum who have had recovery issues. Wilde and (IIRC) DogDollar come to mind. That said (and I don't say this often, knock on wood) I was just short of age 70 at surgery; at the 6 week follow up I went with maybe just a drip pad in the skivies and had serviceable erections. I think this is close to the common recovery trajectory. As to urinary continence we lose the sphincter near the prostate, but have in reserve a sphincter in the pelvic floor muscles. That is how the ladies are plumbed, so how bad can that be. We just need to learn to use it. Erectile function is more problematic. Depends on what the surgeon finds when he goes in, and the quality of his \"hands.\" At Gleason 8, were I you, I'd cut that sucker out and be thankful for whatever followed. Very best wishes to you, Function. Do stay on board and keep us informed. - shu",

I had laproscopic hernia repair (left and right) in 2001. Sitting in a normal office brought pain at the fold of the groin after a short time. This gradually got better, but it was a full year before I could sit normally for a long time. Two years before I felt fully back to normal. The daVinci operation a year ago was much the same, but not quite as severe. You can search up some of my posts on the forum, if you care to. Tissue layers in the lower abdomen were separated to create the operating cavity. They need to patch themselves together. Water don't normally run up-hill, ya know, and fluids are going to collect in the testicles, have a harder than usual time making it back up through the swollen groin. Yes, it does feel a lot like a hernia - same dull pain of restricted circulation. If you've had it checked by the doc and he says no hernia, than just back off and give it time to heal.

      "Content": "Alpine - With a Gleason score of 7 and a palpable mass on the prostate, it is time for treatment by conventional means. Diet, clean living, etc. will have no meaningful effect on the progress of the disease. Hormone treatment may suppress growth of the tumor(s). Radiation (several treatment methods are available) can kill the tumor in place. Surgical removal of the prostate will remove a contained tumor and leave available the option of radiation treatment if it is later found some cancer cells were left behind. Although we are not medical practitioners, I think all on the Forum will agree that given the conditions you describe, it is time for serious action. Best wishes - Shu246",

I'll give a cautious vote for air travel, noting the lack of flexibility vs. car, and suggesting longer than \"two extra days\" at Baltimore. Correct about not sitting for long periods. Two hour flight time, plus the extra ramp time, should be do-able. First class seat and board last would be good. With air travel changing your return date can be a problem, and there are bag-drags at the airports. For us, MD Anderson at Houston is a 300 mile trip. We did not even consider air travel. Available surgery dates were Monday and Thursday (pre-dawn show-up) with some appointments the day prior. There is a hotel in the campus grounds, connected by skyways to the hospital. We picked the Monday surgery date and booked a kitchenet room for a Thursday arrival, through Wednesday (13 nights, just to be extra cautious). Made an appointment with the local Urologist on D+9 for catheter removal. Pre-op appointments Friday; Saturday to sight-see around Houston; Sunday for tending to the bowel purge routine and fasting. I took two nights (Monday, Tuesday) in the hospital - perhaps because of my age or more surgery problems for the Doc to work with prior hernia repairs. Wednesday morning I was slouching around hanging onto a spare IV tree or pushing a wheel chair for support, and anxious to get back to the hotel room. By Friday I could slow-walk around the hospital grounds or local stores without looking or feeling like an idiot. (Bring some loose string-tie pants.) But I still had not had a bowel movement, was starting to feel rather packed up and a bit concerned. That finally came, with great relief, early hours Saturday. I felt ready to travel. It was early enough we could have left that day, but being old folks we took Saturday to slowly pack the car and rest. Wife did most of the work and all the driving, of course.

      "Content": "Warrior - So sorry to hear this. Thoughts from a guy who was just short of age 70 at surgery, family business (copier sales & service) for several years, happiest with chainsaw, on tractor, or in front of computer. Penile discharge I cannot speak to, but definitely get it sorted out by his surgeon or urologist!!! Pain in groin and scrotum, yeah plenty of that. But let's put it in perspective. He is, as you say, about three months out of surgery. I had double laproscopic hernia repair about age 58. It was a full year before I could sit (computer or driving) for more than 45 minutes without intense and growing pain in the crease of the legs. Two years until that surgery was all a faded memory. The prostatectomy was easier in that regard, thank you, but still ... it's abdominal surgery, you gotta remember, and fluid (like in the testicles) does not ordinarily run uphill. The whole area has been worked over and everything is swollen and trying to find its place again. Blood and lymph passages up from the testicles and in the groin will be compressed. Roll up a towel and stick it between the legs at night to keep the stuff elevated, if it helps. Put on a jock strap over the undershorts in the day; night time too, if it helps. Don't be seated longer than 30-40 minutes without getting up and walking around a few minutes. Three years out from the prostatectomy, it's all ancient history. Unless....... Tried to tweek up the drag on the exercise machine a couple of weeks ago. Couple of days of that, and the twins commenced to get heavy and started getting tangled between the thighs. A few days with the jock strap on, and everybody's back in place. Then there is the part about being \"an active type guy\" and the restriction of lifting more than xx lb for yy weeks after surgery. Don't know about your Hubby, but some guys may tend to push the limits. Don't ask me to say more about that. As to your moniker of \"Warrior\" there was a single frame cartoon I remember from years ago. Crane has a frog in it's beak, trying to swallow it. Frog has hands around crane's neck trying to choke it. Caption is \"Never Give Up!\" Hope this helps, and wishing you and Hubby happier times ahead. - shu Oh, and kudos for pestering the guy about annual DRE and PSA. Really.",

      "Content": "Ouch. Sad tail indeed. Hope it all works out for you. Yeah, yr balls are gonna get huge for a while. Water doesn't run up-hill, ya'know. The whole area down there has been worked over pretty well, and it'll be a few weeks before the normal mechanisms for moving fluids from the testicles get back to working well. IIRC the thing about the catheter is: there are many reasons for having/needing a catheter. If somebody just shows up in the ER and needs catheterization, and it is not mentioned that the patient had prostatectomy - the prostate removed and the bladder sutured back to the utrethra - the ER folks could unintentionally damage the surgery area. We haven't had much experience with hospitals, but we're finding that many places allow the spouse or close relative to stay overnight - may even offer some sheets and a blanket to make up a bed in the recliner in the room. And we're beginning to understand that even in the best hospitals, having a family member present 24 hrs is REALLY A GOOD IDEA. The staff, bless their hearts, have a lot to do I guess. Should start to get better for you soon. Here's hoping. =shu",

Yes as Chuck said - and with the caveats that .. we are not medical practitioners, just folks who have crossed paths with prostate cancer, and .. all prostate cancer cases are different - PSA of 1.7 is well within normal range. Get a PSA blood test and DRE (digital rectal exam, aka finger up the butt) every year. I started checking at age 40 because of prostate cancers in both maternal and paternal lines. A free/total PSA test, done with the same blood draw, also provides information. Try to use the same lab every year. Keep track of the numbers and trends. Prostate cancers generally grow slowly. If treated before any cancer cells wander off to other parts of the body, prospect for complete \"cure\" is good. Just keep a watch on it. Check out my \"signature\" comments below.

      "Content": "Could be the reason they call you \"Lucky\" Pierre. Yes as Chuck said - and with the caveats that .. we are not medical practitioners, just folks who have crossed paths with prostate cancer, and .. all prostate cancer cases are different - PSA of 1.7 is well within normal range. Get a PSA blood test and DRE (digital rectal exam, aka finger up the butt) every year. I started checking at age 40 because of prostate cancers in both maternal and paternal lines. A free/total PSA test, done with the same blood draw, also provides information. Try to use the same lab every year. Keep track of the numbers and trends. Prostate cancers generally grow slowly. If treated before any cancer cells wander off to other parts of the body, prospect for complete \"cure\" is good. Just keep a watch on it. Check out my \"signature\" comments below. Best wishes, Pierre - Shu",

By the time back pain from prostate cancer is evident, the cancer is well out of the prostate and spread to the bones.

      "Content": "I've had two biopsies. First was about year 2000. It was endurable, but in no way pleasant. A carrier shroud for the spring-needle core collector was clipped over the ultrasound head (which was big enough allready, thank you!). Once inserted in the rectum, much maneuvering around to position for each sample shot. Twelves stabs in the prostate - and, yes, there are nerves there!. Mild shock after driving myself home; blood clots in ejaculate for a couple of weeks afterward. For the biopsy in 2013 the Uro. (different guy) suggested an anesthetic. I readily agreed. Tech from the hospital next door to the clinic came in. The knock-out was about on the level of colonoscopy - no consciousness, no pain, less after-shock than the first biopsy. The biopsy is necessary if you want the information it will provide, but something to be endured rather than enjoyed. I'd have done the second one without hesitation, but was glad when the Uro (unprompted) offered an anesthetic. - Shu",

      "Content": "wbigs - Had left inguinal hernia repaired at age 5, right side at age 18. Both sides laproscopic repair w/ patches at age 58 (I think dropping 8 feet out of a tree I was trimming, and landing flat on my feet was what did it). After the bilateral laproscopic repairs, lengthy sitting caused pains in the groin area. Gradually got better over two years. Still, every six months or so I'd do something that felt like things had broken loose. Indeed, about three weeks before the prostatectomy I was cleaning up a confined space, lifted a chunk of concrete rubble and twisted upper body to side. Fortunately, as on previous occasions, a week or two avoiding such exertions firmed the area up again. At pre-surgery consults I had asked the Doc about prior hernias. He said that did not normally rule out surgery as a prostate cancer treatment, and that robotic was better than open. Doc had several thousand operations; his usual schedule was \"three on Monday, three on Thursday). In the short term, first six months, recovery from the prostatectomy was easier than from the earlier bilateral repair. Long term, three years out from surgery, the groin area is less tolerant of abuse from prolonged sitting or heavy lifting. I guess at 72 y.o. maybe it's time to cut back a little. My avatar, spike of a flowering agave plant in our front yard, was chosen as a tribute to the nerve sparing surgery of Dr. John Davis at MD Anderson. The oak tree in the background was taken down mostly without assistance two years after the prostatectomy. WBigs, you should give strict adherence to the lifting restrictions post surgery. Just sayin',,, Best wishes - Shu",

      "Content": "PSA is a blood test - unless there is something I don't know about. Urine sample is easy enough and likely collected routinely by urologists, but not used for PSA. There is another metric from the PSA blood sample that is of interest - the \"free to total PSA ratio.\" For this, the higher the better. Above 25% is good news. Below 10% would be cause for concern. Trend of the numbers over time - both the total PSA and the F/T ratio - is helpful in pointing to possibility of cancer. For trending to be meaningful however, it is important that the analysis all be run by the same laboratory. These, along with DRE (digital rectal exam; finger poke) done yearly or more often if called for, are relatively inexpensive and non-invasive. The first tier diagnostic tools. Next level tool, more expensive and more invasive, is the biopsy. Good tool, but still a scattershot sample and could miss hitting an existing tumor. I could be wrong about this, but I'm thinking back pain or other \"symptoms\" are *not* helpful or reliable first indicators of prostate cancer. By the time back pain from prostate cancer is evident, the cancer is well out of the prostate and spread to the bones. I had for years a frequent need to urinate but without much production; kept pestering the Urologist about bladder infection etc. Finally figured it was due to nerves getting pinched by squashed discs in the lower back. That was decades before any detectable prostate cancer developed. When prostate cancer was found - as a result of yearly PSA and DRE monitoring, confirmed by biopsy - it was early enough for treatment with good chance of complete containment.

Early the second morning I swapped out the catheter bed bag for the leg bag, threw on some PJ bottoms and a robe, scrounged up an empty IV tree for support, and slouched down to the Starbucks at the main cafeteria with Wife.

      "Content": "Day 22 - having passed the \"Don't lift anything heavier than 5/10/15 lb.\" (depending on source being quoted) mark. GENERAL PROGRESS: good. Actually some regression or lack of progress in the past week, due to pushing the activity level. Most problems in the area of groin/scrotum drainage (see section below). On Day 14 I wrestled the dead battery out of the riding lawn mower, and wrestled the new one in. On Day 20 I mowed some of the lawn, did some bush trimming with chain saw, and pried some large weeds out of the North Pasture. That was too much. Making effort now to stay horizontal more of the day, cycle more water during the day, fight temptation to get on the tractor and do some dirt work. PAIN: no problem. Left off the Rx narcotic pain pills after Week 1 and the 300 mile ride home from Houston. Extra strength Tylenol for another week, then nothing. Surface wounds healing nicely. \"Super glue\" mostly peeled off. Three of the six incision sites have a small absorbable-thread suture. BLADDER CONTROL: somewhere between \"good as can be expected\" and \"astonishing.\" Peed during sleep on two of the first four nights after the urinary catheter came out (day 10). No problems since then. Keep a precautionary absorbent/impermeable pad on the bed. Left off any absorbent pad in the shorts last night, to allow for better scrotal mobility and drainage. Watch fluid intake two hours before bed time. Some nights awake to pee at two hour intervals (vice 3.5) which may interfere with getting into full REM sleep state. Daytime, excepting a small ocassional dribble or squirt, I pee or hold as usual. Pre-operative, had ocassional intense urge to urinate with only partially filled bladder. Believe this is a pinched nerve issue, related to squashed discs in lower spine. No change here. Volume flow rate, which had begun to decrease \"noticeably\" (but not \"troublingly\") pre-operative, is increased. There is a \"burning\" sensation (hardly dignifiable by the label \"pain\") during urination, which seems to be at the suture site of bladder neck and urethra. ERECTILE FUNCTION: good as can be expected. This was not a problem pre-operative. Twenty-one days is also the marker for starting some manual stimulation - and another area I'll admit to pushing the prescribed/recommended schedule. Nothing approaching a genuine boner, but about what you'd expect for having an inch or so cut out of your urethra. BOWEL FUNCTION AND RECTAL: a lot of tenderness, hemroids. I've never been attentive to proper hydration or regular bowel movements. Post-operative I've kept with the ducosate sodium stool softener (had never before used these, nor any laxatives). Hydration, not so much. Bowel movements have been generally regular and without much straining. Eating has been heavy, particularly the first week post-operative. I think the antibiotic enema on the day pre-operative killed off much of the beneficial digestive gut fauna. There is much tenderness in the area, and some fluid leaking. I suspect the Surgeons stuck various wands in there to position organs for the robot fingers. GROIN/SCROTUM: the most bothersome area. Much of the groin swelling and scrotal drainage problem can likely be laid to the bi-lateral inguinal hernia repair meshes of ten years ago. About every two years since I've done something to over-stress the area, required a week or two to firm up again. Surgeon's notes indicate work-around of these patches added 30 minutes to his normal time for the operation. Meanwhile, I'm walking slow and slightly bow-legged; making a point to stay horizontal when possible for good drainage.",

      "Content": "Agreed, the Gleason 8 and a palpable nodule point to selecting and getting on with a path of treatment without undue delay. Yet panic at this point is both unhelpful and uncalled for. Only 2 of 13 cores in the biopsy showing cancerous is good to hear. Likewise there seems to be no suggestion yet of metastasis. Plenty of folks have recovered from far worse. A few weeks to study the options, any additional tests, and make a decision for action; then schedule the the selected treatment. A small number of months between initial diagnosis and start of treatment seems to be typical. After reviewing the options, and if further tests suggest no spread beyond the prostate, and your Dad is otherwise in generally good health, he may opt for removal of the prostate. This would leave available options for radiation or other treatments if some cancer cells had remained behind. While perhaps startling to contemplate at first - to remove the prostate the urethra is cut at entrance and exit of the gland, exterior nerves and other tissue carefully peeled away, and the lower urethra stitched back to the base of the bladder - the procedure is quite commonly done. Both 'open' (hands on) and 'robotic' (remote controlled mechanical arms through small incisions) are done. Look for a surgeon with several hundred operations experience. This might be at a major university teaching hospital. My surgeon had perhaps over two thousand operations; his normal week was three on Monday, three on Thursday. And, yes, if you would mention your father's age, any other important medical problems, and some PSA readings, it would help align our comments more closely to your Dad's circumstances.

I had not given much study on what to eat, and post-op just tried to refill the gut with soft, fiber and roughage rich fare. Operation day was Monday. We were in the Rotary House hotel there on the MD Anderson campus. By Thursday evening I had got all the gas out but was beginning to feel righteous well packed up from the food. About 2:00AM Friday I woke up Wife, we hopped in the car and went driving around looking for a more serious laxative. You would think there would be an all-night pharmacy in Houston close to the Texas Medical Center, but none that we found. Not on Holcomb Blvd., not on Main St. Found a stop-n-rob on Main that was at least open, locked up and selling stuff through a slot under a bullet proof glass window, but nothing in the laxative dept. to offer. So, back to the hotel. The venture did involve a fair amount of walking, and maybe that exercise and turning the gut did the trick. Immediately hit the throne room and was magnanimously rewarded. After that, as they say, the rest was easy. Wishing you an equally glorious outcome. - Shu",

      "Content": "Hi ChiliDog. Welcome to the forum I feel qualified to speak on this, being about the same age as your Hubby - at least as to the surgery. Enervating effects of radiation or drug treatments, I have no experience. I say no reason to jump the gun quitting work. In about year 2000 I had abdominal surgery - laproscopic hernia repair, both sides. Prostatectomy was August, 2013. Following both surgeries it took a month or so to return to most normal activities not involving feats of strength. For about a year following, it was painful to stay seated for more than a half hour at a time. This may not be the case for normal prostatectomy, but for me where hernia areas were involved, it was.

      "Content": "Hi ChiliDog. Welcome to the forum I feel qualified to speak on this, being about the same age as your Hubby - at least as to the surgery. Enervating effects of radiation or drug treatments, I have no experience. I say no reason to jump the gun quitting work. In about year 2000 I had abdominal surgery - laproscopic hernia repair, both sides. Prostatectomy was August, 2013. Following both surgeries it took a month or so to return to most normal activities not involving feats of strength. For about a year following, it was painful to stay seated for more than a half hour at a time. This may not be the case for normal prostatectomy, but for me where hernia areas were involved, it was. The solution in 2000 was to get a chair that sets in a kneeling type posture. This time I just got some spare 2x4s and plywood, and slapped together a U shaped riser to make a 'stand-up' desk. Added benefit, the computer now fits on the floor under the desk, the back-up power supply and wiring is out of view behind the riser. Also, bought a drawing table stool to sit on.

At age 57 you may be wanting to get more mileage out of your prostate than I did at close to 70. That might skew the decision toward radiation if/when active treatment is needed. Sex after surgery is still good, just a lot less messy. Gives new meaning to the phrase \"dry humping.\" But, yeah - I think most of the guys on the board here go for the surgery first. Done early, before the horse gets out of the barn and into the lymph nodes etc., by an experienced operating team, prospects for post surgery bladder control and erectile function are good. If the pathology report on the prostate shows containment, and the PSA is undetectable (<0.1) at the 6 week check, chances are very good you are clear of the cancer. But do let us know what you decide, and give us some progress checks. It's a good crew here, willing to share their stories. - shu",

      "Content": "Mimi - Can't speak with authority to your question of why the low PSA. With family members in both paternal and maternal lines having/had PC, I started testing early. I was surprised, but compliant, when the urologist wanted a biopsy at PSA 4.0. Glad that he did. I'd say yr husband's biopsy results are what they are. If you believe them, and have selected surgery, then focus on getting ready for that. After that, settle back and wait on the pathology report - which will be released whenever it is ready. Examining the whole prostate and other removed material, along with the 6 week post-op PSA test will give a high confidence level report on whether/or not the cancer was entirely removed. Unfortunately, the operation is not reversible. It'd be nice if we could clean up the prostate and put it back in place like the carburetor on an engine. BTW, I noticed several folks posting the size of their prostate from the path. report, so I went back and looked up my own. Comparatively rather small. Perhaps that is a factor in low PSA reading vs. Gleason score. Best wishes, - shu",

      "Content": "What they said, mostly. As to pain post operative, you will likely be prescribed some heavy duty pain killer pills on release from the hospital. I took one or two, but found Advil was all that was needed. Most of us here, I think, were the same. Actual pain from the surgical wounds is not a worry. The CO2 gas needed to create the operating cavity was, for me, no problem at all - just a lot of farting. Shoulder pain from the position we are placed on the operating table, likewise was not an issue for me. The catheter can trigger sudden and intense bladder spasms, but keep the tip of the penis lubricated and should be no problem. After you start walking, the catheter is mostly must an annoyance to drag the bag around around and empty it, and an occasional distracting tug on your Johnson. Catheter removal is a non-issue. Slips right out like taking a whizz. First bowel movement is a major event. But about day 3 or 4 when you really start worrying, it'll all work out. Just watch what you eat - soft foods, soft fiber, stool softeners on schedule. A lot of discomforts, but not much real pain. By about day 3 you'll have figured out how to move around. After that, the problem is mostly to hold yourself back from trying too much too soon. There is a lot more healing needs to take place inside than the few surface cuts indicate. Rest and relax Monday, do the bowel purge stuff and fasting, you'll do fine. Best wishes - Shu",

      "Content": "Hey, Bow - Prostatectomy is serious surgery, but also *very* commonly done. A good team will have done many procecures, seen and handled just about every problem likely to come up. There is really not a lot of pain involved. Likely you will get some high power pain meds on leaving the hospital, but most of us seems to just get on with over-the-counter stuff after the first day. The catheter is mostly a non-issue. Yeah, you will have a bag strapped to your ankle for a week or so. Keep the tip of the urethra clean and lubed. Don't push too hard getting back to normal duty - there is a lot more healing needs be done inside compared to the few cuts on the surface. Give it a couple of months. Do keep up with simple walking - gets blood flowing through the area and keeps gentle stretching during healing. Urinary control and erections vary widely with individuals. We lose the urinary sphincter at the prostate, and so are left with just the pelvic floor sphincter - the same equipment as the ladies have for urinary control. If tumors are not piercing the prostate shell, a good surgery team should leave the erectile nerves with minimal trauma. If not, and erections are important, there are other means. Having got the cancer out is a major mental comfort. Best wishes for you - Shu",

      "Content": "Mario - Take ten slow deep breaths and relax. The usual way to determine if cancer is actually present is with a biopsy - taking some random core samples by way of a spring-fired needle mounted on an ultrasound head - the whole affair inserted through the anus. This procedure is not enjoyable in any way, but is endurable, and is done locally in the urologist's office. Something to keep in mind, the biopsy is *just* a random sampling. Usually if cancer is there the biopsy will rake in some of it, but since it is just a sampling it will not give a full and complete picture. So - if you are a worrier - there you are. It's what we have to deal with. The good news: 1) prostate cancers usually grow slowly, so panic is not called for here; 2) a PSA of 2 with an intact prostate is like nothing (I am not a medical professional, but that is my take on it); and 3) re-read point #1. If the urologist says not to worry, I'd be inclined to believe him/her. But to settle your mind you could always gather up the lab reports and run them by another urologist for a second opinion. Best wishes, -shu",

      "Content": "Tim - My first post-op bowel movement - blessed and most welcome event - was at D+3.5. I don't recall any particular dietary restrictions; was two nights in the hospital, and there were no restrictions on meal menus. Out of the hospital, my plan was to get the gut restocked. I went for soft roughage - pinto beans, salad greens, soft vegetables - and plenty of fluids to avoid the system having to draw moisture from the intestines. At three and a half days the gut commenced rumbling. This was 0200 hrs in the AM. We drove around for an hour looking for an all night pharmacy or someplace to score some laxatives. No joy. Back to the hotel. Within a half hour I was on the throne gettin it done. After that it was all normal-normal gastro-intestinal wise. Hope this helps. Best wishes. Shu",

      "Content": "Hi McNova - I'm thinking most here would agree at Gleason 6 that active surveillance is a reasonable choice - keeping in mind of course that the biopsy is just a random sample, there could be something more nefarious lurking undetected. Most here would agree, I think, that Gleason 7 (particularly if it's 4+3=7 rather than 3+4=7), at age 67 if your Dad is in generally good health, it's time to select and move forward with some treatment method. For us, at age 69 1/2, receiving the news of the biopsy cold, we went from zero to decision for surgery in probably less than 5 minutes. Among other considerations I wanted to get it done before I got any older, and before the Afraudable Care Act created more spread between Health Insurance and actual Health Care. Prostatectomy, either 'hands-in' or 'robotic' is actually a rather routine procedure. Best done sooner than later, before any tumor(s) gets away from the site. Yes, there is a percentage for incontinence or sexual function problems; We were in otherwise good health, just on the opposite side of the cusp from your Dad's Gleason 6, and were ready to accept the percentages. There is, of course, the alternative of radiation treatment. The decision of what, if any, treatment is of course your Father's. Best wishes - shu",

      "Content": "What they said, mostly. As to pain post operative, you will likely be prescribed some heavy duty pain killer pills on release from the hospital. I took one or two, but found Advil was all that was needed. Most of us here, I think, were the same. Actual pain from the surgical wounds is not a worry. The CO2 gas needed to create the operating cavity was, for me, no problem at all - just a lot of farting. Shoulder pain from the position we are placed on the operating table, likewise was not an issue for me. The catheter can trigger sudden and intense bladder spasms, but keep the tip of the penis lubricated and should be no problem. After you start walking, the catheter is mostly must an annoyance to drag the bag around around and empty it, and an occasional distracting tug on your Johnson. Catheter removal is a non-issue. Slips right out like taking a whizz. First bowel movement is a major event. But about day 3 or 4 when you really start worrying, it'll all work out. Just watch what you eat - soft foods, soft fiber, stool softeners on schedule. A lot of discomforts, but not much real pain. By about day 3 you'll have figured out how to move around. After that, the problem is mostly to hold yourself back from trying too much too soon. There is a lot more healing needs to take place inside than the few surface cuts indicate. Rest and relax Monday, do the bowel purge stuff and fasting, you'll do fine. Best wishes - Shu",

      "Content": "For me, about 4 hours in surgery; 2 nights in hospital. Am thinking three hours and one night are closer to the average. I had previous hernia patches the Docs had to work around or break loose, and was just short of 70 yrs old at the time. Other folks in the cohort were walking around more easily than I after the first overnight, but I didn't feel ready till after a full day of rest. Early the second morning I swapped out the catheter bed bag for the leg bag, threw on some PJ bottoms and a robe, scrounged up an empty IV tree for support, and slouched down to the Starbucks at the main cafeteria with Wife. I was ready to get released. Best wishes - shu",

      "Content": "Agreed, the Gleason 8 and a palpable nodule point to selecting and getting on with a path of treatment without undue delay. Yet panic at this point is both unhelpful and uncalled for. Only 2 of 13 cores in the biopsy showing cancerous is good to hear. Likewise there seems to be no suggestion yet of metastasis. Plenty of folks have recovered from far worse. A few weeks to study the options, any additional tests, and make a decision for action; then schedule the the selected treatment. A small number of months between initial diagnosis and start of treatment seems to be typical. After reviewing the options, and if further tests suggest no spread beyond the prostate, and your Dad is otherwise in generally good health, he may opt for removal of the prostate. This would leave available options for radiation or other treatments if some cancer cells had remained behind. While perhaps startling to contemplate at first - to remove the prostate the urethra is cut at entrance and exit of the gland, exterior nerves and other tissue carefully peeled away, and the lower urethra stitched back to the base of the bladder - the procedure is quite commonly done. Both 'open' (hands on) and 'robotic' (remote controlled mechanical arms through small incisions) are done. Look for a surgeon with several hundred operations experience. This might be at a major university teaching hospital. My surgeon had perhaps over two thousand operations; his normal week was three on Monday, three on Thursday. And, yes, if you would mention your father's age, any other important medical problems, and some PSA readings, it would help align our comments more closely to your Dad's circumstances.

      "Content": "Frency - Let your body be your guide, and don't push it too hard. After a double laproscopic hernia repair about 2000, it was a great while before I could sit for longer than 30 minutes without developing pains in the creases of the groin. It was about two years post surgery until \"like it never happened\" - except for some groin pain for a few days after heavy or twisting lifting. Recovery after the DaVinci RP was easier than the hernia repairs - generally \"like it never happened\" after one year post surgery. Yet there are still groin pains after an hour of computer sitting. My exercise of choice was the Concept2 air-drag rower (groin compressions deeper than cycling). I never could get back up to my pre-daVinci workout lengths of 10K meters. After two years, gave up and got Concept2's stand-up SkiErg. I'm back on the rower some now - can tolerate 2-3K meters daily. Best wishes - Shu And, yes, in the month or so between preliminary appointment at MD Anderson and the daVinci gig, I kicked up the workouts a bit - both to stay busy, displace worry, and to trim a few pounds to give the Docs a cleaner deck.",

      "Content": "Hi ChiliDog. Welcome to the forum I feel qualified to speak on this, being about the same age as your Hubby - at least as to the surgery. Enervating effects of radiation or drug treatments, I have no experience. I say no reason to jump the gun quitting work. In about year 2000 I had abdominal surgery - laproscopic hernia repair, both sides. Prostatectomy was August, 2013. Following both surgeries it took a month or so to return to most normal activities not involving feats of strength. For about a year following, it was painful to stay seated for more than a half hour at a time. This may not be the case for normal prostatectomy, but for me where hernia areas were involved, it was. The solution in 2000 was to get a chair that sets in a kneeling type posture. This time I just got some spare 2x4s and plywood, and slapped together a U shaped riser to make a 'stand-up' desk. Added benefit, the computer now fits on the floor under the desk, the back-up power supply and wiring is out of view behind the riser. Also, bought a drawing table stool to sit on. As for the rest of it, about three months ago I took down and chainsawed into firewood the 2 foot diameter oak tree in my avatar picture. Tell Hubby to keep at it as long as he wants. - shu",

      "Content": "Ron - A warm welcome, and thank you for sharing. The dissonance between rather stable PSA 4.1 and biopsy G:7 with the pathology result are surprising - illustrating that the biopsy is just a random sample, and that all PC cases are different. The 8 of 12 cores positive maybe were a pointer to larger involvement. Yes, good call to have done the surgery and cleared out the bulk of the bad stuff. All together, confirms why we \"instantly\" selected surgery when we were presented with the biopsy news. Pathology of the removed prostate provides the best information about the cancer. Radiation can be used after prostatectomy to punch back any residual cancer; surgery after radiation as the primary treatment, not so much. You indicate (at 09:30 post above) that DRE was done, prostate was enlarged. But no nodules or deformation felt?? Thank you again for sharing your information; very helpful to guys coming into the Board. And very, very best wishes to you in treatment! - Shu",

Same as a baby: change the pad when wet, clean and dry the area, apply powder or oil on the skin. I'd not let that worry affect your treatment decision. If you are in good physical condition, do kegel exercises to shape-up the pelvic floor muscles, and no unusual problems with the surgery, you may just have minor leakage and only for a few weeks.

      "Content": "Just my opinion, Izzic, but I don't think it is a common problem, and should in any event be manageable. Same as a baby: change the pad when wet, clean and dry the area, apply powder or oil on the skin. I'd not let that worry affect your treatment decision. If you are in good physical condition, do kegel exercises to shape-up the pelvic floor muscles, and no unusual problems with the surgery, you may just have minor leakage and only for a few weeks.

      "Content": "Frency - Let your body be your guide, and don't push it too hard. After a double laproscopic hernia repair about 2000, it was a great while before I could sit for longer than 30 minutes without developing pains in the creases of the groin. It was about two years post surgery until \"like it never happened\" - except for some groin pain for a few days after heavy or twisting lifting. Recovery after the DaVinci RP was easier than the hernia repairs - generally \"like it never happened\" after one year post surgery. Yet there are still groin pains after an hour of computer sitting. My exercise of choice was the Concept2 air-drag rower (groin compressions deeper than cycling). I never could get back up to my pre-daVinci workout lengths of 10K meters. After two years, gave up and got Concept2's stand-up SkiErg. I'm back on the rower some now - can tolerate 2-3K meters daily. Best wishes - Shu And, yes, in the month or so between preliminary appointment at MD Anderson and the daVinci gig, I kicked up the workouts a bit - both to stay busy, displace worry, and to trim a few pounds to give the Docs a cleaner deck.",

      "Content": "Agreed, the Gleason 8 and a palpable nodule point to selecting and getting on with a path of treatment without undue delay. Yet panic at this point is both unhelpful and uncalled for. Only 2 of 13 cores in the biopsy showing cancerous is good to hear. Likewise there seems to be no suggestion yet of metastasis. Plenty of folks have recovered from far worse. A few weeks to study the options, any additional tests, and make a decision for action; then schedule the the selected treatment. A small number of months between initial diagnosis and start of treatment seems to be typical. After reviewing the options, and if further tests suggest no spread beyond the prostate, and your Dad is otherwise in generally good health, he may opt for removal of the prostate. This would leave available options for radiation or other treatments if some cancer cells had remained behind. While perhaps startling to contemplate at first - to remove the prostate the urethra is cut at entrance and exit of the gland, exterior nerves and other tissue carefully peeled away, and the lower urethra stitched back to the base of the bladder - the procedure is quite commonly done. Both 'open' (hands on) and 'robotic' (remote controlled mechanical arms through small incisions) are done. Look for a surgeon with several hundred operations experience. This might be at a major university teaching hospital. My surgeon had perhaps over two thousand operations; his normal week was three on Monday, three on Thursday. And, yes, if you would mention your father's age, any other important medical problems, and some PSA readings, it would help align our comments more closely to your Dad's circumstances.

      "Content": "Sincere condolences on your loss, Ampersand. Others may correct me, as I may be wrong on this. Hormone therapy can suppress prostate activity - thus reduce the rate of prostate cancer growth. Hormone therapy will neither remove the cancer nor kill it in place - thus it cannot be a true \"cure.\" Moreover, messing with hormones can bring unwelcome physical and psychological effects - hot flashes, reduced sexual libido, etc. Relevant questions are: what courses of treatment were offered to your Father; what course did he select; and did he follow the course he selected. The choice of treatment, and holding to it, are the patient's responsibility. That information may be in existence but, because of passage of time and privacy considerations, difficult for you to obtain. You might begin by seeking out a friend or relative with whom your Father may have confided about his treatments. Also, if you have not, you would see what information is available on the death certificate. Again, most sincere sympathy for your loss. & yes, age 65 is too early. - Shu",

      "Content": "Hello Kens - Pretty much what everyone else said. At Gleason 3+3=6 there is probably no huge rush for treatment - keeping in mind you never know what the random biopsy cores missed. At age 57 you may be wanting to get more mileage out of your prostate than I did at close to 70. That might skew the decision toward radiation if/when active treatment is needed. Sex after surgery is still good, just a lot less messy. Gives new meaning to the phrase \"dry humping.\" But, yeah - I think most of the guys on the board here go for the surgery first. Done early, before the horse gets out of the barn and into the lymph nodes etc., by an experienced operating team, prospects for post surgery bladder control and erectile function are good. If the pathology report on the prostate shows containment, and the PSA is undetectable (<0.1) at the 6 week check, chances are very good you are clear of the cancer. But do let us know what you decide, and give us some progress checks. It's a good crew here, willing to share their stories. - shu",

      "Content": "Hello Kens - Pretty much what everyone else said. At Gleason 3+3=6 there is probably no huge rush for treatment - keeping in mind you never know what the random biopsy cores missed. At age 57 you may be wanting to get more mileage out of your prostate than I did at close to 70. That might skew the decision toward radiation if/when active treatment is needed. Sex after surgery is still good, just a lot less messy. Gives new meaning to the phrase \"dry humping.\" But, yeah - I think most of the guys on the board here go for the surgery first. Done early, before the horse gets out of the barn and into the lymph nodes etc., by an experienced operating team, prospects for post surgery bladder control and erectile function are good. If the pathology report on the prostate shows containment, and the PSA is undetectable (<0.1) at the 6 week check, chances are very good you are clear of the cancer. But do let us know what you decide, and give us some progress checks. It's a good crew here, willing to share their stories. - shu",

      "Content": "Hi ChiliDog. Welcome to the forum I feel qualified to speak on this, being about the same age as your Hubby - at least as to the surgery. Enervating effects of radiation or drug treatments, I have no experience. I say no reason to jump the gun quitting work. In about year 2000 I had abdominal surgery - laproscopic hernia repair, both sides. Prostatectomy was August, 2013. Following both surgeries it took a month or so to return to most normal activities not involving feats of strength. For about a year following, it was painful to stay seated for more than a half hour at a time. This may not be the case for normal prostatectomy, but for me where hernia areas were involved, it was. The solution in 2000 was to get a chair that sets in a kneeling type posture. This time I just got some spare 2x4s and plywood, and slapped together a U shaped riser to make a 'stand-up' desk. Added benefit, the computer now fits on the floor under the desk, the back-up power supply and wiring is out of view behind the riser. Also, bought a drawing table stool to sit on. As for the rest of it, about three months ago I took down and chainsawed into firewood the 2 foot diameter oak tree in my avatar picture. Tell Hubby to keep at it as long as he wants. - shu",

Hormone therapy can suppress prostate activity - thus reduce the rate of prostate cancer growth.

The choice of treatment, and holding to it, are the patient's responsibility.

I had not given much study on what to eat, and post-op just tried to refill the gut with soft, fiber and roughage rich fare. Operation day was Monday. We were in the Rotary House hotel there on the MD Anderson campus. By Thursday evening I had got all the gas out but was beginning to feel righteous well packed up from the food. About 2:00AM Friday I woke up Wife, we hopped in the car and went driving around looking for a more serious laxative. You would think there would be an all-night pharmacy in Houston close to the Texas Medical Center, but none that we found. Not on Holcomb Blvd., not on Main St. Found a stop-n-rob on Main that was at least open, locked up and selling stuff through a slot under a bullet proof glass window, but nothing in the laxative dept. to offer. So, back to the hotel. The venture did involve a fair amount of walking, and maybe that exercise and turning the gut did the trick. Immediately hit the throne room and was magnanimously rewarded. After that, as they say, the rest was easy. Wishing you an equally glorious outcome. - Shu",

      "Content": "Mario - Take ten slow deep breaths and relax. The usual way to determine if cancer is actually present is with a biopsy - taking some random core samples by way of a spring-fired needle mounted on an ultrasound head - the whole affair inserted through the anus. This procedure is not enjoyable in any way, but is endurable, and is done locally in the urologist's office. Something to keep in mind, the biopsy is *just* a random sampling. Usually if cancer is there the biopsy will rake in some of it, but since it is just a sampling it will not give a full and complete picture. So - if you are a worrier - there you are. It's what we have to deal with. The good news: 1) prostate cancers usually grow slowly, so panic is not called for here; 2) a PSA of 2 with an intact prostate is like nothing (I am not a medical professional, but that is my take on it); and 3) re-read point #1. If the urologist says not to worry, I'd be inclined to believe him/her. But to settle your mind you could always gather up the lab reports and run them by another urologist for a second opinion. Best wishes, -shu",

      "Content": "Hello Kens - Pretty much what everyone else said. At Gleason 3+3=6 there is probably no huge rush for treatment - keeping in mind you never know what the random biopsy cores missed. At age 57 you may be wanting to get more mileage out of your prostate than I did at close to 70. That might skew the decision toward radiation if/when active treatment is needed. Sex after surgery is still good, just a lot less messy. Gives new meaning to the phrase \"dry humping.\" But, yeah - I think most of the guys on the board here go for the surgery first. Done early, before the horse gets out of the barn and into the lymph nodes etc., by an experienced operating team, prospects for post surgery bladder control and erectile function are good. If the pathology report on the prostate shows containment, and the PSA is undetectable (<0.1) at the 6 week check, chances are very good you are clear of the cancer. But do let us know what you decide, and give us some progress checks. It's a good crew here, willing to share their stories. - shu",

Done early, before the horse gets out of the barn and into the lymph nodes etc., by an experienced operating team, prospects for post surgery bladder control and erectile function are good. If the pathology report on the prostate shows containment, and the PSA is undetectable (<0.1) at the 6 week check, chances are very good you are clear of the cancer.

      "Content": "Hi McNova - I'm thinking most here would agree at Gleason 6 that active surveillance is a reasonable choice - keeping in mind of course that the biopsy is just a random sample, there could be something more nefarious lurking undetected. Most here would agree, I think, that Gleason 7 (particularly if it's 4+3=7 rather than 3+4=7), at age 67 if your Dad is in generally good health, it's time to select and move forward with some treatment method. For us, at age 69 1/2, receiving the news of the biopsy cold, we went from zero to decision for surgery in probably less than 5 minutes. Among other considerations I wanted to get it done before I got any older, and before the Afraudable Care Act created more spread between Health Insurance and actual Health Care. Prostatectomy, either 'hands-in' or 'robotic' is actually a rather routine procedure. Best done sooner than later, before any tumor(s) gets away from the site. Yes, there is a percentage for incontinence or sexual function problems; We were in otherwise good health, just on the opposite side of the cusp from your Dad's Gleason 6, and were ready to accept the percentages. There is, of course, the alternative of radiation treatment. The decision of what, if any, treatment is of course your Father's. Best wishes - shu",

      "Content": "Hey, Bow - Prostatectomy is serious surgery, but also *very* commonly done. A good team will have done many procecures, seen and handled just about every problem likely to come up. There is really not a lot of pain involved. Likely you will get some high power pain meds on leaving the hospital, but most of us seems to just get on with over-the-counter stuff after the first day. The catheter is mostly a non-issue. Yeah, you will have a bag strapped to your ankle for a week or so. Keep the tip of the urethra clean and lubed. Don't push too hard getting back to normal duty - there is a lot more healing needs be done inside compared to the few cuts on the surface. Give it a couple of months. Do keep up with simple walking - gets blood flowing through the area and keeps gentle stretching during healing. Urinary control and erections vary widely with individuals. We lose the urinary sphincter at the prostate, and so are left with just the pelvic floor sphincter - the same equipment as the ladies have for urinary control. If tumors are not piercing the prostate shell, a good surgery team should leave the erectile nerves with minimal trauma. If not, and erections are important, there are other means. Having got the cancer out is a major mental comfort. Best wishes for you - Shu",

      "Content": "Mimi - Can't speak with authority to your question of why the low PSA. With family members in both paternal and maternal lines having/had PC, I started testing early. I was surprised, but compliant, when the urologist wanted a biopsy at PSA 4.0. Glad that he did. I'd say yr husband's biopsy results are what they are. If you believe them, and have selected surgery, then focus on getting ready for that. After that, settle back and wait on the pathology report - which will be released whenever it is ready. Examining the whole prostate and other removed material, along with the 6 week post-op PSA test will give a high confidence level report on whether/or not the cancer was entirely removed. Unfortunately, the operation is not reversible. It'd be nice if we could clean up the prostate and put it back in place like the carburetor on an engine. BTW, I noticed several folks posting the size of their prostate from the path. report, so I went back and looked up my own. Comparatively rather small. Perhaps that is a factor in low PSA reading vs. Gleason score. Best wishes, - shu",

      "Content": "What they said, mostly. As to pain post operative, you will likely be prescribed some heavy duty pain killer pills on release from the hospital. I took one or two, but found Advil was all that was needed. Most of us here, I think, were the same. Actual pain from the surgical wounds is not a worry. The CO2 gas needed to create the operating cavity was, for me, no problem at all - just a lot of farting. Shoulder pain from the position we are placed on the operating table, likewise was not an issue for me. The catheter can trigger sudden and intense bladder spasms, but keep the tip of the penis lubricated and should be no problem. After you start walking, the catheter is mostly must an annoyance to drag the bag around around and empty it, and an occasional distracting tug on your Johnson. Catheter removal is a non-issue. Slips right out like taking a whizz. First bowel movement is a major event. But about day 3 or 4 when you really start worrying, it'll all work out. Just watch what you eat - soft foods, soft fiber, stool softeners on schedule. A lot of discomforts, but not much real pain. By about day 3 you'll have figured out how to move around. After that, the problem is mostly to hold yourself back from trying too much too soon. There is a lot more healing needs to take place inside than the few surface cuts indicate. Rest and relax Monday, do the bowel purge stuff and fasting, you'll do fine. Best wishes - Shu",

      "Content": "Sounds like you're getting a handle on it, DogD. Ease off the liquid intake as bed-time approaches, as others have said. Coffee, tea, alcohol, etc. with caution and temperance. There will, of course, be less pressure and drip when you are supine than when vertical; but if you were not dripping or flowing as you walked from bed to toilet in yr post above, then it seems yr bod has the right idea about holding and release. Just give it time to learn and adapt. Best wishes - Shu",

      "Content": "My take: Installing the catheter is trying to push on a rope - but you're knocked out at the time, so you don't feel it. Removing it? About as painful as taking a whizz. The usual procedure is to cut the tube that drains the urine, and use a syringe to back-fill the bladder with water. Then the tube to the positioning balloon inside the bladder is cut, deflating the balloon and allowing the entire affair to be withdrawn. Then, with a filled bladder, those in attendance get to see what degree of bladder control you have. Our Catheter Class at the hospital, day after surgery, we were told if e.g. we lived really far from any medical facility, we could just cut and pull the thing ourselves - no big deal. Local Urologist, who pulled mine, said I should not have taken the 'anaspaz' bladder spasm pill that morning, since it works by clinching what sphincter we are left with, and he wanted to be sure the path was not blocked and I *could* release urine.

      "Content": "Apropos wound care: the umbilical scar from my prostatectomy two years ago has started to develop a small irritating red bump. This is, I suspect, a keloid area. You can Google up \"keloid.\" It is a type of scar reaction, a permanent raised red welt, often itchy. I've got a 1x3 cm keloid under one armpit from a spider bite about five years ago. Not fun. Sweat (it's summer in South Texas, and I've been working outside) seems to promote the formation or flame-up. There are silicone patches available OTC at pharmacies, supposed to aid in formation of normal skin (rather than scar tissue) at wound sites. Manufacturer's claims are, may I say, \"optimistic.\" But the patches do protect the area from sweat and other irritants, make it less itchy.",

      "Content": "Dog - For at least a decade before the prostate cancer issue I would several times a day feel an urgent need to pee, but little or nothing there. Did not happen at night during sleep. Each year. during the annual DRE+PSA visit I would pester the Doc about this, thinking it must be a bladder infection or something. No result. Problem gradually went away when Wife and I started doing some yoga exercises - notably stretching and relaxing the lower back. Suspect now that the phantom urinary problem was due to a nerve getting pinched; I have some rather traumatized discs in the lower spine. Best wishes - Shu",

There are particular cases where either radiation or surgery would for one reason or another be less appropriate. The folks on this board do seem to skew toward surgery, but your guy should investigate all options to make the most informed decision. Best wishes - shu",

      "Content": "Sounds good to me. About the same as we did; leave some time open both before and after. MD Anderson wanted a \"day prior\" visit (enema, brief ultrasound to measure prostate size - information for surgeon re. size of cut needed to remove bagged gland from operating cavity). We arrived Thursday evening, had Friday afternoon and Saturday to enjoy Houston. Sunday mostly devoted to the pre-op fasting and purging schedule. Report at 0500 hours Monday. By mid-afternoon, we were out of recovery and in the hospital room. Tuesday's event was a short shuffle down the hall for a catheter training class. If the hospital had required, I could have checked out that evening, but I was looking for a morning departure so both wife and I would be more rested. Wednesday early I grabbed a loose IV tree for support and we shuffled down to Starbucks at the main cafeteria for a test hike. Then back to the room and wait around for discharge. Remainder of the week was at the hotel in the hospital campus; resting, walking around the grounds or to one of the campus cafeterias, using a wheel-chair for support. By the end of the week, a couple of car trips to nearby supermarket to proof-out seating comfort for travel. When wife had some work done at MD Anderson a couple of years previous, I had split the 300 mile return trip over two days. For me, wife got the car loaded entirely by herself, and drove all the way back. Brave soul! You will be wanting to stop at least every hour + half both to walk around a bit and get the circulation going in the abdomen and legs, and to empty the catheter bag. Don't forget to snap the drain tap closed on the bag (*really*!). Yeah, you will want to keep the seat mostly laid back. Catheter came out on D+10 at a pre-scheduled appointment with the local urologist.. Gleason 3+4=7, if in good health and generally active, you should be well placed for an uneventful recovery with no permanent incontinence or erectile problems. Best wishes - shu",

      "Content": "Hello Jlynn. Welcome. You will find a bunch of guys here who have been down the path. Pratoman summed it up well for you. You have a new issue to deal with - Prostate Cancer. The good news is PC grows slowly and if detected early (as you have) may be entirely within the prostate. Prospect for a complete \"cure\" is very good. Thus there is no immediate call for panic nor despair, but G:3+4=7 is about the cusp between ..active surveillance (let's watch this and see how fast it's growing) and ..time to pick a treatment path and move on it. Get the recommended book, and educate yourselves. Of treatment paths, there are generally two: ..surgical removal of the prostate; ..radiation to kill the cancer on site. Hormone therapy, chemo, etc. are appropriate if cancer cells have escaped the prostate and lodged elsewhere in the body. With surgery the urethra is cut where the prostate joins the base of the bladder, and again immediately below the prostate. The loose ends of the urethra are sewn together; the prostate (and cancer) go to the lab. This leaves the guy without the urinary control gate that was in the prostate but still with the gate in the pelvic floor. In the words of one of my Urologists, \"you will piss like a woman.\" Most men already use that muscle, or soon learn how. There are two nerves, one running each side of the prostate, needed in erectile function. If the cancer is not at the outer shell of the prostate, a good surgeon can peel these away leaving them just temporarily stunned. Thus with the surgical path there are immediate issues of incontinence and erectile function, but both with very good prospect of recovery if the cancer is found early and the surgical team is well practiced. Of course with the prostate gone there is no seminal fluid. Sex is different after surgery - mostly, a lot less messy. Your priority in any event should be: 1) deal with the cancer; 2) be continent; 3) sexual function. Radiation, I cannot speak to other than to say ..there are different types: radio-isotope seeds placed in the prostate, externally applied beam radiation, etc. ..the cancer \"cure\" rate is about equivalent between surgery and radiation; ..radiation leaves the prostate in place but scarred - urinary and erectile function are not immediately affected, but problems may develop as areas of scarring grow. We picked surgery because ..the pathologist gets the prostate for a good look as to whether the cancer was contained or not; ..with the prostate gone, PSA drop to undetectable strongly suggests no cancerous prostate cells have escaped. As Pratoman said: educate yourselves, make your decision, and don't look back. Best wishes - Shu",

      "Content": "Hello Jlynn. Welcome. You will find a bunch of guys here who have been down the path. Pratoman summed it up well for you. You have a new issue to deal with - Prostate Cancer. The good news is PC grows slowly and if detected early (as you have) may be entirely within the prostate. Prospect for a complete \"cure\" is very good. Thus there is no immediate call for panic nor despair, but G:3+4=7 is about the cusp between ..active surveillance (let's watch this and see how fast it's growing) and ..time to pick a treatment path and move on it. Get the recommended book, and educate yourselves. Of treatment paths, there are generally two: ..surgical removal of the prostate; ..radiation to kill the cancer on site. Hormone therapy, chemo, etc. are appropriate if cancer cells have escaped the prostate and lodged elsewhere in the body. With surgery the urethra is cut where the prostate joins the base of the bladder, and again immediately below the prostate. The loose ends of the urethra are sewn together; the prostate (and cancer) go to the lab. This leaves the guy without the urinary control gate that was in the prostate but still with the gate in the pelvic floor. In the words of one of my Urologists, \"you will piss like a woman.\" Most men already use that muscle, or soon learn how. There are two nerves, one running each side of the prostate, needed in erectile function. If the cancer is not at the outer shell of the prostate, a good surgeon can peel these away leaving them just temporarily stunned. Thus with the surgical path there are immediate issues of incontinence and erectile function, but both with very good prospect of recovery if the cancer is found early and the surgical team is well practiced. Of course with the prostate gone there is no seminal fluid. Sex is different after surgery - mostly, a lot less messy. Your priority in any event should be: 1) deal with the cancer; 2) be continent; 3) sexual function. Radiation, I cannot speak to other than to say ..there are different types: radio-isotope seeds placed in the prostate, externally applied beam radiation, etc. ..the cancer \"cure\" rate is about equivalent between surgery and radiation; ..radiation leaves the prostate in place but scarred - urinary and erectile function are not immediately affected, but problems may develop as areas of scarring grow. We picked surgery because ..the pathologist gets the prostate for a good look as to whether the cancer was contained or not; ..with the prostate gone, PSA drop to undetectable strongly suggests no cancerous prostate cells have escaped. As Pratoman said: educate yourselves, make your decision, and don't look back. Best wishes - Shu",

      "Content": "Welcome aboard, tripple Fox. My thoughts: Gleason 6, active surveillance a reasonable option. Large lesion identified near bladder, time to move on it! One of my classmates described himself as an honorary member of our club. He had bladder cancer, prostate was removed along with bladder. You do not want an artificial bladder. I was 69 1/2 when we \"got the news\" of my own biopsy, immediatly opting for surgery. It was not unexpected, given my family history, In a way, it was welcome. Fact or not, we sensed that treatment availability would begin to close down after age 70 and as the Affordable Care Act came more on line. I am retired military with Medicare and Tricare.

One of my classmates described himself as an honorary member of our club. He had bladder cancer, prostate was removed along with bladder. You do not want an artificial bladder. I was 69 1/2 when we \"got the news\" of my own biopsy, immediatly opting for surgery. It was not unexpected, given my family history, In a way, it was welcome. Fact or not, we sensed that treatment availability would begin to close down after age 70 and as the Affordable Care Act came more on line. I am retired military with Medicare and Tricare.

The skill of the surgical team is important in both areas, as is the general health of the patient.

There is a third \"long term effect\" of prostatectomy which should be your primary concern. That is eradication of the cancer.

So - the technology has been around for a while. Best wishes - shu",

      "Content": "Hiwayjunkie - The \"long term effects\" of prostatectomy that concern you probably are urinary control and erectile function. At my six week post-op visit both these were well within the range which, at the time the decision for the daVinci procedure was made, I was willing to accept. The skill of the surgical team is important in both areas, as is the general health of the patient. If the tumor(s) have invaded the erectile nerve(s) then removal of the cancer, or killing in place by radiation, will necessarily harm the nerves and therefore erectile function - even in the hands of the most skilled team. You see posts on the board from men who struggle with problems of incontinence, erectile function, or both. I suspect the average post surgical outcome is closer to my own. There is a third \"long term effect\" of prostatectomy which should be your primary concern. That is eradication of the cancer. Issues in the immediate weeks following surgery are, as I and others have noted, more a convergence of discomforts (bloat, bruising/aches, bowel function, dealing with the catheter bag) than a matter of real pain. Best wishes to you - Shu",
