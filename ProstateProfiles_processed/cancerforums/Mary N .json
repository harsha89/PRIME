      "Content": "Hi, I post in another forum because I have NHL. My husband has been through several treatments for prostate cancer. 15 years ago it was discovered and it was quite severe and had become so within the year before and he was operated on. Everything seemed find for several years and then it spread again and they did radiation for 6 weeks daily. It has now been about 7 years and his psa is again going up again. He has an appointment next Tues. I think they are considering hormone therapy. Is there anything I should know? Is there any diet that might help? He is now almost 86 and really except for this he has been doing fairly well. Thanks. Mary N.",

Funny, he always just assumes he will go on forever. Anyway the doc started him on Lupron 22.5 mg every 3 months. We discussed a lot about diet and scans. The doc indicated that he would probably want him to stay on it for quite some time and said if side effects such as hot flashes are too bad there is some medicine to help.",

      "Content": "Thanks, I was wondering about if he was going to be needing scans to see if it has spread. I will question the dr if he doesn't suggest any. His psa 3 months ago was 3 and a week ago it was 10. He had his operation when he was 70 and it was fairly complete and they were not able to salvage any nerves because it was wrapped around them. He then about 7 years later had what I assume was salvage radiation because his psa went from 3 to 30 in 6 months. His psa has been less then 1 for 6 years and then it was 3, 3 months ago and now it is 10 so the doc called and we will go in on Tues. Aside from the prostrate cancer and earlier a kidney cancer that was removed completely he is in great heath. BP 120/70 and so forth but must admit he no longer goes rock climbing and I won't allow him on the roof either. Because of my NHL in my brain, I am far more aware of things spreading and have had to learn to ask a lot of questions and I want to be prepared. I must admit that because of my nhl, I am feeling much more vulnerable and a bit frightened but am thankfully really doing well according to my doc.",
