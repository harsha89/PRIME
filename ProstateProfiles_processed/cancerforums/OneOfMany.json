      "Content": "At the moment they use a fairly crude algorithm that is a simple linear function that doesn't involve any separate categories. It was developed with statistical methods that were common ten years ago. I suspect that refinements ( perhaps a gen-2 Decipher) will employ more recent multivariate methods that are now being used in genomic research. Considering the first commentary article you cited, GenomeDx might, for instance add a \"channel\" that considers the co-occurrence of elevations in SPOP, PTEN and TP53 expression (none of which are included in hte current algorithm.) Since my profile has elevations of both SPOP and TP53, I might get reclassified. Only my PTEN is low of those three. So I do understand low-risk by Decipher might still include subcategories with high risk \"triples\" or \"quads\". Whether those subcategories would be susceptible to any one of the hormonal or anti-neoplastic agents would then be a separate issue for study.",

      "Content": "The reason for thinking that proton beam therapy _should_ be more effective is that protons are rather \"heavy\" compared to x-rays. They are also physically in a different category of particle. They are therefore stopped at more predictable distances after travelling through tissue. This lets the radiotherapists and radiation physicists plan a treatment protocol that they feel is better because they know more precisely where the protons will be stopping, whereas xrays (gamma rays) deliver their energy to the tissues along their entire track. (I hope this is sufficiently clear but I admit that I sometime speak \"over people's heads\". My undergrad training was in physics and my medical training wasn't particularly helpful in bringing my vocabulary down to \"street level\".) All that said, the most recent PubMed abstracts that I have read indicate no superiority of Proton Beam therapy over external beam gamma radiation or combined brachytherapy with external beam radiation, either in mortality or side-effect probability. Since it was supposed to be superior at least with regard to side-effects, the consensus committees are not considering it \"standard\". I'm not sure whether this link will be preserved since I am a new user, but if it gets automagically deleted then you could also search PubMed with a strategy of \"proton beam prostate neoplasms review\": https://www.cancer.net/specific-type...d-side-effects",

      "Content": "I found the replies to this question somewhat interesting because of the implicit preference for surgery by the two respondents so far. I'm a retired physician, 1 year out from completing a course of ADT followed by HDR brachytherapy with EBRT boost for high-risk, multifocal GS 9=4+5. I made this decision (despite my urologists suggestion of surgery) because of the clear superiority of RT over RP in preservation of erectile function with equivalent longterm recurrence free survival. RT is also superior to RT in the significantly lower probability of either urinary incontinence or urethral stricture. There is a higher probability of radiation-induced dysuria with RT and I do have some, but my goals were to balance survival and sexual function. The criminally small number of good head-to-head comparisons (stratified by risk subsets) show survival to be equivalent and better preservation of sexual function with RT. At nine months after stopping ADT my PSA was down to 1.0 with a downward trend from the 6 month value of 1.2, so I'm seeing this as \"on-track\" with the reported trajectory of favorable outcomes after RT. (I can probably find the medical article if anyone else is interested.) My medical training included a fellowship in epidemiology and 20 years in life insurance assessment of mortality risk. In assessing life insurance risk, I alway gave preference to surgically treated cases because of the superior information from the biopsy specimen and the quick decline of PSA to <0.1, but when the decision became personal, I went for RT \"on the personal merits\". I later chose to pay for one of the biopsy-derived genetic prognostic batteries (GenomeDx's \"genomic classifier\") to decide whether to continue ADT (which I found intensely unpleasant) and after it came back very low risk (22nd percentile) I decided to stop the ADT (against my radiotherapists' advice).",
