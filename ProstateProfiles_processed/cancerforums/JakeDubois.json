      "Content": "Hi bitzman, Proton therapy is a form of radiation and can be a great resource for prostate cancer treatment. Especially since a wider beam is used when compared to \"pencil beam\" therapy (it looks like that point has been made elsewhere in your thread as well.) Here's some additional info on proton beam therapy, in case you're still researching treatment options: http://www.internationalhifu.com/tre...oton-beam.html. As far as insurance goes, I would definitely check on your specific plan to make sure at least some of the treatments are covered; as you know, Proton beam therapy isn't cheap. Even though certain companies may cover a portion of the treatments, your actual plan may/may not cover the same amount.",

      "Content": "Hi DanF, Seems like you're lucky in that your prostate isn't being aggressive. However, treatment might be a good idea. I'm not a doctor, but it sounds like you could go through with \"watchful waiting\" and keep everything under close scrutiny or could opt for a localized treatment option like HIFU: http://www.internationalhifu.com/wha...late-hifu.html. It's still in it's clinical phases, but has shown a lot of success in many prostate cancer patients throughout North America. It's minimally invasive and offers a lower risk of residual side effects, including leakage and impotence. Good luck with whatever you choose!",
