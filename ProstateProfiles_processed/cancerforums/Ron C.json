      "Content": "Thought I would start a new post just to see if anyone else has experienced this. Just had my third cystogram this morning, radiologist said there is still just a very small leak on one side, does not seem any better than last week, but the previous week it was leaking on \"both sides\" so improved. Dropped the CD off at my Doctor's office, no Docs in today but told my nurse as I have an appt. tomorrow morning to get the cath out but seems it will stay in longer. Very frustrating but from my research it seems 5-10% have the cath in four or five weeks for the leakage to stop. Nurse to call me first thing in the morning to see if Doc wants it in another week, that will make five weeks with the d%&m thing!! Anyone had this an did it resolve with extended catheter time?

      "Content": "Last week he offered to take it out but would prefer to leave it in and I went with that judgement. My understanding is the small leak might prevent further healing and create scar tissue which can constrict the urethra. Also read that if too much urine leaks into your abdomen you have a lot of pain and need the catheter put back, which is not good if the anastomosis is not completely healed. As much as I want it out I don't want to have complications down the road as opposed to just putting up with it for another week. Very frustrated. My Doc is gone for the week, visit with one of his colleagues tomorrow and will have a lot of questions as to why this is taking so long to heal properly and if there is any other option. Thanks for the thoughts, any more welcome.",

      "Content": "Update, the d?&m thing is gone!!! Doc reviewed the cystogram from yesterday and said the leak was tiny and had lessened from the previous week, I may have misunderstood the radiologist Doc. Does not matter, Uro Doc said the tiny leak in the anastomosis would close on it's own when the cath was pulled. I asked about any warning signs/pain to be aware of regarding urine leakage into the abdomen, he said not to worry, no way that was going to happen. He did say that he would have made the same call as my regular Doc last week to leave it in another week to err on the side of caution. They pulled the cath which was quick and nearly painless. Made sure I could urinate and sent me home. Thanks to all who helped relieve my anxiety on this issue. Now on to getting continent again, leaking but not bad. Unbelievable how much of a relief it is to have my \"dance partner\" gone!!",

      "Content": "Last week he offered to take it out but would prefer to leave it in and I went with that judgement. My understanding is the small leak might prevent further healing and create scar tissue which can constrict the urethra. Also read that if too much urine leaks into your abdomen you have a lot of pain and need the catheter put back, which is not good if the anastomosis is not completely healed. As much as I want it out I don't want to have complications down the road as opposed to just putting up with it for another week. Very frustrated. My Doc is gone for the week, visit with one of his colleagues tomorrow and will have a lot of questions as to why this is taking so long to heal properly and if there is any other option. Thanks for the thoughts, any more welcome.",

      "Content": "I had my blood taken again today for a second PSA to see if the first one (blood drawn within an hour of the DRE) might be artificially high due to the manipulation of the prostate. Have not had any urination issues. To be clear, my doc wants me to have the biopsy based on the DRE, did not have any PSA results at that point. He explained he could definitely feel a firmness or hard area on one side and not the other. He did give me a RX for Cipro to start two days before the biopsy. I am hesitant to cancel the biopsy, I know it has risks but they seem much less than taking a chance on not finding an early stage cancer at my age. If I was 20 yrs older my thoughts might be different. Will wait and see what the second PSA shows, should have that by Friday. If it is below 3 or so I may have further thoughts on the biopsy.",

He explained he could definitely feel a firmness or hard area on one side and not the other. He did give me a RX for Cipro to start two days before the biopsy. I am hesitant to cancel the biopsy, I know it has risks but they seem much less than taking a chance on not finding an early stage cancer at my age.

My biopsy was also Gleason 6 but what bugged me was the thought that there could be another small tumor in there that was higher grade and missed on the biopsy.

The only way to know for sure is to have surgery and they can path the entire prostate. Mine was all Gleason 6 so in theory I might have gone with AS and had the same 15 or 20 yr survival rate but I am shooting for 30 yrs as otherwise my health is good.

      "Content": "I recently had to make the same decision, you may have seen my posts. Need to get a signature set up on mine so numbers are there. My decision was a little easier as the Doc recommended a biopsy based on the DRE, did not have the PSA ahead of time. He felt a \"firmness\" on one side and turned out to be correct, I have PCa. My mistake was going for the PSA blood draw right after my DRE with him (he thought I had the blood drawn before the appt.) which was a mistake. It was a \"vigorous\" DRE as he kept checking back on forth on my prostate. My PSA had consistently been around 2.1 to 2.3 for the previous 5 years and this one came it at 5.2 which really shook me. After further discussion with him I had a second PSA test about five days later and it dropped to 3.3, still a point higher than the year before. I had the biopsy and one core out of 12 was positive for cancer, about 30% scored a Gleason 6, not too aggressive so I am having surgery soon. Very likely it is totally contained, with my \"low\" PSA and Gleason score. Assuming you followed the protocol for having the PSA blood draw (no ejaculation for at least 48 hrs, and certainly no DRE or other stimulation of the prostate) I would be a little concerned with the doubling of your PSA in two years. Your baseline of .7 is quite low, so the doubling could be explained by something else perhaps. Do you have an enlarged prostate BPH? This could explain it also. Concern is your family history, my Dad and my grandfather (his father) both had it. If you do have it, sounds very early based on your PSA. My take on the PSA is that now the concern is much more with the change, not so much a number like 4.0 or 3.5. I would probably ask for another PSA test in a week or so, but be sure they use the same lab as the 2.2, different labs can vary a few tenths. No hurry on the biopsy in my opinion, by that I mean the next few months. If your PSA goes up again after another test you probably want to have a biopsy. I was nervous about mine also, but it was no big deal. No drugs for me other than the numbing cream and local anesthetic injected in the prostate at the beginning, sounds much worse than it was. Kind of like the dentist sticking your gums with a local, just a little more sensitive place. After that it was painless. The blood in the semen after the biopsy is a little disconcerting but they warn you about that, it is harmless and goes away after a month or two. I had a little rectal pain for a week or so, but that was my hemorrhoids. I know your concerns and worry, went through it myself but feel lucky to have apparently caught it early. Don't rush into a biopsy, especially with a negative DRE, sure others here will give advice also. Read some of the posts, lots of great advice and differing opinions, you can't know too much. On the other hand I would advise to focus on the diagnosis process now as you may not even have it, hope and pray you don't.",

      "Content": "also a Merry Christmas to all!! Chief, don't let my situation about leakage concern you that much on cath removal. Like I said, both my buddies who dealt with Pca in the last few years had their caths taken out with no cystogram and no problems at all. My situation was probably complicated by having my hemorrhoids prolapse badly and six days after the prostatectomy I had surgery for those. I believe both Docs were erring on the side of caution with the cystograms though they don't think my situation slows healing of the urethra. I find that hard to believe due to the constipation I dealt with, etc. Your situation was very different. Good luck, also I think I would let them pull the cath, I am pretty tough but really would not want to do that at home. Originally Posted by NavyChief Merry Christmas all!! My JP still drains about 300cc per day. its pink and quick watery what its leaking out. I was told its lymph fluid. I really doesn't smell at all. I am wondering still if its because I am a big fat boy I do know they took a bunch of lymph nodes. I was told perhaps a week. One more thing about the catheter. I know many people have had them removed. I have read about leaks and stuff like that. I would much rather know before the catheter came out that all was good or bad. I was not conscious when it was installed. I would rather be the same way if it has to go back in to tell you the truth..",

      "Content": "I recently had to make the same decision, you may have seen my posts. Need to get a signature set up on mine so numbers are there. My decision was a little easier as the Doc recommended a biopsy based on the DRE, did not have the PSA ahead of time. He felt a \"firmness\" on one side and turned out to be correct, I have PCa. My mistake was going for the PSA blood draw right after my DRE with him (he thought I had the blood drawn before the appt.) which was a mistake. It was a \"vigorous\" DRE as he kept checking back on forth on my prostate. My PSA had consistently been around 2.1 to 2.3 for the previous 5 years and this one came it at 5.2 which really shook me. After further discussion with him I had a second PSA test about five days later and it dropped to 3.3, still a point higher than the year before. I had the biopsy and one core out of 12 was positive for cancer, about 30% scored a Gleason 6, not too aggressive so I am having surgery soon. Very likely it is totally contained, with my \"low\" PSA and Gleason score. Assuming you followed the protocol for having the PSA blood draw (no ejaculation for at least 48 hrs, and certainly no DRE or other stimulation of the prostate) I would be a little concerned with the doubling of your PSA in two years. Your baseline of .7 is quite low, so the doubling could be explained by something else perhaps. Do you have an enlarged prostate BPH? This could explain it also. Concern is your family history, my Dad and my grandfather (his father) both had it. If you do have it, sounds very early based on your PSA. My take on the PSA is that now the concern is much more with the change, not so much a number like 4.0 or 3.5. I would probably ask for another PSA test in a week or so, but be sure they use the same lab as the 2.2, different labs can vary a few tenths. No hurry on the biopsy in my opinion, by that I mean the next few months. If your PSA goes up again after another test you probably want to have a biopsy. I was nervous about mine also, but it was no big deal. No drugs for me other than the numbing cream and local anesthetic injected in the prostate at the beginning, sounds much worse than it was. Kind of like the dentist sticking your gums with a local, just a little more sensitive place. After that it was painless. The blood in the semen after the biopsy is a little disconcerting but they warn you about that, it is harmless and goes away after a month or two. I had a little rectal pain for a week or so, but that was my hemorrhoids. I know your concerns and worry, went through it myself but feel lucky to have apparently caught it early. Don't rush into a biopsy, especially with a negative DRE, sure others here will give advice also. Read some of the posts, lots of great advice and differing opinions, you can't know too much. On the other hand I would advise to focus on the diagnosis process now as you may not even have it, hope and pray you don't.",

I did discuss the erection thing with the Doc this morning and he said it is an excellent sign that nerves are working but not to worry if it does not happen spontaneously for awhile after the cath is gone. Said the cath can stimulate/irritate the nerves and may still take a bit to have one without it in place. Again though, it indicates the nerves are good, congrats!!",

      "Content": "Sounds like you are recovering well, not sure on the drain thing, mine was taken out the day after surgery. As far as the bladder spasms, they put me on vesicare for a week to help prevent them with instructions to stop 48 hrs before catheter removal. I am into my 24th with the catheter but only taking the vesicare occasionally. My doc had me do a cystogram in the radiology dept. 10 days after surgery and it showed a slight leakage around the anastomosis (urethra reattachment) so wanted the cath in another week. Went last Tuesday for another cystogram and still just a tiny amount of leakage. He said we could pull it but preferred to leave it another week or so and as annoying as this thing is I went with his call. Last thing I wanted was to have it removed and then need to put it back in!! Supposed to have it out Thursday that will put me at 27 days! Not sure why some Docs do the cystogram and some don't, two of my buddies had them out it ten days, no cystogram and no problems. Can't help you on the incontinence thing of course, but for the last week I have had the semi wood in the middle of the night and it does hurt but I consider that a good pain because it probably really good news on the ED issue. Doc confirmed that this is excellent news. If the spasms are causing a lot of discomfort you might ask them about vesicare, they just gave me free sample boxes to use as needed. Just need to stop a couple of days before cath removal as it might make you unable to urinate. Hang in there. Ron",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear about your shingles, I had it also about four years ago. Will relate my story here for future reference by others. Mine was herpes zoster oticus, the type of shingles that starts in the inner ear. I attribute mine to being out for my step son's college football game in 38 degree weather and windy. Forecast was 50 and sunny!! Ears got cold and about five days later I had a bad but intermittent ear ache. My family doc missed it and put me on antibiotics. Two days later I had red rash on my face and bad pain. My fiance (now my lovely wife) took me to the ER in the small town where she lived at the time. I was anxious wishing I was going to a major hospital ER. Young foreign born ER Doc nailed the diagnosis even before he came into the exam room based upon what nurse told him. So much for thinking I would do better back in the city!! He also asked my permission to have several of the medical staff on duty come in and observe my symptoms as this type of shingles in uncommon. Glad to do it. He put me on Valtrex (valacyclovir) the anti viral drug also used for \"that other herpes\" and told me it may work for me, but it needs to be started within 48 hrs of symptoms to help much. Also put me on Prednisone for the inflammation and vicodan for pain. I was lucky within a few days no new lesions and all the others started healing. Hurt like h$ll for about three days but prednisone and pain killers helped. Could not wait to get off both!! Within 10 days I was fine except for some scabs healing the lesions. Followed up with a another family doc a few days later, who said he had never seen this type in 25 yrs of practice. Also wanted to show his staff, I guess I should have collected a consulting fee LOL!! Interesting thing about the vaccine is this Doc said I would not need it as my immune system had the best vaccine possible, a bad case of the virus. I have read that some recent studies indicate there is a small chance of getting it again so may get the vaccine myself. The chicken pox virus never leaves your body, just hides in the nerves where your immune system keeps it at bay. Only when your immune system is weakened for some reason can it escape and hurt you. Anyone who has had chicken pox should get the vaccine, Zostavax. As far as the Valtrex, sounds like you may have had it for too long a time for the drug to help. I was just lucky. Hope you are better soon, know your pain. I did have some occasional postherpetic neuralgia after I healed up, the tingling with some pain. That decreased over time and was more of an annoyance than painful after a couple of months. Went away almost completely after a year.",
