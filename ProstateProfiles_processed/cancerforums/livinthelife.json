      "Content": "Thank you for all your replies. My husband is a patient at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. He has been on AS for one year but at a different hospital in a different city. One year ago, he had one core of 3+3=6. We moved to AZ a couple of years ago. His biopsy last year indicted one 3+3 Gleason scores. A month ago he had his annual biopsy which showed several 4+3 Gleason scores and 3+4 scores. His PSA has been up and down for several years now with the highest being 12.7. Here are his PSA levels: 1996 - Aug. 2014 Range = 1 - 5.4 Sept. 2014 - 6.9 Feb. 2016 - 10.7 June 2016 - 8.2 Feb. 2017 - 11 July 2017 - 12.7 The Mayo Clinic scheduled his bone scan and CT for abdomen and pelvic on 9/13. We believe this is the first available appointment time. What does it mean he has \"9 positive cores\"? Also, he does have an enlarged prostate but not for a 75 year old. If that makes sense. Thanks again for all the good advice.",
