      "Content": "First I thank all of you for responding to my other post. I am still trying to wrap my head around the fact that his PSA was within \"normal limits\" I'm starting to wonder what \"normal limits\" are!!! No red flags but within 6 months went from 3.6 to 7.13 with gleeson of 4+3 and a met on pelvic Iliac bone. This just seemed TOO FAST ... how can this happen within six months? Or was it there before? I know he has adenocarcinoma cancer which is written in the biopsy. Am waiting to see medical oncologist even though husband is on lupron shot, generic casodex and prolia for the bones,from the urologist. This means ANYONE can be walking around having had their PSA test seem normal and can have cancer without knowing it! I don't know if his was sitting in him a long time or the six months was the time this all happened? Than the PSA test is not reliable as he has a normal DRE also. Can anyone help with this?",

      "Content": "Hi everyone new here speaking about my hubby. He never missed an annual physical-always had PSA and DRE ,seems it jumped in 6 months from 3.6 to 7.1, than 7.8 -did biopsy and lo and behold it was PC . Gleason 4+3 . The crazy thing is he has a met to pelvic bone so urologist put him on casodex generic and he just had his first Lupron shot which he will take every 4 months, and a shot to prevent osteoporosis. Trying to assimilate this at one time. Urologist says anytime it goes out of the prostate it's termed stage 4. I know his father had it (but for some reason never went for treatment and no one knew so when he started having severe bone pain it was too late! ) His brother had it and they removed it. He has 4 other brothers but as of now nothing and hope they remain that way. How did this go so fast? He was always checked! And his gleason and PSA were not overly high! What now?",

      "Content": "Thank you for all the replies. Very informative ,because of the fact he had all of his tests done at the Northshore /long island Jewish radiology center I assumed they were very spot on with their findings as that is considered a very good facility associated with a very good hospital, I figured they had so many of these scans, etc that they knew which was a met and which wasn't Chuck asked my husband's age he will be 66 this month. Is BPH an enlarged prostate? He always had a slightly enlarged prostate -not too much according to the Doctor . I am so new to this (unfortunately) that I have to learn the \"language\" . Urologist said when it goes to a bone area or distant area it's considered stage 4. When urologist went over past history there was a small steady rise throughout the years but not outside of the normal limits. Dr said as person gets older it rises. That is why hearing what u all say about the PSA not being high enough for a met is baffling ,one would think the radiologists and pathologists who deal with this all the time would be able to decipher the readings. So confused. He's on the generic casodex, and Lupton shot now,and will be getting a shot also for his bones to be strong (denusab?) Will go for second opinion of course.
