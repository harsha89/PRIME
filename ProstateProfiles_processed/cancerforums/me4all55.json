If he had advanced cancer, maybe a urinary catheter would provide some relief. Good luck to you both. We are from india. PSA is 14.98 , Serum Chromogranin A Test : Negative , PET CT Scan : Shows a Lesion in the Peripheral Region of the Prostate 8cm * 7cm also there a Lesion near the lymph node 3cm. Is it Very painful to Use Urinary catheter? How long can he use it. Do he need a surgery for that?",

Do scans, blood test, wait for the report. this is what happening since last 2 months. No Treatment at all. My dad is not been able to sleep at least for an hour. Whenever he sleeps, he feels like going to Toilet. May be some of you might have also going through these problems. Doctors are only concerned about shrinking the tumor and no one is bothered about the trouble the patient is facing every day. I kindly request all to suggest your ideas to overcome this problem.",

Every article on the internet is telling that the growth is aggressive. But none of the doctors are not taking any Immediate action to suppress the growth. Doctors are telling that surgery is not possible because of the Tumor Size. So only chemo and radiation is the choice. Has any one heard of CyberKnife Radiation therapy. Is it effective to Shrink the Tumor. I Started boosting his immune system with lots of fruits and vegetable juices hoping that might stop metastasize. Don't know whether it is a bad dream or real.
