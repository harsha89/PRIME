His Gleason score is 6...8...9 and deemed \"very aggressive\". He is 68 years old. We see an oncologist monday. At this point we have been told that it is all contained in the prostate. He is leaning towards radiation and not surgery. Any helpful info will be VERY much appreciated. This is all new to us as we have not had cancer in our family. We are in the Toledo, Ohio area.",
