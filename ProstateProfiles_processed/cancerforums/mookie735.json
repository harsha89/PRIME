      "Content": "Hello All, I'm a 42 yo male. I'm having some really scary symptoms that I believe may be advanced PC. About a week ago I started to have some stomach, pelvic and groin pain. It felt like a mix between a burning sensation and soreness. I went in to see my GP based on these symptoms. He recommended the standard CBC blood test and an ultrasound of my abdomen. The blood test came back normal. The day before I took the ultrasound I noticed that now I was having pains in my lower back and my thighs. My back felt really stiff and my thighs, quads and groin were on fire. This pain has only gotten worse and now my lower legs and armpits are starting to hurt. Of course I went to the Internet and started searching (panicking). Based on what I read about my symptoms I called my GP and requested he do a PSA. Yesterday I did the ultrasound and the PSA test. I received the results today. The ultrasound was normal and the PSA had a reading of 0.6. I've never had a DRE but that is about to change. The scary part of all of this is that I still have ALL of the symptoms and I've been reading about low PSA's with bone metastasis (and lymph node) still occurring. Should I be worried? I'm going to have the DRE next week but my weekend is going to suck with all of the worrying. All replys are welcome.... Thanks",

      "Content": "Hello everyone. I just wanted to give an update of my status. I had the DRE performed by a Gastro doc a couple of weeks ago. He said that all looks well. The weird thing is that I still have the same symptoms (burning pain in the groin, pelvis, hips, legs, back, stomach and sometimes under my armpits). I went to the emergency room last Friday because I was having some trouble catching my breath. I was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy five years ago so the ER did an EKG, chest X-ray, and a CT scan with dye on my pelvis/stomach/chest area. This also came back normal. My GP sent me to see a neurologist on Monday and he did a few tests on nerve related stuff. All were good. The neurologist wants to do a thoracic MRI to see if there is anything there but my point is this.....something is wrong with me and so far I don't have an idea what it could be. With my symptoms I naturally assumed some type of cancer that might have spread to lymph nodes, bones and other areas. With each new test I feel better to know that nothing is found but worried that nothing is found. Thanks for hearing me out.....",

      "Content": "Hi Hope2012, thanks for your reply. I'm sorry to hear about your dad's passing. My doctor didn't really say anything about my PSA request other than that it wasn't covered by my insurance plan. My insurance provider will only pay for it once you reach 45 but I thought it was worth it. I mean it's only my life. I did mention to him that I had an uncle who was diagnosed with PC in 1999. My uncle is doing fine but his daughter (my cousin) recently passed from breast cancer after a 10 year battle. I'm definitely going to have the DRE next week and if this pain doesn't go away soon I will continue to push my GP to help me figure out what is going on. All my prayers to everyone who is going through a battle with cancer....",
