It is ADT resistant and there are supposedly only 46 cases known [47 now]. No stats to go on for predictive behavgior. No drugs being researched due to no market.

      "Content": "I have two bits of news. 1) The urologist activated my artificial sphincter yesterday and it works great. There is, however, the issue of sitting down. When the cuff is inflated I sit smack on top of it and BOY does it hurt after a few minutes. Sitting on it also makes it work less effectively and if I squirm I leak a bit. A donut on my seat solves the problem. Its a small price to pay for not having to wear pads anymore. 2) My doubling rate hit the 1 year mark with yesterday's PSA test. I'm going to have conversations with my urologist and with an 'alternative therapist' he is recommending. I have refused radiation. I will likely refuse chemo unless they can offer some strong reasons not to. I don't want ATD, but have a responsibility to my family and to my congregation, so if it comes down to that I'll likely take it. Question: Are there any other post-prostatectomy therapies that have hit the mainstream in the last 4.5 years since my surgery? A discussion beyond simple names of therapies would be welcome.",

      "Content": "True, I have refused radiation and would not have had the sphincter installed had I planned on going that route. Radiation and artificial sphincter are, as far as I have learned from listening to my urologist, not compatible. ADT just sounds so distasteful, yet it is apparently my best, next option. Its interesting to note that my urologist has suggested that the rapid rise in my latest PSA may be a result of my sphincter surgery. Thanks for your input on other followups. Some I knew but others are new to me. Good fodder for investigation. I will continue to report in as I progress so others have another point of comparison - though certainly not a 'route-to-follow'. Every man's PC is different and everyone's journey takes different turns. Blessings,",
