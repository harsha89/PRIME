Marty I'm curious what you are doing now then. Edex not good enough, Trimix too painful. FYI...i've been doing a lot of reading, and I've read several times that when the pain is too much (not from needle, but from Trimix), it is often a sign of too high a dose. What does your Dr. think about it? Also, some reading I've done has indicated many are getting better results if using a C Ring too. Although, I'm a bit confused as to when you put that on. I have ordered a couple different ones to try.",
