      "Content": "Once all of my testing was completed I had a couple of options, radiation or surgery. First option presented was Hormone treatment and radiation sounded like a plan I was ready to get started and get treated. Next day had an appointment with urologist and he said either option should give me same results, said he was a surgeon and thought taking it out would work out real well. Two days later met with Dr John Popadopalous at MD Anderson in Houston and he agreed with surgery. Wife and I discussed and decided to get it removed, because of gleason 9, felt MD Anderson could treat cancer better IF it returned. Had surgery on 7/28/17, recovering really well. Received call from Dr. on Monday, day catheter left my body, to let me know 24 lymph nodes removed and were all cancer free. Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has posted here, your post have helped me so much.",
