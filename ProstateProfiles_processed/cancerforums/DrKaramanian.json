Disclaimer: This is general medical information and does not establish a physician-patient relationship. There are different types of spreading, local extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis. A 3T multiparametric MRI is a good test for evaluating extracapsular extension: direct outgrowth of a tumor in the prostate through and beyond the capsule. Surgery is the gold standard because they can cut up the tissue and look at it under a microscope. The MRI is also good at looking for seminal vesicle invasion, although not quite as good. Not ejaculating for 3 days prior to the MRI helps the seminal vesicles fill with fluid and makes tumor invasion easier to identify. Lymph node involvement is possible to be seen, but if it is microscopic, will generally not be seen with MRI. A surgical lymph node dissection can pick up microscopic disease in the prostate, but again, this is because the pathologist can look at it under a microscope. Distant metastasis (e.g., metastasis to the spine) obviously won't be seen on a prostate MRI. I hope this helps clarify the role of MRI. Best regards, Ara Karamanian, MD",

      "Content": "Hi Joe, Disclaimer: I offer this as general medical information. This does not establish a physician-patient relationship. You must go to a qualified physician for your evaluation and treatment. Background: PI-RADS is a reporting tool that helps standardize the reads of multiparametric MRI. We are now in PI-RADS version 2, and the benefits of the PI-RADS has been prospectively validated in the radiology literature. A TRUS biopsy has only about a 70-80% sensitivity for a clinically significant prostate cancer. A 3T multiparametric MRI performed reasonably well has a greater than 90% sensitivity for clinically significant prostate cancer. Makes me wonder why we don't always start with the MRI, but I digress. So a TRUS biopsy is going to miss about 1 out of 4 clinically significant prostate cancers. Your situation: You have an elevated PSA, a PI-RADS 4 lesion. I cannot speak precisely to your situation, but in general a patient in this situation usually needs an image guided biopsy. There are three ways of doing this: 1) MRI guided in-bore biopsy. This is the gold standard. The interventional radiologist who performs this procedure can actually see the biopsy device go through the lesion under MRI. 2) Fusion biopsy. The MRI images are overlaid on top of the ultrasound images, and the urologist tries to hit the same area using ultrasound guidance. This approach is less expensive than an in-bore biopsy, but less accurate especially for small lesions. Results are definitely superior than a TRUS biopsy. 3) Cognitive fusion. The urologist tries to hit the spot from the MRI based on fusing the images in his or her mind. This approach is not recommended given the better options we have now (MRI in-bore biopsy or fusion). Given the advances of MRI imaging for prostate cancer, this opens the possibility of focal treatment such as MRI guided focal laser ablation. The benefits of focal treatment are significantly fewer side effects, but long term studies showing improved overall survival have yet to be performed (because the technology is new). There are short term studies, and I am preparing the largest study to date for publication later this year. Best regards, Ara Karamanian, MD",

Probably the best study to answer your question is entitled \"Long-Term Follow-Up of a Large Active Surveillance Cohort of Patients With Prostate Cancer.\" http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/earl...4.55.1192.full This study was lead by Dr. Laurence Klotz, a respected leader in active surveillance.
