    "Content": "I've included my Stats in my signature. I'm sixty years old and overall great health. Basically current PSA is 5.8 rising between 0.7 and 1/year over the past two years. I've had two MRIs. The first was negative and the second showed a suspicious area. Subsequent fusion biopsy took 19 cores. Of those 19 there was one positive a Gleason 6 with 70% involvement. Three cores from the suspicious area were negative as were twelve standard random cores. The positive core was anterior at the left lateral apex. I seem to be low risk but just beyond what is commonly recommended for active surveillance. My PSA density is 0.17 and it is recommended at <0.15 and although it is only 1 core it is 70% and usually recommended <50%. I have a follow up pending with my urologist in a month but over the phone he said I will likely need to do something at some point. While I realize there could be more disease than is evident than on the biopsy since I have had two MRIs and 19 cores out of what is a relatively small prostate not too concerned. My feeling is decisions should be based on what is and not what could be. I tend to agree that since my PSA seems to be rising and the core was 70% some action is required. My initial though is to try to treat this focally. I realize this is not mainstream and I may need to pay out of pocket. But with what appears to be low risk disease initial whole gland treatment may be more than I need. Don't want the cure to be worse than the disease.
