Please spare me from having to slug through the posts trying to get to the information I'm looking for. I have elected to allow my prostate cancer to run its course. There's more than enough information on what you can do to fight it, how much it will cost, that sort of thing. I'm working towards putting a plan in place that will anticipate all of my \"final living needs\" (as opposed to \"final buring needs\"). To this end can anyone share with me what I should expect as the cancer progresses, what things I can do to remain \"operational\", at what point I'll no longer be \"operational\", and how long between that occurs and when death occurs? To help you understand, I'm a Crohn's patient and I've been fighting that disease for 35+ years. As a result of disease, surgery, Xrays, secondary infections and the like my prostate is encapsulated in a scar material fortress (they could only get 3 samples, the scar material broke most of the needles). Going in to address the prostate would more than likely total both my rectum and my bladder (cure worse than the disease).",
