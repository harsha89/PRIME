      "Content": "Hello everyone, I am 67 years old. My PSA went up from 2.6 to 3.6 in the last year. I had my very first visit to a urologist last week. Quick normal digital rectal exam was followed with the urine collection. The urine sample was submitted to Exosome Diagnostics Lab. The ExoDx Report showed up few days later with the IntelliScore of 26% which is above cut off point of 15.6% for high risk of high-grade prostate cancer. The urologist wants to perform ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. I am concerned why I was not not given any other options such as MP 3T MRI or simple monitoring for now. Should I entirely rely on doctor's plan based on the IntelliScore only? I am thinking of getting second opinion from a different urologist. Any other suggestions? Appreciate your help!",
