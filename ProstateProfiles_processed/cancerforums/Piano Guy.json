    "Content": "Well, this has been quite a ride I thought I'd just post my experience and some things I've learned along the way in the hope that it could help others. I\u2019m 57, 5\u201910, 170 lbs and in good shape. I just had robotic surgery last Wednesday. I was nudged by my wife to get a physical in November, 2013. The employer we have our health insurance offers to pay for the initial $700 co-pay for a major medical procedure if you have an annual health affidavit filled out. The primary care Dr. suggested I have a complete blood work up since I hadn\u2019t had any done for awhile. My PSA came up at 5.8. The Dr. said that this coupled with the fact that my brother had prostate cancer 10 years ago at 51 \u201cEarns me a trip to the urologist.\u201d I scheduled a visit with Dr. Richard Greenberg, Chief of Urologic Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center. He brought me up to speed on where I was, options, etc. He started me on meds to treat my enlarged prostate that I had as a start. My father who was involved in helping my brother ten years ago as well as an older friend with advanced prostate cancer gave me some advice. He suggested I visit the University of Pennsylvania in Phileadelphia. A friend of his who is the retired president of another major teaching hospital in Philadelphia spoke well of Penn when he was seeking advice for my brother\u2019s treatment of prostate cancer. I made an appointment for Feb. 2014 with Dr. Alan J. Wein Professor and Chief of the Division of Urology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Dr. Wein, despite me being the last patient of the day spent a long time examining me and giving me an overview of what might lay ahead, options to consider, etc. If I wanted to know if I had prostate cancer the next step would be to have a needle biopsy. On 2/24/14 I had the biopsy done at Penn. 17 cores and about a third of them showed cancer. A follow up bone scan and MRI were done. No evidence that the cancer had spread. I consulted with Dr. Neha Vapiwala at Penn to see if radiation treatment might be an option. Due to my age, 57, and very good health she recommended surgery as opposed to radiation. At another appointment with Dr. Wein, he reviewed my options but at the end of the day surgery was my best option, and sooner rather than waiting due to the number of positive cancer cores found with the biopsy. He only does open surgery but suggested I consult with another surgeon to hear about robotic surgery. Initially I was going to see his associate Dr. Thomas Guzzo. Based on some online research it seemed that Dr. David Lee at Penn Presbyterian Hospital was the \u201cgo to guy\u201d for robotic prostate surgery in the Philadelphia area. He does between 8-10 of these surgeries a week and has done well over 3000 of them. He had also operated on a co-worker who was pleased. On 4/10/14 my wife and I had an appointment with Dr. Lee. I had a list of questions for him. Any of the negative things I read about robotic surgery online were explained. I asked for the specific percentages of his surgical outcomes were. He knew those from memory and even suggested what mine would be due to my good health going in. I found that he even offers having a super pubic catheter instead of the traditional Foley catheter from the penis, something I had read that was offered at a hospital in Texas. Going in we thought we were going to hear what he did and decide later. At the end we decided to schedule surgery. I was given a lot of information about what to do before the surgery and attended a class before surgery that covered a lot of questions, issues and what recovery to expect. I reported to Penn Presbyterian at 5:30 AM and had the surgery last Wednesday (6/4/14). By early afternoon I was up walking. At midnight the same day of the surgery I was able to do 6 laps of the floor I was on walking at a normal walking pace. I was discharged at 11:30 AM the next day. On Friday, the day after I was discharged we went to the shore for the weekend. On Saturday we spent the afternoon on the beach. With the super pubic catheter the tube came out of an incision in my abdomen. There\u2019s a valve below the tube before the bag. On Sunday morning I was told to close the valve which allows regular urination. A bit painful at first, then just uncomfortable. Five days after surgery I was urinating normally, only using the bag at night. I made the 2 hour drive from the New Jersey shore to our home with no problem. On Tuesday AM of this week I returned to the hospital and one of Dr. Lee\u2019s Physicians Assistants removed the catheter tube from my abdomen and I was cleared to drive. She told me that I was a poster child for this type of surgery. The surgery only took 1 Â½ hours, I was up walking well the same day and I was continent 4 days after surgery. On Wednesday a week after surgery I returned to work for a half day. (With a little bit of convincing on my part since I can scale my work back to be sitting at an office chair most of the time.) On Wednesday and Thursday evenings we took our granddaughters to a local fair. On Thursday I went to work all day. This morning I woke up with a mild erection, something we were not expecting to see for some time. At this point I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the progress. Some things I learned and advice: 1. Don\u2019t believe everything you read on the Internet. You can prove or disprove just about any opinion you have by some web page. Much of the negative things I read about robotic surgery was not true. 2. You really HAVE TO READ The Prostate Monologues: What Every Man Can Learn from My Humbling, Confusing, and Sometimes Comical Battle With Prostate Cancer The author takes you through his journey from when he first was diagnosed through his surgery. He very fairly presents the options available for treatment. Again, if you have prostate cancer this is a must read book. 3. Get in shape The better condition you are health wise the better your recovery will be. I got to my present weight by using an app called My Fitness Pal which tracks very easily your calorie intake and exercise so you can make good choices. Although I started this some time before I was diagnosed I went from 184 lbs. to 170 lbs. I\u2019m never hungry and eat well. 4. YOU need to decide who and where you\u2019ll be treated. My primary care Dr. suggested two local urologists. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty close to you,\u201d was the reason I should see them. They\u2019re not who I saw. 5. Don\u2019t choose your treatment based on hearing of a bad experience by someone. In the Prostate Monologues, the author tells of a man who had terrible results from robotic surgery. His surgeon was even the head of urology at a regional hospital. It was only later that the patient found out that his surgeon did not have the amount of experience at the da Vinci machine. 6. In choosing a surgeon the main thing is how good they are and how many surgeries they do. That will typically be at a major teaching hospital. You can get excellent results with open surgery with an experienced surgeon and lousy results with robotic surgery if that surgeon has not done many. My brother flew to Chicago and had his surgery by Dr. Catalona. He\u2019s the guy that pushed for the use of the PSA for diagnosing prostate cancer and has great results with open surgery. I was fortunate to be about an hour from Philadelphia. If I wasn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to travel or fly to where I could get the best Doctor and treatment. 7. Surgery is not your only option. In my case it was pretty clear that it was. If I was 73 and in poorer health that may not have been what I would have chosen. 8. Take your wife on a vacation. We went to Jamaica for a week in February and a couple of trips to the shore right before surgery. 9. Your support network of friends, your faith and prayer are important. We\u2019re friends with a couple who have a strong faith in God. Over the last year the wife has been battling cancer. Observing how they dealt with this crisis mentored me as to how to face this in my life. Their faith in God being in control and working in her healing gave them peace. I had many friends praying for us. Knowing you have cancer can really challenge you emotionally. Most nights however I replayed this verse in my mind as I tried to fall asleep: Lamentations 3:22-23 Because of the Lord\u2019s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.",
