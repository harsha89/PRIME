I am in the UK, btw. But chose your forum as it seemed particularly active. There will, no doubt, be some differences in medical terminology, drug names etc. We are lucky in the UK to have a FREE National Health Service (NHS) so no real incentive to buy medical insurance and I certainly could not pay for medical treatment anyway.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Walnut It's a mystery. How does the stress of that damage to your home figure into the urinary retention??????? Apparently stress hit you very hard. How does that figure into the high PSA??? Here's a fact. One PSA doesn't prove anything. I would say proceed with stress counseling, second and third opinions and get a state of the art MRI at a highly rated facility. You can always get a biopsy if the MRI shows something suspicious. I did wonder if anyone has also experienced acute urinary retention following stress. It is certainly mentioned as a cause here: http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/artic/...orks_niddk.htm. But I don't know if stress can lead to a high PSA as I cannot find anything on the internet about it and I forgot to ask my consultant that question. Sorry, I forgot to mention that I had a biopsy today.",
