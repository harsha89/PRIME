      "Content": "Hello everyone, I hope this post finds everyone well. I am pretty scared, and being the hypochondriac I'am, I have stressed myself out to A whole new level. If someone can give me any advice or guidance I would be so appreciative. Here is what happened: I'am 32 year old Male, I have been on Testosterone Therapy on and off for a few years, my wife and I are trying to have kids, so we went to see a urologist. The urologist suggested I take a semen analysis, I had one, the next day was my usual regular doctor appointment. Since he is the one who has me on Testosterone Therapy he wanted to do the normal blood work, but this time he also tested my psa levels. My psa levels came high 5.63, My Dr. was very concerned and referred me to a urologist, but I just saw the one who I have been seeing for the baby issues. I know my psa can be higher due to the semen analysis the day before, the semen analysis was about 24-26 hours before my blood was taken for the psa test, which came out to be A whopping 5.63 I put myself on Cipro 500mg twice daily, I had been on it for two days, and then had my appoint with my urologist. He was very nice, and told me most likely it is nothing, he stated he was not going to do A DRE, but put me on A anti-inflammatory for 4 weeks, because he has seen many cases similar to mine, in-fact not to long ago he saw a patient my age with a psa level of 80. From there he stated, to return back in 4 weeks and re-test again, he would not even talk about prostate cancer with me, because he said no need to worry yourself just yet. He noticed how stressed I was. I suggested the doctor to give me another Psa test as well as test my free psa level, he said he would gladly, but it would be best if i just checked entirely after the 4 weeks process of my medication regimen was completed, but I insisted. Today I got my PSA test, I did not have any sort of ejaculation for about a week. Today my psa score came back 4.8, and my free psa level was 19!!! I know it should be 25 or greater. Now I am more worried, I can not eat, or think, I am so stressed out, and the only things going through my head is death, I am sorry to say. No one in my family has cancer or prostate cancer. My father is around 65, his psa is 6 but he is normal, my uncle, (fathers brothers) Psa test came in above 8, and I think his free psa level were below 10, after biopsy, no cancer. I do not have any kind of problems what so ever, but I am so scared, I am so stressed, I want to cry, but I do not want my wife to see me week and loose hope, I know its much to early, but my test results do state something, and from my research it is not good. Anyone? Any words would help, I just need someone to talk to, and I rather not do it with family, some say I'm just being my Hypochondriac self, while some just worry, and I wish not to worry anyone. Thank you friends..",

      "Content": "Otago: Thank you very much for your words, in-fact they mean a lot: Yes I know my second test results was much to soon, but the Dr. agreed to do it, just because I asked As far as Testosterone Therapy goes, I was put on it by my proctologist. Years ago I had A fistula, it spread, from left to right, I had to get 4 surgeries, that went all the way behind my scrotum, the surgeries were very abrasive, after the surgery my Testosterone level did not go back to normal for a very long time, even after I was fully healed, so my Doctor then suggested Testosterone Therapy, which helped me a great deal, but I have been of testosterone. I will read the book you sent me tonight: Thank you very much.",

      "Content": "Thank you Otago. Ill do exactly as you said and will read it all after I get done with this reply.. Lastly my according to semen analysis, my sperm count was about a million, I guess 10,000,000 is of the norm, my first Urologist (I saw him only once, he is rude, so know I see another one, the one who I went to for my PSA readings) stated it is mostly due to my testosterone use, but could it be related to Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis? Before my wife, i got my ex pregnant, and I was on much more Testosterone then, when I met my wife, My doctor cut my dose by more then half.",
