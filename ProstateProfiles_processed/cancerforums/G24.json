      "Content": "Tim, I agree with your surgeon, if you have a Gleason 9 you have a high risk of recurrence. On the other hand, if 24 lymph nodes are clear, you may not recur. As long as your testosterone is low and you did not get resistant to ADT, your PSA stays low. If you interrupt the ADT e.g. now, after about a year the testosterone will recover and your PSA value will probably rise. But you can live with that, a PSA value will not kill you. I understand that you are having ADT now. Since you are high risk, it is correct to combine the radiation with ADT. Here is a trial that shows how long high risk patients will live if they had two years of ADT after surgery. Most of them well over ten years. G24",
