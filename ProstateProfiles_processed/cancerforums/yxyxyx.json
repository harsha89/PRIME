      "Content": "HighlanderCFH, Thank you very much for your response. I am 74 years old. Let me repeat some information about my prostate cancer: One month ago I was performed TURP prostate surgery for urine retention that told I got prostate cancer with Gleason 4 + 5 = 9. After that I did NM Bone Scan that \u201cMultifocal activity in patient with provided history of prostate cancer is concerning for metastatic disease. Lesions, however, do not correlate with pelvic bone CT finding\u201d. Also I did CT Pelvis W Con \u201cPelvic lymphadenopathy demonstrated. 1.8, 1.9, 2.0 cm\u201d. But in last years (2016) I did three times of PSA test. The results are 3.085, 3.567, 2.889 that misled me and my urology doctor that delayed the finding prostate cancer in early stage. Four and half years ago (September 2012) I was taken TURP prostate surgery that the result showed I had 2 ships cancer in total 156 chips (1.28%, of course this percentage is very low). That time (2012), Gleason was 4 + 3 = 7 (only 1.28% of total chips). My doctor told me that we \u201cwait and watch\u201d and my understanding is we \u201cwatch PSA\u201d. In the four and half years I took total 11 times of PSA test. The results are: 3.07, 2.831, 4.319, 3.287, 3.064, 3.257, 4.033, 4.466, 3.085, 3.567, 2.889 (3 times PSA was higher than 4 in the four and half years). The doctor told me I do not have risk for prostate cancer (now the doctor retired). You gave suggestion that I should take second biopsy to confirm my Gleason? I do not know how can I ask second doctor to view my sample cut in one month ago. Even I do not know they keep the sample or not? Or can I ask second doctor to view and re-evaluate the images taken one month ago. Can I do that? Thank you again.",
