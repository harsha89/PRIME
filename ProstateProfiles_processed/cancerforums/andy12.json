      "Content": "Yes, of course, anything can change at any time. A meteor could fall out of the sky and knock your head off. Do you spend a lot of time worrying about that? I think the way we play the cards we are dealt is less about the psychology of pca and more about the psychology of us, as individuals. I have a similar diagnosis to yours, four years now. I have explicit trust in my doctor and continue on AS. My PSA has never been higher than the 4.2 that triggered the biopsy (along with family history--brother) in 2015. Most recently, last month, it was 2.5. I really don't think much about cancer. I live in a pleasant climate, I am fit and healthy, I have wonderful grandchildren that make me smile and laugh. I know that hearing the word \"cancer\" is frightening. But as we hear over and over on this forum, prostate cancer when caught early is very treatable, even curable. I had a neighbor who had radical prostatectomy when he was 51. He died last fall at the age of 81 from heart disease. It really sounds like your doctor and you are ahead of the curve on your situation. That is a good thing. If the meteor is coming at you, you will see it well in advance. Yes, get outside and exercise. And then, do it some more.",

You\u2019re coming at it from a different perspective and clarity, having the benefit of time with it. This is a month old for me, not quite that (although I\u2019ve been in the testing loop for a year). Unfortunately, we don\u2019t go through this in a vacuum. I think if I could get everything else to stop falling apart of once, I\u2019d be in decent shape. I\u2019m managing this pca and several life adjustments all at the same time. It\u2019s hard not to feel like you\u2019re being hit with a tsunami at times. So we have exercise and life distractions (grandkids). I don\u2019t want any grandkids right now though, my kids are 20 and 16! Sorry, I guess I misunderstood when you said, \"Maybe we can all pitch in ideas about how we cope with this mess we find ourselves in\". I thought you were looking for ideas, not sympathy. In my opinion, it is as simple as I state. I can use my mind to either make things better or make things worse. It's up to me. I have been a member of this forum for four years and have posted 20 times. You have been a member for one year and have posted 285 times. Maybe you need to give yourself a break. Look, no one can tell you what is going to happen five years from now but the fact is that you currently have a very low level cancer and you are on top of it. Are you aware that there is even discussion among urologists and pathologists as to whether Gleason 3+3 should even be classified as cancer? This is just me pitching in ideas, but I really think your glass is half full, man.",

His advice was active surveillance which I had no problem agreeing to. Six months later my PSA had dropped to mid 3's; six months later, low 3's; six months later, high 2's; last week, 2.3. Will do it again in six months one month after my 68th birthday. My doctor, who I trust explicitly, remains very comfortable with active surveillance, as do I. I look at this forum often enough to know that many people have very serious cases that need to be dealt with aggressively. There are, however, cases like mine where active surveillance seems totally appropriate. My doctor says that he has seen hundreds of cancers like mine and has never known one to metastasize. I understand that when it comes to cells in our bodies, crazy things can happen at any given moment, so I am not forgetting that I have this diagnosis. PSA checks every six months will be my routine. This post is not designed to give anyone here any advice. It is just my current story.",

      "Content": "Thank you, Chuck & Otago; your thoughts and info are very helpful. Yes Chuck, the March PSA could have been affected by a couple of the things you mentioned. The July PSA, no. So, that makes sense. Otago, my brother is 2 years older than me and was diagnosed when he was 62, five years ago. I don't know any of the numbers associated with his pc but do know that he had seeds and radiation. We don't talk much but when we do he says things are good, PSA not going crazy. I have been having PSA's for the last 6 or 7 years. I don't have year by year but they were always around 2 until March, 2014, when it was 3.1. Doctor wasn't alarmed at the time, then came the 4.2 this past March that triggered the biopsy. And then, of course, came the 3.1 this month. I am not freaked out by this diagnosis and am sleeping soundly every night, as you suggest, Otago. I have read professional articles where it is suggested that Gleason 6 should not even be classified as cancer. My plan is to stick with AS for the next year, have another biopsy, and then probably put this thing on the back burner.",

      "Content": "65 years of age, PSA was 4.2 in March, doctor did biopsy; I also have a brother with pc. 12 cores, 2 were 5%, Gleason 6. Doctor recommended active surveillance. PSA in July, four months later, was 3.1. I was surprised by this, expecting it to be the same or higher, but not lower. He gave an explanation that I didn't totally understand. Anyone have experience with this occurrence, or knowledge of it? Thank you. (BTW, I like my doctor a lot; he is excellent).",

Doesnt statistically say at this high number generally points towards a higher cancer risk? Well yes, it is high, which is exactly why I would want confirmation. Results of your second check will just take a few days so you won't have to wait very long. Statistically yes, lower PSA is better news than higher.
