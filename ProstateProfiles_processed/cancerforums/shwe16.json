      "Content": "Hi everyone, Thanks for the replies! I've gone through all his reports since the beginning of his diagnosis, and all the numbers are correct. They only found the PCa because my dad had mistakenly said his father passed from PCa, when it was actually pancreatic cancer. The doctor pushed for an MRI, which incidentally found the cancer. His PSA was and still lingers around 0.6. The urologist is also pretty confused as to why it spread. Like DjinTonic and Michael F said, the biopsy might have just missed a more aggressive cancer. In fact, the biopsy concluded the tissue in his left prostatic lobe was benign, but it did light up on the PET scan. I'm also not the most hopeful about it being a misdiagnosis, because from what i'm getting around the internet, there are very few other reasons for a PET scan to be lighting up in areas of bone. Of course, we're going to wait for the bone biopsy before going ahead with any treatment. I think it is the only way we'll truly know whether or not it is metastasis. Am definitely a pessimist by nature - which I know doesn't help anything.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, The last few weeks have just been a roller coaster of emotions. My dad was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. Following an MRI which showed a 6mm PIRADs 4 lesion, he underwent a fusion biopsy. The biopsy showed Gleason 6(3+3) cancer in 1/14 cores, in less than 10% of the core. His PSA was 0.6. Despite this, his doctor decided to send him for a Gallium-68 PET scan \"just in case\". He predicted that the scan would be negative, and stated that it was likely my dad would die of unrelated causes. However, during our consultation to review the scan results today, he said the scan found bone mets on my dad's right pelvic bone. He mentioned the possibility of benign causes, but him and a few other specialists are pretty certain that it is metastasis. There were no mets found in any of my dad's lymph nodes and seminal vessels. My dad will be having the suspicious areas biopsied next week, but I'm just really confused. Nothing seems to be adding up - His low grade cancer, his low PSA, and the fact the there are no signs of cancer in his lymph nodes/seminal vessels. How did the cancer end up in his bones? If it really is cancer, it essentially takes him from being a candidate for active surveillance to Stage IV. My mother is beside herself with grief. My dad is her best friend, and they do everything together. I think my dad is also really upset, but is trying to keep it together for the family. Can anyone make sense of this situation? Would also appreciate any Stage IV survivor stories (just to help in the hope department).",
