      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Tell your husband that, as long as his surgeon is highly experienced (at least 300 da Vinci's) & competent, he has nothing to worry about. Just contemplating surgery is a scary thought, especially to someone like me -- who considers having my teeth cleaned to be a major procedure. I had previously had only one surgery, but I was only 2-3 years old & do not remember it. Let your husband know that, from my experience, he is simply going to go to sleep & wake up later without cancer. He'll be sleepy the rest of the day & will hopefully get a good night's sleep before coming back home the next day. There really is very LITTLE, if any, pain from the surgery. The meds will see to that over the first couple days. After this, all I needed was Extra Strength Tylenol -- and I'm not even sure if I needed that -- just didn't want to take any chances. LOL If you can give us your husband's various stats, we can offer more comments -- such as his PSA readings over the past few years, his biopsy stats (Gleason scores, how many positive cores, staging, etc). Tell him to look forward to that day as the day he regains his health. Take care, Chuck His PSA was 9.58 he hadn't seen a Dr. in 4 years so I made him an appointment and won the battle of him going. His Dr. sent him to a urologist, biopsy was a gleason of 3+3=6, 7 out of 14 cores were positive for cancer. I have been his number one supporter and always will be. I think as time gets closer reality is kicking in. He has never had surgery and finally opened up to me the other night with the \"what if's\". He said he was even considering not to have the surgery. ED is what he is really concerned about. He is a very young 56 year old and NEVER sick. I wish they would have scheduled the surgery sooner because it gave him too much time to think. We were watching the news the other night and there was a women on there that had robotics and her bladder had been burned. Just what he needed to see right?",
