    "Content": "Hello, On 4 July 2017 I had my cancerous prostate surgically removed with 6 keyholes and computer controlled operation. I am happy with the op and now can control my bladder 99% of the time. Now, 20 September 2017 I experience uncomfortable pain in my shoulders and acute pain at certain movements in my right arm. My GP couldn't explain this and sent me for a shoulder X-ray. This only showed some age related wear in the bone joint. If I lift my right arm behind my head, as when pulling off a pullover, it gives me extreme pain. Could the cause of this be a blood clot? I am 71 and in general health, but I do not feel my GP is really taking this very seriously.Thank you for reading this. If you have any suggestions I would be most interested. Jeremy Haywood",
